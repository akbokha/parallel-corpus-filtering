package &amp; package ; includes various modules for &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; despite their small size , they offer some additional functions and simplify the use of some features of &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or , by making them more readily available .
more information about the use of &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; and the built @-@ in functions can be found in the manual on &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; .
to load these modules in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or , select Options to set up extensions .... Open the card card utilities and select the desired modules there .
this is a list of standard modules from the box k@@ de ; add@@ ons . please note that if you have additional software installed , you may need more modules on your system .
you should install the k@@ de@@ base package , which contains &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; before you compile this package .
to use the crash module , click in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; on Tools tab . then you can view the page , the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; to crash , or the list of crashes , if available , delete .
the module An@@ gle Filter ( also called Fol@@ der Filter ) can be found in the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; menu bar under Extras bar filter . with the module you can filter &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; &apos;s current working directory in different ways .
to use the DO@@ M tree view in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or , select Extras DO@@ M tree ... and open a new window with the DO@@ M of the currently displayed web page . as default , the display starts with the root node of the document , for example : docum@@ ent@@ Item , all other nodes are sub @-@ elements of this root node .
the module &amp; FS@@ View ; for &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; provides a further view for objects with the MI@@ ME @-@ type in@@ ode / directory with local files . it can be used as an alternative for the various tool@@ bars and text views to view the contents of your local file system .
the special feature of &amp; FS@@ View is to display ne@@ sted folder hierarch@@ ies with the help of a so @-@ called tree map . tree maps allow the representation of the size of objects in ne@@ sted structures . each object is represented by a rect@@ angle whose area is proportional to its size . this size must possess the property that the sum of the sizes of the lower objects of an object is smaller or equal to the size of the object .
at &amp; FS@@ View , the size of a file or folder reflects the size of a folder as the sum of the size of the entries in it . thus , large files can be easily identified even if they are far below in the folder hierarchy . accordingly , &amp; FS@@ View can be considered as a graphical and interactive version of the &amp; UNIX ; command .
in &amp; FS@@ View , an entry in the Tre@@ em@@ ap representation is a rect@@ angle that represents a file or folder in your fil@@ esystem . for easier navigation , the rect@@ angles have useful color and labelling settings .
the color of a rect@@ angle that is switched over view color mode can be either depth for easy detection of the ne@@ sting depth or the image of another file property like name , owner , group or MI@@ ME type .
a rect@@ angle can be lab@@ eled with the different properties of the respective file or folder . for each feature , you can specify whether it is displayed at all , only if there is sufficient space for the representation or whether the area of subordin@@ ate rect@@ angles is to be used ( whereby , therefore , you can specify the relative position of the let@@ tering in the rect@@ angle .
with representation algorithms for tre@@ em@@ aps , the rule should be observed that the area is proportional to the size of the entry . in the Tre@@ em@@ ap in &amp; FS@@ View , this goal is not always maintained . frames are drawn to indicate the ne@@ sting of entries , and this framework will need space , which is then lost to the subordin@@ ate entries , if the rect@@ angle is square .
how to partition the area of an entry for the subordin@@ ate entries is left to the implementation . here , it is always advantageous for the lab@@ eling and avoid@@ ance of space losses through boxes so that rect@@ angles are created that are as square as possible . the best methods in this respect are rows , columns or recur@@ sive division .
you can set the minimal displayed area for an entry via the View An@@ alogue button . instead , a diamond pattern is drawn into the area of the parent entry to indicate that this area is actually occupied by a subordin@@ ate entry .
originally , &amp; FS@@ View was designed as a small test application and introduction to the use of the Tre@@ e@@ Map wid@@ get developed for the K@@ C@@ ach@@ eg@@ r@@ ind application .
the Picture Gallery module can be found in the &amp; Con@@ quer@@ or ; menu under Extras picture gallery ... or using C@@ trl ; I .
when you visit the Picture Gallery module , a dialog opens that allows you to set the image of the gallery .
the option Tit@@ le of the page allows you to customize the title of the picture gallery page in a text entry field .
the images per line option has a sli@@ der and a screen@@ shot to adjust the number of thumb@@ nails of each line in the gallery .
with the check box file name of the image , specify whether the file names will be displayed in the gallery under the thumb@@ nails .
with the check@@ box File Size of the image , specify whether the file size is displayed in the gallery under the thumb@@ nails .
with the image size check box , specify whether the size of the images will be displayed in the gallery in the gallery .
in the Fol@@ der dialog , specify where the gallery is stored and which sub@@ folders should be included .
in the Save In HTML file , specify where to save the HTML page .
you can set the sub @-@ folder to the sub @-@ folder using a sli@@ der or a screen@@ shot to which level the sub@@ folders will be included .
copy the original pictures with the check boxes to see if the original pictures are to be copied to the gallery .
using the comment box in the comment box , you can specify a comment file for the cap@@ tion of the images in the gallery .
in the check box O@@ wn color depth you can specify a different color depth for the thumb@@ nails than in the original pictures .
the module &amp; HTML ; -@@ Settings provides easy access to general &amp; HTML ; -@@ Settings for &amp; Con@@ quer@@ or ; .
the module &amp; HTML ; -@@ Settings can be found in the &amp; Con@@ quer@@ or ; menu under Tools HTML Settings . the following behavior of the web browser can be specified here :

an easy @-@ to @-@ use camera interface will be provided for you to connect to your digital camera and download your photos directly in &amp; digi@@ cam ; albums . more than 1000 digital cameras are supported by the g@@ photo@@ 2 library . of course , every medium and card reader that is supported by your operating system will work together .
you can use these to view , comment , evaluate and correct your photos . the editing capabilities can be easily expanded with K@@ DE Image Plugins Interface ( manual ) modules .
although &amp; digi@@ kam ; easy to use , it provides dozens of professional capabilities . it works complete in 16 @-@ bit color space and all available modules support the raw conversion by li@@ bra@@ w , D@@ NG Export and ICC color management workflow .
improved database with significantly more metadata , such as &amp; eg ; via camera or lens , which can be searched .
like all ; programs are also &amp; digi@@ kam ; an open source project . that means it depends on the support of the end users . therefore , you should report problems and improvement opportunities .
if you are in the program , your web browser will open a page in the error report system . if you use these links , your web browser will open a page in the error report system . all the information you need is entered here . just follow the instructions to send your report .
&amp; digi@@ kam ; is a project supported by a community . that is , the user and developer will help each other . if you are a regular user of &amp; digi@@ kam ; then we would like to encourage you to answer questions about other users by &amp; digi@@ kam . in this mailing list , however , English is spoken , you should therefore be powerful in this language .
you can also visit the digi@@ plug ; visit homepage to learn news on released versions and other information about &amp; digi@@ kam ; learn .
the best start to participate in &amp; digi@@ kam ; participate is registration in the developer mailing list . instructions for logging in the developer mailing list by &amp; digi@@ kam ; .
when you start &amp; Edit ; for the first time , you will be asked where to save your images and your database . you can specify a local , remote or removable folder . simply enter the path name or click the Fol@@ der icon Fol@@ der icon to select a folder .
in the second field you need to specify a local folder on your computer . here the data storage is saved . this path remains the same for all image folders .
later you can add as many folders as you would like to add . &amp; digi@@ kam ; you will additionally use as an alpha library .
if you already have a picture collection on your hard disk , you can specify the top folder that contains images as a base folder . &amp; Edit ; considers every sub@@ folder as an album . no image will be changed .
&amp; Edit ; thir@@ sts recur@@ sively the library path in its full depth . you cannot exclude sub@@ folders unless it is i@@ ste in hidden folders . this can be done by placing one point in front of the name of the sub@@ folder .
if you take an existing folder with photos as a base folder , you will notice that the albums in My Al@@ ben@@ list do not have any photos as symbols . you can change them by taking any photo from the album and put it on the folder icon .
once you have configured the base folder , you can set up your digital camera ; then you should learn how to use my albums and my keywords to manage your photos in the albums .
raw file support : if you use the raw mode of your camera , you can also deal with it . support is based on the li@@ bra@@ w library . if you want to find out if a special camera is supported , you will find a list of supported raw cameras in the Help menu support .
how to set up this and work with raw files is described in the sections of Ro@@ h Dec@@ oder@@ 2 and Ro@@ h workflow .
an easy @-@ to @-@ use camera interface will be provided for you to connect to your digital camera and download your photos directly in &amp; digi@@ cam ; albums . more than 1000 digital cameras are supported by the g@@ photo@@ 2 library . of course , every medium and card reader that is supported by your operating system will work together .
modern digital cameras are characterized by the use of Compact &amp; Flash ; memory cards and USB or Fire@@ Wire ( I@@ EE@@ E @-@ 13@@ 94 or i @-@ Link ) for data transmission . the camera then appears as disk drive . the connection can also be realized via the Picture Transfer Protocol ( P@@ TP ) and its deriv@@ atives . older cameras may use the serial port ( RS @-@ 232 ) .
g@@ photo@@ 2 is a free , re@@ distribut@@ able software collection for digital cameras that supports an ever increasing number of more than 800 cameras . g@@ photo@@ 2 also supports Picture Transfer Protocol , a widely distributed protocol developed by the International Imaging Industry Association . it allows the transmission of images from digital cameras to computers and other periph@@ er@@ als without the need for additional drivers .
many old digital cameras use the serial port for their communication with the computer . since photos in general are large files and transfers over the serial port are slow , this connection is now dep@@ rec@@ ated . &amp; digi@@ kam ; supports these cameras and performs the transmission of images with g@@ photo@@ 2 . a complete list of supported cameras can be found under this link .
lib@@ g@@ photo@@ 2 has to be created with li@@ be@@ x@@ if support to reliably read the thumb@@ nails of digi@@ K@@ am . the Ex@@ if support is needed by some lib@@ g@@ photo@@ 2 camera operators to read the preview images . if the Ex@@ if support is not present in lib@@ g@@ photo@@ 2 , you may not see thumb@@ nails or the creation could be very slow .
one of the most beautiful things on &amp; digi@@ kam ; is how easy it is to extend its functionality through modules :
K@@ IP@@ I modules : the K@@ DE Image Plugins Interface Project ( manual ) is an approach to develop a common module structure for &amp; digi@@ kam ; , K@@ Photo@@ Album , Sho@@ wi@@ mg and G@@ wen@@ view . the goal is to provide the modules with all graphics programs . the settings for the K@@ IP@@ I modules are described in this section .
modules can manipul@@ ate pictures in virtually any way as it can be a user . their advantage is that it is much easier to add &amp; digi@@ kam ; by writing a small module to supplement a function when the changes in &amp; digi@@ kam ; even perform .
to simplify the window , you can either remove the page he@@ aders with or L@@ MB ; or switch to full screen mode with F@@ 11 or C@@ trl + Shift + F .
drag and drop pictures works everywhere : you can place an image in another part of the tree , above the horizontal dividing line or to another application window . the only limitation is that a picture cannot be stored in keywords , data list or search .
- a file type selection allows you to extract the most common formats : JPEG , PNG , TIFF , Ro@@ h , Mo@@ vies and Audio
the text filter is only used for the fields currently displayed in the symbol view . thus the filter works on the fil@@ en@@ ame only if it is displayed in the symbol view . which fields are displayed you can configure in the settings dialog .
the view &amp; quot ; My Al@@ ben@@ li@@ ste@@ quot ; provides an organized view of your photo albums . all the photos that are stored by &amp; digi@@ kam are stored in a single album tree . these albums can be sorted by the folders in which they were created on the disk , after the name of their collection in the album properties or after the date on which the album was first created .
if you have set up a scanner , you can also scan a photo directly into an album . select album Import images . you can also add a screen@@ shot directly to an album .
to copy or move an image from one album to another , you can move the photo with the mouse to the target album and drop it there . in the then appearing menu you have to select whether the image is moved by moving or copying . simply select all the photos and move them to the target album .
an album contains a collection of photos and the album features allow you to enter information about this collection . to access the album features , right click on the album and select Edit properties in the contex@@ tual menu .
album Coll@@ ections : are a method to select your albums so that you can be group@@ ed under a common name . the collection you set will be used to sort your photos after collection from the toolbar or sort view albums by collection . if you want to add or delete new collections , you can do so in the collections for collections .
the album date : is used when you sort your albums after date with View albums after date sort .
buttons El@@ der , A@@ verage , New Year : these set the date on that of the oldest , the newest picture or the average of the album . to do this , first try to calculate the average of the images from their EX@@ IF information . if this fails , the date of last modification of each file will be used in this folder instead .
if you first have an album in &amp; digi@@ kam ; open , the first picture in the album is chosen as a symbol for the &amp; quot ; My Al@@ ben@@ li@@ ste@@ quot ; this should help you to remember the photos in the album . sometimes the first picture in the album is not representative and you may want to select another photo as a symbol .
to select another photo as an album symbol , you must click the picture with the right mouse button and select it in the context menu &amp; quot ; As al@@ bum@@ Pre@@ preview start@@ en@@ quot ; . in addition , you can drag the photo to the album in the list to set it as a symbol .
an album can only be included in a collection and collections can &apos;t be ne@@ sted .
you can use both methods to organize your photos . you can use both methods to organize your photos .
the image window will provide you with the main view of your photos . if you select an album , all images will be displayed in this album in the image window . each photo is displayed in a preview , you can adjust the size of these preview with the two magni@@ fier buttons in the toolbar .
when you open an album the first time you have to wait briefly while the thumb@@ nails are generated . this can be avoided by using the Tools menu to recre@@ ate all thumb@@ nails .
information on each image is displayed below the associated preview . what information is this , you can change settings ; set up the albums page and adjust the preview images to your wishes .
the preview images have help windows that appear . if you leave the mouse poin@@ ter a moment over a picture . the help shows the most important features including all the keywords of a photo . the screen@@ shot at the top of the section introduction to the main window shows such a help window .
photos are all that happened at &amp; digi@@ kam ; go . albums and tags allow you to organize your pictures in a way that suits you . the image editing shows your photos and allows you to achieve a number of improvements to these . you can choose between viewing the images , a slide show or editing the images .
you can open the image editing with a photo by selecting either F@@ 4 image editing ... or the context menu of the image with the right mouse button and edit ... . in the Edit section , you will find a tutorial on how to edit your photos . with image editing , you can view your photos and change them .
it may happen that &amp; digi@@ kam ; the functionality you need is not available . you can open a photo in another program by selecting the context menu with the right mouse button and selecting the program from the File Type sub@@ menu .
you should note that after processing other image editing programs , there may be problems with the metadata that appears in the image . some programs do not store this data when you save the modified image . thus , this information is lost from the EX@@ IF@@ - and IP@@ TC data , such as orientation , aperture , etc .
the easiest way is to click the right mouse button on the preview and select Rot@@ ate . in the sub@@ menu you can specify the degree of rotation .
to change the fil@@ en@@ ame of a photo , right click on the preview and select F@@ 2 ren@@ ame from the context menu . note that you retain the extension ( .@@ j@@ pg , .@@ tif , etc ; ) .
if you want to delete a photo , it will be moved to the garbage bin of &amp; k@@ de ; F@@ 8 Del@@ ete or Del If you prefer to really delete , you can use this by using Shift ; Del .
the view &amp; quot ; My Dat@@ um@@ sli@@ ste@@ alth ; organizes your photos using the data . &amp; digi@@ kam ; use either the EX@@ IF date or , if this is not available , the date of last modification of the file .
if you select a month from the list , all photos of this month will be shown in the image view . you can select days or weeks in the date sheet at the bottom of the calendar view , so that only the photos of the selected days will be shown to you .
photos with keywords provide a flexible and powerful way to organize and catalog your photos . tags are sti@@ ckers that can be assigned to individual photos or entire groups . once a keyword is assigned to a photo , the photo can be found by selecting this keyword or a search .
when a keyword is selected , all the photos marked with this keyword will be displayed .
tags can be sorted in a hierarch@@ ical tree . this allows you to lo@@ gically organize your keywords . you can also find parts of the tree &amp; quot ; My keywords li@@ ste@@ quot ; to work together so that you can easily find the keywords you are looking for .
the keywords are stored in a database for quick access and assigned keyword in the IP@@ TC data fields of the image , at least for JPEG , so you can also use your keywords in other programs .
you can add new keywords by using the right mouse button either on &amp; quot ; My keywords , or click on an existing keyword and then select New keyword . if you have cli@@ cked on an existing keyword , this will be the for@@ e@@ word of this keyword .
you can delete a keyword by clicking on the keyword with the right mouse button and selecting Del@@ ete . if you delete a keyword , the photo itself will not be deleted . only the keyword will be removed from this photo .
you can change the position of a keyword by dra@@ gging it to the desired position in the tree and dropping it there . then a menu appears that gives you the possibility to move the keyword . a keyword can be at a time only once in the tree .
you can change the properties of a keyword by clicking it with the right mouse button and selecting Edit in the context menu . you can change the name of the keyword and the icon in the tree &amp; quot ; My keywords quot ; .
to select another photo as an album symbol , you must click the picture with the right mouse button and select Add as album preview in the context menu . in addition , you can drag the photo to the album in the list to set it as a symbol .
to be able to use keywords , you first have to assign your photos with keywords . this can be done in two ways : once you have selected the photos you want to add to a keyword , you can click on the corresponding keyword in the tree &amp; quot ; My keywords quot ; drag and drop it . alternatively , you can also click with the right mouse button on the preview of the pictures and select from the contex@@ tual menu .
you can add a photo with any number of words . the photo is displayed once you select one of the keywords assigned to it . in this way you can enter a keyword for each person in a photo , one for the place where the photo was taken , one for the event in which it was made etc .
once you have provided a photo with keywords , it will be displayed in the main window under the preview of the image .
you can remove a keyword in which you can use the right mouse button to open the pop@@ up context menu and select Remove from the Tags menu . the menu only displays the keywords associated with the photo .
the tim@@ eline view shows a time @-@ dependent adjustable hist@@ ogram of the number of images per time unit . a selection frame can be moved over this hist@@ ogram . to select a time frame , you only need to click on the lower rect@@ angle of the selection frame , which indicates the time unit . this displays all the associated images in the main window .
in the field below , you can enter a title and save your selection . it then appears in the list below .
includes all the elements of the database : names , reviews , keywords , keywords , albums , collections , date stamps and more .
next to the search box , a small lamp is the green when finding hits . if you click here the filter will be deleted and all images will be shown again . if the search has not found , then the lamp becomes red .
the more advanced search tool is hidden in the tab in the left side@@ bar with the bin@@ oc@@ ulars . if you open this you get a simple search box as described above . you can save this search here but as a live search , which always filters what you entered as search criteria . after you have saved the appearing filter in the list .
if you are satisfied with your selection , press the head OK and the search will be done . the results will be displayed in the View My Search list in the main window . if you want to change your search again , you only need to select the respective entry from the View My Search list and select an option in its context menu .
if you select to edit search , the search form will appear again with the previously entered search information . if you select to edit as advanced search , the dialog will appear for advanced search to change your previous search . more information can be found in the Advanced search tool .
if you want to delete an existing search from the list , select Del@@ ete from the context menu .
the Advanced search provides you with an extended search form with many search options , with which you can search in certain fields of &amp; digi@@ kam ; s database .
the list of search rules is used to set the options for a search query in the database . an option can be added to this list with search group or delete it . each option can be connected to others through the logical operations All ... , One ... , Not ... or At least ...
each image is characterized by a long number with a special technique using the hair algorithm . this allows to compare images by comparing these signatures . the smaller the difference between two pic@@ torial signatures , the more they correspond . this technique is applied in three areas .
similar entries : this is an area in which you can drop every picture to find a similar . by means of a sw@@ ell@@ ert , the result selection can be enlarged or reduced . if you push a picture from anywhere via the icon of in@@ accurate search in the left side@@ bar , it will open and you can drop it there .
sketch : free hand color sketch : draw a quick sketch and &amp; digi@@ kam ; find the right images . here too , a threshold value can be set .
this tab provides an intuitive card search tool based on the Mar@@ ble mini program . you can zoom in or out with the mouse wheel or hold it down and move it . move it while you press the left mouse button . press C@@ trl ; left mouse button to move a square . all images within these coordinates are filtered and displayed . of course , this requires your images to contain ge@@ o @-@ data .
in the field below you can specify a name for your ge@@ o filter . it will then be added for later use of the list below . it works like a live ge@@ o folder .
&amp; digi@@ kam ; provides a luminous table in a separate window that allows you to easily compare images . it works with all supported image file formats , including raw files .
select one or more images from any view in the main window and then use C@@ trl ; L Add to the illuminated table from the context menu . the selection will be added to the illuminated table and its window will open . if you are back in the main window , you can quickly open the illuminated table with L Tools .
from the preview toolbar , you can drag and drop the images you want to compare in the left or right pane of the window . a small arrow shows you which copy in which window area to see . if you select to synchron@@ ize from the toolbar and perform zoo and / or move operations on one of the images , they are also executed in the other image . you can therefore compare the same area of the two images .
another mode is better suited for sorting out from a picture series . if you navigate in pairs from the toolbar , the two first images are automatically loaded into the pane to compare it . now use the left mouse button on any preview image to display it in the left pane .
of course , the normal deletion actions also work directly from the lighting table such as F@@ 4 File Edi@@ ting ....
all image information from the right side@@ bar of the main window is available for both thumb@@ nails in the illuminated table . this makes it easy to link visual differences with exposure data .
at the bottom of each area you will find a built @-@ in pi@@ v@@ ot function that you can recognize on the crossed arrows . to swing the visible area of the image , you have to click them and hold the &amp; L@@ MB ; then both images will be displayed in the same image area .
zoom in just the same way as in other views . just use the zoom sli@@ der below the images or C@@ trl ; mouse wheel to zoom in and out . this happens in both pictures when you are in the preview mode .
digital inventory management considers every part of the process that follows after the image has been made to final output and permanent storage . each of the photos records , scans or stores digital photos performs a form of digital inventory management . however , most of us do not make this in a systematic and efficient way .
we give you a tool , a plan and practical tips on how to back up , find , protect , and re@@ use your pictures . we will focus on the process for digital photographers who use &amp; digi@@ kam . we will consider downloading , ren@@ aming , removing , converting , group@@ ing , securing , evaluating , wa@@ xing , archiving , editing , waiting and ex@@ porting image files .
&amp; quot ; Digital inventory management records , inde@@ xes , categ@@ ori@@ zes , sec@@ ures , searches , transform@@ ations , and exports content that has a monetary or cultural value .
metadata is defined as data about data . metadata is data that provides information about or documentation from other data managed by an application or environment , according to your definition .
I dare to say if you find more than 1000 photos on your computer , then you need no longer inventory management to find a certain photo . if you do not even know how many photos you have , then use certainly not &amp; digi@@ kam ; . the approach to save metadata in both a database and image files guarantees very fast searches and secure archiving that you can freely access with other programs , platforms and formats .
the first thing you need to do and know before you incorporate something into your system is the structure of information structure in contrast to the data structure . your image files have to be organized somehow on your computer . you need to decide if you want to have access to your photos , whether you want to save them to a dedicated drive or on a network drive &amp; etc .
you may be happy with this structure . holiday pictures can quickly be found on your location unless you were in one year several times in the same place . if you make enough photos , then you will use sub@@ folders like &amp; eg ; 2008 @-@ 01 , 2008 @-@ 02 &amp; etc ; then export is a folder for images you print or publish on a website .
professional photographers have other requirements , e.g. version@@ ing of photos , archiving , work@@ flows , constant supply of images to different themes and a large number of everything . within 10 years 95 % archives and 5 % work files will have and you will then not want to re@@ organize your structure for this content .
what types of files fit together ? the separation of file types makes batch processing easier . separate new from old files .
the separation of original and working files simplifies a backup strategy and migration . you will always know if you are looking for an original or a deriv@@ ative image .
we also recommend the Save Metad@@ ata option in the Edit Settings page . this ensures that EX@@ IF and IP@@ TC data are written into the file . if you forget this , you can subsequently save the metadata from the database in the files by selecting the respective point in the Album menu .
now you have a lot of information in your database , but what happens if you want to change what ? added &amp; digi@@ kam ; a metadata editor for a number of selected attributes . these are of course the most important ones .
now the real work begins , as you should now assign keywords , cap@@ tions and a rating to each photo . of course , you can select all the images that require the same attribute and then set the value . they start best with the rating or ranking . this makes sense as you can concentrate on the best photos during the next work .
now let &apos;s talk with keywords , keywords , as you frequently call other programs , or categories . all three are syn@@ ony@@ ms for the same thing .
when you import catalo@@ gu@@ ed images from another source with embedded keywords , then &amp; digi@@ kam ; automatically create the tree for you or insert the images to the right place . changing the hierarchy within the tree is no problem and can simply be done by dra@@ gging a sub@@ tree to another .
the graphic shows how different met@@ a @-@ met@@ a is overl@@ apping . this is a very crude representation , since each block of metadata is in truth from many sections . file names and calendar data are properties of all images .
enough of the keywords - the next section refers to cap@@ tions or comments , the third important tool to catalog your metadata .
most of the time you just want to see your photos , you want to share them with your friends , family , other photographers and agencies . you are certainly interested in how your photos arrive .
look at this panorama . from the distance is not even a beautiful beach panorama . if you look at it closer then you catch some details to see people , the place .
and now I tell you that this is the landing place of the Al@@ lies &amp; quot ; O@@ ma@@ ha Be@@ ach@@ quot ; in the French Nor@@ mand@@ y 60 years after the landing . w@@ ow ! you begin to dream , to have associations , memories , the historical period is again present , you may even hear the silence .
for others who consider your photos , the title may be more important than the image itself to create an interest . if you show pictures you should tell a story . remember , the key is to transmit the meaning to the viewer , to help him understand the subject that you are moving to understand what you understand .
it is fine if an image is not perfect , if it has the strength only to work with a label for itself alone .
with &amp; digi@@ kam ; you can save as much text , in an internation@@ alized alphab@@ et ( U@@ TF @-@ 8 ) , as a let@@ tering . you can even export it for a selection of images . if you export your images to web galleries , these labels will not tell you a second time for publication .
remember the times ahead of GPS ? when you had to find a different city without a navigation system ? wasn &apos;t Earth a boring planet in front of Goo@@ gle@@ Earth ? well , because with pictures , the train of the spatial presentation is already running with speed of light .
the possibilities to exploit the ge@@ olo@@ cation are countless and will become deep in the future . I &apos;m sure that one day , in the near future , you can virtually repeat your travels with Google Earth images . you can also export the images to G@@ aller@@ y@@ 2 , Pic@@ as@@ a@@ web , Fli@@ ck@@ r &amp; etc ; with the Goo@@ gle@@ Maps viewer .
&amp; quot ; Cop@@ y@@ left is a pu@@ n with copyright and uses the practice to use copy@@ rights to remove restrictions on the distribution and modification of copies . the same fre@@ edoms are also valid in all changed versions , so also for the work of others .
the following description tells you which information in the setup page of &amp; digi@@ kam ; should be stored as information :
author ( syn@@ onym for creator and writer ) : this field should contain your name , or the name of the person who created the photo . if it is not desired to protect the name of the photographer , e.g. to protect the identity of the photographer , then the name of a company or organization may not be changed . this field does not support comm@@ as or sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ ons as separ@@ ator .
author title ( syn@@ onym for author ) : linked to the author . this field contains the photographer &apos;s job description . examples of this may be title as : employee photographer , freelance photographer or independent commercial photographer .
editor ( syn@@ onym for providers ) : use the provider field to identify who offers the photo . this does not necessarily have to be the author . if the photographer works for a news agency like Reu@@ ters or Associated Press , these organizations can be listed here that you offer the picture to others .
it is very important to fill the author and copyright sections although they do not offer protection against mis@@ use . anyone who has a little more than basic knowledge in the work with calcul@@ ator can delete or modify this , in the image embedded metadata . for private persons , this is very important for the majority of your photos . for professionals and semi @-@ professionals this protection is very important .
the digital water@@ mark is unique per picture . &amp; digi@@ kam ; will provide such a module for batch processing in the near future .

of course we don &apos;t talk about CDs that have been lost on the street or on a fire . these kinds of losses are the same that can happen to you in traditional paper photos or neg@@ atives . in this section you will find problems with the so @-@ called New Media .
K@@ roll on@@ TRA@@ CK , the world &apos;s largest data recovery company , has some interesting statistics what reasons a data loss has .
to fight the problem with CDs / DVDs , these must be treated cau@@ ti@@ ously and you can &apos;t trust you for more than a few years . of course you can also buy CDs and DVDs in archive quality which last longer , harder to get and much more expensive . there are offers about gold coated DVDs , &amp; dollars ; 2 the piece that claim a lifetime of 100 years .
CD / DVD discs can be un@@ readable but you can reduce this risk in which you use good disks and good recording devices and store them in the right way . the best DVD recording devices are not much more expensive than the cheapest , but you write a lot more reliable .
CDs and DVDs are very suscep@@ tible to errors even if they have just been written . that &apos;s why they use a control sum mechanism to protect themselves . 75 % of the data is only effective data , the rest we need for format@@ ting and control sum@@ m@@ ons . despite this massive protection they age through chemical ageing , ultra@@ violet light , scratches , dust &amp; etc ;
for faulty CDs and DVDs there is a reasonably priced program called I@@ so@@ Bu@@ ster which seems to do wonders for CDs and DVDs . it runs under Windows and &amp; Linux ; but is not yet available for Mac@@ s . there are also similar applications to read corrupted data from damaged disks , hard disks , flash media , USB drives , etc .
optical media : Blu @-@ ray Dis@@ ks seem to capture the format war against HD DVD . a dual layer Blu @-@ ray disc can store 50 GB and thus almost six times the capacity of a dual layer DVD with 8.5 GB .
slow @-@ burn with a good recording device on high @-@ quality media in a non @-@ propri@@ ated format . after that , read the media with a description , date &amp; author mark and then store on a clean , dark dry and protected site . do not forget to copy the data to the next generation of media before you can read the latest piece of hardware or software that can read these media .
disk manufacturers keep your statistics for themselves . your manufacturer &apos;s warran@@ ties include a new disk , but not the data . Google provides a large field study on the error mechanisms of hard drives : disk error study
the most common cause of failure increases dramatically . electronic parts of the controller are the most common cause of error , S@@ MA@@ RT cannot detect these errors . some of S@@ MA@@ RT permanently identify errors . the expected lifetime is between 4 and 5 years .
this is only the total loss due to over@@ voltage . of course , you can also lose data loss due to a power failure before you have secured the files , but these losses can normally be restored without major problems .
while most electrical devices do not make much of electric sho@@ cks , this can cause severe damage to devices with computer chips and high @-@ speed processors . these anom@@ ali@@ es can cause serious damage . on your computer , these anom@@ ali@@ es can cause persistent key@@ boards , complete data loss , hardware ageing , destroyed mother@@ boards and other defects .
the most widespread protection against current peaks is an over@@ voltage protection . this is a device that absor@@ bs some of the energy heat and gro@@ unded the rest . it is usually available in the form of a connector bar . but remember that not every connector bar also contains over@@ voltage protection .
if you are looking for an over@@ voltage protection , make sure that it complies with UL 14@@ 49 standard , which guarantees a certain minimum of protection . you should also take care that it provides protection against lightning strikes and thus protects the properly connected devices .
since an over@@ voltage of any cable can be used to your computer , you should make sure that all peripheral devices connected to your system are protected . some manufacturers provide over@@ voltage protection , which also includes a telephone connection for your modem . others offer connection options for the co@@ axial cable of the cable modem and the TV card .
if you have a laptop , then you will need a portable over@@ voltage protection . a variety of these devices are specially developed for not@@ ebooks and therefore very small and they also contain the protection for the modem .
while an over@@ voltage protection protects your system from minor fluctuations in the power lines it will not really help you in a complete failure . even a failure of a few seconds can lead to the loss of irre@@ plac@@ eable data . it can therefore be useful to invest in a un@@ interrupted power supply .
in addition to protecting against sur@@ ge vol@@ tages , these devices can automatically provide battery energy when a power failure occurs . some models allow you to save your data and run the system ordered . if you purchase a UPS then you should be sure that they meet the same quality requirements as over@@ voltage protection . furthermore , the lifetime of the battery and the supplied software is interesting .
consider the potential risk your computer system is exposed to and compare your safety in case of current disrup@@ tions with the cost of avoiding them . a high @-@ quality over@@ voltage protection can cost you up to 50 euro ; 20 . this is only a small price difference if you consider how well your computer is protected .
the Amazon Web Service includes S3 - Simple Storage Service - a simple storage service . with the right configuration , you can mount it as a drive under &amp; Linux ; , Mac , and Windows . this allows you to use this as a backup destination for your software .
you are at home in comparison to the hard drives at home , however , very expensive - 40 GB costs &amp; dollars ; 75 per year and 400 GB cost &amp; dollars ; 500 . in addition , you need to send the data about the comparatively slow internet .
the solutions are therefore only suitable as a solution against a local data loss of the most important images . this is not a bad solution , but it is not a general backup solution .
Pic@@ as@@ a@@ web ( Google ) , Fli@@ ck@@ r ( Yahoo ) and the photo community 23@@ h@@ q@@ .com provide online storage services that are available on photos . their free memory is limited to 1 GB and you will not want to have your pictures in full resolution online . the professional version provides you more available in case of Fli@@ ck@@ r . for $ 25 per year you get unlimited memory , which should be checked in reality first .
from the point of view of the data backup , the web solutions are very safe . thanks to the TCP protocol , transmission errors are automatically cleaned up and included in the large companies in the offer a backup and a distributed memory . thus , they are safe .
the diagram illustrates the elements of the transmission chain in the computer . all transfers are suscep@@ tible to transmission errors . the file system Z@@ FS and b@@ tr@@ fs ensure at least the data integrity between the operating system and the hard disk .
the worst thing about this is that nobody tells you when a transmission error occurred , not when this happened in your hardware . all these disturbances remain und@@ et@@ ected until you have one day to open a photo and this is destroyed to your surprise . no one seems to have thought about it . the Internet with its TCP protocol is a much more secure data path than the one in your computer .
un@@ reliable power supplies are another source of transmission losses because they generate inter@@ ferences in the data streams . in normal file systems , these errors remain un@@ noticed .
even if you are not particularly affected by transmission problems , you should look into the future . as early as 2010 , you will see thousands of errors per year .
Z@@ FS of Sun Micro@@ systems seems to be one of two candidates that can handle plate errors at a low level and are highly scalable . it is open source , with many patents and is available under a GP@@ L in@@ compatible license for Solaris and Leopard . we can only hope that it will soon also be available for &amp; Linux ; and Windows .
Oracle has launched an own initiative with its b@@ tr@@ fs fil@@ esystem . it is still in alpha status . it uses the same protection mechanisms that Z@@ FS uses and is also available for &amp; Linux ; but it is not part of the kernel yet .
do not under@@ estimate this ! these two factors are responsible for 86 % of the data loss in the not@@ ebook and 46 % in the workplace systems . for not@@ ebooks , the share of th@@ ef@@ ts is 50 % .
data loss due to viruses is less common than most people think . it leads to less damage than for example theft or new installations . and it is currently limited to Microsoft systems ; Apple users only know very few viruses and under &amp; Linux ; has long been seen no more .
open source file systems are less prone to data loss than proprietary systems : wrong , NT@@ FS is minimal better than ext@@ 3 , Reiser@@ FS , J@@ F@@ s and X@@ FS to name the most common file systems .
journ@@ aling file systems prevent corrupted data and data loss : incorrect , only the speed of the investigation process during a sudden interruption during surgery is higher and an un@@ defined status is avoided . however , if a file was not stored completely before the problem occurred , it is lost .
viruses are the greatest threat to digital data : false , theft and human errors are the main causes of data loss .
sensors from digital cameras are 1 @-@ 2 stop settings from fundamental physical limitations . it means that while the technology is further developed there is a natural limit for this progress . sensitivity and noise characteristics for all types of light sensors are not far away from this limit .
today &apos;s cameras are moving towards the 10 meg@@ apixel range . even if this resolution is too high for compact cameras and the end result is worse . even DS@@ LR cameras have your limit at 10 @-@ 12 meg@@ api@@ x@@ els . for higher resolutions , you need a full @-@ format sensor ( 24@@ x@@ 36@@ mm ) or larger formats .
a 7@@ 50@@ GB hard drive is available today for 100 &amp; euro ; so don &apos;t make anybody responsible for data loss . 6 % of all PCs are affected by a data loss every year . so secure your data after a plan and test this backup before you make any dangerous as the re@@ installation of your operating system , replacement of disks or the size change of hard drives .
suppose you make your backup daily on an external SATA drive . if , then one day , a flash will hit you lucky if the drive was not connected at the moment .
a disaster strikes locally and destro@@ ys a lot . forget aer@@ op@@ lanes : fire , water , electricity , children and th@@ ef@@ ts are dangerous enough for your data . they usually affect a whole room or the entire house .
therefore , disaster prepar@@ edness always means a non @-@ local storage . bring your back@@ ups up the stairs , to the adjacent house , to your office or something similar .
there is another advantage of physical separation : as mentioned above is a common cause for data loss despite backup the panic . if you have a backup which is not immediately available , then you can save it one day .
complete backup : a complete backup of all files to be backed up . it is a snapshot without history and represents a complete copy at a time .
differential lock : a backup of the files that have been changed since the last complete backup . generates a complete snapshot at two points : the complete backup and the last differential lock .
incre@@ mental backup : a backup of the files that have been changed since the last backup . creates multiple snap@@ shots . you can restore the original status at any time in which such a backup has been made . this backup comes closest to a version@@ ing system except that it is only scanned and not continuous .
r@@ sync is a wonderful small tool that you can easily set up on your machines . unlike scrip@@ ted FTP sessions or other types of file transfer scripts r@@ sync copies only the difference of files that have really been changed . this happens compressed and if you want to increase security via s@@ sh .
backup important images directly after you have saved them on your computer to a DVD or another optical media .
this procedure allows you enough time to detect and restore lost . at the same time , you will get a complete daily version of the last 7 @-@ 14 days , a weekly snapshot for at least one month and a snapshot for each month . any further di@@ lution should be done manually after you have made a complete review .
topics : metadata in the image file stored IP@@ TC information , associated X@@ MP files , retained original , memory , scal@@ ability , media , re@@ inv@@ enting images and metadata , copying images to the next generation of media , applications , operating systems , virtualization , visual equipment , ... , use of the Internet .
so that valuable pictures will survive the next 40 years , that is approximately the period in which you really are interested in you because they remind you of your childhood or youth , there are two strategies that should be considered :
as the future is un@@ predictable due to your nature , you need to consider and re @-@ evaluate everything that is today . unfortunately , there is no other way than to for@@ ge a certain vi@@ gil@@ ance . every 5 @-@ 8 years you should ask yourself how the current system is backwards compatible . the less variants you have used in the past , the easier it is to evaluate the questions of the future .
this question should actually be answered by the explanations in this document . use or change to open standards supported by many applications .
virtualization is available for everyone nowadays . so if you have an old system that is important to read your images , then keep it and install it in a virtual machine for later use .
on the other hand , the advice is quite simple : every@@ time you change your computer architecture , your memory and f@@ uses , or your file format , you should check your library and if necessary convert to a newer standard . stay with open standards .
scal@@ ability is the printing print for the ability to change a system in its size . this actually means increasing .
let &apos;s assume that you have planned the scal@@ ability with you and the area you want to enlarge on a dedicated disk or partition . with * nix systems like &amp; Linux ; you can copy this area and shift it to a new disk :
check with the command d@@ mes@@ g if your new disk has been detected by the system , but do not hang it .
/ dev / s@@ db &#91; # &#93; of = / dev / s@@ db &#91; # &#93; of = / dev / s@@ d@@ c # source is / dev / s@@ d@@ c / dollar ; par@@ ted res@@ ize / dev / s@@ d@@ c # source is / dev / s@@ d@@ c # source ; res@@ iz@@ e@@ 2@@ fs / dev / sad@@ c@@ 1 # change the res@@ iz@@ e@@ 2@@ fs / dev / s@@ d@@ c # source file size if necessary
open source standards have the great advantage of an open specification . even if one day no software can read it , then you can create it yourself .
GIF is a proprietary , patented format that slowly disappears from the market , so you shouldn &apos;t use it any more .
PNG has been developed as an open source standard which should replace GIF . it can save much more . it is loss@@ less , supports X@@ MP , Ex@@ in@@ f and IP@@ TC metadata , 16 @-@ bit per color channel and full transparency . the disadvantage is that it requires relative many administrative information , but not as many as TIFF and a slow compression .
TIFF was widely distributed as image format . TIFF can be stored in un@@ compressed form or in a container with loss@@ less compression algorithm ( default ) . with some cameras you can save your images in this format . however , a problem is that this format has been adapted by many people . there are therefore more than 50 different types and not all applications can work with all types .
D@@ NG The Digital Neg@@ ative File Format is a ro@@ yalty @-@ free and open shell format developed by Adobe Systems . D@@ NG has been developed on the basis of the need to uni@@ fy the camera data formats . it is based on the TIFF / EP format and is committed to the use of metadata .
this is possibly one of the reasons why , around 2001 , Adobe &apos;s XML @-@ based X@@ MP technology has introduced to replace the &amp; quot ; Image Resource block quot ; technology of the 90@@ s . X@@ MP stands for &amp; quot ; Exten@@ sible Metad@@ ata Plat@@ form@@ quot ; , a mixture of XML and R@@ DF . file information is stored by extension &amp; quot ; .x@@ mp@@ quot ; which stands for XML / R@@ DF .
many photographers prefer to archive an original of your recording , mostly in the raw format , to archive . X@@ MP also fits because it stores the metadata separately from the image file . however , it can cause problems when linking the metadata file and the image file , and as mentioned above , you should consider whether you use D@@ NG as a container and put everything together there .
the Dublin Core Metad@@ ata Initiative is an open organization dedicated to fully compatible online metadata standards that support a wide range of applications and business models . D@@ C@@ MI &apos;s activities include architecture and modeling , discussions and collaborative work in the D@@ C@@ MI communities , annual conferences and workshops , standard connections and enligh@@ tening efforts to achieve a wide acceptance of metadata standards and practices .
import images from the camera , the card reader or the scanner . as long as the images are on the camera screen , you can use this as temporary security .
convert raw files to D@@ NG and save them to your raw archive . this function is not yet implemented .
you can use external programs for fine editing . if you re @-@ edit the images again , then you should add the metadata again . these were sometimes cut off by other programs .
protect the copy@@ righ@@ ted images for the copyright with a digital water@@ mark . only export them to web galleries , code in MPEG , use in contact sheets , print etc ;
the camera interface is not the only way to get your photos in &amp; digi@@ kam ; in the Adding One Photo to an album you will find a description of how to add photos you already have on your hard disk . however , the camera interface provides you many advanced settings for im@@ porting images to your legacy database .
to use your digital camera with &amp; digi@@ com ; to use , connect it to the computer , switch the camera to the display mode and turn it on . a further description can be found in the manual of your camera .
when you start the camera interface , it will try to connect to your camera . if the connection is made , a finished indicator appears at the bottom end and the thumb@@ nails of all photos on the camera are displayed . some cameras do not display thumb@@ nails . if this is the case , the file names and a symbol for the application will be displayed on the camera .
before downloading the photos on your computer , you may need the camera information for each entry . with the features and metadata from the camera interface , you can see the properties of an entry or its metadata .
this dialog displays file properties and the photo information stored internally by the camera . a symbol indicates that the image has not yet been downloaded to your computer . note that some digital cameras do not have all the information available .
the tab Metad@@ ata shows the internal metadata such as Ex@@ if , Manufacturer re@@ mark , GPS , etc. of the image . this information is the same as in the metadata side@@ bar from the main window of &amp; digi@@ kam ; or image processing . note that this metadata is not available in some digital cameras .
the easiest way to download photos on your computer is the click on the button to download and then download the selection from all . this downloads all photos from their camera into a single album in &amp; digi@@ kam . downloading the photos will not be deleted and we recommend you to check if the pictures were safely downloaded into an album before you delete the photos from the camera .
if you do not want to download all the photos , you can only select the desired ones with the standard selection methods of &amp; k@@ de ; as soon as you have selected the photos , use the Download button and then download Sel@@ ected . download the Sel@@ ected button until you have selected some photos .
if your camera supports this , an option New download is available . these images have not been downloaded from &amp; digi@@ kam so far . in this case , the new images are marked with a star in the preview window . if you select this option , of course only the new images will be downloaded .
when you download or download the selected albums , a dialog will appear where you can select the target album in which the photos are stored . the list of existing albums will be shown , as usual folders . then , select the folder list from the list and press OK .
after selecting the target album , press OK , and &amp; Edit ; load the photos from the camera to the album .
once you have downloaded the desired photos , you can delete them from the camera . you can delete all of them at once by using the Del@@ ete Del@@ ete button . if you want to delete only a few , you have to select them first and use Del@@ ete Del@@ ete .
please note that there is no way to restore photos that you have deleted from the camera . the photos will not be moved to the folder from &amp; k@@ de ; they will be deleted completely . you should check carefully if the photos were successfully deleted in a &amp; digi@@ plug , before you delete them from the camera . if you want to completely er@@ ase the camera finder , you should do so using the camera menu , as this is much faster .
cameras use as fil@@ en@@ ames for the photos often not particularly meaningful names . the file names are usually re@@ used after the photos are deleted from the camera . this can lead to double fil@@ en@@ ames in case you upload photos from different shooting sets into the same album . therefore , it may be useful to integrate the date and time on which the image has been made into the file name .
in the next section , you will find options for rotating and mirr@@ oring the image and for date @-@ based sub@@ directories . if you use this latter option , you will automatically create a folder per day .
the options during the transfer will open three more options that will be performed before the photos are stored on the disk . the first two affect the information about the author in the standard car identity section . if you select this , the corresponding entries are copied from the Ex@@ if information into the IP@@ TC fields . with the last option you can correct date &amp; time for all downloaded images .
for example , if you want another date format than the standard format , you can use the pre@@ fix photo % % % M : % M : % M : % M : % S . turn on the date &amp; time option . for further custom@@ ization , you should read the help of the str@@ f@@ time command .
if you use the option camera fil@@ en@@ ames , you have the option to change the file names in lower case letters when you download . or lower case letters if you prefer this .
the new fil@@ en@@ ame , which &amp; digi@@ kam ; uses for a photo , is displayed below the name that the camera provides in the preview . your settings for ren@@ aming will be saved and used automatically when you open the camera window next time .
&amp; digi@@ kam ; can use all information about the orientation of the camera to the time point of recording to perform an automatic rotation during download . not all cameras provide this information . in the section bar metadata you can read more details about the information that your camera embedded in the photo .
the automatic rotation is normally switched on , and if your camera does not provide this information , &amp; digi@@ kam ; the photo in the original orientation . if you want to turn off the automatic turn , use the Advanced button and select the automatic rotation at the bottom of the window .
if your camera provides information about the date on which the photo was taken , you can use it to automatically create sub @-@ albums in the target album . all images with the same date are loaded into the same sub @-@ album . not all cameras provide this information . in the section bar met@@ a data , you can check which information your camera could have embedded in the photos .
this option is normally off , and in this case saves &amp; digi@@ kam ; the photos directly in the target album . if you want to change this , you need to turn on this option . use the Advanced button and select the date @-@ based sub @-@ albums at the bottom of the window .
the easiest way to upload photos from your computer to your camera is to download . then select Upload . the file selection dialog &amp; k@@ de ; appears where you can select the files to be uploaded . you can also select more than one file with the standard &amp; k@@ de ; methods .
after the image selection is done , ask &amp; Edit ; you where the images are to be uploaded . a folder selection dialog for the camera appears . select the folder you want and press OK to start up@@ loading . the images are not deleted from your computer .
GPS ( Global Posi@@ tioning System ) is used as a generic term in this document . this means a position specified in long@@ itude and l@@ atitude and can be displayed on a map . the data can be determined by the American GPS , the Russian G@@ LO@@ NAS , the European GA@@ LI@@ LE@@ O or any other system .
not only for professional photographers could it be interesting to link a picture with a precise geographic location . not everyone uses a plane to map an area through automatic recording of the GPS data . environment planners , military , police , architecture offices and real estate agents can use this ability .
if you later forgot where exactly the photo was taken , you can open a browser that shows the area . if you want to send a postcard to another , or simply want to document the location of the photo , or just want to document this aspect , it is good to save the position data of a photo .
the question is how do the GPS data come into the picture ? first , you should know that exi@@ v2 supports many GPS data fields , such as direction , saddle and map references . there are at least three ways to achieve this . directly with the right hardware , via post @-@ processing of the GPS data and image files with the K@@ IP@@ I module for geographic mapping ( manual ) and last on manual input of known places .
as far as we know , there is currently no camera that has integrated a GPS unit . but there are a few working with GPS receivers . either as map module or by transmission of data with a cable or Bluetooth .
cameras with GPS interface : Co@@ y@@ ot@@ e@@ Eye i@@ PA@@ Q I@@ ke Ko@@ da@@ k D@@ CS Pro Nikon DS@@ LR Ri@@ co@@ h Pro G@@ 3 Sony
downloading the GPS data from a device can be done with g@@ ps@@ man or g@@ ps@@ b@@ abel . however , you must save these data in GP@@ X format , as this is the only format supported by the module for geographical mapping .
there are various programs for &amp; Windows ; and Mac OS , which can extract and cor@@ relate the data of images and from the GPS . on the following page you can do the same under &amp; Linux ; make : g@@ ps@@ Cor@@ r or g@@ ps@@ Photo
if you know the long@@ itude and l@@ atitude or other data , you can use this script , which works with the Ex@@ i@@ f@@ Tool of Phi@@ l Harv@@ ey . it uses the acci@@ dent@@ als of hair@@ y coordinates which are created e.g. by map@@ s.@@ goo@@ gle .
map@@ s.@@ goo@@ gle@@ .com does not show any European street maps . here are some European sites , at least in French , German and Spanish , showing all navigation details for Europe .
&amp; digi@@ kam ; try to give you so much control over his work procedures as possible . there are many settings that change the behavior of &amp; digi@@ kam . to access these settings , you need to choose Edit Settings ; you can switch between these by clicking on the icons on the left .
select Action can be displayed on embedded preview or editing image editing . you specify the default behavior of &amp; digi@@ kam ; specify when you click on an entry in the main view .
this page contains , as shown below , the standardi@@ zation and copyright data . these data are automatically written into the corresponding IP@@ TC data fields if the option was selected when downloading from the camera interface .
car title is a syn@@ onym for disc@@ olo@@ ur@@ imer : this field should contain the photographer &apos;s job title . these can be names such as a photographer , freelance photographer or independent , commercial photographer . as this is a more detailed description of the author &apos;s field , it must also be filled .
editor is a syn@@ onym for providers : use this field to specify the photo . this does not have to be the author if he works for a news agency like Reu@@ ters or Associated Press , then these organizations should be listed here as this is the picture of the other &amp; quot ; an@@ biet@@ a quot ; . if the image is a stock photo , then the group or agency that provides the image will be listed here .
the IP@@ TC actions store the data in the corresponding IP@@ TC ri@@ ms . this ensures that the metadata is permanently contained in the image and not only in the database of &amp; digi@@ kam ; this metadata is also available to other programs and can be imported in &amp; digi@@ ce ; imported without going lost .
save image labels as embedded cap@@ tions ( J@@ FI@@ F ) in JPEG images : this synchron@@ izes the comments you add to your photos , with the in@@ scrip@@ tions embedded in the pictures .
the Settings page contains all the information that will appear when the mouse poin@@ ter rests over a file in the main window . depending on the selected option , this information is displayed or not .
&amp; # 160 ; Edit ; supports a number of different image formats and some video and audio formats . to specify which file types &amp; digi@@ kam ; to indicate which file types &amp; digi@@ kam ; display , you can add and remove the file extensions of this list .
the default settings can be reset by pressing the Update button to the right of each category .
the settings of the lumin@@ aire by &amp; digi@@ kam ; can be set on this page to the default values . however , every time you open the lighting table these settings are switched on if possible . however , some pictures have different sizes and the synchron@@ ous mode is not available . the option &amp; quot ; In the entire image size lad@@ en@@ quot ; should you use only on fast computers . if you have one , then you can get better viewing results .
by default , image editing uses a black background behind the displayed photos . if you prefer a different color , you can select it here . you can turn off the toolbar if you use image processing in full screen mode .
over@@ - and under@@ exposed areas of an image can be marked with dark or light color in the image . these colors are defined here . in image processing this View Mode with F@@ 10 and F@@ 11 can be switched on and off .
chro@@ ma @-@ Sub@@ sampling means that the images are enco@@ ded in higher resolution of lumin@@ ance than in colour information . please read this article in Wikipedia for more details .
with the PNG comp@@ ressing setting , you can reduce the size of PNG files . this operation does not reduce image quality since PNG is using a loss@@ less algorithm . the only effect is that the image data requires more time to un@@ pack and un@@ pack . if you have a fast computer , you can set this value to a high compression .
with the option to comp@@ ress TIFF files , you can turn the default compression algorithm for TIFF images . this reduces the size of the TIFF images . it has no influence on image quality , since the default algorithm works loss@@ less .
with the Los@@ s@@ less JPEG 2000 files setting , you can save loss@@ less . even if you select the loss @-@ based setting , the ratio between quality loss and file size is far better than at normal JPEG . when this paragraph was written , metadata was not supported yet , but was in the planning .
in the earlier versions of &amp; digi@@ kam , image editing was only a picture viewer for photos . currently , it develops very quickly to a tool for manipul@@ ating your photos . with this dialog you can change the settings of image editing .
the standard assumption is that all green pixels are the same . if the linear green pixels of the CCD sensor react more sensitive to ultra@@ violet light than the pixels of odd lines , this difference creates a grid pattern in the output . this option distinguishes the image a bit soft , but eliminates the 2x@@ 2 grid patterns with the V@@ N@@ G@@ - or the A@@ HD quality method .
if this option is set , the white balance of the camera is used . otherwise , if set , the automatic color balance is used .
this setting is used only if the white balance is not set . default is to use a fixed color balance based on a white card that was photograph@@ ed in sunlight .
this setting is only supported for Fu@@ ji Super CCD S@@ LR cameras . using the second sensor has the effect that under@@ exposed images get more details in the top lights in four steps . this option is ignored for other cameras .
the default is it &apos;s the pointed lights , so the parts of your images are burned , due to the inability of your camera to catch the top lights , as a passing white . the setting colors will generate some unusual results as they display the pointed lights in various ros@@ at@@ ables .
this is possible because blue pixels in general are not as fast @-@ filled as green and red . &amp; digi@@ kam ; and d@@ cra@@ w therefore try to re@@ construct the missing green and red portions from the still un@@ saturated blue pixels . of course , this is a question of how much color or white you want .
if you select the option re@@ constructing , you get the possibility to set a level . here , a value of three is a compromise and / should therefore be adapted individually for each image .
set the lumin@@ ance value according to your taste . you probably need to set it slightly higher than the standard 1 . however , this can also later be done in the &amp; digi@@ kam screen options ; to keep the time for the Dem@@ os@@ a@@ icing small , you should proceed conserv@@ atively .
a Dem@@ os@@ a@@ icing algorithm is a digital image process to calculate a complete picture of the raw data , which come from the color filtered image sensor , which has many cameras and which provides a matrix of coloured pixels . this algorithm is also known as C@@ FA inter@@ pol@@ ation or colour design .
and D@@ cra@@ w provides you three alternatives : bil@@ ine@@ ar , V@@ NG Inter@@ pol@@ ation and A@@ HD Inter@@ pol@@ ation . after some tests , it looks like A@@ HD Inter@@ pol@@ ation ( for Adap@@ tive Hom@@ ogen@@ ic Direc@@ ted ) was the first algorithm used by D@@ cra@@ w .
if you know the color deviation of your lenses you can set the red and blue correction values here . this is certainly the best method for color correction since it is performed during the raw conversion .
a profile transl@@ ates the color information and gives instructions how to be given again . there are also L@@ CMS and &amp; digi@@ kam ; information how to translate color information from a color space to the other , so that the colors are as accurate as possible .
behavior Questions when an image is opened in image editing / Color management module start with raw files .
color Profile Fol@@ der Sets the folder , such as / usr / share / color / ICC or / home / user / .@@ color / ICC , where you can save all your profiles .
settings of ICC profiles you have here the option &amp; quot ; default resource ; for your profiles to deposit . everything can be changed when opening the raw file later .
the color management view is an alternative to X@@ cali@@ b or Ar@@ gy@@ ll . here are only your pictures colored not the entire screen .
not all profiles are created in the same way . there are some , such as Canon , which do not contain color @-@ mapping or g@@ amma correction . currently , d@@ cra@@ w G@@ amma does not correct for conver@@ sions at 16 bit depth . this means that you have to do the color mapping itself .
there are other options such as the Soft Pro@@ of profile that you can em@@ ulate on how your image can be restored from one device . this is very useful before you print image , since your printer has a smaller color area than your camera and some colors can therefore be very saturated . this could be manually correct instead of rel@@ ying on the blind algorithm of your printer .
for most cameras , it is quite obvious which color profile is intended for what is intended for . unfortunately , not in the models of Canon . hence , here follows a table of cameras and profiles that fit together . this answer is of course un@@ official :
the Canon profile extension makes it possible to recognise the style for the goal : F for a precise style , L for landscapes , N for neutral , P for portrait and S for standard style .
K@@ IP@@ I is the &amp; k@@ de ; Image Plugin interface . it is an interface that is supported by a number of &amp; k@@ de ; image viewers and image editing . by providing this interface can support &amp; digi@@ kam ; many modules that have been written to work with any program that supports the K@@ IP@@ I interface .
if your distribution has the K@@ IP@@ I modules installed , you will see a list of available modules . select the modules you want to use , and these will be loaded by &amp; Edit ; these modules appear as new entries in the main window menu and in addition , you will find some also in the context menu of the preview .
short@@ cuts for tasks performed by modules can be set in the menu under Settings short commands .
for more information ( in English ) about K@@ IP@@ I modules , please visit the K@@ IP@@ I project at ht@@ t@@ p : / / www.@@ ki@@ pi @-@ plug@@ ins@@ .org or in the manuals of the K@@ IP@@ I modules .
the settings of the slide show should be easy to understand . the upper knob adju@@ sts the time between the image transitions , usually 4 @-@ 5 seconds . the other check boxes switch the metadata on or off , which are displayed at the bottom end of the images during the ad .
the camera features on the left show a list of all the currently supported cameras . on the right hand side there is a button Automatic detection , which tries to identify a camera connected to the computer . if you want to use this , make sure that the camera is properly connected , switched on and in the image display mode . currently , serial , USB and USB / Fire@@ Wire mass storage is supported .
at the bottom , you can set the path for USB and Fire@@ Wire ( I@@ EE@@ E @-@ 13@@ 94 or i @-@ Link ) mass storage cameras . this field is only active if you have selected a USB or Fire@@ Wire mass storage camera from the camera list . you must specify the path , / m@@ nt / camera or / m@@ nt / re@@ ov@@ able , on which you mount your camera .
to use your digital camera with &amp; digi@@ com ; to use , you need to connect the camera to your computer , bring them to the display mode and turn on .
check out if &amp; Edit ; the camera automatically detects . if not , you can set camera model and port manually . after you set up your camera , your camera will appear in the camera menu .
you can select any name for your camera . it will be displayed in the main window of the main window . if you have more than one camera , you can insert all of them here .
with the option confirmation dialog for moving pictures in the folder , you can set the conversation by &amp; digi@@ kam ; you can set the photos in an album when del@@ eting a photo . you will find more details in the del@@ eting of a photo and del@@ eting an album .
the editorial changes due to the right side@@ bar can be used tac@@ itly by &amp; Edit ; apply if you use the option to apply changes in the right side@@ bar without any queries . otherwise , you need to save the changes using the button changes .
you can also disable the display of the welcome screen of &amp; digi@@ kam ; under certain circumstances , this speeds up the start process from &amp; digi@@ kam ; .
the setting At start looking for new photos forced &amp; digi@@ kam ; choose the base folder for new or deleted albums / photos . this length@@ ens the start time of &amp; digi@@ kam ; if something has been deleted from the base folder , ask &amp; Edit ; you want it to delete it from the database .
different color schemes can be used in &amp; Edit ; to customize the main window to your taste . these settings can be selected in Settings Design from the Tool@@ bar . a preview of the available designs will be listed below :
these designs have been defined in plain text files . if you are interested in creating a new design for &amp; digi@@ kam ; to create , you will find more information about this in this tutorial .
you can use these to view and edit your photos and to edit and improve . image editing can be started by clicking with the left mouse button on the preview of an image or by the context menu of preview and selection of entry / edit .
image editing includes a set of tools to improve your images . some of these are available as modules in &amp; digi@@ kam ; so you may not be part of your distribution . you can find more information about the K@@ IP@@ I modules in the image editing section .
a status bar at the bottom of the window , the fil@@ en@@ ame , current file number , magni@@ fication factor and the current image size .
a menu bar on the top and below the toolbar for quick access to the most frequently needed functions .
the editing functions of image editing change your photos . however , none of the functions will change the original photo before saving file Save or button Save from the toolbar . note that you can no longer restore the original photo once you have saved the image .
you might need to make a copy of your image before you change it . this can be done with File Save as .
as long as you have not saved the photo , you can restore the original image by re@@ covering from the File menu or using the button Res@@ ize the image processing in the toolbar . you then lose any change you have done in the photo since last saving .
almost every action in image editing can be und@@ one or restored . the last action can be revers@@ ed by editing or restoring Edit Res@@ ize from the menu .
if you use this frequently , you should do the keyboard short@@ cut , C@@ trl ; -@@ Z to und@@ o and C@@ trl ; -@@ Turn @-@ Z to restore .
if you press the &amp; L@@ MB ; pressing the rever@@ t or restore button in the toolbar at a moment , you will get a context menu . if you select one of the menu entries , all actions in between will be revers@@ ed or restored .
once you have started editing , you can move between the photos in the same album or keyword by using the navigation buttons in the toolbar , image high , image down or the entries in the File menu . if you have made changes to the current photo , you will be asked if you want to save them .
you can enter and zoom in the photo in which you use C@@ trl ; mouse wheel or the icons in the toolbar or the entries in the View menu .
to customize a photo to the window size , you can use this button in the toolbar : select the magni@@ fication factor automatically
view Full Screen mode displays the photo in full screen mode . you come into the normal view where you use the Es@@ c key . normally , you can change this in the Edit Settings dialog . you can change it from the Edit &amp; Create window ; see the section to set up image editing .
if you want to print the current picture , you can select the picture in the File menu and get the standard &amp; k@@ de ; print dialog . you can customize the settings here before printing your photo .
from the Main Menu , you can print single images or whole sets . whole picture templates can be printed from your selection . you only need to select the images using the standard methods and select Print Assistant from the Album Export menu . if you follow the wizard , you just need to make your choice .
the main window has a side@@ bar on the right , which provides important information and actions for the selected images . the same page bar is available , without the navigation file , also in image editing . it is displayed when one of the five riders is cli@@ cked :
multiple clicking on the same tab causes the side@@ bar to appear or disappear again .
the text is U@@ TF @-@ 8 compatible . this means that all special characters are allowed . the labels are copied into the EX@@ IF@@ - and IP@@ TC fields so that you can be used by other programs .
the IP@@ TC data only support ASCII characters and are limited to 2000 characters . all comments are truncated after 2000 characters and special characters are de@@ formed . if you want to use the IP@@ TC labelling field in other applications , you should consider these limitations .
after you have commented it , use either the button Apply or simply switch to the next image , the cap@@ tions are then saved .
in addition to the application button , you can read more metadata from the selected file or the database . however , you can also write the metadata into the files . however , this is always performed when you have selected a metadata setting that is always written into the images .
the review section shows a rating scheme from 0 to 5 stars and can be used in search and sort . it can be applied either with a single mouse click on the 5 stars in the side@@ bar or using the keyboard short@@ cut C@@ trl + 0 ... 5 . to evaluate multiple images simultaneously , select them and use the context menu .
the rating is written in the IP@@ TC field . the code follows the schema in the following table :
the keyword list shows a search box for filtering the keywords , the keyword tree and a selection box with the keywords used previously in this &amp; digi@@ com ; session .
the keyword tree is dynamically adapted to the entered search word . thus , you can quickly restrict the number of options when searching for a keyword . this capability is particularly useful when you have a lot of keywords .
the input field at the bottom is a further simpli@@ fication when entering keywords in a picture series . if you have typ@@ ed different keywords , they will be saved for quick access .
keywords can also be set by selecting the corresponding check boxes in the tree . all key words of an image are stored in the IP@@ TC field keyword .
if multiple images are selected in the main screen and you select a keyword in the keyword tree , this will only be applied to the highlighted image and not the entire selection , if you want to add a selection with a keyword , please read the keyword Filter section .
the keyword Filter column is used to change the selection of images displayed in the main window . normally , the left side bar with their album , date , keyword and search views is used . if additionally one or more keyword filters are used from the right @-@ hand side , only the intersection of these two is displayed . all generated keywords are available .
you can also drag and drop keywords . suppose you have selected several images in the main view to add keywords . if the keyword already exists , you can simply drag it from the right side@@ bar and place it on the selection .
in the example above , the main window displays the images on a calendar day . the keyword filter is set to No keywords , which reduces the amount to three images . they were selected with C@@ trl + a , and then a keyword was drawn from the right keyword tree to the selection and stored there . a dialog asks whether this keyword is to be set .
this search for changes takes place at every start of the program . it can also be switched off among Settings Various .
if you have a rule with and created , and find that it would be one or more , you can easily change this by double @-@ clicking on the text and in the rule area .
( 1 ) : the entry in which the database is searched . this can be an album , name , keyword , image , keyword , etc .
( 3 ) : the argument for the operator which is a name or string that is already set in the database .
you can , for example , specify an extended search for all elements of the database with the following options :
if you want to group options , you only need to use the check box at the end of the rule and then the button group@@ ing . the options then look like this :

this article / tutorial was mainly written by El@@ le Stone . special thanks to El@@ le for this work . I mainly applied it to &amp; digi@@ kam ; s specific implementation .
the reason why you use a color @-@ managed workflow is that the colors that come from your camera or scanner will have a predictable deviation from the actually photograph@@ ed or scanned colors . with a color @-@ managed workflow , you can achieve that the colors on your monitor match those of your camera or scanner and that match the colors you print or publish on the web to those from your digital dark@@ room .
when the theme comes to color management , everyone wants to know which buttons he has to press for the results he wants . unfortunately , color management means that you make informed decisions at every point of the image processing workflow . the purpose of this tutorial is to provide you with adequate background information about color management .
if your image workflow satis@@ fies all six criteria listed below , you don &apos;t have to worry about color management .
you work on a monitor that is calibr@@ ated to the s@@ RGB colour space . ( see below for more information )
their only other image expenses are via e @-@ mail or the web where s@@ RGB is the de facto standard .
so if s@@ RGB works so well and makes life so easy for everyone , why should you use another color space and then have to think about color loss ?
a visual example of limitation of s@@ RGB compared to the colors we can really see is presented below . it shows a 2 @-@ dimensional representation of all colors we can see , the hor@@ ses@@ ho@@ e @-@ shaped region , and the colors in s@@ RGB color space , the tri@@ angular region .
if you want to compare the 2 @-@ dimensional representation of s@@ RGB with some bigger color spaces , visit Bruce Lind@@ blo@@ om &apos;s excellent site and click info and then on Information About RGB Working Sp@@ aces .
do I have to c@@ alli@@ ate my monitor when I decided to work only in s@@ RGB color space ?
yes ! whether you work in s@@ RGB colour space or not , you need to sound your monitor since s@@ RGB is that your ; on@@ it@@ or is on s@@ RGB . if you work as a color space of s@@ RGB then you must either sound your monitor on the s@@ RGB standard , use a matching monitor profile or both .

this tool provides five automatic corrections , which can improve a picture in most cases . therefore , before proceeding further manual editing , use it .
the functions Norm@@ alize , Comp@@ are , Automatic Rem@@ oves and Con@@ trast extend from the correc@@ ting Auto Cor@@ rection attempt automatically to make the best from your colors . you will have to experiment with these effects to see which works best in your photo .
norm@@ alize : this method sc@@ aling the brightness values over the entire image so that the dark@@ est point is black and the brigh@@ test point is as bright as possible without changing its color shade . this function is often a magic correc@@ ting for images that are dark or out @-@ washed .
balance : this method adju@@ sts the intensity channel of the selected image so that the hist@@ ogram of the intensity channel becomes as flat as possible . sometimes the comparison results in very good results with the improvement of the contrast of an image , sometimes it also produces rub@@ b@@ ish . it is a very powerful operation that either causes miracles in an image or destro@@ ys it .
automatic balance : this method maxim@@ izes the colour range in the red , green and blue channel . it determines the dark and light border tones and adju@@ sts the red , green and blue channels to the entire history of the history .
contrast enhancement : this method enhances the contrast and illumin@@ ance of the RGB values of an image by shifting the lowest and highest values to the greatest possible area and a re @-@ ji@@ us@@ hing of all values in @-@ between . this is only visible with selected images and can be a good correction for bad photos .
the white balance by &amp; digi@@ kam ; is a semi @-@ automatic tool to perform the white balance of a photo .
the white balance correction is slightly limited as you work with 8 bits per color . so if you are too far from the original image , areas with over@@ exposure may occur . if you can perform the white balance in raw mode , which works in 16 @-@ bit mode , your possibilities for correction will be better .
this tool is based on a white balance algorithm protected by Pa@@ wel T. J@@ och@@ ym . you start it via the menu entry color white balance of image processing .
the preview window can be adjusted in size . on the left side you can see both the original image and preview of the target image . preview will dynamically adjust the settings of the tool . if you want to see the original white balance again , click on the sub@@ window .
the preview of the target image has a red marker . the lumin@@ ance of the pixel under this marker is displayed as a vertical line in the hist@@ ogram .
to the right , a hist@@ ogram shows that dynamically changes as soon as you change a parameter . this hist@@ ogram is very helpful , even in well lit images , most pixels have very small lumin@@ ance values . with a button you can decide whether one of the three colors or your sum is displayed .
the contrast of your result depends on shadow , satur@@ ation and g@@ amma . shadow adjustment lets you improve or even dim the shadow details of your photos .
to play An@@ stat with the above controls , you should use the color temperature pi@@ p@@ ette . click on this button and then somewhere on the image preview to use the selected color to calculate the color temperature of the white balance . this way also the temperature and green values are automatically set .
in addition , you can set the white balance with the Pre@@ ferences list . the following settings are available :
the over@@ exposure indicator increases the colors when more than one color channel of the pixel is over@@ exposed . you will get the combined result in the white balance . this is displayed in the preview as a pure indicator and has no effect on the final image .
the Save As and Load buttons make exactly this . any setting of the white balance you have set can be saved to a text file and rel@@ o@@ ad later .
the Pre@@ ferences tab returns all filter values to their default values and neutral white balance . note that even neutral settings will result in a different picture than your original . if you save this , your original image will be changed .
you can set the encoding depth per color channel of the edited image here . 8 @-@ bit encoding is the widely spread JPEG format , 16 @-@ bit encoding is better for high @-@ quality images . however , this coding requires more disk space , computing time and is only available for formats PNG , P@@ N@@ M , TIFF and D@@ NG .
this tool opens the same dialog as for the processing of color profiles . it uses the change and assignment of color profiles . color @-@ mapping can be done through the sub@@ window for the brightness . a detailed instruction for using color profiles can be used to consult the chapter color management .
another important tool is available in the color correction menu in the menu . this tool provides an integrated way to adjust several color channels simultaneously and also allows you to save your settings so that you can use them for several photos . this is useful when your camera or your scanner always make the same mistake and therefore always need the same correction .
a very powerful way to correct exposure problems is the tool for gra@@ dation that you can find in color gra@@ dation in the menu .
die &amp; digi@@ kam ; tool colour effects will provide you with four colour effects , a solar power effect , a Vel@@ via filter , a ne@@ on effect and a can@@ ister filter .
in times of chemical processing , Solar@@ isation , also called Sab@@ ati@@ er , created an effect that was replaced by a partially developed print of a short flash light and then completed the development of the image . this had the effect that the lighter areas dark@@ er and the colors were inver@@ ted by the second illumination . this tool allows you to fine @-@ adjust this interesting effect .
the intensity controls the solar radiation . at approx . 50 % intensity , the picture shows what is chem@@ ically possible . a further increase eventually creates a negative image that is not produced on photographic paper .
this is an example of the solar process effect . the original image is the ( 1 ) and that processes the ( 2 ) . the applied intensity is 30 % .
the Vi@@ vi@@ d filter simul@@ ates the so called &amp; quot ; Vel@@ vi@@ aqu@@ ot ; effect . it differs from a satur@@ ation by making it a stronger contrast effect that makes the colors brilliant and g@@ lowing .
Vel@@ via is the brand name for an in@@ verse colour film produced by the Japanese company Fu@@ ji@@ film . the name is a composition of &amp; quot ; Vel@@ vet Medi@@ aqu@@ ot ; and thus a reference for its smooth image structure . Vel@@ via offers very saturated color in daylight and high contrasts . the characteristics make him the film of choice for nature photographers . Vel@@ via &apos;s strongly saturated colors , however , are also a lot of photographers , especially those who hardly need landscapes .
the Ne@@ on filter simul@@ ates ne@@ on light on the contrast edges . the parameter level controls the brightness of the result and the slide repe@@ ats the thickness of the ne@@ on light . for large images the filter can load the entire CPU for a moment .
digital cameras often have problems with light conditions and it is therefore not unusual that you want to correct the color contrast and brightness of the photo . you can try to experiment the different color aspects of your photo with the tools in the menu under colors . once you are satisfied with the result , use the O@@ k button and you will be applied .
if you make a photo in poor light conditions you can get the reverse problem : a too big satur@@ ation . also in this case , the tool for brightness and satur@@ ation is a good choice to reduce satur@@ ation rather than increase it . if you like the result you can confirm the changes with O@@ k .
between the complex tool gra@@ dation and simple den@@ ial / contrast / g@@ amma , the tool tone correction is based on the improvement of exposure . even if the dialogue to this tool works very complicated , you need only the range of the slide for the purpose described here . more concrete the three sli@@ ders below the hist@@ ogram .
the window contains a graph of intensity values , a hist@@ ogram , the active channel or the selected area . under the graph , three slide are cli@@ cked into them and they can be moved to change the intensity values of the image . the left side represents the dark and the right side the bright areas .
the easiest way to learn how to use it is to post@@ p@@ one the controller and take care of how the image changes .
on the right , the original and preview of the image can be viewed . preview will be updated dynamically , based on the settings of the image . the following options are available on the left @-@ hand side .
sc@@ aling : this selection box shows whether the hist@@ ogram is displayed with a linear or log@@ arith@@ mic Y axis . for images of a digital camera , linear representation is often the most useful . in pictures , the linear hist@@ ogram is dominated by a single column . in this case the log@@ arith@@ mic classification is more useful .
three controllers : the top for the dark sounds , the middle one for the bright tones and the lowest for the middle sounds , often called g@@ amma @-@ values .
the three color pin@@ pet@@ tes can be used in the preview of the original image to automatically adjust the input values of the shadows , middle and light tones . in addition , there is a button for fully automatic adjustment .
output values : the output values allow the selection of manual values for each area . there are also two controls that can be used to inter@@ actively change the output values as in the input values . the compression of the output values can be used e.g. to create a f@@ aded image as background while something else is seen in the foreground .
automatically : with this button , the image values are automatically set depending on the intensity values of the image .
save as and load : with these buttons , the set values can be saved in the file system and loaded later . for this purpose the Gim@@ p level format is used .
if you use this mode and the three color pi@@ pet@@ tes , the input values are automatically read@@ ju@@ sted for all shadows , means and sun tones . activate the color pi@@ p@@ ette you want to use and click the preview of the original image to set the input values of the hist@@ ogram for red , green , blue and the lumin@@ ance channels .
the Over@@ exposure indicator checks all color channels to find over@@ exposed pixels and show you the combined result of all channels . this is an indicator , i.e. you will get the effect only in the preview and it &apos;s no effect on the final result .
below you see an example of adjusting the input values applied to the red , green and blue channel of a photo . intensity and alpha channel , as well as the output values are unchanged . the original image is marked with ( 1 ) and the corrected image with ( 2 ) .
the left side shows half of the original and the target image . preview is dynamically updated depending on your settings . the following options are available on the right @-@ hand side :
modi@@ fier channel : this selection box allows to specify the channel that is modified by the module :
next to this box are two symbols to switch between a linear and a log@@ arith@@ mic view . for pictures taken with a digital camera , the linear mode is usually the most useful . for images with large areas of a constant color , linear mode creates a wide beam . in this case , the log@@ arith@@ mic mode will help .
for example , if you move a short part to the right , e.g. the bright tones , then you can see that these bright tones correspond to dark@@ er output tones and that the associated image pixels become dark@@ er .
if you want to move this marker to the area you want to change , a matching line is displayed on the curve representing the original value . create a point on this line and then move it up and down until the value is adjusted to your taste .
save as and load : with these buttons , you can do exactly this . every curve you have created can be saved in the file system and loaded later . the file format for this is the Gim@@ p curve format .
if you create this method and the three color pi@@ p@@ ette buttons automatically create the control points of the curve for all channels of shadow , middle and sun tones . activate the color pi@@ p@@ ette you want to use and click the original image to set the control points for the red , green , blue and lumin@@ ance curve .
the Over@@ exposure indicator checks all color channels to display over exposed pixels . if in more than one channel exposed pixels are found , you get the combined result . this is an indicator , i.e. you will get the effect only in the preview and it &apos;s no effect on the final result .
below you can see a black and white photo , which was corrected in the lumin@@ ance channel . shadow and sun tones were set with the color pi@@ p@@ ette and applied to the curves . the original image is ( 1 ) and the corrected ( 2 ) .
the channel mixer der &amp; digi@@ kam ; image processing is a tool for improving the color channels or changing the color shades of the photo .
the channel mixer is another highly developed tool to mix the colors of the images . you can edit it from the menu colors channel mixer of image processing .
with the channel selection box , you can select the color for the hist@@ ogram : this gives you a first hint as you can correct the channels by viewing the relative distribution and precip@@ itation . the left pane of the window will show you a preview . the original can be viewed for comparison with your own rider .
the preview of the target image has a red marker . if you position it in the image appears a vertical line in the hist@@ ogram to show you the corresponding color value .
controls for the module are shown on the right : controls for red , green and construction allow you to mix these channels . if you activate L@@ umin@@ ance , the image will retain the general brightness even if you change the option Mon@@ och@@ ro@@ me , since the channel mixer is then THE tool for creating great black and white conver@@ sions of your photos . try to reduce the green channel for black and white portraits .
sometimes , especially when you mix mon@@ och@@ ro@@ me , the reduction of a color leads to a visible noise that comes from the colored noise . the color is made of small noise art@@ ef@@ acts that do not appear at the same place in the color channel and whose noise pattern is different in each channel . if that is the case , you can improve your mon@@ och@@ ro@@ me conversion thereby reducing the color noise first .
the Save As and Load buttons are used exactly for this purpose . you can save any mixer setting for later and then load it . the file format used is the Gim@@ p channel mixer format .
the Over@@ exposure indicator checks all color channels to find over@@ exposed pixels and show you the combined result of all channels . this is an indicator , i.e. you will get the effect only in the preview and it &apos;s no effect on the final result .
below you can see a photo in which the blue channel has been read@@ ju@@ sted . the option L@@ umin@@ ance is enabled . the original image is under ( 1 ) and the edited image below ( 2 ) .
black / white photography has always been fascinating because of your abstra@@ ction . with the development of digital photography , black / white is a work step because color images can be easily converted to the computer . also with a set of film roll profiles .

green filter : simul@@ ates a black / white film exposure with a green l@@ enti@@ l filter . this looks good at all scene images and fits particularly well to portraits of the sky .
orange Filter : simul@@ ates a black / white film exposure with a orange line filter . this improves landscapes , maritime scenes and aerial photos .
red filter : simul@@ ates a black / white film exposure with a red lens filter . this creates dramatic cel@@ esti@@ al effects and can simulate lun@@ ar e@@ ens at the time of the day . thus , similar to the 00@@ 3 C@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) red filter .
yellow filter : simul@@ ates a black / white film exposure with a yellow lens filter . this is the most natural colour tone correction and improves the contrast . it is ideal for landscapes and thus similar to the 001 C@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) yellow filter .
S@@ cap@@ aton : creates warm light and medium tones while adding a bit of cold in the sh@@ ading tones . this is very similar to the process of the ble@@ aching of a pressure and the re@@ development in a sc@@ epi@@ at@@ oner . this is typical for the photos of your grand@@ mother and thus similar to the 00@@ 5 C@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) sc@@ epi@@ af@@ il@@ ter .
with the &amp; digi@@ kam ; apply tool texture you can apply decorative tex@@ tures to an image .
by adding a texture to your image , regardless of whether it is a color image or not , you can make it look like an oil painting on a screen , the stit@@ ch of an old master , a pop art portrait of enlarged points or like a mur@@ al on a wall .
relief : post@@ p@@ one this parameter to the right increases the appearance of the depth respectively the three @-@ dimension@@ ality of the texture on the image .
a paper text effect was applied on the photo below . the original image is ( 1 ) and the modified one below ( 2 ) . the relief parameter has been set to 200 .
with the &amp; digi@@ kam ; tool frame add a decorative frame to be added to a picture .
keeping the eye of a viewer within the limits of a photo is not an easy task . one way to keep his attention is to put the image a decorative frame . this is a psychological barrier to the sc@@ attering eye .
type : with this parameter you can set the desired frame type for your image . thoroughly , the image borders with a colored line , Ni@@ ep@@ ce surround it with a thin line and a wide frame ( ideal for black and white pictures ) , be@@ k@@ ant@@ et it with a nice three dimensional frame which is ideal for a button effect and decorative adds a decorative frame with patterns .
width : specifies the width of the frame in percent . the range of values for width is limited from 1 % to 50 % .
the finish decorated with the frame will be bigger than the original , but the same aspect ratio . this is important for printing the images , especially if you have used the tool after aspect ratio before using .
with this handy tool , you can easily insert a format@@ ted text into a picture at any place . this also goes to several places if you need it .
this tool is very intuitive to use . simply enter the text and place it with the mouse . use text direction , orientation , color from the color space and the character set with its properties as you need it . you will simply select a frame around the text and / or a semi @-@ transparent background .
any setting you have chosen for your text can be changed until you press the OK button . once the image has been saved , the text is part of the image . it can no longer be changed .
with the &amp; digi@@ kam ; tool templates apply you can place a template on a picture .
the Create menu template can be used in image processing can be used to place templates over a picture .
for the sten@@ cil there are no restrictions regarding the size and orientation . however , you need to take the PNG file format and should work with maximum compression ( 9 ) for the reduction of the file size of the template . if you want to add your template to the &amp; digi@@ com ; mail@@ ing@@ list digi@@ plug @-@ users @ k@@ de@@ .org ..
if you use this tool for the first time , you need to set your template folder to the base folder in the dialog . select the folder where you copied the template files . these settings will be scheduled for the next start .
after the root folder has been set for the templates , a tree view that reflects the folder structure of the template folder appears . selecting a folder automatically updates the template &apos;s thumb@@ nail .
there are three buttons below that you can change the magni@@ fication factor and the position of your image .
enlarge : this button magni@@ fies the underlying image . it is centered around the position of the mouse . check it with the left mouse button .
res@@ ize : this button shr@@ inks the image below . it is centered around the position of the mouse . if you want to apply the template to the whole picture , you need to reduce the image accordingly . check it with the left mouse button .
move : use this button to move the image lying under the template . to do so , take the picture and place it at the desired position .
use OK when you want to apply the template to your image . the image will then be adjusted automatically to the preview size .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are three different tools for sharpen@@ ing . each one of you has advantages in other fields . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
sharpen@@ ing is a traditional tool for sharpen@@ ing . it is very fast and easy , but creates gra@@ iny images especially in dark areas .
blur@@ ring mask works on the contrast of edges to make a picture shar@@ per . in fact it does not shar@@ pen a bit , it works rather psycho@@ visual . you can use it to remove atmospheric ha@@ ze and it makes a really good job . the algorithm has been taken out of Gim@@ p and it is copy@@ righ@@ ted by Win@@ ston Ch@@ ang .
re@@ focusing is possibly the best of the three because it really improves the sharp@@ ness . it is a little more complicated in its application and has different parameters for adjustment .
images without focus as well as most digi@@ ti@@ zed images need a correction of the sharp@@ ness . this is because the digi@@ tization process can be combined with only minimal differences at a color point . this in turn leads to sharp edges a little blur@@ red . the same phenomenon can be observed when color points are printed on paper . S@@ LR cameras usually require more subsequently sharpen@@ ing than normal cameras for private users .
images in raw format , on the other hand , must always be sharpen@@ ed during processing .
some scann@@ ers apply a field of sharp@@ ness already during the reading of the image . if you de@@ activate this , you will get control of your image .
in some situations , you can get useful results by sharpen@@ ing a photo with the sharpen@@ ing tool . this allows you to use the menu entry correc@@ tor sharpen@@ ing .
you should be careful with this because the results do not work very naturally : sharpen@@ ing increases the sharp@@ ness of the edges , but also increases the noise . in general , the most useful technique for sharpen@@ ing an image will re@@ focus the tool . you will achieve more information and a comparison of all techniques for sharpen@@ ing .
sometimes you have the opposite problem : a picture is too cra@@ cked . the solution to draw the picture a little soft is much easier than to shar@@ pen it . use the tool for sof@@ tening with the menu entry Cor@@ rec@@ ting sof@@ tness and experiment something with settings . the preview window on the right of the dialog will show you the effect on your photo .
the filter Un@@ sharp mas@@ king is a very good tool for removing veil from your photos . you can see a demonstration here .
the original image and preview help to edit the image . the preview window displays the output of the filter with the current settings .
there are two important parameters , the radius and the amount . the default values often generate good results and should be tried first . increasing the radius or the amount increases the effect .
the radius indicates how many pixels on each side of an edge are affected by the filter . high @-@ resolution images allow larger radi@@ i . therefore , you should best shar@@ pen images in their final resolution .
the amount represents the percentage between the original and the wi@@ ped image which is added to the original . thus , the strength of the sharp@@ ness is set .
the threshold value is a fraction of the maximum RGB value and the application difference amount . thus , it is possible to define a minimum difference thus for an edge of the filter . thus areas with a soft altern@@ ation between the tones are excluded from sharpen@@ ing and therefore f@@ laws in faces , sk@@ ies and water surfaces are avoided .
this is an example of the blur@@ red mask filter . the original image is the ( 1 ) and the edited image the ( 2 ) . blur@@ red mask was applied with radius = 6.0 , amount = 0.5 and a threshold value = 0.0 .
die &amp; digi@@ kam ; tool re@@ focus re@@ direc@@ ts a picture by improving the sharp@@ ness . it used the copyright protected design filter algorithm by Ernst Li@@ ppe .
this is a better approach than just trying to shar@@ pen the photo . it uses a technique called FI@@ R Wiener filtering . the traditional technique for sharpen@@ ing images is the use of a blur@@ ring mask . re@@ focusing reaches usually better results than blur@@ red . you can start it from the menu by calling color re@@ focuss@@ ing in image processing .
in practice , the circular folding works much better than the gau@@ ze &apos; cal folding . the Gau@@ ß &apos;s folding has a very long tail , which results in the mathematical result also from the source pix@@ el@@ ae that are far from the original source pixel . in most cases , the FI@@ R Wiener In@@ verse of the Gau@@ ß &apos; folding is even very strongly influenced by the remote pixels .
circular focus : this is the radius of the circular folding . it is the most important parameter for using this module . for most pictures , the default value should result in 1 good results .
correlation : an increase in correlation can help to reduce art@@ ef@@ acts . the correlation can be selected from 0 @-@ 1 . useful values are 0.5 and the values near 1 , &amp; eg ; 0,@@ 95 and 0.@@ 99 . a high value for the correlation reduces the sharp@@ ness effect of the module .
noise filter : an increase in the noise filter can help reduce arti@@ facts . however , values higher than 0.1 are rarely useful . if the noise filter is too low , eg ; 0 the image quality is very bad . a useful value is 0,@@ 03 . a high value will continue to s@@ me@@ ar the picture .
G@@ auss &apos;@@ sche sharp@@ ness : this is the radius for the sharp@@ est sharp@@ ness . use this parameter if your bl@@ ur is gau@@ ze . this is most often caused by a previously executed bl@@ ur filter . in most cases , you should use this value to 0 to avoid annoying arti@@ facts . if you use a value equal to zero , you may also need to increase the correlation and / or the noise filter .
matrix size : this value determines the size of the matrix . an increase in the size of the die can produce good results especially if you choose large values for the sharp@@ ness or sharp@@ ness of the palate . however , please note that the module will be very slow if you select large values for this parameter . in most cases , you should choose a value in the range of 3 @-@ 10 .
the Save As and Load buttons are used exactly for this purpose . any re@@ focusing parameter you have set will be saved for later and can then be loaded .
try to perform all cutting , color and intensity corrections on the image before using the module .
otherwise you should use the module before you change the image otherwise . the reason for this is that a lot of operations changes that are not immediately visible , but later leave unpleasant art@@ ef@@ acts .
when you read and comp@@ ress images , eg ; as JPEG , you should apply the module to the un@@ compressed image .
generally , un@@ sharp mas@@ king produces better results than sharpen@@ ing . this could be caused by the un@@ sharp mas@@ king of a larger neighborhood used than sharpen@@ ing .
in theory , un@@ sharp masks always need to produce art@@ ef@@ acts . even under optimal conditions it can never be the effect of the bl@@ ur . for the Wiener filter it is possible to show that it is the optimal lens filter . the FI@@ R Wiener filter is often better in processing small details .
below you can see a comparison between the different filters using a small un@@ focused image :
this picture has been made with an analog camera . the un@@ focused result is due to insufficient light for the auto focus lens .
for more information on the methods of sharp@@ ness correction in digital pictures , you can read a technical comparison in English at this address .
the smooth@@ ness regulator puts the bl@@ ur of the area that has been dark@@ ened to create a more natural pup@@ il .
the ink ink allows for a customized color for the pup@@ il . if you want blue eyes instead of dark ones , you can set it here .
the tool error correction tool is one of the most developed tools to remove un@@ desired arti@@ facts with unprecedented speed .
the In@@ painting algorithm was developed by the I@@ MA@@ GE team of the G@@ REC CN@@ RS laboratory in Ca@@ en / France and is part of the C@@ Im@@ g project .
this tool contains different pres@@ ets as starting points to simplify the restoration process . the available default settings are listed below :
if you want to fine @-@ tune the filter settings , you can use the Ri@@ fl@@ es and Advanced Settings tabs .
details p &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this controls the maintenance of the details . a small value leads to an even smooth@@ ness over the image . a value of 0.@@ 9 should be kept in detail in such a way that no sharpen@@ ing is necessary subsequently .
directional dependence of Alpha &#91; 0,@@ 100 &#93; : a small value smooth@@ es evenly in all directions , while a value close to 1 smooth@@ es only in one direction . if you have a film grain or CCD noise will produce a high value shaft @-@ like pattern . JPEG Art@@ ef@@ acts are best removed at a value near 1 .
smooth &#91; 0 , 500 &#93; : this sets the maximum smo@@ othing effect via all@@ . p then defines the relative smo@@ othing . therefore , set this value appropriate to the degree of noise in your image .
regul@@ arity : &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this parameter affects larger structures . the higher this value is set , the more is smooth@@ ed . this is necessary if there is a lot of noise as it is then difficult to estimate the geometry of the image . even if you want to create a &apos; van Go@@ gh &apos; turbul@@ ence effect it must be set higher than 3 .
repeti@@ tions : specifies how often the algorithm passes through . usually 1 or 2 is sufficient .
angle of angle da &#91; 5 , 90 &#93; : angle @-@ dependent integration of the an@@ is@@ otrop@@ ic Alpha . if alpha is selected small , it should also be small . make sure that small angles create a long term . so you should choose this value as much as possible and acceptable for your needs .
integral step width &#91; 0,1 , 10 &#93; : integral step width in pixels . you should set the value smaller 1 to avoid sub @-@ pixel smo@@ othing and never exceed 2 .
use linear inter@@ pol@@ ation : the more quality you receive by selecting this option is minimal , but it dou@@ bles the runtime . we therefore recommend it to om@@ it it .
the Save As and Load buttons make exactly this . any setting of image errors can be corrected in a text file and loaded later .
correc@@ ting image errors is comparatively very fast when working . nevertheless , it can take a long time and pull a high CPU load . you can therefore cancel the calculation at any time using the Cancel button .
below you can see how image errors are corrected with small art@@ ef@@ acts . the module is applied on a photo that was made in Guatemala City with an analog camera . as you can see , there is a strange black art@@ ef@@ act in the foreground that caused by a bad movie storage during the trip . the original picture is below ( 1 ) and the corrected picture below ( 2 ) .
die &amp; digi@@ kam ; noise reduction is a powerful tool to reduce noise . it uses a copy@@ righ@@ ted algorithm by Peter Heck@@ ert .
this tool provides selectable image filters to remove stain@@ s and other art@@ ef@@ acts that come from dust or hair on the lens . it can also be used to remove sensor noise from the camera or Mo@@ i@@ re@@ acute ; effects of scanned images from books or magazines .
if you need more information about digital cameras sensor noise , you can read them in English in this tutorial .
the screen@@ shot above shows a typical scene made with a digital camera and a high ISO sensitivity . it shows a gra@@ iny noise that can be successfully removed with this tool .
in the following you will find a complete description of all parameters . in most cases , you only need the sub @-@ window details and the Advanced Settings sub@@ window can remain with the default settings .
radius controls the window size , from 1 ( 3@@ x@@ 3 ) to 20 ( 4@@ 1@@ x@@ 41 ) used for the filter . large values increase the time the filter per pixel needs and can blur@@ red the image . the area indicated by the radius is smooth@@ ed over the image and the color in it is smooth@@ ed and smaller errors are adjusted .
sharp@@ ness : controls the sharp@@ ness of the sharp@@ ness . this value sets the pixel distance the filter looks forward to determine lumin@@ ance changes . if the value is too high , the adaptive filter image details can no longer be obtained and noise or s@@ me@@ aring occurs again .
edges : controls the edge accuracy for the sharp@@ ness . this value improves the frequency response of the filter . if it is too strong , the whole noise can not be removed or noise peaks can occur . put it to a value close to the maximum if you want to remove a weak noise or JPEG @-@ art@@ ef@@ acts without losing details .
lumin@@ ance : controls the lumin@@ ance tolerance of the image . we recommend either color or lumin@@ ance to change to improve a picture . these settings do not affect the smo@@ othing process that is controlled by the details settings .
color : controls the color tolerance of the image . we recommend either color or lumin@@ ance to change to improve a picture . these settings do not affect the smo@@ othing process that is controlled by the details settings .
g@@ amma : controls the gam@@ ut tolerance of the image . this value can be used to increase the tolerance values of the dark@@ er areas , which are typically stronger , however , it also gre@@ ases the shadow areas .
damp@@ ing : controls the adjustment of phase j@@ itter damp@@ ing . this value defines how quickly the adaptive filter radius respon@@ ds to variations in the lumin@@ ance density . when it is raised , the edges appear smo@@ other when it is too high , noise and phase j@@ itter appear at the edges .
store under and load : these buttons are used exactly for this purpose . all parameters for noise reduction you have set can be stored in the file system and loaded later .
this is an example of how noise reduction can change your life . the original image is marked with ( 1 ) and the corrected mit ( 2 ) .
sometimes a picture is too cra@@ cked for your purpose . the solution to draw the picture a little soft is fortunately much easier than sharpen@@ ing a picture . use the soft sign with the menu entry Cor@@ rec@@ t sof@@ tness and experiment with the smooth@@ ness . the preview window on the right side of the dialog displays the effect of this operation on your photo .
die &amp; digi@@ kam ; photo restoration is definitely one of the most advanced tools to reduce photo art@@ ef@@ acts .
this filter for restoration gives you the possibility to remove a lot of unwanted arti@@ facts from your pictures . it is very well adapted to remove Gau@@ ß &apos;s noise , film grain , scratches , compression art@@ ef@@ acts and local errors that occur in digital , original or subsequently digit@@ alized pictures .
the same algorithm can be used for color and texture replac@@ ements . the texture composition is performed using a different tool , the image error correction . the restoration algorithm has been developed by the I@@ MA@@ GE team of the G@@ REC CN@@ RS laboratory in Ca@@ en / Fran@@ n@@ k@@ reich and is part of the C@@ Im@@ g project .
JPEG Art@@ ef@@ acts reduce : the compression of JPEG is not perfect , in some areas even very far from it . as a loss @-@ prone compression algorithm he generates some compression &amp; quot ; Art@@ ef@@ ak@@ te@@ quot ; - small standards that can be seen in un@@ compressed image . this setting should correct these problems .
the Save As and Load buttons make exactly this . any setting of photo restoration can be saved in a text file and loaded later .
photo restoration is comparatively very fast during work . nevertheless , it can take a long time and pull a high CPU load . you can therefore cancel the calculation at any time with the exit button .
the module is applied to a black and white photo that has been recorded with a Min@@ ol@@ ta ( t@@ m ) 700@@ Si camera to an Il@@ ford ( t@@ m ) HP @-@ 5 movie with sensitivity of 3@@ 200 ISO . you can see the not@@ orious film grain on the faces .
below you can see another example of photo restoration . this time tex@@ tures were applied to an old color photo , which was read with a scanner . you can see the scan art@@ ef@@ acts caused by scanner lighting and photo paper . the original image is below ( 1 ) and the corrected image below ( 2 ) .
die &amp; digi@@ kam ; tool Hot@@ pixel allows hot pixels of photos taken with a CCD camera gem , eight were removed . it uses algorithms from the J@@ PE@@ G@@ Pi@@ xi project protected by Martin Dick@@ opp .
bright , dead or hot pixels are a problem especially in high @-@ quality raw @-@ mode photos as many cameras with JPEG compression have a built @-@ in suppression for hot pixels .
this tool can be used to remove &amp; quot ; hot pixels ; and &quot; quot ; bright Pix@@ el@@ Clear ; on a photo with a dark photo sub@@ traction method . there is currently no manual method to select the bad pixels .
download this file in the wizard with the button dark . the tool will automatically detect the hot and bright pixels . these are highlighted in the image preview .
if you have an old digital camera it is important that you record the dark image directly in order to detect new hot or bright pixels by CCD defects .
first , as described in the previous section , you should load the appropriate dark image to the image to be corrected . an automatic processing of the dark image will find the bad pixels .
the image area and preview will help you correct the result within the image . the preview window displays the output of the filter with the current settings . bad pixels are raised in all preview areas .
select an area to view the defective pixels on the preview and the results of the filter . then select the best filter method to inter@@ pol@@ ate these pixels blocks . these are the filters available :
average : an average of the neighbor pixels is determined . the resulting color is assigned to all faulty pixels in the block . for a 1 @-@ dimensional inter@@ pol@@ ation this is done separately for the horizontal and vertical line .
linear : all pixels that have a distance of 1 from the pixel block are drawn up to compu@@ te a bi @-@ linear surface ( 2 dim ) or a group of linear curves ( 1 dim ) . these are then used to inter@@ pol@@ ate the defective pixel in the block .
square : this is the default filter method . all pixels with a distance of 2 or less to the pixel block are drawn up to compu@@ te a bi @-@ square surface ( 2 dim ) or a group of square curves ( 1 dim ) that is then used to inter@@ pol@@ ate the pixels in the block .
cubic : all pixels with a distance of 3 or less are drawn to compu@@ te a bi @-@ cubic surface ( 2 dim ) or a group of cubic curves ( 1 dim ) that is then used to inter@@ pol@@ ate the defective pixel in the block .
below you can see the Hot@@ pixel correction on a color photo , from a defective digital camera with a sensitivity of 200 ISO and long exposure , applied . the original image has been enlarged to 300 % ( 1 ) and the corrected image is below ( 2 ) .
die &amp; digi@@ kam ; Vig@@ net@@ ting correction is a tool to correct the vig@@ net@@ ting , i.e. under@@ exposed corners , of an image .
wide angle lenses , especially those in medium and large photo format , can often not illumin@@ ate the entire sensor area evenly . instead &amp; quot ; vig@@ net@@ ting @-@ quot ; ( sh@@ aded ) they reduce the edges and edges of the image by reducing the light that reaches the sensor there . telep@@ hot@@ o lenses may also show this behavior .
many center filters require a factor of 1.5 or 2 in the aperture filter , which increases the necessary shutter speed in such a way that it is impossible to hold the camera by hand . wide angle lenses should also be used with center filters , an aperture of f / 16 or smaller , since otherwise the blur@@ ring effects are caused by movement .
with the large exposure ranges of today &apos;s film and gra@@ y@@ scale depth of digital cameras and film scann@@ ers , it is possible to simulate the effect of a Center@@ filter by applying an equivalent transformation on a raw image that has been made without this filter . the tool Vig@@ net@@ ting correc@@ ting turns the transformation with a Center@@ filter on a picture . the algorithm is protected by John Walker .
with three regul@@ ators you can control the vig@@ net@@ ting correction filter and with three further the exposure of the target image .
density : this parameter controls the degree of light intensity damp@@ ing at the point of the largest density of the filter . the standard density is 2.0 , which compens@@ ates for an optical filter with an aperture setting of 1 , or accidentally a luminous intensity of 2 . increase the density to compensate for a greater degree of vig@@ net@@ ting , reduce it by a small degree .
luminous intensity , contrast and g@@ amma settings : editing an image with the vig@@ net@@ ting correction reduces the brightness of the pixels . you need to read@@ just the exposure of the target image with these options . the controls only provide you with positive values , since you only need to increase the settings .
if you want a fin@@ er re @-@ adjustment of the exposure of the target image , leave the values for brightness / contrast / g@@ amma at zero and use the gra@@ dation from the Edit &amp; digi@@ kam ; image processing from the color gra@@ dation menu .
this is an example of the vig@@ net@@ ting correction on an image applied . the original image ( 1 ) shows the vig@@ net@@ ting in the corners and ( 2 ) the corrected image .
die &amp; digi@@ kam ; lens distortion is a tool to correct the impact of spher@@ ical lenses on photos . it uses a copy@@ righ@@ ted algorithm by David Ho@@ dson .
this tool works with geometric distor@@ tions . coloured distor@@ tions cannot be corrected with this tool .
the coefficient of the second degree covers the general geomet@@ rical distortion of the lens and can correct the conc@@ ave or conve@@ x shape of the image .
the coefficient of the third grade has a similar rounded effect , but fl@@ atten@@ s the edges . this correction is not applied in the tool .
the coefficient of fourth gra@@ des correc@@ ts the remote corners to that of the second grade . if you combine these two , any geometric distor@@ tions can be almost eliminated .
in general : this value controls the thickness of distortion second degree . with negative values , t@@ onal distor@@ tions can be corrected and positive cushion distortion .
corner : this value controls the thickness of the distortion fourth grade . this value is stronger at the edges than in the middle of the image . for most lenses the &apos; Corner Par@@ ameters &apos; has the inver@@ ted default character of the parameter .
zoom : this value re @-@ sc@@ aled the image size and results in a correction of the first degree . negative values increase while positive image size decreases .
ligh@@ tening : this value adju@@ sts the brightness in the corners of the image . negative values decrease the brightness of the image in the corners while positive values increase them .
to help you find the best filter settings , the dialog with a preview illustrates the distortion correction . the values you use for your image will be saved and used as default values at the next start .
the ton@@ ing or kis@@ sing correction should be performed before all trimm@@ ing or res@@ izing changes . it is best to perform this correction as the first . if you re @-@ cut an image and then perform a ton@@ ical correction , the effect would apparently be the wrong .
to help you find the best correction , this tool provides you with a vertical and horizontal support line . move the mouse poin@@ ter in the image preview to view the dotted lines . move it to an important place , such as the sea edge or a wall , in your image and press the left mouse button to fix the lines at this point . afterwards , you can correct the sound / cushion distortion with the help of the lines .
if you correct a cushion distortion , the resulting image will have black corners . you can remove them using the cutting tool in the Transform@@ ers menu from image processing or via the Zoom regulator in this dialog .
the next logical step for some motifs such as photos from the front , frame and paintings is to correct the perspective in such a way that all angles in the picture have 90 degrees . note that when you hold the camera with your hand you will always have a slight distortion of the perspective .
this is an example of the ton@@ ical correction applied to a church in Norway . the original image is below ( 1 ) and the corrected image below ( 2 ) .
the algorithm is based on a method for simul@@ ating inf@@ ra @-@ red film of the G@@ imp@@ anz@@ u.@@ org website which can be accessed under this URL . the filter re@@ produces the well @-@ known SF@@ X@@ 200 I@@ inf@@ rar@@ ot@@ film , see this URL . this film has a sensitivity range of 200 @-@ 800 ISO .
in the left side of the window , you can select the area for preview . if you move the red rect@@ angle with the mouse you can view the effect on different parts of the image .
below the preview you can set two parameters to set film grain and film sensitivity ( ISO ) . activate the option Add film grain if you want to simulate the gra@@ dient texture of a highly sensitive film . the ISO control changes the amount of film grain and the domin@@ ance of green ( chlor@@ ophy@@ ll in nature ) in transformation . green meadows are white like snow !
since the filter mixes color channels to reproduce inf@@ ra @-@ red film , especially the green channel makes no sense to apply the effect on black / white photos as the colour information is missing .
this is an example of the infrared filter effect applied to a landscape photograph from New Zealand . the original image is below ( 1 ) and the edited image below ( 2 ) . the sensitivity of the film was set to ISO 400 . higher ISO values create a kind of aura in the top lights .
die &amp; digi@@ kam ; filter movie gran@@ ulation is an easy @-@ to @-@ use tool to reproduce film grain on your images . this is known from classic high @-@ speed films such as the B / W Ko@@ da@@ k Tr@@ i @-@ X . in order to increase the sensitivity of the films the manufacturers mix large silver particles of the photographic emul@@ sion .
the film grain effect gives your photo a certain mood or seems to shift back into the past . the treated picture gets rid of a timeless ambi@@ ance from everyday life . if you want to use this special , gallery @-@ like , road @-@ photographic , gra@@ iny view especially in your mon@@ och@@ ro@@ me photos , you have to use this filter .
with the controller , the ISO sensitivity can be calibr@@ ated to control the intensity and gran@@ ul@@ arity of the grains . the default value is , although often higher values are required , to ISO @-@ 24@@ 00 . if you need more grains , you can apply the filter several times .
this is an example of the film grain effect applied to a black / white picture . the original image is the ( 1 ) and the used film sensitivity corresponds to ISO @-@ 1600 .
die &amp; digi@@ kam ; Filter oil painting creates the appearance of an oil painting . it uses a copyright protected algorithm by Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
die &amp; digi@@ kam ; Filter oil paintings give your digital pictures a nice appearance like an oil painting . natural images and still life are good for this effect .
there are two controls to influence this effect . the upper one sel@@ ects the brush size between one and five . thicker brush are better for large images . smooth the smooth@@ ness or , from the other side , the hing@@ es .
this is an example of the oil painting effect . the original image is marked with the ( 1 ) and the editing is marked with ( 2 ) . brush size for this 6@@ 40 pixel large picture is 1 and G@@ lä@@ tte 17 .
die &amp; digi@@ kam ; Filter char@@ coal drawing uses color and intensity gra@@ dients to create a coal sketch . images whose gra@@ dients are slowly changing are therefore not ideal for this effect . it is helpful if you imagine which scene you would have chosen to sketch you . these would be good pictures to start with .
there are two controls with a value range from 1 to 100 to control this effect . the upper knob sel@@ ects the pin size and the lower adju@@ sts the contrast ( smooth@@ ness ) .
this is an example of the carbon capture filter . the original image ( 1 ) and the changed image ( 2 ) . the default settings of 30 and 10 have been used . the result can be further improved by adjusting the intensity value .
die &amp; digi@@ kam ; Filter engraving shapes your image in 3 @-@ D as if it was st@@ amped in wax . it uses a copy@@ righ@@ ted algorithm by Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
die &amp; digi@@ kam ; Filter engraving is a quick tool to restore your images with a 3D effect . it works particularly well with images with a simple structure , in which color is not the most important part of the content . the filter uses the differences between color and intensity to turn the image into a gray , mon@@ oton@@ ous landscape .
the depth allows you to adjust the contrast of the filtering . a value of 30 , corresponds to 10 % , is the default setting .
this is an example of engraving Filter . the original ( 1 ) and the edited image ( 2 ) . the used depth is 10 % .
with this filter group you can transform a normal photo into a work of art using distortion effects . it uses copy@@ righ@@ ted algorithms from Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
wave blocks 1 : divide the image into cells and make it look as if it is considered by glass blocks .
wave blocks 2 : analog to the shaft blocks 1 , the picture is distorted here with a different version of glass blocks .
some effects need a long time to calculate and generate a high CPU load . you can cancel these effects at any time using the exit button .
with this filter group you can transform a normal photo into a work of art using blur@@ ring effects . it uses copy@@ righ@@ ted algorithms from Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
zoom S@@ hot@@ ter : blur@@ red the image along star @-@ shaped lines . this simul@@ ates the blur@@ ring a zo@@ oming camera and thus creates a dynamic expression that is often seen in sports photography .
radial bl@@ ur : blur@@ ring the image by turning the pixels around a center . this simul@@ ates the blur@@ ring of a rotating camera .
distance @-@ blur@@ ring : blur@@ red the picture to create the effect of an un@@ focused camera lens . the object seems to be trac@@ ed back into the background .
blur@@ ring : blur@@ ring the image by horizontal movements of the pixels . this simul@@ ates the blur@@ ring of a linear moving , z : B : taken from a car or train , camera .
blur@@ ring blur@@ ring : blur@@ red the picture soft in the dark and strong in the bright tones . this creates photos with a dre@@ amy and shiny soft focus effect ( Hamilton effect ) . this is ideal for creating romantic portraits , glam@@ our photos or adding a warm and subtle glow .
shaking blur@@ ring : blur@@ ring the image by random shifting of the pixels and thus simul@@ ates the blur@@ ring of an arbitrary moving camera .
intelligent bl@@ ur : finds the p@@ add@@ les in the picture and wi@@ pes them without changing the rest .
mos@@ aic : divide the photo into rectangular cells and then recre@@ ate it , by filling with an average pixel value , new .
some effects need a long time to calculate and cause a high CPU load . you can therefore cancel this calculation at any time with the exit button .
the rain@@ drops are a nice little tool to make rain@@ drops on your picture . this gives natural your images a wet look . it uses a algorithm protected by Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
drop@@ let size allows to change the size of the drops . since the drop@@ let size does not automatically grow with the size of the image it is often necessary to reduce the size for small images .
you can use the Edit &amp; Edit ; image processing to keep an area free of rain@@ drops . use the selection tool to select the area , e.g. a face that should remain free . if you start the filter then the area will remain free of rain@@ drops .
this is an example of the rain@@ drop filter . the original image ( 1 ) shows a quiet sunset and the edited image ( 2 ) suggests a sunset after a storm . the default values have been used for this example .
if the photo has the wrong orientation , you can place it by mirr@@ oring or rotating in the correct orientation . the tools for this can be found in the Transformation Utilities menu or transforming mirr@@ oring .
infl@@ ating photo is definitely one of the most advanced tools to enlarge a photo with a minimal loss of picture quality .
the big question is , how can you infl@@ ate an image and keep the details sharp ? how can you zoom into an image when the limits of resolution are reached ? how can you recover the missing information ? try it and you will see it yourself .
if a photo has the wrong size , you can scale it to the desired size with the tool size . choose this transformation size change in the menu and enter the target values . the dialog is shown below .
the tool for size change uses a linear inter@@ pol@@ ation method to approximate the pixels . if you want to enlarge a small picture with better quality then try the tool for infl@@ ating .
many image editing programs use a kind of inter@@ pol@@ ation , e.g. sp@@ line inter@@ pol@@ ation to enlarge an image . &amp; digi@@ kam ; uses a further developed approach . the underlying algorithm photo was developed by the I@@ MA@@ GE team of the CN@@ RS laboratories in Ca@@ en / France and is part of the C@@ Im@@ g project .
you have to tell the tool how you want to change the size . these settings are available in the New Size tab and listed below :
maintain aspect ratio : if this setting is enabled , the aspect ratio of the original image will be retained when entering the new size .
regul@@ arity : &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this parameter affects larger structures . the higher this value is set , the more is smooth@@ ed . this is necessary if there is a lot of noise as it is then difficult to estimate the geometry of the image . even if you want to create a &apos; van Go@@ gh &apos; turbul@@ ence effect it must be set higher than 3 .
the Save As and Load buttons are used exactly for this purpose . any st@@ aff@@ ing for photo magni@@ fication can be saved as a text file and loaded later .
infl@@ ate photo is very fast with what it does , but it can take a long time and pull a high CPU load . you can cancel the calculation at any time with the exit button .
you can see below an example for photo bubbles by enlar@@ ging a small color image to the double size . the original is ( 1 ) and the enlarged picture ( 3 ) . the preview ( 2 ) is the result of linear standard enlargement for comparison .
cutting a photo is not only a frequently performed operation , but also a frequently under@@ estimated tool to put together a picture . to cut a photo you just need to create a rect@@ angle with the mouse , by pressing the mouse button and drag the rect@@ angle . you will see this rect@@ angle while you move the mouse .
when you release the mouse button again , the area of the photo will be cut off . this gives you a good overview of how your photo would look after cutting . you can change the size of the area to be cut by dra@@ gging on the corners of the rect@@ angle .
once you are satisfied with the cut , use the button The trimm@@ ing button for image editing in the toolbar and the photo is trimm@@ ed ( C@@ trl ; + X ) . use the Save or Save file entries in the File menu to save the newly cut photo .
in the preview area , you can change the size of the rect@@ angle by moving the corners with the mouse . the aspect ratio defined in the dialog stays intact .
you can specify the orientation as high @-@ format or cross @-@ format in the tool Accor@@ ding to the aspect ratio . in the high @-@ format , the larger value of the height and in the cross @-@ format of the width is always assigned .
the tool Accor@@ ding to aspect ratio is using a relative aspect ratio . this means that it is always the same regardless of whether you are inch , inch or any other physical size . you can see , for example , a list of traditional sizes for photo paper and their aspect ratio below .
at the right end of the dialog there are two buttons to automatically center the selection horizontally or vertically .
at the bottom of the dialog you can use the Max . relationship button to cut the area to the greatest possible , depending on the chosen ratio and orientation .
the tool Accor@@ ding to aspect ratio saves its settings depending on the image orientation ( horizontal or vertical ) . if you use the cutting tool the next time , these settings are displayed as default values depending on orientation . the changed image dimensions are stored in the EX@@ IF tables , so that the EX@@ IF data reflect the cut image and not the original image .
the settings of the assembly help make it possible to da@@ zzle help , so that you can better compile your pictures . these help are :
harmonious tri@@ angles are based on the principle of simil@@ arity . like the third angel , harmonious tri@@ angles are a possibility to share a rect@@ angle in similarly harmonious tri@@ angles on the diag@@ on@@ als .
golden center : the golden center is a division that is based on different natural growth patterns , such as the spiral of a Nau@@ til@@ us shell or the leaves of a sun@@ flower . it appears in all possible things that we perceive as beautiful .
the golden ratio is the irr@@ ational number 1,@@ 6@@ 180@@ 33@@ 9@@ 88 ... and you have been used by the ancient Egyptians and Greeks who constructed your temples and pyrami@@ ds . artists and architects have used the golden ratio in all times when you put your pictures , buildings and even photos to give your creations a natural order and beauty .
the number deri@@ ves from Fi@@ bon@@ acc@@ i sequence 1 , 1 , 2 , 3 , 5 , 8 , 13 , 21 , 34 &amp; etc ; the resulting divi@@ der is 1 : 1.@@ 6@@ 18 the golden mean .
the golden center provides more liquid relief lines when you put together a picture . these help are listed below :
the Golden Spir@@ ale will bring you good results for your photos . compared to the third angel , the golden spiral produces a liquid line that can follow the eye through the image . this kind of composition leads the viewer &apos;s gaze along the line of the spiral and creates a symmet@@ rical visual flow in this way .
another rule is the rect@@ angles of the golden spiral , also called golden rect@@ angles . this rect@@ angles are used to create the golden spiral . it should be something that the eye direc@@ ts into the center of the composition . that can be a line or different objects .
the golden tri@@ angles also derive from the gold spiral discussed above . their verti@@ ces are the central points of the sides of the golden rect@@ angles . note that in contrast to harmonious tri@@ angles , golden tri@@ angles are not equal tri@@ angles . diagonal to these lines can appear a static object more dynamic .
if you use golden tri@@ angles to break up your frame , create an effect that is called dynamic symmet@@ ry by professional photographers . try to place your focus on one of the intersection points and other visual information in the tri@@ angles .
the Horizon@@ tal mirr@@ oring options can be used to mirror the harmonic divisions .
with the button Color you can set the color of the guides . if you have an image with many colors and a high contrast , the lines can be invisible . in this way , you can adjust the color of the lines to your current image .
the free rotation is a tool to rotate an image at any angle .
if you make a photo , then it happens easily that you do not keep the camera exactly vertical or horizontally . this creates a picture in which things are rot@@ ated by an angle . you can do this using the Edit &amp; digi@@ kam ; image processing and the tool free rotation . choose to transform Free Rotation and adjust the target angle .
rotate your image with the slide angle . the values on this sli@@ der are specified in degrees . with the Pre@@ ferences button you can set the sli@@ der to 0 degrees . a preview of the rotation is available on the right side of the window . the new dimensions of the image are shown on the top right .
for your help , the Free Rotation module provides a horizontal and a vertical line . move the mouse cursor in the image preview to position the two lines . after moving it over an important point of the image , you can press it with a pressure on the left mouse button . now adjust the angle as described in previous section .
after you have shot an image you will find unwanted tri@@ angular holes in the corners . one way to fix this is to use the function Trans@@ forming cro@@ pping from image processing .
an elegant way to cut the image is automatic cutting . choose one of the following options :
the Anti @-@ Ali@@ ases option smooth@@ es the picture a bit after rotation . note however the above warning .
all per@@ spec@@ tival transform@@ ations are performed by a fixed point to the so @-@ called reference point . this point is shown in the middle of the picture and is represented by a red circle .
to change the perspective you need to use the red squares at the corners of your image . the preview will be automatically rec@@ al@@ cul@@ ated . on the right side of the dialog you will find some information that will help you change the perspective :
new width : displays the width of the new image , including the empty spaces formed by the transformation into pixels .
new height : displays the height of the new image , including the empty spaces formed by the transformation into pixels .
angle to the left : displays the current angle in degrees at the top left corner of the transformed area .
angle to the right : shows the current angle in degrees at the top right corner of the transformed area .
angle to the left : displays the current angle in degrees at the lower left corner of the transformed area .
angle to the right : shows the current angle in degrees at the lower right corner of the transformed area .
after adjusting the perspective , the picture is slightly s@@ me@@ ared . for a single adjustment , this effect is small , but two adjustments create a double so strong effect and you should avoid this if possible .
after you have adjusted the perspective you get un@@ happy tri@@ angular holes in the corners . one way to clean this is to cut the picture with transform@@ ers cro@@ pping out of the image processing .
the sh@@ utter@@ ing tool is used to move a part of the image in one direction and move the other part into the opposite direction . a horizontal shift , for example , will shift the upper part of the image to the right and the bottom part to the left . in other words , a rect@@ angle is turned into a parall@@ el@@ ogram .
drag your image by using the horizontal angle and the vertical angle . if you press pres@@ ets , the angle will be reset to zero . a preview of the effect will be displayed to you and the new dimensions of the target image are displayed on the right of the preview pane .
for your help , a vertical and a horizontal line are displayed . move the mouse to an important point , such as the lake , a wall of a building on your image and press the left mouse button to fix the lines . you can now use the sh@@ utter@@ ing tool to adjust your image .
after you have done the sh@@ ear@@ ing , the picture gets blur@@ red . for a single sh@@ ear@@ ing this effect is usually negli@@ gible , but two certific@@ ations generate twice as much blur@@ ring and therefore you should avoid this .
after sh@@ ear@@ ing the picture has un@@ attractive tri@@ angular holes in the corners . one way to eliminate it is to cut the picture with transform@@ ers cro@@ pping out of the image processing .
you need a number of libraries and other packages to read and write image formats . therefore , the formats available depend on your system and , in some cases , from the way these libraries have been compiled . in most distri@@ butions you will be able to edit a large number of image formats .
due to this dependen@@ cy on other libraries it is impossible to give a list of all file formats available on your system . however , you will always find JPEG and TIFF below .
&amp; digi@@ kam ; displays only files in formats that you know . this is done on the basis of the file extension and a comparison of those with a predefined list . if the extension is listed in the list , the file in image editing will be displayed . you can change this list of file extensions and edit them . in the Configuration section , you will find more information .
almost all digital cameras store photos in one of two formats : JPEG or TIFF . some cameras allow you even to select the format to be used . a more detailed description of these file formats can be found in Wikipedia . &amp; digi@@ kam ; supports both formats .
image compression is the application of data compression procedures on digital images . redundant information is reduced in order to save the image data in a more efficient way .
JPEG 2000 is also supported . generally , there are better , smo@@ other results than JPEG at the same compression ratio . the 2000 version can also save loss@@ less when specified in the settings .
if you want to learn more about the raw image format , see Wikipedia , The L@@ umin@@ ous Land@@ scape and Cambridge in Colour very helpful instructions in English . you can convert raw format images to JPEG or TIFF with the raw image converter by &amp; digi@@ kam ; in the Configuration section , you will find more information about using Mod@@ ules with &amp; digi@@ kam ; .
more than 200 raw file formats are supported . all support cameras can be viewed at the bottom of the web page of Dave Coff@@ in . the table below shows a short list of raw formats supported by &amp; digi@@ .dll :
many digital cameras support the recording of short films . these clips are often recorded in the A@@ VI@@ - or MPEG format . &amp; digi@@ kam ; is not a film editing program and therefore has no built @-@ in choices to view or edit movies . if you click on a movie file &amp; digi@@ kam ; use the &amp; k@@ de ; use settings to play movies to start playback .

if you change the steps 4 and 5 , what you can do well if the initial contrast has been very good , then you can do the first four adjustments with the white balance module .
many tools you need to edit the photo processing are included in &amp; digi@@ kam . your description will follow here .
all image editing tools such as sharpen@@ ing , sof@@ tness , noise reduction , re@@ focusing , un@@ sharp mas@@ king , etc ; . use a uniform dialog type that displays the effect in a preview before the filter is applied to the current image .
( 1 ) : this progress bar shows the status of the filter to the current image . to the left of it , five buttons allow to change the comparison mode of the preview area . these modes are :
vertically share without dup@@ licate . the left pane shows the original and the right shows the filter applied to the area on the right of the selected preview pane .
horizontal parts without dup@@ lic@@ ates . the upper section shows the original and the lower one shows the filter applied to the area below the selected preview pane .
the left pane shows the original and the right to compare the effect of the filter .
horizontal dividing . the upper section shows the original and the lower one for comparison with the effect of the filter .
&apos;@@ M@@ ouse over &apos; style : shows the preview when the mouse is not in the preview area and otherwise the original .
( 2 ) : there are two buttons that you can turn on to display over and under exposure . the colors used can be adjusted in the general settings page .
( 3 ) : the frame to preview . you can drag this frame with the mouse within the image and place it on the part of the image you want to preview . preview in the left part of the dialog will be updated immediately .
( 5 ) : in the lower left corner : here is a help and the possibility to reset all buttons to your default values . all settings of the last use of the module are noted .
the page bar Properties displays the essential information about the selected image and is largely self @-@ explan@@ atory . it is group@@ ed in the following sections :
photo Properties : displays a summary of the most important parameters when shooting the photo . these data are from the EX@@ IF data when they are available .
this tab provides an intuitive card search tool based on the Mar@@ ble mini program . you can zoom in or out with the mouse wheel or hold it down and move it . move it while you press the left mouse button . press C@@ trl ; left mouse button to move a square . all images within these coordinates are filtered and displayed . of course , this requires your images to contain ge@@ o @-@ data .
&amp; k@@ color@@ edit ; is an editor for pal@@ ettes files . the application can be used to edit color pal@@ ettes and for selecting and nam@@ ing colors .
the pallet files , which are installed by &amp; k@@ de , can apply either to the entire system or only one user . in the latter case , they are located in your Personal folder for &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ Settings and Hot user defined color and last used colors .
in the dialog box , you can select from a list of installed pallets or browse the folders for files .
the cursor is displayed as a line in the pallet view . it can be moved by clicking on the area next to a color .
the color is described under the pallet view . here , the color name can also be changed .
it can also be used to select . to create such a selection , click the area next to a color to move the cursor there . then move the mouse with pressed left mouse button .
if the check box With the cursor is enabled under the button color , the color will be inserted from the color table at the cursor . the color is either inserted or over@@ written a different one ; depending on whether the mode over@@ write is selected .
a selection that has been created as described in the last section can be used together with the actions Copy , Cut and Pa@@ ste .
&amp; k@@ color@@ edit ; uses the following format for data in the clip@@ board : for each color three values for the shares of red , green and blue and an optional color name followed by a line @-@ end character , if another color follows .
the colors in the palette and the output of the color selection can be dra@@ gged with the mouse .
select a color somewhere on the screen and then find them in the color selection on the left .
graph@@ vi@@ z ; is a K@@ DE program used to view &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; -@@ dot ; the &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; programs are free layout programs . so far there was no modern &amp; GUI ; program to visu@@ alize graphs . the programs that include &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; include , are based on the program author &apos;s &amp; X11 ; - or &amp; t@@ cl@@ t@@ k ; programs with just a few functions .
the &amp; k@@ graphi@@ viewer ; project has set itself the goal of replacing these programs with a modern and user @-@ friendly graphical interface with all functions of a well integrated &amp; que ; program .
&amp; c@@ alli@@ viewer ; is a K@@ DE program for viewing &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; -@@ dot ; -@@ Gra@@ phs . die &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; programs are free layout programs . &amp; c@@ alli@@ viewer ; displays graphs with all the capabilities of a well integrated &amp; GUI ; program in a modern and user @-@ friendly &amp; GUI ; it has the following functions :
integration in &amp; k@@ ate ; and &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; ( so that a change of the graph in &amp; k@@ ate ; the graph is re@@ comp@@ uted and displayed in &amp; c@@ alli@@ viewer ; )
menu to open the graph in &amp; k@@ ate ; to open or graphs in &amp; c@@ alli@@ viewer ; in a &amp; k@@ ate ; component to open
loading large graphs ( currently there are problems starting at about 1000 knots and a h@@ ack to present more than these nodes )
further required software : &amp; k@@ graphi@@ viewer ; is a &amp; k@@ de ; program that pres@@ upp@@ oses the &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; tool &amp; dot ; for the presentation of the graphs . required in detail :
the main window displays the opened graphs , each in its own sub@@ window . initially , if you start &amp; c@@ alli@@ viewer ; without an argument , the main window is empty as in the lower screen@@ shot . in this case , the toolbar contains only the icon file and the ( empty ) list of last opened files . click the first icon to open the dialog file .
after selecting one or more &apos; dot &apos; files , the main window looks like in the lower screen@@ shot :
as you can see , an overview in the corner is displayed when the graph is larger than the drawing area . you can select a fixed position of this overview with the context menu or select this position automatically .
use the mouse wheel ( up and down without special keys , left and right with pressed and Alt + key ) ;
zo@@ oming is limited in both directions by factor 10 . below you see the maximum reduction of a graph .
if the currently loaded file has been modified by another program , the following window will be displayed :
you can choose whether the graph is to be re@@ charged or whether you want to ignore the change . &amp; k@@ graph@@ viewer ; can also remember your decision , so that later it will also be done . if you want to change your decision later , you can use the menu item Settings c@@ alli@@ viewer ; set up ... , see also .
if you open a graph file outside a running &amp; c@@ alli@@ viewer ; instance open , eg ; in the file browser or on the command line , you have the choice if you want to open a new &amp; c@@ alli@@ viewer ; or want to display the graphs to be loaded in a sub@@ window of the already running instance .
as with the last option , you can save your choice permanently , but can change it afterwards with the setup dialog .
at program start , you can re@@ open all graphs of your last session . again , you can save your choice both as well as change it later .
you can also specify how to split the graph to several pages . the number of horizontal and vertical pages can be freely selected .
if you are using multiple pages , you can choose whether the parts of the graph , which come to one page , be adjusted to this page . the aspect ratio is ignored . if you keep the aspect ratio , the pages may not be filled out by the respective sections of the graph .
page preview with one graph distributed over several pages without header and with a different font
page Er@@ ne@@ ut Load gives you the ability to specify the behavior when a file has been changed to the hard drive &amp; eg ; from another program . you can set a default behavior ( automatically rel@@ o@@ ad or ignore changes ) or ask the program each time .
the opening page allows you to specify the behavior of &amp; k@@ graphi@@ cally , when a graph is opened outside of a current session . you can set a default behavior for this case ( open the graph in a new window or in a sub@@ window of the current session ) or determine that each time is requested .
the session administration page gives you the possibility to specify the starting behavior of &amp; c@@ alli@@ viewer ; you can set a default behavior ( open or not open the files of the last session or not ) , or decide to be asked at any start afterwards .
the context menu , which usually appears at a click in the main window with the &amp; R@@ MB@@ N , opens up additional options :
here you can choose among various &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; -@@ Layout algorithms . the entries described on the website of &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z are :
the algorithm sets the edges in the same direction ( from top to bottom or from left to right ) and tries to produce as short edges as possible and as few edge overl@@ aps as possible .
the &amp; ne@@ ato ; algorithm is the default for ung@@ eri@@ zed graph@@ ene . it produces depic@@ tions according to the spr@@ ing@@ board model . the Kam@@ ada @-@ Ka@@ wa@@ i algorithm is used , which is syn@@ onymous with statisti@@ cally multi@@ dimensional sc@@ aling .
the &amp; F@@ DP ; algorithm generates a spr@@ ing@@ board model for ung@@ eri@@ fied graph@@ ene . it uses the fru@@ chter@@ man @-@ pure gold he@@ ur@@ istics , and includes a multi @-@ purpose trigger for treating large and clu@@ stered graph@@ ene .
the &amp; Cir@@ co ; algorithm arran@@ ges the nodes circul@@ arly according to the description of Six und Tol@@ lis , 1999 , and K@@ auff@@ man and Wiese , 2002 . it is useful for certain diagrams of multiple cycli@@ c structures .
opens a dialog where you can specify a layout command that will then be executed by a shell . the command should accept the graph file as a parameter , and display the calculated layout of the graph@@ ene after st@@ d@@ out in x@@ dot format . with such a layout command , you can give &amp; eg ; den &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; -@@ algorithms to change the graph with a filter before being drawn .
determines the type of graph ( judged or executed ) and uses the default algorithm for the respective type ( dot ; for directional , &amp; ne@@ ato ; for ung@@ eri@@ fied graphs ) .
if this setting is enabled , the overview shows if necessary . otherwise it will not appear and the positioning menu is in@@ active .
shows the What is the mouse poin@@ ter . with this mouse poin@@ ter , click on a &amp; GUI ; element to get more help to this element ( if any ) .

make sure that the window is completely displayed as some settings may not be displayed otherwise .
after pressing the button you have to wait until the scan is completed and the window to specify the image file will appear . please remember that the type BM@@ P does not comp@@ ress and therefore creates very large files . you also need to select or create the folder &amp; # 160 by saving the image .
you can create screen@@ shots after selecting the Import &gt; screen shot in the menu . a window appears in which you can set the different screen@@ shots :
select the complete desktop to read a single window under the mouse .
if all your own program windows are selected , the calling program will disappear , so you can see other screens and windows . otherwise , after a short delay , you will read the currently visible work@@ space .
the delay determines how long screen shot will wait before it starts . if you need to switch to other work@@ tops , you should select this delay enough to have the time to navigate there .
after the screen@@ shot has been made , the dialog box appears with the options described above .

Fli@@ ck@@ r is an online photo management on the Internet . Fli@@ ck@@ r allows you to send photos to people who are important to you . you can show your favorite photos of the world , place the photos of your camera online and show your photos safely and privately to your friends and family around the world .
the Export to Fli@@ ck@@ r module can be used to upload images from your computer to a Fli@@ ck@@ r server on the Internet .
when you use the module for the first time , you are guided through the creation of a token . this is used for your authentication . so it is virtually your reference to Fli@@ ck@@ r . a browser is started so that you can log in at Fli@@ ck@@ r .
after the successful registration , the module can send photos to the Fli@@ ck@@ r website . the following page will be presented to you after a successful registration .
simply close the browser window and return to the program . after pressing Yes , you get the dialog to upload photos to Fli@@ ck@@ r . this will be shown in the next section .
if the Export to Fli@@ ck@@ r is started for the second time , you will be greeted with the following dialog , which displays the current access permissions that the module displays . you will need write permission to upload it . you will be asked if you want to continue with these permissions .
the button Add Photos should be pressed once you have set all the other options . with this button you can select the photos you want to upload in a file selection box . when you press the O@@ k button starts up@@ loading the photos to Fli@@ ck@@ r Server .
the keyword field can be filled with a comm@@ a separated list of words . these are added to the image as key words during the upload .
the Public , Friends and Fam@@ il@@ lie options allow you to set the permissions on your images . by default , the photos are classified as private .
if you select the option Change the size of the photos before up@@ loading , the photos are changed before up@@ loading in the size . the size is taken from the value entered at maximum size .
the maximum size can be used to specify the maximum height of the images . the size is changed in such a way that the aspect ratio remains constant .
the K@@ IP@@ I module gallery export is a tool to export your picture collection to a gallery server
the K@@ IP@@ I module gallery export currently has no documentation . if you are interested in writing them , please contact the mailing list of the K@@ IP@@ I team at k@@ de @-@ imaging @ k@@ de@@ .@@ or@@ g. Please note : the participants of this list speak English .
the geographic location K@@ IP@@ I module allows you to add and edit GPS coordinates in the metadata of an image . the geographical data is stored in the EX@@ IF cat@@ ch@@ words of the image and loc@@ alization can be displayed in a map in an external browser .
the K@@ IP@@ I module for geographic loc@@ alization provides tools to locate ge@@ ographi@@ cally in the spher@@ ical coordinate system used by GPS and Galil@@ eo . height , long@@ itude and l@@ atitude are used .
to cor@@ relate your images with geographical data you need a GPS track as XML file in GP@@ X format . g@@ ps@@ b@@ abel and g@@ ps@@ man can download and convert the data for you from your GPS device .
image Ge@@ ographical loc@@ alization cor@@ relative . this interface can merge a number of previously selected images with a GPS trace .
select the images you want to cor@@ relate in the main window and enter the menu . the above @-@ looking dialog appears then . to perform a possible correlation between time and location , you need to load a track file with GP@@ X file .
when the file is loaded an automatic correlation that indicates the coordinates in red . GPS trace data are recorded in GMT time and therefore the camera position must be converted to GMT . this can be done with the time zone . set your camera time zone here .
the setting for the maximum time deviation indicates the upper deviation for the GPS time and camera position . if the deviation is lower , the data is merged . the maximum value for this is 2000 seconds .
if you have no trace data from one place for images , you can manually edit the GP@@ X file and add to the pictures . the time difference of 2000 seconds will then cor@@ relate all the images in this area .
the options inter@@ pol@@ ate and difference in minutes can be used if you have no suitable data . if you know that in reality a location is located in a big time difference between camera and GPS , you can set these limits here and then press the button cor@@ relate to inter@@ pol@@ ate .
the coordinates can be manually set with this dialog . this is useful when you have made a number of photos in the same place . since the dialog displays the coordinates of one call to the next you just need to use the button OK to set the data in the current photo .
the location can also be found and set with the displayed map . to do so , select the region and enlarge it e.@@ Add this time and again until you have reached a sufficient accuracy . the height must always be selected manually . the card can be changed between card mode , satellite image and a mixed mode .
completely outside the K@@ IP@@ I module , there are possibilities to hang the GPS data to the images . here is a small script that uses the hex@@ id@@ ool to provide a pile of images with GPS data .
the K@@ IP@@ I module picture gallery is a tool to export a set of albums as HTML pages .
this module can export your albums into a picture gallery from HTML pages to version 4.@@ 01 . you can select the albums that are to be exported as HTML pages and specify the parameters for the HTML pages .
the tab has four tabs in which the settings can be adjusted . the tab selection allows you to select all albums that should be exported to HTML . the albums are not displayed hierarch@@ ically . with the three buttons on the right you can quickly select a large number of albums . in the area below you will see the Al@@ ben@@ preview and the text that will appear in the header of the HTML page .
this tab is largely self @-@ explan@@ atory . the option For each image to create a page creates a gallery in which each image also gets its own page . if you click on an image , a new page opens in which the picture is displayed . otherwise , the image will be displayed directly with your standard image viewer , eg ;
the Album defines the settings where and how to save the gallery with all your associated images . select a folder on which you have write permission . a sub@@ folder named K@@ IP@@ I@@ HTML@@ Export which contains everything will be created there .
if you have selected the JPEG File Format , the EX@@ IF information of your original images will also be stored in the new images .
with Other color depth you can change the default color depth , which of course affects the file size . all other settings are self @-@ explan@@ atory .
the Ri@@ der thumb@@ nails allows you to customize some of the settings from the Album tab for the thumb@@ nails , these are small images that are displayed in the gallery .
a progress window shows the user how far the action is . press Cancel to cancel the process .
if the module has created the pages , the window is not automatically closed . you can therefore read the program messages to determine if errors occurred during production . the web browser is automatically started at the end to preview the gallery . press C@@ lose to close the module .
the K@@ IP@@ I Image Viewer is a very fast and flexible Open@@ GL @-@ based tool for viewing images .
the K@@ IP@@ I image viewer allows you to view a selection of images and to perform basic operations such as rot@@ ations , zo@@ oming or moving . the viewer can be used with short commands and mouse buttons . it has been developed for quick image display and quick access to its functions .
after the start , a picture is displayed by default in full screen mode . this can be changed to a window mode .
the K@@ IP@@ I JPEG Los@@ s@@ less Module is a tool to change images without compromising your quality .
this module allows you to save images in JPEG format for the actions listed below , without the usual loss of quality or metadata .
the consequence of loss@@ less storage is that the file size increases since there is no compression of the color information .
the K@@ IP@@ I module digital camera client is a tool to connect your computer to a digital camera .
the K@@ IP@@ I module digital camera client does not currently have documentation . if you are interested in writing them , please contact the mailing list of the K@@ IP@@ I team at k@@ de @-@ imaging @ k@@ de@@ .@@ or@@ g. Please note : the participants of this list speak English .
the K@@ IP@@ I module metadata editor currently has no documentation . if you want to change this situation , please contact the k@@ de @-@ imaging @ k@@ de@@ .org of the K@@ IP@@ I team .
with the import function of the metadata module , you can copy data from one image to another . then select the image that you want to copy in the main program and then invo@@ ke the Import function . this then opens the file selection dialog with which you want to copy the target image , i.e. the image to which you want to copy the metadata .
this function does not work with all image formats . you can copy from anywhere , but do not write into any target format . JPEG is supported while writing . please take a look at exi@@ v2 to see which formats are supported .
the K@@ IP@@ I MPEG Ko@@ di@@ erer module is a tool to convert a number of images into a MPEG video in the form of a slide show .
the MPEG co@@ dec module can be used to convert selected images to a MPEG video , with a defined length . this module uses the packages M@@ j@@ p@@ eg@@ Tools and Image@@ Magi@@ ck . you can also add a base image transition between the individual images . you can also add an audio file to the MP@@ 2 or WAV of the slideshow .
all images are automatically sc@@ aled to the correct size for the selected video format . additionally you can select a background color for the slideshow . with this module it is possible to create the formats DVD / X@@ V@@ CD / SV@@ CD / V@@ CD for your DVD player . to burn the medium you can finally use the K@@ 3@@ b program .
you must first select the images to be packed into the MPEG Di@@ ash@@ au . after that you can create the module via Tools MPEG Di@@ as@@ au .
the images you select are then listed in image files in the Portfolio . there you can also sort the images or the contents of the list .
after you are satisfied with your list , you should adjust the other settings . the video format can be selected from various formats , DVD , X@@ V@@ CD , SV@@ CD and V@@ CD . if you plan to play the file on a TV , you need to select the appropriate TV standard PAL , SE@@ CAM or NT@@ SC . PAL is default and most likely the right choice for Europe .
in the next step , you should specify the time in seconds that a picture is displayed . the speed of the image transition is defined below . a low value creates a very sudden , high contrast , very smooth image changes .
the background color can be set next . in doubt , you should leave it black . you can set the name and path of the generated file in the name of the MPEG @-@ output file . keep the extension mp@@ g as possible .
if you specify an audio file under the name of the audio source file , it will be integrated into the movie . after you have adapted all settings to your preferences , you can start the movie with the button coding . depending on the speed of your computer , you can now quickly or quietly enjoy a coffee and enjoy the slideshow if you are back .
if a note appears that enco@@ ders or tools are missing , you can adjust the paths to the programs of the M@@ j@@ p@@ eg@@ Tools and Image@@ Magi@@ ck packages via the button Settings on the bottom right .
the Print Job Wizard allows you to print multiple images on a sheet of paper along with standard photo sizes . the combined images can also be automatically opened using the image processing Gim@@ p . this is e.g. useful to improve you or print with the Gim@@ p module for direct printing .
with this K@@ IP@@ I module , you can import or convert your images stored in RAW format in one of three formats JPEG , TIFF or P@@ PM .
the conversion is based on the command @-@ line tool d@@ cra@@ w from Dave Coff@@ in . an original quote from him is : do not expect from d@@ cra@@ w to produce the same results as the software from your camera manufacturer . sometimes you get better results with d@@ cra@@ w ! .
first select the RAW file to be converted and start the module . the Ra@@ w Image Converter window will then appear in mode for a single image . with the Pre@@ view button you can view the effect of your current settings on the image .
you can now adjust the values to optimize the conversion process . the first option decides if the camera settings for the white balance should be used . the key parameters such as g@@ amma , brightness and red / blue amplifiers can be adjusted . if the result is not optimal , you can further process the image later .
a four @-@ colour R@@ G@@ BG conversion can be selected to allow you to use the contrast information . if your camera works in RGB mode , the R@@ G@@ BG switch has no effect .
once you are satisfied with the preview , you can select one of the three output formats and save the conversion result . the file name remains the same and only the extension will be adjusted accordingly . JPEG supports a loss@@ less algorithm and produces the smallest file sizes for it .
tagged Image Format , TIFF , retains all information from your image and uses loss@@ less LZ@@ W compression .
if you plan to edit your pictures frequently or later use it otherwise you should not select the JPEG format , since it only allows a limited number of operations before the image quality deterior@@ ates . TIFF and P@@ PM are better adapted to keep the original data retained .
if you select JPEG as memory format , the metadata that is included in the RAW file is stored in the JPEG file in the Ex@@ if information .
if you have adjusted your settings , you can start the conversion with the Run button . if you want to cancel this process again , you can use it Cancel .
batch processing mode allows you to convert different images at once . use this mode if you are sure , e.g. by testing a single image , which are the best settings .
the available settings are almost identical to the version for single images . however , you have the possibility to automatically over@@ write the existing file . however , this is useful if they were created in an earlier attempt . however , a preview is not available . the progress bar indicates how far the conversion has progres@@ sed .
this module can be used to comp@@ ress all images in an album . it uses the program convert from Image@@ Magi@@ ck package . the following image formats are supported :
this module can be used to ren@@ ame all images of an album . you can set the pre@@ fix , the number and the tim@@ est@@ amp .
this module can be used to change the size of multiple images of an image collection . it uses the convert program from the Image@@ Magi@@ ck package . you can reduce or enlarge the image . for this , four types of image change are provided :
proportional ( 1 D@@ im . ) : normal size change in a dimension . width or height of the image is selected automatically depending on the image orientation . the aspect ratio remains unchanged .
proportional ( 2 D@@ im . ) : size change in two dimensions . here the aspect ratio remains unchanged . for example , you can use this option to adjust your image to the screen format .
non @-@ proportional : not proportional size change in two dimensions . the aspect ratio is changed with this option .
pre@@ press : prepares the image for the photo print . the user can adjust the print resolution and the size of the photo paper . the target image , including background size , margin size and background color , will be adjusted accordingly .
with this K@@ IP@@ I module you can send selected images with your preferred e @-@ mail program . it is also possible to change the size of the images to be viewed .
after you have started the module , the picture window will be displayed with the images you selected . you can add more images using a file selection dialog . for the last selected image , a preview will be displayed on the right side .
you can also drag images to the image list and place them there to add the list of images to be sent .
with the button Remove the selected images from the list of images to be sent away .
after you have selected all the images , you can open the new message window of your e @-@ mail client with the OK button . you only have to add the addresses and the subject . the pictures you selected are attached as app@@ endi@@ x .
don &apos;t mind to send too many pictures at once . most email accounts have limitations for the size of emails to be sent . it may be a good idea to send multiple mails if you want to send a lot of pictures .
the e @-@ mail window is used to change the settings for sending the images . your configuration is stored and used every time you change it .
select your email client from the menu . if you select Thunder@@ bird , you must specify the right path for your installation in the input field below .
if you are using the Google Mail Service , you must first install the G@@ mail Agent on your computer . you can download it here .
after selecting comments in a attached file , the comments to the images will be added to a text file and the email attached .
the PNG format under the File Format menu is not very appropriate to reduce the size of photo files , but it is best adapted to loss@@ less formats such as TIFF . you should therefore use PNG if you have a fast internet connection and the photo quality should not be changed . otherwise we recommend you the JPEG format .
if you select JPEG in image file format and the original files are in JPEG format , then the original files will be added to the images to be sent .
when the process is completed , the window will not automatically shut down so you can view the status messages on the search for errors . however , your e @-@ mail program will automatically start at the end . with the closing button you can close this window .
after starting the Advanced Di@@ asch@@ au module , a window with questions like you want to have your slide show will appear . you can choose between the selected and all pictures of the album here .
the Open@@ GL transitions option in the presentation will enable very elegant image transitions using Open@@ GL . however , you will have to have a corresponding graphic card , otherwise the slide show will be very slow .
the option names file names will ensure that the file name of the images is displayed in the lower left corner during the presentation .
the Loop option ensures that the presentation will be displayed in an infinite loop . you can then run it manually with Es@@ c ; Cancel .
the option images random@@ ly select makes sure the images are displayed in random order . so it is not the order of the images used in the album .
the distance between the images can be set between the pictures . 1500 milli@@ seconds corresponds to 1.5 seconds and are a good default value . the best distance depends , however , on your computer and the selected transition effect .
there are more than a dozen transitional effects between which you can choose . random@@ ly sel@@ ects a different effect on every transition between the images .
during slide show you can access a toolbar at the top left edge of the screen . move the mouse into this corner to turn on .
with this tool bar you can stop the presentation and start again , jump to the previous and the next image and stop the slideshow .
at the bottom of the screen you can see the current fil@@ en@@ ame , the position of the current image and the total number of images in your presentation .
the K@@ IP@@ I module time &amp; date has no documentation yet . if you are interested in writing them , please contact the mailing list of the K@@ IP@@ I team at k@@ de @-@ imaging @ k@@ de@@ .@@ or@@ g. Please note : the participants of this list speak English .
the K@@ IP@@ I module background image is a tool to set a picture as a background image for the work surface .
this module sets the currently selected image , depending on the selected option of the sub@@ menu , as background for your K@@ DE desktop .
once you have provided your pictures and videos with ann@@ ot@@ ations , you can start with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; through these , see image . as you can see by comparing with the image , are now available in each group , i.e. in people , places and in group keywords entries .
in the browser window you will see the categories for which you have entered information when you have provided your images and videos with ann@@ ot@@ ations . additionally , there are entries to look for EX@@ IF @-@ based information , view the folder structure on your hard drive and of course view the current thumb@@ nails .
when you press the mouse on the entry , the view of the browser changes . see image .
when you select another person , only the images shown on which both persons can be seen . through this selection method , you can limit the number of images displayed by a few thousand images to a few single images .
if you have selected all persons , places and other settings , you can display thumb@@ nails to view the images of your area of activity .
in the picture each person has the same icon in front of their name . they can store their own thumb@@ nail album , which is of course also valid for places , keywords and other categories you have defined yourself . see the picture below .
to view images in addition to the names , select the button that is located on the right side of the toolbar . in the appearing context menu , you can select which view you want to use for the current category . this has the advantage that you can view e.g. symbols with pictures of persons and simultaneously a list of keywords ( if you have no suitable pictures for your keywords ) .
however , you must specify which image should be displayed for each individual person . to do this , you need to open the picture @-@ view window ( described in more detail ) and select the image for the appropriate person in the context menu . in the View window , you can customize the magni@@ fication factor according to your wishes and select which part of the image should be displayed or cut off .
when you enter the search entry in the main window , a dialog is displayed that is very similar to the dialog for specifying the image properties . you can view this dialog once again .
if you enter a string in the lab@@ eling or description field , the descriptions or descriptions of the images will be searched after this text . if you want , you can also enter a date to be searched ; the date can either be a part of the total date , e.g. 1971 , or the complete date . you can also use a range of two dates , such as 1971 @-@ 1980 .
with the options in the lower part of the window , you can browse all images according to specific names as you can see in the picture . here you can see images on which Jes@@ per , however , not Anne Hel@@ ene are depicted .
this is the user manual for &amp; photo@@ album ; if you do not like to read manuals , but rather want to try functionality , you have the following alternatives to this manual :
go to the homepage of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; and watch the quick entry , screen@@ shots and introduc@@ tory videos .
start &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; and select the demo in the first dialog , if you start &amp; photo@@ album ; start the first time , or select the menu entry k@@ photo@@ album ; demo . then some sample pictures will be loaded and you can try the functions of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ;
if you prefer to print this manual , you can find it on the homepage of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; as a con@@ ti@@ gu@@ ous HTML document to download .
at the bottom of the main window of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; see the tim@@ eline . a picture of this bar is shown here : . as the name suggests , this bar shows you date statistics about the images in your database .
the tim@@ eline can display several different units . each bar then displays another unit . you can switch between the units years , months , weeks , hours and 10 minutes . on the picture you can see a part of a database by displaying only 10 minutes sections .
the tim@@ eline can be used inter@@ actively in the following ways : you can change the displayed preview pane from the database ( if you select a date , the first image will display this date in the preview pane ) and the tim@@ eline always displays the current date of the currently displayed pictures when you navigate in the preview pane .
you can also select a section of the tim@@ eline by holding down the mouse button and drag the mouse over the ruler of the tim@@ eline , i.e. the time data . if you select an area , only images of this period will be shown in the preview view . you can cancel the selection by clicking on a bar of the tim@@ eline .
&amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; provides you two ways to create html web pages with your images . one is in &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; integrated and the other available as module ( see ) . in the following part of the user manual is described in &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; integrated version , which you can create from the File menu HTML ...
before HTML pages are created you need to make some settings . these are divided into the three areas Content , Layout , and Obj@@ ective . in the following each section will be described more accurately .
first , enter the title of the moment and a description that the HTML file should contain later . on k@@ photo@@ album ; HTML example pages you see an example of these settings .
next select whether a &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; export file to be created is to be seen on the overview page .
finally , you can choose which information to display on the HTML pages . this allows you to avoid displaying information that is obvious to the viewer . for example , all images are exported from a party . for example , all images are exported . you cannot use this setting to hide specific images from certain viewers .
in this section you can specify how the HTML pages should look like . most settings are un@@ ambig@@ uous , which is why this is not specifically addressed .
at the bottom of the page you can set up various resolutions for the images . this allows those who view your website and have a monitor that supports the maximum resolution 800@@ x@@ 600 , no longer download images that have , for example , a resolution of 16@@ 00@@ x@@ 1200 .
the viewer of your page can change the resolution you have specified at any time . so you can browse your images with low resolution , leading to a lower transfer time . if you want to get an image bigger , it changes to a higher resolution .
in this setting , specify the different folders and the URL where your site is stored .
best choose a root folder for all your HTML files and a new sub@@ folder for each subsequent set .
first , you need to select the main folder where all your images are saved . this folder is saved and automatically added next time . this allows you to select the location for all future images . here you can either select a folder or a K@@ DE support protocol , for example :
after you have created your images , you can check if they really are visible to viewers . if you select a URL for the base folder , a web browser will be launched after the pages have been created . otherwise , the web browser will start in the wrong folder .
if the HTML files created by you are not yet in the final destination folder , you have to manually copy them there . so that the import function , see , works properly you have to specify the final destination of the files . this is not the sub@@ folder of the current files , but the base folder in which all sub@@ folders are located .
the settings described above have all related to the base folders or URLs . a sub@@ folder will be created in them , whose name you specify in the output folder .
if you are on a family celebration , a meeting in the company , a conference or somewhere else , with other users of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; coming together , you might want to create an HTML page for viewing the images . however , if you have spent a lot of time for viewing the image information , people on the pictures , recording location , etc . , then you must start with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; this work will not happen again .
with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; you can export a copy of your images into a .@@ k@@ im file . these can import others into your database . the image properties are imported with ex@@ - and imported .
there are two different types of .@@ k@@ im files , internal and external . they differ in whether the images themselves are stored in the file or if there is only a link to images in the file . the advantage of saving all images into the file is that you have all the pictures together and that you can share this file as independent . however , the obvious disadvantage is the file size .
you can either export a .@@ k@@ im file directly from the File menu ... or together with HTML pages , see , create . if you create a .@@ k@@ im file along with an HTML file , this will be an external .@@ k@@ im file .
an external .@@ k@@ im file searches the images in a tw@@ o@@ fold way . first , it searches the images that are located in the .@@ k@@ im file folder . if the corresponding images are not found , the images of the URL you specified when creating the HTML files will be searched . this is of course only possible if you have created your .@@ k@@ im file using the HTML export .
in the following , the dialog for ex@@ porting images is described , which you can access via the Export Data menu .
the most important option of this dialog is whether you want to deal with internal or external .@@ k@@ im files . you have the following three choices :
in the manual copy option to the .@@ k@@ im file , you need to copy the images to the same folder as the .@@ k@@ im file .
with option Automati@@ cally close to the .@@ k@@ im file copy &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; the images automatically for you .
.@@ k@@ im files are normal zip files . since most pictures are already compressed with JPEG and the XML file itself is very small , it is usually not worthwhile to comp@@ ress the files .
the last option of this page is to limit the maximum image size . if you send pictures to your friends , you might not want to send the pictures in full size , since the .@@ k@@ im file would otherwise be very big . here you can limit the size by saying that each image should be at most 800 pixels high and wide .
if you select a file with the extension .@@ k@@ im from the web browser or from the File menu ... select , will import &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; the exported database as described in described .
the wizard for im@@ porting is made up of four steps . first you need to select which images you want to import , then in which folder you want to copy the im@@ porting images .
it may be that you person@@ alize the category of persons belonging to the imported file ( if you are a domain ) , while this category is named in your database . therefore , in the third dialogue window , you will be asked which categories of the file to be imported and which categories they correspond to in your database .
in the fourth step , you can compare the categories of the file to be imported with the categories of your current database . an example of this can be seen in the image .
it just has to be easy to browse and view pictures : if you look at pictures , you often want to jump within different picture groups and see a picture with your friend on it , you might want to see all the pictures on which this friend is depicted .
in this manual , you will go through the various steps of ( 1 ) setting the information about your images , via ( 2 ) browsing and viewing , up to ( 3 ) advanced topics and custom@@ ization options .
it has been extended and now takes care of your videos . many places in this manual will talk about pictures , but often this includes videos with one .
&amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; stores all its information in the file inde@@ x@@ .x@@ ml in the top folder of your images . this is a simple XML file that you can backup with a program of your choice , e.g. Nor@@ mal backup tools , copy to a floppy or re@@ visions in CVS , where they want .
&amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; re@@ members the folder where your images are stored and use it automatically in future starts . if you want to read another database in &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; you can start &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; with the -@@ c option . as an example : k@@ photo@@ album -@@ c ~ / company / images / inde@@ x@@ .x@@ ml .
via the menu entry Settings k@@ photo@@ album ; set up ... you will get to a window with which you can change the settings of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; in the following section of the User Manual the various settings are explained .
on the left you can see six different icons that allow you to view settings of the preview and the options for the viewer . for each setting there is a detailed help that can be called by pressing the F1 key and clicking on the desired option .
it describes how you can define various properties for each image , e.g. persons , places and keywords . you can also create your own groups , such as objects , animals or albums .
you can see the dialog used to edit existing groups . for each existing group , you can select a label and a symbol .
in the Options section , sub@@ categories have already been mentioned . in the Options dialog , you can set up complete member groups , i.e. all members of a group at once in a group , rather than all groups of a member as explained in .
in the list below you can select the category you want to configure . in the left half of the window you can select the category you want to configure . in the left half of the window you will find a list of the current category and in the right a list of sub@@ categories .
&amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; spl@@ its its module system with other graphic applications , such as digi@@ plug and G@@ wen@@ view . this module system is called K@@ IP@@ I and means &amp; k@@ de ; Image Plugin interface .
the modules can be called via the Module menu . the modules can and will not be described in this manual as they are not part of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; however , most modules have a help page that you can call via the module itself .
since the modules are used by several applications together , it may be that the modules with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; only very little tested . therefore , you should always test new modules with the demo database before you apply them to your own pictures The &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; demo database can either call you through the command line with the command &gt; k@@ photo@@ album -@@ Demo &lt; user@@ input \ &gt; or via the Help menu . don &apos;t say that I wouldn &apos;t have warned you !
the applications that use the modules over K@@ IP@@ I are very different , making it possible that some modules with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; not work . this is the disadvantage when sharing features with different applications .
the biggest difference between &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; and other applications that also use K@@ IP@@ I is that the other applications can arrange their images in albums : an album is simply a folder . even though &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; this kind of order does not support , it simul@@ ates order after albums for some modules , so that you can use the functions with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ;
simul@@ ates &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; the current album , which just corresponds to the current view , so all pictures that show you the picture preview at the moment .
in addition to the current album , you need to give the modules a list of albums as well . here goes &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; as follows :
if &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; s Browser shows the contents of a category , e.g. all persons , then each entry of this category represents an album for the module .
or it will use the category you have set in the Settings dialog as a category for virtual albums . so , for example , if you use the category Per@@ sons , will do &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; so do so if you chose people to view it and pass it on to the module .
since some modules with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album are not compatible , you can remove them from the list of modules . start the settings dialog and select which modules to load .
on the picture you can see an example of a start screen as soon as you start &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; start with your own pictures .
as you are used by any other K@@ DE application , you will see a menu and toolbar at the top . currently , it does not contain much information as you have not entered your image database . in the section , we will return to this window , but now click on the image to show you an overview of all existing pictures .
one of the main features of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; is the ability to see any picture with ann@@ ot@@ ations . this includes information about the persons shown on the image , where the image is taken . you can set each image individually or for a larger number of pictures at the same time .
all these notes can be used for searching and browsing as you can read in the section . if you want you can see these comments if you use the built @-@ in viewer .
you can view three lists with a text box by setting people , places and keywords . these are a very important part of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; as you will always use them again whenever you enter information about your pictures .
the following idea is based on moving the images within the list : for example , if you have a family party and are shown on all 50 images the same 5 @-@ 10 persons , you can , by shifting the names used upwards , find the persons faster and assign them .
if you prefer to get an alphabe@@ tically sorted list , click on the Sor@@ ting button on the date below the list .
if you have selected ann@@ ot@@ ations for each image separately , you may want to edit all the selected images and add them with ann@@ ot@@ ations . in this case , simply click on the above and back buttons , which are located at the top of the image below .
if you have recorded multiple images , e.g. with the same person , it can be more convenient to mark all these images and use the menu item Multiple entries at once with a note .
Las Vegas , San Francisco , Los Angeles and California are all located in the US . San Francisco and Los Angeles are also in California .
in the picture you can see a browser window that shows the USA as a sub@@ group . to show you that it is a super@@ group , a special symbol is displayed .
in the Comment dialog context menu it is possible to add an entry to an existing or new sub@@ category . in addition , you can also simply drag an entry into a category and drop it to make it an sub@@ category of this entry .
you can move the individual elements of the ann@@ ot@@ ation dialog by clicking and moving the bars that form the top edge of the frame . you can also make your own window from a frame by dra@@ gging it out of the window area .
if you have adapted the look of the window to your needs so that you are satisfied with the settings , click on the Options button ... that offers you the possibility to save the current layout and appearance of the window .
you can also completely fade out a frame . if you want to see this window later , use the Options button ... and then hide / hide windows . you can see this in the picture .
if you select the entry Images in the browser , you will get an overview with thumb@@ nail images of the currently selected images , or all the images in case you have no filter . an example of this can be seen here . you can configure the size of thumb@@ nails , by simply dra@@ gging the mouse with the middle mouse button .
if you drop an image on the background of your desktop , this image is set up as a wallpaper for your desktop .
once you click on an image , it will be displayed in the image viewer . if you haven &apos;t opened a window with an image viewer , a new display window will be created .
you can also delete images in the image preview . simply select the appropriate images you want to delete and press either the Remove button or select Del@@ ete from the Edit menu . now the window will be displayed you can see in the picture .
&amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; offers you a solution for this problem . you can use with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; namely , you can use the images anywhere , so that &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; you can record in the database index . in the picture you see the view of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; if not all needed pictures can be loaded from the hard drive .
images in which the upper left corner is cli@@ pped are not saved on the hard drive . however , for the pictures 5 @-@ 9 the thumb@@ nails are present , so that &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; you can preview these pictures with the image viewer .
as you see , this function requires you to copy files from the folders and copy them back . &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; does not support it until now . so if you want to avoid trouble , such as browsing your pictures , please buy a larger hard disk to store all the images on it .
in the menu pictures you will find a sub@@ menu with the name privacy . if you want a little more privacy , filter the pictures so that at the end those remaining you want to make for others in@@ accessible and click Current View in the privacy menu . alternatively , you can also control all the pictures that your little sister can see , control and block the menu entry All out of the current view .
with this you have set which images are to be hidden in case of the case . if you give the laptop to your little sister , simply select the menu entry Images to be hidden , so that all the images you have locked will be hidden . if you want to get the pictures again displayed , click on lock .
it is also possible to set a password that needs to be entered to unlock the images . to set up this password , simply select the password in the privacy menu .
please bear in mind that this picture protection is by no means very safe . on the one hand , all images can be found on the hard disk and on the other , anyone who can access the file inde@@ x@@ .x@@ ml can read or delete the password as un@@ encrypted text .
the reason you spend all your pictures with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; manage and spend hours about hours with it is natural that you want to look at them some@@ time . for this reason &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; via a picture _ and video viewer . you can start this from the preview as described in .
the viewer can see you in . he obviously shows the image , but additional all the information you have entered through the image , such as who is on the picture , when and where was it done , etc .
if the information box on the top of the image you want to see , you can simply drag it with the mouse and disc@@ ard it elsewhere . you can also configure which information is displayed and whether information should be displayed . all of these options are available right @-@ click on the viewer .
some words in the info@@ box are under@@ lined . if you click here on the browser , see the appropriate entries to this display . so if you click on Anne Hel@@ ene , the browser shows you all the images of Anne Hel@@ ene . as if you had selected persons from the browser and then Anne Hel@@ ene .
if you have loaded multiple images in the viewer , you can switch between them before and back by using the image and down the image . you can jump to the first and last image with Pos@@ 1 and end . these functions can also be accessed from the context menu .
if multiple images are loaded in the viewer , you can run them as slide show . &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; then loads a new image after a few seconds . how often it loads a new image can be controlled by pressing the C@@ trl key and plus or minus .
a very useful ability of the viewer from &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; it is possible to switch to full screen mode . in this mode the viewer uses the entire space on the screen . simply use the input button to switch to full screen mode and back .
when you use the viewer you can simply drag and zoom in the image . you can simply zoom out a rect@@ angle with the mouse . with the Min@@ us button you can zoom out the plus button zo@@ oming in the middle of the image and shows the result of the zo@@ oms .
with the point key , you can reset your zoom , so that the image is not shown zo@@ omed . with the same button you set the zoom , so that every pixel on the screen corresponds to a pixel of the image .
note that the only zoom operations that work with videos that are in and out with the plus and minus key .
with the rotation functions from the context menu you can turn the picture . this does not work with videos . you can make comments to the current picture with the menu item ann@@ ot@@ ations from the context menu .
when you look at pictures it may happen that you find a picture with a person whose name you forgot to put on the picture . at the moment you can view this and open configuration dialog of the image to enter those names .
another situation is that you want to send a number of images to a printer to get the pictures developed on paper . to see what photos you want you can start the viewer with the images and mark them as good or bad while you watch one by one .
for the two examples above , the viewer gives you the opportunity to view images with features while viewing them . features are the letters A to Z and you can make a feature by pressing the corresponding letter . in view a picture where the features A , B and C are set .
once you have set features on your images , these are available to you in the browser . so if you print all the images you want to edit , print or whatever you have selected , just mark them all at once with ann@@ ot@@ ations . this is described in . after that you can use a module to copy the selected images to a CD or whatever you want to do .
categories and special features can be viewed in preview view . if you want to view categories in the preview view , then you can add features to the images by simply pressing the letter for the feature after the image has been selected .
sometimes it is not clear what you want to show on a picture . in this case , you allow you &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; paint on the picture .
the batch is not saved with the image , but in the database . the way you can und@@ o your painting later .
in the painting mode from &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; select on the painting from the context menu . to finish the painting simply press the cross in the toolbar at the top of the window .
to be able to work with &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; you need to use the program &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; not fully control , but the documentation to &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; should you absolutely read and understand .
in the object tree you can select individual objects . then their properties are displayed in the object properties and the object is displayed in the wi@@ re@@ mod@@ al views .
you can also select multiple objects simultaneously . but not the object of an already selected object , since all sub@@ objects are already selected with the object .
to insert a new object into the object tree , select the position where you want to insert the object and click either the icon in the toolbar or select a menu item in the In@@ sert Menu .
if there are several possible positions , the following drop @-@ down menu will be displayed so that you can choose the correct position :
del@@ eting either from the menu bar or from the context menu of the right mouse button , you can remove selected objects from the scene previously .
if you have changed properties , click Apply to Apply these changes . if you have entered invalid values , a message will appear with a fault description . then you can correct the input errors and then click Apply or reject the changes with Cancel .
if you enter the path to &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; user documentation in the setup dialog , you can call the &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; reference to the displayed object with help .
you need the &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; 3.@@ 1@@ g or 3.5 H@@ M@@ TL user documentation to use this feature . if this documentation is not included in your distribution , you can download it here . &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; 3.5 already contains the user documentation .
when editing a texture or part of a texture , you can see a preview in the property view .
click preview in the property view and a small sample of the scene is rendered with the selected texture . as default , the entire texture is rendered , even if you want to render a part of the texture ( for example a texture within a texture map and not the entire texture map ) , cross local .
the screen shot shows the control points of the camera . you can drag these control points with the mouse button and change the position and direction of the camera .
when a transformation is selected , the control points disappear and a small cross is shown in the wire model view . this cross marks the center for sc@@ aling and rotation as well as the position for shifts . you can change the shift by dra@@ gging with the mouse within the entire window .
each object has a Visi@@ bility level as a wire model . you can specify this value relative to the level of visibility of the parent object or as absolute value . objects are displayed only when they are selected or their visibility level is smaller or equal to the visibility level chosen in the toolbar .
&amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; has a window arrangement as default . the object tree and the view of the object properties are shown on the left and the four graphic views on the right .
if you don &apos;t like the standard window order or if you need a different configuration , you can set it as you like . you can also store multiple window orders and simply switch between different arrangements .
to anchor a window above or below a view , drag the beginning to the top or bottom of a view . a rect@@ angle then displays the new position .
to create a new column , drag the start to the right or left side of a view . the new view is then anch@@ ored to the right or left side of this view and extends over the entire height .
if you want to arrange several views over one another , drag the beginner in the middle of a different view . you can then switch between the views by clicking on the tabs at the top of the views .
the last possible window arrangement are floating pa@@ ge@@ views : views which are not anch@@ ored in the main window . to solve a view from anch@@ oring , drag the temp@@ ter to the desktop or click on the small arrow pointing to the left at the beginning bar .
to close a view , click on the small cross in the beginning bar . to prevent closing , click on the small square between the arrow and the cross .
you can insert additional views into the main window . in the View menu you will find entries for any type of views . new views are floating , you can anchor them in any place .
you can save the current window view with View Window System ... to save . it displays a dialog where you can store the window order under an existing or new name .
if you have created a scene you can render it . &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; used &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; 3.@@ 1@@ g to render , this program must be properly installed .
to render the current scene , click on Ren@@ dering icon Ren@@ dering on the toolbar or select the menu entry View scene ren@@ ders .
render mode matches the entries in &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; s ini files . it determines the image size and quality of rendering . if you want to render a scene in different image sizes and quality levels , you can insert as many render modes , from a quick preview up to full images of the highest quality .
when you click on the render settings icon in the toolbar , or select R@@ ender modes in the View menu , the following dialog will be opened :
each render mode has a name . you can enter any name , but it makes sense to identify the properties of the mode .
in the map size you can enter the width and height of the rendered image . if you want to render only a small area of the image , select the check box sub@@ section and enter the image section for rendering in the input fields .
in the combination field quality you can select the properties that &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; used for rendering . this goes from a very simple color and light model to a model with complex @-@ diff@@ use reflection illumination . a detailed description of the render properties can be found in the user manual on &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; .
if an image is rendered with just one ray per pixel , different errors can occur . these images often have a mo@@ ir@@ é pattern or step effects in curves and lines , and sometimes details are not displayed when they are smaller than one pixel . this effect is called ali@@ asing .
&amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; uses a technique called anti @-@ ali@@ asing to reduce the impact of these errors . generally , pictures with this property look better .
when you turn on anti @-@ ali@@ asing , calcul@@ ates and connects &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; more than one ray per pixel . this technique is called super @-@ sampling .
&amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; supports two methods of super @-@ sampling . as default an adaptive , non @-@ recur@@ sive method ; adaptive because the super @-@ sampling receives the neighbouring pixels . the second method is adaptive - recur@@ sive , because each pixel is split again and again because the recur@@ sion depth depends on the calculated colors .
if you select the first method , POV @-@ Ray tracks a ray per pixel . if the difference between the color values to the adjacent pixel exceeds the specified threshold , then both pixels are calculated by tracking a certain additional number of pixels with super @-@ sampling . if you set the depth value to 4 , a grid of 4 x 5 x 5 ( 25 ) will compu@@ te additional rays per pixel .
the difference between two pixels is calculated as follows : r 1 , g 1 and b 1 are the values for red , green and blue of the first pixel , r 2 , g 2 and b 2 are the values for red , green and blue of the second pixel . the difference then is :
diff = abs ( r 1 -@@ r 2 ) + abs ( g 1 -@@ g 2 ) + abs ( b 1 -@@ b 2 )
the recur@@ sive method starts with 4 rays per pixel . if the difference between the color values exceeds the default threshold , then the pixel is divided into 4 sub @-@ pixels , which are individually followed and checked for further sub@@ division . the maximum depth of the recur@@ sion can be adjusted with the depth value .
another way to reduce the ali@@ asing effect is the creation of noise for the beam process called J@@ it@@ tering . if you turn on it@@ tering , change &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; the rays are a tiny amount to avoid regular patterns .
the final setting for the quality of rendering is diff@@ use reflection . this is an experimental feature of &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; which calcul@@ ates diff@@ use light reflection . it takes very long to calculate a scene with this property .
on this map you can set whether the alpha channels should be calculated by POV @-@ Ray . a pixel is then transparent when the associated rays hit no object .
opens a new window for displaying the &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; -@@ console output . if &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; un@@ expect@@ edly terminated , you can find the reason for this .
to import a &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; scene , select the menu entry file Import ... and select a file in the dialog box .
currently supported &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; not yet the complete command range of &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; if error messages or warnings occur when im@@ porting , a dialog box shows a list of all messages .
if you do not support source code in &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; import , write this source code between the two special comments / / * PM@@ R@@ w@@ Begin and / / * PM@@ R@@ w@@ End .
you can drag objects from the object tree to the editor to export the source code for &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; this adds the source code of the object into the opened text file in the editor . to import objects to the scene , simply select the source code in the editor and drag it into the object tree .
copying and past@@ ing in &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; and in your editor you can insert source code for &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; also insert .
the POV @-@ Ray command is inv@@ oked when &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; a scene ren@@ ders . usually this is po@@ v@@ ray or x @-@ po@@ v@@ ray .
if you click on help in the property view , open &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; the &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; user documentation on the displayed object . here , set the path to your document and the version . supported are versions 3.@@ 1@@ g and 3.5 .
&amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; searches for external files ( e.g. height field data ) in the paths to the &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; -@@ Li@@ br@@ aries . if you include files that are not in the folder of the scene , you must also enter the path to these files here . if a file is found in different paths of the library , the first found file is used .
the color for the wire models . the second color is used for displaying the selected objects .
the color for the control points . the second color is used to display the selected control points .
the color of the rect@@ angle for the field of view in the camera view and in the window type plates .
you can set the object size of the points to the grid in the context menu of the wire model views . you can set the grid separately for shifts , sc@@ aling and rot@@ ations .
larger values result in a more accurate wire model and therefore better approxim@@ ation for the displayed objects , but require more time to render . for some objects such as the ball , you can set the level of detail separately for two directions .
when you tick high detail fi@@ del@@ ity for extended projections , all wire model views are further divided when the camera uses an extended projection . advanced projections are all projections with exceptions from perspective and vertical projections . this feature gives a better approxim@@ ation for projections , but requires more time to render .
when you display a wall , a wall behind the objects is rendered . the wall is represented in a check@@ er@@ board pattern of two adjustable colors .
when you display the floor , a floor underneath the objects is rendered . the floor is represented in a check@@ er@@ board pattern consisting of two adjustable colours .
when you tick the edge smo@@ othing , the non @-@ recur@@ sive anti@@ ali@@ asing method is used for rendering scenes . you can adjust the values for depth and threshold values .
this page allows you to change existing window orders or create new window orders . in the Windows Reg@@ ulations section , we will explain how to create and store window orders .
the standard window arrangement sel@@ ector : displays all existing window orders . &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; uses the selected window arrangement when starting the program .
the list of existing window orders displays all existing window orders . a new arrangement can be created with the Add button and del@@ eting a selected arrangement with the Del@@ ete button .
each window order is identified by the name . the name must be unique and must not be empty .
the list below the name displays all views for the selected window order . new views can be created with the Add button and del@@ eting selected views with the Del@@ ete button .
with new column you create a new column on the right of the existing windows , with Un@@ ten you anchor the window under the existing window , with card card you will get a map map view together with the previous view and floating anchor the view not in the main window , but creates a separate window .
so you just have &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; and &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; installed and now you want to start without more detailed knowledge of the two programs . if you follow all steps in this guide , you should be able to create the ultimate but simple scene , among beginners very popular : a sphere on one level .
but you should carefully consider the following warnings before you complain that as a result , you only receive a black screen . if you use a 3D program for the first time , you should consider these important rules :
if you do not set a camera , no rules can be applied for rendering , as a result you get a black picture .
if you do not insert any light sources , your whole scene is in the dark and you get only a black picture .
if you have installed everything correctly , see the first start of &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; the following default window order :
take a little time to get to know the menus and the existing Symbols of the Tool@@ bar . please read the documentation so that you can get a reasonable idea of what you can expect from this program .
you will have to use these menus and symbols right now , so you should remember the menus and symbols and also their application .
&amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; starts with a simple scene . to follow this guide , you must first remove all objects from the object tree . select the scene and then select the menu entry Edit .
the wire model view shows how the camera views the whole scene you create . in particular , note that in the fourth wire model view ( right down ) . this is the view of the scene from the view of the camera . this shows you the result of rendering the scene .
the object tree now contains a new entry with the name camera . when you click on it , you can see the contents of the View object properties in which the different parameters of the camera are found . in the user documentation to &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray , see more details .
do not change the basic settings of the camera , this is subject to later guidance , but note that the camera in the view has control points with which you can change the destination of the camera . simply click on a control point with the left mouse button and drag it to the desired location .
when you press the Apply button or the Enter key , the wire model views and the object tree change immediately according to these settings . as a result , they see the scene from the view of the camera .
there are many ways to create the floor for the scene . for example , you could insert a header ( insert final body shapes ) and adjust the size to x = 100 , y = 0 and z = 100 , but that is a cum@@ ber@@ some method to solve this task .
&amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; actually provides a simpler option . you can use an infinite plane as floor :
a good advice : select the layer in the object tree , change the name and then press the Apply button or the Enter key . in the object tree , the new name will be displayed immediately .
the wire model view now also displays the level , al@@ beit at the moment only as a fin@@ ite end@@ ental plane . if you render the scene , the plane expands to the horizon .
when you look at the object tree , you will find that you can un@@ fold the entry for the bottom if you click on the symbol + in front of the object . in this case you will see only the default options for each new object : sc@@ aling , rotation and displacement . select one of these options , change the possible settings in the view of the object properties .
in this scene , you should shift the floor to the exercise a unit under the horizontal line , just to get to know some of these parameters . choose shift and set the values as follows :
first select the floor to adjust its material properties . there are many different materials , but at the moment choose something simple .
in both cases , a dialog opens in which you can select how the object should be inserted . the pigment will then be displayed in the object tree . you can change the name in the property view ( Name = floor pigment ) , with a click on the button preview you see how the pigment looks now .
of course , the pigment preview only shows a matte black material , because you have to re @-@ enter settings for the pigment . therefore , always remember that you can preview the look of materials at any time with a click on preview .
if you don &apos;t see any color on the box and ball in the preview , just click on the Apply button and then enter the preview .
the material for the floor is now set correctly . if you render your image now with a click on the icon , you should get the following result :
of course , this is not the color you expected . here are further settings needed . in the color list you have to enter two new attributes , called Uni@@ coloured . then edit this entry twice ( you can do this more frequently , but the board color list can be used only with two colors ) :
in the object tree , select one color each time and change the colors in the view of the object properties :
you should be able to carry out this step already , since you should have understood the basic working method of &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; the ball is just as easy to create as the floor :
in the view of the object properties you can immediately change the settings . set the value for the radius : on 1 ( Don &apos;t forget to press the Enter key or the Apply button ) , so the ball has contact with the ground . otherwise , the ball would float above the floor as you moved the floor around one unit down@@ wards .
of course the rendering now results in a strange result : as you can see before , the ball surface appears like a matt black material . in the following step , put a suitable material .
if you have selected the ball , you can now assign a material to it . as with the floor , give the ball a pigment as color :
select First sub@@ object and change the name for example in sphere pigment . click on sphere pigment , then select Uni@@ coloured and set the values as follows :
but you can achieve more interesting effects if you take the time to set some finish properties :
then change the values as in the screen@@ shots below and click Apply or press Enter .
the gloss effect and reflection already result in some good visual effects , perfect for glass or chro@@ mium @-@ plated surfaces even if metallic : not even selected :
you should now have a good impression of what possibilities you and k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er offers ; hopefully you have learnt so much that you can create simple but beautiful scenes .
Ray@@ trac@@ y@@ trac@@ ing is a render method to create a two @-@ dimensional image of a three @-@ dimensional scene or model .
if you ra@@ y@@ trac@@ ing a scene , the ren@@ derer shoots hypo@@ the@@ tical rays from the viewer &apos;s perspective ( i.e. from the camera that ren@@ ders the scenes ) through each pixel in the scene . the render comp@@ utes the visual effects of the light sources in the scene and how atmospheric effects such as fog affect .
as you can imagine , you will not see anything without a camera , the camera is your eye with which you look at the scene . without a light source you also see nothing , the picture is simply black . obviously , every scene needs to be rendered , some light sources and at least one camera .
in the usual file dialog , you can select your file . Po@@ v@@ ray files usually have the file extension * .@@ po@@ v or * .@@ in@@ c .
opens a file . in the default file dialog , you can select a file that you previously created with &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ;
whenever you open or create a new model , the file will be inserted into this sub@@ menu and replaces the oldest entry in the list .
if you have already saved the model , it will be stored under the same name . if it is a new file , you must enter a name and disk space .
re@@ stores the scene in the last saved version . all changes since last storage will be dis@@ car@@ ded .
this menu entry can only be selected if you still have un@@ saved changes in the scene .
repeat the last und@@ one command . you can only select this menu entry if you have used Edit Un@@ usual .
saves the current window order and opens a dialog where you can enter a name for a new arrangement or over@@ write an existing arrangement .
in this menu you will find options for the setting of &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; here you can change the appearance , keyboard short@@ cuts and the default behavior .
opens a dialog to change the keyboard short@@ cuts . you can use this option to modify short commands for &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; modify or add new commands .
opens a dialog to set tool bars . you can use this option to add and remove tool symbols for &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er .
a b@@ ump @-@ map is a possibility to simulate rough surfaces without having to model each diff@@ ra@@ ction on the surface individually and without changing the geometric shape of the object itself .
it is common to use the same file for both a dump map and a texture map .
basic bodies are simple geometric shapes that you can use as building blocks : very complex 3D models are produced from dozens or even hundreds of these basic bodies . these models are then further processed to give them a more realistic look .
a texture map is a way to give the surface of an object color on pixel basis , by applying an image file as a color card .
&amp; ku@@ ick@@ Show ; is a comfortable image viewer and browser . the application has a file browser in which you can select images for viewing .
images can be displayed either in a separate window in the size of the image or in full screen mode .
the use of &amp; ku@@ ick@@ show ; is very easy . the file browser lists the files you can use with clicking the &amp; L@@ MB@@ n ; or the Return key .
you can specify whether each image should be displayed in a separate window , or whether all images should always use the same window .
if you are looking for a specific file , simply type the first characters of the fil@@ en@@ ame in the browser window . then a small input field appears in the lower right corner . if a matching fil@@ en@@ ame is found , the file will be highlighted . you can leave the input field by pressing Return or &amp; Es@@ c .
in dialog box set - &amp; ku@@ ick@@ show ; there are five card cards . in three of them , general and editing and slide show , you can set the mode of operation of &amp; ku@@ ick@@ show ; in the two other , short@@ cuts for the display window and short@@ cuts for the browser , the short@@ cuts for the respective windows can be set .
if this is selected , the images are opened in full screen mode . if the image is not large enough to fill the screen , the rest of the display area is filled with the background color , which you can set further down . default is not full screen mode .
if this point is enabled , download &amp; ku@@ ick@@ show ; already the next image in the folder while you still look at the current image . this reduces the delay when you select the next image and is particularly suitable for a slideshow .
with this option saves &amp; ku@@ ick@@ show ; when moving the name of the last opened folder . at the next start opens &amp; ku@@ ick@@ show ; this folder in the browser window .
click on the colored bar to select a background color . this is used to fill the background of the screen in full screen mode . if the window is larger than the image in the window mode , the background will be filled with the selected color .
you can set up &amp; ku@@ ick@@ show ; to set up only some of the file types that can display the program .
this option increases the display window to the full screen for large images . this option is turned on as default .
determine whether the slideshow should begin with the first image in the folder or with the selected image .
to change the value , you can enter a new value in the input field or use the sli@@ der or the small arrows to the right of the input field . the default is 3 seconds .
the number of repeti@@ tions . if this value is set to 0 , the slideshow is repeated until it is canc@@ eled by the user . to change the value , you can enter a new value in the input field or use the sli@@ der or the small arrows to the right of the input field . the default is 1 .
change the keyboard short@@ cuts for the different operating modes of &amp; ku@@ ick@@ show ; in the flash@@ cards quick commands for the display window and short commands for the browser .
with this option , switch between the two @-@ part view of the file system ( a window for the sub@@ folders and a window for the files ) and the one @-@ piece view of the file system with folders and files in a window .

this shows a dialog with a link . if you are using it , your browser will open a page to report problems and wishes . if you use it , your browser will open a page to report problems and wishes . all the information you need is already filled out , and you can simply follow the instructions to submit your message .
&amp; show@@ photo ; is a project that is supported by a community . that means that users and developers can help each other . if you are a common user of &amp; show@@ screen@@ shot , then we would like to encourage you to answer questions from other users . in this mailing list , however , English is spoken , you should be powerful in this language .
the best start to participate in &amp; show@@ screen@@ shot is to join the developer mailing list . how to join the developer mailing list of &amp; show@@ photo ; .
&amp; show@@ photo ; try to give you so much control over his work procedures as possible . there are many options that change the behavior of &amp; show@@ screen@@ .@@ To access these settings , you need to select set up in the Settings show@@ photo ; the settings dialog is divided into eight pages . you can switch between these by clicking on the icons on the left .
in the area of exposure indicators , you can select the color that is displayed when the under@@ - or over@@ exposure indicator is selected . dex@@ ter@@ ity , the colors should be in contrast with what you are supposed to display .
the main window of &amp; show@@ photo ; has a side@@ bar on the right , which provides you with important information and actions on the selected images . you can also find the same side@@ bar in image editing . you can view them by clicking on one of the five riders :
&amp; Ch@@ l@@ ite ; is an application to scan images that do not do more than scan and save images .
&amp; Ch@@ l@@ ite ; is a simple application to scan images that do not do more than scan and save images . &amp; Ch@@ l@@ ite ; can open a dialog to save images or save the images instantly in a specified folder with automatically generated name and format .
you can check the status of the support of your scanner on the SA@@ NE project page by entering the necessary information on this search page : HTTP : / / www.@@ san@@ e @-@ proj@@ ect@@ .org / c@@ gi @-@ bin / dri@@ ver@@ .@@ pl .
a standard scanner can be placed on the command line of &amp; Ch@@ l@@ ite ; with the command chann@@ l@@ ite -@@ d &#91; device name &#93; in the terminal . if this scanner cannot be opened or if no standard scanner is specified , a dialog for selecting the scanner will be opened .
the user can select the scanner to use and press OK to open the scanner .
the other settings contain more detailed options of the driver . &amp; Ch@@ l@@ ite ; ( lib@@ ks@@ ane ) does not handle these options especially .
to scan an image , the user can start a pre @-@ scan and then scan the scan range for the final scan . the preview can be started by the preview button .
to better select the image , the user can zoom into the image and zoom out of the current selection . it can also adjust the zoom in such a way that the complete preview will fit in the window .
if the image has been selected then the final image can be read with the scan button .
if a preview is displayed in the settings before saving , the image will be displayed in a preview window as shown below . if Save is pressed , then the image is saved and Sch@@ lie ? en leads to a demoli@@ tion and you will get back to the main window .
the Settings button opens the dialog of the same name in front of the main window . you can change the most important settings here .
the user can view the image if wished , before saving . in this case , the option must display a preview before saving . if this preview is not desired by the user , the option has to be selected .
this setting allows you to select the way to save images . open dialog to save for each image opens the dialog before each scanned image . if &amp; ch@@ l@@ ite ; automatically save it with a generated name in a previously defined folder , then you need to select Save without asking for a fil@@ en@@ ame .
this setting defines where the images are saved with the Save without asking for a file name . if the images are stored after each scan , then this folder is used as default for the dialog to save . the default value is your home directory and you can change this by pressing the button ...
this parameter defines an image pre@@ fix for the automatically stored images and is also the proposed name for the image in the dialog to save . the automatically saved image gets a num@@ eric suff@@ ix which is up each time a picture is saved . the string # # # is replaced by the numbers .
the user can adjust the image quality used to save . this value also changes the compression value when saving . if select the image quality is not selected , then the default value of Q@@ t is used .
the button Help starts the K@@ DE Help with the &amp; Ch@@ l@@ ite ; manual . the button About starts the K@@ DE via dialog for &amp; Ch@@ l@@ ite ; . the button Settings displays the dialog for the settings and closing can be used to end &amp; channel .

&amp; Amar@@ ok ; use like any other keyboard short@@ cut . below you will find a list of these short@@ cuts and their function . the global keyboard short@@ cuts can be set up by clicking with the right mouse button in the player window and selecting Global keyboard short@@ cuts .
you can set up any available multimedia buttons so that they will work as &amp; Amar@@ ok ; hence , make your keyboard to the &amp; Amar@@ ok ; control center .
the D@@ CO@@ P interface of Amar@@ ok has many common functions , which are mostly found in other K@@ DE programs . this section consists of six parts and is intended to describe the D@@ CO@@ P functions of the collection , context browser , player , playlist , play@@ lists browser and scripts .
Amar@@ ok supports command line options from Q@@ t and &amp; k@@ de ; additionally , Amar@@ ok has some custom command line options .
you should give the user feedback if the script cannot be executed because of a missing dependen@@ cy . please check in your script whether all the required modules are present and use k@@ dialogue to ensure that the user does not know why a script does not work .
begin require &apos; cor@@ und@@ um &apos; Res@@ cue Lo@@ ad@@ Error terror = &apos; cor@@ und@@ um ( K@@ DE bin@@ dings for ruby ) from k@@ de@@ bin@@ dings v@@ 3.4 is required for this script .
in scripts / templates folder , you will find a lot of template scripts in many different languages . you can use them as the basis for your own scripts or simply expand them to the required functions . you will quickly find that writing scripts is relatively simple .
using D@@ CO@@ P your scripts can exchange data with Amar@@ ok and control Amar@@ ok . the easiest way is to use the d@@ co@@ p command , which should be included in any K@@ DE installation .
most scrip@@ ting languages enable the execution of external programs and commands . this is usually done using the ex@@ ec ( ) function . in this way d@@ co@@ p &gt; can be called relatively easily . here is an example in Python :
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; sends noti@@ fications to all running scripts . for this purpose strings are written to the standard input of the script . for this reason , scripts should constantly monitor their default input and react accordingly to events . of course , a script can also ignore the events if there is no use for it .
configure White the script to display the setup dialog . to store and load the setup data , each script must take care of itself . when a script is started , Amar@@ ok sett@@ les the work folder to the folder where all data should be stored .
track@@ Change sign@@ alizes that a new piece is being played . the script could now read more information about the new piece using D@@ CO@@ P functions ( for example , the metadata or the piece length ) .
Volum@@ e@@ Change new@@ Volume signals a change of volume . the new volume is an integ@@ er value between 0 and 100 .
custom@@ Men@@ u@@ Cli@@ cked : sub@@ menu it@@ em@@ Tit@@ le paths includes the path to the selected files of the playlist , when a custom menu item is cli@@ cked . sub@@ menu and it@@ em@@ Tit@@ le will also be passed to allow the script to identify the cli@@ cked entry . to remove an entry you can use d@@ co@@ p Amar@@ ok script remo@@ ve@@ Custom@@ Men@@ u@@ Item ( sub@@ menu it@@ em@@ Tit@@ le ) .
before &amp; Amar@@ ok ; termin@@ ates , or when the user stops a script , sends and Amar@@ ok ; the SI@@ G@@ TER@@ M signal to the script . this signal should be processed in order to do e.g. clearing up data or configuration settings .
Amar@@ o@@ ks script administration can also install script packages that the user has downloaded from a web server . such packages are basically normal T@@ ar archives ( .@@ tar ) , which can optionally also be comp@@ acted with b@@ zip@@ 2 ( .@@ bz@@ 2 ) . we recommend an archive name such as .@@ net@@ .@@ amar@@ ok@@ scrip@@ t.@@ tar@@ .@@ bz@@ 2 , so that the user can clearly recognize the archive as a Amar@@ ok script package .
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; 1.3 will only accept script pack@@ ets with autor@@ ou@@ ting amar@@ ok@@ script . for this reason , you should design@@ ate your script packages right away .
the main script must be exec@@ utable ( + x ) , the remaining modules should not be exec@@ utable . use the T@@ ar parameter -@@ p to get the file permissions :
if your script package is ready , you can add it to www.@@ k@@ de @-@ app@@ s.@@ org and attach the link to the wi@@ ki script page of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; app@@ endi@@ x . for your entry on k@@ de @-@ apps you should use the category Amar@@ ok ; scripts .
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; is an audio player for &amp; k@@ de ; &amp; Amar@@ ok ; has many useful and powerful features , yet is surprisingly easy to use .
with &amp; Amar@@ ok , you can simply drag music to the playlist instead of having to work through endless menus . you may even search for a very specific title from thousands in your collection .
maybe you already have some play@@ lists but can never decide which ones you want to hear ? then the play@@ lists browser is just the right thing for you . and if the decision is still hard , select dynamic mode and the smart play@@ lists automatically select the right music according to certain criteria .
Amar@@ ok has excellent support for Apple &apos;s iPod , i@@ Ri@@ vers i@@ f@@ p and many generic USB devices . in addition , many different audio systems can be used , so that YOU can choose how to listen to your music . Amar@@ ok is intelligent , sexy and chic - just the right one to recre@@ ate your music !
usually you have to enter the following in the root folder of the Amar@@ ok source to compile and install Amar@@ ok :
since &amp; Amar@@ ok , auto@@ conf and autom@@ ake are used , you should not have any problems with comp@@ iling . if you encounter problems , please report them to the &amp; cas@@ ks ; mailing lists .
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; like most applications , has some options to enable or disable at compile time with the configure script . this is a list of available options .
for some of the compile options , certain dependen@@ cies need to be met so that they can be used . for details , see the System Requirements section .
activates Deb@@ ug@@ ging symbols . you have the choice between yes , no and full . if you want to help with the development of &amp; Amar@@ ok , you should use full .
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; can be set up without effort through the setup dialog . the setup dialog has multiple flash@@ cards to set up the different functions of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; .
in the player window , the player window will switch to or from the playlist in addition to the playlist . if the option is off , only the playlist window will be displayed .
use V@@ oting bar@@ ometer : this function is only available if &amp; Amar@@ ok ; with support for mo@@ od@@ bar has been compiled . the option switches the experimental function of the mood bar@@ ometer .
create atmospheric : this function is only available if &amp; Amar@@ ok ; with support for mo@@ od@@ bar , the used color scheme for the mood bar@@ ometer is changed .
store voice files in music files : this feature is only available if &amp; Amar@@ ok ; with support for mo@@ od@@ able . if this setting is enabled , .@@ mood files are stored at the location of the corresponding music files . otherwise , the .@@ mood files are stored in the directory of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; normally ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / Amar@@ ok / mo@@ od@@ bar / ) .
external Browser : lets you choose which browser of &amp; Amar@@ ok should be started when a browser is needed .
use other browsers : here you can specify the path to another browser which is not in the list above .
save Play@@ lists when you exit , save the current playlist automatically when moving &amp; Amar@@ ok ; . enable this option if you don &apos;t want to lose the current playlist when you exit .
relative paths for manually saved play@@ lists : if you enable this setting , use &amp; Amar@@ ok ; relative paths to the music files , starting from the location of the playlist . otherwise , the absolute position of the music files is saved .
the current piece can be seen visi@@ bly when changing the part so that the play@@ lists window will roll up / down to keep the current piece in the visible window area .
when changing the part to the context browser , automatically displays the context browser as soon as the next piece is being played .
in the App@@ ear@@ ance section , you can customize &amp; Amar@@ ok ; the section is divided into three parts .
in the fonts section , you can set the use of different fonts in &amp; Amar@@ ok ; by selecting Property Fields , the otherwise gray shown section is activated . you can select fonts for the following area : playlist windows , player windows and context browser . click Select ... so you can select a desired font from the selection dialog .
using the Custom color scheme , you have the choice of choice and can set your own color scheme . to do this , use the color selection for foreground and background color .
continue playback when starting , that &amp; Amar@@ ok ; after program start playback will automatically continue with the play at the place with which it was stopped at the last end .
setting up the On @-@ Screen display allows you to turn on the O@@ SD . if on @-@ screen display is used , a preview of the O@@ SD is displayed and you can view the effect of all settings in this preview directly .
the first option is the font . click Select ... to select from the dialog the desired font for the O@@ SD . the check box shadows causes the text to be sh@@ aded in the O@@ SD .
using your own colors gives you the possibility to customize the O@@ SD colors for font and background . clicking on the color surfaces opens the dialog for color selection . if attachments are not activated , the default colors will be used .
the Display text input field displays the text displayed in the O@@ SD . by entering plac@@ eholders the O@@ SD can be adjusted to your own needs . below is a list of available plac@@ eholders and what they mean .
the screen option is intended for X@@ iner@@ ama users . this allows you to specify which screen of a multiple monitor environment the O@@ SD should appear .
the map menu audio output lets you select an audio driver from the selection box . some drivers still activate more settings in this card card .
the map collection is used to set up all the settings for your collection . this includes the folder and type of the database for the collection .
here you can select the folders , which &amp; Amar@@ ok ; to search for music files . to include a folder to the collection , select the check box next to its name . this section also includes check boxes to set how to proceed with the selected folders .
Browse sub@@ folders recur@@ sively : this causes &amp; Amar@@ ok ; both the selected as well as their sub@@ folders according to music will be searched .
monitor changes : enables &amp; Amar@@ ok ; to monitor the selected folders on changes ( e.g. , if music files are added or deleted ) . furthermore , incre@@ mental search is performed to make the necessary changes to your collection .
import play@@ lists : causes &amp; Amar@@ ok ; adds all found play@@ lists to your collection folders ( .@@ pl@@ s- and .@@ m@@ 3@@ u files ) to your collection . the automatically added play@@ lists will then appear later in the play@@ lists browser .
the part collection database is used to select a database for the collection . the drop down sel@@ ector driver : lets you choose between SQ@@ Lite or My@@ S@@ q@@ l . if My@@ S@@ q@@ l is selected , additional setup in the My@@ S@@ q@@ l sub@@ window is necessary .
the My@@ S@@ q@@ l configuration section is used to set up the database for &amp; Amar@@ ok ; under calcul@@ ator : will enter the machine on which the My@@ S@@ q@@ l database is located . after that the network port is entered , under which the database is accessible . name : is the database name to which the connection is established .
use User@@ name : and Password : to enter the data needed for connection to the database .
the debit card last@@ .@@ f@@ m addresses the support for last@@ .@@ f@@ m . &amp; Amar@@ ok ; can transmit the names of played pieces to a last@@ .@@ f@@ m server and create music recommendations regarding the current piece if necessary .
here you enter your username and password for your Last@@ .@@ f@@ m profile . if you do not have a profile , you can register one on the last@@ .@@ f@@ m website .
send the played pieces and thus update the profile : this setting allows you to transmit the names of the played pieces to your last@@ .@@ f@@ m profile .
retrieve similar interpre@@ ters : after activating this setting , check the list in context browser . note : you do not need a last@@ .@@ f@@ m profile to use this function .
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; is an audio player for Unix systems ( such as &amp; z@@ b ; Linux ) . for more information , see the summary of the functions and the gallery with screen@@ shots .
Amar@@ ok only needs the package k@@ deli@@ bs and otherwise no other K@@ DE packages . you have to have k@@ deli@@ bs installed ( including the programs included in it , because &amp; Amar@@ ok ; requires some of them to find e.g. modules or scripts ) . we have written a small guide how to make k@@ deli@@ bs minimal .
some functions such as the O@@ SD pres@@ upp@@ ose that your window manager will keep the relevant standards of fre@@ ed@@ esk@@ top@@ .org . Gn@@ ome will work , but flu@@ x@@ box will work for example . we try to support Amar@@ ok on all platforms , so we use k@@ deli@@ bs and Q@@ t because these provide an excellent development environment .
probably one of your files will make an error in the Tag@@ Li@@ b library for days . you can locate the file by checking in ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / Amar@@ ok / collection _ sc@@ an@@ .@@ log . after that , you can report this error to the Tag@@ Li@@ b developer at bu@@ gs@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org and also hang the broken file that caused the crash .
most of the time this is because Tag@@ li@@ b crashes when reading the met@@ a information from this file . please report this bug to the Tag@@ Li@@ b developers at bu@@ gs@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org .
if you use MySQL as a database , try SQ@@ Lite . support for this in &amp; Amar@@ ok ; is a little more mature .
make sure all libraries used by &amp; Amar@@ ok have been compiled with the same comp@@ iler version . if e.g. &amp; Amar@@ ok ; with G@@ CC 3.4 , Tag@@ Li@@ b but compiled with G@@ CC 3.@@ 3.@@ X , this leads to crash when editing Met@@ a information .
if you use K@@ DE with ar@@ ts@@ d then turn off automatically when in@@ active for ... in setting the sound system , or at least do not use a value of 1 second .
you can also send us the back@@ trace via e @-@ mail ( the email will automatically open during a crash ) . if it is a frequent crash and you send us a good back@@ trace , the error will be fixed .
this is because many programs write data as U@@ TF @-@ 8 in the met@@ a information , but do not mark them as Uni@@ code . the following per@@ l script fixes the problem .
# ! / usr / bin / per@@ l the file $ AR@@ GV &#91; 0 &#93; does not exist &quot; unless -@@ f $ AR@@ GV &#91; 0 &#93; ; my $ v@@ 2@@ tag = $ mp@@ 3- &gt; set _ v@@ 2@@ tag ( $ v@@ 2@@ tag = $ v@@ 2@@ tag , amp ; U@@ TF@@ 8 ) ;
this script needs the Perl module MP3 : : M@@ p@@ li@@ b . it can be re@@ installed with this command : Perl -@@ M@@ CP@@ AN -@@ e &apos; install MP3 : : M@@ p@@ li@@ b &apos;
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; s icons in the status bar ( random mode / repeti@@ tion / Dynamic playlist ) are always active in K@@ DE 3.@@ 4.0 . this is a well @-@ known bug in K@@ DE 3.@@ 4.0 . sometimes , the symbol effects are simply forgotten . note that in some cases , you can click on a symbol for up to three times until this setting shows its effect .
if you get this error : amar@@ ok@@ app : symbol look@@ up error : amar@@ ok@@ app : _ Z@@ N@@ 11@@ K@@ System@@ Tra@@ y@@ 9@@ set@@ pixels ER@@ K@@ 7@@ Q@@ Pix@@ map , then check if Amar@@ ok uses the correct Q@@ t library . this can be seen with ld@@ d &apos;@@ which amar@@ ok@@ app &apos; _ BA@@ R _ gre@@ p q@@ t .
to fix this error , you may need to remove any conflic@@ ting Q@@ t version or / etc / ld@@ .@@ so@@ .@@ conf so that Amar@@ ok will find the correct version first .
most installation problems are most easily resolved by the help of an expert in your Unix or Linux distribution . you can also search for help from other users or developers . use the forum and I@@ RC under ir@@ c.@@ fre@@ en@@ ode@@ .net in channel # Amar@@ ok .
Bug@@ z@@ illa is not suitable for help . please enter only one error if you have something to fix a bug in Amar@@ ok yourself .
after starting &amp; Amar@@ ok , only a blank playlist will appear . how do pieces of music come in there ?
this is simple . use the file browser on the left and open the folder you want . then drag the files into the right part of the playlist .
to intui@@ tively maintain the interface , the Start sub@@ window has been converted to the Statistics window . you will find it under Extras Statistics .
the meaning of these symbols has changed with Amar@@ ok 1.4 Fast For@@ ward : stars stand for the evaluation by the user while the points are calculated automatically .
to rate pieces , the valuation column must be displayed in the playlist . click the title bar of the playlist and select column review . click anywhere in the new application column to specify the rating for a piece . you can also use the short commands Windows + &#91; 1 @-@ 5 &#93; . this works even if Amar@@ ok is in the background .
select the files you want to remove and then press Del on your keyboard . or click with the right mouse button on your selection and then select Remove From playlist from the drop @-@ down menu .
drag a playlist file to the playlist and drop it there , just as you would do with other files . that &apos;s how easy it is : - )
in the playlist toolbar , right next to the Add button , you can save the Play@@ list button . click on it .
probably the program x@@ mm@@ s @-@ config is missing . install the x@@ mm@@ s @-@ de@@ vel package and install &amp; Amar@@ ok ; new . also look for lib@@ visual , this package contains many very nice visu@@ ali@@ zations .
the E@@ quali@@ zer is located in the context menu ( accessible via the right mouse button ) . you can also find it using the menu bar under Extras E@@ quali@@ zer ....
no . yes , that &apos;s true ! no ! &amp; Amar@@ ok ; uses a back@@ end independent approach , so the real question must be what media types supports G@@ Stre@@ amer / x@@ ine / Arts / N@@ MM / MAS / K@@ DE@@ mm ? . as you can see , we support almost any imagin@@ able audio format .
it may ! maybe use F@@ ed@@ ora / Red Hat Linux , with which no MP3 deco@@ ders are included in the default ( for patent reasons ) . the solution : Alt @-@ F@@ 2 , gg : Red@@ Hat mp3 k@@ de , enter key
start the Ya@@ ST Online Update and install the &apos; Multimedia option Pack 1 &apos; . so ... &amp; Amar@@ ok ; plays MP3 &apos;s from : - )
if you use the G@@ Stre@@ amer driver with the Al@@ sa sink , the device has to provide a bl@@ ender . a mixer allows multiple applications to use the device at the same time and simultaneously output audio . this can be achieved by a sound card with hardware mixer ( e.g. S@@ B@@ Live ) or through the d@@ mix module for Al@@ sa ( software mixer ) .
the output of this command should help you find the cause and solution . for G@@ Stre@@ amer , you may need to specify a different sink ( e.g. , os@@ s@@ sink ) .
this does &amp; Amar@@ ok ; already . don &apos;t forget that media must first be deco@@ ded . you can &apos;t just send a MP3 to AL@@ SA , you would only listen to a white noise . G@@ Stre@@ amer reads the file , de@@ codes them and sends the PC@@ M data to AL@@ SA . just like X@@ M@@ MS .
X@@ M@@ MS also de@@ codes the data . G@@ Stre@@ amer can output directly to AL@@ SA , just as x@@ ine .
use either the G@@ Stre@@ amer driver ( really great ! ) or optimize the settings of Arts . open control center sound &amp; multimedia sound system . activate sound servers with highest priority ( real @-@ time priority ) and increase the size of the sound buffer ( warning , see next point of the FAQ ! ) . make sure that ar@@ ts@@ wra@@ pper SU@@ ID is set :
K@@ DE 3.@@ 2.@@ x issues problems with K@@ DE@@ X co@@ dec@@ s that can cause disturbed playback . read this bug report . to enlarge the sound buffer in your AL@@ SA setup file .@@ as@@ o@@ und@@ r@@ c can also help .
either you don &apos;t use the Arts driver but instead G@@ Stre@@ amer or x@@ ine , or install K@@ DE multimedia to get the faster Arts Co@@ dec@@ s ( li@@ bar@@ ts _ mp@@ eg@@ li@@ b.@@ so &amp; etc ; ) .
probably use the Arts driver . use another driver ( the x@@ ine driver was strongly optimized for analy@@ zer ) , or decrease the size of the arts buffer in the control center and sound &amp; multimedia , sound system .
G@@ Stre@@ amer installed , but if I want to switch to the G@@ Stre@@ amer driver , crashes &amp; Amar@@ ok ; off . why ?
after installing G@@ Stre@@ amer , you must register all the components . carry out the Registry to register all G@@ Stre@@ amer components .
read the G@@ Stre@@ amer FAQ . if that doesn &apos;t help , you can also ask in the I@@ RC channel # G@@ Stre@@ amer .
try this ( exit Amar@@ ok before ! ) : - Download ff@@ m@@ peg , compile and install it . then run all ff@@ m@@ peg files in the module folder of G@@ Stre@@ amer ( you will find the module folder with the you @-@ config / G@@ Stre@@ amer @-@ config ) and execute the Registry once again . start now &amp; Amar@@ ok ; .
please report this under bu@@ gs@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .@@ or@@ g. if you have a full list of suggestions / wishes , please send it to our mailing list : Amar@@ ok @-@ de@@ vel @ list@@ s.@@ sourc@@ e@@ for@@ ge@@ .net .

thanks to D@@ CO@@ P this is already possible . set an alarm in your calendar program and let this command execute with the alarm : d@@ co@@ p Amar@@ ok player play
this command lets &amp; Amar@@ ok ; start playing . make sure that &amp; Amar@@ ok ; runs before going to bed , then you wake up from the soft tones of music that you have stopped prior to bed .
how to get the current in &amp; Amar@@ ok ; running tracks if you are on another computer ?
if a working SSH environment is present , you can proceed as follows . this command gives you the interpreter and title of the current piece : SSH -@@ i ~ / .@@ s@@ sh / id _ r@@ sa ih@@ re@@ IP d@@ co@@ p --@@ user ih@@ re@@ usable username Amar@@ ok player now@@ Pla@@ ying
replace IP address with your IP and your username with your username . this requires your identification in ~ / .@@ s@@ sh / id _ r@@ sa file .
the visu@@ al@@ is@@ ations can be separated from the &amp; Amar@@ ok ; -@@ windows . press d on the keyboard and the current analy@@ zer opens in an independent window .
the combination of C@@ trl + Right mouse button sets a piece in the click sequence into the queue . pressing the input button after searching in the playlist will play the first search result and reset the search .
OK , the player window and the playlist have tri@@ cky functions , but how does it look with the icon in the system section of the control strip ?
click on the title of a browser . you can select which browser you want to view in the context menu .
my Personal Fol@@ der $ HO@@ ME is on an NFS drive . after the start of Amar@@ ok the collection database cannot be created and many error messages appear on the console . what now ?
the internal SQ@@ Lite database of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; does not work with NFS . either you need ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / Amar@@ ok to link to a local drive , or use Amar@@ o@@ ks MySQL support .
insert the CD , then click Play Audio CD in the menu . it opens a file browser with multiple folders . to normal read@@ out , switch to the wa@@ v folder , select a few pieces and drag it to the desired destination folder in a Kon@@ quer@@ or window . for automatic encoding , take files from folders mp3 or og@@ g instead .

basically , this adju@@ sts the previous evaluation with a dimin@@ ishing value based on how often the play has been played . the more often the play has been played , the less influence each individual assessment has on the overall result .
you can add the rating for a piece yourself by right @-@ clicking on a column heading in the Play@@ list window . then you can change the rating of a piece as well as all other attributes , namely by clicking with the right mouse button on the piece and Edit : select Evaluation or Edit F@@ 2 . you can also edit the rating in the Metad@@ ata dialog .
the developers do not want you to tell you when to release a stable version of Amar@@ ok . this means : K@@ DE packages have a fixed release plan that does not match the short @-@ term plan of Amar@@ ok .
this is a new feature in Amar@@ ok , which some users can also find annoying . disable the option icon when playing and anim@@ ate the general settings .
the Analy@@ zer is part of the toolbar . select Settings to set up Tool@@ bars ... and take the desired changes there .
download a design , or create your own . install this then under Amar@@ ok ... App@@ ear@@ ance Con@@ text browser design , click New Design to install ....
the symbol was similar to the logo of War@@ p Graphics Inc. ( el@@ f@@ qu@@ est@@ .com ) . to avoid difficulties , it was removed .

audio c@@ rob@@ bler is a free service to the information about which pieces are played on an independent server . the service is free and you only need a free username and password . Audi@@ os@@ c@@ rob@@ bler is fully supported by &amp; Amar@@ ok ; supported .
if you want to use AL@@ SA , please use the latest version . old AL@@ SA versions have a lot of crashes and thus also caused a lot of bug reports .
probably was &amp; Amar@@ ok ; compiled before you installed x@@ ine or G@@ Stre@@ amer . therefore , the / configure routine did not compile these output modules . you need to configure and install Amar@@ ok .
now I have &amp; Amar@@ ok ; new installed but the output modules still do not appear . and now ?
you will probably need to install the G@@ Stre@@ amer @-@ de@@ vel package . the same applies to x@@ ine , you have to install x@@ ine @-@ de@@ vel . after that you need to re@@ compile and install Amar@@ ok .
I get the error G@@ Stre@@ amer @-@ CR@@ IT@@ ICA@@ L * * : factory for &apos; Ad@@ der &apos;@@ has no type .. How can I fix this ?
your version of G@@ Stre@@ amer has been compiled with P@@ rel@@ inking , which is in@@ compatible with G@@ Stre@@ amer . you need to compile G@@ Stre@@ amer without P@@ rel@@ inking . a tip from mer@@ lin @-@ t@@ c : do not use L@@ DF@@ LA@@ GS if you compile Amar@@ ok .
I receive the message There is no element present to handle the file &apos;s mim@@ et@@ ype audi@@ a / mp@@ 4 , although the G@@ Stre@@ amer @-@ fa@@ ad module is installed .
in order to play mp@@ 4 or m@@ 4@@ a files with G@@ Stre@@ amer , the G@@ Stre@@ amer @-@ quick@@ time module has to be installed next to the Stre@@ amer fa@@ ad .

I have a second sound card and use AL@@ SA . how can Amar@@ ok use the second sound card ?
setting up the Amar@@ ok settings ... Audio output enter the device . typically , for example , h@@ w : 0 for the default sound card and h@@ w : 1 for the second .
here is an example of ~ / .@@ as@@ o@@ und@@ r@@ c on a machine with an onboard AC@@ 97 co@@ dec and a USB audio device :
p@@ c@@ m.@@ intel@@ 8@@ x@@ 0 { type h@@ w card 0 } p@@ c@@ m.@@ us@@ b @-@ audio { type h@@ w card 0 } p@@ c@@ m.@@ us@@ b @-@ audio { type h@@ w card 0 } p@@ c@@ m.@@ us@@ b @-@ audio { type h@@ w card 1 }
enter the us@@ b @-@ audio in the setup dialog from x@@ ine , and output is done on the USB sound card . so @-@ li@@ b takes care of the conversion of the sample rate , channels and so on ) .
if you want to use a virtual d@@ mix device , de@@ activate the tick on sound card supports m@@ map .
we are sorry , but the audio output with arts is not going to be looked after . you can of course take this problem yourself in your hand ! if you would like you can become the new so much needed supervis@@ or for arts : )
listen to music should be quite simple ! for this reason , there is the Setup Wizard that will appear at the first start of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; if you want to update your collection afterwards , or simply do not like the wizard , this Quick Start Guide will help you . with your help you will have set up &amp; Amar@@ ok ; in a few minutes .
creating a playlist is very easy . drag items from the collection browser to the playlist . the small text field for filtering the collection makes it easy to search for specific pieces . if you are happy with the playlist , you can save them using the Play@@ list button . you will find this button in the playlist window toolbar .
if you have your own play@@ lists , you can add them to the play@@ lists browser . if the playlist is included in the folder of your collection , and you have enabled the option to import play@@ lists , these play@@ lists are already in the tree view . with a right click on a playlist , you will receive different ways to load the playlist .
to play an audio CD , please select Ac@@ tions Audio CD in the menu bar . it opens a file browser with multiple folders and the CD tracks in WAV format . simply drag the wa@@ v files into the playlist and then press the button playback .
the Audio CD function uses the protocol audi@@ oc@@ d : / and is not compatible with all available drivers .
the burning function is also available in the playlist . just click with the right mouse button on an entry and follow the burning menu . you have here various ways to burn a CD .
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; pres@@ upp@@ oses the installation of some software packages . the required packages are listed below . in addition , some additional packages are listed which make work with &amp; Amar@@ ok ; more pleasant .
if you install these packages via a package management system ( e.g. RPM or apt ) , you must also install the development versions of these packages !
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; is a versatile multimedia player . it offers many different ways to keep your music collection under control . like any normal multimedia player also has &amp; Amar@@ ok ; however , a playlist that &apos;s superior to all others . the playlist window contains multiple browsers with which you can capture and browse your entire music collection .
this chapter explains how all the functions of &amp; Amar@@ ok are used , including creating a collection and a playlist .
the Player window is your one click &amp; Amar@@ ok ; Control Center . at the top of the window is a running text display showing the current piece or stream currently running . just below is the area , the playing time , bit rate and sam@@ pl@@ er@@ ate of the current play . a click on this area changes the display of the already expi@@ red play time to the remaining playing time of the play .
in addition , the Player window contains a selection of audio analy@@ zers , including the running text display . you can change by clicking the available Analy@@ zer by clicking the left mouse button on the area .
the &amp; Amar@@ ok ; Analy@@ zer can be separated from the player window . press d on your keyboard and the current analy@@ zer will be displayed in an independent , magni@@ fying window .
the PL and E@@ Q buttons are also displayed under the running text display . the PL button activates or de@@ activates the playlist window while the E@@ Q button is used to set up equ@@ ali@@ zers .
the rest of the player window consists of the playback buttons , the volume control and the play position sli@@ der . use the sli@@ ders to adjust the play position or volume . with the playback buttons , you can start / stop playback and switch to the next or previous piece .
the built @-@ in equ@@ ali@@ zer is simple and works with all audio drivers . there are 17 pres@@ ets , from classic to techn@@ o , and you can easily create your own pres@@ ets .
to view the equ@@ ali@@ zer , use Tools E@@ quali@@ zer from the main menu or click the E@@ Q button in the player window . as soon as you select the E@@ quali@@ zer check box , the equ@@ ali@@ zer is in operation .
the Play@@ list of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; is the most sophisticated playlist of all available for &amp; k@@ de ; available multimedia players . it has many features that do not exist in any other player . but don &apos;t let the wealth of functionality deter them , they are all easy to use .
the play@@ lists window can be divided into two main areas , on the left side is the navigation pane . in the navigation pane , you will find some of the excellent functions of the playlist , such as the context browser . the playlist is easy to use and yet even for advanced users performance strong enough .
context Browser contains three sub @-@ windows : music , Text and Interpre@@ t . these three sub@@ windows will later be explained in detail .
if you have already used earlier versions of &amp; Amar@@ ok , you might notice that the sub@@ window has dropped off . the information presented here is now distributed in other parts of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; in addition , the information can be viewed in the statistics window ( extras statistics ) .
the music sub@@ window displays information about the piece currently running , as well as the artist and the album .
the first area in this sub @-@ window displays information about the piece . in the title is the name of the piece , artist and the album . below you see the cover picture of the album and beside it a Musi@@ c@@ Bra@@ in@@ z symbol . click on this icon to check the piece in the Musi@@ c@@ Bra@@ in@@ z database .
you will find more information about the current piece under the Musi@@ c@@ Bra@@ in@@ z icon . you can see here how often and when the piece was played for the first and last time , as well as its evaluation .
to view cover images in the context browser , the cover images must be in the same folder as the current piece . the file formats .@@ j@@ pg , .@@ j@@ peg , .@@ gi@@ f and .@@ pn@@ g are supported . the context browser will also display covers pictures that are either downloaded with the cover administration or embedded in ID@@ 3@@ v2 tags .
the next section , Recommen@@ ded Pi@@ ec@@ es , lists several recommended pieces . if you click on one of these pieces , it will be played right away .
among the recommended pieces are the favorites of this interpreter . this section shows the five most valued pieces of the current interpreter .
you can specify which information to be displayed in the music sub@@ window . to do so , click with the right mouse button anywhere in the sub@@ window and select from the context menu .
the last section , albums of the artist , lists all the albums of the current interpreter you have in your collection . if you click on an album , it will work out and you will see the content of the album .
you can click on all the pieces in the individual fields to start playing immediately . you can also click on it with the right mouse button and then select one of the options for adding the part or album to the playlist from the context menu .
in the text sub@@ window the downloaded song text is displayed for the current piece . this feature is very flexible and it is possible to download texts from other websites using self @-@ written scripts . as soon as you click on the text sub@@ window , try &amp; Amar@@ ok ; to download the text for the piece from the Internet . if you don &apos;t have a text script yet , you can choose which to start .
the Edit button allows you to edit the lyrics . the modified version is then stored in &amp; Amar@@ ok ; s collection database .
the Search button opens a search on goo@@ gle@@ .com after the song text for the current piece ( in an external browser window ) .
group Interpre@@ t - group only the top level , each piece is displayed directly below the performer . albums or genres are ignored .
group@@ ing Interpre@@ t / Album - First the pieces are sorted according to the artist , and there will be another distribution according to the respective album . if you want to see combinations or sound@@ track albums , this is the best view of your collection - these albums are displayed at the beginning of the list under Various Artists .
group@@ ing Interpre@@ t / Jahr - Album - S@@ ort by artist and then after the year of the album in descending order ( the latest first ) . if the year is unknown for an album , the default 0 - album name is related .
group@@ ing Album - All albums of your collection are displayed alphabe@@ tically by each other . the interpreter will be ignored .
group@@ ing genre / interpreter - your tunes are first sorted by genre and among them by artist .
group@@ ing Genre / Interpre@@ t / Album - This setting works just as the above but is additionally sorted by album below the interpreter .
with the help of the remaining buttons , you can customize and combine the group@@ ing as desired .
with the last button you can change the settings to the collection . note : &amp; Amar@@ ok ; will automatically record your collection as soon as you change something to the selected folders . if you own many pieces , this might take a while .
a search filter is located directly under the toolbar . it beha@@ ves in the list view as well as in the tree view . critics concerning the use of this filter can be found in the section on the playlist in this manual .
there is a selection box under the search filter , with which you can filter the most recently added pieces to your collection . various time windows are available , ranging from the last 24 hours to a year . in addition , you can of course also select your total collection , whereby the filter is practically switched off .
by clicking with the right mouse button on an entry in the collection browser , you will receive the following options .
load - This will empty the current playlist and paste the selected pieces in the currently valid order .
attach to playlist - Add the selected pieces of the current playlist . by double @-@ clicking on an entry you will reach the same effect .
set pieces in queue - This function will add the selected pieces to the queue . this will be played next .
save as a playlist ... - Save the selected pieces as a playlist . you are asked for a name in which the list is to be stored .
transfer to Media Player - Add the pieces to the queue for transfer to the Media Player . see the section about the Media Player Browser for more details .
burn all pieces of this interpreter / Burn to CD - Therefore the selected pieces are sent to K@@ 3@@ b and burned either as a data or audio CD . if K@@ 3@@ b is not installed , this option is not displayed .
edit metadata ( for n pieces ) ... - Open the dialog for piece information and lets you change the tags for one or more pieces .
move files to the folder ... - Open a confirmation dialog . if you confirm this , the selected files will be deleted from your computer .
mark the selection - Select the selected album as a compilation , wher@@ eu@@ pon it appears among various performers .
highlight compilation selection - change a record marked as a compilation album back into a normal album . after that the album is no longer displayed under different performers but again under the respective interpreter .
the play@@ lists browser makes it easy to deal with play@@ lists . among other things , it also includes intelligent play@@ lists .
the lower part of the playlist browser contains the smart play@@ lists . these use &amp; Amar@@ ok ; s built @-@ in database to automatically create some useful play@@ lists at runtime . the smart play@@ lists consist of :
never played : a playlist with pieces in your collection that have never been played .
also created intelligent play@@ lists are possible . click Add Smart play@@ lists to open the dialog to create a new Smart playlist . there you can enter all the necessary criteria for your new playlist .
the Media Player sub@@ window is used for connecting &amp; Amar@@ ok ; using your portable media player ( e.g. iPod ) . to be able to use your iPod with &amp; Amar@@ ok , for example , it must be mounted before starting &amp; Amar@@ ok ; in / m@@ nt / i@@ pod . if &amp; Amar@@ ok ; started , you will find the pieces on your iPod by artist sorted in the top list view of the Media Player browser .
to transfer pieces to your iPod , drag the desired titles from the playlist and let them fall on the performer list . when you &apos;re done , click Apply . thus , the pieces are uploaded to your iPod . when the transfer is completed , finish &amp; Amar@@ ok ; and resolve the drive connection for your iPod .
under the toolbar , there is a search area with which you can search for a file . the search is especially useful in folders with very many files , because in the file list all files that do not match your search criteria .
in the lower part of the file browser is a address bar where you can fetch music from a entered URL . for example , if you enter tar : / home / mi@@ ke / musi@@ .@@ tar@@ .@@ g@@ z and press Enter , you can listen to music in the music .@@ tar@@ .@@ g@@ z file . now you can drag and drop the music from there into the playlist .
if the playlist is longer than in the window , the attachment of files can be difficult by simply dropping down . in this case , the holding of the Shift key can be helpful : this will automatically insert drop @-@ down files at the end of the list and not at the mouse position .
the playlist retains all the pieces attached to you to play . you can change the order by simply dra@@ gging the entries with the mouse to the desired place . as soon as you enter letters there is only the pieces that contain the letters . to reset the filter , press the back button until the text field is empty again .
if you enter by spaces separate search terms , then &amp; Amar@@ ok ; search for entries that contain all search terms . for example , if you enter a two three , search will find all entries that contain one , two and three .
when you enter OR , search for entries that contain either one or the other search term . example : one OR two OR three . in this example , all pieces are found that contain one or two or three ( or a combination thereof ) .
if you want to search for entries that contain spaces , then en@@ close the search term with go@@ ose @-@ feet : Mike Old@@ field . this will look for entries that contain Mike Old@@ field , but not for entries such as Mike J. Old@@ field .
if you specify a particular search column , you can also search for larger or smaller . for example : evaluation : &gt; 50@@ . This is looking for pieces that have a higher rating than 50 .
if you want to search for a piece that does not contain a specific search term , set a minus sign in front of the search term : -@@ something looks for pieces that do not contain something .
you can combine these syntax variants as you like . example : Mike Old@@ field OR score : &gt; 50 -@@ comment : bathroom . this searches for all the pieces that either contain Mike Old@@ field , or a higher rating than 50 and do not include the commentary bath .
you can specify the sequence number of entries by pressing the C@@ trl key , and then click with the right mouse button in the desired sequence on the entries . the entries then receive a marking with a number . the number corresponds to the order in which the pieces are played .
the toolbar of the playlist is located at the bottom of the window . it contains buttons for some functions of the playlist . on the left you will find the Add button to add the playlist to the playlist .
next , follow the buttons back and restore . this allows you to rever@@ t or restore changes to the playlist .
in the center of the tool bar there is a unique , magni@@ fying analy@@ zer . the refresh rate can be set with a click of the right mouse button on the Analy@@ zer .
the last button in the toolbar is menu . it opens the same menu as that which you can view in the player window over the right mouse button . using this menu you can set up &amp; Amar@@ ok ; &apos;s configuration .
there are many more available buttons for the toolbar , such as playback controls and volume control . you can set up the buttons displayed by clicking on the menu and set up toolbar buttons .
the status bar gives you a quick overview of useful information about the playlist . it displays the title of the current piece , the number of pieces and the total play time of all pieces . additionally , the status for random mode and recovery , a sli@@ der for the playback position and the playing time of the current piece is displayed .
you can also hide the status bar . to do this , disable the status bar flag in the general settings .
the context menu can be accessed by clicking with the right mouse button in the player window , or by clicking in the playlist on menu . using this menu , you can reach the settings of &amp; Amar@@ ok .
one click on this entry will open the visualization plug @-@ in window . there you can select the visu@@ ali@@ zations of &amp; Amar@@ ok .
behind this entry there is a sub@@ menu with short@@ cuts to this document and other information about &amp; Amar@@ ok ; .
the cover management is a useful tool for managing your cover images . you can start it by selecting actions cover management in the collection browser .
the cover management contains list view of all albums in your collection . you can view all albums of an interpreter in your collection by selecting the interpreter on the left .
with the View menu , you can choose what to display in the cover management . select :
the queue management received your big move in &amp; Amar@@ ok ; 1.3 . with this function , you have more control over the playlist . after you have set a piece into the queue , the playlist will appear in the playlist . this number represents the order in which &amp; Amar@@ ok ; the pieces will be played : 1 will play first , 2 as second , and so on .
if you want to add a piece to the queue , select the piece in the playlist and then click + . you can also simply add the pieces with the mouse or use the context menu in the playlist . you can then change the order of the pieces in the queue management .
there are three types of dynamic play@@ lists , two of which are already specified ( the details to set up these are later ) .
fill your playlist with random pieces from your entire collection and add other random items during playback .
adds pieces based on load .@@ f@@ m recommendations ( formerly : Audi@@ os@@ c@@ rob@@ bler ) . this mode requires that some pieces are already in your playlist . you don &apos;t need a load .@@ f@@ m profile for this dynamic playlist to work .
double click the desired playlist , drag it to the playlist window or right @-@ click on you and then select Load . this way your current playlist will be replaced by the new one . so you should save the old playlist under circumstances !
the two pre @-@ set modes Rand@@ om Mix and Play@@ lists mix instantly fill your playlist and you can directly start playing . the list of Recommen@@ ded pieces starts with an empty playlist and you will need to add at least one piece from your collection . the recommended pieces will be added at the next piece change , so your playlist will be filled at the end of the first piece .
if you want to keep the current playlist , enable the last possible dynamic mode : settings Dynamic mode . this will use your existing playlist as starting point . using the same menu entry , dynamic mode can be disabled again .
the New Fil@@ ters button fills the current playlist and adds new pieces according to dynamic mode . edit play@@ lists opens the dialog to edit the playlist and you can change the appropriate settings .
right @-@ clicking on a dynamic playlist allows you to click Edit . then the dialog opens to edit the playlist settings .
enter any name for the playlist here . however , the name should be unique to avoid confusion .
if this setting is not active , your playlist will continue to grow , the setting for upcoming tracks will be ski@@ pped and you will not hear any dup@@ lic@@ ates in this playlist . however , if the setting is active , the already played pieces will be removed while resp@@ ecting the settings .
pieces played - this is the number of pieces played that are to be kept at the beginning of the playlist . this allows you to easily see which pieces have been played recently .
this is the number of pieces that should be added to the playlist after each played piece . if you set more than 1 here , the playlist will grow continuously , because only one piece can be played and removed .
the right @-@ hand settings have been described in the previous section . you can select from already existing play@@ lists or smart play@@ lists on the left @-@ hand side of the dialog . if you tick several play@@ lists , you will add random pieces from each of the play@@ lists you check .
some scripts make your own settings possible . you can customize the settings by starting the script and then clicking on it .
you can install new &amp; Amar@@ ok ; install scripts by clicking on the script . it will open a selection dialog where you can select a script package to install . after you have installed the script , a new entry will appear in the list . you can also install new scripts directly from the Internet .
if you no longer wish to use a script , you can delete it . to do so , select the script to be deleted and then click Un@@ install .
if you are looking for information about writing your own scripts , please refer to the section writing scripts .

in this dialog box , you can follow the progress of the copy process . once you have finished reading the original into the image file , you will be asked for an empty CD media to burn the data .
&amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; burns the image file . you need to wait until the complete progress has reached 100 % .
&amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; burns the image file . you need to wait until the complete progress has reached 100 % .
the Q@@ T designer tool U@@ IC may not find the wid@@ get module . to fix this problem start q@@ t@@ config and add $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ RS / li@@ b / k@@ de@@ 3 / plug@@ ins to the search path for libraries ( replace $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ RS through your base folder of &amp; k@@ de ; ) .
the website of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; can be found at www.@@ k@@ 3@@ b@@ .org , where you will receive the latest version of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; you can also get feedback , draw on community help from the forums and learn about news .
if you want to use &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; you need at least &amp; k@@ de ; 3.1 and &amp; Q@@ t ; 3.1 .
&amp; c@@ dr@@ da@@ o ; : this program burns audio or data CD @-@ R@@ s in a run ( also called disk @-@ at @-@ once mode or DA@@ O ) based on a tex@@ tured description of the CD content ( TO@@ C file ) .
&amp; c@@ d@@ record ; / m@@ kis@@ ofs ; : burns all kinds of CD @-@ R@@ s . &amp; c@@ d@@ record ; has all the functions that also provide &amp; c@@ dr@@ da@@ o ; hence sel@@ ects &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; usually automatically &amp; c@@ d@@ record ; however , a higher quality with burned audio CDs .
c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia : a program for reading digital audio data from a CD ( CD@@ DA - Compact Disc Digital Audio ) .
O@@ GG Vor@@ bis Library : O@@ GG Vor@@ bis is a completely open , pat@@ ent@@ less and professional technology for audio encoding and for dealing with audio streams . O@@ GG Vor@@ bis benefits from Open Source and is in direct competition to MP3 . this library is used by O@@ gg Vor@@ bis decoder and encoder modules .
M@@ ad : this is a high @-@ quality MPEG Audio decoder . it currently supports MPEG @-@ 1 , MPEG @-@ 2 and MPEG 2.5 . all three audio layers layer I , Layer II , and Layer III ( e.g. MP3 ) are fully supported . this library is used by the MP3 Decoder module .
l@@ ame : a well developed MP3 decoder that can compete in terms of quality and speed with commercial enco@@ ders . l@@ ame is used by the MP3 encoder module .
FLA@@ C : a free open source co@@ dec for loss@@ less audio compression and de@@ compression . it is used by the FLA@@ C decoder module and the external audio encoder module , so you can read and write FLA@@ C files .
Li@@ bs@@ n@@ d@@ file , ff@@ m@@ peg , FLA@@ C , Mus@@ ep@@ ack Decoder : additional libraries for processing different audio formats . with ff@@ m@@ peg , it is possible for example to dec@@ r@@ yp@@ t WMA files to burn them onto an audio CD . de@@ co
SO@@ X : an auxiliary program that can convert and convert between different audio formats . SO@@ X is used by the SO@@ X Audio En@@ co@@ der module .
Trans@@ code : a command line program for video processing . you will need it if you want to read a DVD .
V@@ C@@ DI@@ ma@@ ger : a feature set fully equipped for editing , dis@@ assembling and analy@@ zing video CDs and super video CDs .
norm@@ alize : this tool is used to adjust the volume of music files to a standard level . this can , for example , be useful for creating mixed CD &apos;s and M@@ p@@ 3 collections ; without norm@@ alize , the different recording levels of the different albums can lead to the un@@ attractive effect that tracks the music pieces differently .
e@@ Mo@@ vi@@ x : this is a very small Linux distribution . it contains the necessary software to run from CD and automatically playback all the videos in the base folder of the CD .
this is a convenient method to rel@@ o@@ ad recently opened projects . the associated sub @-@ menu contains a list of these projects . one click on an entry will open the project .
save the current project . once the project has been saved , the previously created file will be over@@ written , otherwise it will be asked for a new fil@@ en@@ ame .
save the current project under a new fil@@ en@@ ame . K@@ DE &apos;s Dialog Save As is displayed by which you can select folder and file name for the project file .
saves all opened projects . this is the same as if you would call for each single project file Save .
close the current project . if a project has been modified and not yet stored , ask &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; after what should happen . you can then choose between saving and modi@@ fying it . you can also cancel the closing and keep the project open .
close all opened projects . &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; will ask for each un@@ saved project what should happen , as if you had called for each project file closing .
includes all opened projects and finished &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; . for each un@@ saved project is asked what should happen , as if you called File C@@ lose .
when you call this entry , you can select files to add to the project via the appearing dialog . it has the same effect as if you want to move the files directly from the top view into the project view . if the current project is a data CD , the files added will appear in the base folder of the CD .
this dialog is basically the same as the properties dialog of the project . the only difference is the additional button burning , the &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; for burning the medium . the burning dialog can only be opened when the project already contains data .
opens the Properties dialog for the current project . here you can make many project @-@ related settings . each project type has different possible settings , most of them are described via the What is the ? help ( accessible via the right mouse button ) .
this entry only appears in an active data CD / DVD or video DVD project . it causes &amp; k@@ 3@@ b to import files from a previous session into the current project . this is useful if you are not using files for a multi @-@ session CD . it is more useful for you to see the files and folders already present on the media .
this entry appears only for an active data CD / DVD or video DVD project . this function causes &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; to remove imported files from the current project . this function removes any files from the medium , it only removes the previously imported files .
this also allows you to copy a CD to another medium without the project file . alternatively you can only create an image from a CD , which you can then burn later on . you should also prefer cl@@ oning instead of normal copying . you should prefer cl@@ oning if you want to copy CDs with defective sectors or video CDs .
this also allows you to create a copy of a DVD , which you can then burn later on . alternatively , you can also create a copy of a DVD with the help of copying dialogue , so the target medium needs to be large enough to record the entire ( video ) data of the source medium in its original form .
opens the dialog to delete a CD @-@ RW , so you can delete all contents or parts of a CD @-@ RW .
open the dialog to format a DVD . with this dialog you can format a DVD ± R ( W ) , so the content is completely deleted . &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; lets you choose between writing modes over@@ writing and incre@@ mental .
the dialog asks you for a * .@@ is@@ o , * .@@ cue or * .@@ to@@ c file as a data source that can then be burned instantly by pressing the burning button . ( ner@@ os * .@@ n@@ r@@ g files are currently not supported , but you have to use other tools such as N@@ r@@ g@@ 2@@ I@@ so . )
the dialog asks you for a * .@@ is@@ o file as a data source , which can then be burned instantly by pressing the burning button .
a previously loaded DVD video can be converted . this dialog box usually appears after reading a DVD in the content view , but can also be used stand@@ alone . it contains information about the selected video , encoding settings and even possibilities for changing the size and cut off black edges .
displays information about the inserted medium . this information is displayed in the content view and contains properties of the medium , such as size and title length of the CD or DVD .
shows a list of tool@@ bars of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; if an entry is selected , the toolbar is currently visible in the main window .
if this is checked , a small bar is displayed at the bottom of the window . it contains information about the status of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; and its activities . if this is not checked , the status bar is hidden .
the folder view includes an overview of your folders and CD / DVD drives . if the content view is enabled , its contents are displayed in the content view . CD / DVD drives also have a context menu with functions such as media info , locks and unlock the drive or ej@@ ection of the medium .
the content view is also the interface to read and drag files into the project view . the content view is also the interface for reading audio or video CDs if a drive is selected with a corresponding CD / DVD in the folder view .
the header bar is a narrow area that is only visible when the project view contains open projects . the header bar has no real function , it looks pretty and separates the project view clearly from the rest of the views .
this opens a dialog box to change the key assignments for &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; after you have selected one of the available commands in the upper part , you can customize the keyboard short@@ cut for that .
this starts the k@@ 3@@ b ; Setup Wizard . this allows the correct permissions to burn CDs and DVDs . for this , system administrator privileges are required , so you have to enter the password for the system administrator ( root ) when you start the wizard .
opens the settings of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; here general program settings can be made . almost all functions of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; should work immediately . this dialog is intended to person@@ alize and fine @-@ tune the program .
&amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; is , like many other &amp; small ; -@@ applications also , equipped with a &amp; D@@ CO@@ P ; interface . using this interface , parts of the functionality can be controlled via a shell script .
in order to use the &amp; D@@ CO@@ P functions , you can either use the command line program d@@ co@@ p , or the slightly more convenient program K@@ d@@ co@@ p . both programs are identical in the range of functions , so your taste and the type of your task will be decisive , which of the included programs will give you the default .
in this chapter we assume that you use the command line program d@@ co@@ p . to use the &amp; D@@ CO@@ P ; functions , you must first make sure that &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; started . then enter something like the following at the console :
besides the general &amp; D@@ CO@@ P ; functions all &amp; k@@ de ; program have in common , supports &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; mainly two more parts described below .
the standard D@@ CO@@ P interface of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; provides functions such as copy@@ CD , format DVD and other functions for creating new projects .
D@@ CO@@ P@@ Re@@ f cre@@ ate@@ Video CD@@ Project ( ) D@@ CO@@ P@@ Re@@ f cre@@ ate@@ Video CD@@ Project ( ) D@@ CO@@ P@@ Re@@ f cre@@ ate@@ Mo@@ vi@@ x@@ DV@@ D@@ Project ( ) D@@ CO@@ P@@ Re@@ f cre@@ ate@@ Mo@@ vi@@ x@@ DV@@ D@@ Project ( ) D@@ CO@@ P@@ Re@@ f cre@@ ate@@ Mo@@ vi@@ x@@ DV@@ D@@ Project ( ) void version@@ D@@ v@@ d ( ) void bur@@ n@@ C@@ d@@ Image ( ) void bur@@ n@@ D@@ v@@ d@@ Image ( )
as a result of such a cre@@ ate@@ XX@@ X@@ Project method , you get a D@@ CO@@ P reference to the newly created project : D@@ CO@@ P@@ Re@@ f ( k@@ 3@@ b , K@@ 3@@ b@@ Project @-@ 0 ) Altern@@ atively you can create a project using the command line : # k@@ 3@@ b --@@ audi@@ oc@@ d and then a reference to the project by using # d@@ co@@ p k@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b@@ Interface curr@@ ent@@ Project . using this reference it is possible to change the project via K@@ 3@@ b@@ Proj@@ ect@@ Interface .
K@@ 3@@ b offers the above K@@ 3@@ b@@ Proj@@ ect@@ Interface and the powerful K@@ 3@@ b@@ Data@@ Proj@@ ect@@ Interface , which can only be applied to data projects ( CD and DVD ) :
void cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der ( Q@@ string name ) void add@@ Ur@@ l ( Q@@ string path , Q@@ string parent ) void add@@ Ur@@ l ( Q@@ string path ) void ren@@ am@@ e@@ Item ( Q@@ string path , Q@@ String New@@ Name ) void set@@ Volum@@ e@@ ID ( Q@@ string id )
this makes it possible to fill a data project with files and folders from a script . for example , the following script creates a data project , several folders and then inserts files into the new folder :
# ! / bin / bas@@ h PRO@@ J@@ ECT = $ ( d@@ co@@ p k@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b@@ Interface cre@@ ate@@ Data@@ CD@@ Project ) d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ ECT cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der fo@@ o d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ ECT cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der bar / fo@@ o d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ ECT cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der fo@@ o d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ ECT cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der fo@@ o d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ ECT cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der fo@@ o d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ ECT cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der fo@@ o d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ ECT cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der fo@@ o d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ ECT cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der fo@@ o d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ ECT cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der fo@@ o d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ ECT cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der fo@@ o d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ ECT cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der fo@@ o d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ ECT cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der fo@@ o d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ ECT cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der fo@@ o d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ ECT cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der fo@@ o d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ ECT cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der fo@@ o d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ ECT cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der fo@@ o d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ ECT cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der fo@@ o d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ ECT cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der fo@@ o d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ ECT cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der fo@@ o d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ ECT cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@
&amp; k@@ audio@@ creator ; is an audio CD ; -@@ Re@@ aders for &amp; k@@ de ; with it can easily be read and recorded in MP3 or O@@ GG files . also other formats are possible , depending on the encoder that is installed on the computer .
&amp; k@@ audio@@ creator ; is the U@@ I of c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia ( for reading &amp; CD ; data in WAV files on hard disk ) and from many enco@@ ders that encoding these wa@@ v files ( these enco@@ ders must still be installed from the Linux distribution ) . more enco@@ ders can be added to the program ( if they have been installed ) .
first , the titles of the &amp; CD ; read out and saved in WAV files on your computer ( loss@@ less and compressed ) ; and then
in a second step these wa@@ v files ( usually one per title ) are compressed into the MP@@ 3- or O@@ GG format or even in other formats such as loss@@ less FLA@@ C .
for the first step , reading the &amp; CD ; , is used by &amp; k@@ audio@@ creator ; c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia . almost every distribution has compiled a pre @-@ compiled package ; if this is not yet installed , this must be done now .
for the second step l@@ ame ( for MP3 ) , o@@ gg@@ vor@@ bis ( for O@@ GG ) or other enco@@ ders must be installed . all these programs are usually already available for any Linux distri@@ butions , so it is probably not necessary to compile anything yourself .
which encoding / file format should be used ? the chapter Wel@@ cher Ko@@ di@@ erer gives a small introduction about enco@@ ders , audio quality and compression factors .
a word to copy protected audio CD ; s : as already said , used &amp; k@@ audio@@ creator ; c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia for reading audio data from the &amp; CD ; this program is not intended to prevent any copy protection . if not the firmware of the &amp; CD ; / DVD device protects the protection , it is not possible to b@@ ypass any copy protection . simply avoid purchasing copy protected audio CD ; s !
while setting up only once ( the setup dialog can be called up until a suitable configuration is found ) , the daily handling of reading a &amp; CD is explained on the hard disk . this ( hopefully ) leads to understanding the lean approach of the user interface that you will often stum@@ ble at the beginning .
can convert into many formats - depending on which encoding programs are installed ( MP3 , O@@ GG , FLA@@ C &amp; etc ; )
can &amp; CD ; get information from the fre@@ ed@@ b from the Internet or can work completely without a network , with everything recorded manually .
this is just a short list of the main window commands . step by step example , there are more information on how to use this program as well as screen shots with descriptions of tabs for the configuration of the program .
the CD@@ DB requests the CD data according to the setup of request in the CD@@ DB tab . ( this may be local or online , in the latter case first the connection to the Internet must be established . )
start reading and - when an encoder is configured in the encoding settings tab in the setup index - the encoding .
opens a sub@@ menu with a list of available enco@@ ders so that the selection can be read with another encoder as the default . note that previously the encoder is configured in the Settings tab in the Setup dialog .
opens the file manager so that an already read file is selected instead of a complete &amp; CD ; read and code .
opens the setup dialog to configure the type of notification ( like protocols , sp@@ ep@@ sen ) for program events ( such as reading the &amp; CD ; finished ) .
open the main setup dialog by &amp; k@@ audio@@ creator ; with different flash@@ cards ( such as encoder , for setting the encoder ) . here you have to go before the program can be used successfully !
this chapter describes sound quality , encoder and compression ratios and helps you choose the right encoder .
if no audio information is to be lost , a loss@@ less audio format is required . in addition to FLA@@ C there are other like &apos; shor@@ ts &apos; or &apos; monkey &apos; that may be available for this distribution . the disadvantages are the low compression rates and hardly any commercially available devices that can reproduce these files .
among the audio formats that lose information by data compression depending on their psycho@@ acousti@@ cal model , MP3 and O@@ GG may have a slight advantage over MP3 in audio quality at lower bit@@ rates ( up to 128 k@@ bps ) , but above this bit@@ rate differences are less important since both enco@@ ders generate very good audio quality .
O &apos; not so &apos; free , l@@ ame is still supplied with most distri@@ butions for free , but there are open license issues
+ high to very high sound quality ( at high bit@@ rates ) , but slightly lower quality compared to O@@ GG at lower bit@@ rates .
O@@ GG - if only music should be heard from a computer or computer based music system and / or if one of the few existing O@@ GG playback devices is present .
MP3 - if music is also to be listened to on other devices , such as standard DVD players , portable devices ( USB stick , memory card , hard disk ) or special auto stereo systems . today - initially 2009 - these devices mostly support only the MP3 format .
a short list with parameters for audio quality and resulting compression rates for &apos; l@@ ame &apos; ( MP@@ 3@@ s ) ( see &apos; l@@ ame --@@ help &apos; for more parameters ) :
&apos;@@ --@@ pres@@ et medium &apos; = This setting gives good transparency for most people and most music
&apos;@@ --@@ pres@@ et standard &apos; = this setting should usually provide for most people and most music pieces acceptable transparency , and has quite high quality . good enough for hi @-@ fi stereo systems with high quality .
&apos;@@ --@@ pres@@ et extreme &apos; = 224 up to 256 k@@ bps V@@ BR , compression rate up to 6.3 . needs up to 320 k@@ bps for complex music pieces and less for less complex parts of the piece . good enough for hi @-@ fi stereo systems with high quality . this is the preferred choice .
&apos;@@ --@@ pres@@ et extreme -@@ b 256 &apos; = 256 k@@ bps C@@ BR , compression rate about 5.5 . always needs 256 k@@ bps for complex and less complex pieces of a title . some older devices need C@@ BR@@ s . good enough for hi @-@ fi stereo systems with high quality .
&apos;@@ -@@ h &apos; = 128 k@@ bps C@@ BR joint stereo , compression rate approx . 11 128 k@@ bps for all tracks of a song . good enough for music by young@@ sters , portable devices and aut@@ ink@@ e@@ o@@ gies . but not good enough for better hi @-@ fi stereo systems .
&apos;@@ --@@ pres@@ et In@@ san@@ e &apos; = 3@@ 20@@ k@@ bps C@@ BR . this setting will be exagger@@ ated for most people and most environments , but if you absolutely want the absolutely highest quality without regard to the file size , then choose this setting .
the &amp; CD ; information that is entered manually or fet@@ ched by the program automatically from the fre@@ ed@@ b over the Internet is available in the program as a list of parameters . you can commit / used with &amp; k@@ audio@@ creator ; and the encoding program to generate the folder and file name and the properties of the music files .
in connection with encoding programs , there is often a combination of program settings for the encoder and these parameters here . the manual or the help to the enco@@ ders explain the switches for these programs .
e.g. to add the &amp; CD title to the keywords ( English : tag ) if MP@@ 3@@ s are enco@@ ded with l@@ ame , the switch -@@ t@@ t from l@@ ame and the title parameter of &amp; k@@ audio@@ creator ; added . the result looks like this : &apos; ... -@@ t@@ t { title } ... &apos; .
this is a summary of &amp; k@@ audio@@ creator ; parameters that can be used ( = button name in the assistant ) :
this is what the fre@@ ed@@ b is : a free database where people can read the audio CDs , download / enter the information , so that all others can download this information instead of themselves into the computer . it must be noted that here only text is spoken : &amp; CD ; Tit@@ le , Artist , N@@ ames of the pieces &amp; etc ; , not from the audio file itself .
yes , it should be legal , but I ( note of the translator ) bin not attorney . however , no one can prevent you from the &amp; CD ; information released publicly on the &amp; CD ; more or less worth@@ less , so neither the artist nor the music company can be har@@ med . all information can be obtained anyway with a stroll through a &amp; CD ; business , physical or virtual .
in &amp; k@@ audio@@ creator ; is active to select a check box ( sending an address ) . for the use of fre@@ ed@@ b can be used with another ( fake ) address than the one in the system . in this type of configuration , it appears , the email address will not be used when retri@@ eving data from the server ( This can only know the programmer who has checked the code . )
in many countries there are copies of the main database . if &amp; k@@ audio@@ creator ; to use fre@@ ed@@ b , the ge@@ ographi@@ cally closest mirr@@ oring server should be needed . this saves bandwidth in the network and balances the load between the hosts .
a visit to fre@@ ed@@ b@@ .org provides a current list of mirr@@ ored servers for online retri@@ eval of &amp; CD ; information while reading a &amp; CD ; alternatively , the complete database can be downloaded or ( usually created monthly ) only the updates of the database .
which selection program is used to save Pi@@ ec@@ es from the &amp; CD ; in WAV files on my computer ?
there are rum@@ ors that c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia is used ; who wants to know more precisely , search in the source code .... This has always been the best choice for reading audio CDs ; see note that the c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia package must first be installed from the appropriate distribution if this has not happened yet .
to save the read WAV files , the encoder and thus the desired file format can be selected . at first opening there are predefined entries for l@@ ame ( MP@@ 3@@ s ) , og@@ gen@@ c ( O@@ g@@ gs ) and FLA@@ C ( a loss@@ less compression for audio data ) on the tab to set the encoding . other enco@@ ders can be added on this tab .
the encoder package must be installed by the relevant Linux distribution before the encoder can be used . this is also required for the pre @-@ defined enco@@ ders . more information about enco@@ ders can be found in the chapter Wel@@ cher Ko@@ di@@ erer .
after installing a encoder , you can obtain more information about its switches by entering a command like l@@ ame -@@ help or l@@ ame --@@ help in a console window ( eg ; kon@@ sole ) .
this can have many causes . check the device name of the &amp; CD ; / DVD disk , read and write real on it and if both c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia and audio enco@@ ders of your choice ( l@@ ame for MP@@ 3@@ s , og@@ ni@@ c for O@@ g@@ gs , fla@@ c &amp; etc ; ) are installed .
check if you do not want a copy protected audio CD ; check the envelope of the &amp; CD ; this will not succeed !
there is a chapter with a step by step example . even if you use other settings , this can give you tips on how to proceed .
have you read the complete manual , understood everything , but are somehow still unsure what to do ? well , no problem , follow this step @-@ by @-@ step example , and you will get enough information to set up those areas that make the program exactly what you want .
in this example we will start the program for the first time , set up everything and read our first &amp; CD ; we &apos;ll use l@@ ame &apos; --@@ pres@@ et extreme &apos; to generate MP@@ 3@@ s with a V@@ BR ( variable bit@@ rate ) from 224 up to 256 k@@ bps in average and ID@@ 3@@ V1 words ( tags ) .
both programs should be available as pre @-@ compiled packages for your Linux distribution . an appropriate package for l@@ ame can be found , for example , with a search engine since it is considered not completely free software . anyway , it is not necessary to compile the source files , which you can always do .
please make sure that the directory / usr / share / cd exists and that you own write permission ( eg . trying to copy something into it ) .
the first section covers the basic set @-@ up of &amp; k@@ audio@@ creator ; something that is probably only done once and
the second section describes how to read a &amp; CD ; what needs to be repeated for each reading &amp; CD ; it must be repeated .
here we determine the encoder to use for compression of the music ( l@@ ame ) and the audio format ( MP3 ) as well as the resulting sound quality ( --@@ pres@@ et extreme = &gt; V@@ BR 224 up to 256 k@@ bps ) .
although we can change these settings at any time , we will probably not change it every time you read a CD ; change if the appropriate settings are found .
the device name is handed over to the reading program so it can read the &amp; CD ; -@@ data / pieces .
often / dev / c@@ drom is a symbolic link to the actual device name of your drive . if this does not work or if more than one &amp; CD ; / DVD drive is present , a look at the file / etc / f@@ stab and an attempt with the existing entries of the device names for the &amp; CD @-@ ROM ; and / or DVD drives .
the map map General settings . there is not much to do here . here an additional conversion can be defined . in our example , everything will be left as shown in the screen@@ shot .
only select in case of incomplete information , so that you will be informed when information on creating keywords ( tags ) is missing .
the card card CD ; -@@ Settings . simply select both entries . we are comfortable and let the &amp; CD ; automatically download data via the Internet from a fre@@ ed@@ b machine .
note : the computer must be connected to the Internet during the reading of the &amp; CD , so that it can access the fre@@ ed@@ b server .
the second selection field is easier , a &amp; CD ; entry found , starts immediately the reading of the &amp; CD ; this is associated with low risk if you are later dis@@ satisfied with the database entry and the resulting directory name / file name or tag entries , it can be easily changed . the directory name or file name is changed with Con@@ quer@@ or &gt; and the ID@@ 3 tags with K@@ id@@ 3 , the &amp; k@@ de ; Tag@@ ger .
apart from this example , please note : if you want to enter everything manually , de@@ activate the selection fields and fre@@ ed@@ b will not be used . you can work with fre@@ ed@@ b locally in offline mode if you want to download the database before . however , if you want to use fre@@ ed@@ b in offline mode , the two selection fields must be selected , at least the first . the mode is set up on the following card card .
CD@@ DB is for us fre@@ ed@@ b . these are settings for the data request , for calling the &amp; CD ; information from the fre@@ ed@@ b server over the Internet . how does the system know which data to get the CD ? read the section about fre@@ ed@@ b .
mode : we did not download the database , we only want to work with the remote database on the Internet server .
CD@@ DB server : please go to fre@@ ed@@ b@@ .org and look for a mirror server near you . on this way the load is distributed between the hosts . however , this setting will work as the first attempt .
both work in the same way as the server is concerned , but because many fire@@ walls bu@@ ck the protocol 88@@ 80 by default , there may be more luck with the protocol 80 , since the &amp; HTTP protocol is usually open to surf the Internet .
in this example , we do not want to send data to the fre@@ ed@@ b server . de@@ activate the first check box should be enough .
just take the settings from the screen@@ shot . ( make sure the / tmp directory exists on your computer )
number of simultaneously promising pieces : sorry , there is one reason why more than one at the same time with just one existing drive ? parallel reading and coding ? the author does not know , therefore simply try himself .
CD ; after reading the last piece : check this to check the &amp; CD ; at the end of the process .
custom folder for temporary files : if you tick this , then / must be specified the path / folder where the wa@@ v files are stored . if the field is not checked , the files will be created in the private folder . do not forget this folder if you want to do something with the WAV files yourself .
enter everything as it is on the screen@@ shot . the command is a bit long , under certain circumstances something must be smooth@@ ed to the right to see everything .
&apos;@@ --@@ pres@@ et extreme &apos; defines the audio quality of the MP@@ 3@@ s . as mentioned earlier , this is a setting for very good audio quality , even for very good hi @-@ fi stereo systems . the resulting bit@@ rate is about 224 up to 256 k@@ p@@ bs . the achieved compression factor is 6.3 . this is a good balance between audio quality and memory usage .
note the &apos; --@@ id@@ 3@@ v@@ 1 @-@ only &apos; entry for restric@@ ting the generation of tags to version V1 / V@@ 1.@@ 1. &apos; ID@@ 3@@ v2 &apos; tags may also be deleted if necessary . in case of a later change of tags . % f and % o are internal variables for the name of the input file ( including the full path ) and the output file ( including the complete path ) .
use the rest as shown in the screen@@ shot . some comments for future use outside of this example :
number of simultaneously enco@@ ded wa@@ v files : with a dual core or quad@@ core or even a multi@@ processor machine can be attempted to en@@ code more than one WAV file simultaneously .
that &apos;s it , we just finished the basic setup of &amp; k@@ audio@@ creator ; finished . this configuration is used as a standard for each reading of a &amp; CD ; if you have chosen the organizational structure of your music wis@@ ely , you never need to change it again .
this section describes how the process of reading the &amp; CD ; running on the hard disk . we will create MP3 files . the folder structure , the way the music is organized on the hard disk , was described in the previous section and set up . first , a connection to the Internet will be built since we are comfortable and the &amp; CD ; data from the fre@@ ed@@ b will need to be repeated .
since we use a &amp; CD , which is not yet contained in fre@@ ed@@ b , the screen@@ shots look a bit different from the data collected for a CD ; with successfully obtained from fre@@ ed@@ b data . therefore you will learn to enter the &amp; CD ; data manually , rather than pick it from the Internet . comments will point to the differences .
don &apos;t try to find the &amp; CD ; it &apos;s a &apos; special &apos; edition of the author of this manual .
if this has not happened yet , the &amp; CD must now be inserted into the drive defined in the main window .
after a short moment the pieces and their length should be listed in the window , as in the screen@@ shot . this only if the &amp; CD ; as audio CD ; could be identified and read by c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia .
if this is not done , consult the FAQ section for help or go back to the previous section concerning the basic settings .
attention : if the &amp; CD ; successfully obtained by the fre@@ ed@@ b , all tracks are already filled out and the name of the artist and the album will be shown .
in the event that there is more than one entry in the database with the &apos; unique &apos; &amp; CD ; -@@ key for your &amp; CD ; there , a window will be displayed and you can select the database entry that will fit your opinion best to your &amp; CD ;
if you have not selected the check box for automatic retri@@ eval of fre@@ ed@@ b ( on the page &amp; CD ; -@@ Settings in the Settings dialog ) , you can also manually trigger this by selecting the first button in the toolbar . if you do not have a local database , but retrieve the data from the Internet , you need the connection to the Internet .
e 1.2 Step 02 : the CD editor - input of the CD data and the title of the first piece
enter the data for your &amp; CD ; according to the pattern on the next screen shot . the title of the piece in the first line of the input field &apos; Current title &apos; , the rest of the data in the input field &apos; Album &apos; .
the artist no longer has to be entered in the input field &apos; Current title &apos; unless you have a collection of different artists for each piece .
the lower comment field can be used for individual comments to be individual per piece , the commentary box of the album is used for comments that apply together for all pieces of the CD .
attention : after the successful retri@@ eval of the data from the fre@@ ed@@ b the CD editor is not empty , but it already contains the data as shown in the following screen@@ shot . however , it is always a good idea to check the content of the CD editor so that you are not only satisfied with the artist and album name ( e.g. if all words start with capital letters or not ... ) , but also to check if there are any un@@ desirable comments .
note : in this example , we use only ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 1 tags . this limits the length of the fields to 30 characters for the artist , album and title of a piece and only 28 characters for the comment section . if you use ID@@ 3@@ v2 tags , you have unlimited field length , at least on what &amp; k@@ audio@@ creator ; maximum allowed .
you can change the tag information of the generated files at any time using the tag editor . K@@ id@@ 3 is a good tool for MP3 files , with it you can also recre@@ ate ID@@ 3@@ v2 tags .
tags are not supported by all enco@@ ders or file formats . see the help of the encoder to get more information .
simply select an entry that obviously matches the style of the reading CD ; in this example , this is not important since we don &apos;t transmit the &amp; CD data anyway . for more information go to the website of fre@@ ed@@ b@@ .org and read the information about the categories . pop or Ra@@ p for example are to be found under Rock .
after choosing &apos; OK &apos; you come back to the main window . simply click on the line with the second piece .
the window of the CD editor appears again and you see that the fields for the album are already filled with the entered data we have collected for the first piece . simply enter the entries for the fields of the current piece . the title of the piece in any case and other information you wish .
click on the next line in the main window and proceed in the same way until you have entered all the title data of the &amp; CD ;
attention : this window will not appear if you have downloaded the data from the fre@@ ed@@ b . it is already sorted into one of these categories of the database .
it is the third button on the toolbar . note that the artist and the album are displayed above the parts list .
note that there is a check mark in front of each line of a piece . only the titles that are marked in such a way will be read . a simple click on the line switches the selection of the piece on or off . make sure all the pieces are selected , or press the All Pi@@ ec@@ es button at the bottom of the screen to select all the pieces at once .
by clicking on the Select button the selection process is started , this window appears for confirmation . click OK and then we will take a look at the window with the orders and track what is running .
click on the tab order to switch to the job window . it is located in the left upper half of the window , directly below the toolbar buttons .
this is the window for controlling the orders . the first piece is currently read on the hard disk . the status of the program is displayed in the left lower part of the window in the status line .
this error message tells you if you are trying to work with a encoder you have not yet installed . pieces that have not been enco@@ ded successfully are marked with a red &apos; X &apos; in the order list .
by the way , the folder for the T@@ MP file and the destination folder are not what we have entered here in the example . did you check if you have write access to the temporary files and destination folders ? ; - )
now it is clear why the error occurred right after the end of the first piece .
the order 1 reads the first piece , it is finished . but we have a new entry : assignment 4 is the encoding of part 1 into the format MP3 . this means read@@ out and coding in parallel . note the status message in the lower part of the window , it is now improved .
the author of the program has not found any configuration setting to supp@@ ress this behavior . the only thing that seems configurable is the number of parallel processes for reading and coding . for low @-@ performance machines , the result is unclear .
now the last title is read , while another piece is enco@@ ded and a third order in the queue of the encoder . after the last piece is enco@@ ded , a small window with a message for a short time is displayed in the upper left part of the window .
for the successful use of &amp; k@@ audio@@ creator ; , you need &amp; k@@ de ; 3.@@ x@@ . or 4.@@ x and c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia . if you want to generate compressed audio files like MP3 or O@@ GG , you will need the encoder of your choice .
you can download CVS as a part of the k@@ de@@ multimedia package . however , if you are familiar with CVS , you can download from there an anonymous copy . most distri@@ butions , however , already contain a pre @-@ compiled package , since &amp; k@@ audio@@ creator ; a part of an important &amp; sound package . if you read this , you probably have already done it ...
this section is directed to people who compile from source files , not intended for users who use a pre @-@ compiled package of their distribution .
if you are looking for help like the program can be adapted to your needs once it is running , then the following is true for you :
a program that calls a lot of different programs has many different settings . best read the step by step example to get to know the options and settings . it shows screen@@ shots of the different flash@@ cards of the settings and also includes comments for options that are not used in the example .
hello , still reading on ? even if only the help menu was cli@@ cked on after the first start of the program , without any clu@@ e as it should continue from this somehow blank screen ( especially if at the time of program start no audio CD ; in the drive ) , or from an un@@ usually short menu ?
what is it about ? who reads this , probably already started the program . it should look like this :
a bad example : unfortunately no e @-@ mail . the author cannot maintain this manual . it is the first version for a manual on &amp; k@@ audio@@ creator ; thought . whoever wants to add or modify something useful , may it . and if you read this , he has left this section and is therefore in agreement with this suggestion .
strange if you &apos;ve managed to get the source file from &amp; k@@ de ; SV@@ N , then you do not need these information , but ...
&amp; k@@ mid ; is the MI@@ DI@@ - and kar@@ a@@ oke player by &amp; k@@ de ; besides others , he has real @-@ time graphics and kar@@ a@@ oke real @-@ time high@@ lighting of texts also some features that other &amp; UNIX ; -@@ MIDI players have not .
&amp; k@@ mid ; runs under &amp; Linux ; and FreeBSD . it builds on the O@@ SS system , so should work on all systems with O@@ SS and &amp; k@@ de ; &amp; k@@ mid ; also supports the &amp; Linux ; Ul@@ tras@@ ound project driver that is needed for G@@ US maps . Al@@ sa is included as soon as it supports a sequ@@ encer .
&amp; k@@ mid ; displays the lyrics on the screen with changing color , making it easy to follow the piece .
graphical representation of the activity of each MIDI channel by high@@ lighting the pressed keys on the ( virtual ) keyboard .
drag &amp; drop allowing you to drag &amp; drop ; each MIDI file from a &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; window to drag to k@@ mid .
supports both existing standards to store text into MIDI files ( song events or text events ) . k@@ mid automatically determines the process used .
support . when you finish &amp; k@@ de ; during playing a song , k@@ mid will start with the same song next time .
supports external MIDI syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers , AW@@ E , FM and G@@ US cards ( for the latter you need the LU@@ P driver and g@@ us@@ d ) .
first , you can select Open ... from the File menu . it appears the usual file dialog with which help you can select the desired song .
you can also drop a file from a &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; window into the &amp; k@@ mid ; this works also with multiple songs at the same time .
to play a piece of music , open it and press the Play button in the toolbar , select the input from the menu item or press the space bar .
please note that &amp; k@@ mid ; one piece automatically starts once you draw it to the &amp; mid @-@ window . ( with several pieces , they are added to a collection and then played one after the other . )
as soon as &amp; k@@ mid is played , you can jump to any place by using the middle mouse button and go back and forth with the controller .
if you find that a song is played too quickly or too slowly , you can click on the arrows left and right of the template and change the playback speed . to get the original tempo again , double click on the Tem@@ po@@ - LCD .
the space bar has two tasks : when a piece is played , a pressure on the space bar like a pressure on the button pause or selecting the menu entry pause in the menu , interrup@@ ts the playback . press the space bar while no play is played , starts &amp; k@@ mid ; playback .
lyrics can be stored in one piece of music in two ways . some pieces use text event , others use lyrics and other lyrics . some pieces don &apos;t have any text at all : - )
in &amp; k@@ mid , you can set which events are to be displayed and even better : the event type is automatically as@@ cer@@ tained , which a song is used , so you do not have to manually adjust it . so if you activate Automatic text selection in the Settings menu , the kar@@ a@@ oke text will be automatically selected .
if you want to set an event type , select Settings / Properties from the Settings menu . the same function will also have the keys 1 and 2 .
a collection is a list of MIDI files that you can summari@@ ze . these are played in series . in this section you will learn how to use collections efficiently .
to create a collection , first open the collection manager . you can find it in the collection menu under the item Organ@@ ized .... Click on New and enter the name for the collection .
you can also copy an existing collection by clicking on copy and then specifying the name for the new collection . this collection will contain the same songs at the beginning as the original one .
if you have more than one collection , you can set each one in the collection manager .
the temporary collection contains all the songs you don &apos;t want to add to any other collection .
when you leave the application , this collection will not be saved . remember when you add many pieces .
to add songs to a collection , it must be selected in the collection manager . there you can add a song with the Add button . it will in turn appear the file dialog with which help you can select the desired song .
a second method to add a song depends on setting automatic addition to the collection .
when automatic addition to the collection is enabled , a piece is automatically added to the active collection when opening ( using File Open or Drag &amp; Drop ) .
when adding automatic add @-@ on to the collection , the temporary collection will be activated and emp@@ tied when opening a piece . this collection will then be added to the pieces that continue to be opened .
to remove a song from a collection , you need to open the collection manager , select the collection and the desired song and then click Remove .
you can select the order in which the songs are played . if you select the row from the sub@@ menu sequences of the menu collections , the songs are played in the order as they were added to the collection .
when you add or remove songs or select random order in the menu , the order will be re@@ defined .
to play a song , select it in the collection manager , or use the selection list above the kar@@ a@@ oke text .
to continue a song , select the Next song , the next song from the menu item or press the arrow to the right .
to reverse a song to jump back , select the button Previous item , the record Previous pieces from the menu item or press the arrow left .
to delete a collection , open the collection manager , select the collection to be deleted and click the Del@@ ete button .
the temporary collection cannot be deleted . however , this does not matter because it is not stored when leaving &amp; k@@ mid .
this is absolutely necessary for syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers that are not General @-@ MIDI @-@ capable . in this case , the MIDI Map General MIDI events are translated into events that the syn@@ thesizer understands .
for example , you can create a MIDI map that converts all the events of the Change patch to B@@ right Piano type into events of the Change patch to Tr@@ ump@@ et type , making a trumpet sound whenever a piano should originally play .
if you only have a sound card , you do not need a MIDI Map because all sound cards are GM @-@ compatible ( incl . A@@ we and G@@ US cards , FM equipment and so on ) .
unfortunately , there are no programs to create MIDI maps . so you have to edit the corresponding file from your hand ( with your favorite editor ) .
a MIDI Map is a text file that stores all the required implem@@ entations for playing a piece .
each section may only appear once , except the key@@ map section , which may appear as often as desired .
Def@@ ine PAT@@ CH@@ MAP ... EN@@ D Def@@ ine key@@ map &quot; Name of the key@@ map ... &quot; EN@@ D Def@@ ine key@@ map &quot; A more Key@@ map ... EN@@ D Def@@ ine CH@@ AN@@ NE@@ L@@ MAP ... EN@@ D OP@@ TION@@ S ... EN@@ D
you see that Def@@ ine is needed to indicate that a section starts ( except for OP@@ TION@@ S ) and EN@@ D that the end of a section is reached .
please send me your map file as an email so that I can provide support in future versions of &amp; k@@ mid ; support may be for devices that are not General MIDI compatible .
this section shows how General MIDI patches can be m@@ apped to your specific keyboard . general use looks like this :
please note that the left side of the equal sign is ignored . it is assumed that the GM patches exist in the correct order ( from 0 to 127 ) , so you may not change the order and also leave no line for one of the 128 instruments .
the optional All@@ Key@@ s@@ To M is used to lay all the sounds that this instrument needs to lay on the sound with the number M . if your keyboard is not supported for example ( GM @-@ Patch 127 ) , you can take a drum ( e.g. with sound 60 ) , which sounds similar to a gun . add the following into the PAT@@ CH@@ MAP section :
so if a MIDI file is supposed to play a note with patch 127 ( gun shot ) , it takes patch 100 ( the drum on your keyboard ) and plays the sound 60 , no matter what tone is in the MIDI file .
please note that here with the term drum patch the patch is meant , with which each note represents another perc@@ us@@ sion@@ ing instrument ( drum , cy@@ mb@@ al , Mar@@ ac@@ as &amp; etc ; ) and not the one in which the sound means the pitch of the always same drum ( as some key@@ boards possess ) .
the key@@ map section is used to specify how sounds are m@@ apped to a specific channel or instrument . the use is :
as with the PAT@@ CH@@ MAP section , the order of the lines is very important , as well as their presence . so you have to create 128 entries .
you can define several key maps for each channel and instrument . you only have to use different names in the first line .
key@@ maps are mainly used to map sound to the perc@@ ussions channel . take a look at the provided key@@ maps .
this section can be used to map other channels to others . for example , if you want to exchange the first and second channels , simply make it in the CH@@ AN@@ NE@@ L@@ MAP section .
however , these settings are more useful for key@@ boards , which have the percussion on a specific channel ( General MIDI on Channel 10 , others need channels 16 or 9 ) .
MIDI devices need 16 channels , the CH@@ AN@@ NE@@ L@@ MAP section has 16 lines , numbered from 0 to 15 , built according to the following pattern :
n is the channel that is m@@ apped to the channel N . if you use the Key@@ map option , the keyword will be used with the name name for that channel . if you use the For@@ ce@@ Patch option , all events will be ignored which will try to change the patch on that channel . in this case patch x will always be used .
for example , the For@@ ce@@ Patch option can be useful to always use the perc@@ ussions patch on the perc@@ ussions channel .
the value for Pit@@ ch@@ Ben@@ der@@ R@@ atio specifies which ratio Pit@@ ch Ben@@ der events are multiplied . if a MIDI file sends a Pit@@ ch Ben@@ der event with the value n , it will be converted to the n * ( r / 40@@ 96 ) and then re@@ directed . the value 40@@ 96 is used to avoid decim@@ al comm@@ as in the map file .
this setting is needed because GM suggests that a keyboard that receives a pitch @-@ benefit event with the value 40@@ 96 to play a tone higher . unfortunately , however , some key@@ boards try to play two tones up to one oc@@ tave higher . to find the right value on your keyboard , you have to try a bit with &amp; k@@ mid ; around .
to use a MIDI Map , simply open the MIDI Settings dialog . you can find it in the Settings menu , Settings menu .
the channel view is a window with a whole series of key@@ boards ( one for each MIDI channel ) . on these key@@ boards you can see which tones are currently being played .
you can also use the channel view to change the instrument on a specific channel . for each channel there is a selection list where you can select an instrument . if you have changed an instrument , the button doesn &apos;t turn green but red to indicate that no longer the original instrument is used .
the channel view has ( up to now ) two different views to view the played sounds . you can select the view in the Settings menu under the point channel view : settings
the speed LCD shows the speed with which a song is played . the higher the number , the greater the speed .
you can change the tempo of a song . so , for example , if you find a song too fast to follow the text , you can slow it down . to change the tempo , use the arrows left and right of the LCD .
a MIDI file is a file containing information about how a piece of music must be played . it contains notes , rhythm , speed , &amp; etc ; thus , the same MIDI file can lead to very different results on two different devices , just like two different musicians can play the same notes in very different ways .
well , I can &apos;t force anyone , &amp; k@@ mid ; to use . but a typical MIDI file needs about 50 KB while an mp3 file needs 4 MB ( a compression ratio of 1 : 80 ) and with a good syn@@ thesizer gives you a similar sound quality .
this can happen if you have a binary distribution ( rpm , de@@ b ) by &amp; k@@ mid ; this happens because &amp; k@@ mid , compiled without AW@@ E support . to eliminate the problem you need to download and install a source distribution ( for example from k@@ mid ; &apos;s start page )
I want to add a whole folder to a collection , but I don &apos;t want to add all the files separately .
agree , therefore support &amp; k@@ mid ; drag &amp; drop . simply open the folder you want to add in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; , select all the files , and drag them to the &amp; k@@ mid ; window .
first , enable automatic addition to the collection . otherwise , the files will be added to the temporary collection .
you can press the arrow key to the left of the Tem@@ po@@ - LCD to slow playback . to restore the default tempo , you can double click on the LCD .
I have a &amp; k@@ de ; desktop a &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; window with my MIDI folder and &amp; k@@ mid ; on this desktop ( when I play a MIDI file ) or attached ( if I want to play a kar@@ a@@ oke file ) , just switch to the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; change the desired file into the &amp; k@@ mid window ; drag .
if you only want to listen to a file quickly without adding them to a collection , turn the Auto Add to the collection , and the new one ; file will be added to the temporary collection .
suppose you have the MIDI files A.@@ mid , B.@@ mid and C.@@ I.@@ D. First you just want to play the first file . so set the automatic addition to the collection and open it . your temporary collection then contains exactly this one MIDI file .
then decide to play B.@@ mid and C.@@ mid and create a collection of all three files . how do you do that ?
these people sent me MIDI files or post@@ cards . thank you very much ! when I hear these songs or see the postcard , it anim@@ ates me further to &amp; k@@ mid ; to program .
&amp; k@@ mid ; was written by &amp; Antoni@@ o.@@ Lar@@ ro@@ sa@@ .@@ Jim@@ en@@ ez ; from Ma@@ acute ; laga ( Spain ) . I am studying mathematics at the University of Ma@@ acute ; I do not have much spare time for my hob@@ bies but I try to take a little time . as hob@@ bies , I have programming , collecting MIDI files , making music and prove pro@@ positions .
if you want to know where to download MIDI / Kara@@ oke files , if you have a question , an error or an idea for an extension of &amp; k@@ mid ; or if you just want to make me happy , send me an email : lar@@ rosa @ k@@ de@@ .org or ant@@ lar@@ r @ ar@@ rak@@ is@@ .@@ es
if you send me a postcard from your place of residence or a MI@@ DI@@ - / Kara@@ oke file from a local group . if you send me a postcard or a MIDI file , I will en@@ umer@@ ate ( if you want ) . before sending a MIDI file , you should contact me , since I might have the file already .
I have &amp; k@@ mid ; completely written in my spare time and no one gets money for it . I would like to stress that I am only programming because / when I get feedback from users ( post@@ cards or e @-@ mails ) .
Tak@@ ash@@ i I@@ wa@@ i and Joseph H. Büh@@ ler - corrected the defect that the pitch of the AW@@ E cards was too high .
my thanks also goes to Jose L@@ us San@@ che@@ z for testing the CI@@ S support , Ign@@ acio Gar@@ cia for testing the AW@@ E support , H@@ as Pet@@ ter Bi@@ ek@@ er , O@@ la Sig@@ ur@@ dson , Marc Di@@ ef@@ en@@ bruch , Peter Gr@@ it@@ sch , Peter @-@ Paul Witt@@ a , Thor@@ sten Wes@@ thei@@ der , Ulrich Cor@@ des and anyone who sent me a patch , error correction or even a suppor@@ tive email .
and of course my thanks also to all these excellent musicians on the net , who give us these wonderful MI@@ DI@@ - and kar@@ a@@ oke files .
in addition , &amp; k@@ mid can also be found on its homepage , which is located under ht@@ t@@ p : / / www.@@ ar@@ mis@@ is@@ .@@ es / ~ r@@ lar@@ rosa / k@@ mi@@ d.@@ html . on the homepage you can follow the development , search for information and view images . you will also find links to pages with other kar@@ a@@ oke songs , etc ;
a sound card . I recommend you a good sound card or an external syn@@ thesizer , since the sound quality depends essentially on your sound card . it is not the same if you use a FM radio or an AW@@ E card .
if you don &apos;t have a sound card , you need to compile &amp; k@@ mid with the MO@@ DE _ DE@@ MO _ ON@@ LY@@ VIS@@ U@@ AL parameter . it then runs as if you had a sound card except that you can of course not hear any music .
if problems occur , please contact one of the mailing lists or send an error message directly to me .
&amp; S@@ MB ; is a simple interface for M@@ Player , Ph@@ on@@ o and ff@@ m@@ peg . the program is used to play video files from mp3 or phon@@ on supported formats , as well as playback of DVD s , V@@ CD s or TV and camera .
the documentation for &amp; k@@ app@@ name ; was not finished yet as &amp; k@@ de ; on this machine was installed .
for additional help , please check the page The K@@ DE website on new versions , or send the question to The &amp; k@@ de ; user mailing list .
the application window is made of so @-@ called and@@ o@@ ck@@ able windows . there is always the window with the central view . optionally , there is the window with the playlist . and finally , there is an information window that is displayed only when information is returned .
it is possible to save the preferred connections under the book@@ mark menu , but these are individual entries . if you want to create a list of entries that are played after each other , you should use the Category permanent playlist .
of course , you can add groups to groups to receive an additional hierarch@@ ical level . if you select an entry , its group and all its sub@@ groups will be copied to the current category and the playback begins with the cli@@ cked entry .
the categories &apos; Current play &apos; , TV and permanent playlist can also be changed by direct editing of the XML configuration files . of course , you can only do this if &amp; S@@ MB ; not running . to do this simply click on a name of a category , select from the View menu and then the next editing mode . by clicking a sub@@ group , only the XML content of this part is displayed .
after changing XML files , you need to select play@@ lists from the Edit menu and choose either Edit Mode , or select another category .
all changes are lost when the editing mode is left or another group is selected without matching the playlist .
as a result of the author &apos;s convenience , some features can only be turned on by changing the XML configuration files .
the animation during start and end can be disabled by editing ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / k@@ m@@ play@@ er@@ c and Change from &#91; General Options &#93; No In@@ tro = 0 above option to &apos; 1 &apos; . if the option is not present , it can be easily inserted .
it is also possible to activate another animation . &amp; S@@ MB ; will respect the files ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / S@@ Player / FLV / apps / apps / S@@ MEs / ex@@ it@@ .x@@ ml ; the format must be a supported XML file .
the animation at startup doesn &apos;t need to be short , it is automatically terminated by opening another source . however , this would be disturbing at the end @-@ animation , so the user can finish the application a second time .
a simple example of a start animation can be displaying a favorite picture : &amp; lt ; smil@@ ed ; &amp; lt ; im@@ g dur = &quot; in@@ ar &quot; sr@@ c = &quot; file : / / home / K@@ oos / m@@ um@@ .@@ gi@@ f &quot; fit = &quot; meet , &quot; &amp; lt ; / smil@@ gt ; / body@@ gt ; / body@@ gt ; / body@@ gt ; / body@@ gt ; / body@@ gt ; / body@@ gt ; / body@@ gt ; / body@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; / body@@ gt ; / body@@ gt ; / body@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; / body@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; / body@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; / body@@ gt ; / body@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; / body@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; / body@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; / body@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; / body@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; / body@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; / body@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; / body@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; / body@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; / body@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; / body@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; / body@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; / body@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; / body@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; / body@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; / body@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; / body@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; / body@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; / body@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; / body@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; / body@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; / body@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; / body@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; / body@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; / body@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; / body@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; / body@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; / body@@ gt ; &amp; lt ;
there is a tab for configur@@ ing M@@ Player in the configuration dialog from &amp; S@@ Player ; here you can set the path from the M@@ Player and the cache size of the data stream from the network and other things .
another tool for troubleshooting is the &apos; Con@@ sole &apos; button in the toolbar of S@@ MEs . here is the output of m@@ player .
there is no tab for this playback device in the configuration dialog from &amp; S@@ Player ; everything needs to be configured by manual editing of the file ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / k@@ m@@ play@@ er@@ c , just like setting up the back@@ end by mim@@ et@@ ype . here is an example how a &apos; flash &apos; is played with the sw@@ f@@ dec @-@ mo@@ z@@ illa module :
&apos;@@ Flash &apos; can be played inside &amp; S@@ MEs ; even the special field em@@ bed for YouTube can be inserted in the playlist XML .
to allow the &amp; S@@ MB ; &apos; flash &apos; to play in HTML pages , the &amp; S@@ ME needs to be specified as a service provider for the application / x @-@ sho@@ ck@@ wave @-@ flash in the setup dialog file As@@ sets of K@@ DE .
the Kon@@ quer@@ or or &amp; S@@ MB ; is used in a console application and searched for error messages related to loading the browser module library . if there are no errors , the back@@ end output is inside &amp; S@@ MEs ; ( view , console , or console from the context menu ) .
so that a given back@@ end for a particular mim@@ e type is taken ( of course only if this is also determined ) , this must be done by manually changing the file ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / k@@ m@@ play@@ er@@ c . for example , phon@@ on should play all og@@ g files :
&amp; S@@ MB ; can be played by TV cards , either via M@@ Player or X@@ Video ( this needs k@@ x@@ v@@ player ) . before TV can be st@@ owed , the device to be used and the TV channels need to be configured . for this purpose , the scanner can be used from the configuration dialog or the configuration file can be edited manually .
for configur@@ ing V@@ DR ( video data recorder ) settings in the S@@ Player , the dialog in the Settings under - &gt; Qu@@ el@@ le- &gt; V@@ DR@@ - &gt; X@@ Video Port is to be used . there , ports should be detected ( e.g. PAL for West Europe ) , the correct name probably has a dv@@ d included in it .
since V@@ DR support for S@@ MEs can only use X@@ Video , X@@ Video should also work ( probably this type of playing video devices under Linux is the only one that works ) . for this reason , the vide@@ o@@ for@@ lin@@ ux extension must be functional for the X server . therefore , the X@@ Free@@ 86 server must be included in its configuration file ( / etc / X11 / X@@ F@@ 86@@ Con@@ fig ) :
internally , S@@ MEs are used for sources different names . at the time of the creation of this documentation , this is dv@@ d@@ nav@@ al , dv@@ d@@ source , ex@@ it@@ source , intro@@ source , pi@@ p@@ es@@ ource , t@@ v@@ scanner , TV@@ Source , ur@@ l source , v@@ c@@ d@@ source and v@@ d source . if they are activated , they start playing the playlist .
is there any clu@@ e how to make my CD@@ ROM drive qui@@ eter if I play from it ( not from the V@@ CD : / / ) ?
yes , the HD@@ PAR@@ M -@@ E 8 / dev / c@@ drom command can be run as root after the device is mounted . it is absolutely certain that / dev / c@@ drom can be shown on the CD@@ ROM drive .
x@@ ine starts only slowly , why does each time my CPU have to be checked for its performance ?
note : the response is over@@ hau@@ led k@@ x@@ ine@@ player automatically needs the last stored value , only the first time x@@ ine will check the CPU .

G@@ opher has originally started as a distributed campus information system from the University of Minn@@ es@@ ota . G@@ opher makes it possible for the user to access information on G@@ opher servers on the Internet .
G@@ opher allows the user to save the position of a desired information in a book@@ mark . thus , the user can get directly to the information using the book@@ mark without having to browse the entire menu . G@@ opher menus are not standardized , inas@@ much as each G@@ opher server provides certain information .

Q@@ T ; : &amp; Q@@ t ; is a C + + library for creating graphical user interfaces and network support , and is needed for compile &amp; kick .
L@@ ate@@ x ; : a professional writing application . Unix @-@ like systems probably rely on the package &amp; tex@@ live ; or &amp; tet@@ ex ; ( for older systems ) .
most of these components can be included in the used &amp; Linux distribution . for installation , the documentation of the distribution or installation CD / DVD should be used .
the &amp; ki@@ le ; project includes some pre @-@ compiled packages of &amp; ki@@ le ; for various distri@@ butions . these allow easy installation without further comp@@ iling and are included on the ki@@ le ; website .
this manual is for everyone - regardless of experience with &amp; latex ; , &amp; k@@ de ; , &amp; ki@@ le ; or &amp; Linux ; .
advanced users hardly need to read this manual . however , all suggestions for documentation are taken into account . if the support for this project or its documentation is desired , the contact should be made via the ki@@ le ; -@@ website .
if you have questions about or comp@@ iling &amp; ki@@ le ; or if extensions are requested , this should be addressed to the ki@@ le @-@ de@@ vel @ list@@ s.@@ sourc@@ e@@ for@@ ge@@ .net mailing list .
&amp; ki@@ le ; is an integrated &amp; latex ; environment for the &amp; k@@ de ; desktop . &amp; ki@@ le ; provides the ability to use all &amp; latex ; functions in a graphical interface and within this a simple , immediate and tailor @-@ made access to all &amp; latex programs . finally , the easy @-@ to @-@ use wizard , the &amp; latex provides and the powerful project management .
in order to learn more about &amp; k@@ ate ; and to learn its possibilities the manual on K@@ ate should be consul@@ ted . users of &amp; ki@@ le ; can start there directly with reading the chapter work with the editor of &amp; k@@ ate ; start .
for &amp; latex ; is the correct language : l@@ ay @-@ TECH . while the original &amp; tex ; difficult to use , can also use a lay@@ man ( in@@ lay ) &amp; latex ; -@@ mac@@ ros . a less sophisticated but more realistic explanation is that it deri@@ ves from the sur@@ name of Les@@ lie La m@@ port .
while here only a good overview of &amp; latex is given , it is not the ultimate book for it . to master &amp; latex , good books should be used e.g. H. Kop@@ ka / P. W. D@@ aly , A Guide to &amp; latex ; : document Prepar@@ ation for Beg@@ inners and Advanced Users , 3rd Edition , 1999 .
just like other mark@@ up languages includes &amp; latex ; an introduction with which the general properties like paper format , page number@@ ing and text size are specified as well as a body with the text . the introduction contains at least the command \ \ Docum@@ ent@@ class , the body begins with the command \ \ end { document } and must be closed again with the command \ \ end { document } .
the step @-@ by @-@ step wizard from &amp; ki@@ le ; is a useful feature for quick creation of a document in &amp; ki@@ le ; the selection of the wizard ( menu ) offers a few options for the creation of the document . there can also be some settings related to the document .
document classes : this includes the type of document to be created : article ( article ) , book &#91; book &#93; , cover &#91; letter &#93; , article ( DIN ) &#91; sc@@ r@@ re@@ pr@@ t &#93; , report ( DIN ) &#91; sc@@ r@@ re@@ pr@@ t &#93; , projector &#91; projector &#93; , projector &#91; Pro@@ sp@@ er &#93; or user @-@ defined .
encoding : the encoding of the system is set . modern systems are increasingly using the U@@ TF @-@ 8 encoding as standard . at best , U@@ TF @-@ 8@@ X should be used ( for correct processing of the &amp; latex documents ) .
this list contains the most commonly used add @-@ ons for &amp; latex ; for the integration they only need to be selected in the check box .
article ( DIN ) , book ( DIN ) , Report ( DIN ) , L@@ etter ( DIN ) : the document classes of Kom@@ a @-@ Script ( to comply with German DIN regulations ) .
new users do not have to worry about this . it is merely a brief description of the functions and further information is given in the section .
&amp; ki@@ le ; offers - just like other source code editors - the high@@ lighting of the commands , settings and elements ( as well as the in@@ appropriate ) . by &amp; ki@@ le , a simple problem search is possible ( example ) : if you see larger areas of a green text on the screen , it is very prob@@ able that any mathematical environment will not be closed . however , it will save you by high@@ lighting time and effort .
with the automatic completion of the environment , when entering a new command ( e.g. \ \ begin { command } ) of &amp; ki@@ le ; automatically generates an empty line ( for input of the text ) and the corresponding line for closing the command ( e.g. \ \ end { command } ) .
all documents are usually sub@@ divided into some elements . &amp; latex ; allows the sub@@ division of the document into the following elements ( part is the highest and sub@@ paragraph the lowest element ) :
in the view of the document in the structure view , the individual elements can be changed and viewed by a mouse click .
when creating your own &amp; latex files , the return search can be very helpful . as soon as a DVI ; file has been created , boun@@ ces &amp; ki@@ le ; by clicking with the middle mouse button in the DVI ; -@@ viewer to the corresponding line in the &amp; latex ; -@@ source code .
a DVI ; file contains a description of the format@@ ted document and also other information such as the font and is next to PDF the available output ear@@ t by &amp; tex ; or &amp; latex ; there are many tools for viewing , converting and for printing of DVI ; -@@ files for different systems and devices .
when using the summary search , the elements of the DVI ; file are drawn with the editor and as soon as an element in the DVI ; file has been cli@@ cked becomes the corresponding section in the &amp; latex ; the source search is the exact opposite of it . as soon as a section in the &amp; latex is cli@@ cked , the corresponding passage in the DVI ; -@@ viewer is j@@ umped .
master document : this function is used when working with multiple files . with a master document , work with other inserted .@@ tex files is simplified . when using a project , a project @-@ wide master document can be set via project project settings .
express : the &amp; latex ; source code is compiled and the result will be displayed automatically ( if there are no source code errors ) .
file Monitoring : in this mode , the DVI ; file is applied to the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and there is no call from &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ey@@ epi@@ ece &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
when viewing the pane toolbar , the three large selection fields should be con@@ spic@@ uous . the selection boxes were developed for the rapid integration of the document into parts , chapters , sections , ... The available &amp; latex ; commands for sub@@ division are :
the selection box Fur@@ ther is available for items such as keywords , knot@@ ting marks or references . the available possibilities are :
name : with this command , a term for a section , a picture or other element is created .
reference : is used for reference to a specified term ( selection of a selection field possible ) .
at &amp; bi@@ b@@ tex ; this only works if the file belongs to a project . for editing &amp; bi@@ b@@ tex ; -@@ files are appropriate editors . the author has good experiences with &amp; k@@ bi@@ b@@ tex ; and &amp; k@@ bi@@ b ; . the &amp; bi@@ b@@ tex ; -@@ Files can also be written in &amp; ki@@ le ; by hand .
the last selection field with the name Gr@@ Ã ¶ Ã ¶ e is used for defining the font size . it can be specified the font size for the main text , the foot@@ notes , etc . the following fonts are available :
when calling &amp; ki@@ le , two choices are available : 1 . the wizard for creating a new document by selecting the document type and en@@ closing the settings . 2 . the document can be written by hand .
the brackets after the \ \ Docum@@ ent@@ class command contain the settings for the command . the setting &#91; 12@@ pt &#93; specifies the font size . if the font size is not set at the beginning , it can also be changed in the text .
once the above source code example has been entered , the &amp; latex must be compiled ; the easiest way to do this is the use of the building or the button quick construction .
the source code must be stored before comp@@ iling . &amp; ki@@ le ; automatically exec@@ utes the storage .
if the comp@@ iling of the document fails , it should be searched for errors in logging . if you are using quick @-@ construction &amp; ey@@ epi@@ ece ; it should be started automatically . if this is not the case , the logging should also be considered .
an environment ( environment ) is a text that is treated differently from the rest of the document . for example , a report with the font size 12 is created , and only a few columns should have another font . the command \ \ begin { environment } , \ \ Hu@@ ge and \ \ end { environment } will allow the change of the let@@ tering inside the environment to be called &apos; Ries@@ ling &apos; .
the changes are only checked within the environment ( from \ \ begin { environment } to \ \ end { environment } . there is no reduction ( number ) for changes within an environment .
there are many possibilities to increase the legi@@ bility and ease of use of the document . for example , certain fonts , bold pressure , passive pressure , sub@@ st@@ aff@@ ections , etc. can be added . these commands end either with the command \ \ end or automatically at the end of the environment .
\ \ begin { emp@@ h } : this command is for the ital@@ ics and is long until it is closed with a \ \ end { emp@@ h } or another environment . a single word in a set can be itali@@ c represented with \ \ emp@@ h { word } .
\ \ quote : creates a quote in the document . the quote starts with \ \ begin { quot@@ a } and ends with \ \ end { quot@@ a } .
after the background is displayed for writing the source code with the &amp; latex ; mark@@ up language , a step @-@ by @-@ step guide for the creation of a document in &amp; ki@@ le is now followed .
once a bit of text was entered in the wizard , a few adjustments should be made to improve the read@@ ability of the document . for this , a quote , a few digits in the fat and cur@@ sive pressure and a poem can be applied to see the differences between these commands .
once the document has been viewed , the editor @-@ view or C@@ trl e will return to the editor ( in the internal viewer ) . with an external viewer , the window must be closed .
once the DVI file has been created , the document can be printed or converted to a Post@@ Script ; / PDF file . simply try out and have fun .
DVI ; is a common file format ( English D e V ice I n@@ dependent ) . these files are created by &amp; tex ; or &amp; latex ; for read@@ ability of some drivers of the computer . there are many different types of .@@ d@@ vi output such as printer , &amp; Post@@ Script ; / PDF converter or computer screens .
for the printing of a &amp; DVI file , the same steps are necessary as for the creation of the document ( see ) . at the 7th step - after clicking on DVI , the document can then be printed using File Print ( in the viewer ) ( if the printer is set correctly ) .
the toolbar allows the conversion of the DVI ; file into other formats . once the DVI ; file has been created from the &amp; latex ; source code , the conversion into desired other formats can begin using the buttons in the toolbar .
the default search allows the direct jump from the editor to the corresponding position within the DVI ; file .
&amp; ki@@ le ; provides a corresponding setting for all &amp; latex ; -@@ bin@@ dings . for this you just need to set up Modern under Settings Ki@@ le ... Tools Build .
in order to execute the default search , the mouse poin@@ ter must be positioned in a line of the source code and then cli@@ cked on to select preference . the jump to the corresponding position in the DVI ; viewer is then carried out then .
with this function in &amp; ey@@ epi@@ ece ; with a click of the middle mouse button in the DVI ; -@@ document the corresponding &amp; latex ; -@@ document from &amp; ki@@ le ; open and j@@ umped to the corresponding line . for this you need to set &amp; ki@@ le ; in &amp; ey@@ epi@@ ece ; in &amp; ey@@ epi@@ ece ; as text editor ( setting up the ey@@ epi@@ ece ... Editor )
should an error occur when using quick @-@ mount the &amp; DVI ; if there is an error , this will be shown in the logging file or in the message window .
the logging file explains the source code in the source code . in the editor , the kno@@ bs of the previous La@@ Te@@ X errors and N@@ Ã ch@@ ster La@@ Te@@ X errors can be used between the errors . the logging file always specifies the line in which the error appears . to view the er@@ ron@@ eous line , the error in logging must be cli@@ cked and &amp; ki@@ le ; jump to the incorrect line .
once cli@@ cked on the corresponding button in the toolbar , a window will appear to select the template to use for the document . the default options are :
when selecting empty documents , a document can either be re@@ written from scratch or the wizard can be used to quickly create a new document . for more information , see the section .
high @-@ level users of &amp; latex ; usually use the same introduction for virtually all documents . templates can be created in &amp; ki@@ le ; created , saved and loaded to facilitate the creation of a new document .
to create a new template , either an existing &amp; tex ; - / latex ; file must be opened or created a new file . &amp; ki@@ le ; can create a new template by opening an existing document and selecting file template from document ...
when creating a new document from a file new , some strings are replaced by other data ( e.g. name or character encoding ) . these variables can be set up in Settings Ki@@ le ... Settings General .
when creating your own template , it is necessary to know which strings are replaced by which variables :
$ $ DO@@ CU@@ MEN@@ T@@ CLA@@ SS@@ OP@@ TION@@ S $ $ : this string is replaced by entering document class . typically , it is used as follows : \ \ Docum@@ ent@@ class &#91; $ $ DO@@ CU@@ MEN@@ T@@ CLA@@ SS@@ OP@@ TION@@ S $ $ &#93; { article } .
the easiest way to create a template is to use the wizard and the associated command of the commands in the editor . once the document has been created in this way , the following steps have to be executed :
when creating a new document , your own template can then be selected instead of the standard ones .
a template can be created from any and latex files . if a simple way to create a template is used , it should be looked for on the Internet and the steps described below are carried out .
&amp; ki@@ le ; used &amp; c@@ ates ; as an internal editor . &amp; k@@ ate ; is a text editor for program@@ mers with the possibility of reading and high@@ lighting many different types of text files ( including also &amp; latex ; and &amp; bi@@ b@@ tex ; ) . many settings for &amp; k@@ ate ; can be done in menu Tools directly from &amp; ki@@ le ; out .
in order to learn more about &amp; k@@ ate ; and its possibilities to learn the manual of K@@ ate should be consul@@ ted . users of &amp; ki@@ le ; can get there directly with reading the chapter work with the editor of &amp; k@@ ate ; begin .
&amp; ki@@ le ; provides a very practical &amp; natural ; -@@ command reference which can be accessed via the Men@@ tion Help La@@ Te@@ X reference . it contains an outstanding description of nearly all commands that can be found in &amp; latex , and their syntax .
double @-@ clicking on the C@@ trl key to choose the &amp; tex ; this means that in this way , when you click on \ \ par \ \ big@@ skip is only selected as \ \ par .
when dra@@ gging the text with pressed left mouse button , the selected text is automatically copied to the clip@@ board .
when using the arrow keys with pressed Shift key , parts of the source code can be selected in the editor window .
&amp; ki@@ le ; has the possibility to search the most diverse types of source texts and highlight them . for example , the &amp; latex distinguishes itself ; -@@ commands from the normal text and also the mathematical formulas are highlighted by another color .
many assistants can add additional jump marks . this is a special type of book@@ mark within the text . the Men@@ tions Edit Ho@@ ck@@ Charts or the corresponding ke@@ yp@@ ad enable the jump to the next or last jump mark . this is also highlighted so that it is automatically deleted when entering a character .
editing is probably one of the main aspects of using a program such as &amp; ki@@ le ; although &amp; k@@ ate ; already excellent possibilities offered , were added in &amp; ki@@ le ; important functions for writing a &amp; latex ; source code always supported &amp; ki@@ le ; special commands for their selection .
select a complete paragraph ( group of lines that contain a blank line on both sides ) . this extended meaning does not include a text with persistent lines ( as in other text editors ) . this extended meaning includes tables , &amp; latex , commands and all other lines of the source code .
choose the word under the current cursor position . this option also has an extended meaning , since this command also balances &amp; latex ; -@@ commands with a back coefficient ( \ \ ) and an additional star ( * ) at the end .
to delete a part of the document , of course this can be selected first and removed by pressing the Del@@ ete key . &amp; k@@ ate ; offers the key root C@@ trl ; K with which the entire line is removed .
removes a complete paragraph . the definition for a paragraph in &amp; box ; is included in the description to edit selected paragraph .
it has already been clari@@ fied that environments play a central role in &amp; latex ; therefore , &amp; ki@@ le provides ; for additional commands under editing environment for a possible simple work with &amp; latex ; .
with this command you jump to the beginning of the current environment ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cursor is placed directly in front of the command to open the environment .
with this command you jump to the end of the current environment ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cursor is placed directly behind the command to lock the environment .
if the cursor is located before or inside the \ \ begin { area } command , jumps to the end of the environment ( or vice versa ) .
when entering many ne@@ sted environment commands , the survey can quickly be lost . this command will close the most recently opened environment , so that the ne@@ sted environment structure will not be destroyed .
&amp; ki@@ le ; also offers special commands for the &amp; latex groups which are determined by { ... } . under Edi@@ ting Te@@ X group are a few important commands that correspond to those from the Edit environment .
with this command you jump to the beginning of the current group ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cursor is placed directly in front of the gra@@ ceful bracket .
with this command you jump to the end of the current group ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cursor is placed directly behind the cur@@ ly closing cl@@ amps .
if the cursor is in front of or behind the cur@@ ly bracket of a &amp; tex ; -@@ group # , jumps to the other end of the group ( or vice versa ) .
in the input of many ne@@ sted shiel@@ ded groups @-@ par@@ enth@@ eses can be quickly lost over . this command will close the last opened group so that the ne@@ sted structure of the &amp; tex ; groups will not be dis@@ rupted .
in &amp; latex , two simple quotes are used as gardens . for the pur@@ pos@@ eful implementation is used in &amp; ki@@ le ; the character is used for two simple quotes . also for the completion of the application the character is used .
this automatic entry of double quotes can be set up under Settings Ki@@ le ... La@@ Te@@ X can be switched on and off .
you can also use specific settings ( e.g. n@@ au@@ ml or french ) and thus German or French quotes . there are also many other languages available .
when pressing Shift ; Enter key for &amp; kick ; an intelligent line breaks . if the current position is located within a list environment ( e.g. en@@ umer@@ ate or it@@ em@@ ize ) , not only a new@@ line but also the \ \ item command .
close &amp; ki@@ le within a table environment ; the current line with \ \ \ \ with a close line break .
even better - &amp; ki@@ le ; is intelligent enough to support pre @-@ set &amp; latex ; - or custom environments . these can be ki@@ cked under Settings ; Set Up ... La@@ Te@@ X to be added .
some users want to arrange columns in tables environment and thereby all E@@ t characters ( amp ; ) among each other . &amp; ki@@ le ; tries to enable this . when pressing Shift ; Alt ; amp ; searches &amp; ki@@ le ; after the next tab is added , add &amp; kick ; add some space for the column position of the current tab@@ ul@@ ator .
although &amp; k@@ ate ; already offers a good source code completion , it has been added in &amp; ki@@ le ; in order to add special commands ( mostly for &amp; latex ) . three of these work on demand and the other two are for automatic completion . all of these modes can be set for different modes of work under Settings Ki@@ le ... fully customizable .
start a new environment using the \ \ begin { area } command ; automatically add the \ \ end { area } command after an empty line ( for the text ) .
when pressing the back button , the last letter of the input will be removed and it is possible to change the complete list . on the other hand , the list can also be reduced by entering another letter .
all commands are written with a short description of their parameters . alternatively , the descriptions are removed by selecting a command . alternatively , from &amp; ki@@ le ; even ho@@ cks can be inserted , so that an easy jump to these positions can be possible using the Edit Domain N@@ Ã ch@@ est jump mark and then the desired parameters can then be added .
under Settings box ; set up ... ki@@ le ; complete can be made to these lists . there can be various wishes lists for &amp; tex ; - and &amp; latex ; -@@ commands as well as wishes of the general language use .
the command mode is not useful for the completion of environments . there must always be a few letters with \ \ begin to be entered and the call to complete mode will result in a large list of environment commands . on the other hand , the environments are used so often that &amp; ki@@ le ; a special mode for the completion of the environments available .
when calling the completed environment or the Alt + Shift key , the command to open the environment is automatically opened and it will appear \ \ begin . after that , the environment can be continued in the simplest way and ended by pressing the input key .
once this has been done , the environment is automatically closed again . as soon as &amp; ki@@ le ; recognize that it is a list environment , even a first \ \ item command will be added .
under Settings box ; set up ... ki@@ le ; complete settings can be made to these lists . this mode uses the list of disable mode for &amp; tex ; - and &amp; latex ; -@@ commands .
&amp; ki@@ le ; supports custom lists of abbrevi@@ ations which are immediately replaced by longer strings . the lists can be set up under Settings Ki@@ le ... Ki@@ le can be executed fully . as an example of a query list , the file ex@@ amp@@ le.@@ c@@ w@@ l , in which for example the entry L = \ \ La@@ Te@@ X is included .
for example , the letter L is entered and the word processor mode implemented over the menu processing or pressing C@@ trl + Alt key @-@ key , the letter L is replaced by the character string \ \ La@@ Te@@ X .
large qu@@ ests are not helpful for automatic completion . however , it has been found that many users are written more than once in a document . thus , &amp; ki@@ le offers ; the complete termination for all already written wishes .
this mode can be set up in the box Settings Ki@@ le ... Ki@@ le can be dep@@ rec@@ ated . here , the tres@@ hold for the display of the complete damage can also be specified .
the complete files can be installed in the ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / ki@@ le / complete / mode / the Persian home folder . mode stands for Ab@@ brevi@@ ation , Dictionary ( W@@ Ã ¶ r@@ ter@@ buch ) or tex .
the graphics capture graphics make it as easy as possible to insert graphics . to view the basics of graphic formats , the sections should be considered .
PS files are not as well known as PDF files but provide an excellent basis for changes and new orders of pages . if the PDF output is required , the pages can be re@@ arranged with a few &amp; Post@@ Script ; tools and then converted to a PDF file with ps@@ 2@@ pdf .
in order to examine the results of the work , the source code must be compiled . all construction tools are compiled in groups in the menu Create comp@@ iling , converting and creating views .
for comp@@ iling the source text for viewers such as &amp; ey@@ epi@@ ece ; or the further conversion can be used the key element Alt ; 2 . afterwards , the DVI ; file can be viewed in the default viewer by Alt ; 3 , by means of Alt ; 4 the DVI ; file can be converted to a PS file and viewed by Alt ; 5 the PS file .
when using the Schnell@@ bau command , a viewer is normally called after comp@@ iling . if no embedded viewer is used , a new window will be opened each time .
a new project will be discussed about the Project New Project .... In this case the following information is requested for the project :
when exec@@ uting the fil@@ en@@ ame window , the relative path must be specified by the .@@ kil@@ e@@ r project file .
the script function of &amp; ki@@ le ; allows exec@@ uting EC@@ MA@@ Script codes . scripts can be managed through scripts in the vertical bar .
the API scripts are not yet developed and can be modified in other versions of &amp; ki@@ le .
first , it must be said that the execution environment of the scripts in &amp; ki@@ le ; a system @-@ wide object ( = ki@@ le ) with the following methods has :
&amp; latex ; is a fairly declared system in which the basic functions can be extended by a variety of additional packages . &amp; ki@@ le ; offers a lot of different help to support the users .
&amp; tet@@ ex ; and &amp; tex@@ live ; are supplied with many documents . this includes a documentation for the included packages and an additional &amp; latex ; -@@ reference .
a complete Ref@@ ern@@ z for &amp; tex ; and its name @-@ to @-@ your@@ name . it is not just a description of all programs ( but a few important pack@@ ets are described ) but rather is a complete instruction manual for the &amp; latex ; this is a very large document , it is divided into three important book@@ marks .
due to the quantity of documents with which &amp; tet@@ ex ; / tex@@ live ; delivered , finding the right document is not always easy . as possible help offers &amp; tet@@ ex ; / tex@@ live ; the small application text doc@@ t@@ k , which contains a database with all documents and for a graphical surface area .
all documents are divided into categories and the great advantage is the search for package names or keywords .
double @-@ clicking with the mouse or pressing the space bar opens the viewer for the document .
&amp; ki@@ le ; is a qu@@ el@@ lo@@ ff and user @-@ friendly &amp; latex ; - / tex ; -@@ Source editor that can be executed on all systems with installed &amp; k@@ de ; - and Unix @-@ like systems . &amp; ki@@ le ; is also part of the Fink project , whereby &amp; ki@@ le ; also on &amp; Mac ; with installed OS X can be executed .
many thanks to those who wish to continue the &amp; kick project and offer for many hours for the development of tools we can use all in consideration of the &amp; GNU ; license . up @-@ to @-@ date information on the contribut@@ ors are available in the menu above &amp; ki@@ le ; .

&amp; k@@ sig ; is a graphical editor to manage many different signatures for e @-@ mails . the signatures edit you in the graphical user interface of &amp; k@@ sig ; with the command @-@ line interface you create random signatures or day signatures from a list . this command @-@ line interface provides signatures for external email programs such as &amp; k@@ mail ; .
for random signatures , any signature is made from the signature file of &amp; k@@ sig ; read out . through many signatures with different quotes , styles and information , you can create your emails varied and unique .
for day signatures all day the same signature is from the signature file of &amp; k@@ sig ; read out . for each day , you use different signatures , as with the random signatures you create unique emails .
to create a new signature , select C@@ trl ; N file New . this will give you one ; empty signature ; in the signature code . click on the &amp; lt ; empty signature ; and paste it with C@@ trl ; S file Save or click the Save icon .
you can create as many signatures as you like . then you have a list of signatures for e @-@ mail programs such as &amp; k@@ mail ; whether you use e @-@ mails privately or professionally , there are always enough signatures .
to delete a signature select it first and then in the File menu Remove or click the icon with the red cross removal in the toolbar .
open the short@@ cut dialog . here you can select short@@ cuts for menu entries . to change a short command , select an action from the list . then click the user defined button at the bottom right corner and enter the new short@@ cut by pressing the key or key combination .
for use of &amp; K@@ sig ; is &amp; k@@ de ; 3.5 is required . to attach signatures to your e @-@ mails , you need a program such as &amp; k@@ mail ; or another program that can insert the signature text from the output of a command .

version 3.2 of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; contains many new &amp; XML ; tools and functions . these tools are unique in their integration in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; all these tools are unique in their integration in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; all these tools use Kom@@ ger@@ as surface and lib@@ x@@ m@@ l@@ 2 and lib@@ x@@ s@@ lt as a base . the combination results in fast , efficient , complete and productive tools .
everyone who worked with the &amp; K@@ de ; documentation , knows my opinion and how outstanding it is . if we raise it a bit , we give it a graphical interface ! no longer dependent on a terminal ; simply cli@@ cked on the symbol for the XML processor and done !
this application requires inde@@ x.@@ doc@@ book in the folder . if inde@@ x.@@ doc@@ book is in the intended work folder , then leave the current working folder . if not , then remove the selection of current work folders and specify the folder you want in the field of other folders .
output files are stored in the same folder as the source files . all previous &amp; HTML ; files will be deleted every time they are started .
as already said , everyone who has worked on the &amp; de ; documentation already worked knows how helpful this application is . and with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; there is now a great graphical interface for it .
if the newly opened file is inde@@ x.@@ doc@@ book , then simply select the current working folder . if not , then select the current working folder and enter the folder where inde@@ x.@@ doc@@ book is to be found .
if it comes to an output on the screen , your file is er@@ ron@@ eous . please check the reported short@@ com@@ ings and try again .
if the file to be checked is already selected in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us , then the current file is simply cli@@ cked . if not , delete the tick at current file and select the file to be checked by other file - file sel@@ ector .
if you only want to know if the well @-@ formed file is well formed , click the Well @-@ formed check selection .
for use of a &amp; D@@ TD , specified in the &amp; XML ; file , select &amp; D@@ TD ; ( External ) , otherwise &amp; D@@ TD ; ( External ) and specify the location of the &amp; D@@ TD ; by definition UR@@ I ; schema as well as for the Relax@@ NG check is the definition of the definition UR@@ I ; in the file selection is required .
yes , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; also has a &amp; X@@ SL ; -@@ processing tool ! this uses the x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c tool from the lib@@ x@@ m@@ l@@ 2 library .
should the file to be processed in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; already selected , then the current file is simply selected . if not , remove the file and select the file to be processed by the other file sel@@ ector .
specify the name of the file as the result should have named . the file is usually stored in your home folder .
the plug @-@ ins , the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; la@@ ths , have with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; even possibly little to do . this makes the plugin system very powerful . you can benefit from additional functionality immediately and do not have to wait until someone is plug@@ ging in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; plug@@ ins can be used in a large number of &amp; GUI elements .
to install a plugin or a part , we start with the Edit menu . this will open the following dialog :
this dialog allows you to manage all contained plug @-@ ins and add new ones . we describe each &amp; GUI ; element in it :
here you can enter the search path . when adding plug@@ ins without a storage location uses &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; this path to search the plug @-@ in .
often on a project several people work in a kind of hierarch@@ ical relationship to each other . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; supports the specification of team members and these can be configured with Shift ; F@@ 7 Project Project Properties dialog .
the name and email entries are self @-@ explan@@ atory . nick@@ name is the nick@@ name of the user and is used for unique identification .
a member can have several roles in the project , such as team leaders and sub @-@ project leaders .
the user can choose from the list of team members who he is . this happens by searching the team member from the list and pus@@ hes the S@@ etze + button . the currently selected member ( their identity ) appears bold after you are : text .
nick@@ names and the attitude of their own identity are important in terms of messages and comments . see for further information on ann@@ ot@@ ations .
in addition to an overview of their team there is another advantage by cap@@ turing members of the team : an event can be created for information to the team leader when something is happening . see for more information .
event actions are actions that are executed when something specific happens in the project . an example would be recording the opening and closing of the project , so that later can be seen how much someone worked on it , or sending a message when a file is backed up , or a script that enters a file into CVS once it is added to the project &amp; etc ;
on the page Event configuration of the Shift ; F@@ 7 Project Project Settings dialog , events can be created , edited and deleted .
an email will be sent to the add@@ res@@ see in the recipient list . the add@@ res@@ see may be a team or sub @-@ project leader .
notes are special comments in the documents . they differ from normal comments by the following :
enter comments is simple . it can either select the note entry from the editor context menu or enter the @ ann@@ ot@@ ation keyword in a comment field followed by comment text .
notes can be sent to a certain member of the team . in this case , the syntax @ ann@@ ot@@ ation ( nick@@ name ) or @ ann@@ ot@@ ation ( role ) is a role in the project from the following options : team Leader Sub@@ project Leader after the area and sub @-@ project leaders should be given the corresponding range or sub@@ project names , as shown in the following examples below .
nick@@ names and roles names are independent of upper or lower case , but spaces around the cl@@ amps and the : make the note invalid .
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; is a development environment for script and format@@ ting languages , which is D@@ TD @-@ agnos@@ tic and supports web @-@ based format@@ ting and scrip@@ ting languages .
the settings are accessible via the Settings menu . here only via &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; -@@ specific settings are treated , a short description for the other can be found in .
the settings can be set up using the Qu@@ anta settings ... This dialog extends over some pages that are treated one after the other .
the behavior of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; regarding tags , including car completion , can be changed with this . the entries are :
large / lower@@ case of tags : large / lower@@ case of automatically inserted tags . normal sized / lower@@ case means tags are inserted in such a way as they are described in the tag XML files .
large / lower@@ case of attributes : large / lower@@ case of automatically inserted attributes . normal sized / lower@@ case means the attributes are inserted in such a way as described in the tag@@ XML files .
optional Tags : if checked , tags for which the closing tag is optional , will be added immediately after &amp; gt ;
do not include optional tags : as above , for all other tags with the exception of simple tags .
update start and end day automatically : if enabled , the corresponding closing tag will be changed and vice versa .
automatic setting of acc@@ ent characters : controls the automatic conversion of acc@@ ented characters into the corresponding coding during typing .
MI@@ ME types : mim@@ et@@ yp@@ es for detection of different types of files . the default setting can be restored using the Standard button .
default character encoding : the encoding of newly created or otherwise opened files ( where the encoding of the file can be ski@@ pped ) . however , this setting here will be ej@@ ected from the same in the project features if a project is loaded .
standard D@@ TD : the selected D@@ TD is used for newly created files , or for files whose D@@ TD has not been detected . however , this setting here will be dropped by the same in the project properties if a project is loaded .
create a backup copy : &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; creates backup copies regularly so that during a power failure or crash , the document can be recovered from this backup at the next start of the program . this is not the same as saving the file . also for un@@ saved documents a backup will be created regularly , according to the set time .
the preview and documentation can be displayed either in the Editor area or in your own view ( or the documentation in a tab ) , making it possible to preview the documentation , preview and source text at the same time .
reset the window settings to the default at the next start is useful when the user interface has been mess@@ ed up by changing the M@@ DI modes and do@@ cking / app@@ ending of views . it corresponds to the --@@ res@@ et@@ layout command line parameter .
the alert notification area is used to control the display of warnings by enabling no more questions .
the location to change behavior of &amp; V@@ PL ; it can be set the display of symbols instead of scripts as well as the synchronization behavior of the V@@ PL@@ - and the source text view in split mode .
here the par@@ ser and the structure tree , representing the illustration of the par@@ ser nodes in the document , can be adjusted in detail .
in the mouse click on the structure tree , the following action is possible to change the action triggered by clicking the structure tree with the mouse buttons .
in the Struc@@ tural Tree Settings section , the visibility of nodes in the tree , the updating frequency of the tree when editing and how deeply should be opened automatically with a change in the structure tree . empty nodes are the empty areas in the text , while empty groups are those in which no element has been found in the current document .
abbrevi@@ ations are divided into groups , each can be valid for several &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; s . this means that there can be a valid group for PHP , in which the i@@ f@@ clause short@@ cut means something else than in a group valid for Javascript .
plug@@ ins are part @-@ applications from third parties , which can be re @-@ used by any part @-@ capable application , the most known &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; when inser@@ ting a plug @-@ in , the following must be specified :
address : the path to the plugin if it is not on a standard like $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / li@@ b .
input : this information is passed to the plugin at startup , so it can open the current file , the corresponding folder ( path of the current file ) or the project folder .
load the component in the &quot; read @-@ only &quot; mode : check if the plugin refuses to load the load . only @-@ Read @-@ K@@ Parts normally refuse loading if this option is not selected .
check the plugin : if this is activated , test &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; if the entered information is correct . choose to save the entry even if the plugin is not available at the moment , but it should be installed later .
for &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; as of version 3.3 , debu@@ gging has been completely re@@ developed . support for the no more necessary built @-@ in &amp; PHP ; ( 3 ) debu@@ gger has been set , as well as support for the DB@@ G debu@@ gger . instead , a debu@@ gger plug @-@ in concept has been implemented that allows different implem@@ entations about plug @-@ ins .
currently , only one plugin is available , support for the use of &amp; gu@@ bed ; inqu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; inserts .
the use of the debu@@ gger for a project starts with the selection of a suitable debu@@ gger plug @-@ in in the project settings . with the Options button next to the debu@@ gger plug @-@ in selection field , the specific settings can be changed .
if a debu@@ gger is activated for a project , some additional elements appear in the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; user interface :
a view where the contents of monitored variables are displayed . usually appears in the left dock .
a view where all stops are listed , with line numbers and conditions . usually appears in the bottom dock .
a view in which the output ( as in HTML ) of the debu@@ gger is shown . usually appears in the bottom dock .
depending on the supported functions of the debu@@ gger , all or part of the following functionality is available .
with this action , the connection to the debu@@ gger if necessary , or it tells the plugin to listen to de@@ bug requirements . this action is triggered by default if a project is opened that uses a debu@@ gger , so that normally it doesn &apos;t have to be respected .
the counterpart to Deb@@ ug@@ ging session Start the session . closes the connection to the debu@@ gger or termin@@ ates listening to requirements .
sends an HTTP request to the server to initiate a debu@@ gging request . this is equivalent to the use of a browser to view the current document . the output of this request is displayed in the View Deb@@ ug@@ ger output .
instruc@@ ts the debu@@ gger to start exec@@ uting the script and continuously send information about the monitored variables as well as the currently executed line . if this happens while the script is stopped , execution continues .
instruc@@ ts the debu@@ gger to start exec@@ uting the script without having to send information to monitored variables and the current line number . if this happens while a script is stopped , execution continues .
the debu@@ gger will execute the next instruction in the script without entering the functions or include .
the debu@@ gger will execute the next instruction in the script , where possible error @-@ adjusted in functions and include .
instruc@@ t the debu@@ gger to pass the instruction and go to the next one as if there were not the current one .
opens a dialog where a variable or an expression can be entered , which should be monitored . the monitored value appears in the variable view .
with this dialog you can enter a variable or set a new value of a variable .
&amp; k@@ x@@ s@@ l ; is a work of Kei@@ th Is@@ dale as well as this part of the documentation . &amp; k@@ x@@ s@@ l ; is a &amp; k@@ de ; Front @-@ end and a part of x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g , which you can find on ht@@ t@@ p : / / x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g@@ .@@ s@@ f@@ .net with many other works of Kei@@ th .
this chapter describes how to adjust &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; adapt to your needs and how to help &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; help to get better .
document type Edi@@ ting packages ( D@@ TE@@ P ; s ) are used in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; to give support for mark@@ up and scrip@@ ting languages as well as CSS ; they enable &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; their simplicity and flexibility makes out &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; a fast , user @-@ friendly &amp; IDE ; for web developers , simple to use and productive .
&amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; s are available in two types , family 1 , the mark@@ up languages and family 2 , the script languages and / CSS ; s . &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; s consist of two parts , the tag folder and tool@@ bars . tag folder contains handy , symbol @-@ orient@@ ated lad@@ ders of image buttons ( above the editing window ) , which insert text and instructions more quickly into a document than a user could ever have .
&amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; s can be created manually ( see below ) , downloaded or automatically created from an existing D@@ TD . see for details on converting .
this document describes how to create tag XML files , then descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; and also tool@@ bars . in short , a &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; .
tag@@ XML files ( .@@ tag ) define both the specific attributes for tags as well as the layout and contents of the properties dialog , the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; for the tag . file descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; file contains the rules and information of the &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; even . tool@@ bars allow a quick insertion of tags into a document without a risk of writing error .
tag folders are nothing but a folder . they contain only the file descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; and the Tag@@ XML files . tag files carry the name of the description language and version , so available . ( for example , html @-@ 4.@@ 01 @-@ strict )
the table below lists the elements of Tag@@ XML and declares whether they are necessary , or not . although not all are necessary , it is advisable to use as many as possible so that other users have a better insight and more information at work with them .
the following chapter describes each element in detail . everything about the possibilities and limits is explained in a simple way .
this is the root element of a tag XML document . it can only occur once in a document . it can contain the definition of many tags , but contains nothing but element type about itself otherwise .
the type of tags is a script function . when using &amp; lt ; att@@ r &gt; is an argument of the function . ( only family 2 )
valid only for the class class . the name of the base class for this class . ( only family 2 )
only valid for the method method . specifies the name of the class where this method belongs . ( only family 2 )
when yes , the tag has a common attribute group and the attributes within this tag can be added to any other tag . ( only family 1 )
sets a text in the dialog . this text is defined by &amp; lt ; text &gt; tag . this is a single element type element .
describes an attribute of a tag . this element can only occur once for each attribute . it defines the name and type of the attribute . in addition , there are other tags that describe how to display this attribute , etc ; This is a single element type element .
specifies the source code used to fill the attributes in the tag editing dialog and in the attribute tree .
requires source = d@@ co@@ p . the d@@ co@@ p interface within &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; used to reach source data .
requires source = d@@ co@@ p and the name of an interface . the d@@ co@@ p method name within &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; used to achieve the data source .
requires source = d@@ co@@ p , a interface and a method name . the arguments passed to the method . can be empty or % tag@@ name % , which means the name of the current day .
a container tag that group@@ ed the elements of a list . it can only occur once for an attribute description . it is an element type element only .
defines the position of the attribute text of a tag within a dialog . this tag can only occur once for each attribute in a dialog only once ( e.g. once for each attribute ; att@@ r &gt; tag ) . the element is empty .
specifies the position and size of a field in the dialog . this tag should be present for each field in the dialog once ( e.g. one for each field ; att@@ r &gt; and lt ; label &gt; Tag ) . this element is empty .
specifies a list of elements that may occur within the tags to be defined . this element is a single element type .
returns a list of elements that end a day . this element is a single element type .
all Tag@@ XML files must start with a &amp; XML ; -@@ declaration ; &amp; lt ; ? XML version = 1.0 encoding = U@@ TF @-@ 8 ? &gt; and must be ne@@ at@@ ly ch@@ ained and closed .
spaces don &apos;t affect anything but pay attention to &amp; lt ; characters . these should be replaced by &amp; amp ; , especially in elements such as &amp; lt ; tool@@ tip &gt; , &amp; lt ; text &gt; replaced .
to check the Tag@@ XML files , the Tools dialog is in the top of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; window to start and check Tag@@ X@@ ML@@ . another dialog will appear , whose simple instructions are to follow .
this function is currently not available . currently , the check is only performed when loading the Tag@@ ged files in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us .
in the following example for a family 1 Tag@@ ged XML file . this file describes &amp; lt ; schema &gt; element from the &amp; W3@@ C ; &amp; XML ; schema . the file name for this Tag@@ XML file should be schem@@ a.@@ tag .
in the following example for a working family 2 Tag@@ ged XML file . in this file , a &amp; PHP ; over@@ load function is described . the file name of this Tag@@ XML file should be over@@ load@@ .@@ tag .
&amp; lt ; ? XML version = &quot; 1.0 &quot; encoding = &quot; U@@ TF @-@ 8 &quot; ? &gt; &amp; lt ; ! doc@@ type tags &gt; &amp; lt ; tags &gt; &amp; lt ; tag name = &quot; over@@ load &quot; type = &quot; class _ name &quot; type = &quot; option &quot; / &gt; &amp; lt ; / tag &gt; &amp; lt ; / tags &gt;
the file descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; file is just as simple and there is an editor for at@@ tain@@ able via D@@ TD editing D@@ TD settings . thus , di@@ ed@@ es@@ cri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; for a newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; for a newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; should be created a simple &amp; descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; with the following entries :

an action can be set with Settings actions ... to be created . click on New Action to perform the same dialog :
the keyboard short@@ cut assigned to this action . by clicking on the Custom button , a short@@ cut can be assigned ; with K@@ 1 , the current keyboard short@@ cut can be removed .
the simplest actions . a text can be entered in the detailed settings and when exec@@ uting the action , this text is inserted in the document at the current cursor position . see the example below .
this is the most powerful type of action . with the help of this action , external applications ( usually scripts , but it is not limited ) that change the document or use as input ( or parts of the document ) can be started . examples from &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; themselves are the Quick Start dialog or the various see in ... actions for the ( X ) HTML D@@ TE@@ Ps .
first , the name of the script and the interpreter must be specified . example : SH / home / my@@ Home / my@@ Scrip@@ t.@@ sh .
although qualified paths are allowed , it is recommended to use the % scrip@@ t@@ dir variable in the command line , such as sh % scrip@@ t@@ dir / my@@ Scrip@@ t.@@ sh@@ . This way tries &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; the script in the following places : $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / scripts in their path : $ PAT@@ H There is another special variable that can be used in the command line :
% f : we will be replaced with the URL of the current document . in case of a local document file : / from the document name will be removed .
% p@@ id : will be replaced with the PID of the current &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; only one instance runs , the text unique is attached to the PID number . this is useful when D@@ CO@@ P is used to control &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; it is used by the external script .
the parameter for this event , usually the file name of the current document or path to the project file .
in addition to the methods listed above , a script can input from &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; to the default input . in the input field input can be determined what to send to the default input . options are :
selected text : the selected area of the document is sent to the script . the % input variable is normally only meaningful with this setting .
according to the input , the output of the executed application can also be re@@ directed . there are two types of output : normal output , written to the standard output ; error messages , to the standard error output . it can be specified , which is to be done with the text written to the standard output by setting the value in the output field output :
if there are many tags in the mark@@ up language , it is recommended to sub@@ divide the tags into logical groups . in the given case , it is not too many , so you can create a toolbar with the name of the pop@@ up .
once a toolbar has been added , you need to add and configure actions . select Settings .
the parts of this window are quite self @-@ explan@@ atory . press the New Action button at the bottom of the window starts editing mode .
fill out all necessary fields and add the tag to the appropriate toolbar .
complete everything and , if the Tag Attribute has attributes and you are planning to use it , enable &quot; Edit Tag &quot; dialog when available to allow input when using the action .
Ig@@ itt ! is this an ug@@ ly symbol . who should remember the action in connection with this symbol ? let &apos;s replace it before we have difficulties .
to create a symbol that represents the action better , we will use &amp; ki@@ con@@ edit ; choose from &amp; K@@ Menu ; , Graphic Other programs ( or where else it is located in your distribution ) .
&amp; ki@@ con@@ edit ; uses 32@@ x@@ 32 pixels by default , but we need 22@@ x@@ 22 . to change this , select Edit size .
please note that the created symbol not only helps you to remember what the action does , but also to all other users of the &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; .
with regard to the fact that the day starts , I decided to create a start button as a symbol . by using green ( green usually appears to be los , star@@ ed , further interpreted ) , or should at least be sign@@ aled a message to the user that clicking this symbol is a &amp; lt ; start ; tag in the current document .
after creating the symbol , it still has to be connected with the action . this is done through the menu with Settings actions ... ( in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; ) and selecting the desired action . next to the text box is a button , press it .
select the folder where the saved symbol is located , select it and confirm with OK .
press the Apply button and continue with other tags , so there are others , or confirm with OK to complete .
suppose you want to add some common &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; functions to the toolbar , or it should be divided into several groups for a better overview by some separ@@ ators .
after selecting the element that is to be added to the toolbar , press the arrow key to the right . this adds the item to the toolbar .
for example , I would like to have a quick way to access the Kon@@ quer@@ or preview . I will select it and add it to the toolbar .
please note how the separ@@ ator support the group@@ ing . someone who does not know my tool bar could believe that the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; button is the opposite of the start button .
the new toolbar has to be tested by mastur@@ b@@ ating all the symbols to ensure that everything works .
save to the right folder . after new XML does not exist , it will be created in the root folder , but your toolbar ( s ) should be stored in the correct folder . please adjust your file descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c so that your toolbar ( s ) is loaded ( s ) when a file is opened from the corresponding type .
perhaps the most notable extension of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; for the normal user it is possible to add documentation for the scrip@@ ting language or the format@@ ting language you like most . that &apos;s why this chapter describes how I create a PHP ; documentation tree for my personal use .
before starting your own documentation , you might check in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; -@@ Rep@@ osit@@ ory if someone has already done it for you .
there are two parts in this process . first you need to look for an existing documentation for the format@@ ting / script / etc ; language . then you need to create the doc@@ r@@ c file . we &apos;ll leave the first part to you , we treat the second one here .
# K@@ DE Configuration File &#91; Tree &#93; Do@@ c dir = path , relative to this file , to the documentation HTML files e.g. ph@@ p@@ 42 / # elements in the main index Top element = your description for these docum@@ ent@@ aries e.g. &amp; PHP ; 4.2 Docum@@ entation Section 1 = Sec@@ tion@@ 1.@@ html Sec@@ 2.1 = Sec@@ tion@@ 1.@@ html Sec@@ 2.1 = Sec@@ tion@@ 1.@@ html Sec@@ 2.1 = Sec@@ tion@@ 1.@@ html tag@@ 1 = func@@ name tag@@ 2 = func@@ name tag@@ 2 = tag@@ 1.@@ html tag@@ 2 = func@@ tions@@ .@@ html tag@@ 3 = tag@@ 1.@@ html tag@@ 3 = func@@ tions@@ .@@ html
the Tree section defines the visible part of the documentation in the documentation tree . for example , see the section in PHP ; documentation such as :
# K@@ DE Con@@ fig File &#91; Tree &#93; Do@@ c &#93; Do@@ c dir = ph@@ p@@ 42 / # top level element top element = PHP 4.2 documentation PHP 4.2 documentation = Table of Cont@@ ents = inde@@ x.@@ html Get@@ ting Star@@ ted = Intro@@ duction , ...
note the # vor Get@@ ting Star@@ ted and Language Reference . this indicates that it is sub@@ folders in the tree with its own content . there is no known limit for the depth of the shaft ( except by reason ) , but try it yourself .
note that the table of contents is refer@@ enced directly to a file ( and consequently at the top end of the tree view &amp; m@@ das@@ h ; the folder is displayed ! ) .
spaces affect nothing but pay attention to &amp; lt ; characters . these should be replaced by &amp; amp ; in all &amp; XML ; -@@ based &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; resources files will be replaced .
the content section is the area of the doc@@ r@@ c file , which is used to create context sensitive help . for example , when writing a &amp; PHP ; script the documentation for the my@@ sq@@ l _ fetch _ array function should be displayed . there are only two types of entries : the context list ( context list ) and file connection lines .
a simple list of contex@@ tual elements that should be available ( for &amp; PHP ; , these are the functions of &amp; PHP ; ) .
now you can easily save your doc@@ r@@ c file to $ HO@@ ME / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / doc or $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / doc for local or global use . then create a folder ( just as you specified this in your doc@@ r@@ c file ) in the same folder as doc@@ r@@ c and copy your HTML documentation to it .
if you are sure that these are good and worth sharing , send your doc@@ r@@ c files with a description of important information , e.g. which documentation was used to the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; -@@ community . you will not be rich , but proud to have worked with the best web development platform .
with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; you are not alone . it is possible to share the waste resources ( D@@ TE@@ P pack@@ ets , tool@@ bars with actions , scripts , templates ) with others . there are two ways to do this :
the resources can be sent by e @-@ mail to friends , partners or otherwise . in different places , you can send an Email to a menu item , such as D@@ TD D@@ TD ( D@@ TD ) package ( D@@ TE@@ P ) , in the context menu of files and folders in the templates and in the script tree .
the resources can be uploaded into our main archive , from where all the other &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; users can download them . to make a contribution we recommend signing the resources for which it needs a G@@ PG / P@@ GP key . thus , the origin of resources is guaranteed , both for our team and for later users .
when up@@ loading , you are asked for their pas@@ sp@@ hr@@ ase for their private G@@ PG keys ( the pas@@ sp@@ hr@@ ase is not saved ) , or in the event that you have multiple keys , you can choose one . in the New resource dialogue , the input fields must be filled out ( URL preview can remain empty ) and by clicking on the OK button you can start up@@ loading .
up@@ loading can be up@@ loading from menus D@@ TD D@@ TD package ( D@@ TE@@ P ) , up@@ loading tool@@ bars , and started in the context menu of files and folders in the templates and scripts tree .
after downloading a resource , before installation , checked &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; the integrity of the resource by checking integrity and signing . in case of problems it warns and it can then be abor@@ ted . if the integrity is given and the resource is signed correctly , a message appears with the indication of the source of the resource .
it is possible to work in XML languages currently not supported by &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; however , creating a D@@ TE@@ P package can be time @-@ consuming , because hundreds of tag files in tag XML format might be necessary . there is a simpler way to convert a D@@ TD into a D@@ TE@@ P package automatically .
the conversion can be started from the D@@ TD menu and Con@@ vert a D@@ TD . select the .@@ d@@ t@@ d file with the D@@ TD description to be used . then the following dialog appears :
target directory name : the newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; is written with this name in the $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / d@@ te@@ p folder .
! doc@@ type Defin@@ tion line : the string that will appear in the ! doc@@ type tag , such as HTML PU@@ B@@ LI@@ C - / / W3@@ C / / D@@ TD HTML 4.@@ 01 Transi@@ tional / / EN ht@@ t@@ p : / / www.@@ w@@ 3.@@ org / TR / HTML@@ 4 / loos@@ e.@@ d@@ t@@ d
fine adjustment of the D@@ TE@@ P after conversion : if enabled , adds &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; after converting the file descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; editor , with the details of the newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; it is recommended to use this option .
in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; there are some key concepts . in order to understand them and to take full advantage of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us , one must first famili@@ ari@@ ze oneself with these fundamental concepts . this chapter tries to teach them precisely these concepts without understanding their understanding &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us .
in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; the work area is divided into three areas : global , local and project @-@ related . this distinction concerns a number of components in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; .
global elements are available to anyone who uses &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; all that is marked globally is stored in the common folder structure of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us . this allows the group of administrators to secure different tool@@ bars , actions and patterns in the global tree that will then be available to everyone in a multi @-@ user environment on the system .
local elements represent a personal collection of web development tools for a single user . these are user @-@ specific patterns and tool@@ bars . local elements are stored in the user directory so that only the user can use them personally .
project @-@ related elements are available only within a specific project . this can be everything from &amp; CSS ; patterns to tool@@ bars with special actions specifically for the files of a particular project . simply put , this is the most restricted size . all elements are stored in the folder tree of the project , which em@@ o@@ ys the common usage of special tools and patterns from all employees within the project .
the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; -@@ M@@ DI ; consists of some main areas : the editor window , the construction prospects , the tabs with information and the tool bars . please suggest in and for more information on these areas .
you can click on the tabs with the right mouse button to get a context menu with the current document appropriate entries , such as closing the current , other or all tr@@ un@@ ei@@ vers , rel@@ o@@ ad , delete or upload the document , jump to a book@@ mark or execution of CVS commands to the current document .
right @-@ click in the Editor area will lead to another context menu on the processed document content , such as basic editing steps ( cut / paste / paste ) , edit the tag under the mouse poin@@ ter , or open the file when the character string under the mouse @-@ cursor describes a file .
at the top end of the editor window are the toolbar of the editor . currently &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; &amp; HTML ; 4.@@ 01 Transi@@ tional as standard , for which a set of tool@@ bars is shown . in the course of further expansion of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us , the tool@@ bars are adapted to the new functions and related user needs .
the use of tool bars is really easy . if you want to insert a simple tag , e.g. &amp; lt ; insert into your document , then click the icon that represents the tag . now you can enter the data for this just inserted day . if you want to insert a tag that has multiple attributes ( such as anch@@ ors ) , you can fill in a dialog different fields .
the Building In@@ sights ( Q@@ IT ) make it possible to navigate in the information to &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; to navigate , open it and strip them . in the presentation with card readers are available for files , project , model templates , document structure , scripts , attributes and documentation .
project Management is a powerful tool that provides &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; this view shows all files in the project and allows to manage files in the project by right mouse click . actions such as adding , removing , up@@ loading or del@@ eting files from the storage medium can be performed using the context menu displayed .
another possibility of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; is the use of templates . almost everything can be a template : pictures , program parts , a whole website &amp; etc ; all possibilities are open to you .
templates can be divided into three categories depending on which context they are used . global templates are always available , local templates are available only for the corresponding user and templates in projects can only be used in the project . more on templates can be found in the project .
here you will find information about the available scrip@@ ting languages . the concept of spl@@ itting into global , local and project works also here . by clicking with the left mouse button , you can access the available information to a script .
this view shows the internal structure of the active document . by clicking on an element , the cursor is placed in the document on the position of the element . by right @-@ clicking on an element , a list of commands is opened with respect to navigation and refresh of the tree .
this tree appears among the other tree views . with it , it can quickly change attributes and nam@@ esp@@ aces . the application system aligned to the content allows the change of all available attributes with just a few mouse clicks .
here is the complete documentation on the web technology for your development . you can download pre @-@ packed documentation for &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; from the qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; &apos; Docum@@ entation site , you can create your own documentation , and by adding a folder doc to a project can be app@@ ended , edited and viewed .
by default &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; two tabs at the bottom of the window that can be accessed using the useful information : the message window and the problem window .
this tab displays information about each script running in Qu@@ anta . for example , the currently used D@@ TD of the current document and all changes to D@@ TD are displayed .
this tab shows all errors in the mark@@ up of the current document . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; -@@ scripts that are executed give all error messages ( as there are ) in this window .
die &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; tool bars are extensive and easy to understand . show them on a symbol and they receive the corresponding command . the chocolate page of the toolbar is the possibility to define your own commands as symbols in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us .
another function of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; is the ability to send a toolbar with E@@ Mail . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; sends the toolbar as compressed T@@ ar archive via &amp; k@@ mail ; . if they receive a toolbar in an email , they can secure and load them in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; like any other .
it is reasonable if you want to adjust the location of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; files on your system . for this auto@@ conf has a number of options that can be passed to the configure script . to get a complete list of all options , type . / configure --@@ help . the options are easy to understand and not executed here .
if you have problems starting &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; you should check if your path contains the &amp; k@@ de ; 3 bin folder . also , you should make sure that no older version of &amp; k@@ de ; 3 in the PAT@@ H is in front of its bin folder . the same goes for &amp; Q@@ t ; .
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; is a web development tool for the K@@ DE desktop . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; has been optimized for rapid web development and combines a mature development environment with a variety of powerful features .
while trying to create the best &amp; HTML ; editor , the developers of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us began to deal with an obvious idea : what would be if &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; an independent , exp@@ and@@ able mark@@ up language editor would ? well , this would make it the absolutely great web development tool for &amp; k@@ de ; so it was done .
no longer limited to pure &amp; HTML ; limited , is &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; now well on the way to a general and comprehensive web development tool . summari@@ zed : if you can define it in &amp; XML ; then &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; for this the appropriate &amp; IDE ; be .
well , to the above claim must be stated that &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; as a product based on the outstanding efforts of the entire &amp; small ; developer community is based . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; follows , in good use of free software , the idea of why develop , what has someone else developed ? thanks to the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ sc@@ aff@@ old not only this is possible , but it allows users and developers to expand , as they need it for their needs .
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; allows web developers to dramatically increase the use of an intuitive and powerful multi @-@ document surface ( M@@ DI ; ) . by means of self @-@ kn@@ itted actions , scripts and tool@@ bars , automation is almost every task possible .
&amp; Qu@@ anta ; Plus ; is a web development environment for HTML and related languages . it was designed for rapid web development and quickly expanded into a mature editor with many powerful features .
&amp; Qu@@ anta ; Plus is in no way associated with commercial versions of &amp; Qu@@ anta ; the original developers left the GP@@ L licensed version and produced a commercial program .
more in the detailed documentation is provided with help : / Qu@@ anta ( either this URL in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; type , or k@@ hel@@ p@@ center help : / Qu@@ anta ) .
&amp; Qu@@ anta ; is currently being developed and managed by Eric L@@ aff@@ oon Sequ@@ itur @ k@@ de@@ .org and Andr@@ as Man@@ tia am@@ anti@@ a @ k@@ de@@ .org .
a quick access list of files that you have opened . this list changes every time you open a file that is not on it , the oldest entry is taken out .
this allows you to save code parts and whole files as templates for later use . check the section about templates . if you are trying to save the selected file / text outside the local / project template folder , only one error will be reported .
converts special characters to &amp; HTML when inser@@ ting from the clip@@ board , so that they are displayed correctly and not mis@@ understood by the browser as format@@ ting instruction .
converts the text from the clip@@ board into &amp; URL ; -@@ Description , which is the correct way to insert special characters and spaces in &amp; URL ; s . primarily used to insert &amp; URL ; s into the anchor tag .
switches the block selection on or off . this allows you to select text blocks using the &amp; Shift key .
go directly to a line number . this is very helpful if your &amp; PHP ; -@@ script releases error messages !
search a string or regular expression in the selected directory . a type gre@@ p or sed with GUI and predefined expression to help you .
displays the message window or not . that is the window in which you see the display of script actions and the debu@@ gger .
routing and switching on the problem repor@@ ter at the bottom of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; main window . the problem repor@@ ter is activated as soon as you change to the structure tree .
displays the column links on the left of the main window . this column allows you to set book@@ marks with a mouse click .
if there are book@@ marks in the current file , they will appear in the menu along with the entries Previous or Next , depending on the cursor position in the document .
book@@ marks from other opened documents appear in the menu according to the file name of the other documents .
opens an existing project from the hard disk . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; -@@ Projects are saved with the file extension .@@ web@@ pr@@ j .
presents a dialog to insert files into the current project . the selected files will then be copied to the project directory .
searches the project directory for new files that could be there . this allows you to copy graphics files to your project folder or sub@@ folder and then add them to the project .
upload files in your project to the server . the list of available transportation methods depends on your version of &amp; k@@ de ; and whether you have downloaded more input / output modules ( K@@ IO slaves ) .
settings like &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; the project managed . in chapter &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us , you will find the details .
loads a project tool bar . these are stored in Project You / tool@@ bars and are only in this menu if you have assigned them to this project .
a dialog to save your toolbar . allows you to select the type of toolbar : locally or project .
opens a dialog to add a new toolbar . this only creates the name . actions must be saved by means of Settings ... Add . toolbar buttons are saved by toolbar buttons or you will be asked if you want to save the toolbar buttons .
removes a toolbar from the field of view . this does not delete it from the disk . if you haven &apos;t saved the toolbar , you will be asked if you want to do so .
this allows you to send your own toolbar to someone ( perhaps to the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; team so that the tool bar is present in the next publication ) . the menu item opens a new email message with the toolbar as attachment .
allows up@@ loading tool@@ bars to the main server , where everyone else can access it . see in .
load a &amp; D@@ TD ; you or anyone else has made and convert to &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; own description format .
load / refresh the entities from the &amp; D@@ TD ; it makes sense if the entities from the &amp; D@@ TD are to be refres@@ hed without updating the whole &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; if this is global and a write permission in the global K@@ DE folder is not present , the load fails .
this menu contains a list of tags that are present in the currently loaded tool@@ bars . if the standard ( HTML ; ) toolbar is loaded , there is a sub@@ menu standard in the tags menu , which contains the list of tags / actions on this toolbar .
allows access to the current day settings dialog when there is one . this entry is always present in the Tags menu , followed by &amp; D@@ TD ; -@@ specific sub @-@ menus .
currently , this only works with ( X ) HTML D@@ T@@ Ds . intelligent inser@@ ting means that &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; inser@@ ting the paste by tool@@ bars if this day contradic@@ ts the rules .
in the plugin menu , the available plug@@ ins are listed under the menu items above . click on them .
sel@@ ects syntax high@@ lighting mode for the current file . the list of available high@@ lighting schem@@ ata depends on the current version .
select the type of line end identi@@ fier . very useful when you know people using other OS platforms to develop . choose Unix , Windows / DOS or Macintosh .
checks the syntax of the current document using the selected &amp; D@@ TD ; by means of the external application ti@@ dy .
immediate change@@ over between different types of user interface . due to some limitations in the K@@ DE libraries , switching may sometimes take time or cause un@@ attractive graphics . recommended is the flash@@ card mode , which is also the default setting , or the sub@@ window mode that corresponds to the representation in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; 3.2 and earlier .
in addition , this menu provides an entry for each open sub @-@ window . selecting an entry will activate the corresponding sub@@ window .
switches the status bar on the bottom of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; main window or from .
the changes in this dialog will affect any application using the K@@ HTML part , including the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; web browser .
specifies the behavior of the editor window . in the documentation of &amp; k@@ ate , one finds details .
a dialog appears in which you delete entries from the toolbar or add them and change the sequences .
this should create a help corresponding to the environment of the mouse poin@@ ter , but is not implemented yet .
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; is a high @-@ quality product that is freely available and licensed , but as with any open source project , developers can always use help . if they want to support the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; development in financial form , they find the way here .
the fields are self @-@ explan@@ atory and should preferably be filled from top to bottom , since , for example , after completing the project name , the whole directory structure is completed automatically for the rest of the project . all those paths and author information fields can be set later using Shift ; F@@ 7 Project Project Properties .
here is the name for the project to enter , for example fo@@ o . when entering Name , file will be filled in automatically .
this is the name of the Qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; project file . by default , it has the name of the project in lower@@ case and without spaces with extension web@@ pr@@ j ( e.g. foo@@ .@@ web@@ pr@@ j ) . this file is stored in the project directory .
here you enter the server address of the machine you want to access , unless you edit local data . either a name ( host@@ nam@@ e.@@ de@@ .de ) or an IP address ( 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 ) are possible .
if you leave this field empty , the default settings of the chosen protocol will be used . depending on the remote host setting , an adjustment could be necessary .
this is the folder where templates for the project are stored . it is a relative path to the project and templates . if a common collection of files is used for different projects , this folder should be set instead of the standard .
this is the folder where the tool@@ bars are stored for the project . it is a relative path to the project and tool@@ bars as standard . if a common collection of files is used for different projects , this folder should be set instead of the standard .
this allows to insert files from the local file system into the project . multiple files or entire folders can be selected .
this setting is great if you have static web content you want to download and edit . for server @-@ side scripts ( e.g. &amp; PHP ; , Python , etc ; ) you have to go differently .
let it be checked if files that are located somewhere in the main folder of the project should be included . if a project is started anew from scratch , do not hook .
this option displays all files and folders within the main folder and you can make an exact selection according to good man@@ ure .
this shows a list of files in the main folder . you can select the files you want by hooks or by removing the check@@ box from the project .
the last screen of the new project wizard contains three settings that simplify your work . these settings can be uploaded in the menu with project Project Properties in the sub@@ window profiles , or modified with Shift ; F@@ 7 .
some settings correspond to those in the project wizard and are described in . the additional entries are explained below .
a list of file names ( plac@@ eholders is possible ) , which are ignored in project @-@ related operations such as project folders .
additional option to above , also files listed in .@@ c@@ v@@ sign@@ ore , are excluded from the project .
the project view , which is loaded when the project is opened , can be read more about project views .
this can be used to select the desired debu@@ gger . currently only Gu@@ bed is supported . more information about Gu@@ bed can be found in . the debu@@ gger plug @-@ in can be set using the Options button .
up@@ loading profiles ( see in ) can be set in the Pro@@ files sub@@ window , as well as the display of a tree view for the contents of the server for each profile by pointing out its own tree view for each profile .
in the team configuration sub@@ window , project members can be added , edited or deleted as well as a mailing list . see the details .
in the event configuration sub@@ window , you can turn on event actions and add , change or delete events . event actions are executed when a previously specific event occurs , such as securing a file . see the details .
by default , you open &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; the last project that was opened . you can &apos;t influence this behavior at present .
to open another project , select Open Project ... from the Project or the Project Open Project from the toolbar . the dialog project will be displayed and allows the selection of a project . projects have .@@ web@@ pr@@ j as extension .
if &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; closed , the project file will be saved automatically . you will be asked if you want to save changes before leaving , if &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; changed files . the same happens when you load a new project .
the project tree view gives free access to the files in the project . there the files can be managed in the current project .
the folder beha@@ ves as well , but the entries are missing open and open with ... in the context menu accessible with the right mouse button :
various profiles can be selected here . the profile contains information about the location of the uploaded files . see .
allows removing the current profile . if only one profile exists , the button is blin@@ ded to prevent removing .
the password is kept in the core memory and forgotten when it comes to programming . this option is useful when frequent up@@ loading of files is necessary and the rather un@@ secure password is saved on the disk -@@ option is not in question .
this will stop the transfer or simply leave the dialog when you change your mind before up@@ loading .
in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; many high@@ load profiles can be created , so that the project ( or parts of the project ) can be uploaded to different servers . when editing or creating a profile , this dialog will be displayed :
this is the name of the server to which the files should be copied . either a fully qualified domain name or an IP address will work .
the transfer protocol for up@@ loading . the list depends on the version of &amp; k@@ de ; and the installed ki@@ o slaves . at least you should choose from &amp; FTP ; , file ( local ) and n@@ fs .
the port for the transfer . normally this does not need to be changed except the network administrator does not run a service on the usual port .
depending on your fear threshold , this is either a time @-@ saving function or a danger . use it at your discretion . the password is stored on the disk , so it can &apos;t be read easily , but everyone with programming knowledge can easily see it in plain text .
a project view is just a set of files and tool bars . there can be many views in a project , i.e. by simply sw@@ apping the view various files and toolbar buttons can be loaded and replace the currently opened files and tool@@ bars .
views can be saved , opened or deleted in the Project or Project toolbar , accessible via Settings Tool@@ bar Project Tool@@ bar .
this chapter describes the parts of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us , with which one has to do the most . this not only helps increase productivity but also allows the adjustment of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; to the own way of working .
as already mentioned above , toolbar buttons in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; best can be st@@ owed by the toolbar . use and Add differ . adding tool@@ bars is treated at the bottom of the Adding tool bar section .
the toolbar and the symbols on it can be adjusted either by context menu ( right @-@ click on the toolbar ) , in which other actions such as toolbar buttons can be removed , toolbar buttons or tool@@ bars can be executed , which will be displayed in the dialog where it can be specified , which actions should be visible on this or other toolbar .
by calling the context menu to an action ( symbol ) on a toolbar , the entries will be removed and action processed , which are self @-@ explan@@ atory .
the toolbar and the actions on them can set up toolbar buttons in the menu with Settings ... and Set@@ ting Settings .
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; templates are basically like a common file system with advanced organization and interfaces . you can copy , move or merge any existing directory into the template tree . templates have in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; in about the limitations one imag@@ ines for the file system .
some with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; provided templates have conditions for their use . please read the conditions specified at the beginning of each template before use .
binary templates are usually included in documents using short@@ cuts ( e.g. pictures with im@@ g sr@@ c = / sr@@ c / ur@@ l ) . some examples can be found in the template tree under global templates .
documents can be of any text document type . on the basis of these templates , new documents can be created . usually , more specific documents are written in appropriate sub@@ folders . a simple framework for the purpose and organizes work in a corresponding way to be efficient . some examples can be found in the template tree under global templates . see for more information on the template tree .
this kind of templates is useful if not a new document based on a template but the same text area should always be inserted in the documents . you can include everything from a comment about a final note to a complete menu system on Javascript or Perl basis . some examples can be found in the template tree under global templates . see for more information on the template tree .
as the name says , these templates serve as templates for whole websites . they are a collection of various documents organized in a folder structure , summari@@ zed in a compressed tar archive . currently there are no examples in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; .
create a document structure as you like ( XML ; , &amp; HTML ; , Doc@@ Book , etc ; ) and select Save As Tem@@ plate Save As a local template ....
as soon as this is done , note that ( even if it is saved as a project template ) the template is not visible in the project tree . look in the template tree under project templates .
select text in your document and click Save as template Save as local / project template . alternatively , the selection can easily be dra@@ gged and dra@@ gged onto the tree view templates .
the creation of binary templates is simple : just copy the file into a template folder . all file management functions can be used , such as dra@@ gging and dra@@ gging or past@@ ing over the Kon@@ quer@@ or file tree .
you can click on a folder to the right in the file tree or in the project files , select a name for the template , and secure it . by default , it is backed up in the project folder , but of course it can be saved as a local or global template .
project templates allow a very goal @-@ oriented approach . you can set head@@ lines and foot@@ ers or dynamically interact with &amp; PHP ; create , insert files or link them with them . in addition , you can keep an eye on some things when using templates in projects .
the template structure in the Tem@@ plate Tem@@ plates is based on the files stored in $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / templates and $ HO@@ ME / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / templates . each of these folders complies with one of four types of containers as explained above .
to specify the behavior of a folder is to click on the folder with the right mouse button and select Properties in the context menu . the following dialog appears :
a selection box with the three previously described types ; files , text or templates .
this is enabled by default and fits everything except the regular folders in the template list . if a root folder would be set in such a way , it would be explicitly enabled in this path unless it appears explicitly . in case of a normal folder , the bla@@ h would appear with something like text module . if nothing appears , you will probably be in a root folder .
allows previous or copied text for templates in this folder . this could be general header lines and foot@@ ers for all templates for a specific project and allows a whole presentation to be provided with the appropriate he@@ aders / foot@@ ers by copying content templates into a folder with special head@@ lines / foot@@ ers .
in addition , you have context menu ( pointing right mouse button ) through a complete command collection for adding folders or copying and inser@@ ting templates from one place to another .
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; offers two modes : V@@ PL ; editor and V@@ PL ; &amp; Source text editor available through the View menu . the first mode replaces the source editor by the V@@ PL ; editor and the second divi@@ des the editor window into two parts : the source editor and the V@@ PL ; editor .
the V@@ PL ; editor works as follows : it loads a document like a normal &amp; HTML ; - or &amp; X@@ HTML ; page and a cursor . then you can edit and switch back to the source code editor , in which the changes made in the V@@ PL ; editor are visible in the source code .
when working with the V@@ PL ; editor in a document that contains &amp; PHP ; a small green symbol indicates the default of &amp; PHP ; source code . it is not possible to edit it directly with the V@@ PL ; editor . to edit and PHP ; it is still necessary to change the code editor . there are no plans to change this behavior .
the second mode works just like the first one , except that the changes are visible both in the source editor and in the V@@ PL ; editor synchron@@ ously . by pressing F@@ 9 this mode is activated , this mode is already active , the key pressure moves the active cursor from one window to the other , keeping the position in the document .
the synchron@@ isation distance between the V@@ PL ; editor and the source code editor can be set using the Qu@@ anta settings .... After selecting V@@ PL , you can choose between synchronization after one click or automatically . in principle , the recommendation is : a small span for fast computers and a large span for slow .
suppose you want to change the title of the website , it is possible to select document properties . thus , editing of invisible tags at work with the V@@ PL @-@ editor is possible . the document properties dialog is also inv@@ oked as soon as a new document is created with the V@@ PL ; editor . this can change the following :
met@@ a tags allow the storage of information about the document itself , e.g. keywords for Internet search engines . met@@ a elements can be added or removed by pressing the two buttons below . a click on the list allows to change the content , e.g. keywords on the column name and keyword keyword 2 on the content column .
CSS rules are the new way of designing pages in your browser . you can add or delete CSS rules with the buttons under the list . editing CSS rules is currently not supported .
it is possible to include an external CSS style template by pressing the file @-@ open button and selecting the appropriate file .
it is possible to use the cursor as in a word processor , by moving the arrows . under rare circumstances the cursor acts as usual . the selection works as usual . text can be inserted by typing and del@@ etes it by button or distance key .
inser@@ ting tags is done in the same way as the tool@@ bars , as in the source code editor . note that inser@@ ting tags previously existing identical tags is not removed e.g. when an anchor day , surrounded with text , must be removed any other surrounding anchor day .
some tool@@ bars like the tables assistant or the Listen @-@ Wizard are disabled . you will later be in the &amp; V@@ PL ; work , in this release the tables or lists must be used toolbar .
&amp; x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g ; is a tool for checking style sheets . unlike other style sheets , the search for certain elements is possible and the style of style sheets can be tra@@ cked .
um &amp; x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g ; successfully compile , do not need &amp; c@@ de ; nor the lib@@ x@@ s@@ lt , li@@ be@@ x@@ s@@ lt and lib@@ x@@ ml libraries , which are already present in a typical installation of &amp; k@@ de ;

x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g retri@@ eves the complete path from a file name without path input . file names in the same folder as the top@@ most loaded period file name with relative path to the working folder con x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g is possible , for example , a style template file .. / en / x@@ sl@@ doc@@ .x@@ s@@ l , the following entry is possible :
in this command , a partial or entire agreement with a description named my@@ ME or a given mode name is checked . &amp; eg ; template matches with any QNAP that contains the template template .
each nam@@ esp@@ ace in the specified &quot; my@@ ME &quot; is extended according to the rules specified in the nam@@ esp@@ ace defined in the X@@ SL source file ; x@@ s@@ l : test@@ 1 ; extended to ht@@ t@@ p : / / www.@@ w@@ 3.@@ org / 199 / X@@ SL / Trans@@ form : test@@ 1
a requested stop has to be resolved for the corresponding UR@@ I and line number . this is done automatically when loading the first template by x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g .

on systems with the installed Re@@ ad@@ line library , you can use the arrow keys to browse the previously executed commands by using the arrow keys .
multiple commands require more than one argument . quotation marks can be used to pass compound phrases as an argument . &amp; eg ; : using the &quot; break &amp; quot ; * _ BA@@ R _ @ quot ; &quot; argument will be a stop point in a file named &quot; break &amp; quot ; * _ BA@@ R _ @ quot ; . &quot;
template _ NA@@ ME : a valid name of a template that exists only from the ASCII characters 0x@@ 00 to 0x@@ 7@@ F . this name can be a completely qualified name such as &quot; x@@ s@@ l : tem@@ plat@@ e@@ Name . &quot;
fil@@ en@@ ame : a valid local file name on the user &apos;s system . on Unix or Cy@@ g@@ Win systems , the name may have the pre@@ fix &quot; ~ &quot; as a short form for the personal folder . other environment variables are also allowed on R@@ IS@@ C OS systems .
path : a path to change the working folder . on some operating systems , the pre@@ fix &quot; ~ &quot; will be replaced by the path to your personal folder .

there are many graphical tools to compare . so why &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; ? let me briefly explain why I wrote .
the merge was very complicated because one of the contribut@@ ors made many changes and at the same time had corrected the ind@@ entation at many places . another programmer had a lot of text in the same file . the result was numerous conflicts during mer@@ ging .
the program I used showed me only the changed lines , but I could not see what exactly changed within these lines . and there was no indication of the places where perhaps only the ind@@ entation had changed . mer@@ ging these changes was a minor night@@ mare .
this was the beginning . the first version of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; could represent differences within a line and changes to white characters . later , a lot of other useful functions were added .
for example , if you want to quickly compare text , simply copy it to the clip@@ board and paste it into one of the reference windows .
a function that did a lot of work was the comparing and mer@@ ging of folders . this function turned &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; almost into a full @-@ fle@@ dged file browser .
this is useful when two persons work independently of each other on a piece of code and make changes . the original file ( the base ) helps &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; automatically selecting the correct changes . in this editor you can even edit the result directly . in this editor you can even edit the result directly . the screen@@ shot shows three source files when mer@@ ging :
&amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; also helps you to merge and merge whole folders . this screen shot shows &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; in the folder merge :
&amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; displays the exact differences and deal with the possibilities of today &apos;s color monitors . if you frequently have to check code , you will like this function .
differences in white characters and tabs are displayed visible . if lines differ only in a certain number of white characters , one can see that at a glance at the summary in the column on the left side . ( no more trouble if somebody changes the ind@@ entation . )
if a file is equal , and the other differs in one line , then the color indicates which file is different . red color means that both files differ .
if all files have the same name but are located in different folders then you can ease typing by just writing the file name of the first file . example :
folders 2 folders , folder , folder , folder , folder , folder , folder , folder , folder , folder , folder , folder , folder , folder , folder , folder , folder
the Open dialog enables manual typing of file names , the selection of the file browser ( file ... ) or selecting a last opened file from the drop @-@ down list . the opening dialog tells your selection and displays them next time . you do not need to specify a third file ; if you leave the entry for C , the analysis of the differences with two files is performed .
by pressing the folder ... you can also select a folder . if you select a folder , the compar@@ isons and mer@@ ging of folders will be initiated . if a file is selected for A , but for B and C a folder , then use &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the file name from A in the two other folders .
if mer@@ ging is enabled , the input field will be active and can be edited . however , it is not absolutely necessary to immediately specify an output file . you can also do this later when saving .
the setup button opens a dialog with Settings . here you can specify options before you start comparing / mer@@ ging .
sometimes you don &apos;t want to compare a whole file , but only parts of a text . &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; allows you to drag text parts from the clip@@ board into the active settlement window . the comparison starts immediately . in the opening dialog you do not have to select files , you can simply close the dialog with the Cancel button .
you can also drag and drop : simply drag a file from a file manager or selected text from an editor and let it fall over a comparison window .
what is the idea behind it ? sometimes a file contains several similar functions . if you want to find out how similar these functions are , it would be a relatively big effort . you would have to create two corresponding files , load them in &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; then you can simply copy , paste and compare the relevant sections .
note : currently , you cannot remove anything from &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; just dropping text into a comparison window is supported .
warning : some editors interpret the dra@@ gging and placing of text into another program as cut and paste ( instead of copying and past@@ ing ) . in such a case , your original data could be lost .
in the upper part of each text window is the info line . the info line of the source window contains the characters A , B or C , the fil@@ en@@ ame and the line number of the first visible line in the window . ( note that window C is optional . ) Every Info line has a different color .
the three source windows are assigned the letters A , B and C . a has the color blue , B the color green and C is mag@@ enta . ( these default settings can be changed via the Settings menu . )
when a difference is recognized , one can see the color which differs from the file . if both files differ , the default color is red . ( color for conflict in the settings ) . the color scheme is particularly useful when comparing three files .
to the left of the text is the summary column . if differences were found , the column displays the corresponding color . in some programming languages , where white characters are not so important , it is useful to see only the relevant changes . ( for C / C + + , for example , white characters are only relevant in strings and comments , for the pre@@ processor and in a few rare cases . )
the vertical line separating the summary column from the text is interrupted at the places where the respective source file has no lines . if the line breaks are enabled , the line is shown with dotted lines .
the result window ( among the comparison windows ) also has an info line with the title output : , the fil@@ en@@ ame and &#91; Change &#93; if you have edited the result . usually it contains text by automatic mer@@ ging , but often it also contains conflicts .
! ! ! until all conflicts are resolved , saving is de@@ activated ! ! ! ( use the buttons to find the next resolved / un@@ solved conflict to find the remaining conflicts . )
if only two comparison windows are used , each difference at the same time is also a conflict that has to be solved manually .
by clicking with the left mouse button in the summary column in one of the windows , the group belonging to the row is highlighted in all windows and the first line of the group is displayed . this group will then be highlighted with the color background color for current area and each on the left appears a black bar .
sometimes there is no more line left in the group due to automatic mer@@ ging or manual editing ; this is only a plac@@ eholder in the event that you change your mind and perhaps still choose another source . this text does not appear in the final saved file , nor in a marking that you may copy and paste elsewhere .
the text &amp; lt ; merge conflict ; however , appears in the clip@@ board if you copy such text from the result window . carefully go with this function .
note : when selecting the sources , ignore the options Num@@ bers or Ign@@ ore C / C + + comments enabled , changes in numbers or comments are also treated as white characters .
navigate mainly with the scroll bars and mouse , but you can also use the keyboard . if you click in one of the windows , you can use the arrow keys left , right , high , down , page on , page starting , end , C@@ trl @-@ Start and C@@ trl @-@ End , Si@@ v as you can also use it from other programs .
in the Au@@ ction window , you can also use the other buttons to edit . with the insert button you can switch between insert and over@@ write mode . ( default is insert mode . )
a click with the left mouse button in one of the summary columns synchron@@ izes the view of all windows at the beginning of each group ( as explained in the merge section and the edi@@ table output window ) .
the toolbar contains seven buttons for navig@@ ating you to the current / first / last difference , the next / previous difference ( C@@ trl @-@ down / C@@ trl @-@ Up ) , to the next / previous conflict ( C@@ trl @-@ Up / C@@ trl @-@ Up ) or to the next / previous un@@ solved conflict .
to copy the selection to the clip@@ board , you need to press the Copy button ( C@@ trl @-@ C or C@@ trl @-@ In@@ sert ) . if this is enabled , whatever you mark , is automatically copied to the clip@@ board and eliminating manual copying . however , be careful because you could accidentally over@@ write the contents of the clip@@ board .
line ends are stored according to the underlying operating system . Unix flavors use a line feed character \ , and Win32 @-@ based systems use carriage return + new@@ line \ \ r \ . K@@ Diff@@ 3 does not keep the line ends of the source files , therefore you should use &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; also not with binary files .
the options and the list of recently used files will be saved automatically when you exit , and restored at the next start . ( Menu Settings &gt; K@@ Diff@@ 3 to set up ... )
select a font with fixed width . ( on some systems the dialog also provides fonts with variable width to choose from , but you should not use them . )
if you enable this option , differences in itali@@ c script will be displayed . if the selected script does not support this display , nothing happens .
on systems with only 16 or 256 colors , some colors could not be available in their pure form , but would be rendered ast@@ ray . on these systems the button pres@@ ets automatically set an odd color .
when this option is enabled , the corresponding number of spaces is inserted when pressing the Tab key . otherwise , a tab@@ ul@@ ator character is inserted .
if you press Enter or Return , the ind@@ entation of the previous line will be used automatically for the next line .
when this option is enabled , each selection is automatically copied to the clip@@ board . the manual copy to the clip@@ board then om@@ itted .
you can select which line @-@ end type you prefer to save . the default value is the generally common selection on the operating system used .
when comparing files , &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 attempts to find all fully identical lines in the source files . only during this first step , white characters can be ignored . the second step compar@@ es each line . in this step , white characters are not ignored .
some editors ( on some systems ) save a carriage return character &apos; \ \ r &apos; and a line feed &apos; \ &apos; at the end of a line , others save only one line feed &apos; \ &apos; . usually , the carriage returns are made visible , but the same as a white character . during mer@@ ging this option has to be disabled . in default this option is disabled .
in the first part of the analysis numbers and associated characters ( &apos; 0 &apos; - &apos; 9 &apos; , &apos; . &apos; , &apos; - &apos; ) are ignored . in the result , the differences are displayed , but they are treated as white characters .
by default , this option is disabled . changes in comments are treated like changes in white characters .
search intensively for even smaller differences . the option is enabled in default . it is effective in complicated and large files , but slow with very large files .
in automatic jump mode , this setting determines how long the result of the selection is displayed before the next un@@ solved conflict is going on .
this is useful when white characters are used as a source . ( default is manual selection . ) This is useful when white characters are less important in many files . if you only need this from time to time , then use the Cho@@ ose A / B / C for all un@@ resolved white conflicts from the merge menu . note that the Auto selection also affects conflict in numbers or comments if the options ignore numbers or Ign@@ ore C / C + + comments enabled .
these options are discussed in the chapter on the scanning of folders and exec@@ uting a merge . look for details under documentation for directory comparison and mer@@ ging .
if a file is stored and already exists an older version , the original version will be app@@ ended to the suff@@ ix .@@ ori@@ g . if such a backup file exists with the suff@@ ix .@@ ori@@ g , it will be deleted without further backup .
change the language of the user interface . changing this option does not affect the currently running program . you need to start &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; quit and restart , so that the change is active . ( this option is available in the K@@ DE version of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; not available because the language is set there globally via the control centre . )
the following encoding settings can be set separately for each entry . if you enable this option , the upper setting is used for all entries .
the selection fields for coding shows a short notice of what the local coding is . ( this cannot be changed here and has a purely informal character for you . )
adjust the file encoding for source files . this affects how special characters are treated and interpreted . since the encoding for each file is individually adjustable , even files with different encoding can be compared and merged .
if you have edited a file , you can specify which encoding is to be used for saving .
if you define pre @-@ processing commands , they might not work with your co@@ dec . ( for example , your files could be 16 @-@ bit Uni@@ code , but the pre @-@ processing command can only handle 8 @-@ bit ASCII . ) With this option you can specify the encoding of the output of pre @-@ processing commands .
turn this off to supp@@ ress high@@ lighting of changes in white characters in text or review columns . ( note : this also applies to changes in numbers or comments if the options ignore numbers or Ign@@ ore C / C + + comments enabled . )
this selection is only available if you compare three files . in normal mode , all differences are displayed in a color coded overview column . but sometimes you may only want to see the differences between two of three files . after selection of A &amp; lt ; gt ; C or B &amp; lt ; gt ; C will be displayed next to the normal yet another Super@@ sich@@ ts column with the information you need .
sometimes you prefer to use the available space on the screen for long lines . simply select the less important windows . ( this option is in the window menu . )
this can also be useful for displaying long lines . ( this option is in the window menu . )
sometimes you see the differences and then decide to merge the files . the current file mer@@ ges in the merge menu also works if you compare only two files . a simple click starts the merge and uses the file name of the last source file as default name for the output file . ( if this function is used to restart mer@@ ging , then the name of the last used output file will be retained . )
when reading a file , it is first committed to this external command . in &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 , then the output of the command becomes visible , not the file itself . you can write your own pre@@ processor that corresponds exactly to your needs . you can use this function e.g. to cut out disturbing parts or to correct the ind@@ entation .
when reading a file , it is passed first to this external command . if a normal pre @-@ processing command was specified ( see above ) , the output of the command is used only when the line is used . you can write your own pre @-@ processor , which corresponds exactly to your needs . each input line must have a corresponding output line .
the idea behind it is to give the user more flexibility in setting up the diff results . however , an external program is needed , and most users do not want to program this themselves . however , the good news is that in most cases sed or per@@ l is completely sufficient .
use this pre @-@ processing command for line counting to convert the input into capital letters : SE@@ D &apos;s / \ \ ( . * \ \ ) / \ \ U \ \ 1 / &apos; The \ \ 1 in the replace string refers to the found text in the first log pair . the \ \ U converts the found text into capital letters .
CVS and other version control systems use some keywords to automatically insert string generated strings ( info : / c@@ vs / keyword sub@@ stitution ) . all follow the same pattern $ \ \ _ BA@@ R _ log \ \ _ BA@@ R _ log \ \ _ BA@@ R _ log \ \ _ BA@@ R _ log \ \ _ BA@@ R _ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \
while you experiment with sed , you might start to understand it and perhaps you may even like these regular expressions . they are very useful because there are many programs that support very similar things .
ignor@@ ing numbers is actually an already built @-@ in function in K@@ Diff@@ 3 . but it is good as an example of a further pre @-@ processing command for line reconciliation . sed &apos;s / &#91; 0@@ 12@@ 3@@ 45@@ 67@@ 8@@ 9.@@ - &#93; / / g &apos; Every sign between &apos; &#91; &apos; and &apos; &#93; &apos; is a hit , and every hit is replaced by nothing , so virtually deleted .
sometimes you might want to perform several replac@@ ements at once . then you can use the sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on &apos; ; &apos; to separate the replac@@ ements from each other . example :
instead of used you can also use something else like per@@ l -@@ p -@@ e &apos;s / re@@ ge@@ x@@ p / re@@ ge@@ x@@ p / re@@ ge@@ x@@ p / re@@ ge@@ x@@ p / re@@ ge@@ x@@ p / re@@ ge@@ x@@ p / re@@ ge@@ x@@ p / re@@ ge@@ x@@ p / re@@ ge@@ x@@ p / re@@ ge@@ x@@ p / re@@ ge@@ x@@ p / re@@ ge@@ x@@ p / re@@ ge@@ x@@ p / re@@ ge@@ x@@ p / re@@ ge@@ x@@ p / re@@ ge@@ x@@ p / re@@ ge@@ x@@ p / re@@ ge@@ x@@ p / re@@ ge@@ x@@ p / re@@ ge@@ x@@ p / re@@ ge@@ x@@ p / re@@ ge@@ x@@ p / re@@ ge@@ x@@ p / re@@ ge@@ x@@ p / re@@ ge@@ x@@ p / re@@ ge@@ x@@ p / re@@ ge@@ x@@ p / re@@ ge@@ x@@ p / re@@ ge@@ x@@ p / re@@ ge@@ x@@ p / re@@ ge@@ x@@ p / re@@ ge@@ x@@ p / re@@ ge@@ x@@ p / re@@ ge@@ x@@ p / re@@ ge@@ x@@ p / re@@ ge@@ x@@ p / re@@ ge@@ x@@ p / re@@ ge@@ x@@ p / re@@ ge@@ x@@ p / re@@ ge@@ x@@ p / re@@ ge@@ x@@ p / re@@ ge@@ x@@ p / re@@ ge@@ x@@
the data after the normal pre@@ processor will be retained for viewing and mer@@ ging . other operations only change the data that the line balance Al@@ gor@@ y@@ th@@ mus sees .
note : in rare cases , if you use a normal pre@@ processor , the line @-@ off pre@@ processor will see the output of the normal processor as input .
the pre@@ processor commands are very useful , but as with any function that changes text or hide differences , you may not notice certain differences and in the worst case destroy important data .
often , program@@ mers need to edit a lot of files in a folder . for this reason , you can compare and merge whole folders in recur@@ sively .
... makes a proposal for each object to merge ; you can customize the proposal before the start ,
... can simulate the merge and display the simul@@ ated changes without really performing them ,
... execute selected actions either with all ( F@@ 7 key ) , or only with selected objects ( F@@ 6 key ) ,
this is very similar to comparing and mer@@ ging individual files . you only need to specify folders on the command line or in the dialog file .
if three folders are merged then folder 1 will be used as the base . if no destination folder was specified , uses &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; folder 3 as destination folder .
note that only the comparison of folders automatically starts , not mer@@ ging . to start mer@@ ging , you need to select the corresponding menu entry or press the F@@ 7 key . ( more details follow . )
while reading the folders , a small message window informs about current progress . if you cancel scanning the folders , only the files that have been compared to that date will be listed .
when scanning the folders is complete , shows &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; a list window with the results on the left , ...
each file and folder found during the scan is shown here in a tree . you can select an object with a simple mouse click .
the folder structure is usually folded up . you can open a folder by double @-@ clicking on the + / - , or by using the arrow keys for left / right . the directory menu includes two functions All sub@@ directories to open and all sub@@ directories to open or un@@ fold .
when double @-@ clicking on a file , the file comparison is started and a comparison window appears .
the icon in the Name column reflects the type of file in the first folder ( A ) . these types are possible :
if the file type is different in the other folders , then this is visible in the columns A / B / C and in the details pane to the selected object . in such a case , the clas@@ h action cannot be selected automatically . if the merge operation is started , you will be informed about problems of this type .
as shown in the picture above , the colors red , green , yellow and black are used in the columns A / B / C .
in identical entries , however , the color is identical , even if the age of the entries is different .
folders are considered identical if their entire contents are identical . then folders also have the same color . in folders , the age is in@@ significant for its color .
the idea for this color scheme is based on dir@@ diff . the colors reflect the colors of a leaf that is green , then yellow and later when it is old , red becomes red .
... A and C are identical , but not B : copy B ( or if B does not exist , delete the destination if it exists )
... A and B are identical but not C : copy C ( or if C does not exist , delete the target if it exists )
... B and C are identical , but not A : copy A ( or if A does not exist , delete the target if it exists )
... A , B and C do not have the same type of file ( e.g. when A a folder and B is a file ) : error : conflic@@ ting file types . as long as such er@@ ron@@ eous objects exist , mer@@ ging cannot be started .
... A and B do not have the same type of file ( e.g. when A a folder and B is a file ) : error : conflic@@ ting file types . as long as such er@@ ron@@ eous objects exist , mer@@ ging cannot be started .
the mode to synchron@@ ize is active if only two folders and no explicit target folder were specified and if the option synchron@@ ize directories is active . then select &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the necessary action , so that both folders are identical afterwards . if for an entry ...
... A and B exist , but not identical are : merge and save the result in both folders . ( the user sees as visible fil@@ en@@ ames for the output file only B ; directly after mer@@ ging &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; B to A. )
if two folders are merged and the option New file is enabled instead of mer@@ ging ( in@@ secure ) , then examine &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the date of the files and suggests the newer file to copy . if the files are different , but the same date appears , error message appears .
during mer@@ ging , one file is processed after another . it displays the status column if the merge has been successful , and accordingly other messages when something unexpected occurs . if mer@@ ging is complete , you should make a final check and see if the status is all right .
if in the setup dialog the file comparison method is selected Full Analysis , K@@ Diff@@ 3 will display more columns . these include the number of un@@ solved , deleted , non @-@ white and white conflicts . ( the resolved conflicts column is only displayed when three folders are compared or merged . )
you can either merge the currently selected entry ( file or odds ) , or all entries at once . if you have selected all joined @-@ up actions ( also in all sub@@ folders ) , you can start mer@@ ging .
please note : if you have not specified a destination folder , then in the three @-@ folder merge mode , C will be used as a target . in the two @-@ folder merge , B is chosen as the target and when synchron@@ izing A and / or B is used as the target .
if you have selected a destination folder , please check whether all entries should be in the destination folder , even in the folder structure . there are a number of options that might be ski@@ pped by certain entries . check these options to avoid unpleasant surprises :
to merge all entries : select directory merge / continue in the directory menu or press F@@ 7 ( the keyboard short@@ cut ) . to merge only the current entry , select action of the current element or press F@@ 6 .
if there are still invalid merge actions by conflic@@ ting file types , a message appears that indicates the incorrect elements . you can then select a valid action for them .
when you merge all entries , a dialog box appears with the options Sec@@ tions , Sim@@ ulate and Cancel .
select Sim@@ ulate if you want to see what would happen without the really changes made . you will then receive a detailed list of all actions .
&amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; then execute certain actions with all entries . if a manual intervention is necessary ( merge a single file ) , a merge window opens ( note the screen@@ shot ) .
if you are finished with a file , select restart / continue directory merge or press F@@ 7 . if you haven &apos;t saved yet , a corresponding dialog appears . then leads &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; its work continues with the next entry .
if &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; on a mistake , a message and detailed status information appears . at the end of the list you will see some error messages that will help you to avoid the cause of the problem . if you continue mer@@ ging ( F@@ 7 key ) , lets you try another action for the entry or solve the problem in a different way before you continue mer@@ ging .
if some entries have been merged individually , you notice &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; these entries ( in the current session ) do not go together again . even if the merge operation has been ski@@ pped or not saved , these entries are considered settled . only if you change the merge action , these entries are merged again .
the Settings menu of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; ( Set menu Settings - &gt; K@@ NO@@ 3 ... ) now has a section called Directory @-@ merge with these options :
only files matching the specified pattern are displayed in the el@@ em@@ ental @-@ tree . it can be entered multiple patterns . separate the patterns with a sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ; valid plac@@ eholder : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . ( e.g. * .@@ c@@ pp ; * .@@ h ) . the default is * . folders must not match this pattern .
files and folders that match this pattern are not displayed in the el@@ em@@ ental @-@ tree . it can be entered more than one pattern , use the sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ; as separ@@ ator . valid plac@@ eholder : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . default is * .@@ ori@@ g ; * .@@ o .
files and folders that match this pattern are not displayed in the el@@ em@@ ental @-@ tree . it can be entered more than one pattern , use the sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ; as separ@@ ator . valid plac@@ eholder : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . default is * .@@ ori@@ g ; * .@@ o .
ignor@@ es files that would be ignored by CVS too . many aut@@ op@@ tically generated files are ignored by CVS . the big advantage is that this folder can be configured with a .@@ c@@ v@@ sign@@ ore file . ( see info : / c@@ vs / c@@ v@@ sign@@ ore . )
in some file systems , files have a default attribute . in other file systems , a previous poin@@ t. marks a file as hidden . this option lets you decide whether these files should be shown in the el@@ em@@ ental @-@ tree or not . this option is turned on in default .
links to files : when the option is turned off , symbolic links are compared . if the option is turned on , the files will be compared , to which the links display . this is disabled in default .
for links to folders : if the option is turned off , the symbolic links are compared . if the option is turned on , the links like normal folders will be treated and recur@@ sively searched . ( note that &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 does not check for possible recur@@ sions . a link to a folder containing a link to itself would result in an infinite loop and &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; crashes . ) This option is switched off in default .
performs a full analysis of each file and displays the statistics columns . ( the number of deleted , un@@ resolved , non @-@ white and white conflicts . ) The full analysis is slower than a simple binary analysis , and considerably slower if applied to files that do not contain any text . ( enter a corresponding anti pattern . )
if you compare large folders over a slow network , it may be faster to compare the change date and file size . however , this speed advantage will cost you a certain amount of security . please use caution .
similar to the change date . there is no real comparison . the files are regarded as identical , if they are equal size . this can , for example , be useful when copying the modified time . please use caution . this option is switched off in the pres@@ et .
enable Synchron@@ ization mode when two folders are compared and no destination folder is specified . in this mode , the suggestions for mer@@ ging files are selected in such a way that both folders are identical afterwards . also the results of mer@@ ging files are stored in both folders . this option is switched off in the default .
if there are differences instead of mer@@ ging , copying the newer file is suggested as action . ( this is considered in@@ secure , as the knowledge is assumed that the other file has not been modified too . you should check this in any case . ) This option is disabled in default .
if a file or folder is replaced or deleted by another , the original version is renamed and receives the extension .@@ orig@@ . If an old backup file exists with the .@@ ori@@ g extension , it will be deleted without further backup . this also applies to the normal merge of individual files , not just the merge of entire folders .
normally , the folder merge view is visible while running single files ; you can move the window divi@@ der with the mouse . if you do not want it , you can switch the window divi@@ der into the main window in the window menu and switch between the directory and text window between the two views .
you can also create a single file directly without having to start the folder merge . you can also use the Current File Con@@ merge from the merge menu . as soon as you save the result , the status will be set to zero and the file will not be merged once you start the folder merge .
however , this status will be lost if you re @-@ read the directory : directory menu : read more
K@@ DE supports network transparency with the help of K@@ IO slaves . K@@ DE uses this to read files and folders . in this way , you can specify files and folders for opening files located on local or remote machines .
the first command line compar@@ es a local file with one on an FTP server . the second command line compar@@ es a folder within a compressed archive with a local folder .
a URL has a different syntax as local files and folders . a few things you should consider :
a path may be relative and@@ . or .. included . this is not possible with URLs , these are always absolute .
special characters must be mas@@ ked . ( # - &gt; % 23 , Space &gt; % 20 , etc . ) . for example , a file named / # fo@@ o # has the URL file : / % 23@@ fo@@ o % 23 .
sometimes due to the fil@@ esystem on the server , sometimes by the protocol used . it follows a short list of constraints :
or it cannot be distinguished whether a link to a file or folder shows . then a file is always assumed as a link target . ( FTP : , s@@ ft@@ p : ) .
there is no way to edit permissions or modification date . therefore , the permissions or the modification date devi@@ ate from the original . ( please note the default of the size . ) ( This is only possible with local files . )
the main purpose is currently in K@@ DE@@ V@@ EL@@ OP . K@@ DE@@ V@@ EL@@ OP always starts the built @-@ in differences viewer . to start K@@ DE@@ 3 , press the right mouse button on the difference viewer and then select In K@@ Diff@@ 3@@ Part display from the context menu .
usually requires &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; two full input files . if it is applied as a part , it takes &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; that the input file is a patch file in unified format . then remove &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the name of the original files from the patch file . then start &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the patch program to restore the missing file .
in the Kon@@ quer@@ or you can click on a patch file and select from the Con@@ text Menu Pre@@ view in - K@@ Diff@@ 3 Part . please note that this will not work if none of the original files exists . furthermore , this is un@@ reliable if the original files have changed since the patch file has been created .
when &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; as part is executed , it only supports comparing two files , a very small toolbar and menu . mer@@ ging or comparing folders is not supported in the K@@ Part mode .
tools with the name K@@ Di@@ ff and K@@ Diff@@ 2 already exist . furthermore , the name K@@ Diff@@ 3 already indicates that it can merge as the program diff@@ 3 from the Di@@ ff Tool collection .
I have been using GP@@ L programs for quite a long time and learned a lot by pe@@ ek@@ ing into the sources of other programs . this is my thank you to all program@@ mers who have walked this path or are going to go that way .
you compiled the program from the sources and probably didn &apos;t tell the configure script to K@@ DE . in default , configure in / usr / local , but then K@@ DE can &apos;t find the resources for the user interfaces ( e.g. k@@ diff@@ 3@@ u@@ i.@@ r@@ c ) . in the RE@@ AD@@ ME file you will find more information on this topic .
if only the number of white characters is different , these lines are treated as identical ; however , if only one non @-@ white character is different , the line is treated as not identical . i@@ F similar lines of next to each other , this is the right dence , but this is often the case .
the editor notes for any difference in the files where it starts and where it ends . however , this is necessary to solve a conflict simply by clicking in the source code and selecting the button A / B / C . however , this important information is lost when the result is simply stored as text file and it is too much effort to create an own file format that could store this information .
the effort is so far too big . you can always restore a certain version by selecting a source A / B / C . to edit larger amounts of text , another editor should be used .
after removal of text , suddenly , no sr@@ c is swe@@ pt ; and the text cannot be deleted . what does that mean and how can it be removed ?
&amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; uses many colors to emphasize differences . even more high@@ lighting would be conf@@ using and mis@@ ses the purpose . please use another editor for this .
many good ideas and bug reports came from colleagues and many people from the Wild Wild Web . thank you !
to be able to use all functions of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; you need &amp; k@@ de ; 3.1 or newer .
information on how to use K@@ Diff@@ 3 on other platforms without K@@ DE can be found on the homepage .
a list of recent changes can be found in ht@@ t@@ p : / / k@@ diff@@ 3.@@ sourc@@ e@@ for@@ ge@@ .net / Ch@@ ange@@ Log or in the Ch@@ ange@@ Log file in the source package .
to compile and install ; on a system with &amp; k@@ de ; to compile and install , use the following command in the base folder of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; -@@ Distribution :
K@@ DE @-@ dir specifies the folder in your system where K@@ DE is installed . if you are unsure , you will find more details in the RE@@ AD@@ ME file .
since &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 , auto@@ conf and autom@@ ake are used , you should not have any problems with comp@@ iling . if you still encounter difficulties , please refer to the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ mailing lists .
cut out ( C@@ trl @-@ X or Shift @-@ Remove ) copied to the clip@@ board and del@@ etes the selected text . insert ( C@@ trl @-@ V or Shift @-@ paste ) paste text from the clip@@ board to the current cursor position or replace the current marker .
only show differences : files that are identical in all folders will not appear in the folder structure , and therefore not in the destination folder .
( in the current program version you need to re @-@ read the folder with the Update function after changes to these options . )
this also means that identical files will not be copied to the destination folder during mer@@ ging . if the destination folder does not already contain these files , they will be missing after mer@@ ging . ( the behavior will probably be changed in a later program version . ) This option is switched off in default .
note the buttons for selecting the source with the A , B and C labelling below the menu bar . if you click on one of the buttons , the rows from the corresponding window will be attached to the end of the selected group in the result window ( if they are not already present ) .
in default this option is disabled . differences in individual characters ( such as &apos; A &apos; and &apos; a &apos; ) are treated like differences in white characters .
the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; shows a mini preview of all virtual des@@ kt@@ ops . it is quite practical to see the running programs on the working surfaces , change their size , quit them or post@@ p@@ one them . this works both inside a desktop and in several .
the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; can display all virtual des@@ kt@@ ops as well as the applications running in it . applications can be selected and moved even on the desktop and to others .
with the middle mouse button , Windows can be moved within &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; the movement is possible both within a desktop and on other working areas .
the context menu will depend on where the right mouse button is cli@@ cked : if on the empty background of &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; cli@@ cked , the context menu has only the two entries P@@ ager to set up ... and exit . if however , the icon and name of the application and the entries Minim@@ ize , Maxim@@ ize , On Desktop and Finish . the commands do the following :
maxim@@ izes the application window to the full size of the desktop . only appears when cli@@ cked on an application .
sends the application to the selected virtual desktop . only appears when cli@@ cked on an application .
if this check box is selected , Windows can be moved within the &amp; c@@ p@@ ager ; s with the middle mouse button on the desktop and also to other work@@ tops .
when this field is selected , the names of the virtual des@@ kt@@ ops are displayed in the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager .
tick this field lets the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; display the numbers of virtual des@@ kt@@ ops . if it is selected along with name , the names are provided with folder numbers , &amp; eg ; 1st desktop .
if this field is selected , the background of each desktop will be displayed as background in &amp; p@@ ager .
when this field is checked , the running programs are displayed as small windows in &amp; p@@ ager ; otherwise only empty work@@ spaces are displayed to enable their selection .
here the view of the program window is selected . simply shows simple rect@@ angles with the proportions of the program window . icon shows the window with its standard symbol and Pix@@ map displays a small view of the actual program window . re@@ mark : Pix@@ map is recommended only for very fast systems .
here the arrangement of the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; main window can be determined : classi@@ cally &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; in a 2x@@ N grid , as is known from P@@ ager applications in some other window managers ; horizontally , all virtual des@@ kt@@ ops are displayed horizontally and vertical in a vertical row , which is very well suited for viewing on the desktop .
the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; can be used as an alternative to the P@@ ager mini program in the control bar . it has the advantage that it can be changed in size that can display and move windows as symbols or with their content . furthermore , it runs outside the control bar .
right click within &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; and then set up sel@@ ector switch ... allows the dialog box to appear .
currently this cannot be changed in the Settings dialog . but you can do this manually :
open the file $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / config / k@@ pag@@ err@@ c with any text editor such as &amp; ke@@ dit ; or vi@@ . if you do not have a write permission for the file , you must log in as user root or contact your system administrator .

this application is interesting for different users : artists , web designers and people with visual impair@@ ment . this documentation should be a complete manual for the use of &amp; c@@ mag .
&amp; C@@ mag ; is a very powerful application that is constantly extended by new features . it is optimized for use on low @-@ performance computers .
if you like &amp; k@@ mag , a window appears as shown above . the main window of &amp; k@@ mag ; displays the enlarged area of the screen . in the following , this window is referred to as the magni@@ fication window . the image shown in the magni@@ fication window is an enlarged area of the screen and is referred to as a selection window .
in the default setting , you may enlarge the area around the mouse poin@@ ter like a moving magni@@ fying glass . alternatively , you may or may be able to display a selected screen area in the magni@@ fication window or the surroundings of the mouse poin@@ ter at the edge of the screen ( eg ; at the left edge of the screen ) .
if you want to avoid that the mouse poin@@ ter is displayed in the enlarged window , select the position of the mouse poin@@ ter . please note that this may not be able to detect the shape of the mouse poin@@ ter . this is always the standard node ; / Q@@ t ; -@@ mouse poin@@ ter .
in the selection window mode , you can adjust the selection window to your own needs . you can move it with the arrow keys and mouse buttons and change its size . this can be done in the following way :
move the mouse poin@@ ter in the magni@@ fication window and hold the left mouse button pressed , so you can capture and move the content of the magni@@ fication window . this also works with the arrow keys .
in addition , if you press the &amp; Shift key , or use the &amp; M@@ MB ; you can move the selection window .
with this combination you can change the size of the selection window . note that the upper left corner of the drop @-@ down window remains fixed and only the lower right corner is to be moved .
you can send the enlarged picture directly to the printer , save into a file , copy it to the clip@@ board ( to insert it into other applications later ) , turn the picture and much more .
start or stop the update of the ad . stopping the update causes the required CPU time to go against 0 .
select the refresh rate ( Very low , Ger@@ ing , Medium , High , Very High ) . the higher the refresh rate , the more CPU time is needed .
in this mode , a select window will be displayed . the selected area is displayed in a window .
&amp; k@@ mag ; automatically uses your set short commands to store files , open a new window , print , rel@@ o@@ ad ( with the button document re@@ charge in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; ) , En@@ large and size &amp; etc ; .
it may also be known as a magni@@ fier ; it is a screen motion . you can use a magni@@ fier to enlarge the area of the screen , as if you are using a magni@@ fier to view the small print in a newspaper or a photo . this application is useful for different people : from research or artist to web designer or visual han@@ dicap .

&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; emul@@ ates a mouse click , as soon as the mouse poin@@ ter per@@ si@@ sts on the same spot . it is meant to help people suffering from R@@ SI syndrome ( repeti@@ tive pen@@ guin disorder ) , and every mouse @-@ click pain prepares pain .
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; emul@@ ates a mouse click , as soon as the mouse poin@@ ter per@@ si@@ sts on the same spot . it is meant to help people suffering from repeti@@ tive punishment ( R@@ SI ) syndrome , and each mouse @-@ click pain . moreover , it can em@@ ulate pulling with the mouse . this requires a little practice .
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; can handle pain caused by mouse clicks and helps many people to use the computer without pain . unfortunately , pain caused by the mouse will also cause pain . if you suffer from pain associated with your computer &apos;s use , you should consult a doctor if this has not happened yet .
to clarify this again : even if &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; avoid pain caused by clicking with the mouse , it is useless against pain caused by moving the mouse . and as with all ergonomic aids , the result can be different for everyone .
the use of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; is simple : &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; monitors your mouse movements and takes a mouse click away as soon as you pause the movement briefly .
if the smart move is activated , make &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; a pause after pressing the mouse button em@@ ulated . move the mouse , wait until the end of the motion before releasing the mouse button . in this way , you can drag the dra@@ gging with pressed mouse button . the intelligent move requires a little practice , but you get used to it quickly .
this residence time must pass after the end of the mouse movement before &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; a mouse click exec@@ utes .
if the Intel@@ li@@ gent@@ es move is enabled , the shooting field will be activated ( 1 / 10 s ) . here the time is set , the &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; after shut@@ down the mouse button wa@@ its before releasing the mouse button again , if no moving of the mouse occurs in the meantime .
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; now supports the click by mouse shift . if this feature is enabled , a slow move to the right and back , followed by a pause , a click with the right mouse button . this moves are stored in the file $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool _ stro@@ k@@ es.@@ txt , if &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; the first time it is started , but can be changed later .
if the sound appears delayed , you can reduce the response time . to do this , go to Sound &amp; Multimedia , select Sound &amp; Multimedia , select Sound System and here the tab General . there is a sli@@ der tone buffer that you set to a lower value to shor@@ ten the response times .
if this setting is selected , it will start &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; at each start of &amp; k@@ de ; this function is currently only available at &amp; k@@ de ; for G@@ NO@@ ME or other window environments , please consult the respective documentation to find out how to start a program there automatically .
set all settings to the values set when the dialog is opened . if you have already de@@ pressed the Apply button , the settings will be reset to the last pressing of Apply .
best use &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; first with the pres@@ ets . in particular , the intelligent move should let you off first . if you are used to the automatic mouse click , you can later accept the intelligent move .
if you use the audi@@ ble click it is necessary to reduce the response times of &amp; k@@ de ; in case of sounds .
first , you should be aware of which places a mouse click remains without effect : clicking on the neutral parts of windows or in the browser window that does not display a link does not lead to unwanted reactions . you can therefore park the mouse at such places until you want to use them again .
if your mouse bu@@ cks , you should clean your mouse . this is usually quite simple . the trick is that you do not only clean the mouse ball , but also the roles that come into contact with the mouse ball .
first you have to take the mouse ball out . as that happens , mouse to mouse is different , but it should be clear when you look at the bottom of the mouse .
if you have removed the ball , you would have to see the rolls . these are located on the sides of the hole in which the ball was inserted . the dirt and the dirt can easily scra@@ pe off with a flat blade or the f@@ ing@@ ern@@ ails .
in very rare situations , the operating system interrup@@ ts the execution of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; if you are using an intelligent move in this case , this means that &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; the operation can no longer be terminated by releasing the mouse button .
this happens when you &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; use under another window manager and move a window .
the solution for this problem is that you can run a mouse click yourself . this will reset the status of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; and you can continue working as usual .
problem : if you enter text , try &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; continue to execute mouse clicks and set the cursor to another location .
solution : use the mouse to place the cursor here where you want it . but park your mouse on a neutral area of the desktop , if you want to make a keyboard input . this can cause accidental mouse clicks to cause unwanted reactions . safe zones for the mouse poin@@ ter are &amp; eg ; the gray areas around the toolbar and menus and the title lines of windows .
I try to work with intelligent post@@ p@@ one , but I don &apos;t manage to edit text .
the intelligent move is an advanced function of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; and it takes its time before you can handle it . it is very likely possible in this way to mark text , copy it to the clip@@ board , or execute any other action in which you want to move the mouse with pressed mouse button . here are some advice :
do not use the intelligent move if you just start using &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; instead , select text as follows : execute at one end of the text area a mouse click and hold the Shift key pressed while you move the mouse cursor to the other end of the text and press the mouse button again .
use the audi@@ ble mouse click . this is played every time , when &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; the mouse button expresses a sound like a mouse click . later , you know exactly when when the smart move is moving , you can also use the smart move without the mouse click . but you need some practice to do so .
to be able to use &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; use the X@@ Test extension for &amp; X Window ; it should be the case on most systems already .
the functionality of the audi@@ ble mouse clicks is only available if the system has a sound card and speakers and is correctly set up .
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; activate the mouse button as soon as the mouse poin@@ ter per@@ si@@ sts . this program has been developed for people who suffer from R@@ SI syndrome and cause pain of the mouse buttons .
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; can also be configured to wait for a specific time to start a pulling process before releasing the mouse button . thus , drag and drop can be done with the mouse .

&amp; Por@@ ts@@ mouth ; is a program that allows the dum@@ b user to let their computer speak for themselves .
with the program &amp; c@@ law , silent users can let the computer speak for themselves . the user can choose from a list with the conversation history that should be spoken again .
on the first page of the wizard ( left screen@@ shot ) , enter the command that will be used later for the speech output of text . for more details , see the description of the setup dialog .
on the second page , you can choose the default text pass@@ book . from the Text@@ pas@@ sage@@ way , you can select often used text passages without having to type them . the text passages can of course be edited .
on the third page ( right screen shot ) you determine the dictionary for word completion . &amp; k@@ mouth ; reads the K@@ DE documentation of the chosen language to determine the frequency of each word . in addition , you can match the word lists with an Open@@ Offic@@ e.@@ org dictionary so that only correctly sp@@ elled words are added to the word of words .
the main window of &amp; c@@ mouth is clear and essentially contains an input field for the keyboard input of your sentences ( the bottom white field in the screen@@ shot ) and a memory channel of the already spoken sentences ( the upper white field in the screen@@ shot ) .
when you have k@@ mouth , you can enter the sentences you want to hear in the input field . each spoken sentence is attached to the course memory . you can select phrases to be spoken again .
with the menu entry Settings k@@ mouth ; set up ... open the settings dialog from &amp; c@@ mouth ; this dialog contains two flash@@ cards , voice output and settings , the Wor@@ ter@@ gän@@ ger page as well as the page K@@ TT@@ SD language service .
in the input field of the map menu , enter the command to call the language generator . in the selection field below the input field you specify the character encoding that will be passed on to the voice generator .
&amp; Por@@ ts@@ mouth ; knows two ways to pass the text . select the check box if the text is to be passed unchanged as standard input to the voice generator .
if the check box is not selected , the text will be passed on as a parameter . you can use the following plac@@ eholders :
of course , the command for voice output depends on your voice generator . you will find this command in the documentation on your voice generator . examples for this can be found in the app@@ endi@@ x .
with possible kt@@ ts@@ d as a language service will use &amp; k@@ mouth ; first try to pass the text to the K@@ TT@@ SD language service . if this is successful , the other settings on this page will be ignored . the kt@@ ts@@ d language service is a &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ da@@ emon , the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ Applications a standardized interface for voice output , and which is currently being developed in the SV@@ N .
with the first selection box action following the selection of a text passage you determine which action is triggered by the keyboard short@@ cut or by selecting a text passage in the Text passage book or in the bar for text pass@@ books .
with the selection of Instant Cont@@ ents the chosen text passage is spoken directly and additionally inserted into the default memory . with the selection of In the input field , the chosen text passage is first entered into the input field .
with the second drop @-@ down box closing the editing window for text pass@@ book , you can specify whether the text pass@@ book should be automatically saved when closing the editing window .
save the book with the selection of text pass@@ book . if you choose to disc@@ ard changes , the text pass@@ book will not be saved .
the Wor@@ ter@@ gän@@ ger page contains a list of dic@@ tion@@ aries for word completion . in the main window alongside the input field shows &amp; k@@ mouth ; a selection box if this list contains more than one dictionary . with this selection box , you can choose the dictionary which is currently used .
with the buttons to the right of the page , you can delete or add dic@@ tion@@ aries , change the order of the books or export them to a file . below the list , you can set the language for the dictionary in the input field and in the selection box .
for this source , select the desired language ; &amp; Por@@ ts@@ mouth ; then reads &amp; k@@ de ; the frequency of the single words is simply determined by counting the occurrence . additionally , you can compare the wor@@ d@@ list with an Open@@ Offic@@ e.@@ org dictionary to insert only properly written words into the new dictionary .
with this option you can merge the available dic@@ tion@@ aries . &amp; k@@ mouth ; then asks which dic@@ tion@@ aries are merged , and how they should be weigh@@ ted .
with this option , insert a new , empty dictionary without entries . da &amp; k@@ mouth ; newly entered words automatically insert into the dictionary , create a dictionary with your vocabulary over time .
the main area of the window for editing text pass@@ books is divided into two . in the upper part , the text pass@@ books are shown as tree structure .
in the lower part you can edit a selected entry . if you have selected a text passage , you can change the text passage or the associated keyboard short@@ cut . if you have selected a text pass@@ book , you can only change its name .
you can either add actions like new text passages or books , or delete selected text passages and books , either by selecting the menu bar , toolbar or drop @-@ down menu .
you can change the order of text passages or text passages by dra@@ gging the mouse to the new location or using the arrow keys and the &amp; Alt key .
the selected text is cut out and copied to the clip@@ board . if a text section is selected in the input field , it is used , otherwise the selected area of the run @-@ up memory .
the selected text is copied to the clip@@ board . if a text section is selected in the input field , it will be used , otherwise the selected area of the memory cache .
the currently active proposition is spoken . if there is a text in the input field , it is used , otherwise the selected sentences of the course memory .
if this menu item is selected , a sliding toolbar with buttons for frequently used commands is displayed . by default , the toolbar can be moved directly from the editing pane under the menu bar . by clicking on the sli@@ d left side and drag the toolbar can be moved to another location .
if this menu entry is checked , a narrow bar is displayed in the lower part of the main window with instructions about the status of &amp; c@@ mouth ; if not checked , this status bar is hidden .
if this menu entry is selected , a sliding bar is displayed for text pass@@ books with entries . by default , the bar is located above the editing pane directly under the toolbar . by clicking on the sli@@ d left side and dra@@ gging the toolbar can be moved to another place .
probably you have not entered the command for voice output properly or not completely . open Settings k@@ mouth ; set up ... , open the General Settings page and enter the command for voice output on the map speech output . ( see Settings dialog for voice syn@@ thesizer for more details . )
the festival is a speech output system at the University of Edinburgh . currently only English , Spanish and Wel@@ sh are supported . the license allows you to use the festival free of charge and without any restrictions .
to show an example of the command line for setting the voice output , it is assumed that the festival is installed in the / usr / local / festival folder . the command for voice output then reads :
Free@@ T@@ TS is a language generator written in &amp; Java . currently , it only supports the English pron@@ unciation . the license allows to use Free@@ T@@ TS free of charge and to spread without restrictions .
to show an example of the command line for setting up voice output , it is assumed that Free@@ T@@ TS is installed in the / usr / local / fre@@ et folder . the speech output is then possible with one of the three following command examples :
for the third example , the option must be enabled as standard input . ( this is the recommended example for the application of Free@@ T@@ TS . )
MB@@ RO@@ LA is a voice generator for many languages . it converts a list of phon@@ em@@ es into a Wav@@ ed@@ at@@ ei , so you need an additional program to dis@@ assemble the text in phon@@ em@@ es . the license allows to use MB@@ RO@@ LA free for non @-@ commercial and non @-@ military applications .
in our example , H@@ adi@@ fax is used to convert the German text to phon@@ em@@ es for MB@@ RO@@ LA , assuming that H@@ adi@@ fax and MB@@ RO@@ LA installed in / usr / local / hadi@@ fax and / usr / local / MB@@ RO@@ LA .
unfortunately H@@ adi@@ fax likes to swal@@ low the last character of the text , so that an additional character must be added . therefore , the complete command is more complex than in the other examples :

the speech output da@@ emon from &amp; k@@ de ; ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) is a language service that provides all &amp; know ; applications a standard interface for voice output . K@@ TT@@ SD is currently being developed in the SV@@ N . it uses modules to support different voice output systems .
since the voice generator setting is performed only in the K@@ TT@@ SD , you only need to use kt@@ ts@@ d as a language service in &amp; c@@ mouth .
for setting , use the K@@ TT@@ SD language service page that appears in the Settings dialog from &amp; c@@ mouth , when K@@ TT@@ SD is installed .
to successfully use , you need a voice generator ( and of course &amp; k@@ de ; 3.@@ x ) . &amp; Por@@ ts@@ mouth ; requires about 15 MB of memory ( and additionally memory for the voice generator ) , but it depends on your computer and its configuration .
&amp; Por@@ ts@@ mouth ; is an application that allows people who are not able to talk to output text by the computer . a list of already saved sentences can be saved , which the user can always re@@ write .
note that &amp; c@@ law does not include a voice syn@@ thesizer . a voice syn@@ thesizer must be installed on the computer .

&amp; kt@@ ts ; - the voice output system by &amp; k@@ de ; - is a module of existing service that allows every application to read text about the &amp; d@@ bus ; interface .
&amp; kt@@ ts ; is a part system in &amp; k@@ de ; for voice output ( T@@ TS ) . it provides a common application interface for &amp; k@@ de ; program@@ mers who can be equipped with their applications with T@@ TS capabilities .
reading texts ( or parts thereof ) in the text editor &amp; k@@ ate ; , even if &amp; k@@ ate ; in other &amp; small ; -@@ applications embedded .
the speech output is provided by the speech @-@ disp@@ at@@ cher program , which uses various background music like es@@ peak , festival , etc .
allows the creation of voice output on the command line ( or with shell scripts ) via the &amp; q@@ d@@ bus ; -@@ utility .
in Z@@ U@@ K@@ UN@@ FT : support for Spe@@ ech Mark@@ up languages such as Vo@@ ic@@ e@@ XML , S@@ able , &amp; Java ; Spe@@ ech Mark@@ up Language ( J@@ S@@ ML ) , and Spe@@ ech Mark@@ up Met@@ a Language ( SM@@ ML ) .
the voice output service of &amp; k@@ de ; , an application without visible windows that offers T@@ TS services via &amp; d@@ bus ;
an application with &amp; GUI ; to configure and set up kt@@ ts@@ d on kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr in the system section .
a module for web browser and kon@@ quer@@ or ; for reading texts from a website or parts thereof .
a module for the text editor &amp; k@@ ate ; with which a text file can be read completely or partially .
in addition to the Bug@@ z@@ illa database of &amp; k@@ de ; ( ht@@ t@@ p : / / bu@@ gs@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org / ) you can find the section about ht@@ t@@ ps : / / mail@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org / mail@@ man / list@@ info / k@@ de @-@ accessibility .
before you can use it , you need to install and set up a speech disp@@ at@@ cher program .
for the first start of kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr or as long as no speakers are set up , the card card speaker is shown . see also . if you have at least one speaker installed , the card board is shown in General . see .
most T@@ TS syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers offer different languages and voices , so different types of male or female , or those that differ in volume or speed . you can also set up multiple versions for a syn@@ thesizer . you should at least set up a speaker before you use &amp; t@@ ts , since the program uses high @-@ speed disp@@ at@@ chers otherwise the standard speaker .
different speakers for the same syn@@ thesizer are comparable to several printer sp@@ lines for the same printer .
when you click on the tabs Man Spe@@ aker in kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr , the card card will be displayed . it will also appear automatically when you start kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr and no speaker is set up yet .
all speakers already set up appear in this list . the preferred speakers appear above in the list . the top speaker is used for voice output if an application does not present a speaker .
select a speaker from the list with a mouse click , and click on this button to remove the speaker from the list .
select a speaker from the list with a mouse click , and click on this button to change the settings . see below .
select a speaker from the list with a mouse click , and click on this button to move the speaker in the list one line further down . the order of the speakers in the list also determines their priority .
click on one of these buttons to apply your changes to the current &amp; kt@@ ops ; system .
select a voice type , there are three male and three female voices as well as a boys and girls voice to choose from .
to change the settings of this speaker , click Edit .
now you can use &amp; kt@@ ts ; almost use it . go back to the map General and check whether voice output is enabled ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) to start the T@@ TS service from &amp; k@@ de ; see . now you can use &amp; kt@@ ops ; use to create and manage text orders . see .
if you have at least one speaker installed , you can start the language distribution system from &amp; k@@ de ; click the General tab to open this tab . here you can set some general options .
check this check box to enable the &amp; kt@@ ops ; this starts the K@@ DE @-@ T@@ TS service ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) . if this start is successful , the card will display orders and you can create and read text orders . see . remove the marking , K@@ TT@@ SD is stopped and the T@@ TS system from &amp; k@@ de ; de@@ activated .
if kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr is terminated , running &amp; t@@ ts ; further , if the field is enabled ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) .
if this check box is selected and kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr appears automatically in the system area of the control bar , it disappears again as soon as the reading is completed .
with the buttons in this series you can start , pause , pause and resume text orders .
with the buttons in this series you can read the current text in the &amp; k@@ de ; clip@@ board or open a text file to read . you can also change the speaker for an assignment .
click Apply or OK , then all changed settings will be applied to all pages .
the card card orders are only displayed when K@@ TT@@ SD is started . to start K@@ TT@@ SD , click the General tab and check the box ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) .
in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; , the web browser of &amp; k@@ de ; , you can read the text of the displayed web page . then check the text that is to be read , and select the text to read in the main menu Tools text . after a short time , the voice output should begin .
it is almost always sensible to select the desired text of a website . you can also skip this step , but then many &amp; HTML ; -@@ pre @-@ tension@@ ing lines and other invisible marks are also read .
in &amp; k@@ ate ; the advanced text editor of &amp; k@@ de ; , you can read the displayed text . then check the text to be read , and select the text to read in the main menu Tools text . then the voice output should begin .
this also works if &amp; k@@ ate ; embedded in other applications , such as &amp; eg ; in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; or in &amp; Qu@@ anta ; .
K@@ Noti@@ fy is the message system by &amp; k@@ de , which informs you about events that you &apos;ve set up . you can read the text of these messages also by &amp; kt@@ ts .
in &amp; Con@@ vers@@ ation ; , the I@@ RC program by &amp; k@@ de ; you can set up various types of messages . for example , you can set up that you will be notified when a message appears in an I@@ RC channel in which your nick@@ name appears . with &amp; kt@@ ops , you can then read the I@@ RC message text .
supports a &amp; k@@ de ; program K@@ Noti@@ fy , a menu item appears al@@ erts in the Settings menu of this program . the possible settings for K@@ Noti@@ fy differ depending on the application .
the file k@@ mail@@ .x@@ ml which belongs to the scope of delivery of &amp; kt@@ ts is a good example . it removes the tags b@@ r and b from the messages sent by mail , and also the expression / local / in@@ box , since it can be assumed in most cases as provided .
filters are one of the advanced abilities of &amp; kt@@ ts ; for normal work with &amp; kt@@ ts ; filters are not required .
text is edited in filters before it is sent to the speech disp@@ at@@ cher . they are useful for improving pron@@ unciation in order to replace false spoken words or abbrevi@@ ations , select a suitable language and speaker or to avoid certain defici@@ encies of voice syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers and their voices .
to understand how filters work , it is important to know how the program &quot; speech @-@ disp@@ at@@ cher &quot; works with a text . &amp; kt@@ ats ; distinguishes four types of texts .
the output of screen readers has the highest priority . it is preferred to all other orders and keeps these orders . if the output of the screen reader is read , the sustained orders will be resum@@ ed .
warnings have the next priority . this level is important news such as &amp; eg ; processor gets too hot . a warning has priority and keeps the output of messages and normal text .
messages have the highest priority . a message interrup@@ ts normal text . &amp; k@@ mouth ; is an example of an application that uses messages . while you &amp; eg ; read a long text on a website , you can start &amp; k@@ mouth ; noti@@ fications are also messages . read about this .
the rest are simple text orders . any order that you inf@@ use from the card list is a text order . K@@ S@@ ay@@ it is an example of an application that uses text orders . text orders are meant for the output of longer texts , which do not have any particular ur@@ gency .
all four types of orders are processed in queu@@ es , except for the output of screen readers . if an application sends the output of a screen reader during and kt@@ ats , this output is stopped and stopped .
first you need to know that filters are never applied to the output of screen readers . they are applied to normal warnings , messages and text orders as well as to &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ messages .
filter the text and pass it on to the next filter . currently there are three types of filters .
filters are designed as modules . in the future , there may be further types of filters .
string Trans@@ lators replace parts of a text by other text . the parts to replace can be supplied either as words or as regular expressions . &amp; kt@@ ts ; is supplied with predefined string substitute filters , which allow the creation of chat emoti@@ cons such as : - ) by text or for format@@ ting messages from &amp; con@@ ges@@ tion ; or &amp; k@@ mail ; in a better understandable form .
&amp; XML ; conver@@ ters use an X@@ S@@ LT file ( XML ; Style Language - Trans@@ forms ) to convert &amp; XML ; from one format to another format . included in &amp; kt@@ ts ; are some X@@ S@@ LT files for translation of &amp; X@@ HTML ; included in SS@@ ML .
with subscri@@ ber selection filters you can send orders depending on the content of the text or depending on the program that sent the text to &amp; kt@@ ts ; sent to a speaker for example . if you have set a female voice for example on the card card speaker , you can read text from K@@ DE messages about it .
each of these filters has adjustable rules , after which it is applied to a speech output . if the filter states that its rules do not apply , it continues the text unchanged to the next filter .
when a text order , a message , warning or a &amp; k@@ de ; notification to &amp; kt@@ ts ; is sent , it is processed by all activated filters that have been set up on the page below . processing by the filters is carried out in the order in the list from top to bottom .
this shows the list of normal filters set up . if a filter is not checked , it is not activated and is not used . filters are turned down@@ wards from top to bottom .
click here to insert a new filter . select the type of filter and it will display the below setup di@@ alogs .
for setting string replacement filters , you need to enter a list of words or regular expressions as comparison patterns . if these patterns are found in the text , the text is exchanged for the corresponding replacement text .
enter a name for your filter . you can select this name as you like , it only has to differ from the names of the other filters .
this is the list of words and regular expressions . the filter compar@@ es the text with the strings in the column agreement and replaces it in accordance with the string from the column Er@@ ase . the list is processed in the displayed order from top to bottom .
click here to move the selected word or expression in the list .
with these buttons , you can load a list of words or regular expressions from a file , save or delete the current list . load a list from a file , the entries from the file will be attached to the existing list .
if a language is entered here , the filter is used only if the speaker speaks one of the languages listed here . click the button to display a list of languages . you can also select multiple languages if you click the &amp; C@@ trl key at the click of the mouse .
if a value is entered here , the filter will only be applied when the text comes from one of the specified applications . you can enter several programs separated by comm@@ a . example : conversation , k@@ mail
you can get the application ID running programs with the program q@@ d@@ bus ; The &amp; d@@ bus ; numbers must be om@@ itted . if for example &amp; q@@ d@@ bus ; the application ID copied @-@ 34@@ 32 indicates , you may only enter copies .
the string replacement filter is applied only to the text if all conditions apply with an entry in the box Di@@ esen Filter when matching . if all input fields are empty , the filter is applied to all texts .
when comparing words , the string replacement filter uses regular expressions in the form \ \ s word \ \ s. so the words must be limited to both sides by separ@@ ator ( spaces ) .
in this manual , you will find no instructions for writing regular expressions . but if you have installed the &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; regular &amp; # 160 ; regular &amp; # 160 ; regular &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; Reg@@ ular &amp; # 160 ; expressions can be found in the package ambig@@ u@@ ls .
XML ; Trans@@ former transl@@ ates &amp; XML ; with the help of X@@ S@@ LT files from a format to another format . X@@ S@@ LT ( XML ; Style Language - Trans@@ forms ) is a W3@@ C standard for such conver@@ sions . it can only be applied to well formed XML . the x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c utility must be installed on your system .
enter the path for the program x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c . if x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c is reachable via the environment variable PAT@@ H , x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c is also sufficient .
with the Spe@@ aker selection filter , you can send texts to a specific speaker that is set up on the card board speaker , or to a speaker with specific features . for example , you can specify that text by k@@ mail should be read by a female voice .
before &amp; kt@@ ats ; passes a text to the filter , it looks for a spokes@@ man for the text . the speaker is selected based on the speaker properties that the program specifies the text to &amp; kt@@ ts ; the speaker can over@@ write the selected speaker using the speaker &apos;s selection filter .
if a value is entered here , the filter will be applied if the text contains the entered regular expression . is on your system the &amp; K@@ de ; editor &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; regular &amp; # 160 ; terms installed , you can call this by clicking on the button to get help when entering .
to achieve faster processing , you should try to anchor the regular expression at the beginning of the string , i.e. , start the regular expression with &lt; ! &#91; C@@ DATA &#91; ^ &#93; &#93; &gt; .
specify the characteristics of the speaker you want . if the text meets the filter conditions shown above , the speaker is selected to match the desired requirements . click the button on the right to see the dialog box selection .
use these buttons to save or load your voice settings or to delete all settings .
the speech selection filter is applied only to the text if all conditions apply with an entry in the box Di@@ esen Filter when apply . you must enter at least one condition .
the voice output API , von &amp; k@@ de ; , with which program@@ mers can give their applications T@@ TS skills . applications communicate with K@@ TT@@ SD via &amp; d@@ bus ; .
the K@@ TT@@ SD module API , can be added to K@@ TT@@ SD with the voice syn@@ thesizer , so you can use this syn@@ thesizer .
the following section contains a short description of the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ D@@ Bus ; -@@ interface of the language output API of &amp; k@@ de ; the full documentation for both APIs will be found on the k@@ de ; Acces@@ sibility website ( ht@@ t@@ p : / / acces@@ si@@ bil@@ ity@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org ) .
applications require voice output services via the &amp; d@@ bus ; interface from &amp; k@@ de ; from the kt@@ ts@@ d program to the object K@@ Spe@@ ech .
text of text to read and option is a language code such as &amp; eg ; en , de &amp; etc ;
there are even more commands you can use . for a list of all commands type
open two &amp; Con@@ sole ; -@@ windows . only start kt@@ ts@@ d in one window , then kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr in the other .
none of the mentioned language syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers supports my language . where can I get a syn@@ thesizer for my language ?
I have set up the &amp; HTML ; -@@ XML ; -@@ For@@ ward filter , but when using the module for festival web pages are not read .
due to an error in Festival 1.@@ 95 beta you have to install the ( male UK ) voice ra@@ b _ di@@ phone to make S@@ able work at all . you must do this even if you do not use this voice to read web pages . also make sure the program x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c is installed and can be found via the environment variable PAT@@ H .
certain characters or punc@@ tu@@ ation marks appear to cause mistakes in syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers so that whole sets are ski@@ pped or only Kau@@ der@@ wel@@ sh is spent . what can I do about it ?
first make sure that the encoding option is set to the correct value for the corresponding language . if there are problems with certain characters or words , these may be corrected by a string replacement filter . see .

the voice syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers used by &amp; kt@@ ts have their own license which you can find in the related documentation or on the respective websites . there are also voices that have their own license .
if you have access to the K@@ DE source code archive , you can download the package c@@ de@@ able with &amp; kt@@ ts ; you can find it in the kt@@ ts@@ d folder . you can also find the source code of c@@ de@@ able under ft@@ p : / / ft@@ p.@@ k@@ de@@ .org / pub / k@@ de / .

K@@ T@@ TS works with any voice syn@@ thesizer , which can be started on the command line in a console .
the list of languages mentioned above may be incomplete or out@@ dated . therefore , consult the description of the syn@@ thesizer to the supported languages . see also on the website of kt@@ ts ; , for information that are not yet contained in this manual .
the &quot; speech @-@ disp@@ at@@ cher &quot; program uses an adap@@ table module architecture for voice syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers . if you want to extend the use of a different syn@@ thesizer , contact the developer team .
the x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c program is used for the support of SS@@ ML and for the &amp; XML ; -@@ conversion filter , but is not mandatory . Deb@@ ian users can install x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c using the apt @-@ get install x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c command .
to compile and t@@ act , you need a current development environment of K@@ DE ( version 3.4 or later ) including packages of k@@ deli@@ bs and development files for the &quot; speech @-@ disp@@ at@@ cher &quot; program .
if you refer to the source code of &amp; kt@@ ts ; refer to c@@ de@@ able from the source code archive or download the tar@@ ball created every night , compile and install the program with the following commands :
before you start &amp; t@@ act , first check if speech disp@@ at@@ cher works correctly with your voice syn@@ thesizer . to do this , you can use the shell script sp@@ d @-@ conf .
&amp; kt@@ ts ; in &amp; k@@ de ; 4.4 is the first version of &amp; kt@@ ts ; the program kt@@ t@@ ms@@ gr should be developed in such a way that the establishment of speech pat@@ chers is directly possible and the script sp@@ d @-@ conf is no longer needed .
a long text is de@@ composed into individual sentences . the user can go back to pro@@ posi@@ tional or paragraph mode , repeat , pause or cancel the output .
if an application passes text to &amp; kt@@ ts , it can specify the characteristics of the preferred speaker for output . if you have set up a speaker whose language is English and its gender female , it will be used , otherwise the best suitable speaker will be chosen .
when you click Add Sub@@ scribe to Add a spokes@@ man to the list , or click Edit , the card board speaker setup will be shown . as an example , the setup of the module for Festival Interactive is shown below . for details on the modules , please refer to .
enter the path to the exec@@ utable festival program . if the path to the festival is included in PAT@@ H , just enter the festival .
select the character encoding for text that is passed to festival . in voices , the &amp; kt@@ ats ; known , this setting is automatically made . generally , Western languages use ISO 88@@ 59 @-@ 1 , Eastern languages such as Czech or Slovak use ISO 88@@ 59 @-@ 2 .
with these sli@@ ders you can adjust volume , speech velocity and pitch of the synthetic language . if you cannot select some controls and appear in grey , the voice you choose does not allow these settings to be displayed .
some voices like Multi@@ Sy@@ n voices need to be loaded several seconds due to their size . if you mark this check box , these voices are already loaded at the start of K@@ TT@@ SD so that the first movement is syn@@ thes@@ ized faster ( with greater memory consumption ) .
if this check box cannot be selected , you have not yet created a speaker ( or click Apply to click on the user ) .
if this check box is selected , the kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr program window is displayed at the start of kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr . otherwise , only the kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr icon is visible in the system section after the start , but not the program window . click the icon in the system section to see the program window .
if this check box is selected and kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr is not running , it will appear in the system area as soon as K@@ TT@@ SD reads a text .
here all orders are listed in queue , along with the application that has set the order , the current status of the order , the number of sentences and the currently edited set . the speaker ID corresponds to the ID of the ID on the card card speaker .
with the buttons in this series , you can move forward or backward in the order selected in the list below . ( but not every order consists of several sets ) .
with a click on OK , all changes in the settings ( also on the other flash@@ cards ) are taken over and kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr is reduced to the symbol in the system section . then click on this icon to display the program window again .
if the sound system &amp; arts ; not installed but instead AL@@ SA , G@@ Stre@@ amer or a@@ Ko@@ de , click on the audio card audio . see also .
only text orders are listed and managed here . outputs of screen readers , warnings and messages are not displayed . read more about the news types of &amp; kt@@ ts ; find in .
select the type of audio output here . if a component cannot be selected , it was compiled &amp; kt@@ ts ; either without support for the appropriate audio module compiled or &amp; t@@ ts ; can not load the necessary libraries .
if G@@ Stre@@ amer or a@@ Ko@@ de is to be used for audio output , select the audio output here . if no output modules are displayed in the list , you must install at least one module . if you have selected AL@@ SA , select the PC@@ M device here .
set the subscri@@ ber speed here . 50@@ free ; % equals about half and 200@@ nbsp ; % about twice the normal chat speed . to allow these settings to be implemented , the program must be so@@ x installed .
click Apply to take over the new settings for the current &amp; Desktop ; system .
the list of AL@@ SA devices includes all PC@@ M devices and modules installed in your system . most of them will not work . you will need to find out which device works with you . in doubt choose standard .
on this map menu you can set up special actions that will always be executed when the text order is interrupted by a message with higher priority . &amp; kt@@ ts ; processes four types of voice orders :
the output of screen readers has the highest priority . it is preferred to all other orders and keeps these orders . after the output of the screen reader has been read , the sustained orders are resum@@ ed .
warnings have the highest priority . this level is important news such as &amp; eg ; processor is reserved too hot . a warning keeps the output of messages and normal text . these orders are resum@@ ed after reading the warning .
messages have the next priority . a message interrup@@ ts normal text . &amp; k@@ mouth ; is an example of an application that pron@@ oun@@ ces messages . if you &amp; eg ; just read a long text on a website , you can still welcome someone who just enters the room .
a text order is interrupted by a message , warning or output of a screen reader , adds &amp; t@@ ts ; the audio output in the queue .
this audio file is always played when a normal text order is interrupted . if both the introduc@@ tory sound and the introduc@@ tory message are active , the introduc@@ tory sound will be played in front of the introduc@@ tory message .
the settings on this card are only valid for normal text orders . there are no special actions for messages , warnings , and the output of screen readers if they are interrupted by a message with higher priority .
to read with &amp; kt@@ ats , read the Noti@@ fy messages , launch t@@ m@@ gr and click Noti@@ fications . the card card notification appears .
check this check box to enable the reading of &amp; k@@ de ; noti@@ fications . if this setting is not selected , the other settings are disabled and &amp; kt@@ ts ; do not read al@@ erts .
when this setting is selected , noti@@ fications in which a sound is played , are read by &amp; kt@@ ts ; not read .
use these buttons to add events to the list or delete it . when you click on the Add button , a dialog appears where you can select the application and event you want to add to the list .
this event reads the message , the &amp; Con@@ vers@@ ation ; sends out if someone men@@ tions your nick@@ name in an I@@ RC message .
all events for which nothing else is specified in the list are ignored by &amp; kt@@ ts ; ignored .
use this sel@@ ector to specify what &amp; t@@ ts ; do when an event occurs . you have the following choices :
if you have selected user @-@ defined text , enter the desired text . you can use the following plac@@ eholders :
you can enter here the characteristics of the desired speaker . standard sel@@ ects the speaker that is shown as the top entry in the list on the card card speaker . see also .
note that there are three levels for events . if an action is specified for a specific event of a particular application , it will be executed . otherwise , the action will be executed for all other events of the particular application . as the last option , the action will be applied which was specified under standard ( all other events ) .
the event All noti@@ fications for the Application Standard ( all other events cannot be deleted from the list . for this purpose , you can set the noti@@ fications to be read as follows :
use the Save button to save the settings for the al@@ erts to a file . use the Load button to load saved settings from a file . the loaded events will be merged with the events listed in the list . if you want to start an empty list , click Del@@ ete . all entries except all noti@@ fications will be deleted .
the Spe@@ ech Syn@@ thesis Mark@@ up Language ( SS@@ ML ) is a W3@@ C standard to select text for voice output . this standard includes marks for controlling voices , speaking speed , volume , sex of voice and pitch .
currently supported &amp; kt@@ ts ; SS@@ ML only partially and only in the basic functions . the following restrictions are available :
you must install the ra@@ b _ di@@ phone voice ( British male ) , as this is the standard voice , the festival uses the output of SS@@ ML .
if the settings for speed or pitch in the festival configuration dialog are not set to 100@@ m@@ t. ; % , SS@@ ML text is usually spoken very mon@@ oton@@ ously .
&lt; ! &#91; C@@ DATA &#91; &lt; ?

there are two types of filters - normal filters and punc@@ tu@@ ation detection filters ( SD@@ B filters ) . S@@ B@@ Ds sub@@ divide the text into single sentences . this can be done faster with the pre@@ read , since only the first proposition must be syn@@ thes@@ ized , not the entire text order . thus , you can also jump or stop writing assignments on the card card , even if the voice syn@@ thesizer does not directly support this .
here you can see the punc@@ tu@@ ation detection filter . at the first start of &amp; kt@@ ts , a set limit detection filter is set up automatically . you can change its settings or add further set @-@ level detection filters , but beginners will not be dis@@ cour@@ aged .
the easiest way to learn is to set up the speaker selection by selecting . turn off the speaker selection and select text to read . check the speaker selection , change some features and check how the selection of the speaker changes . to do so you have to have more than one speaker installed , otherwise the filter is in@@ effective .
&amp; kt@@ ts ; then start reading faster , since only the first set has to be processed and not the whole text block , which can take a long time ,
you can then pause or cancel jobs on the card card , even if the voice syn@@ thesizer does not support this function .
for these reasons , the standard set @-@ level detection filter is automatically set up when you start kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr for the first time . it cannot be turned off , only removed . do not change anything on this filter unless you know what you are doing .
set limits identification filters compare text with a regular expression for set @-@ ends and add a tab character ( Dec@@ im@@ al code 8 ) to the set limits ( tab characters are automatically removed from the text before filtering ) . note that the default punc@@ tu@@ ation filter maintains the punc@@ tu@@ ation .

you can over@@ ride the speaker settings for the application on the map menu . the card card is displayed when
use of the standard speaker ( the top one on the card card speaker ) . in other words : there won &apos;t be any speech features .
use the most suitable speaker , which displays all the features of a set @-@ up speaker . if you do not delete or edit the speaker &apos;s settings , select &amp; kt@@ ts ; this speaker . otherwise select &amp; kt@@ ts ; the speaker that most likely corresponds to the originally set features .
select the method to enter the desired speaker properties by clicking on one of the selection buttons .
select the characteristics of the desired speaker here . if this feature does not matter , enter nothing .
select this check box if the property should have preced@@ ence over other properties . you can also set several flags here .
since the language is a critical factor when understanding the output , it is always treated as the priority property . you will rarely use this property . the only case where you may want to specify the attribute language is , if you know that a certain application text is sent in a different language than the one in the working environment .
to use all the features in the Spe@@ aker section , which is most likely to delete the following , click the default spokes@@ man button and then use the speaker that is the closest to the following .
in this case 0 stands for the last text order in the queue . you can also specify an order number . ( without order number the input 0 is required ) .

before you start &amp; t@@ ts , first check if your voice syn@@ thesizer works properly . follow the instructions you have received with the syn@@ thesizer .
Festival is one of the best free T@@ TS syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers whose source code is open . the quality of the voices is generally good , and multiple voices and languages are supported .
you need to install at least one language . help is found in the instructions supplied with the festival . if you want to read websites , you need to install the ( male UK ) voice ra@@ b _ di@@ phone .
for these voices you need to compile an additional module , so you need the source code of the festival . the German voices are subject to restrictions on sharing .
this voice pres@@ upp@@ oses Festival 1.@@ 95 beta or newer . the voice is still at an early stage of development . if you set up the Russian voices , you need to enter the voices MS@@ U _ ru _ NS@@ H _ di@@ phone . select a Cy@@ ri@@ l@@ lic ( 8 @-@ bit ) encoding as for example ko@@ i@@ 8 @-@ R .
Festival is usually included in the &amp; Linux distri@@ butions . therefore , find the festival first on the CDs of your distribution .
if you want to use the Polish , Hungarian or Czech languages , the encoding option has to be set to ISO 88@@ 59 @-@ 2 .
if you want to use the Russian voice , the encoding option must be set to an 8 bit cy@@ ri@@ l@@ lic such as ko@@ i@@ 8 @-@ R .
Festival can be used together with the MB@@ RO@@ LA , syn@@ thesizer . then Festival takes over the le@@ x@@ ical analysis and &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; generates the audio output from it . the &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; program and the &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; voices can be downloaded from
note that &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; no complete voice output system is . &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; generates language from Di@@ phon files . you need additional software to create these Di@@ Ph@@ ones . Festival generates these from &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; needed di@@ phon@@ e. t@@ x@@ t@@ 2@@ ph@@ o can also generate from German texts Di@@ phone . more information can be found under .
in this process , additional wra@@ pper code is added to the festival to use &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; voice synthesis voices . note that the &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; voice files are not installed in &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; folders , but in the folder festival / li@@ b / .

this manual explains the installation and use of &amp; c@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; , a module for the &amp; c@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; that allows management of network interfaces , routing and DNS settings .
the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; allows the user to manage a number of system and desktop settings via a uniform , integrated interface . the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; can be called by selecting K Menu k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ;
the &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; package is designed to allow users to manage TCP / IP network settings in the same way as other settings from the &amp; c@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; create a simple interface for the user :
after installation , a new module network settings will be displayed in the &amp; c@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; the module Network Settings ( k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ) can be started by selecting k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; Internet &amp; Network Network Settings in &amp; K@@ Menu .
it is important to understand that &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; network hardware cannot install . physical devices and their drivers need to be fully installed and configured to allow &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; the device at all shows and allows the setting of the network properties .
in most cases , drivers for network hardware and other devices are installed and installed while installing &amp; Linux . if network devices are added later , the drivers need to be loaded by adjusting the following files according to the kernel version :
the Network Settings module is loaded when the Network Settings option is selected in &amp; c@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; -@@ Index . when starting module network settings , this will automatically detect the used platform on the system .
if the platform cannot be detected , the manual selection is offered . it is the platform from the list that best matches the distribution and release status . selecting non @-@ re @-@ en@@ quiries can be made permanently .
changing network settings is only possible in system management mode . previously , all options are displayed in grey , meaning the settings can only be viewed , changing is not possible . in system management mode , click the button System Administration Mode at the lower end of the module . it is required to enter the password .
in the system management mode , the entire functionality of the module is available . it is divided into three tabs :
the Ri@@ der Network interfaces are used to manage the network devices of the system . all available network devices are displayed . the following tasks can be performed by the Reiter Network interfaces :
the settings displayed by displayed network interfaces can be set up by selecting the desired device in the list and clicking the button interface ... in the Device Dialog box .
by default , only basic TCP / IP settings are available . click the Advanced Settings button to display the dialog with further options .
with the Automati@@ cally selection , the TCP / IP settings are fet@@ ched from a DH@@ CP server or BO@@ O@@ TP server . in automatic mode , TCP / IP settings for the system are carried out simultaneously with the start of the system services . the DH@@ CP@@ - or BO@@ O@@ TP server sends all necessary TCP / IP information for each system start , therefore no further setting is required . in the selection list , either DH@@ CP or BO@@ O@@ TP server can be selected according to the system .
the manual can be configured with the TCP / IP configuration without DH@@ CP or BO@@ O@@ TP . in the input field IP address the desired TCP / IP address must be specified .
if this setting is selected , the system initi@@ alizes the network interface when bo@@ oting . if the initi@@ alization is not desired , this option should not be activated .
the values entered in this dialog are displayed as properties of the device in the device list .
it should be ensured that the IP address in the network is not already used . entering an existing IP address would lead to a TCP / IP conflict . ping in the &amp; console ; you can determine if the desired address is already in use . in doubt , the network administrator should be asked .
network devices can be turned on or off according to requirements . switching on an out@@ dated network device can be activated by selecting from the list and clicking on interface ....
network devices can be turned on or off according to requirements . dis@@ ab@@ ling an activated network device can be disabled by selecting from the list and clicking on interface ....
specifies the IP address of the host on the local sub@@ net , which medi@@ ates the physical connection to remote networks and is used as standard for TCP / IP communication with hosts in other sub@@ nets .
if there is more than one network interface on the computer , the interface must be selected to the network in which the gateway computer is located .
a host with DNS support replaces a complete domain name by the corresponding IP address . this is necessary because computers only understand IP addresses . if the host requests ht@@ t@@ p : / / www.@@ ein@@ ed@@ om@@ ain@@ .org , DNS will resolve this name to an IP address such as 12@@ 3.@@ 4@@ 5.@@ 67@@ 8.@@ 90 .
the name resolution part of the name resolution calcul@@ ator allows easy management of this list . entries can be added , removed or altered . DNS records can be group@@ ed in priority by selecting an entry and / or gra@@ ding in the list with the buttons adding or down@@ gra@@ ding .
by clicking the button Add ... from the group host to the name resolution , a DNS server can be added . it will be added to the New Name Server dialog .
first , enter the IP address of the DNS server and then click the Add button . the entry is then inserted in the list .
from the group calcul@@ ator to name resolution , select an entry and then click the Edit button .... Edit dialog will display .
the list name calcul@@ ator specifies host@@ name @-@ to @-@ IP address links for the TCP / IP sub@@ system . it is primarily used when bo@@ oting when no DNS servers are available . in small , closed networks , it can replace DNS servers .
the list usually contains some entries , which support &amp; ap@@ os ; loc@@ al@@ host@@ ap@@ os ; and some special IP@@ v@@ 6 addresses . this still in the test version of IP will replace in future version 4 .
enter the IP address of the known computer and click Add ... Add the New Ali@@ as dialog .
enter the name of the familiar computer and click the Add button . if the well @-@ known host has multiple alias names , press the Add button multiple times and enter the other alias names .
select an entry of a name @-@ known computer from the list and select Edit .... The dialog Con@@ ver@@ ted Calcul@@ ator will be displayed .
it can be executed one of the following tasks , then clicking OK will update the list of static hosts .
the settings made in the module network settings are not immediately effective in the system . to activate the changes must be set in a &amp; Con@@ sole ; the following command must be set .
the homepage of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; is ht@@ t@@ p : / / k@@ net@@ work@@ conf@@ .@@ sourc@@ e@@ for@@ ge@@ .net , from which you can download the latest version of the source code .
for the installation of binary distri@@ butions ( mostly rpm packages ) it is sufficient if &amp; k@@ de ; and Q@@ t are installed .
the installation of the compiled version is recommended for less experienced users . it is easy to download the rpm package and install in a &amp; console ; with rpm as follows :
alternatively , a tool can be used with graphical interface like k@@ package or the installation tool of their distribution .
for this case , the installation of Q@@ t and &amp; k@@ de does not suff@@ ice , but additionally the development packages are needed with libraries and other things .
this is recommended only to experienced users . however , it is not difficult to compile and compile the following commands .
in the first section of this chapter , important information about basic network technology is given , in the second section all of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; change configuration files will be discussed .
this section cannot replace further knowledge about IP networks . in this app@@ endi@@ x only basic information about the integration of the PC into a small ( home ) network is medi@@ ated .
IP networks are currently being operated with TCP / IP version 4 ( IP@@ v@@ 4 ) . IP@@ v@@ 5 has never found any major dis@@ semination . IP@@ v@@ 6 is expected to be implemented in the near future .
one of the most important information is to know which IP address of a network interface is to be assigned . in foreign networks , at &amp; eg ; workplace , the network administrator is the contact person that as@@ signs a valid IP address or , if available , DH@@ CP can be used .
when setting up your own small ( home ) network , the IP address should be selected from a reserved area specifically reserved for this purpose in order to avoid IP address conflicts with the global ( Internet ) network . the addresses from the table below are not forwarded on the Internet , so any use is possible .
of course , access to the Internet can be enabled for such machines by setting a g@@ ate@@ ways .
for smaller networks , addresses in the range from 19@@ 2.@@ 16@@ 8.@@ 1.1 to 19@@ 2.@@ 16@@ 8.@@ 1.@@ 25@@ 4 are used . the range is large enough for networks up to 250 computers .
in addition , the net@@ mask is usually set to 25@@ 5.@@ 25@@ 5.@@ 25@@ 5.0 , so that all hosts are participants in the same sub@@ net .
some addresses are reserved for special things , 0.0@@ eg ; .@@ 0.0 and 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 . the first is the so @-@ called standard route , the second is the lo@@ op@@ back address ( loc@@ al@@ host = your own computer ) . the default route is required for the IP forwarding .
the network address 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 is reserved for IP traffic in the local machine . normally , the address 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 has its own lo@@ op@@ back interface , which works like a closed circle .
in this part you will find the configuration files that are affected by &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf and where they are stored in the various distri@@ butions .
this file is sometimes dynamically changed in DSL connections , so it will not be surprised if other content than specified there is found in the case of active DSL connections .
for &amp; Su@@ SE ; it is known that this file is sorted by the scripts in Su@@ S@@ Econ@@ fig . a different status than expected may therefore occur .

&amp; k@@ dat ; is a backup program for tape drives based on tar . it offers the possibility to store several archives on a tape . the first was to create a surface for tar , which additionally offered the capability of dd@@ s@@ 2@@ tar for fast , selective un@@ packing . the second aim was to answer a question that my wife did : how much longer does it take when you secure ?
before a tape can be used it must be included in &amp; k@@ dat ; this can be done in three ways :
&amp; k@@ dat ; get the tape back and read the pre @-@ tension@@ ing information of the tape . recognize &amp; k@@ dat ; don &apos;t know the credits on the tape , you &apos;ll be asked if the tape should be format@@ ted .
detects &amp; k@@ dat ; the leader , searches for the appropriate index on your disk . if this cannot be found , you will be asked if the band index should be recre@@ ated .
if everything went smoothly , the symbol for the tape drive changes to indicate that the tape has been integrated . in the status bar a corresponding message appears . the contents of the tape can now be scanned by un@@ folding the entry for the tape .
before throwing the tape , the integration must first be solved . there are three methods to do this :
&amp; k@@ dat ; indicates by a change in the symbol for the tape that the integration for the tape has been solved and shows a corresponding message in the Status Bar . the tape can now be ej@@ ected without any danger .
before a tape can be used by &amp; k@@ dat , it must be format@@ ted by &amp; k@@ dat .
a band @-@ type must be format@@ ted before you can use it to store data . this process does not correspond to the format@@ ting at &amp; k@@ dat ; . if your tape drive needs to be format@@ ted before use , this must happen before you can be format@@ ted by the tape of &amp; k@@ dat ; floppy drives usually require format@@ ting of tape , DA@@ T drives do not .
after entering the band name and capacity goes &amp; k@@ dat ; with the tape format@@ ting . all data on the tape is lost ! after completion of the format@@ ting process , the tape is automatically mounted and is ready to use .
before you start the backup process , you must select the files to be secured . this can be done in three ways :
select a file or folder in the local file tree . only this file or folder is backed up .
select a backup profile in the tree . only the files specified in the profile will be backed up .
select files in the local file tree with a tick . only the selected files and / or sub@@ folders are backed up .
ri@@ ght@@ click the local file tree and select in the Save menu ...
once the backup is started , the Settings dialog opens . in this dialog , you can once again check the selected files and change the settings for backup .
the dialog displays the progress of the backup process , including the data rate and the remaining time .
select a file or folder in one of the archives in the entry for the drive . only the selected file or folder will be checked .
select the files in one of the archives in the entry for the tape with a tick . only the selected files and / or sub@@ folders are checked .
right @-@ click in one of the archives and select the menu entry Check .
once the test procedure has been started , the dialog box for verification will appear . in this dialog you can check your selection again and change the working folder for checking .
if you have confirmed the settings for the verification , the dialog will review . this dialog displays the progress of the audit process as well as the data throughput and the time remaining .
before you can initiate the restore , the files to be recovered must be selected . this can be done in two ways :
select a file or folder in one of the archives that belong to the tape drive . only the selected file or sub@@ folder will be recovered .
select the files you want from one of the archives with a tick . only the selected files and / or sub@@ folders will be recovered .
right @-@ click on a file or folder in one of the archives and select Rest@@ ore ...
once the recovery process has been started , the dialog box for recovery appears . in this dialog you can check your selection again and change the working folder for recovery .
if you have confirmed the settings for recovery , the dialog will appear again . this dialog displays the progress of the recovery process as well as the data throughput and the time remaining .
sometimes it is necessary to recre@@ ate the band index file using the tape content . this process del@@ etes all existing index files for this volume . you can create the index on two types of tape :
this creates a backup profile with the currently selected files and the default settings . you can set the following settings for a backup profile :
the current working folder where the backup should take place . the list of files to be secured is automatically updated according to the selected working folder .
for all folders listed under backup files , only the files in it are backed up on the same file system as the folder . folders located on other file systems can be placed separately under backup files . each entry is considered by tar regardless of the other file system .
incre@@ mental backup . to determine which files have changed since the last incre@@ mental backup , a snapshot file is used . only the files that have changed since then are backed up .
the name of the file used to determine the changes since the last incre@@ mental backup .
delete the snapshot file before calling tar . this causes all files to be backed up and a new snapshot file is created for the next backup .
the functionality of the buttons files &amp; gt ; lt ; files were not fully implemented at the time of creating this documentation .
the settings can be set using the menu item K@@ D@@ at ... in the Settings menu . you can make the following settings :
the complete path to the device file for the tape drive ( usually / dev / tape ) . this path must point to the non @-@ re@@ winding version of the tape recorder .
this setting is active , transmitted &amp; k@@ dat ; before the tape is mounted , the command mt load to the drive . for some drives this is necessary before reading or writing operations can be performed .
if the option is turned on , try &amp; k@@ dat ; block the ej@@ ector at the tape drive . possibly this setting does not work on all tape drives .
if the option is enabled , it will automatically e@@ ject the tape when un@@ plug@@ ging &amp; k@@ dat . do not use this option on floppy amm@@ ers .
if the option is turned on , try &amp; k@@ dat , change the hard@@ war@@ ted block size for the tape drive . not all drives support variable block sizes . no matter whether this setting is active or not , you have to tell the block size for your tape drive .
if &amp; k@@ dat ; a tape format@@ ted , it writes a file to the beginning of the tape . this file should occupy only one block of memory on the tape . the contents of the file are composed as follows :
( n Byte ) The band ID . the format of this string is the host@@ name : seconds , where host@@ name is the complete name of the system on which the tape has been format@@ ted . seconds is the number of seconds that have passed since the era in which the band has been format@@ ted .
the band ID is used to find a file with the same name in the file $ HO@@ ME / .@@ k@@ dat / .
the rest of the files on the tape are pure tar archives , which can be managed directly with &amp; GNU ; - tar . even other tar versions should work as long as they are not incre@@ mental back@@ ups .
check the content of a backup tape . this icon is only active when a tape is included .
&amp; k@@ system@@ log ; is a &amp; node ; Viewer for system logs . the program is suitable for inexperienced users who do not know where to receive information about your system or where the system supports the different protocol files . moreover , &amp; k@@ esystem log ; experienced users can quickly access information about problems that occur on their server .
&amp; k@@ system@@ log ; helps users understand what makes your computer in the background . the task of &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; is a simplified representation of the protocol files of your system . the program is suitable for inexperienced users who do not know where to get information about your system or where the system re@@ stores different protocol files .
moreover , &amp; k@@ system@@ log enables experienced users to quickly access information about problems that occur on their server . &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; therefore , try to provide some advanced functions to filter and evaluate the protocol files of certain programs .
in current version 0.@@ 4.1 has &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; a number of useful functions . these include :
support for many different types of log files , for the format of the sy@@ slo@@ g server and for Sam@@ ba
many other functions are also included and are explained in the further chapters of this manual .
as you see in the screen@@ shots below , you can easily filter and sort the individual protocol lines of a protocol file . the individual options for sorting and filtering are shown in the next chapter of this manual .
after the start &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; initially , the most important log file of the system - the system protocol - will open . if you do not display it , and it opens instead of it a small message window , so you have &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; most likely not with system administrator privileges .
you can also use the filter bar to filter by a selected criterion or entered strings . the list of log lines is now automatically changed , so that only log lines are displayed that fit to the selected filter . in the default setting , a protocol line is displayed only if the string of the filter string is included in one of the columns .
you can of course select another entry at this point . the string of the filter search term is then matched only with entries in the corresponding column . for example , in the protocol file system protocol , select the column process , and also enter the name of a process in the protocol file , thus showing you &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; all protocol lines that were sent or created by this process .
this option is enabled in the default setting and helps you to detect the important protocol lines . protocol lines of level errors are displayed with a con@@ spic@@ uous color as protocol lines of level indication .
if you wish to show only certain processes ( for example in the system protocol or in the C@@ ron protocol ) , you can hide the process identification ( PID ) in the process column . this can be useful for example if you want to examine the output of a particular command such as the start of the sam@@ ba server . in this case , use filter bar .
in addition , you can activate the Add to new lines in the main window context menu to display all the new log lines .
&amp; k@@ system@@ log ; allows you to view multiple log files in separate sub @-@ windows . to use this feature , use the entries in the menu to open and manage additional sub @-@ windows . once you have selected a sub@@ window , select a protocol to display in the menu .
&amp; k@@ system@@ log ; has its own website on ht@@ t@@ p : / / k@@ system@@ log@@ .@@ forum @-@ softwar@@ e.@@ org . you will find more current information on the Sour@@ ces of &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; .
&amp; k@@ system@@ log ; can also be found in the following folder of the &amp; node ; -@@ Subversion archive : k@@ esystem log ; in &amp; node ; -@@ archive
welcome to &amp; k@@ de ; System V In@@ it Editor , rather known ( and so named ) as &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; this section introduces some concepts and describes what you can do with &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v .
system V In@@ it is quickly becoming the standard for the control of program start @-@ up when bo@@ oting the system in the &amp; Linux world . this is because it is easier to use , more powerful and at the same time more flexible than the traditional BSD @-@ In@@ it .
I will not go further into historical aspects ( e.g. because I don &apos;t know about it myself : - ) .
the in@@ it binary is under / s@@ bin and not under / etc . this is important because maybe someone could try to switch a machine to System V in@@ it without re @-@ installing and re @-@ format@@ ting . that &apos;s why you need to make sure that the old in@@ it was removed from there if there was one .
the Sy@@ s@@ V In@@ it differs from the BSD In@@ it that the configuration files are in a sub@@ folder of / etc . this folder is called r@@ c.@@ d. D@@ ort you will find r@@ c.@@ sy@@ sin@@ it and the following folders :
in@@ it@@ .@@ d contains a whole lot of scripts . basically you need a script for every system service you want to start at startup of the system or when changing to another run level . system services include such things as network , NFS , &amp; Send@@ mail ; , ht@@ tp@@ d , etc ; system services do not include such things as set@@ serial , which is started only once . such calls belong to r@@ c.@@ local .
r@@ c.@@ local should be in / etc / r@@ c.@@ d if you need it . most systems have this file , even if there is not much use for it . you can also create a r@@ c.@@ serial in / etc / r@@ c.@@ d if you want to run a r@@ c.@@ serial port if you want to do something with the serial port .
the kernel sel@@ ects in@@ it at various points after the program and starts the first one you find .
the default runtime is entered in / etc / in@@ it@@ tab . you should see a line like the following :
at this point , you can take a look at the second column and probably notice that the default Run@@ Level 3 is . if you want to change that , then you can edit / etc / in@@ it@@ tab by hand and change the 3 . if you have confused something , then you will repair it by re@@ boot the system and execute the following :
but how does it start all the right scripts ? if you type ls -@@ l in r@@ c@@ 3.@@ d , then you &apos;ll probably see something like the following :
you will notice that there are no real files in this folder . instead , each entry is a link to one of the scripts in the in@@ it@@ .@@ d directory .
how to start and stop in@@ it actually system services ? quite simple : each of the scripts is written in such a way that it accepts an argument as start and stop . you can actually start these scripts from hand on the command line as follows :
this would stop the ht@@ tp@@ d server . in@@ it reads the name , and if the one contains a K , the script is called with the argument stop . if it contains an S , the script is called with the argument start .
some people want a simple way to set up machines for many purposes . I could have &amp; eg ; a server running level that only runs ht@@ tp@@ d , &amp; sen@@ d@@ mail ; , network , etc ; in addition , I could also have a user run@@ level , that &amp; eg ; &amp; k@@ d@@ m ; , network &amp; etc ; runs .
here you learn the use of &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; it should not be very difficult , because the program was designed as user @-@ friendly as possible .
the use of &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; with a mouse or another poin@@ ter is simple to not say tri@@ vial : simply drag an entry from the range of available system services to one of the six run@@ levels to start it on this level ( or stop ) .
you can also move the scripts between Run@@ level@@ ed or move the position within a level by pulling it somewhere else . in doing so , the entry is removed from its original running level ( or its position ) . this will only happen if you extract an entry from the range of available system services .
note : entries are moved when you drag them to a new area . to simply copy them to a new run level , you must explicitly select Copy from the Edit menu or from the contex@@ tual menu and insert it into the target area -- even if the same entry has previously been in the target area of the action .
the sort number of an entry can sometimes not be comp@@ uted . in such a case , you need to edit the sorting numbers of the surrounding entries before attempting to insert the system service again .
note : currently there is no way to recover entries that have been thrown into the Recy@@ cle Bin . so be careful .
you can use the Tab@@ ul@@ ator key to activate the different work areas ( Available System Services , Run@@ level 1 Start , Run@@ time 1 Stop &amp; etc ; ) as well as the cursor keys to make a selection above or below the previous one .
to move an entry into another running level , move it with cutting into the clip@@ board ( you can also use C@@ trl ; X ) and insert it into the desired running level with insert ( with C@@ trl ; V ) .
to change the sorting number or the name of an entry manually , press the Enter key to open the Properties dialog . use the Tab key to switch between different fields . close the dialog by pressing the input button to accept the changes , or press Es@@ c to disc@@ ard the changes .
because of the risk of data loss , all entries in the File menu require a confirmation before they are executed .
all settings are stored in $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / config / k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c . def@@ aults are removed from the global file ( $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / config / k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c ) , if available . otherwise , they will be restored by &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; settings are stored in a local k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c .
I experim@@ ented with the standard run@@ levels , and now the machine is getting started anew . what can I do ?
enter the LI@@ LO prompt lin@@ ux single and press the input button to start in single use mode . then edit the file / etc / in@@ it@@ tab and change the default runtime to a reasonable value ( 3 should normally be fine ) .
I have some system services with &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; running under Run@@ level X , but they are not executed .
if you use &amp; Su@@ SE ; or Deli@@ x ( DL@@ D ) , you need to edit additional files in / etc that are only present in these distri@@ butions . please read the details in the Distribution Guide .
the way system services are launched in these distri@@ butions simplifies the configuration for the proprietary setup programs of these distri@@ butions , but unfortunately does not meet any standard . the authors of &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; plan an extension of the program for this approach .
if you are using another distribution , please check that all configuration files are provided by the respective system service ( and also whether they are in the correct directory ) . some services ( such as &amp; eg ; Apache and ht@@ tp@@ d ) simply end without notice if their configuration files are not present or in@@ correctly configured .
the meaning of the &amp; Linux ; runtime varies from distribution to distribution , can even be different from version to version . if you are using another distribution , please send me information on the running level so that it can be added to this manual .
this documentation refers to &amp; k@@ user ; 1.0 . with this program you can manage the users and groups of your system .
to start with &amp; k@@ user ; it is sufficient to read the chapter custom@@ ization by &amp; k@@ user ;
after you have made changes , you must save them . either use the appropriate icon of the toolbar or the Save in the File menu .
the main window consists of two flash@@ cards , the user and the user group list . to edit , select the desired user or the desired group by double @-@ clicking on the entry .
some flash@@ cards are only displayed if you have advanced system settings . only when you have enabled space constraints ( quot@@ a ) for users will create a card card on which you can make individual settings . other flash@@ cards appear if shadow passwords or for example / etc / master@@ .@@ pass@@ w@@ d are installed like in BSD Unix .
the password management card card appears if shadow passwords or for example / etc / master@@ .@@ pass@@ w@@ d are installed like in BSD Unix .
this card card only appears if for at least one integrated fil@@ esystem space restriction ( quot@@ a ) is enabled and initi@@ alized ( recognizable by the quot@@ a user / quot@@ a group file on the file system ) .
these parameters can be set individually for each fil@@ esystem . the current fil@@ esystem is selected using the File System with space limitation
the Cart@@ ridge Groups inform groups about the group belonging to the selected user . the default group , to which the user belongs , can be found in the Prim@@ ur Group field . furthermore , the user can become a member in other groups by selecting them in the large field .
the Group &apos;s dialog features a list of all users . to add a user to the group , select this user in the list .
to add a user or group , select Add from the User or Group menu or click the appropriate Add button on the toolbar . editing or del@@ eting the selected user respectively the selected group works an@@ alog@@ ous .
with this module , you can install the LI@@ LO boot manager , add , remove and change boot password , change the time to boot the default operating system , add , remove , change operating systems , remove , change , and more .
