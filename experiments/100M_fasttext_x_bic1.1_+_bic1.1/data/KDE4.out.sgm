<seg id="1">Translate the module website in & konqueror; translate the menu under Extras website. select the source and target language of the translation from the drop-down list.</seg>
<seg id="2">If a part of the text is selected, only this part will be translated into place of the entire URL.</seg>
<seg id="3">Machine translations are only very rudimentary. babelfish produces in the best case a rough translation and in the worst case nonsense. therefore, the translations should not make any important decisions, without checking the translation before.</seg>
<seg id="4">Only web pages on the Internet can be translated. other texts should be translated by you on the Babelfish page, where you can add texts to translate.</seg>
<seg id="5">Package & package; includes various modules for & konqueror; despite their small size, they offer some additional functions and simplify the use of some features of & konqueror, by making them more readily available.</seg>
<seg id="6">More information about the use of & konqueror; and the built-in functions can be found in the manual on & konqueror;.</seg>
<seg id="7">To load these modules in & konqueror, select Options to set up extensions.... Open the card card utilities and select the desired modules there.</seg>
<seg id="8">This is a list of standard modules from the box kde; addons. please note that if you have additional software installed, you may need more modules on your system.</seg>
<seg id="9">You should install the kdebase package, which contains & konqueror; before you compile this package.</seg>
<seg id="10">To use the crash module, click in & konqueror; on Tools tab. then you can view the page, the & konqueror; to crash, or the list of crashes, if available, delete.</seg>
<seg id="11">The module Angle Filter (also called Folder Filter) can be found in the & konqueror; menu bar under Extras bar filter. with the module you can filter & konqueror; 's current working directory in different ways.</seg>
<seg id="12">To use the DOM tree view in & konqueror, select Extras DOM tree... and open a new window with the DOM of the currently displayed web page. as default, the display starts with the root node of the document, for example: documentItem, all other nodes are sub-elements of this root node.</seg>
<seg id="13">The module & FSView; for & konqueror; provides a further view for objects with the MIME-type inode / directory with local files. it can be used as an alternative for the various toolbars and text views to view the contents of your local file system.</seg>
<seg id="14">The special feature of & FSView is to display nested folder hierarchies with the help of a so-called tree map. tree maps allow the representation of the size of objects in nested structures. each object is represented by a rectangle whose area is proportional to its size. this size must possess the property that the sum of the sizes of the lower objects of an object is smaller or equal to the size of the object.</seg>
<seg id="15">At & FSView, the size of a file or folder reflects the size of a folder as the sum of the size of the entries in it. thus, large files can be easily identified even if they are far below in the folder hierarchy. accordingly, & FSView can be considered as a graphical and interactive version of the & UNIX; command.</seg>
<seg id="16">In & FSView, an entry in the Treemap representation is a rectangle that represents a file or folder in your filesystem. for easier navigation, the rectangles have useful color and labelling settings.</seg>
<seg id="17">The color of a rectangle that is switched over view color mode can be either depth for easy detection of the nesting depth or the image of another file property like name, owner, group or MIME type.</seg>
<seg id="18">A rectangle can be labeled with the different properties of the respective file or folder. for each feature, you can specify whether it is displayed at all, only if there is sufficient space for the representation or whether the area of subordinate rectangles is to be used (whereby, therefore, you can specify the relative position of the lettering in the rectangle.</seg>
<seg id="19">With representation algorithms for treemaps, the rule should be observed that the area is proportional to the size of the entry. in the Treemap in & FSView, this goal is not always maintained. frames are drawn to indicate the nesting of entries, and this framework will need space, which is then lost to the subordinate entries, if the rectangle is square.</seg>
<seg id="20">How to partition the area of an entry for the subordinate entries is left to the implementation. here, it is always advantageous for the labeling and avoidance of space losses through boxes so that rectangles are created that are as square as possible. the best methods in this respect are rows, columns or recursive division.</seg>
<seg id="21">You can set the minimal displayed area for an entry via the View Analogue button. instead, a diamond pattern is drawn into the area of the parent entry to indicate that this area is actually occupied by a subordinate entry.</seg>
<seg id="22">Originally, & FSView was designed as a small test application and introduction to the use of the TreeMap widget developed for the KCachegrind application.</seg>
<seg id="23">The Picture Gallery module can be found in the & Conqueror; menu under Extras picture gallery... or using Ctrl; I.</seg>
<seg id="24">When you visit the Picture Gallery module, a dialog opens that allows you to set the image of the gallery.</seg>
<seg id="25">The option Title of the page allows you to customize the title of the picture gallery page in a text entry field.</seg>
<seg id="26">The images per line option has a slider and a screenshot to adjust the number of thumbnails of each line in the gallery.</seg>
<seg id="27">With the check box file name of the image, specify whether the file names will be displayed in the gallery under the thumbnails.</seg>
<seg id="28">With the checkbox File Size of the image, specify whether the file size is displayed in the gallery under the thumbnails.</seg>
<seg id="29">With the image size check box, specify whether the size of the images will be displayed in the gallery in the gallery.</seg>
<seg id="30">In the Folder dialog, specify where the gallery is stored and which subfolders should be included.</seg>
<seg id="31">In the Save In HTML file, specify where to save the HTML page.</seg>
<seg id="32">You can set the sub-folder to the sub-folder using a slider or a screenshot to which level the subfolders will be included.</seg>
<seg id="33">Copy the original pictures with the check boxes to see if the original pictures are to be copied to the gallery.</seg>
<seg id="34">Using the comment box in the comment box, you can specify a comment file for the caption of the images in the gallery.</seg>
<seg id="35">In the check box Own color depth you can specify a different color depth for the thumbnails than in the original pictures.</seg>
<seg id="36">The module & HTML; -Settings provides easy access to general & HTML; -Settings for & Conqueror;.</seg>
<seg id="37">The module & HTML; -Settings can be found in the & Conqueror; menu under Tools HTML Settings. the following behavior of the web browser can be specified here:</seg>
<seg id="38">The media playback for the navigation pane can be found in the & konqueror; display menu under the Navigation Pane or with the keyboard shortcut F9.</seg>
<seg id="39">To play, click in the navigation pane of the & konqueror; and drag the music files you want to hear in the media playback.</seg>
<seg id="40">Change your browser identifier adds a menu entry in & konqueror, with which you can change the browser and operating system identifier for individual domains. this is useful for websites that only allow access with certain browsers.</seg>
<seg id="41">The default browser identification of the & konqueror; is Mozilla / 5.0 (compatible; Konqueror / 3.3; Linux) (KHTML, like Gecko). if you come to a website that refuses to access this browser, change your browser identifier into one of the following options.</seg>
<seg id="42">Changes the identifier in MSIE for pages that deny access with browsers on the base of Mozilla. for example, you need the MSIE browser recognition to call with the & konqueror; Hotmail.</seg>

<seg id="55">An easy-to-use camera interface will be provided for you to connect to your digital camera and download your photos directly in & digicam; albums. more than 1000 digital cameras are supported by the gphoto2 library. of course, every medium and card reader that is supported by your operating system will work together.</seg>
<seg id="56">You can use these to view, comment, evaluate and correct your photos. the editing capabilities can be easily expanded with KDE Image Plugins Interface (manual) modules.</seg>
<seg id="57">Although & digikam; easy to use, it provides dozens of professional capabilities. it works complete in 16-bit color space and all available modules support the raw conversion by libraw, DNG Export and ICC color management workflow.</seg>
<seg id="58">Improved database with significantly more metadata, such as & eg; via camera or lens, which can be searched.</seg>
<seg id="59">Like all; programs are also & digikam; an open source project. that means it depends on the support of the end users. therefore, you should report problems and improvement opportunities.</seg>
<seg id="60">If you are in the program, your web browser will open a page in the error report system. if you use these links, your web browser will open a page in the error report system. all the information you need is entered here. just follow the instructions to send your report.</seg>
<seg id="61">& digikam; is a project supported by a community. that is, the user and developer will help each other. if you are a regular user of & digikam; then we would like to encourage you to answer questions about other users by & digikam. in this mailing list, however, English is spoken, you should therefore be powerful in this language.</seg>
<seg id="62">You can also visit the digiplug; visit homepage to learn news on released versions and other information about & digikam; learn.</seg>
<seg id="63">The best start to participate in & digikam; participate is registration in the developer mailing list. instructions for logging in the developer mailing list by & digikam;.</seg>
<seg id="64">When you start & Edit; for the first time, you will be asked where to save your images and your database. you can specify a local, remote or removable folder. simply enter the path name or click the Folder icon Folder icon to select a folder.</seg>
<seg id="65">In the second field you need to specify a local folder on your computer. here the data storage is saved. this path remains the same for all image folders.</seg>
<seg id="66">Later you can add as many folders as you would like to add. & digikam; you will additionally use as an alpha library.</seg>
<seg id="67">If you already have a picture collection on your hard disk, you can specify the top folder that contains images as a base folder. & Edit; considers every subfolder as an album. no image will be changed.</seg>
<seg id="68">& Edit; thirsts recursively the library path in its full depth. you cannot exclude subfolders unless it is iste in hidden folders. this can be done by placing one point in front of the name of the subfolder.</seg>
<seg id="69">If you take an existing folder with photos as a base folder, you will notice that the albums in My Albenlist do not have any photos as symbols. you can change them by taking any photo from the album and put it on the folder icon.</seg>
<seg id="70">Once you have configured the base folder, you can set up your digital camera; then you should learn how to use my albums and my keywords to manage your photos in the albums.</seg>
<seg id="71">Raw file support: if you use the raw mode of your camera, you can also deal with it. support is based on the libraw library. if you want to find out if a special camera is supported, you will find a list of supported raw cameras in the Help menu support.</seg>
<seg id="72">How to set up this and work with raw files is described in the sections of Roh Decoder2 and Roh workflow.</seg>
<seg id="73">An easy-to-use camera interface will be provided for you to connect to your digital camera and download your photos directly in & digicam; albums. more than 1000 digital cameras are supported by the gphoto2 library. of course, every medium and card reader that is supported by your operating system will work together.</seg>
<seg id="74">Modern digital cameras are characterized by the use of Compact & Flash; memory cards and USB or FireWire (IEEE-1394 or i-Link) for data transmission. the camera then appears as disk drive. the connection can also be realized via the Picture Transfer Protocol (PTP) and its derivatives. older cameras may use the serial port (RS-232).</seg>
<seg id="75">Gphoto2 is a free, redistributable software collection for digital cameras that supports an ever increasing number of more than 800 cameras. gphoto2 also supports Picture Transfer Protocol, a widely distributed protocol developed by the International Imaging Industry Association. it allows the transmission of images from digital cameras to computers and other peripherals without the need for additional drivers.</seg>
<seg id="76">Many old digital cameras use the serial port for their communication with the computer. since photos in general are large files and transfers over the serial port are slow, this connection is now deprecated. & digikam; supports these cameras and performs the transmission of images with gphoto2. a complete list of supported cameras can be found under this link.</seg>
<seg id="77">Libgphoto2 has to be created with libexif support to reliably read the thumbnails of digiKam. the Exif support is needed by some libgphoto2 camera operators to read the preview images. if the Exif support is not present in libgphoto2, you may not see thumbnails or the creation could be very slow.</seg>
<seg id="78">One of the most beautiful things on & digikam; is how easy it is to extend its functionality through modules:</seg>
<seg id="79">KIPI modules: the KDE Image Plugins Interface Project (manual) is an approach to develop a common module structure for & digikam;, KPhotoAlbum, Showimg and Gwenview. the goal is to provide the modules with all graphics programs. the settings for the KIPI modules are described in this section.</seg>
<seg id="80">Modules can manipulate pictures in virtually any way as it can be a user. their advantage is that it is much easier to add & digikam; by writing a small module to supplement a function when the changes in & digikam; even perform.</seg>
<seg id="81">To simplify the window, you can either remove the page headers with or LMB; or switch to full screen mode with F11 or Ctrl + Shift + F.</seg>
<seg id="82">Drag and drop pictures works everywhere: you can place an image in another part of the tree, above the horizontal dividing line or to another application window. the only limitation is that a picture cannot be stored in keywords, data list or search.</seg>
<seg id="83">- a file type selection allows you to extract the most common formats: JPEG, PNG, TIFF, Roh, Movies and Audio</seg>
<seg id="84">The text filter is only used for the fields currently displayed in the symbol view. thus the filter works on the filename only if it is displayed in the symbol view. which fields are displayed you can configure in the settings dialog.</seg>
<seg id="85">The view & quot; My Albenlistequot; provides an organized view of your photo albums. all the photos that are stored by & digikam are stored in a single album tree. these albums can be sorted by the folders in which they were created on the disk, after the name of their collection in the album properties or after the date on which the album was first created.</seg>
<seg id="86">If you have set up a scanner, you can also scan a photo directly into an album. select album Import images. you can also add a screenshot directly to an album.</seg>
<seg id="87">To copy or move an image from one album to another, you can move the photo with the mouse to the target album and drop it there. in the then appearing menu you have to select whether the image is moved by moving or copying. simply select all the photos and move them to the target album.</seg>
<seg id="88">An album contains a collection of photos and the album features allow you to enter information about this collection. to access the album features, right click on the album and select Edit properties in the contextual menu.</seg>
<seg id="89">Album Collections: are a method to select your albums so that you can be grouped under a common name. the collection you set will be used to sort your photos after collection from the toolbar or sort view albums by collection. if you want to add or delete new collections, you can do so in the collections for collections.</seg>
<seg id="90">The album date: is used when you sort your albums after date with View albums after date sort.</seg>
<seg id="91">Buttons Elder, Average, New Year: these set the date on that of the oldest, the newest picture or the average of the album. to do this, first try to calculate the average of the images from their EXIF information. if this fails, the date of last modification of each file will be used in this folder instead.</seg>
<seg id="92">If you first have an album in & digikam; open, the first picture in the album is chosen as a symbol for the & quot; My Albenlistequot; this should help you to remember the photos in the album. sometimes the first picture in the album is not representative and you may want to select another photo as a symbol.</seg>
<seg id="93">To select another photo as an album symbol, you must click the picture with the right mouse button and select it in the context menu & quot; As albumPrepreview startenquot;. in addition, you can drag the photo to the album in the list to set it as a symbol.</seg>
<seg id="94">An album can only be included in a collection and collections can't be nested.</seg>
<seg id="95">You can use both methods to organize your photos. you can use both methods to organize your photos.</seg>
<seg id="96">The image window will provide you with the main view of your photos. if you select an album, all images will be displayed in this album in the image window. each photo is displayed in a preview, you can adjust the size of these preview with the two magnifier buttons in the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="97">When you open an album the first time you have to wait briefly while the thumbnails are generated. this can be avoided by using the Tools menu to recreate all thumbnails.</seg>
<seg id="98">Information on each image is displayed below the associated preview. what information is this, you can change settings; set up the albums page and adjust the preview images to your wishes.</seg>
<seg id="99">The preview images have help windows that appear. if you leave the mouse pointer a moment over a picture. the help shows the most important features including all the keywords of a photo. the screenshot at the top of the section introduction to the main window shows such a help window.</seg>
<seg id="100">Photos are all that happened at & digikam; go. albums and tags allow you to organize your pictures in a way that suits you. the image editing shows your photos and allows you to achieve a number of improvements to these. you can choose between viewing the images, a slide show or editing the images.</seg>
<seg id="101">You can open the image editing with a photo by selecting either F4 image editing... or the context menu of the image with the right mouse button and edit.... in the Edit section, you will find a tutorial on how to edit your photos. with image editing, you can view your photos and change them.</seg>
<seg id="102">It may happen that & digikam; the functionality you need is not available. you can open a photo in another program by selecting the context menu with the right mouse button and selecting the program from the File Type submenu.</seg>
<seg id="103">You should note that after processing other image editing programs, there may be problems with the metadata that appears in the image. some programs do not store this data when you save the modified image. thus, this information is lost from the EXIF- and IPTC data, such as orientation, aperture, etc.</seg>
<seg id="104">The easiest way is to click the right mouse button on the preview and select Rotate. in the submenu you can specify the degree of rotation.</seg>
<seg id="105">To change the filename of a photo, right click on the preview and select F2 rename from the context menu. note that you retain the extension (.jpg, .tif, etc;).</seg>
<seg id="106">If you want to delete a photo, it will be moved to the garbage bin of & kde; F8 Delete or Del If you prefer to really delete, you can use this by using Shift; Del.</seg>
<seg id="107">The view & quot; My Datumslistealth; organizes your photos using the data. & digikam; use either the EXIF date or, if this is not available, the date of last modification of the file.</seg>
<seg id="108">If you select a month from the list, all photos of this month will be shown in the image view. you can select days or weeks in the date sheet at the bottom of the calendar view, so that only the photos of the selected days will be shown to you.</seg>
<seg id="109">Photos with keywords provide a flexible and powerful way to organize and catalog your photos. tags are stickers that can be assigned to individual photos or entire groups. once a keyword is assigned to a photo, the photo can be found by selecting this keyword or a search.</seg>
<seg id="110">When a keyword is selected, all the photos marked with this keyword will be displayed.</seg>
<seg id="111">Tags can be sorted in a hierarchical tree. this allows you to logically organize your keywords. you can also find parts of the tree & quot; My keywords listequot; to work together so that you can easily find the keywords you are looking for.</seg>
<seg id="112">The keywords are stored in a database for quick access and assigned keyword in the IPTC data fields of the image, at least for JPEG, so you can also use your keywords in other programs.</seg>
<seg id="113">You can add new keywords by using the right mouse button either on & quot; My keywords, or click on an existing keyword and then select New keyword. if you have clicked on an existing keyword, this will be the foreword of this keyword.</seg>
<seg id="114">You can delete a keyword by clicking on the keyword with the right mouse button and selecting Delete. if you delete a keyword, the photo itself will not be deleted. only the keyword will be removed from this photo.</seg>
<seg id="115">You can change the position of a keyword by dragging it to the desired position in the tree and dropping it there. then a menu appears that gives you the possibility to move the keyword. a keyword can be at a time only once in the tree.</seg>
<seg id="116">You can change the properties of a keyword by clicking it with the right mouse button and selecting Edit in the context menu. you can change the name of the keyword and the icon in the tree & quot; My keywords quot;.</seg>
<seg id="117">To select another photo as an album symbol, you must click the picture with the right mouse button and select Add as album preview in the context menu. in addition, you can drag the photo to the album in the list to set it as a symbol.</seg>
<seg id="118">To be able to use keywords, you first have to assign your photos with keywords. this can be done in two ways: once you have selected the photos you want to add to a keyword, you can click on the corresponding keyword in the tree & quot; My keywords quot; drag and drop it. alternatively, you can also click with the right mouse button on the preview of the pictures and select from the contextual menu.</seg>
<seg id="119">You can add a photo with any number of words. the photo is displayed once you select one of the keywords assigned to it. in this way you can enter a keyword for each person in a photo, one for the place where the photo was taken, one for the event in which it was made etc.</seg>
<seg id="120">Once you have provided a photo with keywords, it will be displayed in the main window under the preview of the image.</seg>
<seg id="121">You can remove a keyword in which you can use the right mouse button to open the popup context menu and select Remove from the Tags menu. the menu only displays the keywords associated with the photo.</seg>
<seg id="122">The timeline view shows a time-dependent adjustable histogram of the number of images per time unit. a selection frame can be moved over this histogram. to select a time frame, you only need to click on the lower rectangle of the selection frame, which indicates the time unit. this displays all the associated images in the main window.</seg>
<seg id="123">In the field below, you can enter a title and save your selection. it then appears in the list below.</seg>
<seg id="124">Includes all the elements of the database: names, reviews, keywords, keywords, albums, collections, date stamps and more.</seg>
<seg id="125">Next to the search box, a small lamp is the green when finding hits. if you click here the filter will be deleted and all images will be shown again. if the search has not found, then the lamp becomes red.</seg>
<seg id="126">The more advanced search tool is hidden in the tab in the left sidebar with the binoculars. if you open this you get a simple search box as described above. you can save this search here but as a live search, which always filters what you entered as search criteria. after you have saved the appearing filter in the list.</seg>
<seg id="127">If you are satisfied with your selection, press the head OK and the search will be done. the results will be displayed in the View My Search list in the main window. if you want to change your search again, you only need to select the respective entry from the View My Search list and select an option in its context menu.</seg>
<seg id="128">If you select to edit search, the search form will appear again with the previously entered search information. if you select to edit as advanced search, the dialog will appear for advanced search to change your previous search. more information can be found in the Advanced search tool.</seg>
<seg id="129">If you want to delete an existing search from the list, select Delete from the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="130">The Advanced search provides you with an extended search form with many search options, with which you can search in certain fields of & digikam; s database.</seg>
<seg id="131">The list of search rules is used to set the options for a search query in the database. an option can be added to this list with search group or delete it. each option can be connected to others through the logical operations All..., One..., Not... or At least...</seg>
<seg id="132">Each image is characterized by a long number with a special technique using the hair algorithm. this allows to compare images by comparing these signatures. the smaller the difference between two pictorial signatures, the more they correspond. this technique is applied in three areas.</seg>
<seg id="133">Similar entries: this is an area in which you can drop every picture to find a similar. by means of a swellert, the result selection can be enlarged or reduced. if you push a picture from anywhere via the icon of inaccurate search in the left sidebar, it will open and you can drop it there.</seg>
<seg id="134">Sketch: free hand color sketch: draw a quick sketch and & digikam; find the right images. here too, a threshold value can be set.</seg>
<seg id="135">This tab provides an intuitive card search tool based on the Marble mini program. you can zoom in or out with the mouse wheel or hold it down and move it. move it while you press the left mouse button. press Ctrl; left mouse button to move a square. all images within these coordinates are filtered and displayed. of course, this requires your images to contain geo-data.</seg>
<seg id="136">In the field below you can specify a name for your geo filter. it will then be added for later use of the list below. it works like a live geo folder.</seg>
<seg id="137">& digikam; provides a luminous table in a separate window that allows you to easily compare images. it works with all supported image file formats, including raw files.</seg>
<seg id="138">Select one or more images from any view in the main window and then use Ctrl; L Add to the illuminated table from the context menu. the selection will be added to the illuminated table and its window will open. if you are back in the main window, you can quickly open the illuminated table with L Tools.</seg>
<seg id="139">From the preview toolbar, you can drag and drop the images you want to compare in the left or right pane of the window. a small arrow shows you which copy in which window area to see. if you select to synchronize from the toolbar and perform zoo and / or move operations on one of the images, they are also executed in the other image. you can therefore compare the same area of the two images.</seg>
<seg id="140">Another mode is better suited for sorting out from a picture series. if you navigate in pairs from the toolbar, the two first images are automatically loaded into the pane to compare it. now use the left mouse button on any preview image to display it in the left pane.</seg>
<seg id="141">Of course, the normal deletion actions also work directly from the lighting table such as F4 File Editing....</seg>
<seg id="142">All image information from the right sidebar of the main window is available for both thumbnails in the illuminated table. this makes it easy to link visual differences with exposure data.</seg>
<seg id="143">At the bottom of each area you will find a built-in pivot function that you can recognize on the crossed arrows. to swing the visible area of the image, you have to click them and hold the & LMB; then both images will be displayed in the same image area.</seg>
<seg id="144">Zoom in just the same way as in other views. just use the zoom slider below the images or Ctrl; mouse wheel to zoom in and out. this happens in both pictures when you are in the preview mode.</seg>
<seg id="145">Digital inventory management considers every part of the process that follows after the image has been made to final output and permanent storage. each of the photos records, scans or stores digital photos performs a form of digital inventory management. however, most of us do not make this in a systematic and efficient way.</seg>
<seg id="146">We give you a tool, a plan and practical tips on how to back up, find, protect, and reuse your pictures. we will focus on the process for digital photographers who use & digikam. we will consider downloading, renaming, removing, converting, grouping, securing, evaluating, waxing, archiving, editing, waiting and exporting image files.</seg>
<seg id="147">& quot; Digital inventory management records, indexes, categorizes, secures, searches, transformations, and exports content that has a monetary or cultural value.</seg>
<seg id="148">Metadata is defined as data about data. metadata is data that provides information about or documentation from other data managed by an application or environment, according to your definition.</seg>
<seg id="149">I dare to say if you find more than 1000 photos on your computer, then you need no longer inventory management to find a certain photo. if you do not even know how many photos you have, then use certainly not & digikam;. the approach to save metadata in both a database and image files guarantees very fast searches and secure archiving that you can freely access with other programs, platforms and formats.</seg>
<seg id="150">The first thing you need to do and know before you incorporate something into your system is the structure of information structure in contrast to the data structure. your image files have to be organized somehow on your computer. you need to decide if you want to have access to your photos, whether you want to save them to a dedicated drive or on a network drive & etc.</seg>
<seg id="151">You may be happy with this structure. holiday pictures can quickly be found on your location unless you were in one year several times in the same place. if you make enough photos, then you will use subfolders like & eg; 2008-01, 2008-02 & etc; then export is a folder for images you print or publish on a website.</seg>
<seg id="152">Professional photographers have other requirements, e.g. versioning of photos, archiving, workflows, constant supply of images to different themes and a large number of everything. within 10 years 95% archives and 5% work files will have and you will then not want to reorganize your structure for this content.</seg>
<seg id="153">What types of files fit together? the separation of file types makes batch processing easier. separate new from old files.</seg>
<seg id="154">The separation of original and working files simplifies a backup strategy and migration. you will always know if you are looking for an original or a derivative image.</seg>
<seg id="155">We also recommend the Save Metadata option in the Edit Settings page. this ensures that EXIF and IPTC data are written into the file. if you forget this, you can subsequently save the metadata from the database in the files by selecting the respective point in the Album menu.</seg>
<seg id="156">Now you have a lot of information in your database, but what happens if you want to change what? added & digikam; a metadata editor for a number of selected attributes. these are of course the most important ones.</seg>
<seg id="157">Now the real work begins, as you should now assign keywords, captions and a rating to each photo. of course, you can select all the images that require the same attribute and then set the value. they start best with the rating or ranking. this makes sense as you can concentrate on the best photos during the next work.</seg>
<seg id="158">Now let's talk with keywords, keywords, as you frequently call other programs, or categories. all three are synonyms for the same thing.</seg>
<seg id="159">When you import catalogued images from another source with embedded keywords, then & digikam; automatically create the tree for you or insert the images to the right place. changing the hierarchy within the tree is no problem and can simply be done by dragging a subtree to another.</seg>
<seg id="160">The graphic shows how different meta-meta is overlapping. this is a very crude representation, since each block of metadata is in truth from many sections. file names and calendar data are properties of all images.</seg>
<seg id="161">Enough of the keywords - the next section refers to captions or comments, the third important tool to catalog your metadata.</seg>
<seg id="162">Most of the time you just want to see your photos, you want to share them with your friends, family, other photographers and agencies. you are certainly interested in how your photos arrive.</seg>
<seg id="163">Look at this panorama. from the distance is not even a beautiful beach panorama. if you look at it closer then you catch some details to see people, the place.</seg>
<seg id="164">And now I tell you that this is the landing place of the Allies & quot; Omaha Beachquot; in the French Normandy 60 years after the landing. wow! you begin to dream, to have associations, memories, the historical period is again present, you may even hear the silence.</seg>
<seg id="165">For others who consider your photos, the title may be more important than the image itself to create an interest. if you show pictures you should tell a story. remember, the key is to transmit the meaning to the viewer, to help him understand the subject that you are moving to understand what you understand.</seg>
<seg id="166">It is fine if an image is not perfect, if it has the strength only to work with a label for itself alone.</seg>
<seg id="167">With & digikam; you can save as much text, in an internationalized alphabet (UTF-8), as a lettering. you can even export it for a selection of images. if you export your images to web galleries, these labels will not tell you a second time for publication.</seg>
<seg id="168">Remember the times ahead of GPS? when you had to find a different city without a navigation system? wasn't Earth a boring planet in front of GoogleEarth? well, because with pictures, the train of the spatial presentation is already running with speed of light.</seg>
<seg id="169">The possibilities to exploit the geolocation are countless and will become deep in the future. I'm sure that one day, in the near future, you can virtually repeat your travels with Google Earth images. you can also export the images to Gallery2, Picasaweb, Flickr & etc; with the GoogleMaps viewer.</seg>
<seg id="170">& quot; Copyleft is a pun with copyright and uses the practice to use copyrights to remove restrictions on the distribution and modification of copies. the same freedoms are also valid in all changed versions, so also for the work of others.</seg>
<seg id="171">The following description tells you which information in the setup page of & digikam; should be stored as information:</seg>
<seg id="172">Author (synonym for creator and writer): this field should contain your name, or the name of the person who created the photo. if it is not desired to protect the name of the photographer, e.g. to protect the identity of the photographer, then the name of a company or organization may not be changed. this field does not support commas or semicolons as separator.</seg>
<seg id="173">Author title (synonym for author): linked to the author. this field contains the photographer's job description. examples of this may be title as: employee photographer, freelance photographer or independent commercial photographer.</seg>
<seg id="174">Editor (synonym for providers): use the provider field to identify who offers the photo. this does not necessarily have to be the author. if the photographer works for a news agency like Reuters or Associated Press, these organizations can be listed here that you offer the picture to others.</seg>
<seg id="175">It is very important to fill the author and copyright sections although they do not offer protection against misuse. anyone who has a little more than basic knowledge in the work with calculator can delete or modify this, in the image embedded metadata. for private persons, this is very important for the majority of your photos. for professionals and semi-professionals this protection is very important.</seg>
<seg id="176">The digital watermark is unique per picture. & digikam; will provide such a module for batch processing in the near future.</seg>
<seg id="177">Topics: disk failures, disk failure, electric shocks, ECC, transmission errors, ageing of storage media, restoration, redundancy, disaster prevention, lifespan, temperature, data size, dissemination superstitions</seg>
<seg id="178">Of course we don't talk about CDs that have been lost on the street or on a fire. these kinds of losses are the same that can happen to you in traditional paper photos or negatives. in this section you will find problems with the so-called New Media.</seg>
<seg id="179">Kroll onTRACK, the world's largest data recovery company, has some interesting statistics what reasons a data loss has.</seg>
<seg id="180">To fight the problem with CDs / DVDs, these must be treated cautiously and you can't trust you for more than a few years. of course you can also buy CDs and DVDs in archive quality which last longer, harder to get and much more expensive. there are offers about gold coated DVDs, & dollars; 2 the piece that claim a lifetime of 100 years.</seg>
<seg id="181">CD / DVD discs can be unreadable but you can reduce this risk in which you use good disks and good recording devices and store them in the right way. the best DVD recording devices are not much more expensive than the cheapest, but you write a lot more reliable.</seg>
<seg id="182">CDs and DVDs are very susceptible to errors even if they have just been written. that's why they use a control sum mechanism to protect themselves. 75% of the data is only effective data, the rest we need for formatting and control summons. despite this massive protection they age through chemical ageing, ultraviolet light, scratches, dust & etc;</seg>
<seg id="183">For faulty CDs and DVDs there is a reasonably priced program called IsoBuster which seems to do wonders for CDs and DVDs. it runs under Windows and & Linux; but is not yet available for Macs. there are also similar applications to read corrupted data from damaged disks, hard disks, flash media, USB drives, etc.</seg>
<seg id="184">Optical media: Blu-ray Disks seem to capture the format war against HD DVD. a dual layer Blu-ray disc can store 50 GB and thus almost six times the capacity of a dual layer DVD with 8.5 GB.</seg>
<seg id="185">Slow-burn with a good recording device on high-quality media in a non-propriated format. after that, read the media with a description, date & author mark and then store on a clean, dark dry and protected site. do not forget to copy the data to the next generation of media before you can read the latest piece of hardware or software that can read these media.</seg>
<seg id="186">Disk manufacturers keep your statistics for themselves. your manufacturer's warranties include a new disk, but not the data. Google provides a large field study on the error mechanisms of hard drives: disk error study</seg>
<seg id="187">The most common cause of failure increases dramatically. electronic parts of the controller are the most common cause of error, SMART cannot detect these errors. some of SMART permanently identify errors. the expected lifetime is between 4 and 5 years.</seg>
<seg id="188">This is only the total loss due to overvoltage. of course, you can also lose data loss due to a power failure before you have secured the files, but these losses can normally be restored without major problems.</seg>
<seg id="189">While most electrical devices do not make much of electric shocks, this can cause severe damage to devices with computer chips and high-speed processors. these anomalies can cause serious damage. on your computer, these anomalies can cause persistent keyboards, complete data loss, hardware ageing, destroyed motherboards and other defects.</seg>
<seg id="190">The most widespread protection against current peaks is an overvoltage protection. this is a device that absorbs some of the energy heat and grounded the rest. it is usually available in the form of a connector bar. but remember that not every connector bar also contains overvoltage protection.</seg>
<seg id="191">If you are looking for an overvoltage protection, make sure that it complies with UL 1449 standard, which guarantees a certain minimum of protection. you should also take care that it provides protection against lightning strikes and thus protects the properly connected devices.</seg>
<seg id="192">Since an overvoltage of any cable can be used to your computer, you should make sure that all peripheral devices connected to your system are protected. some manufacturers provide overvoltage protection, which also includes a telephone connection for your modem. others offer connection options for the coaxial cable of the cable modem and the TV card.</seg>
<seg id="193">If you have a laptop, then you will need a portable overvoltage protection. a variety of these devices are specially developed for notebooks and therefore very small and they also contain the protection for the modem.</seg>
<seg id="194">While an overvoltage protection protects your system from minor fluctuations in the power lines it will not really help you in a complete failure. even a failure of a few seconds can lead to the loss of irreplaceable data. it can therefore be useful to invest in a uninterrupted power supply.</seg>
<seg id="195">In addition to protecting against surge voltages, these devices can automatically provide battery energy when a power failure occurs. some models allow you to save your data and run the system ordered. if you purchase a UPS then you should be sure that they meet the same quality requirements as overvoltage protection. furthermore, the lifetime of the battery and the supplied software is interesting.</seg>
<seg id="196">Consider the potential risk your computer system is exposed to and compare your safety in case of current disruptions with the cost of avoiding them. a high-quality overvoltage protection can cost you up to 50 euro; 20. this is only a small price difference if you consider how well your computer is protected.</seg>
<seg id="197">The Amazon Web Service includes S3 - Simple Storage Service - a simple storage service. with the right configuration, you can mount it as a drive under & Linux;, Mac, and Windows. this allows you to use this as a backup destination for your software.</seg>
<seg id="198">You are at home in comparison to the hard drives at home, however, very expensive - 40 GB costs & dollars; 75 per year and 400 GB cost & dollars; 500. in addition, you need to send the data about the comparatively slow internet.</seg>
<seg id="199">The solutions are therefore only suitable as a solution against a local data loss of the most important images. this is not a bad solution, but it is not a general backup solution.</seg>
<seg id="200">Picasaweb (Google), Flickr (Yahoo) and the photo community 23hq.com provide online storage services that are available on photos. their free memory is limited to 1 GB and you will not want to have your pictures in full resolution online. the professional version provides you more available in case of Flickr. for $25 per year you get unlimited memory, which should be checked in reality first.</seg>
<seg id="201">From the point of view of the data backup, the web solutions are very safe. thanks to the TCP protocol, transmission errors are automatically cleaned up and included in the large companies in the offer a backup and a distributed memory. thus, they are safe.</seg>
<seg id="202">The diagram illustrates the elements of the transmission chain in the computer. all transfers are susceptible to transmission errors. the file system ZFS and btrfs ensure at least the data integrity between the operating system and the hard disk.</seg>
<seg id="203">The worst thing about this is that nobody tells you when a transmission error occurred, not when this happened in your hardware. all these disturbances remain undetected until you have one day to open a photo and this is destroyed to your surprise. no one seems to have thought about it. the Internet with its TCP protocol is a much more secure data path than the one in your computer.</seg>
<seg id="204">Unreliable power supplies are another source of transmission losses because they generate interferences in the data streams. in normal file systems, these errors remain unnoticed.</seg>
<seg id="205">Even if you are not particularly affected by transmission problems, you should look into the future. as early as 2010, you will see thousands of errors per year.</seg>
<seg id="206">ZFS of Sun Microsystems seems to be one of two candidates that can handle plate errors at a low level and are highly scalable. it is open source, with many patents and is available under a GPL incompatible license for Solaris and Leopard. we can only hope that it will soon also be available for & Linux; and Windows.</seg>
<seg id="207">Oracle has launched an own initiative with its btrfs filesystem. it is still in alpha status. it uses the same protection mechanisms that ZFS uses and is also available for & Linux; but it is not part of the kernel yet.</seg>
<seg id="208">Do not underestimate this! these two factors are responsible for 86% of the data loss in the notebook and 46% in the workplace systems. for notebooks, the share of thefts is 50%.</seg>
<seg id="209">Data loss due to viruses is less common than most people think. it leads to less damage than for example theft or new installations. and it is currently limited to Microsoft systems; Apple users only know very few viruses and under & Linux; has long been seen no more.</seg>
<seg id="210">Open source file systems are less prone to data loss than proprietary systems: wrong, NTFS is minimal better than ext3, ReiserFS, JFs and XFS to name the most common file systems.</seg>
<seg id="211">Journaling file systems prevent corrupted data and data loss: incorrect, only the speed of the investigation process during a sudden interruption during surgery is higher and an undefined status is avoided. however, if a file was not stored completely before the problem occurred, it is lost.</seg>
<seg id="212">Viruses are the greatest threat to digital data: false, theft and human errors are the main causes of data loss.</seg>
<seg id="213">Sensors from digital cameras are 1-2 stop settings from fundamental physical limitations. it means that while the technology is further developed there is a natural limit for this progress. sensitivity and noise characteristics for all types of light sensors are not far away from this limit.</seg>
<seg id="214">Today's cameras are moving towards the 10 megapixel range. even if this resolution is too high for compact cameras and the end result is worse. even DSLR cameras have your limit at 10-12 megapixels. for higher resolutions, you need a full-format sensor (24x36mm) or larger formats.</seg>
<seg id="215">A 750GB hard drive is available today for 100 & euro; so don't make anybody responsible for data loss. 6% of all PCs are affected by a data loss every year. so secure your data after a plan and test this backup before you make any dangerous as the reinstallation of your operating system, replacement of disks or the size change of hard drives.</seg>
<seg id="216">Suppose you make your backup daily on an external SATA drive. if, then one day, a flash will hit you lucky if the drive was not connected at the moment.</seg>
<seg id="217">A disaster strikes locally and destroys a lot. forget aeroplanes: fire, water, electricity, children and thefts are dangerous enough for your data. they usually affect a whole room or the entire house.</seg>
<seg id="218">Therefore, disaster preparedness always means a non-local storage. bring your backups up the stairs, to the adjacent house, to your office or something similar.</seg>
<seg id="219">There is another advantage of physical separation: as mentioned above is a common cause for data loss despite backup the panic. if you have a backup which is not immediately available, then you can save it one day.</seg>
<seg id="220">Complete backup: a complete backup of all files to be backed up. it is a snapshot without history and represents a complete copy at a time.</seg>
<seg id="221">Differential lock: a backup of the files that have been changed since the last complete backup. generates a complete snapshot at two points: the complete backup and the last differential lock.</seg>
<seg id="222">Incremental backup: a backup of the files that have been changed since the last backup. creates multiple snapshots. you can restore the original status at any time in which such a backup has been made. this backup comes closest to a versioning system except that it is only scanned and not continuous.</seg>
<seg id="223">Rsync is a wonderful small tool that you can easily set up on your machines. unlike scripted FTP sessions or other types of file transfer scripts rsync copies only the difference of files that have really been changed. this happens compressed and if you want to increase security via ssh.</seg>
<seg id="224">Backup important images directly after you have saved them on your computer to a DVD or another optical media.</seg>
<seg id="225">This procedure allows you enough time to detect and restore lost. at the same time, you will get a complete daily version of the last 7-14 days, a weekly snapshot for at least one month and a snapshot for each month. any further dilution should be done manually after you have made a complete review.</seg>
<seg id="226">Topics: metadata in the image file stored IPTC information, associated XMP files, retained original, memory, scalability, media, reinventing images and metadata, copying images to the next generation of media, applications, operating systems, virtualization, visual equipment,..., use of the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="227">So that valuable pictures will survive the next 40 years, that is approximately the period in which you really are interested in you because they remind you of your childhood or youth, there are two strategies that should be considered:</seg>
<seg id="228">As the future is unpredictable due to your nature, you need to consider and re-evaluate everything that is today. unfortunately, there is no other way than to forge a certain vigilance. every 5-8 years you should ask yourself how the current system is backwards compatible. the less variants you have used in the past, the easier it is to evaluate the questions of the future.</seg>
<seg id="229">This question should actually be answered by the explanations in this document. use or change to open standards supported by many applications.</seg>
<seg id="230">Virtualization is available for everyone nowadays. so if you have an old system that is important to read your images, then keep it and install it in a virtual machine for later use.</seg>
<seg id="231">On the other hand, the advice is quite simple: everytime you change your computer architecture, your memory and fuses, or your file format, you should check your library and if necessary convert to a newer standard. stay with open standards.</seg>
<seg id="232">Scalability is the printing print for the ability to change a system in its size. this actually means increasing.</seg>
<seg id="233">Let's assume that you have planned the scalability with you and the area you want to enlarge on a dedicated disk or partition. with * nix systems like & Linux; you can copy this area and shift it to a new disk:</seg>
<seg id="234">Check with the command dmesg if your new disk has been detected by the system, but do not hang it.</seg>
<seg id="235">/ dev / sdb [#] of = / dev / sdb [#] of = / dev / sdc # source is / dev / sdc / dollar; parted resize / dev / sdc # source is / dev / sdc # source; resize2fs / dev / sadc1 # change the resize2fs / dev / sdc # source file size if necessary</seg>
<seg id="236">Open source standards have the great advantage of an open specification. even if one day no software can read it, then you can create it yourself.</seg>
<seg id="237">GIF is a proprietary, patented format that slowly disappears from the market, so you shouldn't use it any more.</seg>
<seg id="238">PNG has been developed as an open source standard which should replace GIF. it can save much more. it is lossless, supports XMP, Exinf and IPTC metadata, 16-bit per color channel and full transparency. the disadvantage is that it requires relative many administrative information, but not as many as TIFF and a slow compression.</seg>
<seg id="239">TIFF was widely distributed as image format. TIFF can be stored in uncompressed form or in a container with lossless compression algorithm (default). with some cameras you can save your images in this format. however, a problem is that this format has been adapted by many people. there are therefore more than 50 different types and not all applications can work with all types.</seg>
<seg id="240">DNG The Digital Negative File Format is a royalty-free and open shell format developed by Adobe Systems. DNG has been developed on the basis of the need to unify the camera data formats. it is based on the TIFF / EP format and is committed to the use of metadata.</seg>
<seg id="241">This is possibly one of the reasons why, around 2001, Adobe's XML-based XMP technology has introduced to replace the & quot; Image Resource block quot; technology of the 90s. XMP stands for & quot; Extensible Metadata Platformquot;, a mixture of XML and RDF. file information is stored by extension & quot; .xmpquot; which stands for XML / RDF.</seg>
<seg id="242">Many photographers prefer to archive an original of your recording, mostly in the raw format, to archive. XMP also fits because it stores the metadata separately from the image file. however, it can cause problems when linking the metadata file and the image file, and as mentioned above, you should consider whether you use DNG as a container and put everything together there.</seg>
<seg id="243">The Dublin Core Metadata Initiative is an open organization dedicated to fully compatible online metadata standards that support a wide range of applications and business models. DCMI's activities include architecture and modeling, discussions and collaborative work in the DCMI communities, annual conferences and workshops, standard connections and enlightening efforts to achieve a wide acceptance of metadata standards and practices.</seg>
<seg id="244">Import images from the camera, the card reader or the scanner. as long as the images are on the camera screen, you can use this as temporary security.</seg>
<seg id="245">Convert raw files to DNG and save them to your raw archive. this function is not yet implemented.</seg>
<seg id="246">You can use external programs for fine editing. if you re-edit the images again, then you should add the metadata again. these were sometimes cut off by other programs.</seg>
<seg id="247">Protect the copyrighted images for the copyright with a digital watermark. only export them to web galleries, code in MPEG, use in contact sheets, print etc;</seg>
<seg id="248">The camera interface is not the only way to get your photos in & digikam; in the Adding One Photo to an album you will find a description of how to add photos you already have on your hard disk. however, the camera interface provides you many advanced settings for importing images to your legacy database.</seg>
<seg id="249">To use your digital camera with & digicom; to use, connect it to the computer, switch the camera to the display mode and turn it on. a further description can be found in the manual of your camera.</seg>
<seg id="250">When you start the camera interface, it will try to connect to your camera. if the connection is made, a finished indicator appears at the bottom end and the thumbnails of all photos on the camera are displayed. some cameras do not display thumbnails. if this is the case, the file names and a symbol for the application will be displayed on the camera.</seg>
<seg id="251">Before downloading the photos on your computer, you may need the camera information for each entry. with the features and metadata from the camera interface, you can see the properties of an entry or its metadata.</seg>
<seg id="252">This dialog displays file properties and the photo information stored internally by the camera. a symbol indicates that the image has not yet been downloaded to your computer. note that some digital cameras do not have all the information available.</seg>
<seg id="253">The tab Metadata shows the internal metadata such as Exif, Manufacturer remark, GPS, etc. of the image. this information is the same as in the metadata sidebar from the main window of & digikam; or image processing. note that this metadata is not available in some digital cameras.</seg>
<seg id="254">The easiest way to download photos on your computer is the click on the button to download and then download the selection from all. this downloads all photos from their camera into a single album in & digikam. downloading the photos will not be deleted and we recommend you to check if the pictures were safely downloaded into an album before you delete the photos from the camera.</seg>
<seg id="255">If you do not want to download all the photos, you can only select the desired ones with the standard selection methods of & kde; as soon as you have selected the photos, use the Download button and then download Selected. download the Selected button until you have selected some photos.</seg>
<seg id="256">If your camera supports this, an option New download is available. these images have not been downloaded from & digikam so far. in this case, the new images are marked with a star in the preview window. if you select this option, of course only the new images will be downloaded.</seg>
<seg id="257">When you download or download the selected albums, a dialog will appear where you can select the target album in which the photos are stored. the list of existing albums will be shown, as usual folders. then, select the folder list from the list and press OK.</seg>
<seg id="258">After selecting the target album, press OK, and & Edit; load the photos from the camera to the album.</seg>
<seg id="259">Once you have downloaded the desired photos, you can delete them from the camera. you can delete all of them at once by using the Delete Delete button. if you want to delete only a few, you have to select them first and use Delete Delete.</seg>
<seg id="260">Please note that there is no way to restore photos that you have deleted from the camera. the photos will not be moved to the folder from & kde; they will be deleted completely. you should check carefully if the photos were successfully deleted in a & digiplug, before you delete them from the camera. if you want to completely erase the camera finder, you should do so using the camera menu, as this is much faster.</seg>
<seg id="261">Cameras use as filenames for the photos often not particularly meaningful names. the file names are usually reused after the photos are deleted from the camera. this can lead to double filenames in case you upload photos from different shooting sets into the same album. therefore, it may be useful to integrate the date and time on which the image has been made into the file name.</seg>
<seg id="262">In the next section, you will find options for rotating and mirroring the image and for date-based subdirectories. if you use this latter option, you will automatically create a folder per day.</seg>
<seg id="263">The options during the transfer will open three more options that will be performed before the photos are stored on the disk. the first two affect the information about the author in the standard car identity section. if you select this, the corresponding entries are copied from the Exif information into the IPTC fields. with the last option you can correct date & time for all downloaded images.</seg>
<seg id="264">For example, if you want another date format than the standard format, you can use the prefix photo%%% M:% M:% M:% M:% S. turn on the date & time option. for further customization, you should read the help of the strftime command.</seg>
<seg id="265">If you use the option camera filenames, you have the option to change the file names in lower case letters when you download. or lower case letters if you prefer this.</seg>
<seg id="266">The new filename, which & digikam; uses for a photo, is displayed below the name that the camera provides in the preview. your settings for renaming will be saved and used automatically when you open the camera window next time.</seg>
<seg id="267">& digikam; can use all information about the orientation of the camera to the time point of recording to perform an automatic rotation during download. not all cameras provide this information. in the section bar metadata you can read more details about the information that your camera embedded in the photo.</seg>
<seg id="268">The automatic rotation is normally switched on, and if your camera does not provide this information, & digikam; the photo in the original orientation. if you want to turn off the automatic turn, use the Advanced button and select the automatic rotation at the bottom of the window.</seg>
<seg id="269">If your camera provides information about the date on which the photo was taken, you can use it to automatically create sub-albums in the target album. all images with the same date are loaded into the same sub-album. not all cameras provide this information. in the section bar meta data, you can check which information your camera could have embedded in the photos.</seg>
<seg id="270">This option is normally off, and in this case saves & digikam; the photos directly in the target album. if you want to change this, you need to turn on this option. use the Advanced button and select the date-based sub-albums at the bottom of the window.</seg>
<seg id="271">The easiest way to upload photos from your computer to your camera is to download. then select Upload. the file selection dialog & kde; appears where you can select the files to be uploaded. you can also select more than one file with the standard & kde; methods.</seg>
<seg id="272">After the image selection is done, ask & Edit; you where the images are to be uploaded. a folder selection dialog for the camera appears. select the folder you want and press OK to start uploading. the images are not deleted from your computer.</seg>
<seg id="273">GPS (Global Positioning System) is used as a generic term in this document. this means a position specified in longitude and latitude and can be displayed on a map. the data can be determined by the American GPS, the Russian GLONAS, the European GALILEO or any other system.</seg>
<seg id="274">Not only for professional photographers could it be interesting to link a picture with a precise geographic location. not everyone uses a plane to map an area through automatic recording of the GPS data. environment planners, military, police, architecture offices and real estate agents can use this ability.</seg>
<seg id="275">If you later forgot where exactly the photo was taken, you can open a browser that shows the area. if you want to send a postcard to another, or simply want to document the location of the photo, or just want to document this aspect, it is good to save the position data of a photo.</seg>
<seg id="276">The question is how do the GPS data come into the picture? first, you should know that exiv2 supports many GPS data fields, such as direction, saddle and map references. there are at least three ways to achieve this. directly with the right hardware, via post-processing of the GPS data and image files with the KIPI module for geographic mapping (manual) and last on manual input of known places.</seg>
<seg id="277">As far as we know, there is currently no camera that has integrated a GPS unit. but there are a few working with GPS receivers. either as map module or by transmission of data with a cable or Bluetooth.</seg>
<seg id="278">Cameras with GPS interface: CoyoteEye iPAQ Ike Kodak DCS Pro Nikon DSLR Ricoh Pro G3 Sony</seg>
<seg id="279">Downloading the GPS data from a device can be done with gpsman or gpsbabel. however, you must save these data in GPX format, as this is the only format supported by the module for geographical mapping.</seg>
<seg id="280">There are various programs for & Windows; and Mac OS, which can extract and correlate the data of images and from the GPS. on the following page you can do the same under & Linux; make: gpsCorr or gpsPhoto</seg>
<seg id="281">If you know the longitude and latitude or other data, you can use this script, which works with the ExifTool of Phil Harvey. it uses the accidentals of hairy coordinates which are created e.g. by maps.google.</seg>
<seg id="282">Maps.google.com does not show any European street maps. here are some European sites, at least in French, German and Spanish, showing all navigation details for Europe.</seg>
<seg id="283">& digikam; try to give you so much control over his work procedures as possible. there are many settings that change the behavior of & digikam. to access these settings, you need to choose Edit Settings; you can switch between these by clicking on the icons on the left.</seg>
<seg id="284">Select Action can be displayed on embedded preview or editing image editing. you specify the default behavior of & digikam; specify when you click on an entry in the main view.</seg>
<seg id="285">This page contains, as shown below, the standardization and copyright data. these data are automatically written into the corresponding IPTC data fields if the option was selected when downloading from the camera interface.</seg>
<seg id="286">Car title is a synonym for discolourimer: this field should contain the photographer's job title. these can be names such as a photographer, freelance photographer or independent, commercial photographer. as this is a more detailed description of the author's field, it must also be filled.</seg>
<seg id="287">Editor is a synonym for providers: use this field to specify the photo. this does not have to be the author if he works for a news agency like Reuters or Associated Press, then these organizations should be listed here as this is the picture of the other & quot; anbieta quot;. if the image is a stock photo, then the group or agency that provides the image will be listed here.</seg>
<seg id="288">The IPTC actions store the data in the corresponding IPTC rims. this ensures that the metadata is permanently contained in the image and not only in the database of & digikam; this metadata is also available to other programs and can be imported in & digice; imported without going lost.</seg>
<seg id="289">Save image labels as embedded captions (JFIF) in JPEG images: this synchronizes the comments you add to your photos, with the inscriptions embedded in the pictures.</seg>
<seg id="290">The Settings page contains all the information that will appear when the mouse pointer rests over a file in the main window. depending on the selected option, this information is displayed or not.</seg>
<seg id="291">& # 160; Edit; supports a number of different image formats and some video and audio formats. to specify which file types & digikam; to indicate which file types & digikam; display, you can add and remove the file extensions of this list.</seg>
<seg id="292">The default settings can be reset by pressing the Update button to the right of each category.</seg>
<seg id="293">The settings of the luminaire by & digikam; can be set on this page to the default values. however, every time you open the lighting table these settings are switched on if possible. however, some pictures have different sizes and the synchronous mode is not available. the option & quot; In the entire image size ladenquot; should you use only on fast computers. if you have one, then you can get better viewing results.</seg>
<seg id="294">By default, image editing uses a black background behind the displayed photos. if you prefer a different color, you can select it here. you can turn off the toolbar if you use image processing in full screen mode.</seg>
<seg id="295">Over- and underexposed areas of an image can be marked with dark or light color in the image. these colors are defined here. in image processing this View Mode with F10 and F11 can be switched on and off.</seg>
<seg id="296">Chroma-Subsampling means that the images are encoded in higher resolution of luminance than in colour information. please read this article in Wikipedia for more details.</seg>
<seg id="297">With the PNG compressing setting, you can reduce the size of PNG files. this operation does not reduce image quality since PNG is using a lossless algorithm. the only effect is that the image data requires more time to unpack and unpack. if you have a fast computer, you can set this value to a high compression.</seg>
<seg id="298">With the option to compress TIFF files, you can turn the default compression algorithm for TIFF images. this reduces the size of the TIFF images. it has no influence on image quality, since the default algorithm works lossless.</seg>
<seg id="299">With the Lossless JPEG 2000 files setting, you can save lossless. even if you select the loss-based setting, the ratio between quality loss and file size is far better than at normal JPEG. when this paragraph was written, metadata was not supported yet, but was in the planning.</seg>
<seg id="300">In the earlier versions of & digikam, image editing was only a picture viewer for photos. currently, it develops very quickly to a tool for manipulating your photos. with this dialog you can change the settings of image editing.</seg>
<seg id="301">The standard assumption is that all green pixels are the same. if the linear green pixels of the CCD sensor react more sensitive to ultraviolet light than the pixels of odd lines, this difference creates a grid pattern in the output. this option distinguishes the image a bit soft, but eliminates the 2x2 grid patterns with the VNG- or the AHD quality method.</seg>
<seg id="302">If this option is set, the white balance of the camera is used. otherwise, if set, the automatic color balance is used.</seg>
<seg id="303">This setting is used only if the white balance is not set. default is to use a fixed color balance based on a white card that was photographed in sunlight.</seg>
<seg id="304">This setting is only supported for Fuji Super CCD SLR cameras. using the second sensor has the effect that underexposed images get more details in the top lights in four steps. this option is ignored for other cameras.</seg>
<seg id="305">The default is it's the pointed lights, so the parts of your images are burned, due to the inability of your camera to catch the top lights, as a passing white. the setting colors will generate some unusual results as they display the pointed lights in various rosatables.</seg>
<seg id="306">This is possible because blue pixels in general are not as fast-filled as green and red. & digikam; and dcraw therefore try to reconstruct the missing green and red portions from the still unsaturated blue pixels. of course, this is a question of how much color or white you want.</seg>
<seg id="307">If you select the option reconstructing, you get the possibility to set a level. here, a value of three is a compromise and / should therefore be adapted individually for each image.</seg>
<seg id="308">Set the luminance value according to your taste. you probably need to set it slightly higher than the standard 1. however, this can also later be done in the & digikam screen options; to keep the time for the Demosaicing small, you should proceed conservatively.</seg>
<seg id="309">A Demosaicing algorithm is a digital image process to calculate a complete picture of the raw data, which come from the color filtered image sensor, which has many cameras and which provides a matrix of coloured pixels. this algorithm is also known as CFA interpolation or colour design.</seg>
<seg id="310">And Dcraw provides you three alternatives: bilinear, VNG Interpolation and AHD Interpolation. after some tests, it looks like AHD Interpolation (for Adaptive Homogenic Directed) was the first algorithm used by Dcraw.</seg>
<seg id="311">If you know the color deviation of your lenses you can set the red and blue correction values here. this is certainly the best method for color correction since it is performed during the raw conversion.</seg>
<seg id="312">A profile translates the color information and gives instructions how to be given again. there are also LCMS and & digikam; information how to translate color information from a color space to the other, so that the colors are as accurate as possible.</seg>
<seg id="313">Behavior Questions when an image is opened in image editing / Color management module start with raw files.</seg>
<seg id="314">Color Profile Folder Sets the folder, such as / usr / share / color / ICC or / home / user / .color / ICC, where you can save all your profiles.</seg>
<seg id="315">Settings of ICC profiles you have here the option & quot; default resource; for your profiles to deposit. everything can be changed when opening the raw file later.</seg>
<seg id="316">The color management view is an alternative to Xcalib or Argyll. here are only your pictures colored not the entire screen.</seg>
<seg id="317">Not all profiles are created in the same way. there are some, such as Canon, which do not contain color-mapping or gamma correction. currently, dcraw Gamma does not correct for conversions at 16 bit depth. this means that you have to do the color mapping itself.</seg>
<seg id="318">There are other options such as the Soft Proof profile that you can emulate on how your image can be restored from one device. this is very useful before you print image, since your printer has a smaller color area than your camera and some colors can therefore be very saturated. this could be manually correct instead of relying on the blind algorithm of your printer.</seg>
<seg id="319">For most cameras, it is quite obvious which color profile is intended for what is intended for. unfortunately, not in the models of Canon. hence, here follows a table of cameras and profiles that fit together. this answer is of course unofficial:</seg>
<seg id="320">The Canon profile extension makes it possible to recognise the style for the goal: F for a precise style, L for landscapes, N for neutral, P for portrait and S for standard style.</seg>
<seg id="321">KIPI is the & kde; Image Plugin interface. it is an interface that is supported by a number of & kde; image viewers and image editing. by providing this interface can support & digikam; many modules that have been written to work with any program that supports the KIPI interface.</seg>
<seg id="322">If your distribution has the KIPI modules installed, you will see a list of available modules. select the modules you want to use, and these will be loaded by & Edit; these modules appear as new entries in the main window menu and in addition, you will find some also in the context menu of the preview.</seg>
<seg id="323">Shortcuts for tasks performed by modules can be set in the menu under Settings short commands.</seg>
<seg id="324">For more information (in English) about KIPI modules, please visit the KIPI project at http: / / www.kipi-plugins.org or in the manuals of the KIPI modules.</seg>
<seg id="325">The settings of the slide show should be easy to understand. the upper knob adjusts the time between the image transitions, usually 4-5 seconds. the other check boxes switch the metadata on or off, which are displayed at the bottom end of the images during the ad.</seg>
<seg id="326">The camera features on the left show a list of all the currently supported cameras. on the right hand side there is a button Automatic detection, which tries to identify a camera connected to the computer. if you want to use this, make sure that the camera is properly connected, switched on and in the image display mode. currently, serial, USB and USB / FireWire mass storage is supported.</seg>
<seg id="327">At the bottom, you can set the path for USB and FireWire (IEEE-1394 or i-Link) mass storage cameras. this field is only active if you have selected a USB or FireWire mass storage camera from the camera list. you must specify the path, / mnt / camera or / mnt / reovable, on which you mount your camera.</seg>
<seg id="328">To use your digital camera with & digicom; to use, you need to connect the camera to your computer, bring them to the display mode and turn on.</seg>
<seg id="329">Check out if & Edit; the camera automatically detects. if not, you can set camera model and port manually. after you set up your camera, your camera will appear in the camera menu.</seg>
<seg id="330">You can select any name for your camera. it will be displayed in the main window of the main window. if you have more than one camera, you can insert all of them here.</seg>
<seg id="331">With the option confirmation dialog for moving pictures in the folder, you can set the conversation by & digikam; you can set the photos in an album when deleting a photo. you will find more details in the deleting of a photo and deleting an album.</seg>
<seg id="332">The editorial changes due to the right sidebar can be used tacitly by & Edit; apply if you use the option to apply changes in the right sidebar without any queries. otherwise, you need to save the changes using the button changes.</seg>
<seg id="333">You can also disable the display of the welcome screen of & digikam; under certain circumstances, this speeds up the start process from & digikam;.</seg>
<seg id="334">The setting At start looking for new photos forced & digikam; choose the base folder for new or deleted albums / photos. this lengthens the start time of & digikam; if something has been deleted from the base folder, ask & Edit; you want it to delete it from the database.</seg>
<seg id="335">Different color schemes can be used in & Edit; to customize the main window to your taste. these settings can be selected in Settings Design from the Toolbar. a preview of the available designs will be listed below:</seg>
<seg id="336">These designs have been defined in plain text files. if you are interested in creating a new design for & digikam; to create, you will find more information about this in this tutorial.</seg>
<seg id="337">You can use these to view and edit your photos and to edit and improve. image editing can be started by clicking with the left mouse button on the preview of an image or by the context menu of preview and selection of entry / edit.</seg>
<seg id="338">Image editing includes a set of tools to improve your images. some of these are available as modules in & digikam; so you may not be part of your distribution. you can find more information about the KIPI modules in the image editing section.</seg>
<seg id="339">A status bar at the bottom of the window, the filename, current file number, magnification factor and the current image size.</seg>
<seg id="340">A menu bar on the top and below the toolbar for quick access to the most frequently needed functions.</seg>
<seg id="341">The editing functions of image editing change your photos. however, none of the functions will change the original photo before saving file Save or button Save from the toolbar. note that you can no longer restore the original photo once you have saved the image.</seg>
<seg id="342">You might need to make a copy of your image before you change it. this can be done with File Save as.</seg>
<seg id="343">As long as you have not saved the photo, you can restore the original image by recovering from the File menu or using the button Resize the image processing in the toolbar. you then lose any change you have done in the photo since last saving.</seg>
<seg id="344">Almost every action in image editing can be undone or restored. the last action can be reversed by editing or restoring Edit Resize from the menu.</seg>
<seg id="345">If you use this frequently, you should do the keyboard shortcut, Ctrl; -Z to undo and Ctrl; -Turn-Z to restore.</seg>
<seg id="346">If you press the & LMB; pressing the revert or restore button in the toolbar at a moment, you will get a context menu. if you select one of the menu entries, all actions in between will be reversed or restored.</seg>
<seg id="347">Once you have started editing, you can move between the photos in the same album or keyword by using the navigation buttons in the toolbar, image high, image down or the entries in the File menu. if you have made changes to the current photo, you will be asked if you want to save them.</seg>
<seg id="348">You can enter and zoom in the photo in which you use Ctrl; mouse wheel or the icons in the toolbar or the entries in the View menu.</seg>
<seg id="349">To customize a photo to the window size, you can use this button in the toolbar: select the magnification factor automatically</seg>
<seg id="350">View Full Screen mode displays the photo in full screen mode. you come into the normal view where you use the Esc key. normally, you can change this in the Edit Settings dialog. you can change it from the Edit & Create window; see the section to set up image editing.</seg>
<seg id="351">If you want to print the current picture, you can select the picture in the File menu and get the standard & kde; print dialog. you can customize the settings here before printing your photo.</seg>
<seg id="352">From the Main Menu, you can print single images or whole sets. whole picture templates can be printed from your selection. you only need to select the images using the standard methods and select Print Assistant from the Album Export menu. if you follow the wizard, you just need to make your choice.</seg>
<seg id="353">The main window has a sidebar on the right, which provides important information and actions for the selected images. the same page bar is available, without the navigation file, also in image editing. it is displayed when one of the five riders is clicked:</seg>
<seg id="354">Multiple clicking on the same tab causes the sidebar to appear or disappear again.</seg>
<seg id="355">The text is UTF-8 compatible. this means that all special characters are allowed. the labels are copied into the EXIF- and IPTC fields so that you can be used by other programs.</seg>
<seg id="356">The IPTC data only support ASCII characters and are limited to 2000 characters. all comments are truncated after 2000 characters and special characters are deformed. if you want to use the IPTC labelling field in other applications, you should consider these limitations.</seg>
<seg id="357">After you have commented it, use either the button Apply or simply switch to the next image, the captions are then saved.</seg>
<seg id="358">In addition to the application button, you can read more metadata from the selected file or the database. however, you can also write the metadata into the files. however, this is always performed when you have selected a metadata setting that is always written into the images.</seg>
<seg id="359">The review section shows a rating scheme from 0 to 5 stars and can be used in search and sort. it can be applied either with a single mouse click on the 5 stars in the sidebar or using the keyboard shortcut Ctrl + 0... 5. to evaluate multiple images simultaneously, select them and use the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="360">The rating is written in the IPTC field. the code follows the schema in the following table:</seg>
<seg id="361">The keyword list shows a search box for filtering the keywords, the keyword tree and a selection box with the keywords used previously in this & digicom; session.</seg>
<seg id="362">The keyword tree is dynamically adapted to the entered search word. thus, you can quickly restrict the number of options when searching for a keyword. this capability is particularly useful when you have a lot of keywords.</seg>
<seg id="363">The input field at the bottom is a further simplification when entering keywords in a picture series. if you have typed different keywords, they will be saved for quick access.</seg>
<seg id="364">Keywords can also be set by selecting the corresponding check boxes in the tree. all key words of an image are stored in the IPTC field keyword.</seg>
<seg id="365">If multiple images are selected in the main screen and you select a keyword in the keyword tree, this will only be applied to the highlighted image and not the entire selection, if you want to add a selection with a keyword, please read the keyword Filter section.</seg>
<seg id="366">The keyword Filter column is used to change the selection of images displayed in the main window. normally, the left side bar with their album, date, keyword and search views is used. if additionally one or more keyword filters are used from the right-hand side, only the intersection of these two is displayed. all generated keywords are available.</seg>
<seg id="367">You can also drag and drop keywords. suppose you have selected several images in the main view to add keywords. if the keyword already exists, you can simply drag it from the right sidebar and place it on the selection.</seg>
<seg id="368">In the example above, the main window displays the images on a calendar day. the keyword filter is set to No keywords, which reduces the amount to three images. they were selected with Ctrl + a, and then a keyword was drawn from the right keyword tree to the selection and stored there. a dialog asks whether this keyword is to be set.</seg>
<seg id="369">This search for changes takes place at every start of the program. it can also be switched off among Settings Various.</seg>
<seg id="370">If you have a rule with and created, and find that it would be one or more, you can easily change this by double-clicking on the text and in the rule area.</seg>
<seg id="371">(1): the entry in which the database is searched. this can be an album, name, keyword, image, keyword, etc.</seg>
<seg id="372">(3): the argument for the operator which is a name or string that is already set in the database.</seg>
<seg id="373">You can, for example, specify an extended search for all elements of the database with the following options:</seg>
<seg id="374">If you want to group options, you only need to use the check box at the end of the rule and then the button grouping. the options then look like this:</seg>
<seg id="375">Why were Picasaweb or Flickr not listed? the free disk space is limited to 1 GB and you won't want to save the images in full resolution.</seg>
<seg id="376">This article / tutorial was mainly written by Elle Stone. special thanks to Elle for this work. I mainly applied it to & digikam; s specific implementation.</seg>
<seg id="377">The reason why you use a color-managed workflow is that the colors that come from your camera or scanner will have a predictable deviation from the actually photographed or scanned colors. with a color-managed workflow, you can achieve that the colors on your monitor match those of your camera or scanner and that match the colors you print or publish on the web to those from your digital darkroom.</seg>
<seg id="378">When the theme comes to color management, everyone wants to know which buttons he has to press for the results he wants. unfortunately, color management means that you make informed decisions at every point of the image processing workflow. the purpose of this tutorial is to provide you with adequate background information about color management.</seg>
<seg id="379">If your image workflow satisfies all six criteria listed below, you don't have to worry about color management.</seg>
<seg id="380">You work on a monitor that is calibrated to the sRGB colour space. (see below for more information)</seg>
<seg id="381">Their only other image expenses are via e-mail or the web where sRGB is the de facto standard.</seg>
<seg id="382">So if sRGB works so well and makes life so easy for everyone, why should you use another color space and then have to think about color loss?</seg>
<seg id="383">A visual example of limitation of sRGB compared to the colors we can really see is presented below. it shows a 2-dimensional representation of all colors we can see, the horseshoe-shaped region, and the colors in sRGB color space, the triangular region.</seg>
<seg id="384">If you want to compare the 2-dimensional representation of sRGB with some bigger color spaces, visit Bruce Lindbloom's excellent site and click info and then on Information About RGB Working Spaces.</seg>
<seg id="385">Do I have to calliate my monitor when I decided to work only in sRGB color space?</seg>
<seg id="386">Yes! whether you work in sRGB colour space or not, you need to sound your monitor since sRGB is that your; onitor is on sRGB. if you work as a color space of sRGB then you must either sound your monitor on the sRGB standard, use a matching monitor profile or both.</seg>

<seg id="388">This tool provides five automatic corrections, which can improve a picture in most cases. therefore, before proceeding further manual editing, use it.</seg>
<seg id="389">The functions Normalize, Compare, Automatic Removes and Contrast extend from the correcting Auto Correction attempt automatically to make the best from your colors. you will have to experiment with these effects to see which works best in your photo.</seg>
<seg id="390">Normalize: this method scaling the brightness values over the entire image so that the darkest point is black and the brightest point is as bright as possible without changing its color shade. this function is often a magic correcting for images that are dark or out-washed.</seg>
<seg id="391">Balance: this method adjusts the intensity channel of the selected image so that the histogram of the intensity channel becomes as flat as possible. sometimes the comparison results in very good results with the improvement of the contrast of an image, sometimes it also produces rubbish. it is a very powerful operation that either causes miracles in an image or destroys it.</seg>
<seg id="392">Automatic balance: this method maximizes the colour range in the red, green and blue channel. it determines the dark and light border tones and adjusts the red, green and blue channels to the entire history of the history.</seg>
<seg id="393">Contrast enhancement: this method enhances the contrast and illuminance of the RGB values of an image by shifting the lowest and highest values to the greatest possible area and a re-jiushing of all values in-between. this is only visible with selected images and can be a good correction for bad photos.</seg>
<seg id="394">The white balance by & digikam; is a semi-automatic tool to perform the white balance of a photo.</seg>
<seg id="395">The white balance correction is slightly limited as you work with 8 bits per color. so if you are too far from the original image, areas with overexposure may occur. if you can perform the white balance in raw mode, which works in 16-bit mode, your possibilities for correction will be better.</seg>
<seg id="396">This tool is based on a white balance algorithm protected by Pawel T. Jochym. you start it via the menu entry color white balance of image processing.</seg>
<seg id="397">The preview window can be adjusted in size. on the left side you can see both the original image and preview of the target image. preview will dynamically adjust the settings of the tool. if you want to see the original white balance again, click on the subwindow.</seg>
<seg id="398">The preview of the target image has a red marker. the luminance of the pixel under this marker is displayed as a vertical line in the histogram.</seg>
<seg id="399">To the right, a histogram shows that dynamically changes as soon as you change a parameter. this histogram is very helpful, even in well lit images, most pixels have very small luminance values. with a button you can decide whether one of the three colors or your sum is displayed.</seg>
<seg id="400">The contrast of your result depends on shadow, saturation and gamma. shadow adjustment lets you improve or even dim the shadow details of your photos.</seg>
<seg id="401">To play Anstat with the above controls, you should use the color temperature pipette. click on this button and then somewhere on the image preview to use the selected color to calculate the color temperature of the white balance. this way also the temperature and green values are automatically set.</seg>
<seg id="402">In addition, you can set the white balance with the Preferences list. the following settings are available:</seg>
<seg id="403">The overexposure indicator increases the colors when more than one color channel of the pixel is overexposed. you will get the combined result in the white balance. this is displayed in the preview as a pure indicator and has no effect on the final image.</seg>
<seg id="404">The Save As and Load buttons make exactly this. any setting of the white balance you have set can be saved to a text file and reload later.</seg>
<seg id="405">The Preferences tab returns all filter values to their default values and neutral white balance. note that even neutral settings will result in a different picture than your original. if you save this, your original image will be changed.</seg>
<seg id="406">You can set the encoding depth per color channel of the edited image here. 8-bit encoding is the widely spread JPEG format, 16-bit encoding is better for high-quality images. however, this coding requires more disk space, computing time and is only available for formats PNG, PNM, TIFF and DNG.</seg>
<seg id="407">This tool opens the same dialog as for the processing of color profiles. it uses the change and assignment of color profiles. color-mapping can be done through the subwindow for the brightness. a detailed instruction for using color profiles can be used to consult the chapter color management.</seg>
<seg id="408">Another important tool is available in the color correction menu in the menu. this tool provides an integrated way to adjust several color channels simultaneously and also allows you to save your settings so that you can use them for several photos. this is useful when your camera or your scanner always make the same mistake and therefore always need the same correction.</seg>
<seg id="409">A very powerful way to correct exposure problems is the tool for gradation that you can find in color gradation in the menu.</seg>
<seg id="410">Die & digikam; tool colour effects will provide you with four colour effects, a solar power effect, a Velvia filter, a neon effect and a canister filter.</seg>
<seg id="411">In times of chemical processing, Solarisation, also called Sabatier, created an effect that was replaced by a partially developed print of a short flash light and then completed the development of the image. this had the effect that the lighter areas darker and the colors were inverted by the second illumination. this tool allows you to fine-adjust this interesting effect.</seg>
<seg id="412">The intensity controls the solar radiation. at approx. 50% intensity, the picture shows what is chemically possible. a further increase eventually creates a negative image that is not produced on photographic paper.</seg>
<seg id="413">This is an example of the solar process effect. the original image is the (1) and that processes the (2). the applied intensity is 30%.</seg>
<seg id="414">The Vivid filter simulates the so called & quot; Velviaquot; effect. it differs from a saturation by making it a stronger contrast effect that makes the colors brilliant and glowing.</seg>
<seg id="415">Velvia is the brand name for an inverse colour film produced by the Japanese company Fujifilm. the name is a composition of & quot; Velvet Mediaquot; and thus a reference for its smooth image structure. Velvia offers very saturated color in daylight and high contrasts. the characteristics make him the film of choice for nature photographers. Velvia's strongly saturated colors, however, are also a lot of photographers, especially those who hardly need landscapes.</seg>
<seg id="416">The Neon filter simulates neon light on the contrast edges. the parameter level controls the brightness of the result and the slide repeats the thickness of the neon light. for large images the filter can load the entire CPU for a moment.</seg>
<seg id="417">Digital cameras often have problems with light conditions and it is therefore not unusual that you want to correct the color contrast and brightness of the photo. you can try to experiment the different color aspects of your photo with the tools in the menu under colors. once you are satisfied with the result, use the Ok button and you will be applied.</seg>
<seg id="418">If you make a photo in poor light conditions you can get the reverse problem: a too big saturation. also in this case, the tool for brightness and saturation is a good choice to reduce saturation rather than increase it. if you like the result you can confirm the changes with Ok.</seg>
<seg id="419">Between the complex tool gradation and simple denial / contrast / gamma, the tool tone correction is based on the improvement of exposure. even if the dialogue to this tool works very complicated, you need only the range of the slide for the purpose described here. more concrete the three sliders below the histogram.</seg>
<seg id="420">The window contains a graph of intensity values, a histogram, the active channel or the selected area. under the graph, three slide are clicked into them and they can be moved to change the intensity values of the image. the left side represents the dark and the right side the bright areas.</seg>
<seg id="421">The easiest way to learn how to use it is to postpone the controller and take care of how the image changes.</seg>
<seg id="422">On the right, the original and preview of the image can be viewed. preview will be updated dynamically, based on the settings of the image. the following options are available on the left-hand side.</seg>
<seg id="423">Scaling: this selection box shows whether the histogram is displayed with a linear or logarithmic Y axis. for images of a digital camera, linear representation is often the most useful. in pictures, the linear histogram is dominated by a single column. in this case the logarithmic classification is more useful.</seg>
<seg id="424">Three controllers: the top for the dark sounds, the middle one for the bright tones and the lowest for the middle sounds, often called gamma-values.</seg>
<seg id="425">The three color pinpettes can be used in the preview of the original image to automatically adjust the input values of the shadows, middle and light tones. in addition, there is a button for fully automatic adjustment.</seg>
<seg id="426">Output values: the output values allow the selection of manual values for each area. there are also two controls that can be used to interactively change the output values as in the input values. the compression of the output values can be used e.g. to create a faded image as background while something else is seen in the foreground.</seg>
<seg id="427">Automatically: with this button, the image values are automatically set depending on the intensity values of the image.</seg>
<seg id="428">Save as and load: with these buttons, the set values can be saved in the file system and loaded later. for this purpose the Gimp level format is used.</seg>
<seg id="429">If you use this mode and the three color pipettes, the input values are automatically readjusted for all shadows, means and sun tones. activate the color pipette you want to use and click the preview of the original image to set the input values of the histogram for red, green, blue and the luminance channels.</seg>
<seg id="430">The Overexposure indicator checks all color channels to find overexposed pixels and show you the combined result of all channels. this is an indicator, i.e. you will get the effect only in the preview and it's no effect on the final result.</seg>
<seg id="431">Below you see an example of adjusting the input values applied to the red, green and blue channel of a photo. intensity and alpha channel, as well as the output values are unchanged. the original image is marked with (1) and the corrected image with (2).</seg>
<seg id="432">The left side shows half of the original and the target image. preview is dynamically updated depending on your settings. the following options are available on the right-hand side:</seg>
<seg id="433">Modifier channel: this selection box allows to specify the channel that is modified by the module:</seg>
<seg id="434">Next to this box are two symbols to switch between a linear and a logarithmic view. for pictures taken with a digital camera, the linear mode is usually the most useful. for images with large areas of a constant color, linear mode creates a wide beam. in this case, the logarithmic mode will help.</seg>
<seg id="435">For example, if you move a short part to the right, e.g. the bright tones, then you can see that these bright tones correspond to darker output tones and that the associated image pixels become darker.</seg>
<seg id="436">If you want to move this marker to the area you want to change, a matching line is displayed on the curve representing the original value. create a point on this line and then move it up and down until the value is adjusted to your taste.</seg>
<seg id="437">Save as and load: with these buttons, you can do exactly this. every curve you have created can be saved in the file system and loaded later. the file format for this is the Gimp curve format.</seg>
<seg id="438">If you create this method and the three color pipette buttons automatically create the control points of the curve for all channels of shadow, middle and sun tones. activate the color pipette you want to use and click the original image to set the control points for the red, green, blue and luminance curve.</seg>
<seg id="439">The Overexposure indicator checks all color channels to display over exposed pixels. if in more than one channel exposed pixels are found, you get the combined result. this is an indicator, i.e. you will get the effect only in the preview and it's no effect on the final result.</seg>
<seg id="440">Below you can see a black and white photo, which was corrected in the luminance channel. shadow and sun tones were set with the color pipette and applied to the curves. the original image is (1) and the corrected (2).</seg>
<seg id="441">The channel mixer der & digikam; image processing is a tool for improving the color channels or changing the color shades of the photo.</seg>
<seg id="442">The channel mixer is another highly developed tool to mix the colors of the images. you can edit it from the menu colors channel mixer of image processing.</seg>
<seg id="443">With the channel selection box, you can select the color for the histogram: this gives you a first hint as you can correct the channels by viewing the relative distribution and precipitation. the left pane of the window will show you a preview. the original can be viewed for comparison with your own rider.</seg>
<seg id="444">The preview of the target image has a red marker. if you position it in the image appears a vertical line in the histogram to show you the corresponding color value.</seg>
<seg id="445">Controls for the module are shown on the right: controls for red, green and construction allow you to mix these channels. if you activate Luminance, the image will retain the general brightness even if you change the option Monochrome, since the channel mixer is then THE tool for creating great black and white conversions of your photos. try to reduce the green channel for black and white portraits.</seg>
<seg id="446">Sometimes, especially when you mix monochrome, the reduction of a color leads to a visible noise that comes from the colored noise. the color is made of small noise artefacts that do not appear at the same place in the color channel and whose noise pattern is different in each channel. if that is the case, you can improve your monochrome conversion thereby reducing the color noise first.</seg>
<seg id="447">The Save As and Load buttons are used exactly for this purpose. you can save any mixer setting for later and then load it. the file format used is the Gimp channel mixer format.</seg>
<seg id="448">The Overexposure indicator checks all color channels to find overexposed pixels and show you the combined result of all channels. this is an indicator, i.e. you will get the effect only in the preview and it's no effect on the final result.</seg>
<seg id="449">Below you can see a photo in which the blue channel has been readjusted. the option Luminance is enabled. the original image is under (1) and the edited image below (2).</seg>
<seg id="450">Black / white photography has always been fascinating because of your abstraction. with the development of digital photography, black / white is a work step because color images can be easily converted to the computer. also with a set of film roll profiles.</seg>
<seg id="451">Ilford Delta 100, Ilford Delta 400, Ilford Delta 400 Pro 3200, Ilford FP4 Plus, Ilford HP5 Plus, Ilford PanF Plus, Ilford XP2 Super</seg>
<seg id="452">Green filter: simulates a black / white film exposure with a green lentil filter. this looks good at all scene images and fits particularly well to portraits of the sky.</seg>
<seg id="453">Orange Filter: simulates a black / white film exposure with a orange line filter. this improves landscapes, maritime scenes and aerial photos.</seg>
<seg id="454">Red filter: simulates a black / white film exposure with a red lens filter. this creates dramatic celestial effects and can simulate lunar eens at the time of the day. thus, similar to the 003 Cokin (tm) red filter.</seg>
<seg id="455">Yellow filter: simulates a black / white film exposure with a yellow lens filter. this is the most natural colour tone correction and improves the contrast. it is ideal for landscapes and thus similar to the 001 Cokin (tm) yellow filter.</seg>
<seg id="456">Scapaton: creates warm light and medium tones while adding a bit of cold in the shading tones. this is very similar to the process of the bleaching of a pressure and the redevelopment in a scepiatoner. this is typical for the photos of your grandmother and thus similar to the 005 Cokin (tm) scepiafilter.</seg>
<seg id="457">With the & digikam; apply tool texture you can apply decorative textures to an image.</seg>
<seg id="458">By adding a texture to your image, regardless of whether it is a color image or not, you can make it look like an oil painting on a screen, the stitch of an old master, a pop art portrait of enlarged points or like a mural on a wall.</seg>
<seg id="459">Relief: postpone this parameter to the right increases the appearance of the depth respectively the three-dimensionality of the texture on the image.</seg>
<seg id="460">A paper text effect was applied on the photo below. the original image is (1) and the modified one below (2). the relief parameter has been set to 200.</seg>
<seg id="461">With the & digikam; tool frame add a decorative frame to be added to a picture.</seg>
<seg id="462">Keeping the eye of a viewer within the limits of a photo is not an easy task. one way to keep his attention is to put the image a decorative frame. this is a psychological barrier to the scattering eye.</seg>
<seg id="463">Type: with this parameter you can set the desired frame type for your image. thoroughly, the image borders with a colored line, Niepce surround it with a thin line and a wide frame (ideal for black and white pictures), bekantet it with a nice three dimensional frame which is ideal for a button effect and decorative adds a decorative frame with patterns.</seg>
<seg id="464">Width: specifies the width of the frame in percent. the range of values for width is limited from 1% to 50%.</seg>
<seg id="465">The finish decorated with the frame will be bigger than the original, but the same aspect ratio. this is important for printing the images, especially if you have used the tool after aspect ratio before using.</seg>
<seg id="466">With this handy tool, you can easily insert a formatted text into a picture at any place. this also goes to several places if you need it.</seg>
<seg id="467">This tool is very intuitive to use. simply enter the text and place it with the mouse. use text direction, orientation, color from the color space and the character set with its properties as you need it. you will simply select a frame around the text and / or a semi-transparent background.</seg>
<seg id="468">Any setting you have chosen for your text can be changed until you press the OK button. once the image has been saved, the text is part of the image. it can no longer be changed.</seg>
<seg id="469">With the & digikam; tool templates apply you can place a template on a picture.</seg>
<seg id="470">The Create menu template can be used in image processing can be used to place templates over a picture.</seg>
<seg id="471">For the stencil there are no restrictions regarding the size and orientation. however, you need to take the PNG file format and should work with maximum compression (9) for the reduction of the file size of the template. if you want to add your template to the & digicom; mailinglist digiplug-users @ kde.org..</seg>
<seg id="472">If you use this tool for the first time, you need to set your template folder to the base folder in the dialog. select the folder where you copied the template files. these settings will be scheduled for the next start.</seg>
<seg id="473">After the root folder has been set for the templates, a tree view that reflects the folder structure of the template folder appears. selecting a folder automatically updates the template's thumbnail.</seg>
<seg id="474">There are three buttons below that you can change the magnification factor and the position of your image.</seg>
<seg id="475">Enlarge: this button magnifies the underlying image. it is centered around the position of the mouse. check it with the left mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="476">Resize: this button shrinks the image below. it is centered around the position of the mouse. if you want to apply the template to the whole picture, you need to reduce the image accordingly. check it with the left mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="477">Move: use this button to move the image lying under the template. to do so, take the picture and place it at the desired position.</seg>
<seg id="478">Use OK when you want to apply the template to your image. the image will then be adjusted automatically to the preview size.</seg>
<seg id="479">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "there are three different tools for sharpening. each one of you has advantages in other fields." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="480">Sharpening is a traditional tool for sharpening. it is very fast and easy, but creates grainy images especially in dark areas.</seg>
<seg id="481">Blurring mask works on the contrast of edges to make a picture sharper. in fact it does not sharpen a bit, it works rather psychovisual. you can use it to remove atmospheric haze and it makes a really good job. the algorithm has been taken out of Gimp and it is copyrighted by Winston Chang.</seg>
<seg id="482">Refocusing is possibly the best of the three because it really improves the sharpness. it is a little more complicated in its application and has different parameters for adjustment.</seg>
<seg id="483">Images without focus as well as most digitized images need a correction of the sharpness. this is because the digitization process can be combined with only minimal differences at a color point. this in turn leads to sharp edges a little blurred. the same phenomenon can be observed when color points are printed on paper. SLR cameras usually require more subsequently sharpening than normal cameras for private users.</seg>
<seg id="484">Images in raw format, on the other hand, must always be sharpened during processing.</seg>
<seg id="485">Some scanners apply a field of sharpness already during the reading of the image. if you deactivate this, you will get control of your image.</seg>
<seg id="486">In some situations, you can get useful results by sharpening a photo with the sharpening tool. this allows you to use the menu entry corrector sharpening.</seg>
<seg id="487">You should be careful with this because the results do not work very naturally: sharpening increases the sharpness of the edges, but also increases the noise. in general, the most useful technique for sharpening an image will refocus the tool. you will achieve more information and a comparison of all techniques for sharpening.</seg>
<seg id="488">Sometimes you have the opposite problem: a picture is too cracked. the solution to draw the picture a little soft is much easier than to sharpen it. use the tool for softening with the menu entry Correcting softness and experiment something with settings. the preview window on the right of the dialog will show you the effect on your photo.</seg>
<seg id="489">The filter Unsharp masking is a very good tool for removing veil from your photos. you can see a demonstration here.</seg>
<seg id="490">The original image and preview help to edit the image. the preview window displays the output of the filter with the current settings.</seg>
<seg id="491">There are two important parameters, the radius and the amount. the default values often generate good results and should be tried first. increasing the radius or the amount increases the effect.</seg>
<seg id="492">The radius indicates how many pixels on each side of an edge are affected by the filter. high-resolution images allow larger radii. therefore, you should best sharpen images in their final resolution.</seg>
<seg id="493">The amount represents the percentage between the original and the wiped image which is added to the original. thus, the strength of the sharpness is set.</seg>
<seg id="494">The threshold value is a fraction of the maximum RGB value and the application difference amount. thus, it is possible to define a minimum difference thus for an edge of the filter. thus areas with a soft alternation between the tones are excluded from sharpening and therefore flaws in faces, skies and water surfaces are avoided.</seg>
<seg id="495">This is an example of the blurred mask filter. the original image is the (1) and the edited image the (2). blurred mask was applied with radius = 6.0, amount = 0.5 and a threshold value = 0.0.</seg>
<seg id="496">Die & digikam; tool refocus redirects a picture by improving the sharpness. it used the copyright protected design filter algorithm by Ernst Lippe.</seg>
<seg id="497">This is a better approach than just trying to sharpen the photo. it uses a technique called FIR Wiener filtering. the traditional technique for sharpening images is the use of a blurring mask. refocusing reaches usually better results than blurred. you can start it from the menu by calling color refocussing in image processing.</seg>
<seg id="498">In practice, the circular folding works much better than the gauze 'cal folding. the Gauß's folding has a very long tail, which results in the mathematical result also from the source pixelae that are far from the original source pixel. in most cases, the FIR Wiener Inverse of the Gauß' folding is even very strongly influenced by the remote pixels.</seg>
<seg id="499">Circular focus: this is the radius of the circular folding. it is the most important parameter for using this module. for most pictures, the default value should result in 1 good results.</seg>
<seg id="500">Correlation: an increase in correlation can help to reduce artefacts. the correlation can be selected from 0-1. useful values are 0.5 and the values near 1, & eg; 0,95 and 0.99. a high value for the correlation reduces the sharpness effect of the module.</seg>
<seg id="501">Noise filter: an increase in the noise filter can help reduce artifacts. however, values higher than 0.1 are rarely useful. if the noise filter is too low, eg; 0 the image quality is very bad. a useful value is 0,03. a high value will continue to smear the picture.</seg>
<seg id="502">Gauss'sche sharpness: this is the radius for the sharpest sharpness. use this parameter if your blur is gauze. this is most often caused by a previously executed blur filter. in most cases, you should use this value to 0 to avoid annoying artifacts. if you use a value equal to zero, you may also need to increase the correlation and / or the noise filter.</seg>
<seg id="503">Matrix size: this value determines the size of the matrix. an increase in the size of the die can produce good results especially if you choose large values for the sharpness or sharpness of the palate. however, please note that the module will be very slow if you select large values for this parameter. in most cases, you should choose a value in the range of 3-10.</seg>
<seg id="504">The Save As and Load buttons are used exactly for this purpose. any refocusing parameter you have set will be saved for later and can then be loaded.</seg>
<seg id="505">Try to perform all cutting, color and intensity corrections on the image before using the module.</seg>
<seg id="506">Otherwise you should use the module before you change the image otherwise. the reason for this is that a lot of operations changes that are not immediately visible, but later leave unpleasant artefacts.</seg>
<seg id="507">When you read and compress images, eg; as JPEG, you should apply the module to the uncompressed image.</seg>
<seg id="508">Generally, unsharp masking produces better results than sharpening. this could be caused by the unsharp masking of a larger neighborhood used than sharpening.</seg>
<seg id="509">In theory, unsharp masks always need to produce artefacts. even under optimal conditions it can never be the effect of the blur. for the Wiener filter it is possible to show that it is the optimal lens filter. the FIR Wiener filter is often better in processing small details.</seg>
<seg id="510">Below you can see a comparison between the different filters using a small unfocused image:</seg>
<seg id="511">This picture has been made with an analog camera. the unfocused result is due to insufficient light for the auto focus lens.</seg>
<seg id="512">For more information on the methods of sharpness correction in digital pictures, you can read a technical comparison in English at this address.</seg>
<seg id="513">The smoothness regulator puts the blur of the area that has been darkened to create a more natural pupil.</seg>
<seg id="514">The ink ink allows for a customized color for the pupil. if you want blue eyes instead of dark ones, you can set it here.</seg>
<seg id="515">The tool error correction tool is one of the most developed tools to remove undesired artifacts with unprecedented speed.</seg>
<seg id="516">The Inpainting algorithm was developed by the IMAGE team of the GREC CNRS laboratory in Caen / France and is part of the CImg project.</seg>
<seg id="517">This tool contains different presets as starting points to simplify the restoration process. the available default settings are listed below:</seg>
<seg id="518">If you want to fine-tune the filter settings, you can use the Rifles and Advanced Settings tabs.</seg>
<seg id="519">Details p [0, 100]: this controls the maintenance of the details. a small value leads to an even smoothness over the image. a value of 0.9 should be kept in detail in such a way that no sharpening is necessary subsequently.</seg>
<seg id="520">Directional dependence of Alpha [0,100]: a small value smoothes evenly in all directions, while a value close to 1 smoothes only in one direction. if you have a film grain or CCD noise will produce a high value shaft-like pattern. JPEG Artefacts are best removed at a value near 1.</seg>
<seg id="521">Smooth [0, 500]: this sets the maximum smoothing effect via all. p then defines the relative smoothing. therefore, set this value appropriate to the degree of noise in your image.</seg>
<seg id="522">Regularity: [0, 100]: this parameter affects larger structures. the higher this value is set, the more is smoothed. this is necessary if there is a lot of noise as it is then difficult to estimate the geometry of the image. even if you want to create a 'van Gogh' turbulence effect it must be set higher than 3.</seg>
<seg id="523">Repetitions: specifies how often the algorithm passes through. usually 1 or 2 is sufficient.</seg>
<seg id="524">Angle of angle da [5, 90]: angle-dependent integration of the anisotropic Alpha. if alpha is selected small, it should also be small. make sure that small angles create a long term. so you should choose this value as much as possible and acceptable for your needs.</seg>
<seg id="525">Integral step width [0,1, 10]: integral step width in pixels. you should set the value smaller 1 to avoid sub-pixel smoothing and never exceed 2.</seg>
<seg id="526">Use linear interpolation: the more quality you receive by selecting this option is minimal, but it doubles the runtime. we therefore recommend it to omit it.</seg>
<seg id="527">The Save As and Load buttons make exactly this. any setting of image errors can be corrected in a text file and loaded later.</seg>
<seg id="528">Correcting image errors is comparatively very fast when working. nevertheless, it can take a long time and pull a high CPU load. you can therefore cancel the calculation at any time using the Cancel button.</seg>
<seg id="529">Below you can see how image errors are corrected with small artefacts. the module is applied on a photo that was made in Guatemala City with an analog camera. as you can see, there is a strange black artefact in the foreground that caused by a bad movie storage during the trip. the original picture is below (1) and the corrected picture below (2).</seg>
<seg id="530">Die & digikam; noise reduction is a powerful tool to reduce noise. it uses a copyrighted algorithm by Peter Heckert.</seg>
<seg id="531">This tool provides selectable image filters to remove stains and other artefacts that come from dust or hair on the lens. it can also be used to remove sensor noise from the camera or Moireacute; effects of scanned images from books or magazines.</seg>
<seg id="532">If you need more information about digital cameras sensor noise, you can read them in English in this tutorial.</seg>
<seg id="533">The screenshot above shows a typical scene made with a digital camera and a high ISO sensitivity. it shows a grainy noise that can be successfully removed with this tool.</seg>
<seg id="534">In the following you will find a complete description of all parameters. in most cases, you only need the sub-window details and the Advanced Settings subwindow can remain with the default settings.</seg>
<seg id="535">Radius controls the window size, from 1 (3x3) to 20 (41x41) used for the filter. large values increase the time the filter per pixel needs and can blurred the image. the area indicated by the radius is smoothed over the image and the color in it is smoothed and smaller errors are adjusted.</seg>
<seg id="536">Sharpness: controls the sharpness of the sharpness. this value sets the pixel distance the filter looks forward to determine luminance changes. if the value is too high, the adaptive filter image details can no longer be obtained and noise or smearing occurs again.</seg>
<seg id="537">Edges: controls the edge accuracy for the sharpness. this value improves the frequency response of the filter. if it is too strong, the whole noise can not be removed or noise peaks can occur. put it to a value close to the maximum if you want to remove a weak noise or JPEG-artefacts without losing details.</seg>
<seg id="538">Luminance: controls the luminance tolerance of the image. we recommend either color or luminance to change to improve a picture. these settings do not affect the smoothing process that is controlled by the details settings.</seg>
<seg id="539">Color: controls the color tolerance of the image. we recommend either color or luminance to change to improve a picture. these settings do not affect the smoothing process that is controlled by the details settings.</seg>
<seg id="540">Gamma: controls the gamut tolerance of the image. this value can be used to increase the tolerance values of the darker areas, which are typically stronger, however, it also greases the shadow areas.</seg>
<seg id="541">Damping: controls the adjustment of phase jitter damping. this value defines how quickly the adaptive filter radius responds to variations in the luminance density. when it is raised, the edges appear smoother when it is too high, noise and phase jitter appear at the edges.</seg>
<seg id="542">Store under and load: these buttons are used exactly for this purpose. all parameters for noise reduction you have set can be stored in the file system and loaded later.</seg>
<seg id="543">This is an example of how noise reduction can change your life. the original image is marked with (1) and the corrected mit (2).</seg>
<seg id="544">Sometimes a picture is too cracked for your purpose. the solution to draw the picture a little soft is fortunately much easier than sharpening a picture. use the soft sign with the menu entry Correct softness and experiment with the smoothness. the preview window on the right side of the dialog displays the effect of this operation on your photo.</seg>
<seg id="545">Die & digikam; photo restoration is definitely one of the most advanced tools to reduce photo artefacts.</seg>
<seg id="546">This filter for restoration gives you the possibility to remove a lot of unwanted artifacts from your pictures. it is very well adapted to remove Gauß's noise, film grain, scratches, compression artefacts and local errors that occur in digital, original or subsequently digitalized pictures.</seg>
<seg id="547">The same algorithm can be used for color and texture replacements. the texture composition is performed using a different tool, the image error correction. the restoration algorithm has been developed by the IMAGE team of the GREC CNRS laboratory in Caen / Frannkreich and is part of the CImg project.</seg>
<seg id="548">JPEG Artefacts reduce: the compression of JPEG is not perfect, in some areas even very far from it. as a loss-prone compression algorithm he generates some compression & quot; Artefaktequot; - small standards that can be seen in uncompressed image. this setting should correct these problems.</seg>
<seg id="549">The Save As and Load buttons make exactly this. any setting of photo restoration can be saved in a text file and loaded later.</seg>
<seg id="550">Photo restoration is comparatively very fast during work. nevertheless, it can take a long time and pull a high CPU load. you can therefore cancel the calculation at any time with the exit button.</seg>
<seg id="551">The module is applied to a black and white photo that has been recorded with a Minolta (tm) 700Si camera to an Ilford (tm) HP-5 movie with sensitivity of 3200 ISO. you can see the notorious film grain on the faces.</seg>
<seg id="552">Below you can see another example of photo restoration. this time textures were applied to an old color photo, which was read with a scanner. you can see the scan artefacts caused by scanner lighting and photo paper. the original image is below (1) and the corrected image below (2).</seg>
<seg id="553">Die & digikam; tool Hotpixel allows hot pixels of photos taken with a CCD camera gem, eight were removed. it uses algorithms from the JPEGPixi project protected by Martin Dickopp.</seg>
<seg id="554">Bright, dead or hot pixels are a problem especially in high-quality raw-mode photos as many cameras with JPEG compression have a built-in suppression for hot pixels.</seg>
<seg id="555">This tool can be used to remove & quot; hot pixels; and "quot; bright PixelClear; on a photo with a dark photo subtraction method. there is currently no manual method to select the bad pixels.</seg>
<seg id="556">Download this file in the wizard with the button dark. the tool will automatically detect the hot and bright pixels. these are highlighted in the image preview.</seg>
<seg id="557">If you have an old digital camera it is important that you record the dark image directly in order to detect new hot or bright pixels by CCD defects.</seg>
<seg id="558">First, as described in the previous section, you should load the appropriate dark image to the image to be corrected. an automatic processing of the dark image will find the bad pixels.</seg>
<seg id="559">The image area and preview will help you correct the result within the image. the preview window displays the output of the filter with the current settings. bad pixels are raised in all preview areas.</seg>
<seg id="560">Select an area to view the defective pixels on the preview and the results of the filter. then select the best filter method to interpolate these pixels blocks. these are the filters available:</seg>
<seg id="561">Average: an average of the neighbor pixels is determined. the resulting color is assigned to all faulty pixels in the block. for a 1-dimensional interpolation this is done separately for the horizontal and vertical line.</seg>
<seg id="562">Linear: all pixels that have a distance of 1 from the pixel block are drawn up to compute a bi-linear surface (2 dim) or a group of linear curves (1 dim). these are then used to interpolate the defective pixel in the block.</seg>
<seg id="563">Square: this is the default filter method. all pixels with a distance of 2 or less to the pixel block are drawn up to compute a bi-square surface (2 dim) or a group of square curves (1 dim) that is then used to interpolate the pixels in the block.</seg>
<seg id="564">Cubic: all pixels with a distance of 3 or less are drawn to compute a bi-cubic surface (2 dim) or a group of cubic curves (1 dim) that is then used to interpolate the defective pixel in the block.</seg>
<seg id="565">Below you can see the Hotpixel correction on a color photo, from a defective digital camera with a sensitivity of 200 ISO and long exposure, applied. the original image has been enlarged to 300% (1) and the corrected image is below (2).</seg>
<seg id="566">Die & digikam; Vignetting correction is a tool to correct the vignetting, i.e. underexposed corners, of an image.</seg>
<seg id="567">Wide angle lenses, especially those in medium and large photo format, can often not illuminate the entire sensor area evenly. instead & quot; vignetting-quot; (shaded) they reduce the edges and edges of the image by reducing the light that reaches the sensor there. telephoto lenses may also show this behavior.</seg>
<seg id="568">Many center filters require a factor of 1.5 or 2 in the aperture filter, which increases the necessary shutter speed in such a way that it is impossible to hold the camera by hand. wide angle lenses should also be used with center filters, an aperture of f / 16 or smaller, since otherwise the blurring effects are caused by movement.</seg>
<seg id="569">With the large exposure ranges of today's film and grayscale depth of digital cameras and film scanners, it is possible to simulate the effect of a Centerfilter by applying an equivalent transformation on a raw image that has been made without this filter. the tool Vignetting correcting turns the transformation with a Centerfilter on a picture. the algorithm is protected by John Walker.</seg>
<seg id="570">With three regulators you can control the vignetting correction filter and with three further the exposure of the target image.</seg>
<seg id="571">Density: this parameter controls the degree of light intensity damping at the point of the largest density of the filter. the standard density is 2.0, which compensates for an optical filter with an aperture setting of 1, or accidentally a luminous intensity of 2. increase the density to compensate for a greater degree of vignetting, reduce it by a small degree.</seg>
<seg id="572">Luminous intensity, contrast and gamma settings: editing an image with the vignetting correction reduces the brightness of the pixels. you need to readjust the exposure of the target image with these options. the controls only provide you with positive values, since you only need to increase the settings.</seg>
<seg id="573">If you want a finer re-adjustment of the exposure of the target image, leave the values for brightness / contrast / gamma at zero and use the gradation from the Edit & digikam; image processing from the color gradation menu.</seg>
<seg id="574">This is an example of the vignetting correction on an image applied. the original image (1) shows the vignetting in the corners and (2) the corrected image.</seg>
<seg id="575">Die & digikam; lens distortion is a tool to correct the impact of spherical lenses on photos. it uses a copyrighted algorithm by David Hodson.</seg>
<seg id="576">This tool works with geometric distortions. coloured distortions cannot be corrected with this tool.</seg>
<seg id="577">The coefficient of the second degree covers the general geometrical distortion of the lens and can correct the concave or convex shape of the image.</seg>
<seg id="578">The coefficient of the third grade has a similar rounded effect, but flattens the edges. this correction is not applied in the tool.</seg>
<seg id="579">The coefficient of fourth grades corrects the remote corners to that of the second grade. if you combine these two, any geometric distortions can be almost eliminated.</seg>
<seg id="580">In general: this value controls the thickness of distortion second degree. with negative values, tonal distortions can be corrected and positive cushion distortion.</seg>
<seg id="581">Corner: this value controls the thickness of the distortion fourth grade. this value is stronger at the edges than in the middle of the image. for most lenses the 'Corner Parameters' has the inverted default character of the parameter.</seg>
<seg id="582">Zoom: this value re-scaled the image size and results in a correction of the first degree. negative values increase while positive image size decreases.</seg>
<seg id="583">Lightening: this value adjusts the brightness in the corners of the image. negative values decrease the brightness of the image in the corners while positive values increase them.</seg>
<seg id="584">To help you find the best filter settings, the dialog with a preview illustrates the distortion correction. the values you use for your image will be saved and used as default values at the next start.</seg>
<seg id="585">The toning or kissing correction should be performed before all trimming or resizing changes. it is best to perform this correction as the first. if you re-cut an image and then perform a tonical correction, the effect would apparently be the wrong.</seg>
<seg id="586">To help you find the best correction, this tool provides you with a vertical and horizontal support line. move the mouse pointer in the image preview to view the dotted lines. move it to an important place, such as the sea edge or a wall, in your image and press the left mouse button to fix the lines at this point. afterwards, you can correct the sound / cushion distortion with the help of the lines.</seg>
<seg id="587">If you correct a cushion distortion, the resulting image will have black corners. you can remove them using the cutting tool in the Transformers menu from image processing or via the Zoom regulator in this dialog.</seg>
<seg id="588">The next logical step for some motifs such as photos from the front, frame and paintings is to correct the perspective in such a way that all angles in the picture have 90 degrees. note that when you hold the camera with your hand you will always have a slight distortion of the perspective.</seg>
<seg id="589">This is an example of the tonical correction applied to a church in Norway. the original image is below (1) and the corrected image below (2).</seg>
<seg id="590">The algorithm is based on a method for simulating infra-red film of the Gimpanzu.org website which can be accessed under this URL. the filter reproduces the well-known SFX200 Iinfrarotfilm, see this URL. this film has a sensitivity range of 200-800 ISO.</seg>
<seg id="591">In the left side of the window, you can select the area for preview. if you move the red rectangle with the mouse you can view the effect on different parts of the image.</seg>
<seg id="592">Below the preview you can set two parameters to set film grain and film sensitivity (ISO). activate the option Add film grain if you want to simulate the gradient texture of a highly sensitive film. the ISO control changes the amount of film grain and the dominance of green (chlorophyll in nature) in transformation. green meadows are white like snow!</seg>
<seg id="593">Since the filter mixes color channels to reproduce infra-red film, especially the green channel makes no sense to apply the effect on black / white photos as the colour information is missing.</seg>
<seg id="594">This is an example of the infrared filter effect applied to a landscape photograph from New Zealand. the original image is below (1) and the edited image below (2). the sensitivity of the film was set to ISO 400. higher ISO values create a kind of aura in the top lights.</seg>
<seg id="595">Die & digikam; filter movie granulation is an easy-to-use tool to reproduce film grain on your images. this is known from classic high-speed films such as the B / W Kodak Tri-X. in order to increase the sensitivity of the films the manufacturers mix large silver particles of the photographic emulsion.</seg>
<seg id="596">The film grain effect gives your photo a certain mood or seems to shift back into the past. the treated picture gets rid of a timeless ambiance from everyday life. if you want to use this special, gallery-like, road-photographic, grainy view especially in your monochrome photos, you have to use this filter.</seg>
<seg id="597">With the controller, the ISO sensitivity can be calibrated to control the intensity and granularity of the grains. the default value is, although often higher values are required, to ISO-2400. if you need more grains, you can apply the filter several times.</seg>
<seg id="598">This is an example of the film grain effect applied to a black / white picture. the original image is the (1) and the used film sensitivity corresponds to ISO-1600.</seg>
<seg id="599">Die & digikam; Filter oil painting creates the appearance of an oil painting. it uses a copyright protected algorithm by Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="600">Die & digikam; Filter oil paintings give your digital pictures a nice appearance like an oil painting. natural images and still life are good for this effect.</seg>
<seg id="601">There are two controls to influence this effect. the upper one selects the brush size between one and five. thicker brush are better for large images. smooth the smoothness or, from the other side, the hinges.</seg>
<seg id="602">This is an example of the oil painting effect. the original image is marked with the (1) and the editing is marked with (2). brush size for this 640 pixel large picture is 1 and Glätte 17.</seg>
<seg id="603">Die & digikam; Filter charcoal drawing uses color and intensity gradients to create a coal sketch. images whose gradients are slowly changing are therefore not ideal for this effect. it is helpful if you imagine which scene you would have chosen to sketch you. these would be good pictures to start with.</seg>
<seg id="604">There are two controls with a value range from 1 to 100 to control this effect. the upper knob selects the pin size and the lower adjusts the contrast (smoothness).</seg>
<seg id="605">This is an example of the carbon capture filter. the original image (1) and the changed image (2). the default settings of 30 and 10 have been used. the result can be further improved by adjusting the intensity value.</seg>
<seg id="606">Die & digikam; Filter engraving shapes your image in 3-D as if it was stamped in wax. it uses a copyrighted algorithm by Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="607">Die & digikam; Filter engraving is a quick tool to restore your images with a 3D effect. it works particularly well with images with a simple structure, in which color is not the most important part of the content. the filter uses the differences between color and intensity to turn the image into a gray, monotonous landscape.</seg>
<seg id="608">The depth allows you to adjust the contrast of the filtering. a value of 30, corresponds to 10%, is the default setting.</seg>
<seg id="609">This is an example of engraving Filter. the original (1) and the edited image (2). the used depth is 10%.</seg>
<seg id="610">With this filter group you can transform a normal photo into a work of art using distortion effects. it uses copyrighted algorithms from Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="611">Wave blocks 1: divide the image into cells and make it look as if it is considered by glass blocks.</seg>
<seg id="612">Wave blocks 2: analog to the shaft blocks 1, the picture is distorted here with a different version of glass blocks.</seg>
<seg id="613">Some effects need a long time to calculate and generate a high CPU load. you can cancel these effects at any time using the exit button.</seg>
<seg id="614">With this filter group you can transform a normal photo into a work of art using blurring effects. it uses copyrighted algorithms from Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="615">Zoom Shotter: blurred the image along star-shaped lines. this simulates the blurring a zooming camera and thus creates a dynamic expression that is often seen in sports photography.</seg>
<seg id="616">Radial blur: blurring the image by turning the pixels around a center. this simulates the blurring of a rotating camera.</seg>
<seg id="617">Distance-blurring: blurred the picture to create the effect of an unfocused camera lens. the object seems to be traced back into the background.</seg>
<seg id="618">Blurring: blurring the image by horizontal movements of the pixels. this simulates the blurring of a linear moving, z: B: taken from a car or train, camera.</seg>
<seg id="619">Blurring blurring: blurred the picture soft in the dark and strong in the bright tones. this creates photos with a dreamy and shiny soft focus effect (Hamilton effect). this is ideal for creating romantic portraits, glamour photos or adding a warm and subtle glow.</seg>
<seg id="620">Shaking blurring: blurring the image by random shifting of the pixels and thus simulates the blurring of an arbitrary moving camera.</seg>
<seg id="621">Intelligent blur: finds the paddles in the picture and wipes them without changing the rest.</seg>
<seg id="622">Mosaic: divide the photo into rectangular cells and then recreate it, by filling with an average pixel value, new.</seg>
<seg id="623">Some effects need a long time to calculate and cause a high CPU load. you can therefore cancel this calculation at any time with the exit button.</seg>
<seg id="624">The raindrops are a nice little tool to make raindrops on your picture. this gives natural your images a wet look. it uses a algorithm protected by Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="625">Droplet size allows to change the size of the drops. since the droplet size does not automatically grow with the size of the image it is often necessary to reduce the size for small images.</seg>
<seg id="626">You can use the Edit & Edit; image processing to keep an area free of raindrops. use the selection tool to select the area, e.g. a face that should remain free. if you start the filter then the area will remain free of raindrops.</seg>
<seg id="627">This is an example of the raindrop filter. the original image (1) shows a quiet sunset and the edited image (2) suggests a sunset after a storm. the default values have been used for this example.</seg>
<seg id="628">If the photo has the wrong orientation, you can place it by mirroring or rotating in the correct orientation. the tools for this can be found in the Transformation Utilities menu or transforming mirroring.</seg>
<seg id="629">Inflating photo is definitely one of the most advanced tools to enlarge a photo with a minimal loss of picture quality.</seg>
<seg id="630">The big question is, how can you inflate an image and keep the details sharp? how can you zoom into an image when the limits of resolution are reached? how can you recover the missing information? try it and you will see it yourself.</seg>
<seg id="631">If a photo has the wrong size, you can scale it to the desired size with the tool size. choose this transformation size change in the menu and enter the target values. the dialog is shown below.</seg>
<seg id="632">The tool for size change uses a linear interpolation method to approximate the pixels. if you want to enlarge a small picture with better quality then try the tool for inflating.</seg>
<seg id="633">Many image editing programs use a kind of interpolation, e.g. spline interpolation to enlarge an image. & digikam; uses a further developed approach. the underlying algorithm photo was developed by the IMAGE team of the CNRS laboratories in Caen / France and is part of the CImg project.</seg>
<seg id="634">You have to tell the tool how you want to change the size. these settings are available in the New Size tab and listed below:</seg>
<seg id="635">Maintain aspect ratio: if this setting is enabled, the aspect ratio of the original image will be retained when entering the new size.</seg>
<seg id="636">Regularity: [0, 100]: this parameter affects larger structures. the higher this value is set, the more is smoothed. this is necessary if there is a lot of noise as it is then difficult to estimate the geometry of the image. even if you want to create a 'van Gogh' turbulence effect it must be set higher than 3.</seg>
<seg id="637">The Save As and Load buttons are used exactly for this purpose. any staffing for photo magnification can be saved as a text file and loaded later.</seg>
<seg id="638">Inflate photo is very fast with what it does, but it can take a long time and pull a high CPU load. you can cancel the calculation at any time with the exit button.</seg>
<seg id="639">You can see below an example for photo bubbles by enlarging a small color image to the double size. the original is (1) and the enlarged picture (3). the preview (2) is the result of linear standard enlargement for comparison.</seg>
<seg id="640">Cutting a photo is not only a frequently performed operation, but also a frequently underestimated tool to put together a picture. to cut a photo you just need to create a rectangle with the mouse, by pressing the mouse button and drag the rectangle. you will see this rectangle while you move the mouse.</seg>
<seg id="641">When you release the mouse button again, the area of the photo will be cut off. this gives you a good overview of how your photo would look after cutting. you can change the size of the area to be cut by dragging on the corners of the rectangle.</seg>
<seg id="642">Once you are satisfied with the cut, use the button The trimming button for image editing in the toolbar and the photo is trimmed (Ctrl; + X). use the Save or Save file entries in the File menu to save the newly cut photo.</seg>
<seg id="643">In the preview area, you can change the size of the rectangle by moving the corners with the mouse. the aspect ratio defined in the dialog stays intact.</seg>
<seg id="644">You can specify the orientation as high-format or cross-format in the tool According to the aspect ratio. in the high-format, the larger value of the height and in the cross-format of the width is always assigned.</seg>
<seg id="645">The tool According to aspect ratio is using a relative aspect ratio. this means that it is always the same regardless of whether you are inch, inch or any other physical size. you can see, for example, a list of traditional sizes for photo paper and their aspect ratio below.</seg>
<seg id="646">At the right end of the dialog there are two buttons to automatically center the selection horizontally or vertically.</seg>
<seg id="647">At the bottom of the dialog you can use the Max. relationship button to cut the area to the greatest possible, depending on the chosen ratio and orientation.</seg>
<seg id="648">The tool According to aspect ratio saves its settings depending on the image orientation (horizontal or vertical). if you use the cutting tool the next time, these settings are displayed as default values depending on orientation. the changed image dimensions are stored in the EXIF tables, so that the EXIF data reflect the cut image and not the original image.</seg>
<seg id="649">The settings of the assembly help make it possible to dazzle help, so that you can better compile your pictures. these help are:</seg>
<seg id="650">Harmonious triangles are based on the principle of similarity. like the third angel, harmonious triangles are a possibility to share a rectangle in similarly harmonious triangles on the diagonals.</seg>
<seg id="651">Golden center: the golden center is a division that is based on different natural growth patterns, such as the spiral of a Nautilus shell or the leaves of a sunflower. it appears in all possible things that we perceive as beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="652">The golden ratio is the irrational number 1,618033988... and you have been used by the ancient Egyptians and Greeks who constructed your temples and pyramids. artists and architects have used the golden ratio in all times when you put your pictures, buildings and even photos to give your creations a natural order and beauty.</seg>
<seg id="653">The number derives from Fibonacci sequence 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34 & etc; the resulting divider is 1: 1.618 the golden mean.</seg>
<seg id="654">The golden center provides more liquid relief lines when you put together a picture. these help are listed below:</seg>
<seg id="655">The Golden Spirale will bring you good results for your photos. compared to the third angel, the golden spiral produces a liquid line that can follow the eye through the image. this kind of composition leads the viewer's gaze along the line of the spiral and creates a symmetrical visual flow in this way.</seg>
<seg id="656">Another rule is the rectangles of the golden spiral, also called golden rectangles. this rectangles are used to create the golden spiral. it should be something that the eye directs into the center of the composition. that can be a line or different objects.</seg>
<seg id="657">The golden triangles also derive from the gold spiral discussed above. their vertices are the central points of the sides of the golden rectangles. note that in contrast to harmonious triangles, golden triangles are not equal triangles. diagonal to these lines can appear a static object more dynamic.</seg>
<seg id="658">If you use golden triangles to break up your frame, create an effect that is called dynamic symmetry by professional photographers. try to place your focus on one of the intersection points and other visual information in the triangles.</seg>
<seg id="659">The Horizontal mirroring options can be used to mirror the harmonic divisions.</seg>
<seg id="660">With the button Color you can set the color of the guides. if you have an image with many colors and a high contrast, the lines can be invisible. in this way, you can adjust the color of the lines to your current image.</seg>
<seg id="661">The free rotation is a tool to rotate an image at any angle.</seg>
<seg id="662">If you make a photo, then it happens easily that you do not keep the camera exactly vertical or horizontally. this creates a picture in which things are rotated by an angle. you can do this using the Edit & digikam; image processing and the tool free rotation. choose to transform Free Rotation and adjust the target angle.</seg>
<seg id="663">Rotate your image with the slide angle. the values on this slider are specified in degrees. with the Preferences button you can set the slider to 0 degrees. a preview of the rotation is available on the right side of the window. the new dimensions of the image are shown on the top right.</seg>
<seg id="664">For your help, the Free Rotation module provides a horizontal and a vertical line. move the mouse cursor in the image preview to position the two lines. after moving it over an important point of the image, you can press it with a pressure on the left mouse button. now adjust the angle as described in previous section.</seg>
<seg id="665">After you have shot an image you will find unwanted triangular holes in the corners. one way to fix this is to use the function Transforming cropping from image processing.</seg>
<seg id="666">An elegant way to cut the image is automatic cutting. choose one of the following options:</seg>
<seg id="667">The Anti-Aliases option smoothes the picture a bit after rotation. note however the above warning.</seg>
<seg id="668">All perspectival transformations are performed by a fixed point to the so-called reference point. this point is shown in the middle of the picture and is represented by a red circle.</seg>
<seg id="669">To change the perspective you need to use the red squares at the corners of your image. the preview will be automatically recalculated. on the right side of the dialog you will find some information that will help you change the perspective:</seg>
<seg id="670">New width: displays the width of the new image, including the empty spaces formed by the transformation into pixels.</seg>
<seg id="671">New height: displays the height of the new image, including the empty spaces formed by the transformation into pixels.</seg>
<seg id="672">Angle to the left: displays the current angle in degrees at the top left corner of the transformed area.</seg>
<seg id="673">Angle to the right: shows the current angle in degrees at the top right corner of the transformed area.</seg>
<seg id="674">Angle to the left: displays the current angle in degrees at the lower left corner of the transformed area.</seg>
<seg id="675">Angle to the right: shows the current angle in degrees at the lower right corner of the transformed area.</seg>
<seg id="676">After adjusting the perspective, the picture is slightly smeared. for a single adjustment, this effect is small, but two adjustments create a double so strong effect and you should avoid this if possible.</seg>
<seg id="677">After you have adjusted the perspective you get unhappy triangular holes in the corners. one way to clean this is to cut the picture with transformers cropping out of the image processing.</seg>
<seg id="678">The shuttering tool is used to move a part of the image in one direction and move the other part into the opposite direction. a horizontal shift, for example, will shift the upper part of the image to the right and the bottom part to the left. in other words, a rectangle is turned into a parallelogram.</seg>
<seg id="679">Drag your image by using the horizontal angle and the vertical angle. if you press presets, the angle will be reset to zero. a preview of the effect will be displayed to you and the new dimensions of the target image are displayed on the right of the preview pane.</seg>
<seg id="680">For your help, a vertical and a horizontal line are displayed. move the mouse to an important point, such as the lake, a wall of a building on your image and press the left mouse button to fix the lines. you can now use the shuttering tool to adjust your image.</seg>
<seg id="681">After you have done the shearing, the picture gets blurred. for a single shearing this effect is usually negligible, but two certifications generate twice as much blurring and therefore you should avoid this.</seg>
<seg id="682">After shearing the picture has unattractive triangular holes in the corners. one way to eliminate it is to cut the picture with transformers cropping out of the image processing.</seg>
<seg id="683">You need a number of libraries and other packages to read and write image formats. therefore, the formats available depend on your system and, in some cases, from the way these libraries have been compiled. in most distributions you will be able to edit a large number of image formats.</seg>
<seg id="684">Due to this dependency on other libraries it is impossible to give a list of all file formats available on your system. however, you will always find JPEG and TIFF below.</seg>
<seg id="685">& digikam; displays only files in formats that you know. this is done on the basis of the file extension and a comparison of those with a predefined list. if the extension is listed in the list, the file in image editing will be displayed. you can change this list of file extensions and edit them. in the Configuration section, you will find more information.</seg>
<seg id="686">Almost all digital cameras store photos in one of two formats: JPEG or TIFF. some cameras allow you even to select the format to be used. a more detailed description of these file formats can be found in Wikipedia. & digikam; supports both formats.</seg>
<seg id="687">Image compression is the application of data compression procedures on digital images. redundant information is reduced in order to save the image data in a more efficient way.</seg>
<seg id="688">JPEG 2000 is also supported. generally, there are better, smoother results than JPEG at the same compression ratio. the 2000 version can also save lossless when specified in the settings.</seg>
<seg id="689">If you want to learn more about the raw image format, see Wikipedia, The Luminous Landscape and Cambridge in Colour very helpful instructions in English. you can convert raw format images to JPEG or TIFF with the raw image converter by & digikam; in the Configuration section, you will find more information about using Modules with & digikam;.</seg>

<seg id="702">(1): this progress bar shows the status of the filter to the current image. to the left of it, five buttons allow to change the comparison mode of the preview area. these modes are:</seg>
<seg id="703">Vertically share without duplicate. the left pane shows the original and the right shows the filter applied to the area on the right of the selected preview pane.</seg>
<seg id="704">Horizontal parts without duplicates. the upper section shows the original and the lower one shows the filter applied to the area below the selected preview pane.</seg>
<seg id="705">The left pane shows the original and the right to compare the effect of the filter.</seg>
<seg id="706">Horizontal dividing. the upper section shows the original and the lower one for comparison with the effect of the filter.</seg>
<seg id="707">'Mouse over 'style: shows the preview when the mouse is not in the preview area and otherwise the original.</seg>
<seg id="708">(2): there are two buttons that you can turn on to display over and under exposure. the colors used can be adjusted in the general settings page.</seg>
<seg id="709">(3): the frame to preview. you can drag this frame with the mouse within the image and place it on the part of the image you want to preview. preview in the left part of the dialog will be updated immediately.</seg>
<seg id="710">(5): in the lower left corner: here is a help and the possibility to reset all buttons to your default values. all settings of the last use of the module are noted.</seg>
<seg id="711">The page bar Properties displays the essential information about the selected image and is largely self-explanatory. it is grouped in the following sections:</seg>
<seg id="712">Photo Properties: displays a summary of the most important parameters when shooting the photo. these data are from the EXIF data when they are available.</seg>
<seg id="713">This tab provides an intuitive card search tool based on the Marble mini program. you can zoom in or out with the mouse wheel or hold it down and move it. move it while you press the left mouse button. press Ctrl; left mouse button to move a square. all images within these coordinates are filtered and displayed. of course, this requires your images to contain geo-data.</seg>
<seg id="714">& kcoloredit; is an editor for palettes files. the application can be used to edit color palettes and for selecting and naming colors.</seg>
<seg id="715">The pallet files, which are installed by & kde, can apply either to the entire system or only one user. in the latter case, they are located in your Personal folder for & kde; -Settings and Hot user defined color and last used colors.</seg>
<seg id="716">In the dialog box, you can select from a list of installed pallets or browse the folders for files.</seg>
<seg id="717">The cursor is displayed as a line in the pallet view. it can be moved by clicking on the area next to a color.</seg>
<seg id="718">The color is described under the pallet view. here, the color name can also be changed.</seg>
<seg id="719">It can also be used to select. to create such a selection, click the area next to a color to move the cursor there. then move the mouse with pressed left mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="720">If the check box With the cursor is enabled under the button color, the color will be inserted from the color table at the cursor. the color is either inserted or overwritten a different one; depending on whether the mode overwrite is selected.</seg>
<seg id="721">A selection that has been created as described in the last section can be used together with the actions Copy, Cut and Paste.</seg>
<seg id="722">& kcoloredit; uses the following format for data in the clipboard: for each color three values for the shares of red, green and blue and an optional color name followed by a line-end character, if another color follows.</seg>
<seg id="723">The colors in the palette and the output of the color selection can be dragged with the mouse.</seg>
<seg id="724">Select a color somewhere on the screen and then find them in the color selection on the left.</seg>
<seg id="725">Graphviz; is a KDE program used to view & graphviz; -dot; the & graphviz; programs are free layout programs. so far there was no modern & GUI; program to visualize graphs. the programs that include & graphviz; include, are based on the program author's & X11; - or & tcltk; programs with just a few functions.</seg>
<seg id="726">The & kgraphiviewer; project has set itself the goal of replacing these programs with a modern and user-friendly graphical interface with all functions of a well integrated & que; program.</seg>
<seg id="727">& calliviewer; is a KDE program for viewing & graphviz; -dot; -Graphs. die & graphviz; programs are free layout programs. & calliviewer; displays graphs with all the capabilities of a well integrated & GUI; program in a modern and user-friendly & GUI; it has the following functions:</seg>
<seg id="728">Integration in & kate; and & konqueror; (so that a change of the graph in & kate; the graph is recomputed and displayed in & calliviewer;)</seg>
<seg id="729">Menu to open the graph in & kate; to open or graphs in & calliviewer; in a & kate; component to open</seg>
<seg id="730">Loading large graphs (currently there are problems starting at about 1000 knots and a hack to present more than these nodes)</seg>
<seg id="731">Further required software: & kgraphiviewer; is a & kde; program that presupposes the & graphviz; tool & dot; for the presentation of the graphs. required in detail:</seg>
<seg id="732">The main window displays the opened graphs, each in its own subwindow. initially, if you start & calliviewer; without an argument, the main window is empty as in the lower screenshot. in this case, the toolbar contains only the icon file and the (empty) list of last opened files. click the first icon to open the dialog file.</seg>
<seg id="733">After selecting one or more 'dot' files, the main window looks like in the lower screenshot:</seg>
<seg id="734">As you can see, an overview in the corner is displayed when the graph is larger than the drawing area. you can select a fixed position of this overview with the context menu or select this position automatically.</seg>
<seg id="735">Use the mouse wheel (up and down without special keys, left and right with pressed and Alt + key);</seg>
<seg id="736">Zooming is limited in both directions by factor 10. below you see the maximum reduction of a graph.</seg>
<seg id="737">If the currently loaded file has been modified by another program, the following window will be displayed:</seg>
<seg id="738">You can choose whether the graph is to be recharged or whether you want to ignore the change. & kgraphviewer; can also remember your decision, so that later it will also be done. if you want to change your decision later, you can use the menu item Settings calliviewer; set up..., see also.</seg>
<seg id="739">If you open a graph file outside a running & calliviewer; instance open, eg; in the file browser or on the command line, you have the choice if you want to open a new & calliviewer; or want to display the graphs to be loaded in a subwindow of the already running instance.</seg>
<seg id="740">As with the last option, you can save your choice permanently, but can change it afterwards with the setup dialog.</seg>
<seg id="741">At program start, you can reopen all graphs of your last session. again, you can save your choice both as well as change it later.</seg>
<seg id="742">You can also specify how to split the graph to several pages. the number of horizontal and vertical pages can be freely selected.</seg>
<seg id="743">If you are using multiple pages, you can choose whether the parts of the graph, which come to one page, be adjusted to this page. the aspect ratio is ignored. if you keep the aspect ratio, the pages may not be filled out by the respective sections of the graph.</seg>
<seg id="744">Page preview with one graph distributed over several pages without header and with a different font</seg>
<seg id="745">Page Erneut Load gives you the ability to specify the behavior when a file has been changed to the hard drive & eg; from another program. you can set a default behavior (automatically reload or ignore changes) or ask the program each time.</seg>
<seg id="746">The opening page allows you to specify the behavior of & kgraphically, when a graph is opened outside of a current session. you can set a default behavior for this case (open the graph in a new window or in a subwindow of the current session) or determine that each time is requested.</seg>
<seg id="747">The session administration page gives you the possibility to specify the starting behavior of & calliviewer; you can set a default behavior (open or not open the files of the last session or not), or decide to be asked at any start afterwards.</seg>
<seg id="748">The context menu, which usually appears at a click in the main window with the & RMBN, opens up additional options:</seg>
<seg id="749">Here you can choose among various & graphviz; -Layout algorithms. the entries described on the website of & graphviz are:</seg>
<seg id="750">The algorithm sets the edges in the same direction (from top to bottom or from left to right) and tries to produce as short edges as possible and as few edge overlaps as possible.</seg>
<seg id="751">The & neato; algorithm is the default for ungerized graphene. it produces depictions according to the springboard model. the Kamada-Kawai algorithm is used, which is synonymous with statistically multidimensional scaling.</seg>
<seg id="752">The & FDP; algorithm generates a springboard model for ungerified graphene. it uses the fruchterman-pure gold heuristics, and includes a multi-purpose trigger for treating large and clustered graphene.</seg>
<seg id="753">The & Circo; algorithm arranges the nodes circularly according to the description of Six und Tollis, 1999, and Kauffman and Wiese, 2002. it is useful for certain diagrams of multiple cyclic structures.</seg>
<seg id="754">Opens a dialog where you can specify a layout command that will then be executed by a shell. the command should accept the graph file as a parameter, and display the calculated layout of the graphene after stdout in xdot format. with such a layout command, you can give & eg; den & graphviz; -algorithms to change the graph with a filter before being drawn.</seg>
<seg id="755">Determines the type of graph (judged or executed) and uses the default algorithm for the respective type (dot; for directional, & neato; for ungerified graphs).</seg>
<seg id="756">If this setting is enabled, the overview shows if necessary. otherwise it will not appear and the positioning menu is inactive.</seg>
<seg id="757">Shows the What is the mouse pointer. with this mouse pointer, click on a & GUI; element to get more help to this element (if any).</seg>
<seg id="758">A list of changes is available from this address and in the file changelog in the base directory of the source archive.</seg>
<seg id="759">& calliViewer; is a & kde; program using the & graphviz; tools for rendering. it requires the following program packages:</seg>
<seg id="760">A special setup is not necessary to use & calliviewer; in the Settings menu you will find more options.</seg>

<seg id="772">The KIPI module to read pictures provides tools to read and store new images.</seg>
<seg id="773">This module can be used to read and store new images from external sources. currently, two sources can be used:</seg>
<seg id="774">Scan images: uses the Kooka interface to read pictures from a scanner that supports the sane project or another source such as Video Streams. to work with it you have to have Kooka and sane installed.</seg>
<seg id="775">When you open the menu entry images, a dialog appears that lets you select between all available sources on your computer. select the source you want to get the image here. you can also set the default source for the next time.</seg>
<seg id="776">After that, the Kooka window will pop up by replacing the default ducts own to select your image accordingly. view the preview and adjust the area to your needs before you scan the image with the button. the estimated file size will be displayed in the right, bottom corner. in the Kooka manual you will find more information.</seg>
<seg id="777">Make sure that the window is completely displayed as some settings may not be displayed otherwise.</seg>
<seg id="778">After pressing the button you have to wait until the scan is completed and the window to specify the image file will appear. please remember that the type BMP does not compress and therefore creates very large files. you also need to select or create the folder & # 160 by saving the image.</seg>
<seg id="779">You can create screenshots after selecting the Import &gt; screen shot in the menu. a window appears in which you can set the different screenshots:</seg>
<seg id="780">Select the complete desktop to read a single window under the mouse.</seg>
<seg id="781">If all your own program windows are selected, the calling program will disappear, so you can see other screens and windows. otherwise, after a short delay, you will read the currently visible workspace.</seg>
<seg id="782">The delay determines how long screen shot will wait before it starts. if you need to switch to other worktops, you should select this delay enough to have the time to navigate there.</seg>
<seg id="783">After the screenshot has been made, the dialog box appears with the options described above.</seg>

<seg id="796">Flickr is an online photo management on the Internet. Flickr allows you to send photos to people who are important to you. you can show your favorite photos of the world, place the photos of your camera online and show your photos safely and privately to your friends and family around the world.</seg>
<seg id="797">The Export to Flickr module can be used to upload images from your computer to a Flickr server on the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="798">When you use the module for the first time, you are guided through the creation of a token. this is used for your authentication. so it is virtually your reference to Flickr. a browser is started so that you can log in at Flickr.</seg>
<seg id="799">After the successful registration, the module can send photos to the Flickr website. the following page will be presented to you after a successful registration.</seg>
<seg id="800">Simply close the browser window and return to the program. after pressing Yes, you get the dialog to upload photos to Flickr. this will be shown in the next section.</seg>
<seg id="801">If the Export to Flickr is started for the second time, you will be greeted with the following dialog, which displays the current access permissions that the module displays. you will need write permission to upload it. you will be asked if you want to continue with these permissions.</seg>
<seg id="802">The button Add Photos should be pressed once you have set all the other options. with this button you can select the photos you want to upload in a file selection box. when you press the Ok button starts uploading the photos to Flickr Server.</seg>
<seg id="803">The keyword field can be filled with a comma separated list of words. these are added to the image as key words during the upload.</seg>
<seg id="804">The Public, Friends and Famillie options allow you to set the permissions on your images. by default, the photos are classified as private.</seg>
<seg id="805">If you select the option Change the size of the photos before uploading, the photos are changed before uploading in the size. the size is taken from the value entered at maximum size.</seg>
<seg id="806">The maximum size can be used to specify the maximum height of the images. the size is changed in such a way that the aspect ratio remains constant.</seg>
<seg id="807">The KIPI module gallery export is a tool to export your picture collection to a gallery server</seg>
<seg id="808">The KIPI module gallery export currently has no documentation. if you are interested in writing them, please contact the mailing list of the KIPI team at kde-imaging @ kde.org. Please note: the participants of this list speak English.</seg>
<seg id="809">The geographic location KIPI module allows you to add and edit GPS coordinates in the metadata of an image. the geographical data is stored in the EXIF catchwords of the image and localization can be displayed in a map in an external browser.</seg>
<seg id="810">The KIPI module for geographic localization provides tools to locate geographically in the spherical coordinate system used by GPS and Galileo. height, longitude and latitude are used.</seg>
<seg id="811">To correlate your images with geographical data you need a GPS track as XML file in GPX format. gpsbabel and gpsman can download and convert the data for you from your GPS device.</seg>
<seg id="812">Image Geographical localization correlative. this interface can merge a number of previously selected images with a GPS trace.</seg>
<seg id="813">Select the images you want to correlate in the main window and enter the menu. the above-looking dialog appears then. to perform a possible correlation between time and location, you need to load a track file with GPX file.</seg>
<seg id="814">When the file is loaded an automatic correlation that indicates the coordinates in red. GPS trace data are recorded in GMT time and therefore the camera position must be converted to GMT. this can be done with the time zone. set your camera time zone here.</seg>
<seg id="815">The setting for the maximum time deviation indicates the upper deviation for the GPS time and camera position. if the deviation is lower, the data is merged. the maximum value for this is 2000 seconds.</seg>
<seg id="816">If you have no trace data from one place for images, you can manually edit the GPX file and add to the pictures. the time difference of 2000 seconds will then correlate all the images in this area.</seg>
<seg id="817">The options interpolate and difference in minutes can be used if you have no suitable data. if you know that in reality a location is located in a big time difference between camera and GPS, you can set these limits here and then press the button correlate to interpolate.</seg>
<seg id="818">The coordinates can be manually set with this dialog. this is useful when you have made a number of photos in the same place. since the dialog displays the coordinates of one call to the next you just need to use the button OK to set the data in the current photo.</seg>
<seg id="819">The location can also be found and set with the displayed map. to do so, select the region and enlarge it e.Add this time and again until you have reached a sufficient accuracy. the height must always be selected manually. the card can be changed between card mode, satellite image and a mixed mode.</seg>
<seg id="820">Completely outside the KIPI module, there are possibilities to hang the GPS data to the images. here is a small script that uses the hexidool to provide a pile of images with GPS data.</seg>
<seg id="821">The KIPI module picture gallery is a tool to export a set of albums as HTML pages.</seg>
<seg id="822">This module can export your albums into a picture gallery from HTML pages to version 4.01. you can select the albums that are to be exported as HTML pages and specify the parameters for the HTML pages.</seg>
<seg id="823">The tab has four tabs in which the settings can be adjusted. the tab selection allows you to select all albums that should be exported to HTML. the albums are not displayed hierarchically. with the three buttons on the right you can quickly select a large number of albums. in the area below you will see the Albenpreview and the text that will appear in the header of the HTML page.</seg>
<seg id="824">This tab is largely self-explanatory. the option For each image to create a page creates a gallery in which each image also gets its own page. if you click on an image, a new page opens in which the picture is displayed. otherwise, the image will be displayed directly with your standard image viewer, eg;</seg>
<seg id="825">The Album defines the settings where and how to save the gallery with all your associated images. select a folder on which you have write permission. a subfolder named KIPIHTMLExport which contains everything will be created there.</seg>
<seg id="826">If you have selected the JPEG File Format, the EXIF information of your original images will also be stored in the new images.</seg>
<seg id="827">With Other color depth you can change the default color depth, which of course affects the file size. all other settings are self-explanatory.</seg>
<seg id="828">The Rider thumbnails allows you to customize some of the settings from the Album tab for the thumbnails, these are small images that are displayed in the gallery.</seg>
<seg id="829">A progress window shows the user how far the action is. press Cancel to cancel the process.</seg>
<seg id="830">If the module has created the pages, the window is not automatically closed. you can therefore read the program messages to determine if errors occurred during production. the web browser is automatically started at the end to preview the gallery. press Close to close the module.</seg>
<seg id="831">The KIPI Image Viewer is a very fast and flexible OpenGL-based tool for viewing images.</seg>
<seg id="832">The KIPI image viewer allows you to view a selection of images and to perform basic operations such as rotations, zooming or moving. the viewer can be used with short commands and mouse buttons. it has been developed for quick image display and quick access to its functions.</seg>
<seg id="833">After the start, a picture is displayed by default in full screen mode. this can be changed to a window mode.</seg>
<seg id="834">The KIPI JPEG Lossless Module is a tool to change images without compromising your quality.</seg>
<seg id="835">This module allows you to save images in JPEG format for the actions listed below, without the usual loss of quality or metadata.</seg>
<seg id="836">The consequence of lossless storage is that the file size increases since there is no compression of the color information.</seg>
<seg id="837">The KIPI module digital camera client is a tool to connect your computer to a digital camera.</seg>
<seg id="838">The KIPI module digital camera client does not currently have documentation. if you are interested in writing them, please contact the mailing list of the KIPI team at kde-imaging @ kde.org. Please note: the participants of this list speak English.</seg>
<seg id="839">The KIPI module metadata editor currently has no documentation. if you want to change this situation, please contact the kde-imaging @ kde.org of the KIPI team.</seg>
<seg id="840">With the import function of the metadata module, you can copy data from one image to another. then select the image that you want to copy in the main program and then invoke the Import function. this then opens the file selection dialog with which you want to copy the target image, i.e. the image to which you want to copy the metadata.</seg>
<seg id="841">This function does not work with all image formats. you can copy from anywhere, but do not write into any target format. JPEG is supported while writing. please take a look at exiv2 to see which formats are supported.</seg>
<seg id="842">The KIPI MPEG Kodierer module is a tool to convert a number of images into a MPEG video in the form of a slide show.</seg>
<seg id="843">The MPEG codec module can be used to convert selected images to a MPEG video, with a defined length. this module uses the packages MjpegTools and ImageMagick. you can also add a base image transition between the individual images. you can also add an audio file to the MP2 or WAV of the slideshow.</seg>
<seg id="844">All images are automatically scaled to the correct size for the selected video format. additionally you can select a background color for the slideshow. with this module it is possible to create the formats DVD / XVCD / SVCD / VCD for your DVD player. to burn the medium you can finally use the K3b program.</seg>
<seg id="845">You must first select the images to be packed into the MPEG Diashau. after that you can create the module via Tools MPEG Diasau.</seg>
<seg id="846">The images you select are then listed in image files in the Portfolio. there you can also sort the images or the contents of the list.</seg>
<seg id="847">After you are satisfied with your list, you should adjust the other settings. the video format can be selected from various formats, DVD, XVCD, SVCD and VCD. if you plan to play the file on a TV, you need to select the appropriate TV standard PAL, SECAM or NTSC. PAL is default and most likely the right choice for Europe.</seg>
<seg id="848">In the next step, you should specify the time in seconds that a picture is displayed. the speed of the image transition is defined below. a low value creates a very sudden, high contrast, very smooth image changes.</seg>
<seg id="849">The background color can be set next. in doubt, you should leave it black. you can set the name and path of the generated file in the name of the MPEG-output file. keep the extension mpg as possible.</seg>
<seg id="850">If you specify an audio file under the name of the audio source file, it will be integrated into the movie. after you have adapted all settings to your preferences, you can start the movie with the button coding. depending on the speed of your computer, you can now quickly or quietly enjoy a coffee and enjoy the slideshow if you are back.</seg>
<seg id="851">If a note appears that encoders or tools are missing, you can adjust the paths to the programs of the MjpegTools and ImageMagick packages via the button Settings on the bottom right.</seg>
<seg id="852">The Print Job Wizard allows you to print multiple images on a sheet of paper along with standard photo sizes. the combined images can also be automatically opened using the image processing Gimp. this is e.g. useful to improve you or print with the Gimp module for direct printing.</seg>
<seg id="853">With this KIPI module, you can import or convert your images stored in RAW format in one of three formats JPEG, TIFF or PPM.</seg>
<seg id="854">The conversion is based on the command-line tool dcraw from Dave Coffin. an original quote from him is: do not expect from dcraw to produce the same results as the software from your camera manufacturer. sometimes you get better results with dcraw!.</seg>
<seg id="855">First select the RAW file to be converted and start the module. the Raw Image Converter window will then appear in mode for a single image. with the Preview button you can view the effect of your current settings on the image.</seg>
<seg id="856">You can now adjust the values to optimize the conversion process. the first option decides if the camera settings for the white balance should be used. the key parameters such as gamma, brightness and red / blue amplifiers can be adjusted. if the result is not optimal, you can further process the image later.</seg>
<seg id="857">A four-colour RGBG conversion can be selected to allow you to use the contrast information. if your camera works in RGB mode, the RGBG switch has no effect.</seg>
<seg id="858">Once you are satisfied with the preview, you can select one of the three output formats and save the conversion result. the file name remains the same and only the extension will be adjusted accordingly. JPEG supports a lossless algorithm and produces the smallest file sizes for it.</seg>
<seg id="859">Tagged Image Format, TIFF, retains all information from your image and uses lossless LZW compression.</seg>
<seg id="860">If you plan to edit your pictures frequently or later use it otherwise you should not select the JPEG format, since it only allows a limited number of operations before the image quality deteriorates. TIFF and PPM are better adapted to keep the original data retained.</seg>
<seg id="861">If you select JPEG as memory format, the metadata that is included in the RAW file is stored in the JPEG file in the Exif information.</seg>
<seg id="862">If you have adjusted your settings, you can start the conversion with the Run button. if you want to cancel this process again, you can use it Cancel.</seg>
<seg id="863">Batch processing mode allows you to convert different images at once. use this mode if you are sure, e.g. by testing a single image, which are the best settings.</seg>
<seg id="864">The available settings are almost identical to the version for single images. however, you have the possibility to automatically overwrite the existing file. however, this is useful if they were created in an earlier attempt. however, a preview is not available. the progress bar indicates how far the conversion has progressed.</seg>
<seg id="865">This module can be used to compress all images in an album. it uses the program convert from ImageMagick package. the following image formats are supported:</seg>
<seg id="866">This module can be used to rename all images of an album. you can set the prefix, the number and the timestamp.</seg>
<seg id="867">This module can be used to change the size of multiple images of an image collection. it uses the convert program from the ImageMagick package. you can reduce or enlarge the image. for this, four types of image change are provided:</seg>
<seg id="868">Proportional (1 Dim.): normal size change in a dimension. width or height of the image is selected automatically depending on the image orientation. the aspect ratio remains unchanged.</seg>
<seg id="869">Proportional (2 Dim.): size change in two dimensions. here the aspect ratio remains unchanged. for example, you can use this option to adjust your image to the screen format.</seg>
<seg id="870">Non-proportional: not proportional size change in two dimensions. the aspect ratio is changed with this option.</seg>
<seg id="871">Prepress: prepares the image for the photo print. the user can adjust the print resolution and the size of the photo paper. the target image, including background size, margin size and background color, will be adjusted accordingly.</seg>
<seg id="872">With this KIPI module you can send selected images with your preferred e-mail program. it is also possible to change the size of the images to be viewed.</seg>
<seg id="873">After you have started the module, the picture window will be displayed with the images you selected. you can add more images using a file selection dialog. for the last selected image, a preview will be displayed on the right side.</seg>
<seg id="874">You can also drag images to the image list and place them there to add the list of images to be sent.</seg>
<seg id="875">With the button Remove the selected images from the list of images to be sent away.</seg>
<seg id="876">After you have selected all the images, you can open the new message window of your e-mail client with the OK button. you only have to add the addresses and the subject. the pictures you selected are attached as appendix.</seg>
<seg id="877">Don't mind to send too many pictures at once. most email accounts have limitations for the size of emails to be sent. it may be a good idea to send multiple mails if you want to send a lot of pictures.</seg>
<seg id="878">The e-mail window is used to change the settings for sending the images. your configuration is stored and used every time you change it.</seg>
<seg id="879">Select your email client from the menu. if you select Thunderbird, you must specify the right path for your installation in the input field below.</seg>
<seg id="880">If you are using the Google Mail Service, you must first install the Gmail Agent on your computer. you can download it here.</seg>
<seg id="881">After selecting comments in a attached file, the comments to the images will be added to a text file and the email attached.</seg>
<seg id="882">The PNG format under the File Format menu is not very appropriate to reduce the size of photo files, but it is best adapted to lossless formats such as TIFF. you should therefore use PNG if you have a fast internet connection and the photo quality should not be changed. otherwise we recommend you the JPEG format.</seg>
<seg id="883">If you select JPEG in image file format and the original files are in JPEG format, then the original files will be added to the images to be sent.</seg>
<seg id="884">When the process is completed, the window will not automatically shut down so you can view the status messages on the search for errors. however, your e-mail program will automatically start at the end. with the closing button you can close this window.</seg>
<seg id="885">After starting the Advanced Diaschau module, a window with questions like you want to have your slide show will appear. you can choose between the selected and all pictures of the album here.</seg>
<seg id="886">The OpenGL transitions option in the presentation will enable very elegant image transitions using OpenGL. however, you will have to have a corresponding graphic card, otherwise the slide show will be very slow.</seg>
<seg id="887">The option names file names will ensure that the file name of the images is displayed in the lower left corner during the presentation.</seg>
<seg id="888">The Loop option ensures that the presentation will be displayed in an infinite loop. you can then run it manually with Esc; Cancel.</seg>
<seg id="889">The option images randomly select makes sure the images are displayed in random order. so it is not the order of the images used in the album.</seg>
<seg id="890">The distance between the images can be set between the pictures. 1500 milliseconds corresponds to 1.5 seconds and are a good default value. the best distance depends, however, on your computer and the selected transition effect.</seg>
<seg id="891">There are more than a dozen transitional effects between which you can choose. randomly selects a different effect on every transition between the images.</seg>
<seg id="892">During slide show you can access a toolbar at the top left edge of the screen. move the mouse into this corner to turn on.</seg>
<seg id="893">With this tool bar you can stop the presentation and start again, jump to the previous and the next image and stop the slideshow.</seg>
<seg id="894">At the bottom of the screen you can see the current filename, the position of the current image and the total number of images in your presentation.</seg>
<seg id="895">The KIPI module time & date has no documentation yet. if you are interested in writing them, please contact the mailing list of the KIPI team at kde-imaging @ kde.org. Please note: the participants of this list speak English.</seg>
<seg id="896">The KIPI module background image is a tool to set a picture as a background image for the work surface.</seg>
<seg id="897">This module sets the currently selected image, depending on the selected option of the submenu, as background for your KDE desktop.</seg>
<seg id="898">Once you have provided your pictures and videos with annotations, you can start with & kphotoalbum; through these, see image. as you can see by comparing with the image, are now available in each group, i.e. in people, places and in group keywords entries.</seg>
<seg id="899">In the browser window you will see the categories for which you have entered information when you have provided your images and videos with annotations. additionally, there are entries to look for EXIF-based information, view the folder structure on your hard drive and of course view the current thumbnails.</seg>
<seg id="900">When you press the mouse on the entry, the view of the browser changes. see image.</seg>
<seg id="901">When you select another person, only the images shown on which both persons can be seen. through this selection method, you can limit the number of images displayed by a few thousand images to a few single images.</seg>
<seg id="902">If you have selected all persons, places and other settings, you can display thumbnails to view the images of your area of activity.</seg>
<seg id="903">In the picture each person has the same icon in front of their name. they can store their own thumbnail album, which is of course also valid for places, keywords and other categories you have defined yourself. see the picture below.</seg>
<seg id="904">To view images in addition to the names, select the button that is located on the right side of the toolbar. in the appearing context menu, you can select which view you want to use for the current category. this has the advantage that you can view e.g. symbols with pictures of persons and simultaneously a list of keywords (if you have no suitable pictures for your keywords).</seg>
<seg id="905">However, you must specify which image should be displayed for each individual person. to do this, you need to open the picture-view window (described in more detail) and select the image for the appropriate person in the context menu. in the View window, you can customize the magnification factor according to your wishes and select which part of the image should be displayed or cut off.</seg>
<seg id="906">When you enter the search entry in the main window, a dialog is displayed that is very similar to the dialog for specifying the image properties. you can view this dialog once again.</seg>
<seg id="907">If you enter a string in the labeling or description field, the descriptions or descriptions of the images will be searched after this text. if you want, you can also enter a date to be searched; the date can either be a part of the total date, e.g. 1971, or the complete date. you can also use a range of two dates, such as 1971-1980.</seg>
<seg id="908">With the options in the lower part of the window, you can browse all images according to specific names as you can see in the picture. here you can see images on which Jesper, however, not Anne Helene are depicted.</seg>
<seg id="909">This is the user manual for & photoalbum; if you do not like to read manuals, but rather want to try functionality, you have the following alternatives to this manual:</seg>
<seg id="910">Go to the homepage of & kphotoalbum; and watch the quick entry, screenshots and introductory videos.</seg>
<seg id="911">Start & kphotoalbum; and select the demo in the first dialog, if you start & photoalbum; start the first time, or select the menu entry kphotoalbum; demo. then some sample pictures will be loaded and you can try the functions of & kphotoalbum;</seg>
<seg id="912">If you prefer to print this manual, you can find it on the homepage of & kphotoalbum; as a contiguous HTML document to download.</seg>
<seg id="913">At the bottom of the main window of & kphotoalbum; see the timeline. a picture of this bar is shown here:. as the name suggests, this bar shows you date statistics about the images in your database.</seg>
<seg id="914">The timeline can display several different units. each bar then displays another unit. you can switch between the units years, months, weeks, hours and 10 minutes. on the picture you can see a part of a database by displaying only 10 minutes sections.</seg>
<seg id="915">The timeline can be used interactively in the following ways: you can change the displayed preview pane from the database (if you select a date, the first image will display this date in the preview pane) and the timeline always displays the current date of the currently displayed pictures when you navigate in the preview pane.</seg>
<seg id="916">You can also select a section of the timeline by holding down the mouse button and drag the mouse over the ruler of the timeline, i.e. the time data. if you select an area, only images of this period will be shown in the preview view. you can cancel the selection by clicking on a bar of the timeline.</seg>
<seg id="917">& kphotoalbum; provides you two ways to create html web pages with your images. one is in & kphotoalbum; integrated and the other available as module (see). in the following part of the user manual is described in & kphotoalbum; integrated version, which you can create from the File menu HTML...</seg>
<seg id="918">Before HTML pages are created you need to make some settings. these are divided into the three areas Content, Layout, and Objective. in the following each section will be described more accurately.</seg>
<seg id="919">First, enter the title of the moment and a description that the HTML file should contain later. on kphotoalbum; HTML example pages you see an example of these settings.</seg>
<seg id="920">Next select whether a & kphotoalbum; export file to be created is to be seen on the overview page.</seg>
<seg id="921">Finally, you can choose which information to display on the HTML pages. this allows you to avoid displaying information that is obvious to the viewer. for example, all images are exported from a party. for example, all images are exported. you cannot use this setting to hide specific images from certain viewers.</seg>
<seg id="922">In this section you can specify how the HTML pages should look like. most settings are unambiguous, which is why this is not specifically addressed.</seg>
<seg id="923">At the bottom of the page you can set up various resolutions for the images. this allows those who view your website and have a monitor that supports the maximum resolution 800x600, no longer download images that have, for example, a resolution of 1600x1200.</seg>
<seg id="924">The viewer of your page can change the resolution you have specified at any time. so you can browse your images with low resolution, leading to a lower transfer time. if you want to get an image bigger, it changes to a higher resolution.</seg>
<seg id="925">In this setting, specify the different folders and the URL where your site is stored.</seg>
<seg id="926">Best choose a root folder for all your HTML files and a new subfolder for each subsequent set.</seg>
<seg id="927">First, you need to select the main folder where all your images are saved. this folder is saved and automatically added next time. this allows you to select the location for all future images. here you can either select a folder or a KDE support protocol, for example:</seg>
<seg id="928">After you have created your images, you can check if they really are visible to viewers. if you select a URL for the base folder, a web browser will be launched after the pages have been created. otherwise, the web browser will start in the wrong folder.</seg>
<seg id="929">If the HTML files created by you are not yet in the final destination folder, you have to manually copy them there. so that the import function, see, works properly you have to specify the final destination of the files. this is not the subfolder of the current files, but the base folder in which all subfolders are located.</seg>
<seg id="930">The settings described above have all related to the base folders or URLs. a subfolder will be created in them, whose name you specify in the output folder.</seg>
<seg id="931">If you are on a family celebration, a meeting in the company, a conference or somewhere else, with other users of & kphotoalbum; coming together, you might want to create an HTML page for viewing the images. however, if you have spent a lot of time for viewing the image information, people on the pictures, recording location, etc., then you must start with & kphotoalbum; this work will not happen again.</seg>
<seg id="932">With & kphotoalbum; you can export a copy of your images into a .kim file. these can import others into your database. the image properties are imported with ex- and imported.</seg>
<seg id="933">There are two different types of .kim files, internal and external. they differ in whether the images themselves are stored in the file or if there is only a link to images in the file. the advantage of saving all images into the file is that you have all the pictures together and that you can share this file as independent. however, the obvious disadvantage is the file size.</seg>
<seg id="934">You can either export a .kim file directly from the File menu... or together with HTML pages, see, create. if you create a .kim file along with an HTML file, this will be an external .kim file.</seg>
<seg id="935">An external .kim file searches the images in a twofold way. first, it searches the images that are located in the .kim file folder. if the corresponding images are not found, the images of the URL you specified when creating the HTML files will be searched. this is of course only possible if you have created your .kim file using the HTML export.</seg>
<seg id="936">In the following, the dialog for exporting images is described, which you can access via the Export Data menu.</seg>
<seg id="937">The most important option of this dialog is whether you want to deal with internal or external .kim files. you have the following three choices:</seg>
<seg id="938">In the manual copy option to the .kim file, you need to copy the images to the same folder as the .kim file.</seg>
<seg id="939">With option Automatically close to the .kim file copy & kphotoalbum; the images automatically for you.</seg>
<seg id="940">.kim files are normal zip files. since most pictures are already compressed with JPEG and the XML file itself is very small, it is usually not worthwhile to compress the files.</seg>
<seg id="941">The last option of this page is to limit the maximum image size. if you send pictures to your friends, you might not want to send the pictures in full size, since the .kim file would otherwise be very big. here you can limit the size by saying that each image should be at most 800 pixels high and wide.</seg>
<seg id="942">If you select a file with the extension .kim from the web browser or from the File menu... select, will import & kphotoalbum; the exported database as described in described.</seg>
<seg id="943">The wizard for importing is made up of four steps. first you need to select which images you want to import, then in which folder you want to copy the importing images.</seg>
<seg id="944">It may be that you personalize the category of persons belonging to the imported file (if you are a domain), while this category is named in your database. therefore, in the third dialogue window, you will be asked which categories of the file to be imported and which categories they correspond to in your database.</seg>
<seg id="945">In the fourth step, you can compare the categories of the file to be imported with the categories of your current database. an example of this can be seen in the image.</seg>
<seg id="946">It just has to be easy to browse and view pictures: if you look at pictures, you often want to jump within different picture groups and see a picture with your friend on it, you might want to see all the pictures on which this friend is depicted.</seg>
<seg id="947">In this manual, you will go through the various steps of (1) setting the information about your images, via (2) browsing and viewing, up to (3) advanced topics and customization options.</seg>
<seg id="948">It has been extended and now takes care of your videos. many places in this manual will talk about pictures, but often this includes videos with one.</seg>
<seg id="949">& kphotoalbum; stores all its information in the file index.xml in the top folder of your images. this is a simple XML file that you can backup with a program of your choice, e.g. Normal backup tools, copy to a floppy or revisions in CVS, where they want.</seg>
<seg id="950">& kphotoalbum; remembers the folder where your images are stored and use it automatically in future starts. if you want to read another database in & kphotoalbum; you can start & kphotoalbum; with the -c option. as an example: kphotoalbum -c ~ / company / images / index.xml.</seg>
<seg id="951">Via the menu entry Settings kphotoalbum; set up... you will get to a window with which you can change the settings of & kphotoalbum; in the following section of the User Manual the various settings are explained.</seg>
<seg id="952">On the left you can see six different icons that allow you to view settings of the preview and the options for the viewer. for each setting there is a detailed help that can be called by pressing the F1 key and clicking on the desired option.</seg>
<seg id="953">It describes how you can define various properties for each image, e.g. persons, places and keywords. you can also create your own groups, such as objects, animals or albums.</seg>
<seg id="954">You can see the dialog used to edit existing groups. for each existing group, you can select a label and a symbol.</seg>
<seg id="955">In the Options section, subcategories have already been mentioned. in the Options dialog, you can set up complete member groups, i.e. all members of a group at once in a group, rather than all groups of a member as explained in.</seg>
<seg id="956">In the list below you can select the category you want to configure. in the left half of the window you can select the category you want to configure. in the left half of the window you will find a list of the current category and in the right a list of subcategories.</seg>
<seg id="957">& kphotoalbum; splits its module system with other graphic applications, such as digiplug and Gwenview. this module system is called KIPI and means & kde; Image Plugin interface.</seg>
<seg id="958">The modules can be called via the Module menu. the modules can and will not be described in this manual as they are not part of & kphotoalbum; however, most modules have a help page that you can call via the module itself.</seg>
<seg id="959">Since the modules are used by several applications together, it may be that the modules with & kphotoalbum; only very little tested. therefore, you should always test new modules with the demo database before you apply them to your own pictures The & kphotoalbum; demo database can either call you through the command line with the command &gt; kphotoalbum -Demo &lt; userinput\ &gt; or via the Help menu. don't say that I wouldn't have warned you!</seg>
<seg id="960">The applications that use the modules over KIPI are very different, making it possible that some modules with & kphotoalbum; not work. this is the disadvantage when sharing features with different applications.</seg>
<seg id="961">The biggest difference between & kphotoalbum; and other applications that also use KIPI is that the other applications can arrange their images in albums: an album is simply a folder. even though & kphotoalbum; this kind of order does not support, it simulates order after albums for some modules, so that you can use the functions with & kphotoalbum;</seg>
<seg id="962">Simulates & kphotoalbum; the current album, which just corresponds to the current view, so all pictures that show you the picture preview at the moment.</seg>
<seg id="963">In addition to the current album, you need to give the modules a list of albums as well. here goes & kphotoalbum; as follows:</seg>
<seg id="964">If & kphotoalbum; s Browser shows the contents of a category, e.g. all persons, then each entry of this category represents an album for the module.</seg>
<seg id="965">Or it will use the category you have set in the Settings dialog as a category for virtual albums. so, for example, if you use the category Persons, will do & kphotoalbum; so do so if you chose people to view it and pass it on to the module.</seg>
<seg id="966">Since some modules with & kphotoalbum are not compatible, you can remove them from the list of modules. start the settings dialog and select which modules to load.</seg>
<seg id="967">On the picture you can see an example of a start screen as soon as you start & kphotoalbum; start with your own pictures.</seg>
<seg id="968">As you are used by any other KDE application, you will see a menu and toolbar at the top. currently, it does not contain much information as you have not entered your image database. in the section, we will return to this window, but now click on the image to show you an overview of all existing pictures.</seg>
<seg id="969">One of the main features of & kphotoalbum; is the ability to see any picture with annotations. this includes information about the persons shown on the image, where the image is taken. you can set each image individually or for a larger number of pictures at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="970">All these notes can be used for searching and browsing as you can read in the section. if you want you can see these comments if you use the built-in viewer.</seg>
<seg id="971">You can view three lists with a text box by setting people, places and keywords. these are a very important part of & kphotoalbum; as you will always use them again whenever you enter information about your pictures.</seg>
<seg id="972">The following idea is based on moving the images within the list: for example, if you have a family party and are shown on all 50 images the same 5-10 persons, you can, by shifting the names used upwards, find the persons faster and assign them.</seg>
<seg id="973">If you prefer to get an alphabetically sorted list, click on the Sorting button on the date below the list.</seg>
<seg id="974">If you have selected annotations for each image separately, you may want to edit all the selected images and add them with annotations. in this case, simply click on the above and back buttons, which are located at the top of the image below.</seg>
<seg id="975">If you have recorded multiple images, e.g. with the same person, it can be more convenient to mark all these images and use the menu item Multiple entries at once with a note.</seg>
<seg id="976">Las Vegas, San Francisco, Los Angeles and California are all located in the US. San Francisco and Los Angeles are also in California.</seg>
<seg id="977">In the picture you can see a browser window that shows the USA as a subgroup. to show you that it is a supergroup, a special symbol is displayed.</seg>
<seg id="978">In the Comment dialog context menu it is possible to add an entry to an existing or new subcategory. in addition, you can also simply drag an entry into a category and drop it to make it an subcategory of this entry.</seg>
<seg id="979">You can move the individual elements of the annotation dialog by clicking and moving the bars that form the top edge of the frame. you can also make your own window from a frame by dragging it out of the window area.</seg>
<seg id="980">If you have adapted the look of the window to your needs so that you are satisfied with the settings, click on the Options button... that offers you the possibility to save the current layout and appearance of the window.</seg>
<seg id="981">You can also completely fade out a frame. if you want to see this window later, use the Options button... and then hide / hide windows. you can see this in the picture.</seg>
<seg id="982">If you select the entry Images in the browser, you will get an overview with thumbnail images of the currently selected images, or all the images in case you have no filter. an example of this can be seen here. you can configure the size of thumbnails, by simply dragging the mouse with the middle mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="983">If you drop an image on the background of your desktop, this image is set up as a wallpaper for your desktop.</seg>
<seg id="984">Once you click on an image, it will be displayed in the image viewer. if you haven't opened a window with an image viewer, a new display window will be created.</seg>
<seg id="985">You can also delete images in the image preview. simply select the appropriate images you want to delete and press either the Remove button or select Delete from the Edit menu. now the window will be displayed you can see in the picture.</seg>
<seg id="986">& kphotoalbum; offers you a solution for this problem. you can use with & kphotoalbum; namely, you can use the images anywhere, so that & kphotoalbum; you can record in the database index. in the picture you see the view of & kphotoalbum; if not all needed pictures can be loaded from the hard drive.</seg>
<seg id="987">Images in which the upper left corner is clipped are not saved on the hard drive. however, for the pictures 5-9 the thumbnails are present, so that & kphotoalbum; you can preview these pictures with the image viewer.</seg>
<seg id="988">As you see, this function requires you to copy files from the folders and copy them back. & kphotoalbum; does not support it until now. so if you want to avoid trouble, such as browsing your pictures, please buy a larger hard disk to store all the images on it.</seg>
<seg id="989">In the menu pictures you will find a submenu with the name privacy. if you want a little more privacy, filter the pictures so that at the end those remaining you want to make for others inaccessible and click Current View in the privacy menu. alternatively, you can also control all the pictures that your little sister can see, control and block the menu entry All out of the current view.</seg>
<seg id="990">With this you have set which images are to be hidden in case of the case. if you give the laptop to your little sister, simply select the menu entry Images to be hidden, so that all the images you have locked will be hidden. if you want to get the pictures again displayed, click on lock.</seg>
<seg id="991">It is also possible to set a password that needs to be entered to unlock the images. to set up this password, simply select the password in the privacy menu.</seg>
<seg id="992">Please bear in mind that this picture protection is by no means very safe. on the one hand, all images can be found on the hard disk and on the other, anyone who can access the file index.xml can read or delete the password as unencrypted text.</seg>
<seg id="993">The reason you spend all your pictures with & kphotoalbum; manage and spend hours about hours with it is natural that you want to look at them sometime. for this reason & kphotoalbum; via a picture _ and video viewer. you can start this from the preview as described in.</seg>
<seg id="994">The viewer can see you in. he obviously shows the image, but additional all the information you have entered through the image, such as who is on the picture, when and where was it done, etc.</seg>
<seg id="995">If the information box on the top of the image you want to see, you can simply drag it with the mouse and discard it elsewhere. you can also configure which information is displayed and whether information should be displayed. all of these options are available right-click on the viewer.</seg>
<seg id="996">Some words in the infobox are underlined. if you click here on the browser, see the appropriate entries to this display. so if you click on Anne Helene, the browser shows you all the images of Anne Helene. as if you had selected persons from the browser and then Anne Helene.</seg>
<seg id="997">If you have loaded multiple images in the viewer, you can switch between them before and back by using the image and down the image. you can jump to the first and last image with Pos1 and end. these functions can also be accessed from the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="998">If multiple images are loaded in the viewer, you can run them as slide show. & kphotoalbum; then loads a new image after a few seconds. how often it loads a new image can be controlled by pressing the Ctrl key and plus or minus.</seg>
<seg id="999">A very useful ability of the viewer from & kphotoalbum; it is possible to switch to full screen mode. in this mode the viewer uses the entire space on the screen. simply use the input button to switch to full screen mode and back.</seg>
<seg id="1000">When you use the viewer you can simply drag and zoom in the image. you can simply zoom out a rectangle with the mouse. with the Minus button you can zoom out the plus button zooming in the middle of the image and shows the result of the zooms.</seg>
<seg id="1001">With the point key, you can reset your zoom, so that the image is not shown zoomed. with the same button you set the zoom, so that every pixel on the screen corresponds to a pixel of the image.</seg>
<seg id="1002">Note that the only zoom operations that work with videos that are in and out with the plus and minus key.</seg>
<seg id="1003">With the rotation functions from the context menu you can turn the picture. this does not work with videos. you can make comments to the current picture with the menu item annotations from the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="1004">When you look at pictures it may happen that you find a picture with a person whose name you forgot to put on the picture. at the moment you can view this and open configuration dialog of the image to enter those names.</seg>
<seg id="1005">Another situation is that you want to send a number of images to a printer to get the pictures developed on paper. to see what photos you want you can start the viewer with the images and mark them as good or bad while you watch one by one.</seg>
<seg id="1006">For the two examples above, the viewer gives you the opportunity to view images with features while viewing them. features are the letters A to Z and you can make a feature by pressing the corresponding letter. in view a picture where the features A, B and C are set.</seg>
<seg id="1007">Once you have set features on your images, these are available to you in the browser. so if you print all the images you want to edit, print or whatever you have selected, just mark them all at once with annotations. this is described in. after that you can use a module to copy the selected images to a CD or whatever you want to do.</seg>
<seg id="1008">Categories and special features can be viewed in preview view. if you want to view categories in the preview view, then you can add features to the images by simply pressing the letter for the feature after the image has been selected.</seg>
<seg id="1009">Sometimes it is not clear what you want to show on a picture. in this case, you allow you & kphotoalbum; paint on the picture.</seg>
<seg id="1010">The batch is not saved with the image, but in the database. the way you can undo your painting later.</seg>
<seg id="1011">In the painting mode from & kphotoalbum; select on the painting from the context menu. to finish the painting simply press the cross in the toolbar at the top of the window.</seg>
<seg id="1012">To be able to work with & kpovmodeler; you need to use the program & Povray; not fully control, but the documentation to & Povray; should you absolutely read and understand.</seg>
<seg id="1013">In the object tree you can select individual objects. then their properties are displayed in the object properties and the object is displayed in the wiremodal views.</seg>
<seg id="1014">You can also select multiple objects simultaneously. but not the object of an already selected object, since all subobjects are already selected with the object.</seg>
<seg id="1015">To insert a new object into the object tree, select the position where you want to insert the object and click either the icon in the toolbar or select a menu item in the Insert Menu.</seg>
<seg id="1016">If there are several possible positions, the following drop-down menu will be displayed so that you can choose the correct position:</seg>
<seg id="1017">Deleting either from the menu bar or from the context menu of the right mouse button, you can remove selected objects from the scene previously.</seg>
<seg id="1018">If you have changed properties, click Apply to Apply these changes. if you have entered invalid values, a message will appear with a fault description. then you can correct the input errors and then click Apply or reject the changes with Cancel.</seg>
<seg id="1019">If you enter the path to & Povray; user documentation in the setup dialog, you can call the & Povray; reference to the displayed object with help.</seg>
<seg id="1020">You need the & Povray; 3.1g or 3.5 HMTL user documentation to use this feature. if this documentation is not included in your distribution, you can download it here. & Povray; 3.5 already contains the user documentation.</seg>
<seg id="1021">When editing a texture or part of a texture, you can see a preview in the property view.</seg>
<seg id="1022">Click preview in the property view and a small sample of the scene is rendered with the selected texture. as default, the entire texture is rendered, even if you want to render a part of the texture (for example a texture within a texture map and not the entire texture map), cross local.</seg>
<seg id="1023">The screen shot shows the control points of the camera. you can drag these control points with the mouse button and change the position and direction of the camera.</seg>
<seg id="1024">When a transformation is selected, the control points disappear and a small cross is shown in the wire model view. this cross marks the center for scaling and rotation as well as the position for shifts. you can change the shift by dragging with the mouse within the entire window.</seg>
<seg id="1025">Each object has a Visibility level as a wire model. you can specify this value relative to the level of visibility of the parent object or as absolute value. objects are displayed only when they are selected or their visibility level is smaller or equal to the visibility level chosen in the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="1026">& kpovmodeler; has a window arrangement as default. the object tree and the view of the object properties are shown on the left and the four graphic views on the right.</seg>
<seg id="1027">If you don't like the standard window order or if you need a different configuration, you can set it as you like. you can also store multiple window orders and simply switch between different arrangements.</seg>
<seg id="1028">To anchor a window above or below a view, drag the beginning to the top or bottom of a view. a rectangle then displays the new position.</seg>
<seg id="1029">To create a new column, drag the start to the right or left side of a view. the new view is then anchored to the right or left side of this view and extends over the entire height.</seg>
<seg id="1030">If you want to arrange several views over one another, drag the beginner in the middle of a different view. you can then switch between the views by clicking on the tabs at the top of the views.</seg>
<seg id="1031">The last possible window arrangement are floating pageviews: views which are not anchored in the main window. to solve a view from anchoring, drag the tempter to the desktop or click on the small arrow pointing to the left at the beginning bar.</seg>
<seg id="1032">To close a view, click on the small cross in the beginning bar. to prevent closing, click on the small square between the arrow and the cross.</seg>
<seg id="1033">You can insert additional views into the main window. in the View menu you will find entries for any type of views. new views are floating, you can anchor them in any place.</seg>
<seg id="1034">You can save the current window view with View Window System... to save. it displays a dialog where you can store the window order under an existing or new name.</seg>
<seg id="1035">If you have created a scene you can render it. & kpovmodeler; used & Povray; 3.1g to render, this program must be properly installed.</seg>
<seg id="1036">To render the current scene, click on Rendering icon Rendering on the toolbar or select the menu entry View scene renders.</seg>
<seg id="1037">Render mode matches the entries in & Povray; s ini files. it determines the image size and quality of rendering. if you want to render a scene in different image sizes and quality levels, you can insert as many render modes, from a quick preview up to full images of the highest quality.</seg>
<seg id="1038">When you click on the render settings icon in the toolbar, or select Render modes in the View menu, the following dialog will be opened:</seg>
<seg id="1039">Each render mode has a name. you can enter any name, but it makes sense to identify the properties of the mode.</seg>
<seg id="1040">In the map size you can enter the width and height of the rendered image. if you want to render only a small area of the image, select the check box subsection and enter the image section for rendering in the input fields.</seg>
<seg id="1041">In the combination field quality you can select the properties that & Povray; used for rendering. this goes from a very simple color and light model to a model with complex-diffuse reflection illumination. a detailed description of the render properties can be found in the user manual on & Povray;.</seg>
<seg id="1042">If an image is rendered with just one ray per pixel, different errors can occur. these images often have a moiré pattern or step effects in curves and lines, and sometimes details are not displayed when they are smaller than one pixel. this effect is called aliasing.</seg>
<seg id="1043">& Povray; uses a technique called anti-aliasing to reduce the impact of these errors. generally, pictures with this property look better.</seg>
<seg id="1044">When you turn on anti-aliasing, calculates and connects & Povray; more than one ray per pixel. this technique is called super-sampling.</seg>
<seg id="1045">& Povray; supports two methods of super-sampling. as default an adaptive, non-recursive method; adaptive because the super-sampling receives the neighbouring pixels. the second method is adaptive - recursive, because each pixel is split again and again because the recursion depth depends on the calculated colors.</seg>
<seg id="1046">If you select the first method, POV-Ray tracks a ray per pixel. if the difference between the color values to the adjacent pixel exceeds the specified threshold, then both pixels are calculated by tracking a certain additional number of pixels with super-sampling. if you set the depth value to 4, a grid of 4 x 5 x 5 (25) will compute additional rays per pixel.</seg>
<seg id="1047">The difference between two pixels is calculated as follows: r 1, g 1 and b 1 are the values for red, green and blue of the first pixel, r 2, g 2 and b 2 are the values for red, green and blue of the second pixel. the difference then is:</seg>
<seg id="1048">Diff = abs (r 1 -r 2) + abs (g 1 -g 2) + abs (b 1 -b 2)</seg>
<seg id="1049">The recursive method starts with 4 rays per pixel. if the difference between the color values exceeds the default threshold, then the pixel is divided into 4 sub-pixels, which are individually followed and checked for further subdivision. the maximum depth of the recursion can be adjusted with the depth value.</seg>
<seg id="1050">Another way to reduce the aliasing effect is the creation of noise for the beam process called Jittering. if you turn on ittering, change & Povray; the rays are a tiny amount to avoid regular patterns.</seg>
<seg id="1051">The final setting for the quality of rendering is diffuse reflection. this is an experimental feature of & Povray; which calculates diffuse light reflection. it takes very long to calculate a scene with this property.</seg>
<seg id="1052">On this map you can set whether the alpha channels should be calculated by POV-Ray. a pixel is then transparent when the associated rays hit no object.</seg>
<seg id="1053">Opens a new window for displaying the & Povray; -console output. if & Povray; unexpectedly terminated, you can find the reason for this.</seg>
<seg id="1054">To import a & Povray; scene, select the menu entry file Import... and select a file in the dialog box.</seg>
<seg id="1055">Currently supported & kpovmodeler; not yet the complete command range of & Povray; if error messages or warnings occur when importing, a dialog box shows a list of all messages.</seg>
<seg id="1056">If you do not support source code in & kpovmodeler; import, write this source code between the two special comments / / * PMRwBegin and / / * PMRwEnd.</seg>
<seg id="1057">You can drag objects from the object tree to the editor to export the source code for & Povray; this adds the source code of the object into the opened text file in the editor. to import objects to the scene, simply select the source code in the editor and drag it into the object tree.</seg>
<seg id="1058">Copying and pasting in & kpovmodeler; and in your editor you can insert source code for & Povray; also insert.</seg>
<seg id="1059">The POV-Ray command is invoked when & kpovmodeler; a scene renders. usually this is povray or x-povray.</seg>
<seg id="1060">If you click on help in the property view, open & kpovmodeler; the & Povray; user documentation on the displayed object. here, set the path to your document and the version. supported are versions 3.1g and 3.5.</seg>
<seg id="1061">& Povray; searches for external files (e.g. height field data) in the paths to the & Povray; -Libraries. if you include files that are not in the folder of the scene, you must also enter the path to these files here. if a file is found in different paths of the library, the first found file is used.</seg>
<seg id="1062">The color for the wire models. the second color is used for displaying the selected objects.</seg>
<seg id="1063">The color for the control points. the second color is used to display the selected control points.</seg>
<seg id="1064">The color of the rectangle for the field of view in the camera view and in the window type plates.</seg>
<seg id="1065">You can set the object size of the points to the grid in the context menu of the wire model views. you can set the grid separately for shifts, scaling and rotations.</seg>
<seg id="1066">Larger values result in a more accurate wire model and therefore better approximation for the displayed objects, but require more time to render. for some objects such as the ball, you can set the level of detail separately for two directions.</seg>
<seg id="1067">When you tick high detail fidelity for extended projections, all wire model views are further divided when the camera uses an extended projection. advanced projections are all projections with exceptions from perspective and vertical projections. this feature gives a better approximation for projections, but requires more time to render.</seg>
<seg id="1068">When you display a wall, a wall behind the objects is rendered. the wall is represented in a checkerboard pattern of two adjustable colors.</seg>
<seg id="1069">When you display the floor, a floor underneath the objects is rendered. the floor is represented in a checkerboard pattern consisting of two adjustable colours.</seg>
<seg id="1070">When you tick the edge smoothing, the non-recursive antialiasing method is used for rendering scenes. you can adjust the values for depth and threshold values.</seg>
<seg id="1071">This page allows you to change existing window orders or create new window orders. in the Windows Regulations section, we will explain how to create and store window orders.</seg>
<seg id="1072">The standard window arrangement selector: displays all existing window orders. & kpovmodeler; uses the selected window arrangement when starting the program.</seg>
<seg id="1073">The list of existing window orders displays all existing window orders. a new arrangement can be created with the Add button and deleting a selected arrangement with the Delete button.</seg>
<seg id="1074">Each window order is identified by the name. the name must be unique and must not be empty.</seg>
<seg id="1075">The list below the name displays all views for the selected window order. new views can be created with the Add button and deleting selected views with the Delete button.</seg>
<seg id="1076">With new column you create a new column on the right of the existing windows, with Unten you anchor the window under the existing window, with card card you will get a map map view together with the previous view and floating anchor the view not in the main window, but creates a separate window.</seg>
<seg id="1077">So you just have & Povray; and & kpovmodeler; installed and now you want to start without more detailed knowledge of the two programs. if you follow all steps in this guide, you should be able to create the ultimate but simple scene, among beginners very popular: a sphere on one level.</seg>
<seg id="1078">But you should carefully consider the following warnings before you complain that as a result, you only receive a black screen. if you use a 3D program for the first time, you should consider these important rules:</seg>
<seg id="1079">If you do not set a camera, no rules can be applied for rendering, as a result you get a black picture.</seg>
<seg id="1080">If you do not insert any light sources, your whole scene is in the dark and you get only a black picture.</seg>
<seg id="1081">If you have installed everything correctly, see the first start of & kpovmodeler; the following default window order:</seg>
<seg id="1082">Take a little time to get to know the menus and the existing Symbols of the Toolbar. please read the documentation so that you can get a reasonable idea of what you can expect from this program.</seg>
<seg id="1083">You will have to use these menus and symbols right now, so you should remember the menus and symbols and also their application.</seg>
<seg id="1084">& kpovmodeler; starts with a simple scene. to follow this guide, you must first remove all objects from the object tree. select the scene and then select the menu entry Edit.</seg>
<seg id="1085">The wire model view shows how the camera views the whole scene you create. in particular, note that in the fourth wire model view (right down). this is the view of the scene from the view of the camera. this shows you the result of rendering the scene.</seg>
<seg id="1086">The object tree now contains a new entry with the name camera. when you click on it, you can see the contents of the View object properties in which the different parameters of the camera are found. in the user documentation to & Povray, see more details.</seg>
<seg id="1087">Do not change the basic settings of the camera, this is subject to later guidance, but note that the camera in the view has control points with which you can change the destination of the camera. simply click on a control point with the left mouse button and drag it to the desired location.</seg>
<seg id="1088">When you press the Apply button or the Enter key, the wire model views and the object tree change immediately according to these settings. as a result, they see the scene from the view of the camera.</seg>
<seg id="1089">There are many ways to create the floor for the scene. for example, you could insert a header (insert final body shapes) and adjust the size to x = 100, y = 0 and z = 100, but that is a cumbersome method to solve this task.</seg>
<seg id="1090">& kpovmodeler; actually provides a simpler option. you can use an infinite plane as floor:</seg>
<seg id="1091">A good advice: select the layer in the object tree, change the name and then press the Apply button or the Enter key. in the object tree, the new name will be displayed immediately.</seg>
<seg id="1092">The wire model view now also displays the level, albeit at the moment only as a finite endental plane. if you render the scene, the plane expands to the horizon.</seg>
<seg id="1093">When you look at the object tree, you will find that you can unfold the entry for the bottom if you click on the symbol + in front of the object. in this case you will see only the default options for each new object: scaling, rotation and displacement. select one of these options, change the possible settings in the view of the object properties.</seg>
<seg id="1094">In this scene, you should shift the floor to the exercise a unit under the horizontal line, just to get to know some of these parameters. choose shift and set the values as follows:</seg>
<seg id="1095">First select the floor to adjust its material properties. there are many different materials, but at the moment choose something simple.</seg>
<seg id="1096">In both cases, a dialog opens in which you can select how the object should be inserted. the pigment will then be displayed in the object tree. you can change the name in the property view (Name = floor pigment), with a click on the button preview you see how the pigment looks now.</seg>
<seg id="1097">Of course, the pigment preview only shows a matte black material, because you have to re-enter settings for the pigment. therefore, always remember that you can preview the look of materials at any time with a click on preview.</seg>
<seg id="1098">If you don't see any color on the box and ball in the preview, just click on the Apply button and then enter the preview.</seg>
<seg id="1099">The material for the floor is now set correctly. if you render your image now with a click on the icon, you should get the following result:</seg>
<seg id="1100">Of course, this is not the color you expected. here are further settings needed. in the color list you have to enter two new attributes, called Unicoloured. then edit this entry twice (you can do this more frequently, but the board color list can be used only with two colors):</seg>
<seg id="1101">In the object tree, select one color each time and change the colors in the view of the object properties:</seg>
<seg id="1102">You should be able to carry out this step already, since you should have understood the basic working method of & kpovmodeler; the ball is just as easy to create as the floor:</seg>
<seg id="1103">In the view of the object properties you can immediately change the settings. set the value for the radius: on 1 (Don't forget to press the Enter key or the Apply button), so the ball has contact with the ground. otherwise, the ball would float above the floor as you moved the floor around one unit downwards.</seg>
<seg id="1104">Of course the rendering now results in a strange result: as you can see before, the ball surface appears like a matt black material. in the following step, put a suitable material.</seg>
<seg id="1105">If you have selected the ball, you can now assign a material to it. as with the floor, give the ball a pigment as color:</seg>
<seg id="1106">Select First subobject and change the name for example in sphere pigment. click on sphere pigment, then select Unicoloured and set the values as follows:</seg>
<seg id="1107">But you can achieve more interesting effects if you take the time to set some finish properties:</seg>
<seg id="1108">Then change the values as in the screenshots below and click Apply or press Enter.</seg>
<seg id="1109">The gloss effect and reflection already result in some good visual effects, perfect for glass or chromium-plated surfaces even if metallic: not even selected:</seg>
<seg id="1110">You should now have a good impression of what possibilities you and kpovmodeler offers; hopefully you have learnt so much that you can create simple but beautiful scenes.</seg>
<seg id="1111">Raytracytracing is a render method to create a two-dimensional image of a three-dimensional scene or model.</seg>
<seg id="1112">If you raytracing a scene, the renderer shoots hypothetical rays from the viewer's perspective (i.e. from the camera that renders the scenes) through each pixel in the scene. the render computes the visual effects of the light sources in the scene and how atmospheric effects such as fog affect.</seg>
<seg id="1113">As you can imagine, you will not see anything without a camera, the camera is your eye with which you look at the scene. without a light source you also see nothing, the picture is simply black. obviously, every scene needs to be rendered, some light sources and at least one camera.</seg>
<seg id="1114">In the usual file dialog, you can select your file. Povray files usually have the file extension * .pov or * .inc.</seg>
<seg id="1115">Opens a file. in the default file dialog, you can select a file that you previously created with & kpovmodeler;</seg>
<seg id="1116">Whenever you open or create a new model, the file will be inserted into this submenu and replaces the oldest entry in the list.</seg>
<seg id="1117">If you have already saved the model, it will be stored under the same name. if it is a new file, you must enter a name and disk space.</seg>
<seg id="1118">Restores the scene in the last saved version. all changes since last storage will be discarded.</seg>
<seg id="1119">This menu entry can only be selected if you still have unsaved changes in the scene.</seg>
<seg id="1120">Repeat the last undone command. you can only select this menu entry if you have used Edit Unusual.</seg>
<seg id="1121">Saves the current window order and opens a dialog where you can enter a name for a new arrangement or overwrite an existing arrangement.</seg>
<seg id="1122">In this menu you will find options for the setting of & kpovmodeler; here you can change the appearance, keyboard shortcuts and the default behavior.</seg>
<seg id="1123">Opens a dialog to change the keyboard shortcuts. you can use this option to modify short commands for & kpovmodeler; modify or add new commands.</seg>
<seg id="1124">Opens a dialog to set tool bars. you can use this option to add and remove tool symbols for & kpovmodeler.</seg>
<seg id="1125">A bump-map is a possibility to simulate rough surfaces without having to model each diffraction on the surface individually and without changing the geometric shape of the object itself.</seg>
<seg id="1126">It is common to use the same file for both a dump map and a texture map.</seg>
<seg id="1127">Basic bodies are simple geometric shapes that you can use as building blocks: very complex 3D models are produced from dozens or even hundreds of these basic bodies. these models are then further processed to give them a more realistic look.</seg>
<seg id="1128">A texture map is a way to give the surface of an object color on pixel basis, by applying an image file as a color card.</seg>
<seg id="1129">& kuickShow; is a comfortable image viewer and browser. the application has a file browser in which you can select images for viewing.</seg>
<seg id="1130">Images can be displayed either in a separate window in the size of the image or in full screen mode.</seg>
<seg id="1131">The use of & kuickshow; is very easy. the file browser lists the files you can use with clicking the & LMBn; or the Return key.</seg>
<seg id="1132">You can specify whether each image should be displayed in a separate window, or whether all images should always use the same window.</seg>
<seg id="1133">If you are looking for a specific file, simply type the first characters of the filename in the browser window. then a small input field appears in the lower right corner. if a matching filename is found, the file will be highlighted. you can leave the input field by pressing Return or & Esc.</seg>
<seg id="1134">In dialog box set - & kuickshow; there are five card cards. in three of them, general and editing and slide show, you can set the mode of operation of & kuickshow; in the two other, shortcuts for the display window and shortcuts for the browser, the shortcuts for the respective windows can be set.</seg>
<seg id="1135">If this is selected, the images are opened in full screen mode. if the image is not large enough to fill the screen, the rest of the display area is filled with the background color, which you can set further down. default is not full screen mode.</seg>
<seg id="1136">If this point is enabled, download & kuickshow; already the next image in the folder while you still look at the current image. this reduces the delay when you select the next image and is particularly suitable for a slideshow.</seg>
<seg id="1137">With this option saves & kuickshow; when moving the name of the last opened folder. at the next start opens & kuickshow; this folder in the browser window.</seg>
<seg id="1138">Click on the colored bar to select a background color. this is used to fill the background of the screen in full screen mode. if the window is larger than the image in the window mode, the background will be filled with the selected color.</seg>
<seg id="1139">You can set up & kuickshow; to set up only some of the file types that can display the program.</seg>
<seg id="1140">This option increases the display window to the full screen for large images. this option is turned on as default.</seg>
<seg id="1141">Determine whether the slideshow should begin with the first image in the folder or with the selected image.</seg>
<seg id="1142">To change the value, you can enter a new value in the input field or use the slider or the small arrows to the right of the input field. the default is 3 seconds.</seg>
<seg id="1143">The number of repetitions. if this value is set to 0, the slideshow is repeated until it is canceled by the user. to change the value, you can enter a new value in the input field or use the slider or the small arrows to the right of the input field. the default is 1.</seg>
<seg id="1144">Change the keyboard shortcuts for the different operating modes of & kuickshow; in the flashcards quick commands for the display window and short commands for the browser.</seg>
<seg id="1145">With this option, switch between the two-part view of the file system (a window for the subfolders and a window for the files) and the one-piece view of the file system with folders and files in a window.</seg>

<seg id="1183">The DCOP interface of Amarok has many common functions, which are mostly found in other KDE programs. this section consists of six parts and is intended to describe the DCOP functions of the collection, context browser, player, playlist, playlists browser and scripts.</seg>
<seg id="1184">Amarok supports command line options from Qt and & kde; additionally, Amarok has some custom command line options.</seg>
<seg id="1185">You should give the user feedback if the script cannot be executed because of a missing dependency. please check in your script whether all the required modules are present and use kdialogue to ensure that the user does not know why a script does not work.</seg>
<seg id="1186">Begin require 'corundum' Rescue LoadError terror = 'corundum (KDE bindings for ruby) from kdebindings v3.4 is required for this script.</seg>
<seg id="1187">In scripts / templates folder, you will find a lot of template scripts in many different languages. you can use them as the basis for your own scripts or simply expand them to the required functions. you will quickly find that writing scripts is relatively simple.</seg>
<seg id="1188">Using DCOP your scripts can exchange data with Amarok and control Amarok. the easiest way is to use the dcop command, which should be included in any KDE installation.</seg>
<seg id="1189">Most scripting languages enable the execution of external programs and commands. this is usually done using the exec () function. in this way dcop &gt; can be called relatively easily. here is an example in Python:</seg>
<seg id="1190">& Amarok; sends notifications to all running scripts. for this purpose strings are written to the standard input of the script. for this reason, scripts should constantly monitor their default input and react accordingly to events. of course, a script can also ignore the events if there is no use for it.</seg>
<seg id="1191">Configure White the script to display the setup dialog. to store and load the setup data, each script must take care of itself. when a script is started, Amarok settles the work folder to the folder where all data should be stored.</seg>
<seg id="1192">TrackChange signalizes that a new piece is being played. the script could now read more information about the new piece using DCOP functions (for example, the metadata or the piece length).</seg>
<seg id="1193">VolumeChange newVolume signals a change of volume. the new volume is an integer value between 0 and 100.</seg>
<seg id="1194">CustomMenuClicked: submenu itemTitle paths includes the path to the selected files of the playlist, when a custom menu item is clicked. submenu and itemTitle will also be passed to allow the script to identify the clicked entry. to remove an entry you can use dcop Amarok script removeCustomMenuItem (submenu itemTitle).</seg>
<seg id="1195">Before & Amarok; terminates, or when the user stops a script, sends and Amarok; the SIGTERM signal to the script. this signal should be processed in order to do e.g. clearing up data or configuration settings.</seg>
<seg id="1196">Amaroks script administration can also install script packages that the user has downloaded from a web server. such packages are basically normal Tar archives (.tar), which can optionally also be compacted with bzip2 (.bz2). we recommend an archive name such as .net.amarokscript.tar.bz2, so that the user can clearly recognize the archive as a Amarok script package.</seg>
<seg id="1197">& Amarok; 1.3 will only accept script packets with autorouting amarokscript. for this reason, you should designate your script packages right away.</seg>
<seg id="1198">The main script must be executable (+ x), the remaining modules should not be executable. use the Tar parameter -p to get the file permissions:</seg>
<seg id="1199">If your script package is ready, you can add it to www.kde-apps.org and attach the link to the wiki script page of & Amarok; appendix. for your entry on kde-apps you should use the category Amarok; scripts.</seg>

<seg id="1243">Amarok only needs the package kdelibs and otherwise no other KDE packages. you have to have kdelibs installed (including the programs included in it, because & Amarok; requires some of them to find e.g. modules or scripts). we have written a small guide how to make kdelibs minimal.</seg>
<seg id="1244">Some functions such as the OSD presuppose that your window manager will keep the relevant standards of freedesktop.org. Gnome will work, but fluxbox will work for example. we try to support Amarok on all platforms, so we use kdelibs and Qt because these provide an excellent development environment.</seg>
<seg id="1245">Probably one of your files will make an error in the TagLib library for days. you can locate the file by checking in ~ / .kde / share / apps / Amarok / collection _ scan.log. after that, you can report this error to the TagLib developer at bugs.kde.org and also hang the broken file that caused the crash.</seg>
<seg id="1246">Most of the time this is because Taglib crashes when reading the meta information from this file. please report this bug to the TagLib developers at bugs.kde.org.</seg>
<seg id="1247">If you use MySQL as a database, try SQLite. support for this in & Amarok; is a little more mature.</seg>
<seg id="1248">Make sure all libraries used by & Amarok have been compiled with the same compiler version. if e.g. & Amarok; with GCC 3.4, TagLib but compiled with GCC 3.3.X, this leads to crash when editing Meta information.</seg>
<seg id="1249">If you use KDE with artsd then turn off automatically when inactive for... in setting the sound system, or at least do not use a value of 1 second.</seg>
<seg id="1250">You can also send us the backtrace via e-mail (the email will automatically open during a crash). if it is a frequent crash and you send us a good backtrace, the error will be fixed.</seg>
<seg id="1251">This is because many programs write data as UTF-8 in the meta information, but do not mark them as Unicode. the following perl script fixes the problem.</seg>

<seg id="1272">If you use the GStreamer driver with the Alsa sink, the device has to provide a blender. a mixer allows multiple applications to use the device at the same time and simultaneously output audio. this can be achieved by a sound card with hardware mixer (e.g. SBLive) or through the dmix module for Alsa (software mixer).</seg>
<seg id="1273">The output of this command should help you find the cause and solution. for GStreamer, you may need to specify a different sink (e.g., osssink).</seg>
<seg id="1274">This does & Amarok; already. don't forget that media must first be decoded. you can't just send a MP3 to ALSA, you would only listen to a white noise. GStreamer reads the file, decodes them and sends the PCM data to ALSA. just like XMMS.</seg>
<seg id="1275">XMMS also decodes the data. GStreamer can output directly to ALSA, just as xine.</seg>
<seg id="1276">Use either the GStreamer driver (really great!) or optimize the settings of Arts. open control center sound & multimedia sound system. activate sound servers with highest priority (real-time priority) and increase the size of the sound buffer (warning, see next point of the FAQ!). make sure that artswrapper SUID is set:</seg>

<seg id="1326">Creating a playlist is very easy. drag items from the collection browser to the playlist. the small text field for filtering the collection makes it easy to search for specific pieces. if you are happy with the playlist, you can save them using the Playlist button. you will find this button in the playlist window toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="1327">If you have your own playlists, you can add them to the playlists browser. if the playlist is included in the folder of your collection, and you have enabled the option to import playlists, these playlists are already in the tree view. with a right click on a playlist, you will receive different ways to load the playlist.</seg>

<seg id="1331">& Amarok; presupposes the installation of some software packages. the required packages are listed below. in addition, some additional packages are listed which make work with & Amarok; more pleasant.</seg>
<seg id="1332">If you install these packages via a package management system (e.g. RPM or apt), you must also install the development versions of these packages!</seg>
<seg id="1333">& Amarok; is a versatile multimedia player. it offers many different ways to keep your music collection under control. like any normal multimedia player also has & Amarok; however, a playlist that's superior to all others. the playlist window contains multiple browsers with which you can capture and browse your entire music collection.</seg>
<seg id="1334">This chapter explains how all the functions of & Amarok are used, including creating a collection and a playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1335">The Player window is your one click & Amarok; Control Center. at the top of the window is a running text display showing the current piece or stream currently running. just below is the area, the playing time, bit rate and samplerate of the current play. a click on this area changes the display of the already expired play time to the remaining playing time of the play.</seg>
<seg id="1336">In addition, the Player window contains a selection of audio analyzers, including the running text display. you can change by clicking the available Analyzer by clicking the left mouse button on the area.</seg>
<seg id="1337">The & Amarok; Analyzer can be separated from the player window. press d on your keyboard and the current analyzer will be displayed in an independent, magnifying window.</seg>
<seg id="1338">The PL and EQ buttons are also displayed under the running text display. the PL button activates or deactivates the playlist window while the EQ button is used to set up equalizers.</seg>
<seg id="1339">The rest of the player window consists of the playback buttons, the volume control and the play position slider. use the sliders to adjust the play position or volume. with the playback buttons, you can start / stop playback and switch to the next or previous piece.</seg>
<seg id="1340">The built-in equalizer is simple and works with all audio drivers. there are 17 presets, from classic to techno, and you can easily create your own presets.</seg>
<seg id="1341">To view the equalizer, use Tools Equalizer from the main menu or click the EQ button in the player window. as soon as you select the Equalizer check box, the equalizer is in operation.</seg>
<seg id="1342">The Playlist of & Amarok; is the most sophisticated playlist of all available for & kde; available multimedia players. it has many features that do not exist in any other player. but don't let the wealth of functionality deter them, they are all easy to use.</seg>
<seg id="1343">The playlists window can be divided into two main areas, on the left side is the navigation pane. in the navigation pane, you will find some of the excellent functions of the playlist, such as the context browser. the playlist is easy to use and yet even for advanced users performance strong enough.</seg>
<seg id="1344">Context Browser contains three sub-windows: music, Text and Interpret. these three subwindows will later be explained in detail.</seg>
<seg id="1345">If you have already used earlier versions of & Amarok, you might notice that the subwindow has dropped off. the information presented here is now distributed in other parts of & Amarok; in addition, the information can be viewed in the statistics window (extras statistics).</seg>
<seg id="1346">The music subwindow displays information about the piece currently running, as well as the artist and the album.</seg>
<seg id="1347">The first area in this sub-window displays information about the piece. in the title is the name of the piece, artist and the album. below you see the cover picture of the album and beside it a MusicBrainz symbol. click on this icon to check the piece in the MusicBrainz database.</seg>
<seg id="1348">You will find more information about the current piece under the MusicBrainz icon. you can see here how often and when the piece was played for the first and last time, as well as its evaluation.</seg>
<seg id="1349">To view cover images in the context browser, the cover images must be in the same folder as the current piece. the file formats .jpg, .jpeg, .gif and .png are supported. the context browser will also display covers pictures that are either downloaded with the cover administration or embedded in ID3v2 tags.</seg>
<seg id="1350">The next section, Recommended Pieces, lists several recommended pieces. if you click on one of these pieces, it will be played right away.</seg>
<seg id="1351">Among the recommended pieces are the favorites of this interpreter. this section shows the five most valued pieces of the current interpreter.</seg>
<seg id="1352">You can specify which information to be displayed in the music subwindow. to do so, click with the right mouse button anywhere in the subwindow and select from the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="1353">The last section, albums of the artist, lists all the albums of the current interpreter you have in your collection. if you click on an album, it will work out and you will see the content of the album.</seg>
<seg id="1354">You can click on all the pieces in the individual fields to start playing immediately. you can also click on it with the right mouse button and then select one of the options for adding the part or album to the playlist from the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="1355">In the text subwindow the downloaded song text is displayed for the current piece. this feature is very flexible and it is possible to download texts from other websites using self-written scripts. as soon as you click on the text subwindow, try & Amarok; to download the text for the piece from the Internet. if you don't have a text script yet, you can choose which to start.</seg>
<seg id="1356">The Edit button allows you to edit the lyrics. the modified version is then stored in & Amarok; s collection database.</seg>
<seg id="1357">The Search button opens a search on google.com after the song text for the current piece (in an external browser window).</seg>
<seg id="1358">Group Interpret - group only the top level, each piece is displayed directly below the performer. albums or genres are ignored.</seg>
<seg id="1359">Grouping Interpret / Album - First the pieces are sorted according to the artist, and there will be another distribution according to the respective album. if you want to see combinations or soundtrack albums, this is the best view of your collection - these albums are displayed at the beginning of the list under Various Artists.</seg>
<seg id="1360">Grouping Interpret / Jahr - Album - Sort by artist and then after the year of the album in descending order (the latest first). if the year is unknown for an album, the default 0 - album name is related.</seg>
<seg id="1361">Grouping Album - All albums of your collection are displayed alphabetically by each other. the interpreter will be ignored.</seg>
<seg id="1362">Grouping genre / interpreter - your tunes are first sorted by genre and among them by artist.</seg>
<seg id="1363">Grouping Genre / Interpret / Album - This setting works just as the above but is additionally sorted by album below the interpreter.</seg>
<seg id="1364">With the help of the remaining buttons, you can customize and combine the grouping as desired.</seg>
<seg id="1365">With the last button you can change the settings to the collection. note: & Amarok; will automatically record your collection as soon as you change something to the selected folders. if you own many pieces, this might take a while.</seg>
<seg id="1366">A search filter is located directly under the toolbar. it behaves in the list view as well as in the tree view. critics concerning the use of this filter can be found in the section on the playlist in this manual.</seg>
<seg id="1367">There is a selection box under the search filter, with which you can filter the most recently added pieces to your collection. various time windows are available, ranging from the last 24 hours to a year. in addition, you can of course also select your total collection, whereby the filter is practically switched off.</seg>
<seg id="1368">By clicking with the right mouse button on an entry in the collection browser, you will receive the following options.</seg>
<seg id="1369">Load - This will empty the current playlist and paste the selected pieces in the currently valid order.</seg>
<seg id="1370">Attach to playlist - Add the selected pieces of the current playlist. by double-clicking on an entry you will reach the same effect.</seg>
<seg id="1371">Set pieces in queue - This function will add the selected pieces to the queue. this will be played next.</seg>
<seg id="1372">Save as a playlist... - Save the selected pieces as a playlist. you are asked for a name in which the list is to be stored.</seg>
<seg id="1373">Transfer to Media Player - Add the pieces to the queue for transfer to the Media Player. see the section about the Media Player Browser for more details.</seg>
<seg id="1374">Burn all pieces of this interpreter / Burn to CD - Therefore the selected pieces are sent to K3b and burned either as a data or audio CD. if K3b is not installed, this option is not displayed.</seg>
<seg id="1375">Edit metadata (for n pieces)... - Open the dialog for piece information and lets you change the tags for one or more pieces.</seg>
<seg id="1376">Move files to the folder... - Open a confirmation dialog. if you confirm this, the selected files will be deleted from your computer.</seg>
<seg id="1377">Mark the selection - Select the selected album as a compilation, whereupon it appears among various performers.</seg>
<seg id="1378">Highlight compilation selection - change a record marked as a compilation album back into a normal album. after that the album is no longer displayed under different performers but again under the respective interpreter.</seg>
<seg id="1379">The playlists browser makes it easy to deal with playlists. among other things, it also includes intelligent playlists.</seg>
<seg id="1380">The lower part of the playlist browser contains the smart playlists. these use & Amarok; s built-in database to automatically create some useful playlists at runtime. the smart playlists consist of:</seg>
<seg id="1381">Never played: a playlist with pieces in your collection that have never been played.</seg>
<seg id="1382">Also created intelligent playlists are possible. click Add Smart playlists to open the dialog to create a new Smart playlist. there you can enter all the necessary criteria for your new playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1383">The Media Player subwindow is used for connecting & Amarok; using your portable media player (e.g. iPod). to be able to use your iPod with & Amarok, for example, it must be mounted before starting & Amarok; in / mnt / ipod. if & Amarok; started, you will find the pieces on your iPod by artist sorted in the top list view of the Media Player browser.</seg>
<seg id="1384">To transfer pieces to your iPod, drag the desired titles from the playlist and let them fall on the performer list. when you're done, click Apply. thus, the pieces are uploaded to your iPod. when the transfer is completed, finish & Amarok; and resolve the drive connection for your iPod.</seg>
<seg id="1385">Under the toolbar, there is a search area with which you can search for a file. the search is especially useful in folders with very many files, because in the file list all files that do not match your search criteria.</seg>
<seg id="1386">In the lower part of the file browser is a address bar where you can fetch music from a entered URL. for example, if you enter tar: / home / mike / musi.tar.gz and press Enter, you can listen to music in the music .tar.gz file. now you can drag and drop the music from there into the playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1387">If the playlist is longer than in the window, the attachment of files can be difficult by simply dropping down. in this case, the holding of the Shift key can be helpful: this will automatically insert drop-down files at the end of the list and not at the mouse position.</seg>
<seg id="1388">The playlist retains all the pieces attached to you to play. you can change the order by simply dragging the entries with the mouse to the desired place. as soon as you enter letters there is only the pieces that contain the letters. to reset the filter, press the back button until the text field is empty again.</seg>
<seg id="1389">If you enter by spaces separate search terms, then & Amarok; search for entries that contain all search terms. for example, if you enter a two three, search will find all entries that contain one, two and three.</seg>
<seg id="1390">When you enter OR, search for entries that contain either one or the other search term. example: one OR two OR three. in this example, all pieces are found that contain one or two or three (or a combination thereof).</seg>
<seg id="1391">If you want to search for entries that contain spaces, then enclose the search term with goose-feet: Mike Oldfield. this will look for entries that contain Mike Oldfield, but not for entries such as Mike J. Oldfield.</seg>
<seg id="1392">If you specify a particular search column, you can also search for larger or smaller. for example: evaluation: &gt; 50. This is looking for pieces that have a higher rating than 50.</seg>
<seg id="1393">If you want to search for a piece that does not contain a specific search term, set a minus sign in front of the search term: -something looks for pieces that do not contain something.</seg>
<seg id="1394">You can combine these syntax variants as you like. example: Mike Oldfield OR score: &gt; 50 -comment: bathroom. this searches for all the pieces that either contain Mike Oldfield, or a higher rating than 50 and do not include the commentary bath.</seg>
<seg id="1395">You can specify the sequence number of entries by pressing the Ctrl key, and then click with the right mouse button in the desired sequence on the entries. the entries then receive a marking with a number. the number corresponds to the order in which the pieces are played.</seg>
<seg id="1396">The toolbar of the playlist is located at the bottom of the window. it contains buttons for some functions of the playlist. on the left you will find the Add button to add the playlist to the playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1397">Next, follow the buttons back and restore. this allows you to revert or restore changes to the playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1398">In the center of the tool bar there is a unique, magnifying analyzer. the refresh rate can be set with a click of the right mouse button on the Analyzer.</seg>
<seg id="1399">The last button in the toolbar is menu. it opens the same menu as that which you can view in the player window over the right mouse button. using this menu you can set up & Amarok; 's configuration.</seg>
<seg id="1400">There are many more available buttons for the toolbar, such as playback controls and volume control. you can set up the buttons displayed by clicking on the menu and set up toolbar buttons.</seg>
<seg id="1401">The status bar gives you a quick overview of useful information about the playlist. it displays the title of the current piece, the number of pieces and the total play time of all pieces. additionally, the status for random mode and recovery, a slider for the playback position and the playing time of the current piece is displayed.</seg>
<seg id="1402">You can also hide the status bar. to do this, disable the status bar flag in the general settings.</seg>
<seg id="1403">The context menu can be accessed by clicking with the right mouse button in the player window, or by clicking in the playlist on menu. using this menu, you can reach the settings of & Amarok.</seg>
<seg id="1404">One click on this entry will open the visualization plug-in window. there you can select the visualizations of & Amarok.</seg>
<seg id="1405">Behind this entry there is a submenu with shortcuts to this document and other information about & Amarok;.</seg>
<seg id="1406">The cover management is a useful tool for managing your cover images. you can start it by selecting actions cover management in the collection browser.</seg>
<seg id="1407">The cover management contains list view of all albums in your collection. you can view all albums of an interpreter in your collection by selecting the interpreter on the left.</seg>
<seg id="1408">With the View menu, you can choose what to display in the cover management. select:</seg>
<seg id="1409">The queue management received your big move in & Amarok; 1.3. with this function, you have more control over the playlist. after you have set a piece into the queue, the playlist will appear in the playlist. this number represents the order in which & Amarok; the pieces will be played: 1 will play first, 2 as second, and so on.</seg>
<seg id="1410">If you want to add a piece to the queue, select the piece in the playlist and then click +. you can also simply add the pieces with the mouse or use the context menu in the playlist. you can then change the order of the pieces in the queue management.</seg>
<seg id="1411">There are three types of dynamic playlists, two of which are already specified (the details to set up these are later).</seg>
<seg id="1412">Fill your playlist with random pieces from your entire collection and add other random items during playback.</seg>
<seg id="1413">Adds pieces based on load .fm recommendations (formerly: Audioscrobbler). this mode requires that some pieces are already in your playlist. you don't need a load .fm profile for this dynamic playlist to work.</seg>
<seg id="1414">Double click the desired playlist, drag it to the playlist window or right-click on you and then select Load. this way your current playlist will be replaced by the new one. so you should save the old playlist under circumstances!</seg>
<seg id="1415">The two pre-set modes Random Mix and Playlists mix instantly fill your playlist and you can directly start playing. the list of Recommended pieces starts with an empty playlist and you will need to add at least one piece from your collection. the recommended pieces will be added at the next piece change, so your playlist will be filled at the end of the first piece.</seg>
<seg id="1416">If you want to keep the current playlist, enable the last possible dynamic mode: settings Dynamic mode. this will use your existing playlist as starting point. using the same menu entry, dynamic mode can be disabled again.</seg>
<seg id="1417">The New Filters button fills the current playlist and adds new pieces according to dynamic mode. edit playlists opens the dialog to edit the playlist and you can change the appropriate settings.</seg>
<seg id="1418">Right-clicking on a dynamic playlist allows you to click Edit. then the dialog opens to edit the playlist settings.</seg>
<seg id="1419">Enter any name for the playlist here. however, the name should be unique to avoid confusion.</seg>

<seg id="1421">Pieces played - this is the number of pieces played that are to be kept at the beginning of the playlist. this allows you to easily see which pieces have been played recently.</seg>
<seg id="1422">This is the number of pieces that should be added to the playlist after each played piece. if you set more than 1 here, the playlist will grow continuously, because only one piece can be played and removed.</seg>
<seg id="1423">The right-hand settings have been described in the previous section. you can select from already existing playlists or smart playlists on the left-hand side of the dialog. if you tick several playlists, you will add random pieces from each of the playlists you check.</seg>
<seg id="1424">Some scripts make your own settings possible. you can customize the settings by starting the script and then clicking on it.</seg>
<seg id="1425">You can install new & Amarok; install scripts by clicking on the script. it will open a selection dialog where you can select a script package to install. after you have installed the script, a new entry will appear in the list. you can also install new scripts directly from the Internet.</seg>

<seg id="1470">Open the dialog to format a DVD. with this dialog you can format a DVD ± R (W), so the content is completely deleted. & k3b; lets you choose between writing modes overwriting and incremental.</seg>
<seg id="1471">The dialog asks you for a * .iso, * .cue or * .toc file as a data source that can then be burned instantly by pressing the burning button. (neros * .nrg files are currently not supported, but you have to use other tools such as Nrg2Iso.)</seg>
<seg id="1472">The dialog asks you for a * .iso file as a data source, which can then be burned instantly by pressing the burning button.</seg>
<seg id="1473">A previously loaded DVD video can be converted. this dialog box usually appears after reading a DVD in the content view, but can also be used standalone. it contains information about the selected video, encoding settings and even possibilities for changing the size and cut off black edges.</seg>
<seg id="1474">Displays information about the inserted medium. this information is displayed in the content view and contains properties of the medium, such as size and title length of the CD or DVD.</seg>
<seg id="1475">Shows a list of toolbars of & k3b; if an entry is selected, the toolbar is currently visible in the main window.</seg>
<seg id="1476">If this is checked, a small bar is displayed at the bottom of the window. it contains information about the status of & k3b; and its activities. if this is not checked, the status bar is hidden.</seg>
<seg id="1477">The folder view includes an overview of your folders and CD / DVD drives. if the content view is enabled, its contents are displayed in the content view. CD / DVD drives also have a context menu with functions such as media info, locks and unlock the drive or ejection of the medium.</seg>
<seg id="1478">The content view is also the interface to read and drag files into the project view. the content view is also the interface for reading audio or video CDs if a drive is selected with a corresponding CD / DVD in the folder view.</seg>
<seg id="1479">The header bar is a narrow area that is only visible when the project view contains open projects. the header bar has no real function, it looks pretty and separates the project view clearly from the rest of the views.</seg>
<seg id="1480">This opens a dialog box to change the key assignments for & k3b; after you have selected one of the available commands in the upper part, you can customize the keyboard shortcut for that.</seg>
<seg id="1481">This starts the k3b; Setup Wizard. this allows the correct permissions to burn CDs and DVDs. for this, system administrator privileges are required, so you have to enter the password for the system administrator (root) when you start the wizard.</seg>
<seg id="1482">Opens the settings of & k3b; here general program settings can be made. almost all functions of & k3b; should work immediately. this dialog is intended to personalize and fine-tune the program.</seg>
<seg id="1483">& k3b; is, like many other & small; -applications also, equipped with a & DCOP; interface. using this interface, parts of the functionality can be controlled via a shell script.</seg>
<seg id="1484">In order to use the & DCOP functions, you can either use the command line program dcop, or the slightly more convenient program Kdcop. both programs are identical in the range of functions, so your taste and the type of your task will be decisive, which of the included programs will give you the default.</seg>
<seg id="1485">In this chapter we assume that you use the command line program dcop. to use the & DCOP; functions, you must first make sure that & k3b; started. then enter something like the following at the console:</seg>
<seg id="1486">Besides the general & DCOP; functions all & kde; program have in common, supports & k3b; mainly two more parts described below.</seg>
<seg id="1487">The standard DCOP interface of & k3b; provides functions such as copyCD, format DVD and other functions for creating new projects.</seg>
<seg id="1488">DCOPRef createVideo CDProject () DCOPRef createVideo CDProject () DCOPRef createMovixDVDProject () DCOPRef createMovixDVDProject () DCOPRef createMovixDVDProject () void versionDvd () void burnCdImage () void burnDvdImage ()</seg>
<seg id="1489">As a result of such a createXXXProject method, you get a DCOP reference to the newly created project: DCOPRef (k3b, K3bProject-0) Alternatively you can create a project using the command line: # k3b --audiocd and then a reference to the project by using # dcop k3b K3bInterface currentProject. using this reference it is possible to change the project via K3bProjectInterface.</seg>
<seg id="1490">K3b offers the above K3bProjectInterface and the powerful K3bDataProjectInterface, which can only be applied to data projects (CD and DVD):</seg>
<seg id="1491">Void createFolder (Qstring name) void addUrl (Qstring path, Qstring parent) void addUrl (Qstring path) void renameItem (Qstring path, QString NewName) void setVolumeID (Qstring id)</seg>
<seg id="1492">This makes it possible to fill a data project with files and folders from a script. for example, the following script creates a data project, several folders and then inserts files into the new folder:</seg>
<seg id="1493">#! / bin / bash PROJECT = $(dcop k3b K3bInterface createDataCDProject) dcop $PROJECT createFolder foo dcop $PROJECT createFolder bar / foo dcop $PROJECT createFolder foo dcop $PROJECT createFolder foo dcop $PROJECT createFolder foo dcop $PROJECT createFolder foo dcop $PROJECT createFolder foo dcop $PROJECT createFolder foo dcop $PROJECT createFolder foo dcop $PROJECT createFolder foo dcop $PROJECT createFolder foo dcop $PROJECT createFolder foo dcop $PROJECT createFolder foo dcop $PROJECT createFolder foo dcop $PROJECT createFolder foo dcop $PROJECT createFolder foo dcop $PROJECT createFolder foo dcop $PROJECT createFolder foo dcop $PROJECT createFolder foo dcop $PROJECT createFol</seg>
<seg id="1494">& kaudiocreator; is an audio CD; -Readers for & kde; with it can easily be read and recorded in MP3 or OGG files. also other formats are possible, depending on the encoder that is installed on the computer.</seg>
<seg id="1495">& kaudiocreator; is the UI of cdparanoia (for reading & CD; data in WAV files on hard disk) and from many encoders that encoding these wav files (these encoders must still be installed from the Linux distribution). more encoders can be added to the program (if they have been installed).</seg>
<seg id="1496">First, the titles of the & CD; read out and saved in WAV files on your computer (lossless and compressed); and then</seg>
<seg id="1497">In a second step these wav files (usually one per title) are compressed into the MP3- or OGG format or even in other formats such as lossless FLAC.</seg>
<seg id="1498">For the first step, reading the & CD;, is used by & kaudiocreator; cdparanoia. almost every distribution has compiled a pre-compiled package; if this is not yet installed, this must be done now.</seg>
<seg id="1499">For the second step lame (for MP3), oggvorbis (for OGG) or other encoders must be installed. all these programs are usually already available for any Linux distributions, so it is probably not necessary to compile anything yourself.</seg>
<seg id="1500">Which encoding / file format should be used? the chapter Welcher Kodierer gives a small introduction about encoders, audio quality and compression factors.</seg>
<seg id="1501">A word to copy protected audio CD; s: as already said, used & kaudiocreator; cdparanoia for reading audio data from the & CD; this program is not intended to prevent any copy protection. if not the firmware of the & CD; / DVD device protects the protection, it is not possible to bypass any copy protection. simply avoid purchasing copy protected audio CD; s!</seg>
<seg id="1502">While setting up only once (the setup dialog can be called up until a suitable configuration is found), the daily handling of reading a & CD is explained on the hard disk. this (hopefully) leads to understanding the lean approach of the user interface that you will often stumble at the beginning.</seg>
<seg id="1503">Can convert into many formats - depending on which encoding programs are installed (MP3, OGG, FLAC & etc;)</seg>
<seg id="1504">Can & CD; get information from the freedb from the Internet or can work completely without a network, with everything recorded manually.</seg>
<seg id="1505">This is just a short list of the main window commands. step by step example, there are more information on how to use this program as well as screen shots with descriptions of tabs for the configuration of the program.</seg>
<seg id="1506">The CDDB requests the CD data according to the setup of request in the CDDB tab. (this may be local or online, in the latter case first the connection to the Internet must be established.)</seg>
<seg id="1507">Start reading and - when an encoder is configured in the encoding settings tab in the setup index - the encoding.</seg>
<seg id="1508">Opens a submenu with a list of available encoders so that the selection can be read with another encoder as the default. note that previously the encoder is configured in the Settings tab in the Setup dialog.</seg>
<seg id="1509">Opens the file manager so that an already read file is selected instead of a complete & CD; read and code.</seg>
<seg id="1510">Opens the setup dialog to configure the type of notification (like protocols, spepsen) for program events (such as reading the & CD; finished).</seg>
<seg id="1511">Open the main setup dialog by & kaudiocreator; with different flashcards (such as encoder, for setting the encoder). here you have to go before the program can be used successfully!</seg>
<seg id="1512">This chapter describes sound quality, encoder and compression ratios and helps you choose the right encoder.</seg>
<seg id="1513">If no audio information is to be lost, a lossless audio format is required. in addition to FLAC there are other like 'shorts' or 'monkey' that may be available for this distribution. the disadvantages are the low compression rates and hardly any commercially available devices that can reproduce these files.</seg>
<seg id="1514">Among the audio formats that lose information by data compression depending on their psychoacoustical model, MP3 and OGG may have a slight advantage over MP3 in audio quality at lower bitrates (up to 128 kbps), but above this bitrate differences are less important since both encoders generate very good audio quality.</seg>
<seg id="1515">O 'not so' free, lame is still supplied with most distributions for free, but there are open license issues</seg>
<seg id="1516">+ high to very high sound quality (at high bitrates), but slightly lower quality compared to OGG at lower bitrates.</seg>
<seg id="1517">OGG - if only music should be heard from a computer or computer based music system and / or if one of the few existing OGG playback devices is present.</seg>
<seg id="1518">MP3 - if music is also to be listened to on other devices, such as standard DVD players, portable devices (USB stick, memory card, hard disk) or special auto stereo systems. today - initially 2009 - these devices mostly support only the MP3 format.</seg>
<seg id="1519">A short list with parameters for audio quality and resulting compression rates for 'lame' (MP3s) (see 'lame --help' for more parameters):</seg>
<seg id="1520">'--preset medium '= This setting gives good transparency for most people and most music</seg>
<seg id="1521">'--preset standard '= this setting should usually provide for most people and most music pieces acceptable transparency, and has quite high quality. good enough for hi-fi stereo systems with high quality.</seg>
<seg id="1522">'--preset extreme '= 224 up to 256 kbps VBR, compression rate up to 6.3. needs up to 320 kbps for complex music pieces and less for less complex parts of the piece. good enough for hi-fi stereo systems with high quality. this is the preferred choice.</seg>
<seg id="1523">'--preset extreme -b 256 '= 256 kbps CBR, compression rate about 5.5. always needs 256 kbps for complex and less complex pieces of a title. some older devices need CBRs. good enough for hi-fi stereo systems with high quality.</seg>
<seg id="1524">'-h '= 128 kbps CBR joint stereo, compression rate approx. 11 128 kbps for all tracks of a song. good enough for music by youngsters, portable devices and autinkeogies. but not good enough for better hi-fi stereo systems.</seg>
<seg id="1525">'--preset Insane '= 320kbps CBR. this setting will be exaggerated for most people and most environments, but if you absolutely want the absolutely highest quality without regard to the file size, then choose this setting.</seg>
<seg id="1526">The & CD; information that is entered manually or fetched by the program automatically from the freedb over the Internet is available in the program as a list of parameters. you can commit / used with & kaudiocreator; and the encoding program to generate the folder and file name and the properties of the music files.</seg>
<seg id="1527">In connection with encoding programs, there is often a combination of program settings for the encoder and these parameters here. the manual or the help to the encoders explain the switches for these programs.</seg>
<seg id="1528">E.g. to add the & CD title to the keywords (English: tag) if MP3s are encoded with lame, the switch -tt from lame and the title parameter of & kaudiocreator; added. the result looks like this: '... -tt {title}...'.</seg>
<seg id="1529">This is a summary of & kaudiocreator; parameters that can be used (= button name in the assistant):</seg>
<seg id="1530">This is what the freedb is: a free database where people can read the audio CDs, download / enter the information, so that all others can download this information instead of themselves into the computer. it must be noted that here only text is spoken: & CD; Title, Artist, Names of the pieces & etc;, not from the audio file itself.</seg>
<seg id="1531">Yes, it should be legal, but I (note of the translator) bin not attorney. however, no one can prevent you from the & CD; information released publicly on the & CD; more or less worthless, so neither the artist nor the music company can be harmed. all information can be obtained anyway with a stroll through a & CD; business, physical or virtual.</seg>
<seg id="1532">In & kaudiocreator; is active to select a check box (sending an address). for the use of freedb can be used with another (fake) address than the one in the system. in this type of configuration, it appears, the email address will not be used when retrieving data from the server (This can only know the programmer who has checked the code.)</seg>
<seg id="1533">In many countries there are copies of the main database. if & kaudiocreator; to use freedb, the geographically closest mirroring server should be needed. this saves bandwidth in the network and balances the load between the hosts.</seg>
<seg id="1534">A visit to freedb.org provides a current list of mirrored servers for online retrieval of & CD; information while reading a & CD; alternatively, the complete database can be downloaded or (usually created monthly) only the updates of the database.</seg>
<seg id="1535">Which selection program is used to save Pieces from the & CD; in WAV files on my computer?</seg>
<seg id="1536">There are rumors that cdparanoia is used; who wants to know more precisely, search in the source code.... This has always been the best choice for reading audio CDs; see note that the cdparanoia package must first be installed from the appropriate distribution if this has not happened yet.</seg>
<seg id="1537">To save the read WAV files, the encoder and thus the desired file format can be selected. at first opening there are predefined entries for lame (MP3s), oggenc (Oggs) and FLAC (a lossless compression for audio data) on the tab to set the encoding. other encoders can be added on this tab.</seg>
<seg id="1538">The encoder package must be installed by the relevant Linux distribution before the encoder can be used. this is also required for the pre-defined encoders. more information about encoders can be found in the chapter Welcher Kodierer.</seg>
<seg id="1539">After installing a encoder, you can obtain more information about its switches by entering a command like lame -help or lame --help in a console window (eg; konsole).</seg>
<seg id="1540">This can have many causes. check the device name of the & CD; / DVD disk, read and write real on it and if both cdparanoia and audio encoders of your choice (lame for MP3s, ognic for Oggs, flac & etc;) are installed.</seg>
<seg id="1541">Check if you do not want a copy protected audio CD; check the envelope of the & CD; this will not succeed!</seg>
<seg id="1542">There is a chapter with a step by step example. even if you use other settings, this can give you tips on how to proceed.</seg>
<seg id="1543">Have you read the complete manual, understood everything, but are somehow still unsure what to do? well, no problem, follow this step-by-step example, and you will get enough information to set up those areas that make the program exactly what you want.</seg>
<seg id="1544">In this example we will start the program for the first time, set up everything and read our first & CD; we'll use lame '--preset extreme' to generate MP3s with a VBR (variable bitrate) from 224 up to 256 kbps in average and ID3V1 words (tags).</seg>
<seg id="1545">Both programs should be available as pre-compiled packages for your Linux distribution. an appropriate package for lame can be found, for example, with a search engine since it is considered not completely free software. anyway, it is not necessary to compile the source files, which you can always do.</seg>
<seg id="1546">Please make sure that the directory / usr / share / cd exists and that you own write permission (eg. trying to copy something into it).</seg>
<seg id="1547">The first section covers the basic set-up of & kaudiocreator; something that is probably only done once and</seg>
<seg id="1548">The second section describes how to read a & CD; what needs to be repeated for each reading & CD; it must be repeated.</seg>
<seg id="1549">Here we determine the encoder to use for compression of the music (lame) and the audio format (MP3) as well as the resulting sound quality (--preset extreme = &gt; VBR 224 up to 256 kbps).</seg>
<seg id="1550">Although we can change these settings at any time, we will probably not change it every time you read a CD; change if the appropriate settings are found.</seg>
<seg id="1551">The device name is handed over to the reading program so it can read the & CD; -data / pieces.</seg>
<seg id="1552">Often / dev / cdrom is a symbolic link to the actual device name of your drive. if this does not work or if more than one & CD; / DVD drive is present, a look at the file / etc / fstab and an attempt with the existing entries of the device names for the & CD-ROM; and / or DVD drives.</seg>
<seg id="1553">The map map General settings. there is not much to do here. here an additional conversion can be defined. in our example, everything will be left as shown in the screenshot.</seg>
<seg id="1554">Only select in case of incomplete information, so that you will be informed when information on creating keywords (tags) is missing.</seg>
<seg id="1555">The card card CD; -Settings. simply select both entries. we are comfortable and let the & CD; automatically download data via the Internet from a freedb machine.</seg>
<seg id="1556">Note: the computer must be connected to the Internet during the reading of the & CD, so that it can access the freedb server.</seg>
<seg id="1557">The second selection field is easier, a & CD; entry found, starts immediately the reading of the & CD; this is associated with low risk if you are later dissatisfied with the database entry and the resulting directory name / file name or tag entries, it can be easily changed. the directory name or file name is changed with Conqueror &gt; and the ID3 tags with Kid3, the & kde; Tagger.</seg>
<seg id="1558">Apart from this example, please note: if you want to enter everything manually, deactivate the selection fields and freedb will not be used. you can work with freedb locally in offline mode if you want to download the database before. however, if you want to use freedb in offline mode, the two selection fields must be selected, at least the first. the mode is set up on the following card card.</seg>
<seg id="1559">CDDB is for us freedb. these are settings for the data request, for calling the & CD; information from the freedb server over the Internet. how does the system know which data to get the CD? read the section about freedb.</seg>
<seg id="1560">Mode: we did not download the database, we only want to work with the remote database on the Internet server.</seg>
<seg id="1561">CDDB server: please go to freedb.org and look for a mirror server near you. on this way the load is distributed between the hosts. however, this setting will work as the first attempt.</seg>
<seg id="1562">Both work in the same way as the server is concerned, but because many firewalls buck the protocol 8880 by default, there may be more luck with the protocol 80, since the & HTTP protocol is usually open to surf the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="1563">In this example, we do not want to send data to the freedb server. deactivate the first check box should be enough.</seg>
<seg id="1564">Just take the settings from the screenshot. (make sure the / tmp directory exists on your computer)</seg>
<seg id="1565">Number of simultaneously promising pieces: sorry, there is one reason why more than one at the same time with just one existing drive? parallel reading and coding? the author does not know, therefore simply try himself.</seg>
<seg id="1566">CD; after reading the last piece: check this to check the & CD; at the end of the process.</seg>
<seg id="1567">Custom folder for temporary files: if you tick this, then / must be specified the path / folder where the wav files are stored. if the field is not checked, the files will be created in the private folder. do not forget this folder if you want to do something with the WAV files yourself.</seg>
<seg id="1568">Enter everything as it is on the screenshot. the command is a bit long, under certain circumstances something must be smoothed to the right to see everything.</seg>
<seg id="1569">'--preset extreme 'defines the audio quality of the MP3s. as mentioned earlier, this is a setting for very good audio quality, even for very good hi-fi stereo systems. the resulting bitrate is about 224 up to 256 kpbs. the achieved compression factor is 6.3. this is a good balance between audio quality and memory usage.</seg>
<seg id="1570">Note the '--id3v1-only' entry for restricting the generation of tags to version V1 / V1.1. 'ID3v2' tags may also be deleted if necessary. in case of a later change of tags.% f and% o are internal variables for the name of the input file (including the full path) and the output file (including the complete path).</seg>
<seg id="1571">Use the rest as shown in the screenshot. some comments for future use outside of this example:</seg>
<seg id="1572">Number of simultaneously encoded wav files: with a dual core or quadcore or even a multiprocessor machine can be attempted to encode more than one WAV file simultaneously.</seg>
<seg id="1573">That's it, we just finished the basic setup of & kaudiocreator; finished. this configuration is used as a standard for each reading of a & CD; if you have chosen the organizational structure of your music wisely, you never need to change it again.</seg>
<seg id="1574">This section describes how the process of reading the & CD; running on the hard disk. we will create MP3 files. the folder structure, the way the music is organized on the hard disk, was described in the previous section and set up. first, a connection to the Internet will be built since we are comfortable and the & CD; data from the freedb will need to be repeated.</seg>
<seg id="1575">Since we use a & CD, which is not yet contained in freedb, the screenshots look a bit different from the data collected for a CD; with successfully obtained from freedb data. therefore you will learn to enter the & CD; data manually, rather than pick it from the Internet. comments will point to the differences.</seg>
<seg id="1576">Don't try to find the & CD; it's a 'special' edition of the author of this manual.</seg>
<seg id="1577">If this has not happened yet, the & CD must now be inserted into the drive defined in the main window.</seg>
<seg id="1578">After a short moment the pieces and their length should be listed in the window, as in the screenshot. this only if the & CD; as audio CD; could be identified and read by cdparanoia.</seg>
<seg id="1579">If this is not done, consult the FAQ section for help or go back to the previous section concerning the basic settings.</seg>
<seg id="1580">Attention: if the & CD; successfully obtained by the freedb, all tracks are already filled out and the name of the artist and the album will be shown.</seg>
<seg id="1581">In the event that there is more than one entry in the database with the 'unique' & CD; -key for your & CD; there, a window will be displayed and you can select the database entry that will fit your opinion best to your & CD;</seg>
<seg id="1582">If you have not selected the check box for automatic retrieval of freedb (on the page & CD; -Settings in the Settings dialog), you can also manually trigger this by selecting the first button in the toolbar. if you do not have a local database, but retrieve the data from the Internet, you need the connection to the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="1583">E 1.2 Step 02: the CD editor - input of the CD data and the title of the first piece</seg>
<seg id="1584">Enter the data for your & CD; according to the pattern on the next screen shot. the title of the piece in the first line of the input field 'Current title', the rest of the data in the input field 'Album'.</seg>
<seg id="1585">The artist no longer has to be entered in the input field 'Current title' unless you have a collection of different artists for each piece.</seg>
<seg id="1586">The lower comment field can be used for individual comments to be individual per piece, the commentary box of the album is used for comments that apply together for all pieces of the CD.</seg>
<seg id="1587">Attention: after the successful retrieval of the data from the freedb the CD editor is not empty, but it already contains the data as shown in the following screenshot. however, it is always a good idea to check the content of the CD editor so that you are not only satisfied with the artist and album name (e.g. if all words start with capital letters or not...), but also to check if there are any undesirable comments.</seg>
<seg id="1588">Note: in this example, we use only ID3v1 tags. this limits the length of the fields to 30 characters for the artist, album and title of a piece and only 28 characters for the comment section. if you use ID3v2 tags, you have unlimited field length, at least on what & kaudiocreator; maximum allowed.</seg>
<seg id="1589">You can change the tag information of the generated files at any time using the tag editor. Kid3 is a good tool for MP3 files, with it you can also recreate ID3v2 tags.</seg>
<seg id="1590">Tags are not supported by all encoders or file formats. see the help of the encoder to get more information.</seg>
<seg id="1591">Simply select an entry that obviously matches the style of the reading CD; in this example, this is not important since we don't transmit the & CD data anyway. for more information go to the website of freedb.org and read the information about the categories. pop or Rap for example are to be found under Rock.</seg>
<seg id="1592">After choosing 'OK' you come back to the main window. simply click on the line with the second piece.</seg>
<seg id="1593">The window of the CD editor appears again and you see that the fields for the album are already filled with the entered data we have collected for the first piece. simply enter the entries for the fields of the current piece. the title of the piece in any case and other information you wish.</seg>
<seg id="1594">Click on the next line in the main window and proceed in the same way until you have entered all the title data of the & CD;</seg>
<seg id="1595">Attention: this window will not appear if you have downloaded the data from the freedb. it is already sorted into one of these categories of the database.</seg>
<seg id="1596">It is the third button on the toolbar. note that the artist and the album are displayed above the parts list.</seg>
<seg id="1597">Note that there is a check mark in front of each line of a piece. only the titles that are marked in such a way will be read. a simple click on the line switches the selection of the piece on or off. make sure all the pieces are selected, or press the All Pieces button at the bottom of the screen to select all the pieces at once.</seg>
<seg id="1598">By clicking on the Select button the selection process is started, this window appears for confirmation. click OK and then we will take a look at the window with the orders and track what is running.</seg>
<seg id="1599">Click on the tab order to switch to the job window. it is located in the left upper half of the window, directly below the toolbar buttons.</seg>
<seg id="1600">This is the window for controlling the orders. the first piece is currently read on the hard disk. the status of the program is displayed in the left lower part of the window in the status line.</seg>
<seg id="1601">This error message tells you if you are trying to work with a encoder you have not yet installed. pieces that have not been encoded successfully are marked with a red 'X' in the order list.</seg>
<seg id="1602">By the way, the folder for the TMP file and the destination folder are not what we have entered here in the example. did you check if you have write access to the temporary files and destination folders?; -)</seg>
<seg id="1603">Now it is clear why the error occurred right after the end of the first piece.</seg>
<seg id="1604">The order 1 reads the first piece, it is finished. but we have a new entry: assignment 4 is the encoding of part 1 into the format MP3. this means readout and coding in parallel. note the status message in the lower part of the window, it is now improved.</seg>
<seg id="1605">The author of the program has not found any configuration setting to suppress this behavior. the only thing that seems configurable is the number of parallel processes for reading and coding. for low-performance machines, the result is unclear.</seg>

<seg id="1610">If you are looking for help like the program can be adapted to your needs once it is running, then the following is true for you:</seg>
<seg id="1611">A program that calls a lot of different programs has many different settings. best read the step by step example to get to know the options and settings. it shows screenshots of the different flashcards of the settings and also includes comments for options that are not used in the example.</seg>

<seg id="1616">& kmid; is the MIDI- and karaoke player by & kde; besides others, he has real-time graphics and karaoke real-time highlighting of texts also some features that other & UNIX; -MIDI players have not.</seg>
<seg id="1617">& kmid; runs under & Linux; and FreeBSD. it builds on the OSS system, so should work on all systems with OSS and & kde; & kmid; also supports the & Linux; Ultrasound project driver that is needed for GUS maps. Alsa is included as soon as it supports a sequencer.</seg>
<seg id="1618">& kmid; displays the lyrics on the screen with changing color, making it easy to follow the piece.</seg>
<seg id="1619">Graphical representation of the activity of each MIDI channel by highlighting the pressed keys on the (virtual) keyboard.</seg>

<seg id="1622">Support. when you finish & kde; during playing a song, kmid will start with the same song next time.</seg>
<seg id="1623">Supports external MIDI synthesizers, AWE, FM and GUS cards (for the latter you need the LUP driver and gusd).</seg>
<seg id="1624">First, you can select Open... from the File menu. it appears the usual file dialog with which help you can select the desired song.</seg>
<seg id="1625">You can also drop a file from a & konqueror; window into the & kmid; this works also with multiple songs at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="1626">To play a piece of music, open it and press the Play button in the toolbar, select the input from the menu item or press the space bar.</seg>
<seg id="1627">Please note that & kmid; one piece automatically starts once you draw it to the & mid-window. (with several pieces, they are added to a collection and then played one after the other.)</seg>
<seg id="1628">As soon as & kmid is played, you can jump to any place by using the middle mouse button and go back and forth with the controller.</seg>
<seg id="1629">If you find that a song is played too quickly or too slowly, you can click on the arrows left and right of the template and change the playback speed. to get the original tempo again, double click on the Tempo- LCD.</seg>
<seg id="1630">The space bar has two tasks: when a piece is played, a pressure on the space bar like a pressure on the button pause or selecting the menu entry pause in the menu, interrupts the playback. press the space bar while no play is played, starts & kmid; playback.</seg>
<seg id="1631">Lyrics can be stored in one piece of music in two ways. some pieces use text event, others use lyrics and other lyrics. some pieces don't have any text at all: -)</seg>
<seg id="1632">In & kmid, you can set which events are to be displayed and even better: the event type is automatically ascertained, which a song is used, so you do not have to manually adjust it. so if you activate Automatic text selection in the Settings menu, the karaoke text will be automatically selected.</seg>
<seg id="1633">If you want to set an event type, select Settings / Properties from the Settings menu. the same function will also have the keys 1 and 2.</seg>
<seg id="1634">A collection is a list of MIDI files that you can summarize. these are played in series. in this section you will learn how to use collections efficiently.</seg>
<seg id="1635">To create a collection, first open the collection manager. you can find it in the collection menu under the item Organized.... Click on New and enter the name for the collection.</seg>
<seg id="1636">You can also copy an existing collection by clicking on copy and then specifying the name for the new collection. this collection will contain the same songs at the beginning as the original one.</seg>
<seg id="1637">If you have more than one collection, you can set each one in the collection manager.</seg>
<seg id="1638">The temporary collection contains all the songs you don't want to add to any other collection.</seg>
<seg id="1639">When you leave the application, this collection will not be saved. remember when you add many pieces.</seg>
<seg id="1640">To add songs to a collection, it must be selected in the collection manager. there you can add a song with the Add button. it will in turn appear the file dialog with which help you can select the desired song.</seg>
<seg id="1641">A second method to add a song depends on setting automatic addition to the collection.</seg>
<seg id="1642">When automatic addition to the collection is enabled, a piece is automatically added to the active collection when opening (using File Open or Drag & Drop).</seg>
<seg id="1643">When adding automatic add-on to the collection, the temporary collection will be activated and emptied when opening a piece. this collection will then be added to the pieces that continue to be opened.</seg>
<seg id="1644">To remove a song from a collection, you need to open the collection manager, select the collection and the desired song and then click Remove.</seg>
<seg id="1645">You can select the order in which the songs are played. if you select the row from the submenu sequences of the menu collections, the songs are played in the order as they were added to the collection.</seg>
<seg id="1646">When you add or remove songs or select random order in the menu, the order will be redefined.</seg>
<seg id="1647">To play a song, select it in the collection manager, or use the selection list above the karaoke text.</seg>
<seg id="1648">To continue a song, select the Next song, the next song from the menu item or press the arrow to the right.</seg>
<seg id="1649">To reverse a song to jump back, select the button Previous item, the record Previous pieces from the menu item or press the arrow left.</seg>
<seg id="1650">To delete a collection, open the collection manager, select the collection to be deleted and click the Delete button.</seg>
<seg id="1651">The temporary collection cannot be deleted. however, this does not matter because it is not stored when leaving & kmid.</seg>
<seg id="1652">This is absolutely necessary for synthesizers that are not General-MIDI-capable. in this case, the MIDI Map General MIDI events are translated into events that the synthesizer understands.</seg>
<seg id="1653">For example, you can create a MIDI map that converts all the events of the Change patch to Bright Piano type into events of the Change patch to Trumpet type, making a trumpet sound whenever a piano should originally play.</seg>
<seg id="1654">If you only have a sound card, you do not need a MIDI Map because all sound cards are GM-compatible (incl. Awe and GUS cards, FM equipment and so on).</seg>
<seg id="1655">Unfortunately, there are no programs to create MIDI maps. so you have to edit the corresponding file from your hand (with your favorite editor).</seg>
<seg id="1656">A MIDI Map is a text file that stores all the required implementations for playing a piece.</seg>
<seg id="1657">Each section may only appear once, except the keymap section, which may appear as often as desired.</seg>
<seg id="1658">Define PATCHMAP... END Define keymap "Name of the keymap..." END Define keymap "A more Keymap... END Define CHANNELMAP... END OPTIONS... END</seg>
<seg id="1659">You see that Define is needed to indicate that a section starts (except for OPTIONS) and END that the end of a section is reached.</seg>
<seg id="1660">Please send me your map file as an email so that I can provide support in future versions of & kmid; support may be for devices that are not General MIDI compatible.</seg>
<seg id="1661">This section shows how General MIDI patches can be mapped to your specific keyboard. general use looks like this:</seg>
<seg id="1662">Please note that the left side of the equal sign is ignored. it is assumed that the GM patches exist in the correct order (from 0 to 127), so you may not change the order and also leave no line for one of the 128 instruments.</seg>
<seg id="1663">The optional AllKeysTo M is used to lay all the sounds that this instrument needs to lay on the sound with the number M. if your keyboard is not supported for example (GM-Patch 127), you can take a drum (e.g. with sound 60), which sounds similar to a gun. add the following into the PATCHMAP section:</seg>
<seg id="1664">So if a MIDI file is supposed to play a note with patch 127 (gun shot), it takes patch 100 (the drum on your keyboard) and plays the sound 60, no matter what tone is in the MIDI file.</seg>
<seg id="1665">Please note that here with the term drum patch the patch is meant, with which each note represents another percussioning instrument (drum, cymbal, Maracas & etc;) and not the one in which the sound means the pitch of the always same drum (as some keyboards possess).</seg>
<seg id="1666">The keymap section is used to specify how sounds are mapped to a specific channel or instrument. the use is:</seg>
<seg id="1667">As with the PATCHMAP section, the order of the lines is very important, as well as their presence. so you have to create 128 entries.</seg>
<seg id="1668">You can define several key maps for each channel and instrument. you only have to use different names in the first line.</seg>
<seg id="1669">Keymaps are mainly used to map sound to the percussions channel. take a look at the provided keymaps.</seg>
<seg id="1670">This section can be used to map other channels to others. for example, if you want to exchange the first and second channels, simply make it in the CHANNELMAP section.</seg>
<seg id="1671">However, these settings are more useful for keyboards, which have the percussion on a specific channel (General MIDI on Channel 10, others need channels 16 or 9).</seg>
<seg id="1672">MIDI devices need 16 channels, the CHANNELMAP section has 16 lines, numbered from 0 to 15, built according to the following pattern:</seg>
<seg id="1673">N is the channel that is mapped to the channel N. if you use the Keymap option, the keyword will be used with the name name for that channel. if you use the ForcePatch option, all events will be ignored which will try to change the patch on that channel. in this case patch x will always be used.</seg>
<seg id="1674">For example, the ForcePatch option can be useful to always use the percussions patch on the percussions channel.</seg>
<seg id="1675">The value for PitchBenderRatio specifies which ratio Pitch Bender events are multiplied. if a MIDI file sends a Pitch Bender event with the value n, it will be converted to the n * (r / 4096) and then redirected. the value 4096 is used to avoid decimal commas in the map file.</seg>
<seg id="1676">This setting is needed because GM suggests that a keyboard that receives a pitch-benefit event with the value 4096 to play a tone higher. unfortunately, however, some keyboards try to play two tones up to one octave higher. to find the right value on your keyboard, you have to try a bit with & kmid; around.</seg>
<seg id="1677">To use a MIDI Map, simply open the MIDI Settings dialog. you can find it in the Settings menu, Settings menu.</seg>
<seg id="1678">The channel view is a window with a whole series of keyboards (one for each MIDI channel). on these keyboards you can see which tones are currently being played.</seg>
<seg id="1679">You can also use the channel view to change the instrument on a specific channel. for each channel there is a selection list where you can select an instrument. if you have changed an instrument, the button doesn't turn green but red to indicate that no longer the original instrument is used.</seg>
<seg id="1680">The channel view has (up to now) two different views to view the played sounds. you can select the view in the Settings menu under the point channel view: settings</seg>
<seg id="1681">The speed LCD shows the speed with which a song is played. the higher the number, the greater the speed.</seg>
<seg id="1682">You can change the tempo of a song. so, for example, if you find a song too fast to follow the text, you can slow it down. to change the tempo, use the arrows left and right of the LCD.</seg>
<seg id="1683">A MIDI file is a file containing information about how a piece of music must be played. it contains notes, rhythm, speed, & etc; thus, the same MIDI file can lead to very different results on two different devices, just like two different musicians can play the same notes in very different ways.</seg>
<seg id="1684">Well, I can't force anyone, & kmid; to use. but a typical MIDI file needs about 50 KB while an mp3 file needs 4 MB (a compression ratio of 1: 80) and with a good synthesizer gives you a similar sound quality.</seg>
<seg id="1685">This can happen if you have a binary distribution (rpm, deb) by & kmid; this happens because & kmid, compiled without AWE support. to eliminate the problem you need to download and install a source distribution (for example from kmid; 's start page)</seg>
<seg id="1686">I want to add a whole folder to a collection, but I don't want to add all the files separately.</seg>
<seg id="1687">Agree, therefore support & kmid; drag & drop. simply open the folder you want to add in & konqueror;, select all the files, and drag them to the & kmid; window.</seg>
<seg id="1688">First, enable automatic addition to the collection. otherwise, the files will be added to the temporary collection.</seg>
<seg id="1689">You can press the arrow key to the left of the Tempo- LCD to slow playback. to restore the default tempo, you can double click on the LCD.</seg>
<seg id="1690">I have a & kde; desktop a & konqueror; window with my MIDI folder and & kmid; on this desktop (when I play a MIDI file) or attached (if I want to play a karaoke file), just switch to the & konqueror; change the desired file into the & kmid window; drag.</seg>
<seg id="1691">If you only want to listen to a file quickly without adding them to a collection, turn the Auto Add to the collection, and the new one; file will be added to the temporary collection.</seg>
<seg id="1692">Suppose you have the MIDI files A.mid, B.mid and C.I.D. First you just want to play the first file. so set the automatic addition to the collection and open it. your temporary collection then contains exactly this one MIDI file.</seg>
<seg id="1693">Then decide to play B.mid and C.mid and create a collection of all three files. how do you do that?</seg>
<seg id="1694">These people sent me MIDI files or postcards. thank you very much! when I hear these songs or see the postcard, it animates me further to & kmid; to program.</seg>
<seg id="1695">& kmid; was written by & Antonio.Larrosa.Jimenez; from Maacute; laga (Spain). I am studying mathematics at the University of Maacute; I do not have much spare time for my hobbies but I try to take a little time. as hobbies, I have programming, collecting MIDI files, making music and prove propositions.</seg>
<seg id="1696">If you want to know where to download MIDI / Karaoke files, if you have a question, an error or an idea for an extension of & kmid; or if you just want to make me happy, send me an email: larrosa @ kde.org or antlarr @ arrakis.es</seg>
<seg id="1697">If you send me a postcard from your place of residence or a MIDI- / Karaoke file from a local group. if you send me a postcard or a MIDI file, I will enumerate (if you want). before sending a MIDI file, you should contact me, since I might have the file already.</seg>
<seg id="1698">I have & kmid; completely written in my spare time and no one gets money for it. I would like to stress that I am only programming because / when I get feedback from users (postcards or e-mails).</seg>
<seg id="1699">Takashi Iwai and Joseph H. Bühler - corrected the defect that the pitch of the AWE cards was too high.</seg>
<seg id="1700">My thanks also goes to Jose Lus Sanchez for testing the CIS support, Ignacio Garcia for testing the AWE support, Has Petter Bieker, Ola Sigurdson, Marc Diefenbruch, Peter Gritsch, Peter-Paul Witta, Thorsten Westheider, Ulrich Cordes and anyone who sent me a patch, error correction or even a supportive email.</seg>
<seg id="1701">And of course my thanks also to all these excellent musicians on the net, who give us these wonderful MIDI- and karaoke files.</seg>
<seg id="1702">In addition, & kmid can also be found on its homepage, which is located under http: / / www.armisis.es / ~ rlarrosa / kmid.html. on the homepage you can follow the development, search for information and view images. you will also find links to pages with other karaoke songs, etc;</seg>
<seg id="1703">A sound card. I recommend you a good sound card or an external synthesizer, since the sound quality depends essentially on your sound card. it is not the same if you use a FM radio or an AWE card.</seg>
<seg id="1704">If you don't have a sound card, you need to compile & kmid with the MODE _ DEMO _ ONLYVISUAL parameter. it then runs as if you had a sound card except that you can of course not hear any music.</seg>
<seg id="1705">If problems occur, please contact one of the mailing lists or send an error message directly to me.</seg>

<seg id="1709">The application window is made of so-called andockable windows. there is always the window with the central view. optionally, there is the window with the playlist. and finally, there is an information window that is displayed only when information is returned.</seg>
<seg id="1710">It is possible to save the preferred connections under the bookmark menu, but these are individual entries. if you want to create a list of entries that are played after each other, you should use the Category permanent playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1711">Of course, you can add groups to groups to receive an additional hierarchical level. if you select an entry, its group and all its subgroups will be copied to the current category and the playback begins with the clicked entry.</seg>
<seg id="1712">The categories' Current play ', TV and permanent playlist can also be changed by direct editing of the XML configuration files. of course, you can only do this if & SMB; not running. to do this simply click on a name of a category, select from the View menu and then the next editing mode. by clicking a subgroup, only the XML content of this part is displayed.</seg>
<seg id="1713">After changing XML files, you need to select playlists from the Edit menu and choose either Edit Mode, or select another category.</seg>
<seg id="1714">All changes are lost when the editing mode is left or another group is selected without matching the playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1715">As a result of the author's convenience, some features can only be turned on by changing the XML configuration files.</seg>
<seg id="1716">The animation during start and end can be disabled by editing ~ / .kde / share / config / kmplayerc and Change from [General Options] No Intro = 0 above option to '1'. if the option is not present, it can be easily inserted.</seg>
<seg id="1717">It is also possible to activate another animation. & SMB; will respect the files ~ / .kde / share / apps / SPlayer / FLV / apps / apps / SMEs / exit.xml; the format must be a supported XML file.</seg>
<seg id="1718">The animation at startup doesn't need to be short, it is automatically terminated by opening another source. however, this would be disturbing at the end-animation, so the user can finish the application a second time.</seg>
<seg id="1719">A simple example of a start animation can be displaying a favorite picture: & lt; smiled; & lt; img dur = "inar" src = "file: / / home / Koos / mum.gif" fit = "meet," & lt; / smilgt; / bodygt; / bodygt; / bodygt; / bodygt; / bodygt; / bodygt; / bodygt; / bodygt; & lt; / bodygt; / bodygt; / bodygt; & lt; / bodygt; & lt; / bodygt; & lt; / bodygt; / bodygt; & lt; / bodygt; & lt; / bodygt; & lt; / bodygt; & lt; / bodygt; & lt; / bodygt; & lt; / bodygt; & lt; / bodygt; & lt; / bodygt; & lt; / bodygt; & lt; / bodygt; & lt; / bodygt; & lt; / bodygt; & lt; / bodygt; & lt; / bodygt; & lt; / bodygt; & lt; / bodygt; & lt; / bodygt; & lt; / bodygt; & lt; / bodygt; & lt; / bodygt; & lt; / bodygt; & lt; / bodygt; & lt; / bodygt; & lt; / bodygt; & lt; / bodygt; & lt; / bodygt; & lt; / bodygt; & lt;</seg>
<seg id="1720">There is a tab for configuring MPlayer in the configuration dialog from & SPlayer; here you can set the path from the MPlayer and the cache size of the data stream from the network and other things.</seg>
<seg id="1721">Another tool for troubleshooting is the 'Console' button in the toolbar of SMEs. here is the output of mplayer.</seg>
<seg id="1722">There is no tab for this playback device in the configuration dialog from & SPlayer; everything needs to be configured by manual editing of the file ~ / .kde / share / config / kmplayerc, just like setting up the backend by mimetype. here is an example how a 'flash' is played with the swfdec-mozilla module:</seg>
<seg id="1723">'Flash 'can be played inside & SMEs; even the special field embed for YouTube can be inserted in the playlist XML.</seg>
<seg id="1724">To allow the & SMB; 'flash' to play in HTML pages, the & SME needs to be specified as a service provider for the application / x-shockwave-flash in the setup dialog file Assets of KDE.</seg>
<seg id="1725">The Konqueror or & SMB; is used in a console application and searched for error messages related to loading the browser module library. if there are no errors, the backend output is inside & SMEs; (view, console, or console from the context menu).</seg>
<seg id="1726">So that a given backend for a particular mime type is taken (of course only if this is also determined), this must be done by manually changing the file ~ / .kde / share / config / kmplayerc. for example, phonon should play all ogg files:</seg>
<seg id="1727">& SMB; can be played by TV cards, either via MPlayer or XVideo (this needs kxvplayer). before TV can be stowed, the device to be used and the TV channels need to be configured. for this purpose, the scanner can be used from the configuration dialog or the configuration file can be edited manually.</seg>
<seg id="1728">For configuring VDR (video data recorder) settings in the SPlayer, the dialog in the Settings under - &gt; Quelle- &gt; VDR- &gt; XVideo Port is to be used. there, ports should be detected (e.g. PAL for West Europe), the correct name probably has a dvd included in it.</seg>
<seg id="1729">Since VDR support for SMEs can only use XVideo, XVideo should also work (probably this type of playing video devices under Linux is the only one that works). for this reason, the videoforlinux extension must be functional for the X server. therefore, the XFree86 server must be included in its configuration file (/ etc / X11 / XF86Config):</seg>
<seg id="1730">Internally, SMEs are used for sources different names. at the time of the creation of this documentation, this is dvdnaval, dvdsource, exitsource, introsource, pipesource, tvscanner, TVSource, url source, vcdsource and vd source. if they are activated, they start playing the playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1731">Is there any clue how to make my CDROM drive quieter if I play from it (not from the VCD: / /)?</seg>

<seg id="1748">& kile; is an integrated & latex; environment for the & kde; desktop. & kile; provides the ability to use all & latex; functions in a graphical interface and within this a simple, immediate and tailor-made access to all & latex programs. finally, the easy-to-use wizard, the & latex provides and the powerful project management.</seg>
<seg id="1749">In order to learn more about & kate; and to learn its possibilities the manual on Kate should be consulted. users of & kile; can start there directly with reading the chapter work with the editor of & kate; start.</seg>
<seg id="1750">For & latex; is the correct language: lay-TECH. while the original & tex; difficult to use, can also use a layman (inlay) & latex; -macros. a less sophisticated but more realistic explanation is that it derives from the surname of Leslie La mport.</seg>
<seg id="1751">While here only a good overview of & latex is given, it is not the ultimate book for it. to master & latex, good books should be used e.g. H. Kopka / P. W. Daly, A Guide to & latex;: document Preparation for Beginners and Advanced Users, 3rd Edition, 1999.</seg>
<seg id="1752">Just like other markup languages includes & latex; an introduction with which the general properties like paper format, page numbering and text size are specified as well as a body with the text. the introduction contains at least the command\\ Documentclass, the body begins with the command\\ end {document} and must be closed again with the command\\ end {document}.</seg>
<seg id="1753">The step-by-step wizard from & kile; is a useful feature for quick creation of a document in & kile; the selection of the wizard (menu) offers a few options for the creation of the document. there can also be some settings related to the document.</seg>
<seg id="1754">Document classes: this includes the type of document to be created: article (article), book [book], cover [letter], article (DIN) [scrreprt], report (DIN) [scrreprt], projector [projector], projector [Prosper] or user-defined.</seg>
<seg id="1755">Encoding: the encoding of the system is set. modern systems are increasingly using the UTF-8 encoding as standard. at best, UTF-8X should be used (for correct processing of the & latex documents).</seg>
<seg id="1756">This list contains the most commonly used add-ons for & latex; for the integration they only need to be selected in the check box.</seg>
<seg id="1757">Article (DIN), book (DIN), Report (DIN), Letter (DIN): the document classes of Koma-Script (to comply with German DIN regulations).</seg>
<seg id="1758">New users do not have to worry about this. it is merely a brief description of the functions and further information is given in the section.</seg>
<seg id="1759">& kile; offers - just like other source code editors - the highlighting of the commands, settings and elements (as well as the inappropriate). by & kile, a simple problem search is possible (example): if you see larger areas of a green text on the screen, it is very probable that any mathematical environment will not be closed. however, it will save you by highlighting time and effort.</seg>
<seg id="1760">With the automatic completion of the environment, when entering a new command (e.g.\\ begin {command}) of & kile; automatically generates an empty line (for input of the text) and the corresponding line for closing the command (e.g.\\ end {command}).</seg>
<seg id="1761">All documents are usually subdivided into some elements. & latex; allows the subdivision of the document into the following elements (part is the highest and subparagraph the lowest element):</seg>
<seg id="1762">In the view of the document in the structure view, the individual elements can be changed and viewed by a mouse click.</seg>
<seg id="1763">When creating your own & latex files, the return search can be very helpful. as soon as a DVI; file has been created, bounces & kile; by clicking with the middle mouse button in the DVI; -viewer to the corresponding line in the & latex; -source code.</seg>
<seg id="1764">A DVI; file contains a description of the formatted document and also other information such as the font and is next to PDF the available output eart by & tex; or & latex; there are many tools for viewing, converting and for printing of DVI; -files for different systems and devices.</seg>
<seg id="1765">When using the summary search, the elements of the DVI; file are drawn with the editor and as soon as an element in the DVI; file has been clicked becomes the corresponding section in the & latex; the source search is the exact opposite of it. as soon as a section in the & latex is clicked, the corresponding passage in the DVI; -viewer is jumped.</seg>
<seg id="1766">Master document: this function is used when working with multiple files. with a master document, work with other inserted .tex files is simplified. when using a project, a project-wide master document can be set via project project settings.</seg>
<seg id="1767">Express: the & latex; source code is compiled and the result will be displayed automatically (if there are no source code errors).</seg>
<seg id="1768">File Monitoring: in this mode, the DVI; file is applied to the "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" and "" "" "" "" and there is no call from "" "" "" "" eyepiece "" "" "" "." "" "" "" "</seg>
<seg id="1769">When viewing the pane toolbar, the three large selection fields should be conspicuous. the selection boxes were developed for the rapid integration of the document into parts, chapters, sections,... The available & latex; commands for subdivision are:</seg>
<seg id="1770">The selection box Further is available for items such as keywords, knotting marks or references. the available possibilities are:</seg>
<seg id="1771">Name: with this command, a term for a section, a picture or other element is created.</seg>
<seg id="1772">Reference: is used for reference to a specified term (selection of a selection field possible).</seg>
<seg id="1773">At & bibtex; this only works if the file belongs to a project. for editing & bibtex; -files are appropriate editors. the author has good experiences with & kbibtex; and & kbib;. the & bibtex; -Files can also be written in & kile; by hand.</seg>
<seg id="1774">The last selection field with the name GrÃ ¶ Ã ¶ e is used for defining the font size. it can be specified the font size for the main text, the footnotes, etc. the following fonts are available:</seg>
<seg id="1775">When calling & kile, two choices are available: 1. the wizard for creating a new document by selecting the document type and enclosing the settings. 2. the document can be written by hand.</seg>
<seg id="1776">The brackets after the\\ Documentclass command contain the settings for the command. the setting [12pt] specifies the font size. if the font size is not set at the beginning, it can also be changed in the text.</seg>
<seg id="1777">Once the above source code example has been entered, the & latex must be compiled; the easiest way to do this is the use of the building or the button quick construction.</seg>
<seg id="1778">The source code must be stored before compiling. & kile; automatically executes the storage.</seg>
<seg id="1779">If the compiling of the document fails, it should be searched for errors in logging. if you are using quick-construction & eyepiece; it should be started automatically. if this is not the case, the logging should also be considered.</seg>
<seg id="1780">An environment (environment) is a text that is treated differently from the rest of the document. for example, a report with the font size 12 is created, and only a few columns should have another font. the command\\ begin {environment},\\ Huge and\\ end {environment} will allow the change of the lettering inside the environment to be called 'Riesling'.</seg>
<seg id="1781">The changes are only checked within the environment (from\\ begin {environment} to\\ end {environment}. there is no reduction (number) for changes within an environment.</seg>
<seg id="1782">There are many possibilities to increase the legibility and ease of use of the document. for example, certain fonts, bold pressure, passive pressure, substaffections, etc. can be added. these commands end either with the command\\ end or automatically at the end of the environment.</seg>
<seg id="1783">\\ begin {emph}: this command is for the italics and is long until it is closed with a\\ end {emph} or another environment. a single word in a set can be italic represented with\\ emph {word}.</seg>
<seg id="1784">\\ quote: creates a quote in the document. the quote starts with\\ begin {quota} and ends with\\ end {quota}.</seg>
<seg id="1785">After the background is displayed for writing the source code with the & latex; markup language, a step-by-step guide for the creation of a document in & kile is now followed.</seg>
<seg id="1786">Once a bit of text was entered in the wizard, a few adjustments should be made to improve the readability of the document. for this, a quote, a few digits in the fat and cursive pressure and a poem can be applied to see the differences between these commands.</seg>
<seg id="1787">Once the document has been viewed, the editor-view or Ctrl e will return to the editor (in the internal viewer). with an external viewer, the window must be closed.</seg>
<seg id="1788">Once the DVI file has been created, the document can be printed or converted to a PostScript; / PDF file. simply try out and have fun.</seg>
<seg id="1789">DVI; is a common file format (English D e V ice I ndependent). these files are created by & tex; or & latex; for readability of some drivers of the computer. there are many different types of .dvi output such as printer, & PostScript; / PDF converter or computer screens.</seg>
<seg id="1790">For the printing of a & DVI file, the same steps are necessary as for the creation of the document (see). at the 7th step - after clicking on DVI, the document can then be printed using File Print (in the viewer) (if the printer is set correctly).</seg>
<seg id="1791">The toolbar allows the conversion of the DVI; file into other formats. once the DVI; file has been created from the & latex; source code, the conversion into desired other formats can begin using the buttons in the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="1792">The default search allows the direct jump from the editor to the corresponding position within the DVI; file.</seg>
<seg id="1793">& kile; provides a corresponding setting for all & latex; -bindings. for this you just need to set up Modern under Settings Kile... Tools Build.</seg>
<seg id="1794">In order to execute the default search, the mouse pointer must be positioned in a line of the source code and then clicked on to select preference. the jump to the corresponding position in the DVI; viewer is then carried out then.</seg>
<seg id="1795">With this function in & eyepiece; with a click of the middle mouse button in the DVI; -document the corresponding & latex; -document from & kile; open and jumped to the corresponding line. for this you need to set & kile; in & eyepiece; in & eyepiece; as text editor (setting up the eyepiece... Editor)</seg>
<seg id="1796">Should an error occur when using quick-mount the & DVI; if there is an error, this will be shown in the logging file or in the message window.</seg>
<seg id="1797">The logging file explains the source code in the source code. in the editor, the knobs of the previous LaTeX errors and NÃ chster LaTeX errors can be used between the errors. the logging file always specifies the line in which the error appears. to view the erroneous line, the error in logging must be clicked and & kile; jump to the incorrect line.</seg>
<seg id="1798">Once clicked on the corresponding button in the toolbar, a window will appear to select the template to use for the document. the default options are:</seg>
<seg id="1799">When selecting empty documents, a document can either be rewritten from scratch or the wizard can be used to quickly create a new document. for more information, see the section.</seg>
<seg id="1800">High-level users of & latex; usually use the same introduction for virtually all documents. templates can be created in & kile; created, saved and loaded to facilitate the creation of a new document.</seg>
<seg id="1801">To create a new template, either an existing & tex; - / latex; file must be opened or created a new file. & kile; can create a new template by opening an existing document and selecting file template from document...</seg>
<seg id="1802">When creating a new document from a file new, some strings are replaced by other data (e.g. name or character encoding). these variables can be set up in Settings Kile... Settings General.</seg>
<seg id="1803">When creating your own template, it is necessary to know which strings are replaced by which variables:</seg>
<seg id="1804">$$DOCUMENTCLASSOPTIONS $$: this string is replaced by entering document class. typically, it is used as follows:\\ Documentclass [$$DOCUMENTCLASSOPTIONS $$] {article}.</seg>
<seg id="1805">The easiest way to create a template is to use the wizard and the associated command of the commands in the editor. once the document has been created in this way, the following steps have to be executed:</seg>
<seg id="1806">When creating a new document, your own template can then be selected instead of the standard ones.</seg>
<seg id="1807">A template can be created from any and latex files. if a simple way to create a template is used, it should be looked for on the Internet and the steps described below are carried out.</seg>
<seg id="1808">& kile; used & cates; as an internal editor. & kate; is a text editor for programmers with the possibility of reading and highlighting many different types of text files (including also & latex; and & bibtex;). many settings for & kate; can be done in menu Tools directly from & kile; out.</seg>
<seg id="1809">In order to learn more about & kate; and its possibilities to learn the manual of Kate should be consulted. users of & kile; can get there directly with reading the chapter work with the editor of & kate; begin.</seg>
<seg id="1810">& kile; provides a very practical & natural; -command reference which can be accessed via the Mention Help LaTeX reference. it contains an outstanding description of nearly all commands that can be found in & latex, and their syntax.</seg>
<seg id="1811">Double-clicking on the Ctrl key to choose the & tex; this means that in this way, when you click on\\ par\\ bigskip is only selected as\\ par.</seg>
<seg id="1812">When dragging the text with pressed left mouse button, the selected text is automatically copied to the clipboard.</seg>
<seg id="1813">When using the arrow keys with pressed Shift key, parts of the source code can be selected in the editor window.</seg>
<seg id="1814">& kile; has the possibility to search the most diverse types of source texts and highlight them. for example, the & latex distinguishes itself; -commands from the normal text and also the mathematical formulas are highlighted by another color.</seg>
<seg id="1815">Many assistants can add additional jump marks. this is a special type of bookmark within the text. the Mentions Edit HockCharts or the corresponding keypad enable the jump to the next or last jump mark. this is also highlighted so that it is automatically deleted when entering a character.</seg>
<seg id="1816">Editing is probably one of the main aspects of using a program such as & kile; although & kate; already excellent possibilities offered, were added in & kile; important functions for writing a & latex; source code always supported & kile; special commands for their selection.</seg>
<seg id="1817">Select a complete paragraph (group of lines that contain a blank line on both sides). this extended meaning does not include a text with persistent lines (as in other text editors). this extended meaning includes tables, & latex, commands and all other lines of the source code.</seg>
<seg id="1818">Choose the word under the current cursor position. this option also has an extended meaning, since this command also balances & latex; -commands with a back coefficient (\\) and an additional star (*) at the end.</seg>
<seg id="1819">To delete a part of the document, of course this can be selected first and removed by pressing the Delete key. & kate; offers the key root Ctrl; K with which the entire line is removed.</seg>
<seg id="1820">Removes a complete paragraph. the definition for a paragraph in & box; is included in the description to edit selected paragraph.</seg>
<seg id="1821">It has already been clarified that environments play a central role in & latex; therefore, & kile provides; for additional commands under editing environment for a possible simple work with & latex;.</seg>
<seg id="1822">With this command you jump to the beginning of the current environment (no matter where the current position is). the cursor is placed directly in front of the command to open the environment.</seg>
<seg id="1823">With this command you jump to the end of the current environment (no matter where the current position is). the cursor is placed directly behind the command to lock the environment.</seg>
<seg id="1824">If the cursor is located before or inside the\\ begin {area} command, jumps to the end of the environment (or vice versa).</seg>
<seg id="1825">When entering many nested environment commands, the survey can quickly be lost. this command will close the most recently opened environment, so that the nested environment structure will not be destroyed.</seg>
<seg id="1826">& kile; also offers special commands for the & latex groups which are determined by {...}. under Editing TeX group are a few important commands that correspond to those from the Edit environment.</seg>
<seg id="1827">With this command you jump to the beginning of the current group (no matter where the current position is). the cursor is placed directly in front of the graceful bracket.</seg>
<seg id="1828">With this command you jump to the end of the current group (no matter where the current position is). the cursor is placed directly behind the curly closing clamps.</seg>
<seg id="1829">If the cursor is in front of or behind the curly bracket of a & tex; -group #, jumps to the other end of the group (or vice versa).</seg>
<seg id="1830">In the input of many nested shielded groups-parentheses can be quickly lost over. this command will close the last opened group so that the nested structure of the & tex; groups will not be disrupted.</seg>
<seg id="1831">In & latex, two simple quotes are used as gardens. for the purposeful implementation is used in & kile; the character is used for two simple quotes. also for the completion of the application the character is used.</seg>
<seg id="1832">This automatic entry of double quotes can be set up under Settings Kile... LaTeX can be switched on and off.</seg>
<seg id="1833">You can also use specific settings (e.g. nauml or french) and thus German or French quotes. there are also many other languages available.</seg>
<seg id="1834">When pressing Shift; Enter key for & kick; an intelligent line breaks. if the current position is located within a list environment (e.g. enumerate or itemize), not only a newline but also the\\ item command.</seg>
<seg id="1835">Close & kile within a table environment; the current line with\\\\ with a close line break.</seg>
<seg id="1836">Even better - & kile; is intelligent enough to support pre-set & latex; - or custom environments. these can be kicked under Settings; Set Up... LaTeX to be added.</seg>
<seg id="1837">Some users want to arrange columns in tables environment and thereby all Et characters (amp;) among each other. & kile; tries to enable this. when pressing Shift; Alt; amp; searches & kile; after the next tab is added, add & kick; add some space for the column position of the current tabulator.</seg>
<seg id="1838">Although & kate; already offers a good source code completion, it has been added in & kile; in order to add special commands (mostly for & latex). three of these work on demand and the other two are for automatic completion. all of these modes can be set for different modes of work under Settings Kile... fully customizable.</seg>
<seg id="1839">Start a new environment using the\\ begin {area} command; automatically add the\\ end {area} command after an empty line (for the text).</seg>
<seg id="1840">When pressing the back button, the last letter of the input will be removed and it is possible to change the complete list. on the other hand, the list can also be reduced by entering another letter.</seg>
<seg id="1841">All commands are written with a short description of their parameters. alternatively, the descriptions are removed by selecting a command. alternatively, from & kile; even hocks can be inserted, so that an easy jump to these positions can be possible using the Edit Domain NÃ chest jump mark and then the desired parameters can then be added.</seg>
<seg id="1842">Under Settings box; set up... kile; complete can be made to these lists. there can be various wishes lists for & tex; - and & latex; -commands as well as wishes of the general language use.</seg>
<seg id="1843">The command mode is not useful for the completion of environments. there must always be a few letters with\\ begin to be entered and the call to complete mode will result in a large list of environment commands. on the other hand, the environments are used so often that & kile; a special mode for the completion of the environments available.</seg>
<seg id="1844">When calling the completed environment or the Alt + Shift key, the command to open the environment is automatically opened and it will appear\\ begin. after that, the environment can be continued in the simplest way and ended by pressing the input key.</seg>
<seg id="1845">Once this has been done, the environment is automatically closed again. as soon as & kile; recognize that it is a list environment, even a first\\ item command will be added.</seg>
<seg id="1846">Under Settings box; set up... kile; complete settings can be made to these lists. this mode uses the list of disable mode for & tex; - and & latex; -commands.</seg>
<seg id="1847">& kile; supports custom lists of abbreviations which are immediately replaced by longer strings. the lists can be set up under Settings Kile... Kile can be executed fully. as an example of a query list, the file example.cwl, in which for example the entry L =\\ LaTeX is included.</seg>
<seg id="1848">For example, the letter L is entered and the word processor mode implemented over the menu processing or pressing Ctrl + Alt key-key, the letter L is replaced by the character string\\ LaTeX.</seg>
<seg id="1849">Large quests are not helpful for automatic completion. however, it has been found that many users are written more than once in a document. thus, & kile offers; the complete termination for all already written wishes.</seg>
<seg id="1850">This mode can be set up in the box Settings Kile... Kile can be deprecated. here, the treshold for the display of the complete damage can also be specified.</seg>
<seg id="1851">The complete files can be installed in the ~ / .kde / share / apps / kile / complete / mode / the Persian home folder. mode stands for Abbreviation, Dictionary (WÃ ¶ rterbuch) or tex.</seg>
<seg id="1852">The graphics capture graphics make it as easy as possible to insert graphics. to view the basics of graphic formats, the sections should be considered.</seg>
<seg id="1853">PS files are not as well known as PDF files but provide an excellent basis for changes and new orders of pages. if the PDF output is required, the pages can be rearranged with a few & PostScript; tools and then converted to a PDF file with ps2pdf.</seg>
<seg id="1854">In order to examine the results of the work, the source code must be compiled. all construction tools are compiled in groups in the menu Create compiling, converting and creating views.</seg>
<seg id="1855">For compiling the source text for viewers such as & eyepiece; or the further conversion can be used the key element Alt; 2. afterwards, the DVI; file can be viewed in the default viewer by Alt; 3, by means of Alt; 4 the DVI; file can be converted to a PS file and viewed by Alt; 5 the PS file.</seg>
<seg id="1856">When using the Schnellbau command, a viewer is normally called after compiling. if no embedded viewer is used, a new window will be opened each time.</seg>
<seg id="1857">A new project will be discussed about the Project New Project.... In this case the following information is requested for the project:</seg>
<seg id="1858">When executing the filename window, the relative path must be specified by the .kiler project file.</seg>
<seg id="1859">The script function of & kile; allows executing ECMAScript codes. scripts can be managed through scripts in the vertical bar.</seg>
<seg id="1860">The API scripts are not yet developed and can be modified in other versions of & kile.</seg>
<seg id="1861">First, it must be said that the execution environment of the scripts in & kile; a system-wide object (= kile) with the following methods has:</seg>
<seg id="1862">& latex; is a fairly declared system in which the basic functions can be extended by a variety of additional packages. & kile; offers a lot of different help to support the users.</seg>
<seg id="1863">& tetex; and & texlive; are supplied with many documents. this includes a documentation for the included packages and an additional & latex; -reference.</seg>
<seg id="1864">A complete Refernz for & tex; and its name-to-yourname. it is not just a description of all programs (but a few important packets are described) but rather is a complete instruction manual for the & latex; this is a very large document, it is divided into three important bookmarks.</seg>
<seg id="1865">Due to the quantity of documents with which & tetex; / texlive; delivered, finding the right document is not always easy. as possible help offers & tetex; / texlive; the small application text doctk, which contains a database with all documents and for a graphical surface area.</seg>
<seg id="1866">All documents are divided into categories and the great advantage is the search for package names or keywords.</seg>
<seg id="1867">Double-clicking with the mouse or pressing the space bar opens the viewer for the document.</seg>
<seg id="1868">& kile; is a quelloff and user-friendly & latex; - / tex; -Source editor that can be executed on all systems with installed & kde; - and Unix-like systems. & kile; is also part of the Fink project, whereby & kile; also on & Mac; with installed OS X can be executed.</seg>

<seg id="1929">The plug-ins, the & quantaplus; laths, have with & quantaplus; even possibly little to do. this makes the plugin system very powerful. you can benefit from additional functionality immediately and do not have to wait until someone is plugging in & quantaplus; plugins can be used in a large number of & GUI elements.</seg>
<seg id="1930">To install a plugin or a part, we start with the Edit menu. this will open the following dialog:</seg>
<seg id="1931">This dialog allows you to manage all contained plug-ins and add new ones. we describe each & GUI; element in it:</seg>
<seg id="1932">Here you can enter the search path. when adding plugins without a storage location uses & quantaplus; this path to search the plug-in.</seg>
<seg id="1933">Often on a project several people work in a kind of hierarchical relationship to each other. & quantaplus; supports the specification of team members and these can be configured with Shift; F7 Project Project Properties dialog.</seg>
<seg id="1934">The name and email entries are self-explanatory. nickname is the nickname of the user and is used for unique identification.</seg>
<seg id="1935">A member can have several roles in the project, such as team leaders and sub-project leaders.</seg>
<seg id="1936">The user can choose from the list of team members who he is. this happens by searching the team member from the list and pushes the Setze + button. the currently selected member (their identity) appears bold after you are: text.</seg>
<seg id="1937">Nicknames and the attitude of their own identity are important in terms of messages and comments. see for further information on annotations.</seg>
<seg id="1938">In addition to an overview of their team there is another advantage by capturing members of the team: an event can be created for information to the team leader when something is happening. see for more information.</seg>
<seg id="1939">Event actions are actions that are executed when something specific happens in the project. an example would be recording the opening and closing of the project, so that later can be seen how much someone worked on it, or sending a message when a file is backed up, or a script that enters a file into CVS once it is added to the project & etc;</seg>
<seg id="1940">On the page Event configuration of the Shift; F7 Project Project Settings dialog, events can be created, edited and deleted.</seg>
<seg id="1941">An email will be sent to the addressee in the recipient list. the addressee may be a team or sub-project leader.</seg>
<seg id="1942">Notes are special comments in the documents. they differ from normal comments by the following:</seg>
<seg id="1943">Enter comments is simple. it can either select the note entry from the editor context menu or enter the @ annotation keyword in a comment field followed by comment text.</seg>
<seg id="1944">Notes can be sent to a certain member of the team. in this case, the syntax @ annotation (nickname) or @ annotation (role) is a role in the project from the following options: team Leader Subproject Leader after the area and sub-project leaders should be given the corresponding range or subproject names, as shown in the following examples below.</seg>

<seg id="1948">The settings can be set up using the Quanta settings... This dialog extends over some pages that are treated one after the other.</seg>
<seg id="1949">The behavior of & quantaplus; regarding tags, including car completion, can be changed with this. the entries are:</seg>
<seg id="1950">Large / lowercase of tags: large / lowercase of automatically inserted tags. normal sized / lowercase means tags are inserted in such a way as they are described in the tag XML files.</seg>
<seg id="1951">Large / lowercase of attributes: large / lowercase of automatically inserted attributes. normal sized / lowercase means the attributes are inserted in such a way as described in the tagXML files.</seg>
<seg id="1952">Optional Tags: if checked, tags for which the closing tag is optional, will be added immediately after & gt;</seg>
<seg id="1953">Do not include optional tags: as above, for all other tags with the exception of simple tags.</seg>
<seg id="1954">Update start and end day automatically: if enabled, the corresponding closing tag will be changed and vice versa.</seg>
<seg id="1955">Automatic setting of accent characters: controls the automatic conversion of accented characters into the corresponding coding during typing.</seg>
<seg id="1956">MIME types: mimetypes for detection of different types of files. the default setting can be restored using the Standard button.</seg>
<seg id="1957">Default character encoding: the encoding of newly created or otherwise opened files (where the encoding of the file can be skipped). however, this setting here will be ejected from the same in the project features if a project is loaded.</seg>
<seg id="1958">Standard DTD: the selected DTD is used for newly created files, or for files whose DTD has not been detected. however, this setting here will be dropped by the same in the project properties if a project is loaded.</seg>
<seg id="1959">Create a backup copy: & quantaplus; creates backup copies regularly so that during a power failure or crash, the document can be recovered from this backup at the next start of the program. this is not the same as saving the file. also for unsaved documents a backup will be created regularly, according to the set time.</seg>
<seg id="1960">The preview and documentation can be displayed either in the Editor area or in your own view (or the documentation in a tab), making it possible to preview the documentation, preview and source text at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="1961">Reset the window settings to the default at the next start is useful when the user interface has been messed up by changing the MDI modes and docking / appending of views. it corresponds to the --resetlayout command line parameter.</seg>
<seg id="1962">The alert notification area is used to control the display of warnings by enabling no more questions.</seg>
<seg id="1963">The location to change behavior of & VPL; it can be set the display of symbols instead of scripts as well as the synchronization behavior of the VPL- and the source text view in split mode.</seg>
<seg id="1964">Here the parser and the structure tree, representing the illustration of the parser nodes in the document, can be adjusted in detail.</seg>
<seg id="1965">In the mouse click on the structure tree, the following action is possible to change the action triggered by clicking the structure tree with the mouse buttons.</seg>
<seg id="1966">In the Structural Tree Settings section, the visibility of nodes in the tree, the updating frequency of the tree when editing and how deeply should be opened automatically with a change in the structure tree. empty nodes are the empty areas in the text, while empty groups are those in which no element has been found in the current document.</seg>
<seg id="1967">Abbreviations are divided into groups, each can be valid for several & DTEP; s. this means that there can be a valid group for PHP, in which the ifclause shortcut means something else than in a group valid for Javascript.</seg>
<seg id="1968">Plugins are part-applications from third parties, which can be re-used by any part-capable application, the most known & konqueror; when inserting a plug-in, the following must be specified:</seg>
<seg id="1969">Address: the path to the plugin if it is not on a standard like $KDEDIR / lib.</seg>
<seg id="1970">Input: this information is passed to the plugin at startup, so it can open the current file, the corresponding folder (path of the current file) or the project folder.</seg>
<seg id="1971">Load the component in the "read-only" mode: check if the plugin refuses to load the load. only-Read-KParts normally refuse loading if this option is not selected.</seg>
<seg id="1972">Check the plugin: if this is activated, test & quantaplus; if the entered information is correct. choose to save the entry even if the plugin is not available at the moment, but it should be installed later.</seg>
<seg id="1973">For & quantaplus; as of version 3.3, debugging has been completely redeveloped. support for the no more necessary built-in & PHP; (3) debugger has been set, as well as support for the DBG debugger. instead, a debugger plug-in concept has been implemented that allows different implementations about plug-ins.</seg>
<seg id="1974">Currently, only one plugin is available, support for the use of & gubed; inquantaplus; inserts.</seg>
<seg id="1975">The use of the debugger for a project starts with the selection of a suitable debugger plug-in in the project settings. with the Options button next to the debugger plug-in selection field, the specific settings can be changed.</seg>
<seg id="1976">If a debugger is activated for a project, some additional elements appear in the & quantaplus; user interface:</seg>
<seg id="1977">A view where the contents of monitored variables are displayed. usually appears in the left dock.</seg>
<seg id="1978">A view where all stops are listed, with line numbers and conditions. usually appears in the bottom dock.</seg>
<seg id="1979">A view in which the output (as in HTML) of the debugger is shown. usually appears in the bottom dock.</seg>
<seg id="1980">Depending on the supported functions of the debugger, all or part of the following functionality is available.</seg>
<seg id="1981">With this action, the connection to the debugger if necessary, or it tells the plugin to listen to debug requirements. this action is triggered by default if a project is opened that uses a debugger, so that normally it doesn't have to be respected.</seg>
<seg id="1982">The counterpart to Debugging session Start the session. closes the connection to the debugger or terminates listening to requirements.</seg>
<seg id="1983">Sends an HTTP request to the server to initiate a debugging request. this is equivalent to the use of a browser to view the current document. the output of this request is displayed in the View Debugger output.</seg>
<seg id="1984">Instructs the debugger to start executing the script and continuously send information about the monitored variables as well as the currently executed line. if this happens while the script is stopped, execution continues.</seg>
<seg id="1985">Instructs the debugger to start executing the script without having to send information to monitored variables and the current line number. if this happens while a script is stopped, execution continues.</seg>
<seg id="1986">The debugger will execute the next instruction in the script without entering the functions or include.</seg>
<seg id="1987">The debugger will execute the next instruction in the script, where possible error-adjusted in functions and include.</seg>
<seg id="1988">Instruct the debugger to pass the instruction and go to the next one as if there were not the current one.</seg>
<seg id="1989">Opens a dialog where a variable or an expression can be entered, which should be monitored. the monitored value appears in the variable view.</seg>
<seg id="1990">With this dialog you can enter a variable or set a new value of a variable.</seg>

<seg id="1992">This chapter describes how to adjust & quantaplus; adapt to your needs and how to help & quantaplus; help to get better.</seg>
<seg id="1993">Document type Editing packages (DTEP; s) are used in & quantaplus; to give support for markup and scripting languages as well as CSS; they enable & quantaplus; their simplicity and flexibility makes out & quantaplus; a fast, user-friendly & IDE; for web developers, simple to use and productive.</seg>
<seg id="1994">& DTEP; s are available in two types, family 1, the markup languages and family 2, the script languages and / CSS; s. & DTEP; s consist of two parts, the tag folder and toolbars. tag folder contains handy, symbol-orientated ladders of image buttons (above the editing window), which insert text and instructions more quickly into a document than a user could ever have.</seg>
<seg id="1995">& DTEP; s can be created manually (see below), downloaded or automatically created from an existing DTD. see for details on converting.</seg>
<seg id="1996">This document describes how to create tag XML files, then descriptionrc; and also toolbars. in short, a & DTEP;.</seg>
<seg id="1997">TagXML files (.tag) define both the specific attributes for tags as well as the layout and contents of the properties dialog, the & quantaplus; for the tag. file descriptionrc; file contains the rules and information of the & DTEP; even. toolbars allow a quick insertion of tags into a document without a risk of writing error.</seg>
<seg id="1998">Tag folders are nothing but a folder. they contain only the file descriptionrc; and the TagXML files. tag files carry the name of the description language and version, so available. (for example, html-4.01-strict)</seg>
<seg id="1999">The table below lists the elements of TagXML and declares whether they are necessary, or not. although not all are necessary, it is advisable to use as many as possible so that other users have a better insight and more information at work with them.</seg>
<seg id="2000">The following chapter describes each element in detail. everything about the possibilities and limits is explained in a simple way.</seg>
<seg id="2001">This is the root element of a tag XML document. it can only occur once in a document. it can contain the definition of many tags, but contains nothing but element type about itself otherwise.</seg>
<seg id="2002">The type of tags is a script function. when using & lt; attr &gt; is an argument of the function. (only family 2)</seg>
<seg id="2003">Valid only for the class class. the name of the base class for this class. (only family 2)</seg>
<seg id="2004">Only valid for the method method. specifies the name of the class where this method belongs. (only family 2)</seg>
<seg id="2005">When yes, the tag has a common attribute group and the attributes within this tag can be added to any other tag. (only family 1)</seg>
<seg id="2006">Sets a text in the dialog. this text is defined by & lt; text &gt; tag. this is a single element type element.</seg>
<seg id="2007">Describes an attribute of a tag. this element can only occur once for each attribute. it defines the name and type of the attribute. in addition, there are other tags that describe how to display this attribute, etc; This is a single element type element.</seg>
<seg id="2008">Specifies the source code used to fill the attributes in the tag editing dialog and in the attribute tree.</seg>
<seg id="2009">Requires source = dcop. the dcop interface within & quantaplus; used to reach source data.</seg>
<seg id="2010">Requires source = dcop and the name of an interface. the dcop method name within & quantaplus; used to achieve the data source.</seg>
<seg id="2011">Requires source = dcop, a interface and a method name. the arguments passed to the method. can be empty or% tagname%, which means the name of the current day.</seg>
<seg id="2012">A container tag that grouped the elements of a list. it can only occur once for an attribute description. it is an element type element only.</seg>
<seg id="2013">Defines the position of the attribute text of a tag within a dialog. this tag can only occur once for each attribute in a dialog only once (e.g. once for each attribute; attr &gt; tag). the element is empty.</seg>
<seg id="2014">Specifies the position and size of a field in the dialog. this tag should be present for each field in the dialog once (e.g. one for each field; attr &gt; and lt; label &gt; Tag). this element is empty.</seg>
<seg id="2015">Specifies a list of elements that may occur within the tags to be defined. this element is a single element type.</seg>
<seg id="2016">Returns a list of elements that end a day. this element is a single element type.</seg>
<seg id="2017">All TagXML files must start with a & XML; -declaration; & lt;? XML version = 1.0 encoding = UTF-8? &gt; and must be neatly chained and closed.</seg>
<seg id="2018">Spaces don't affect anything but pay attention to & lt; characters. these should be replaced by & amp;, especially in elements such as & lt; tooltip &gt;, & lt; text &gt; replaced.</seg>
<seg id="2019">To check the TagXML files, the Tools dialog is in the top of the & quantaplus; window to start and check TagXML. another dialog will appear, whose simple instructions are to follow.</seg>
<seg id="2020">This function is currently not available. currently, the check is only performed when loading the Tagged files in & quantaplus.</seg>
<seg id="2021">In the following example for a family 1 Tagged XML file. this file describes & lt; schema &gt; element from the & W3C; & XML; schema. the file name for this TagXML file should be schema.tag.</seg>
<seg id="2022">In the following example for a working family 2 Tagged XML file. in this file, a & PHP; overload function is described. the file name of this TagXML file should be overload.tag.</seg>
<seg id="2023">& lt;? XML version = "1.0" encoding = "UTF-8"? &gt; & lt;! doctype tags &gt; & lt; tags &gt; & lt; tag name = "overload" type = "class _ name" type = "option" / &gt; & lt; / tag &gt; & lt; / tags &gt;</seg>
<seg id="2024">The file descriptionrc; file is just as simple and there is an editor for attainable via DTD editing DTD settings. thus, diedescriptionrc; for a newly created & DTEP; for a newly created & DTEP; should be created a simple & descriptionrc; with the following entries:</seg>
<seg id="2025">[general] version = User 1 for & quantaplus; version & lt; = 3.1.2 and 2 for each higher version. name = DTD statement. (- / / W3C; / / DTD HTML 4.01 Transitional / / EN) Nickname = The simplified name of the DTD. (HTML 4.01 Transitional). if not specified, the name is used as nickname.</seg>
<seg id="2026">An action can be set with Settings actions... to be created. click on New Action to perform the same dialog:</seg>
<seg id="2027">The keyboard shortcut assigned to this action. by clicking on the Custom button, a shortcut can be assigned; with K1, the current keyboard shortcut can be removed.</seg>
<seg id="2028">The simplest actions. a text can be entered in the detailed settings and when executing the action, this text is inserted in the document at the current cursor position. see the example below.</seg>
<seg id="2029">This is the most powerful type of action. with the help of this action, external applications (usually scripts, but it is not limited) that change the document or use as input (or parts of the document) can be started. examples from & quantaplus; themselves are the Quick Start dialog or the various see in... actions for the (X) HTML DTEPs.</seg>
<seg id="2030">First, the name of the script and the interpreter must be specified. example: SH / home / myHome / myScript.sh.</seg>
<seg id="2031">Although qualified paths are allowed, it is recommended to use the% scriptdir variable in the command line, such as sh% scriptdir / myScript.sh. This way tries & quantaplus; the script in the following places: $KDEHOME / share / apps / Quanta / scripts in their path: $PATH There is another special variable that can be used in the command line:</seg>
<seg id="2032">% f: we will be replaced with the URL of the current document. in case of a local document file: / from the document name will be removed.</seg>
<seg id="2033">% pid: will be replaced with the PID of the current & quantaplus; only one instance runs, the text unique is attached to the PID number. this is useful when DCOP is used to control & quantaplus; it is used by the external script.</seg>
<seg id="2034">The parameter for this event, usually the file name of the current document or path to the project file.</seg>
<seg id="2035">In addition to the methods listed above, a script can input from & quantaplus; to the default input. in the input field input can be determined what to send to the default input. options are:</seg>
<seg id="2036">Selected text: the selected area of the document is sent to the script. the% input variable is normally only meaningful with this setting.</seg>
<seg id="2037">According to the input, the output of the executed application can also be redirected. there are two types of output: normal output, written to the standard output; error messages, to the standard error output. it can be specified, which is to be done with the text written to the standard output by setting the value in the output field output:</seg>
<seg id="2038">If there are many tags in the markup language, it is recommended to subdivide the tags into logical groups. in the given case, it is not too many, so you can create a toolbar with the name of the popup.</seg>
<seg id="2039">Once a toolbar has been added, you need to add and configure actions. select Settings.</seg>
<seg id="2040">The parts of this window are quite self-explanatory. press the New Action button at the bottom of the window starts editing mode.</seg>
<seg id="2041">Fill out all necessary fields and add the tag to the appropriate toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2042">Complete everything and, if the Tag Attribute has attributes and you are planning to use it, enable "Edit Tag" dialog when available to allow input when using the action.</seg>
<seg id="2043">Igitt! is this an ugly symbol. who should remember the action in connection with this symbol? let's replace it before we have difficulties.</seg>
<seg id="2044">To create a symbol that represents the action better, we will use & kiconedit; choose from & KMenu;, Graphic Other programs (or where else it is located in your distribution).</seg>
<seg id="2045">& kiconedit; uses 32x32 pixels by default, but we need 22x22. to change this, select Edit size.</seg>
<seg id="2046">Please note that the created symbol not only helps you to remember what the action does, but also to all other users of the & DTEP;.</seg>
<seg id="2047">With regard to the fact that the day starts, I decided to create a start button as a symbol. by using green (green usually appears to be los, stared, further interpreted), or should at least be signaled a message to the user that clicking this symbol is a & lt; start; tag in the current document.</seg>
<seg id="2048">After creating the symbol, it still has to be connected with the action. this is done through the menu with Settings actions... (in & quantaplus;) and selecting the desired action. next to the text box is a button, press it.</seg>
<seg id="2049">Select the folder where the saved symbol is located, select it and confirm with OK.</seg>
<seg id="2050">Press the Apply button and continue with other tags, so there are others, or confirm with OK to complete.</seg>
<seg id="2051">Suppose you want to add some common & quantaplus; functions to the toolbar, or it should be divided into several groups for a better overview by some separators.</seg>
<seg id="2052">After selecting the element that is to be added to the toolbar, press the arrow key to the right. this adds the item to the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2053">For example, I would like to have a quick way to access the Konqueror preview. I will select it and add it to the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2054">Please note how the separator support the grouping. someone who does not know my tool bar could believe that the & konqueror; button is the opposite of the start button.</seg>
<seg id="2055">The new toolbar has to be tested by masturbating all the symbols to ensure that everything works.</seg>
<seg id="2056">Save to the right folder. after new XML does not exist, it will be created in the root folder, but your toolbar (s) should be stored in the correct folder. please adjust your file descriptionrc so that your toolbar (s) is loaded (s) when a file is opened from the corresponding type.</seg>
<seg id="2057">Perhaps the most notable extension of & quantaplus; for the normal user it is possible to add documentation for the scripting language or the formatting language you like most. that's why this chapter describes how I create a PHP; documentation tree for my personal use.</seg>
<seg id="2058">Before starting your own documentation, you might check in & quantaplus; -Repository if someone has already done it for you.</seg>
<seg id="2059">There are two parts in this process. first you need to look for an existing documentation for the formatting / script / etc; language. then you need to create the docrc file. we'll leave the first part to you, we treat the second one here.</seg>
<seg id="2060"># KDE Configuration File [Tree] Doc dir = path, relative to this file, to the documentation HTML files e.g. php42 / # elements in the main index Top element = your description for these documentaries e.g. & PHP; 4.2 Documentation Section 1 = Section1.html Sec2.1 = Section1.html Sec2.1 = Section1.html Sec2.1 = Section1.html tag1 = funcname tag2 = funcname tag2 = tag1.html tag2 = functions.html tag3 = tag1.html tag3 = functions.html</seg>
<seg id="2061">The Tree section defines the visible part of the documentation in the documentation tree. for example, see the section in PHP; documentation such as:</seg>
<seg id="2062"># KDE Config File [Tree] Doc] Doc dir = php42 / # top level element top element = PHP 4.2 documentation PHP 4.2 documentation = Table of Contents = index.html Getting Started = Introduction,...</seg>
<seg id="2063">Note the # vor Getting Started and Language Reference. this indicates that it is subfolders in the tree with its own content. there is no known limit for the depth of the shaft (except by reason), but try it yourself.</seg>
<seg id="2064">Note that the table of contents is referenced directly to a file (and consequently at the top end of the tree view & mdash; the folder is displayed!).</seg>
<seg id="2065">Spaces affect nothing but pay attention to & lt; characters. these should be replaced by & amp; in all & XML; -based & quantaplus; resources files will be replaced.</seg>
<seg id="2066">The content section is the area of the docrc file, which is used to create context sensitive help. for example, when writing a & PHP; script the documentation for the mysql _ fetch _ array function should be displayed. there are only two types of entries: the context list (context list) and file connection lines.</seg>
<seg id="2067">A simple list of contextual elements that should be available (for & PHP;, these are the functions of & PHP;).</seg>
<seg id="2068">Now you can easily save your docrc file to $HOME / .kde / share / apps / Quanta / doc or $KDEDIR / share / apps / Quanta / doc for local or global use. then create a folder (just as you specified this in your docrc file) in the same folder as docrc and copy your HTML documentation to it.</seg>
<seg id="2069">If you are sure that these are good and worth sharing, send your docrc files with a description of important information, e.g. which documentation was used to the & quantaplus; -community. you will not be rich, but proud to have worked with the best web development platform.</seg>
<seg id="2070">With & quantaplus; you are not alone. it is possible to share the waste resources (DTEP packets, toolbars with actions, scripts, templates) with others. there are two ways to do this:</seg>
<seg id="2071">The resources can be sent by e-mail to friends, partners or otherwise. in different places, you can send an Email to a menu item, such as DTD DTD (DTD) package (DTEP), in the context menu of files and folders in the templates and in the script tree.</seg>
<seg id="2072">The resources can be uploaded into our main archive, from where all the other & quantaplus; users can download them. to make a contribution we recommend signing the resources for which it needs a GPG / PGP key. thus, the origin of resources is guaranteed, both for our team and for later users.</seg>
<seg id="2073">When uploading, you are asked for their passphrase for their private GPG keys (the passphrase is not saved), or in the event that you have multiple keys, you can choose one. in the New resource dialogue, the input fields must be filled out (URL preview can remain empty) and by clicking on the OK button you can start uploading.</seg>
<seg id="2074">Uploading can be uploading from menus DTD DTD package (DTEP), uploading toolbars, and started in the context menu of files and folders in the templates and scripts tree.</seg>
<seg id="2075">After downloading a resource, before installation, checked & quantaplus; the integrity of the resource by checking integrity and signing. in case of problems it warns and it can then be aborted. if the integrity is given and the resource is signed correctly, a message appears with the indication of the source of the resource.</seg>
<seg id="2076">It is possible to work in XML languages currently not supported by & quantaplus; however, creating a DTEP package can be time-consuming, because hundreds of tag files in tag XML format might be necessary. there is a simpler way to convert a DTD into a DTEP package automatically.</seg>
<seg id="2077">The conversion can be started from the DTD menu and Convert a DTD. select the .dtd file with the DTD description to be used. then the following dialog appears:</seg>
<seg id="2078">Target directory name: the newly created & DTEP; is written with this name in the $KDEHOME / share / apps / Quanta / dtep folder.</seg>
<seg id="2079">! Doctype Defintion line: the string that will appear in the! doctype tag, such as HTML PUBLIC - / / W3C / / DTD HTML 4.01 Transitional / / EN http: / / www.w3.org / TR / HTML4 / loose.dtd</seg>
<seg id="2080">Fine adjustment of the DTEP after conversion: if enabled, adds & quantaplus; after converting the file descriptionrc; editor, with the details of the newly created & DTEP; it is recommended to use this option.</seg>
<seg id="2081">In & quantaplus; there are some key concepts. in order to understand them and to take full advantage of & quantaplus, one must first familiarize oneself with these fundamental concepts. this chapter tries to teach them precisely these concepts without understanding their understanding & quantaplus.</seg>
<seg id="2082">In & quantaplus; the work area is divided into three areas: global, local and project-related. this distinction concerns a number of components in & quantaplus;.</seg>
<seg id="2083">Global elements are available to anyone who uses & quantaplus; all that is marked globally is stored in the common folder structure of & quantaplus. this allows the group of administrators to secure different toolbars, actions and patterns in the global tree that will then be available to everyone in a multi-user environment on the system.</seg>
<seg id="2084">Local elements represent a personal collection of web development tools for a single user. these are user-specific patterns and toolbars. local elements are stored in the user directory so that only the user can use them personally.</seg>
<seg id="2085">Project-related elements are available only within a specific project. this can be everything from & CSS; patterns to toolbars with special actions specifically for the files of a particular project. simply put, this is the most restricted size. all elements are stored in the folder tree of the project, which emoys the common usage of special tools and patterns from all employees within the project.</seg>
<seg id="2086">The & quantaplus; -MDI; consists of some main areas: the editor window, the construction prospects, the tabs with information and the tool bars. please suggest in and for more information on these areas.</seg>
<seg id="2087">You can click on the tabs with the right mouse button to get a context menu with the current document appropriate entries, such as closing the current, other or all truneivers, reload, delete or upload the document, jump to a bookmark or execution of CVS commands to the current document.</seg>
<seg id="2088">Right-click in the Editor area will lead to another context menu on the processed document content, such as basic editing steps (cut / paste / paste), edit the tag under the mouse pointer, or open the file when the character string under the mouse-cursor describes a file.</seg>
<seg id="2089">At the top end of the editor window are the toolbar of the editor. currently & quantaplus; & HTML; 4.01 Transitional as standard, for which a set of toolbars is shown. in the course of further expansion of & quantaplus, the toolbars are adapted to the new functions and related user needs.</seg>
<seg id="2090">The use of tool bars is really easy. if you want to insert a simple tag, e.g. & lt; insert into your document, then click the icon that represents the tag. now you can enter the data for this just inserted day. if you want to insert a tag that has multiple attributes (such as anchors), you can fill in a dialog different fields.</seg>
<seg id="2091">The Building Insights (QIT) make it possible to navigate in the information to & quantaplus; to navigate, open it and strip them. in the presentation with card readers are available for files, project, model templates, document structure, scripts, attributes and documentation.</seg>
<seg id="2092">Project Management is a powerful tool that provides & quantaplus; this view shows all files in the project and allows to manage files in the project by right mouse click. actions such as adding, removing, uploading or deleting files from the storage medium can be performed using the context menu displayed.</seg>
<seg id="2093">Another possibility of & quantaplus; is the use of templates. almost everything can be a template: pictures, program parts, a whole website & etc; all possibilities are open to you.</seg>
<seg id="2094">Templates can be divided into three categories depending on which context they are used. global templates are always available, local templates are available only for the corresponding user and templates in projects can only be used in the project. more on templates can be found in the project.</seg>
<seg id="2095">Here you will find information about the available scripting languages. the concept of splitting into global, local and project works also here. by clicking with the left mouse button, you can access the available information to a script.</seg>
<seg id="2096">This view shows the internal structure of the active document. by clicking on an element, the cursor is placed in the document on the position of the element. by right-clicking on an element, a list of commands is opened with respect to navigation and refresh of the tree.</seg>
<seg id="2097">This tree appears among the other tree views. with it, it can quickly change attributes and namespaces. the application system aligned to the content allows the change of all available attributes with just a few mouse clicks.</seg>
<seg id="2098">Here is the complete documentation on the web technology for your development. you can download pre-packed documentation for & quantaplus; from the quantaplus; 'Documentation site, you can create your own documentation, and by adding a folder doc to a project can be appended, edited and viewed.</seg>
<seg id="2099">By default & quantaplus; two tabs at the bottom of the window that can be accessed using the useful information: the message window and the problem window.</seg>
<seg id="2100">This tab displays information about each script running in Quanta. for example, the currently used DTD of the current document and all changes to DTD are displayed.</seg>
<seg id="2101">This tab shows all errors in the markup of the current document. & quantaplus; -scripts that are executed give all error messages (as there are) in this window.</seg>
<seg id="2102">Die & quantaplus; tool bars are extensive and easy to understand. show them on a symbol and they receive the corresponding command. the chocolate page of the toolbar is the possibility to define your own commands as symbols in & quantaplus.</seg>
<seg id="2103">Another function of & quantaplus; is the ability to send a toolbar with EMail. & quantaplus; sends the toolbar as compressed Tar archive via & kmail;. if they receive a toolbar in an email, they can secure and load them in & quantaplus; like any other.</seg>
<seg id="2104">It is reasonable if you want to adjust the location of the & quantaplus; files on your system. for this autoconf has a number of options that can be passed to the configure script. to get a complete list of all options, type. / configure --help. the options are easy to understand and not executed here.</seg>
<seg id="2105">If you have problems starting & quantaplus; you should check if your path contains the & kde; 3 bin folder. also, you should make sure that no older version of & kde; 3 in the PATH is in front of its bin folder. the same goes for & Qt;.</seg>
<seg id="2106">& quantaplus; is a web development tool for the KDE desktop. & quantaplus; has been optimized for rapid web development and combines a mature development environment with a variety of powerful features.</seg>
<seg id="2107">While trying to create the best & HTML; editor, the developers of & quantaplus began to deal with an obvious idea: what would be if & quantaplus; an independent, expandable markup language editor would? well, this would make it the absolutely great web development tool for & kde; so it was done.</seg>
<seg id="2108">No longer limited to pure & HTML; limited, is & quantaplus; now well on the way to a general and comprehensive web development tool. summarized: if you can define it in & XML; then & quantaplus; for this the appropriate & IDE; be.</seg>
<seg id="2109">Well, to the above claim must be stated that & quantaplus; as a product based on the outstanding efforts of the entire & small; developer community is based. & quantaplus; follows, in good use of free software, the idea of why develop, what has someone else developed? thanks to the & kde; -scaffold not only this is possible, but it allows users and developers to expand, as they need it for their needs.</seg>
<seg id="2110">& quantaplus; allows web developers to dramatically increase the use of an intuitive and powerful multi-document surface (MDI;). by means of self-knitted actions, scripts and toolbars, automation is almost every task possible.</seg>
<seg id="2111">& Quanta; Plus; is a web development environment for HTML and related languages. it was designed for rapid web development and quickly expanded into a mature editor with many powerful features.</seg>
<seg id="2112">& Quanta; Plus is in no way associated with commercial versions of & Quanta; the original developers left the GPL licensed version and produced a commercial program.</seg>
<seg id="2113">More in the detailed documentation is provided with help: / Quanta (either this URL in & konqueror; type, or khelpcenter help: / Quanta).</seg>
<seg id="2114">& Quanta; is currently being developed and managed by Eric Laffoon Sequitur @ kde.org and Andras Mantia amantia @ kde.org.</seg>
<seg id="2115">A quick access list of files that you have opened. this list changes every time you open a file that is not on it, the oldest entry is taken out.</seg>
<seg id="2116">This allows you to save code parts and whole files as templates for later use. check the section about templates. if you are trying to save the selected file / text outside the local / project template folder, only one error will be reported.</seg>
<seg id="2117">Converts special characters to & HTML when inserting from the clipboard, so that they are displayed correctly and not misunderstood by the browser as formatting instruction.</seg>
<seg id="2118">Converts the text from the clipboard into & URL; -Description, which is the correct way to insert special characters and spaces in & URL; s. primarily used to insert & URL; s into the anchor tag.</seg>
<seg id="2119">Switches the block selection on or off. this allows you to select text blocks using the & Shift key.</seg>
<seg id="2120">Go directly to a line number. this is very helpful if your & PHP; -script releases error messages!</seg>
<seg id="2121">Search a string or regular expression in the selected directory. a type grep or sed with GUI and predefined expression to help you.</seg>
<seg id="2122">Displays the message window or not. that is the window in which you see the display of script actions and the debugger.</seg>
<seg id="2123">Routing and switching on the problem reporter at the bottom of the & quantaplus; main window. the problem reporter is activated as soon as you change to the structure tree.</seg>
<seg id="2124">Displays the column links on the left of the main window. this column allows you to set bookmarks with a mouse click.</seg>
<seg id="2125">If there are bookmarks in the current file, they will appear in the menu along with the entries Previous or Next, depending on the cursor position in the document.</seg>
<seg id="2126">Bookmarks from other opened documents appear in the menu according to the file name of the other documents.</seg>
<seg id="2127">Opens an existing project from the hard disk. & quantaplus; -Projects are saved with the file extension .webprj.</seg>
<seg id="2128">Presents a dialog to insert files into the current project. the selected files will then be copied to the project directory.</seg>
<seg id="2129">Searches the project directory for new files that could be there. this allows you to copy graphics files to your project folder or subfolder and then add them to the project.</seg>
<seg id="2130">Upload files in your project to the server. the list of available transportation methods depends on your version of & kde; and whether you have downloaded more input / output modules (KIO slaves).</seg>
<seg id="2131">Settings like & quantaplus; the project managed. in chapter & quantaplus, you will find the details.</seg>
<seg id="2132">Loads a project tool bar. these are stored in Project You / toolbars and are only in this menu if you have assigned them to this project.</seg>
<seg id="2133">A dialog to save your toolbar. allows you to select the type of toolbar: locally or project.</seg>
<seg id="2134">Opens a dialog to add a new toolbar. this only creates the name. actions must be saved by means of Settings... Add. toolbar buttons are saved by toolbar buttons or you will be asked if you want to save the toolbar buttons.</seg>
<seg id="2135">Removes a toolbar from the field of view. this does not delete it from the disk. if you haven't saved the toolbar, you will be asked if you want to do so.</seg>
<seg id="2136">This allows you to send your own toolbar to someone (perhaps to the & quantaplus; team so that the tool bar is present in the next publication). the menu item opens a new email message with the toolbar as attachment.</seg>
<seg id="2137">Allows uploading toolbars to the main server, where everyone else can access it. see in.</seg>
<seg id="2138">Load a & DTD; you or anyone else has made and convert to & quantaplus; own description format.</seg>
<seg id="2139">Load / refresh the entities from the & DTD; it makes sense if the entities from the & DTD are to be refreshed without updating the whole & DTEP; if this is global and a write permission in the global KDE folder is not present, the load fails.</seg>
<seg id="2140">This menu contains a list of tags that are present in the currently loaded toolbars. if the standard (HTML;) toolbar is loaded, there is a submenu standard in the tags menu, which contains the list of tags / actions on this toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2141">Allows access to the current day settings dialog when there is one. this entry is always present in the Tags menu, followed by & DTD; -specific sub-menus.</seg>
<seg id="2142">Currently, this only works with (X) HTML DTDs. intelligent inserting means that & quantaplus; inserting the paste by toolbars if this day contradicts the rules.</seg>
<seg id="2143">In the plugin menu, the available plugins are listed under the menu items above. click on them.</seg>
<seg id="2144">Selects syntax highlighting mode for the current file. the list of available highlighting schemata depends on the current version.</seg>
<seg id="2145">Select the type of line end identifier. very useful when you know people using other OS platforms to develop. choose Unix, Windows / DOS or Macintosh.</seg>
<seg id="2146">Checks the syntax of the current document using the selected & DTD; by means of the external application tidy.</seg>
<seg id="2147">Immediate changeover between different types of user interface. due to some limitations in the KDE libraries, switching may sometimes take time or cause unattractive graphics. recommended is the flashcard mode, which is also the default setting, or the subwindow mode that corresponds to the representation in & quantaplus; 3.2 and earlier.</seg>
<seg id="2148">In addition, this menu provides an entry for each open sub-window. selecting an entry will activate the corresponding subwindow.</seg>
<seg id="2149">Switches the status bar on the bottom of the & quantaplus; main window or from.</seg>
<seg id="2150">The changes in this dialog will affect any application using the KHTML part, including the & konqueror; web browser.</seg>
<seg id="2151">Specifies the behavior of the editor window. in the documentation of & kate, one finds details.</seg>
<seg id="2152">A dialog appears in which you delete entries from the toolbar or add them and change the sequences.</seg>
<seg id="2153">This should create a help corresponding to the environment of the mouse pointer, but is not implemented yet.</seg>
<seg id="2154">& quantaplus; is a high-quality product that is freely available and licensed, but as with any open source project, developers can always use help. if they want to support the & quantaplus; development in financial form, they find the way here.</seg>
<seg id="2155">The fields are self-explanatory and should preferably be filled from top to bottom, since, for example, after completing the project name, the whole directory structure is completed automatically for the rest of the project. all those paths and author information fields can be set later using Shift; F7 Project Project Properties.</seg>
<seg id="2156">Here is the name for the project to enter, for example foo. when entering Name, file will be filled in automatically.</seg>
<seg id="2157">This is the name of the Quantaplus; project file. by default, it has the name of the project in lowercase and without spaces with extension webprj (e.g. foo.webprj). this file is stored in the project directory.</seg>
<seg id="2158">Here you enter the server address of the machine you want to access, unless you edit local data. either a name (hostname.de.de) or an IP address (127.0.0.1) are possible.</seg>
<seg id="2159">If you leave this field empty, the default settings of the chosen protocol will be used. depending on the remote host setting, an adjustment could be necessary.</seg>
<seg id="2160">This is the folder where templates for the project are stored. it is a relative path to the project and templates. if a common collection of files is used for different projects, this folder should be set instead of the standard.</seg>
<seg id="2161">This is the folder where the toolbars are stored for the project. it is a relative path to the project and toolbars as standard. if a common collection of files is used for different projects, this folder should be set instead of the standard.</seg>
<seg id="2162">This allows to insert files from the local file system into the project. multiple files or entire folders can be selected.</seg>
<seg id="2163">This setting is great if you have static web content you want to download and edit. for server-side scripts (e.g. & PHP;, Python, etc;) you have to go differently.</seg>
<seg id="2164">Let it be checked if files that are located somewhere in the main folder of the project should be included. if a project is started anew from scratch, do not hook.</seg>
<seg id="2165">This option displays all files and folders within the main folder and you can make an exact selection according to good manure.</seg>
<seg id="2166">This shows a list of files in the main folder. you can select the files you want by hooks or by removing the checkbox from the project.</seg>
<seg id="2167">The last screen of the new project wizard contains three settings that simplify your work. these settings can be uploaded in the menu with project Project Properties in the subwindow profiles, or modified with Shift; F7.</seg>
<seg id="2168">Some settings correspond to those in the project wizard and are described in. the additional entries are explained below.</seg>
<seg id="2169">A list of file names (placeholders is possible), which are ignored in project-related operations such as project folders.</seg>
<seg id="2170">Additional option to above, also files listed in .cvsignore, are excluded from the project.</seg>
<seg id="2171">The project view, which is loaded when the project is opened, can be read more about project views.</seg>
<seg id="2172">This can be used to select the desired debugger. currently only Gubed is supported. more information about Gubed can be found in. the debugger plug-in can be set using the Options button.</seg>
<seg id="2173">Uploading profiles (see in) can be set in the Profiles subwindow, as well as the display of a tree view for the contents of the server for each profile by pointing out its own tree view for each profile.</seg>
<seg id="2174">In the team configuration subwindow, project members can be added, edited or deleted as well as a mailing list. see the details.</seg>
<seg id="2175">In the event configuration subwindow, you can turn on event actions and add, change or delete events. event actions are executed when a previously specific event occurs, such as securing a file. see the details.</seg>
<seg id="2176">By default, you open & quantaplus; the last project that was opened. you can't influence this behavior at present.</seg>
<seg id="2177">To open another project, select Open Project... from the Project or the Project Open Project from the toolbar. the dialog project will be displayed and allows the selection of a project. projects have .webprj as extension.</seg>
<seg id="2178">If & quantaplus; closed, the project file will be saved automatically. you will be asked if you want to save changes before leaving, if & quantaplus; changed files. the same happens when you load a new project.</seg>
<seg id="2179">The project tree view gives free access to the files in the project. there the files can be managed in the current project.</seg>
<seg id="2180">The folder behaves as well, but the entries are missing open and open with... in the context menu accessible with the right mouse button:</seg>
<seg id="2181">Various profiles can be selected here. the profile contains information about the location of the uploaded files. see.</seg>
<seg id="2182">Allows removing the current profile. if only one profile exists, the button is blinded to prevent removing.</seg>
<seg id="2183">The password is kept in the core memory and forgotten when it comes to programming. this option is useful when frequent uploading of files is necessary and the rather unsecure password is saved on the disk -option is not in question.</seg>
<seg id="2184">This will stop the transfer or simply leave the dialog when you change your mind before uploading.</seg>
<seg id="2185">In & quantaplus; many highload profiles can be created, so that the project (or parts of the project) can be uploaded to different servers. when editing or creating a profile, this dialog will be displayed:</seg>
<seg id="2186">This is the name of the server to which the files should be copied. either a fully qualified domain name or an IP address will work.</seg>
<seg id="2187">The transfer protocol for uploading. the list depends on the version of & kde; and the installed kio slaves. at least you should choose from & FTP;, file (local) and nfs.</seg>
<seg id="2188">The port for the transfer. normally this does not need to be changed except the network administrator does not run a service on the usual port.</seg>
<seg id="2189">Depending on your fear threshold, this is either a time-saving function or a danger. use it at your discretion. the password is stored on the disk, so it can't be read easily, but everyone with programming knowledge can easily see it in plain text.</seg>
<seg id="2190">A project view is just a set of files and tool bars. there can be many views in a project, i.e. by simply swapping the view various files and toolbar buttons can be loaded and replace the currently opened files and toolbars.</seg>
<seg id="2191">Views can be saved, opened or deleted in the Project or Project toolbar, accessible via Settings Toolbar Project Toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2192">This chapter describes the parts of & quantaplus, with which one has to do the most. this not only helps increase productivity but also allows the adjustment of & quantaplus; to the own way of working.</seg>
<seg id="2193">As already mentioned above, toolbar buttons in & quantaplus; best can be stowed by the toolbar. use and Add differ. adding toolbars is treated at the bottom of the Adding tool bar section.</seg>
<seg id="2194">The toolbar and the symbols on it can be adjusted either by context menu (right-click on the toolbar), in which other actions such as toolbar buttons can be removed, toolbar buttons or toolbars can be executed, which will be displayed in the dialog where it can be specified, which actions should be visible on this or other toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2195">By calling the context menu to an action (symbol) on a toolbar, the entries will be removed and action processed, which are self-explanatory.</seg>
<seg id="2196">The toolbar and the actions on them can set up toolbar buttons in the menu with Settings... and Setting Settings.</seg>
<seg id="2197">& quantaplus; templates are basically like a common file system with advanced organization and interfaces. you can copy, move or merge any existing directory into the template tree. templates have in & quantaplus; in about the limitations one imagines for the file system.</seg>
<seg id="2198">Some with & quantaplus; provided templates have conditions for their use. please read the conditions specified at the beginning of each template before use.</seg>
<seg id="2199">Binary templates are usually included in documents using shortcuts (e.g. pictures with img src = / src / url). some examples can be found in the template tree under global templates.</seg>
<seg id="2200">Documents can be of any text document type. on the basis of these templates, new documents can be created. usually, more specific documents are written in appropriate subfolders. a simple framework for the purpose and organizes work in a corresponding way to be efficient. some examples can be found in the template tree under global templates. see for more information on the template tree.</seg>
<seg id="2201">This kind of templates is useful if not a new document based on a template but the same text area should always be inserted in the documents. you can include everything from a comment about a final note to a complete menu system on Javascript or Perl basis. some examples can be found in the template tree under global templates. see for more information on the template tree.</seg>
<seg id="2202">As the name says, these templates serve as templates for whole websites. they are a collection of various documents organized in a folder structure, summarized in a compressed tar archive. currently there are no examples in & quantaplus;.</seg>
<seg id="2203">Create a document structure as you like (XML;, & HTML;, DocBook, etc;) and select Save As Template Save As a local template....</seg>
<seg id="2204">As soon as this is done, note that (even if it is saved as a project template) the template is not visible in the project tree. look in the template tree under project templates.</seg>
<seg id="2205">Select text in your document and click Save as template Save as local / project template. alternatively, the selection can easily be dragged and dragged onto the tree view templates.</seg>
<seg id="2206">The creation of binary templates is simple: just copy the file into a template folder. all file management functions can be used, such as dragging and dragging or pasting over the Konqueror file tree.</seg>
<seg id="2207">You can click on a folder to the right in the file tree or in the project files, select a name for the template, and secure it. by default, it is backed up in the project folder, but of course it can be saved as a local or global template.</seg>
<seg id="2208">Project templates allow a very goal-oriented approach. you can set headlines and footers or dynamically interact with & PHP; create, insert files or link them with them. in addition, you can keep an eye on some things when using templates in projects.</seg>
<seg id="2209">The template structure in the Template Templates is based on the files stored in $KDEDIR / share / apps / Quanta / templates and $HOME / .kde / share / apps / Quanta / templates. each of these folders complies with one of four types of containers as explained above.</seg>
<seg id="2210">To specify the behavior of a folder is to click on the folder with the right mouse button and select Properties in the context menu. the following dialog appears:</seg>
<seg id="2211">A selection box with the three previously described types; files, text or templates.</seg>
<seg id="2212">This is enabled by default and fits everything except the regular folders in the template list. if a root folder would be set in such a way, it would be explicitly enabled in this path unless it appears explicitly. in case of a normal folder, the blah would appear with something like text module. if nothing appears, you will probably be in a root folder.</seg>
<seg id="2213">Allows previous or copied text for templates in this folder. this could be general header lines and footers for all templates for a specific project and allows a whole presentation to be provided with the appropriate headers / footers by copying content templates into a folder with special headlines / footers.</seg>
<seg id="2214">In addition, you have context menu (pointing right mouse button) through a complete command collection for adding folders or copying and inserting templates from one place to another.</seg>
<seg id="2215">& quantaplus; offers two modes: VPL; editor and VPL; & Source text editor available through the View menu. the first mode replaces the source editor by the VPL; editor and the second divides the editor window into two parts: the source editor and the VPL; editor.</seg>
<seg id="2216">The VPL; editor works as follows: it loads a document like a normal & HTML; - or & XHTML; page and a cursor. then you can edit and switch back to the source code editor, in which the changes made in the VPL; editor are visible in the source code.</seg>
<seg id="2217">When working with the VPL; editor in a document that contains & PHP; a small green symbol indicates the default of & PHP; source code. it is not possible to edit it directly with the VPL; editor. to edit and PHP; it is still necessary to change the code editor. there are no plans to change this behavior.</seg>
<seg id="2218">The second mode works just like the first one, except that the changes are visible both in the source editor and in the VPL; editor synchronously. by pressing F9 this mode is activated, this mode is already active, the key pressure moves the active cursor from one window to the other, keeping the position in the document.</seg>
<seg id="2219">The synchronisation distance between the VPL; editor and the source code editor can be set using the Quanta settings.... After selecting VPL, you can choose between synchronization after one click or automatically. in principle, the recommendation is: a small span for fast computers and a large span for slow.</seg>
<seg id="2220">Suppose you want to change the title of the website, it is possible to select document properties. thus, editing of invisible tags at work with the VPL-editor is possible. the document properties dialog is also invoked as soon as a new document is created with the VPL; editor. this can change the following:</seg>
<seg id="2221">Meta tags allow the storage of information about the document itself, e.g. keywords for Internet search engines. meta elements can be added or removed by pressing the two buttons below. a click on the list allows to change the content, e.g. keywords on the column name and keyword keyword 2 on the content column.</seg>
<seg id="2222">CSS rules are the new way of designing pages in your browser. you can add or delete CSS rules with the buttons under the list. editing CSS rules is currently not supported.</seg>
<seg id="2223">It is possible to include an external CSS style template by pressing the file-open button and selecting the appropriate file.</seg>
<seg id="2224">It is possible to use the cursor as in a word processor, by moving the arrows. under rare circumstances the cursor acts as usual. the selection works as usual. text can be inserted by typing and deletes it by button or distance key.</seg>
<seg id="2225">Inserting tags is done in the same way as the toolbars, as in the source code editor. note that inserting tags previously existing identical tags is not removed e.g. when an anchor day, surrounded with text, must be removed any other surrounding anchor day.</seg>
<seg id="2226">Some toolbars like the tables assistant or the Listen-Wizard are disabled. you will later be in the & VPL; work, in this release the tables or lists must be used toolbar.</seg>

<seg id="2281">There are many graphical tools to compare. so why & kdiff3;? let me briefly explain why I wrote.</seg>
<seg id="2282">The merge was very complicated because one of the contributors made many changes and at the same time had corrected the indentation at many places. another programmer had a lot of text in the same file. the result was numerous conflicts during merging.</seg>
<seg id="2283">The program I used showed me only the changed lines, but I could not see what exactly changed within these lines. and there was no indication of the places where perhaps only the indentation had changed. merging these changes was a minor nightmare.</seg>
<seg id="2284">This was the beginning. the first version of & kdiff3; could represent differences within a line and changes to white characters. later, a lot of other useful functions were added.</seg>
<seg id="2285">For example, if you want to quickly compare text, simply copy it to the clipboard and paste it into one of the reference windows.</seg>
<seg id="2286">A function that did a lot of work was the comparing and merging of folders. this function turned & kdiff3; almost into a full-fledged file browser.</seg>
<seg id="2287">This is useful when two persons work independently of each other on a piece of code and make changes. the original file (the base) helps & kdiff3; automatically selecting the correct changes. in this editor you can even edit the result directly. in this editor you can even edit the result directly. the screenshot shows three source files when merging:</seg>
<seg id="2288">& kdiff3; also helps you to merge and merge whole folders. this screen shot shows & kdiff3; in the folder merge:</seg>
<seg id="2289">& kdiff3; displays the exact differences and deal with the possibilities of today's color monitors. if you frequently have to check code, you will like this function.</seg>
<seg id="2290">Differences in white characters and tabs are displayed visible. if lines differ only in a certain number of white characters, one can see that at a glance at the summary in the column on the left side. (no more trouble if somebody changes the indentation.)</seg>
<seg id="2291">If a file is equal, and the other differs in one line, then the color indicates which file is different. red color means that both files differ.</seg>
<seg id="2292">If all files have the same name but are located in different folders then you can ease typing by just writing the file name of the first file. example:</seg>
<seg id="2293">Folders 2 folders, folder, folder, folder, folder, folder, folder, folder, folder, folder, folder, folder, folder, folder, folder, folder, folder</seg>
<seg id="2294">The Open dialog enables manual typing of file names, the selection of the file browser (file...) or selecting a last opened file from the drop-down list. the opening dialog tells your selection and displays them next time. you do not need to specify a third file; if you leave the entry for C, the analysis of the differences with two files is performed.</seg>
<seg id="2295">By pressing the folder... you can also select a folder. if you select a folder, the comparisons and merging of folders will be initiated. if a file is selected for A, but for B and C a folder, then use & kdiff3; the file name from A in the two other folders.</seg>
<seg id="2296">If merging is enabled, the input field will be active and can be edited. however, it is not absolutely necessary to immediately specify an output file. you can also do this later when saving.</seg>
<seg id="2297">The setup button opens a dialog with Settings. here you can specify options before you start comparing / merging.</seg>
<seg id="2298">Sometimes you don't want to compare a whole file, but only parts of a text. & kdiff3; allows you to drag text parts from the clipboard into the active settlement window. the comparison starts immediately. in the opening dialog you do not have to select files, you can simply close the dialog with the Cancel button.</seg>
<seg id="2299">You can also drag and drop: simply drag a file from a file manager or selected text from an editor and let it fall over a comparison window.</seg>
<seg id="2300">What is the idea behind it? sometimes a file contains several similar functions. if you want to find out how similar these functions are, it would be a relatively big effort. you would have to create two corresponding files, load them in & kdiff3; then you can simply copy, paste and compare the relevant sections.</seg>
<seg id="2301">Note: currently, you cannot remove anything from & kdiff3; just dropping text into a comparison window is supported.</seg>
<seg id="2302">Warning: some editors interpret the dragging and placing of text into another program as cut and paste (instead of copying and pasting). in such a case, your original data could be lost.</seg>
<seg id="2303">In the upper part of each text window is the info line. the info line of the source window contains the characters A, B or C, the filename and the line number of the first visible line in the window. (note that window C is optional.) Every Info line has a different color.</seg>
<seg id="2304">The three source windows are assigned the letters A, B and C. a has the color blue, B the color green and C is magenta. (these default settings can be changed via the Settings menu.)</seg>
<seg id="2305">When a difference is recognized, one can see the color which differs from the file. if both files differ, the default color is red. (color for conflict in the settings). the color scheme is particularly useful when comparing three files.</seg>
<seg id="2306">To the left of the text is the summary column. if differences were found, the column displays the corresponding color. in some programming languages, where white characters are not so important, it is useful to see only the relevant changes. (for C / C + +, for example, white characters are only relevant in strings and comments, for the preprocessor and in a few rare cases.)</seg>
<seg id="2307">The vertical line separating the summary column from the text is interrupted at the places where the respective source file has no lines. if the line breaks are enabled, the line is shown with dotted lines.</seg>
<seg id="2308">The result window (among the comparison windows) also has an info line with the title output:, the filename and [Change] if you have edited the result. usually it contains text by automatic merging, but often it also contains conflicts.</seg>
<seg id="2309">!!! until all conflicts are resolved, saving is deactivated!!! (use the buttons to find the next resolved / unsolved conflict to find the remaining conflicts.)</seg>
<seg id="2310">If only two comparison windows are used, each difference at the same time is also a conflict that has to be solved manually.</seg>
<seg id="2311">By clicking with the left mouse button in the summary column in one of the windows, the group belonging to the row is highlighted in all windows and the first line of the group is displayed. this group will then be highlighted with the color background color for current area and each on the left appears a black bar.</seg>
<seg id="2312">Sometimes there is no more line left in the group due to automatic merging or manual editing; this is only a placeholder in the event that you change your mind and perhaps still choose another source. this text does not appear in the final saved file, nor in a marking that you may copy and paste elsewhere.</seg>
<seg id="2313">The text & lt; merge conflict; however, appears in the clipboard if you copy such text from the result window. carefully go with this function.</seg>
<seg id="2314">Note: when selecting the sources, ignore the options Numbers or Ignore C / C + + comments enabled, changes in numbers or comments are also treated as white characters.</seg>
<seg id="2315">Navigate mainly with the scroll bars and mouse, but you can also use the keyboard. if you click in one of the windows, you can use the arrow keys left, right, high, down, page on, page starting, end, Ctrl-Start and Ctrl-End, Siv as you can also use it from other programs.</seg>
<seg id="2316">In the Auction window, you can also use the other buttons to edit. with the insert button you can switch between insert and overwrite mode. (default is insert mode.)</seg>
<seg id="2317">A click with the left mouse button in one of the summary columns synchronizes the view of all windows at the beginning of each group (as explained in the merge section and the editable output window).</seg>
<seg id="2318">The toolbar contains seven buttons for navigating you to the current / first / last difference, the next / previous difference (Ctrl-down / Ctrl-Up), to the next / previous conflict (Ctrl-Up / Ctrl-Up) or to the next / previous unsolved conflict.</seg>
<seg id="2319">To copy the selection to the clipboard, you need to press the Copy button (Ctrl-C or Ctrl-Insert). if this is enabled, whatever you mark, is automatically copied to the clipboard and eliminating manual copying. however, be careful because you could accidentally overwrite the contents of the clipboard.</seg>
<seg id="2320">Line ends are stored according to the underlying operating system. Unix flavors use a line feed character\, and Win32-based systems use carriage return + newline\\ r\. KDiff3 does not keep the line ends of the source files, therefore you should use & kdiff3; also not with binary files.</seg>
<seg id="2321">The options and the list of recently used files will be saved automatically when you exit, and restored at the next start. (Menu Settings &gt; KDiff3 to set up...)</seg>
<seg id="2322">Select a font with fixed width. (on some systems the dialog also provides fonts with variable width to choose from, but you should not use them.)</seg>
<seg id="2323">If you enable this option, differences in italic script will be displayed. if the selected script does not support this display, nothing happens.</seg>
<seg id="2324">On systems with only 16 or 256 colors, some colors could not be available in their pure form, but would be rendered astray. on these systems the button presets automatically set an odd color.</seg>
<seg id="2325">When this option is enabled, the corresponding number of spaces is inserted when pressing the Tab key. otherwise, a tabulator character is inserted.</seg>
<seg id="2326">If you press Enter or Return, the indentation of the previous line will be used automatically for the next line.</seg>
<seg id="2327">When this option is enabled, each selection is automatically copied to the clipboard. the manual copy to the clipboard then omitted.</seg>
<seg id="2328">You can select which line-end type you prefer to save. the default value is the generally common selection on the operating system used.</seg>
<seg id="2329">When comparing files, & kdiff3 attempts to find all fully identical lines in the source files. only during this first step, white characters can be ignored. the second step compares each line. in this step, white characters are not ignored.</seg>
<seg id="2330">Some editors (on some systems) save a carriage return character '\\ r' and a line feed '\' at the end of a line, others save only one line feed '\'. usually, the carriage returns are made visible, but the same as a white character. during merging this option has to be disabled. in default this option is disabled.</seg>
<seg id="2331">In the first part of the analysis numbers and associated characters ('0' - '9', '.', '-') are ignored. in the result, the differences are displayed, but they are treated as white characters.</seg>
<seg id="2332">By default, this option is disabled. changes in comments are treated like changes in white characters.</seg>
<seg id="2333">Search intensively for even smaller differences. the option is enabled in default. it is effective in complicated and large files, but slow with very large files.</seg>
<seg id="2334">In automatic jump mode, this setting determines how long the result of the selection is displayed before the next unsolved conflict is going on.</seg>
<seg id="2335">This is useful when white characters are used as a source. (default is manual selection.) This is useful when white characters are less important in many files. if you only need this from time to time, then use the Choose A / B / C for all unresolved white conflicts from the merge menu. note that the Auto selection also affects conflict in numbers or comments if the options ignore numbers or Ignore C / C + + comments enabled.</seg>
<seg id="2336">These options are discussed in the chapter on the scanning of folders and executing a merge. look for details under documentation for directory comparison and merging.</seg>
<seg id="2337">If a file is stored and already exists an older version, the original version will be appended to the suffix .orig. if such a backup file exists with the suffix .orig, it will be deleted without further backup.</seg>
<seg id="2338">Change the language of the user interface. changing this option does not affect the currently running program. you need to start & kdiff3; quit and restart, so that the change is active. (this option is available in the KDE version of & kdiff3; not available because the language is set there globally via the control centre.)</seg>
<seg id="2339">The following encoding settings can be set separately for each entry. if you enable this option, the upper setting is used for all entries.</seg>
<seg id="2340">The selection fields for coding shows a short notice of what the local coding is. (this cannot be changed here and has a purely informal character for you.)</seg>
<seg id="2341">Adjust the file encoding for source files. this affects how special characters are treated and interpreted. since the encoding for each file is individually adjustable, even files with different encoding can be compared and merged.</seg>
<seg id="2342">If you have edited a file, you can specify which encoding is to be used for saving.</seg>
<seg id="2343">If you define pre-processing commands, they might not work with your codec. (for example, your files could be 16-bit Unicode, but the pre-processing command can only handle 8-bit ASCII.) With this option you can specify the encoding of the output of pre-processing commands.</seg>
<seg id="2344">Turn this off to suppress highlighting of changes in white characters in text or review columns. (note: this also applies to changes in numbers or comments if the options ignore numbers or Ignore C / C + + comments enabled.)</seg>
<seg id="2345">This selection is only available if you compare three files. in normal mode, all differences are displayed in a color coded overview column. but sometimes you may only want to see the differences between two of three files. after selection of A & lt; gt; C or B & lt; gt; C will be displayed next to the normal yet another Supersichts column with the information you need.</seg>
<seg id="2346">Sometimes you prefer to use the available space on the screen for long lines. simply select the less important windows. (this option is in the window menu.)</seg>
<seg id="2347">This can also be useful for displaying long lines. (this option is in the window menu.)</seg>
<seg id="2348">Sometimes you see the differences and then decide to merge the files. the current file merges in the merge menu also works if you compare only two files. a simple click starts the merge and uses the file name of the last source file as default name for the output file. (if this function is used to restart merging, then the name of the last used output file will be retained.)</seg>
<seg id="2349">When reading a file, it is first committed to this external command. in & kdiff3, then the output of the command becomes visible, not the file itself. you can write your own preprocessor that corresponds exactly to your needs. you can use this function e.g. to cut out disturbing parts or to correct the indentation.</seg>
<seg id="2350">When reading a file, it is passed first to this external command. if a normal pre-processing command was specified (see above), the output of the command is used only when the line is used. you can write your own pre-processor, which corresponds exactly to your needs. each input line must have a corresponding output line.</seg>
<seg id="2351">The idea behind it is to give the user more flexibility in setting up the diff results. however, an external program is needed, and most users do not want to program this themselves. however, the good news is that in most cases sed or perl is completely sufficient.</seg>
<seg id="2352">Use this pre-processing command for line counting to convert the input into capital letters: SED's /\\ (. *\\) /\\ U\\ 1 / 'The\\ 1 in the replace string refers to the found text in the first log pair. the\\ U converts the found text into capital letters.</seg>
<seg id="2353">CVS and other version control systems use some keywords to automatically insert string generated strings (info: / cvs / keyword substitution). all follow the same pattern $\\ _ BAR _ log\\ _ BAR _ log\\ _ BAR _ log\\ _ BAR _ log\\ _ BAR _\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ $\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ $\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ $\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\</seg>
<seg id="2354">While you experiment with sed, you might start to understand it and perhaps you may even like these regular expressions. they are very useful because there are many programs that support very similar things.</seg>
<seg id="2355">Ignoring numbers is actually an already built-in function in KDiff3. but it is good as an example of a further pre-processing command for line reconciliation. sed's / [0123456789.-] / / g 'Every sign between' ['and'] 'is a hit, and every hit is replaced by nothing, so virtually deleted.</seg>
<seg id="2356">Sometimes you might want to perform several replacements at once. then you can use the semicolon ';' to separate the replacements from each other. example:</seg>
<seg id="2357">Instead of used you can also use something else like perl -p -e's / regexp / regexp / regexp / regexp / regexp / regexp / regexp / regexp / regexp / regexp / regexp / regexp / regexp / regexp / regexp / regexp / regexp / regexp / regexp / regexp / regexp / regexp / regexp / regexp / regexp / regexp / regexp / regexp / regexp / regexp / regexp / regexp / regexp / regexp / regexp / regexp / regexp / regexp / regexp / regexp / regexp / regexp / regex</seg>
<seg id="2358">The data after the normal preprocessor will be retained for viewing and merging. other operations only change the data that the line balance Algorythmus sees.</seg>
<seg id="2359">Note: in rare cases, if you use a normal preprocessor, the line-off preprocessor will see the output of the normal processor as input.</seg>
<seg id="2360">The preprocessor commands are very useful, but as with any function that changes text or hide differences, you may not notice certain differences and in the worst case destroy important data.</seg>
<seg id="2361">Often, programmers need to edit a lot of files in a folder. for this reason, you can compare and merge whole folders in recursively.</seg>
<seg id="2362">... makes a proposal for each object to merge; you can customize the proposal before the start,</seg>
<seg id="2363">... can simulate the merge and display the simulated changes without really performing them,</seg>
<seg id="2364">... execute selected actions either with all (F7 key), or only with selected objects (F6 key),</seg>
<seg id="2365">This is very similar to comparing and merging individual files. you only need to specify folders on the command line or in the dialog file.</seg>
<seg id="2366">If three folders are merged then folder 1 will be used as the base. if no destination folder was specified, uses & kdiff3; folder 3 as destination folder.</seg>
<seg id="2367">Note that only the comparison of folders automatically starts, not merging. to start merging, you need to select the corresponding menu entry or press the F7 key. (more details follow.)</seg>
<seg id="2368">While reading the folders, a small message window informs about current progress. if you cancel scanning the folders, only the files that have been compared to that date will be listed.</seg>
<seg id="2369">When scanning the folders is complete, shows & kdiff3; a list window with the results on the left,...</seg>
<seg id="2370">Each file and folder found during the scan is shown here in a tree. you can select an object with a simple mouse click.</seg>
<seg id="2371">The folder structure is usually folded up. you can open a folder by double-clicking on the + / -, or by using the arrow keys for left / right. the directory menu includes two functions All subdirectories to open and all subdirectories to open or unfold.</seg>
<seg id="2372">When double-clicking on a file, the file comparison is started and a comparison window appears.</seg>
<seg id="2373">The icon in the Name column reflects the type of file in the first folder (A). these types are possible:</seg>
<seg id="2374">If the file type is different in the other folders, then this is visible in the columns A / B / C and in the details pane to the selected object. in such a case, the clash action cannot be selected automatically. if the merge operation is started, you will be informed about problems of this type.</seg>
<seg id="2375">As shown in the picture above, the colors red, green, yellow and black are used in the columns A / B / C.</seg>
<seg id="2376">In identical entries, however, the color is identical, even if the age of the entries is different.</seg>
<seg id="2377">Folders are considered identical if their entire contents are identical. then folders also have the same color. in folders, the age is insignificant for its color.</seg>
<seg id="2378">The idea for this color scheme is based on dirdiff. the colors reflect the colors of a leaf that is green, then yellow and later when it is old, red becomes red.</seg>
<seg id="2379">... A and C are identical, but not B: copy B (or if B does not exist, delete the destination if it exists)</seg>
<seg id="2380">... A and B are identical but not C: copy C (or if C does not exist, delete the target if it exists)</seg>
<seg id="2381">... B and C are identical, but not A: copy A (or if A does not exist, delete the target if it exists)</seg>
<seg id="2382">... A, B and C do not have the same type of file (e.g. when A a folder and B is a file): error: conflicting file types. as long as such erroneous objects exist, merging cannot be started.</seg>
<seg id="2383">... A and B do not have the same type of file (e.g. when A a folder and B is a file): error: conflicting file types. as long as such erroneous objects exist, merging cannot be started.</seg>
<seg id="2384">The mode to synchronize is active if only two folders and no explicit target folder were specified and if the option synchronize directories is active. then select & kdiff3; the necessary action, so that both folders are identical afterwards. if for an entry...</seg>
<seg id="2385">... A and B exist, but not identical are: merge and save the result in both folders. (the user sees as visible filenames for the output file only B; directly after merging & kdiff3; B to A.)</seg>
<seg id="2386">If two folders are merged and the option New file is enabled instead of merging (insecure), then examine & kdiff3; the date of the files and suggests the newer file to copy. if the files are different, but the same date appears, error message appears.</seg>
<seg id="2387">During merging, one file is processed after another. it displays the status column if the merge has been successful, and accordingly other messages when something unexpected occurs. if merging is complete, you should make a final check and see if the status is all right.</seg>
<seg id="2388">If in the setup dialog the file comparison method is selected Full Analysis, KDiff3 will display more columns. these include the number of unsolved, deleted, non-white and white conflicts. (the resolved conflicts column is only displayed when three folders are compared or merged.)</seg>
<seg id="2389">You can either merge the currently selected entry (file or odds), or all entries at once. if you have selected all joined-up actions (also in all subfolders), you can start merging.</seg>
<seg id="2390">Please note: if you have not specified a destination folder, then in the three-folder merge mode, C will be used as a target. in the two-folder merge, B is chosen as the target and when synchronizing A and / or B is used as the target.</seg>
<seg id="2391">If you have selected a destination folder, please check whether all entries should be in the destination folder, even in the folder structure. there are a number of options that might be skipped by certain entries. check these options to avoid unpleasant surprises:</seg>
<seg id="2392">To merge all entries: select directory merge / continue in the directory menu or press F7 (the keyboard shortcut). to merge only the current entry, select action of the current element or press F6.</seg>
<seg id="2393">If there are still invalid merge actions by conflicting file types, a message appears that indicates the incorrect elements. you can then select a valid action for them.</seg>
<seg id="2394">When you merge all entries, a dialog box appears with the options Sections, Simulate and Cancel.</seg>
<seg id="2395">Select Simulate if you want to see what would happen without the really changes made. you will then receive a detailed list of all actions.</seg>
<seg id="2396">& kdiff3; then execute certain actions with all entries. if a manual intervention is necessary (merge a single file), a merge window opens (note the screenshot).</seg>
<seg id="2397">If you are finished with a file, select restart / continue directory merge or press F7. if you haven't saved yet, a corresponding dialog appears. then leads & kdiff3; its work continues with the next entry.</seg>
<seg id="2398">If & kdiff3; on a mistake, a message and detailed status information appears. at the end of the list you will see some error messages that will help you to avoid the cause of the problem. if you continue merging (F7 key), lets you try another action for the entry or solve the problem in a different way before you continue merging.</seg>
<seg id="2399">If some entries have been merged individually, you notice & kdiff3; these entries (in the current session) do not go together again. even if the merge operation has been skipped or not saved, these entries are considered settled. only if you change the merge action, these entries are merged again.</seg>
<seg id="2400">The Settings menu of & kdiff3; (Set menu Settings - &gt; KNO3...) now has a section called Directory-merge with these options:</seg>
<seg id="2401">Only files matching the specified pattern are displayed in the elemental-tree. it can be entered multiple patterns. separate the patterns with a semicolon; valid placeholder: '*' and '?'. (e.g. * .cpp; * .h). the default is *. folders must not match this pattern.</seg>
<seg id="2402">Files and folders that match this pattern are not displayed in the elemental-tree. it can be entered more than one pattern, use the semicolon; as separator. valid placeholder: '*' and '?'. default is * .orig; * .o.</seg>
<seg id="2403">Files and folders that match this pattern are not displayed in the elemental-tree. it can be entered more than one pattern, use the semicolon; as separator. valid placeholder: '*' and '?'. default is * .orig; * .o.</seg>
<seg id="2404">Ignores files that would be ignored by CVS too. many autoptically generated files are ignored by CVS. the big advantage is that this folder can be configured with a .cvsignore file. (see info: / cvs / cvsignore.)</seg>
<seg id="2405">In some file systems, files have a default attribute. in other file systems, a previous point. marks a file as hidden. this option lets you decide whether these files should be shown in the elemental-tree or not. this option is turned on in default.</seg>
<seg id="2406">Links to files: when the option is turned off, symbolic links are compared. if the option is turned on, the files will be compared, to which the links display. this is disabled in default.</seg>
<seg id="2407">For links to folders: if the option is turned off, the symbolic links are compared. if the option is turned on, the links like normal folders will be treated and recursively searched. (note that & kdiff3 does not check for possible recursions. a link to a folder containing a link to itself would result in an infinite loop and & kdiff3; crashes.) This option is switched off in default.</seg>
<seg id="2408">Performs a full analysis of each file and displays the statistics columns. (the number of deleted, unresolved, non-white and white conflicts.) The full analysis is slower than a simple binary analysis, and considerably slower if applied to files that do not contain any text. (enter a corresponding anti pattern.)</seg>
<seg id="2409">If you compare large folders over a slow network, it may be faster to compare the change date and file size. however, this speed advantage will cost you a certain amount of security. please use caution.</seg>
<seg id="2410">Similar to the change date. there is no real comparison. the files are regarded as identical, if they are equal size. this can, for example, be useful when copying the modified time. please use caution. this option is switched off in the preset.</seg>
<seg id="2411">Enable Synchronization mode when two folders are compared and no destination folder is specified. in this mode, the suggestions for merging files are selected in such a way that both folders are identical afterwards. also the results of merging files are stored in both folders. this option is switched off in the default.</seg>
<seg id="2412">If there are differences instead of merging, copying the newer file is suggested as action. (this is considered insecure, as the knowledge is assumed that the other file has not been modified too. you should check this in any case.) This option is disabled in default.</seg>
<seg id="2413">If a file or folder is replaced or deleted by another, the original version is renamed and receives the extension .orig. If an old backup file exists with the .orig extension, it will be deleted without further backup. this also applies to the normal merge of individual files, not just the merge of entire folders.</seg>
<seg id="2414">Normally, the folder merge view is visible while running single files; you can move the window divider with the mouse. if you do not want it, you can switch the window divider into the main window in the window menu and switch between the directory and text window between the two views.</seg>
<seg id="2415">You can also create a single file directly without having to start the folder merge. you can also use the Current File Conmerge from the merge menu. as soon as you save the result, the status will be set to zero and the file will not be merged once you start the folder merge.</seg>
<seg id="2416">However, this status will be lost if you re-read the directory: directory menu: read more</seg>
<seg id="2417">KDE supports network transparency with the help of KIO slaves. KDE uses this to read files and folders. in this way, you can specify files and folders for opening files located on local or remote machines.</seg>
<seg id="2418">The first command line compares a local file with one on an FTP server. the second command line compares a folder within a compressed archive with a local folder.</seg>
<seg id="2419">A URL has a different syntax as local files and folders. a few things you should consider:</seg>
<seg id="2420">A path may be relative and. or.. included. this is not possible with URLs, these are always absolute.</seg>
<seg id="2421">Special characters must be masked. (# - &gt;% 23, Space &gt;% 20, etc.). for example, a file named / # foo # has the URL file: /% 23foo% 23.</seg>
<seg id="2422">Sometimes due to the filesystem on the server, sometimes by the protocol used. it follows a short list of constraints:</seg>
<seg id="2423">Or it cannot be distinguished whether a link to a file or folder shows. then a file is always assumed as a link target. (FTP:, sftp:).</seg>
<seg id="2424">There is no way to edit permissions or modification date. therefore, the permissions or the modification date deviate from the original. (please note the default of the size.) (This is only possible with local files.)</seg>
<seg id="2425">The main purpose is currently in KDEVELOP. KDEVELOP always starts the built-in differences viewer. to start KDE3, press the right mouse button on the difference viewer and then select In KDiff3Part display from the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="2426">Usually requires & kdiff3; two full input files. if it is applied as a part, it takes & kdiff3; that the input file is a patch file in unified format. then remove & kdiff3; the name of the original files from the patch file. then start & kdiff3; the patch program to restore the missing file.</seg>
<seg id="2427">In the Konqueror you can click on a patch file and select from the Context Menu Preview in - KDiff3 Part. please note that this will not work if none of the original files exists. furthermore, this is unreliable if the original files have changed since the patch file has been created.</seg>
<seg id="2428">When & kdiff3; as part is executed, it only supports comparing two files, a very small toolbar and menu. merging or comparing folders is not supported in the KPart mode.</seg>
<seg id="2429">Tools with the name KDiff and KDiff2 already exist. furthermore, the name KDiff3 already indicates that it can merge as the program diff3 from the Diff Tool collection.</seg>
<seg id="2430">I have been using GPL programs for quite a long time and learned a lot by peeking into the sources of other programs. this is my thank you to all programmers who have walked this path or are going to go that way.</seg>
<seg id="2431">You compiled the program from the sources and probably didn't tell the configure script to KDE. in default, configure in / usr / local, but then KDE can't find the resources for the user interfaces (e.g. kdiff3ui.rc). in the README file you will find more information on this topic.</seg>
<seg id="2432">If only the number of white characters is different, these lines are treated as identical; however, if only one non-white character is different, the line is treated as not identical. iF similar lines of next to each other, this is the right dence, but this is often the case.</seg>
<seg id="2433">The editor notes for any difference in the files where it starts and where it ends. however, this is necessary to solve a conflict simply by clicking in the source code and selecting the button A / B / C. however, this important information is lost when the result is simply stored as text file and it is too much effort to create an own file format that could store this information.</seg>
<seg id="2434">The effort is so far too big. you can always restore a certain version by selecting a source A / B / C. to edit larger amounts of text, another editor should be used.</seg>
<seg id="2435">After removal of text, suddenly, no src is swept; and the text cannot be deleted. what does that mean and how can it be removed?</seg>
<seg id="2436">& kdiff3; uses many colors to emphasize differences. even more highlighting would be confusing and misses the purpose. please use another editor for this.</seg>
<seg id="2437">Many good ideas and bug reports came from colleagues and many people from the Wild Wild Web. thank you!</seg>
<seg id="2438">To be able to use all functions of & kdiff3; you need & kde; 3.1 or newer.</seg>
<seg id="2439">Information on how to use KDiff3 on other platforms without KDE can be found on the homepage.</seg>
<seg id="2440">A list of recent changes can be found in http: / / kdiff3.sourceforge.net / ChangeLog or in the ChangeLog file in the source package.</seg>
<seg id="2441">To compile and install; on a system with & kde; to compile and install, use the following command in the base folder of & kdiff3; -Distribution:</seg>
<seg id="2442">KDE-dir specifies the folder in your system where KDE is installed. if you are unsure, you will find more details in the README file.</seg>
<seg id="2443">Since & kdiff3, autoconf and automake are used, you should not have any problems with compiling. if you still encounter difficulties, please refer to the & kde; -mailing lists.</seg>
<seg id="2444">Cut out (Ctrl-X or Shift-Remove) copied to the clipboard and deletes the selected text. insert (Ctrl-V or Shift-paste) paste text from the clipboard to the current cursor position or replace the current marker.</seg>
<seg id="2445">Only show differences: files that are identical in all folders will not appear in the folder structure, and therefore not in the destination folder.</seg>
<seg id="2446">(in the current program version you need to re-read the folder with the Update function after changes to these options.)</seg>
<seg id="2447">This also means that identical files will not be copied to the destination folder during merging. if the destination folder does not already contain these files, they will be missing after merging. (the behavior will probably be changed in a later program version.) This option is switched off in default.</seg>
<seg id="2448">Note the buttons for selecting the source with the A, B and C labelling below the menu bar. if you click on one of the buttons, the rows from the corresponding window will be attached to the end of the selected group in the result window (if they are not already present).</seg>
<seg id="2449">In default this option is disabled. differences in individual characters (such as' A 'and' a ') are treated like differences in white characters.</seg>
<seg id="2450">The & Kpager; shows a mini preview of all virtual desktops. it is quite practical to see the running programs on the working surfaces, change their size, quit them or postpone them. this works both inside a desktop and in several.</seg>
<seg id="2451">The & Kpager; can display all virtual desktops as well as the applications running in it. applications can be selected and moved even on the desktop and to others.</seg>
<seg id="2452">With the middle mouse button, Windows can be moved within & Kpager; the movement is possible both within a desktop and on other working areas.</seg>
<seg id="2453">The context menu will depend on where the right mouse button is clicked: if on the empty background of & Kpager; clicked, the context menu has only the two entries Pager to set up... and exit. if however, the icon and name of the application and the entries Minimize, Maximize, On Desktop and Finish. the commands do the following:</seg>
<seg id="2454">Maximizes the application window to the full size of the desktop. only appears when clicked on an application.</seg>
<seg id="2455">Sends the application to the selected virtual desktop. only appears when clicked on an application.</seg>
<seg id="2456">If this check box is selected, Windows can be moved within the & cpager; s with the middle mouse button on the desktop and also to other worktops.</seg>
<seg id="2457">When this field is selected, the names of the virtual desktops are displayed in the & Kpager.</seg>
<seg id="2458">Tick this field lets the & Kpager; display the numbers of virtual desktops. if it is selected along with name, the names are provided with folder numbers, & eg; 1st desktop.</seg>
<seg id="2459">If this field is selected, the background of each desktop will be displayed as background in & pager.</seg>
<seg id="2460">When this field is checked, the running programs are displayed as small windows in & pager; otherwise only empty workspaces are displayed to enable their selection.</seg>
<seg id="2461">Here the view of the program window is selected. simply shows simple rectangles with the proportions of the program window. icon shows the window with its standard symbol and Pixmap displays a small view of the actual program window. remark: Pixmap is recommended only for very fast systems.</seg>
<seg id="2462">Here the arrangement of the & Kpager; main window can be determined: classically & Kpager; in a 2xN grid, as is known from Pager applications in some other window managers; horizontally, all virtual desktops are displayed horizontally and vertical in a vertical row, which is very well suited for viewing on the desktop.</seg>
<seg id="2463">The & Kpager; can be used as an alternative to the Pager mini program in the control bar. it has the advantage that it can be changed in size that can display and move windows as symbols or with their content. furthermore, it runs outside the control bar.</seg>
<seg id="2464">Right click within & Kpager; and then set up selector switch... allows the dialog box to appear.</seg>
<seg id="2465">Currently this cannot be changed in the Settings dialog. but you can do this manually:</seg>
<seg id="2466">Open the file $KDEHOME / share / config / kpagerrc with any text editor such as & kedit; or vi. if you do not have a write permission for the file, you must log in as user root or contact your system administrator.</seg>
<seg id="2467">Since & Kpager is part of the kdebase package, you need a functioning installation of the KDE base packages.</seg>

<seg id="2480">This application is interesting for different users: artists, web designers and people with visual impairment. this documentation should be a complete manual for the use of & cmag.</seg>
<seg id="2481">& Cmag; is a very powerful application that is constantly extended by new features. it is optimized for use on low-performance computers.</seg>
<seg id="2482">If you like & kmag, a window appears as shown above. the main window of & kmag; displays the enlarged area of the screen. in the following, this window is referred to as the magnification window. the image shown in the magnification window is an enlarged area of the screen and is referred to as a selection window.</seg>
<seg id="2483">In the default setting, you may enlarge the area around the mouse pointer like a moving magnifying glass. alternatively, you may or may be able to display a selected screen area in the magnification window or the surroundings of the mouse pointer at the edge of the screen (eg; at the left edge of the screen).</seg>
<seg id="2484">If you want to avoid that the mouse pointer is displayed in the enlarged window, select the position of the mouse pointer. please note that this may not be able to detect the shape of the mouse pointer. this is always the standard node; / Qt; -mouse pointer.</seg>
<seg id="2485">In the selection window mode, you can adjust the selection window to your own needs. you can move it with the arrow keys and mouse buttons and change its size. this can be done in the following way:</seg>
<seg id="2486">Move the mouse pointer in the magnification window and hold the left mouse button pressed, so you can capture and move the content of the magnification window. this also works with the arrow keys.</seg>
<seg id="2487">In addition, if you press the & Shift key, or use the & MMB; you can move the selection window.</seg>
<seg id="2488">With this combination you can change the size of the selection window. note that the upper left corner of the drop-down window remains fixed and only the lower right corner is to be moved.</seg>
<seg id="2489">You can send the enlarged picture directly to the printer, save into a file, copy it to the clipboard (to insert it into other applications later), turn the picture and much more.</seg>
<seg id="2490">Start or stop the update of the ad. stopping the update causes the required CPU time to go against 0.</seg>
<seg id="2491">Select the refresh rate (Very low, Gering, Medium, High, Very High). the higher the refresh rate, the more CPU time is needed.</seg>
<seg id="2492">In this mode, a select window will be displayed. the selected area is displayed in a window.</seg>
<seg id="2493">& kmag; automatically uses your set short commands to store files, open a new window, print, reload (with the button document recharge in & konqueror;), Enlarge and size & etc;.</seg>
<seg id="2494">It may also be known as a magnifier; it is a screen motion. you can use a magnifier to enlarge the area of the screen, as if you are using a magnifier to view the small print in a newspaper or a photo. this application is useful for different people: from research or artist to web designer or visual handicap.</seg>

<seg id="2498">& kmousetool; emulates a mouse click, as soon as the mouse pointer persists on the same spot. it is meant to help people suffering from repetitive punishment (RSI) syndrome, and each mouse-click pain. moreover, it can emulate pulling with the mouse. this requires a little practice.</seg>
<seg id="2499">& kmousetool; can handle pain caused by mouse clicks and helps many people to use the computer without pain. unfortunately, pain caused by the mouse will also cause pain. if you suffer from pain associated with your computer's use, you should consult a doctor if this has not happened yet.</seg>
<seg id="2500">To clarify this again: even if & kmousetool; avoid pain caused by clicking with the mouse, it is useless against pain caused by moving the mouse. and as with all ergonomic aids, the result can be different for everyone.</seg>
<seg id="2501">The use of & kmousetool; is simple: & kmousetool; monitors your mouse movements and takes a mouse click away as soon as you pause the movement briefly.</seg>
<seg id="2502">If the smart move is activated, make & kmousetool; a pause after pressing the mouse button emulated. move the mouse, wait until the end of the motion before releasing the mouse button. in this way, you can drag the dragging with pressed mouse button. the intelligent move requires a little practice, but you get used to it quickly.</seg>
<seg id="2503">This residence time must pass after the end of the mouse movement before & kmousetool; a mouse click executes.</seg>
<seg id="2504">If the Intelligentes move is enabled, the shooting field will be activated (1 / 10 s). here the time is set, the & kmousetool; after shutdown the mouse button waits before releasing the mouse button again, if no moving of the mouse occurs in the meantime.</seg>
<seg id="2505">& kmousetool; now supports the click by mouse shift. if this feature is enabled, a slow move to the right and back, followed by a pause, a click with the right mouse button. this moves are stored in the file $KDEHOME / share / kmousetool _ strokes.txt, if & kmousetool; the first time it is started, but can be changed later.</seg>
<seg id="2506">If the sound appears delayed, you can reduce the response time. to do this, go to Sound & Multimedia, select Sound & Multimedia, select Sound System and here the tab General. there is a slider tone buffer that you set to a lower value to shorten the response times.</seg>
<seg id="2507">If this setting is selected, it will start & kmousetool; at each start of & kde; this function is currently only available at & kde; for GNOME or other window environments, please consult the respective documentation to find out how to start a program there automatically.</seg>
<seg id="2508">Set all settings to the values set when the dialog is opened. if you have already depressed the Apply button, the settings will be reset to the last pressing of Apply.</seg>
<seg id="2509">Best use & kmousetool; first with the presets. in particular, the intelligent move should let you off first. if you are used to the automatic mouse click, you can later accept the intelligent move.</seg>
<seg id="2510">If you use the audible click it is necessary to reduce the response times of & kde; in case of sounds.</seg>
<seg id="2511">First, you should be aware of which places a mouse click remains without effect: clicking on the neutral parts of windows or in the browser window that does not display a link does not lead to unwanted reactions. you can therefore park the mouse at such places until you want to use them again.</seg>
<seg id="2512">If your mouse bucks, you should clean your mouse. this is usually quite simple. the trick is that you do not only clean the mouse ball, but also the roles that come into contact with the mouse ball.</seg>
<seg id="2513">First you have to take the mouse ball out. as that happens, mouse to mouse is different, but it should be clear when you look at the bottom of the mouse.</seg>
<seg id="2514">If you have removed the ball, you would have to see the rolls. these are located on the sides of the hole in which the ball was inserted. the dirt and the dirt can easily scrape off with a flat blade or the fingernails.</seg>
<seg id="2515">In very rare situations, the operating system interrupts the execution of & kmousetool; if you are using an intelligent move in this case, this means that & kmousetool; the operation can no longer be terminated by releasing the mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="2516">This happens when you & kmousetool; use under another window manager and move a window.</seg>
<seg id="2517">The solution for this problem is that you can run a mouse click yourself. this will reset the status of & kmousetool; and you can continue working as usual.</seg>
<seg id="2518">Problem: if you enter text, try & kmousetool; continue to execute mouse clicks and set the cursor to another location.</seg>
<seg id="2519">Solution: use the mouse to place the cursor here where you want it. but park your mouse on a neutral area of the desktop, if you want to make a keyboard input. this can cause accidental mouse clicks to cause unwanted reactions. safe zones for the mouse pointer are & eg; the gray areas around the toolbar and menus and the title lines of windows.</seg>
<seg id="2520">I try to work with intelligent postpone, but I don't manage to edit text.</seg>
<seg id="2521">The intelligent move is an advanced function of & kmousetool; and it takes its time before you can handle it. it is very likely possible in this way to mark text, copy it to the clipboard, or execute any other action in which you want to move the mouse with pressed mouse button. here are some advice:</seg>
<seg id="2522">Do not use the intelligent move if you just start using & kmousetool; instead, select text as follows: execute at one end of the text area a mouse click and hold the Shift key pressed while you move the mouse cursor to the other end of the text and press the mouse button again.</seg>
<seg id="2523">Use the audible mouse click. this is played every time, when & kmousetool; the mouse button expresses a sound like a mouse click. later, you know exactly when when the smart move is moving, you can also use the smart move without the mouse click. but you need some practice to do so.</seg>
<seg id="2524">To be able to use & kmousetool; use the XTest extension for & X Window; it should be the case on most systems already.</seg>
<seg id="2525">The functionality of the audible mouse clicks is only available if the system has a sound card and speakers and is correctly set up.</seg>
<seg id="2526">& kmousetool; activate the mouse button as soon as the mouse pointer persists. this program has been developed for people who suffer from RSI syndrome and cause pain of the mouse buttons.</seg>
<seg id="2527">& kmousetool; can also be configured to wait for a specific time to start a pulling process before releasing the mouse button. thus, drag and drop can be done with the mouse.</seg>

<seg id="2623">The output of screen readers has the highest priority. it is preferred to all other orders and keeps these orders. if the output of the screen reader is read, the sustained orders will be resumed.</seg>
<seg id="2624">Warnings have the next priority. this level is important news such as & eg; processor gets too hot. a warning has priority and keeps the output of messages and normal text.</seg>
<seg id="2625">Messages have the highest priority. a message interrupts normal text. & kmouth; is an example of an application that uses messages. while you & eg; read a long text on a website, you can start & kmouth; notifications are also messages. read about this.</seg>
<seg id="2626">The rest are simple text orders. any order that you infuse from the card list is a text order. KSayit is an example of an application that uses text orders. text orders are meant for the output of longer texts, which do not have any particular urgency.</seg>
<seg id="2627">All four types of orders are processed in queues, except for the output of screen readers. if an application sends the output of a screen reader during and ktats, this output is stopped and stopped.</seg>
<seg id="2628">First you need to know that filters are never applied to the output of screen readers. they are applied to normal warnings, messages and text orders as well as to & kde; -messages.</seg>
<seg id="2629">Filter the text and pass it on to the next filter. currently there are three types of filters.</seg>
<seg id="2630">Filters are designed as modules. in the future, there may be further types of filters.</seg>
<seg id="2631">String Translators replace parts of a text by other text. the parts to replace can be supplied either as words or as regular expressions. & ktts; is supplied with predefined string substitute filters, which allow the creation of chat emoticons such as: -) by text or for formatting messages from & congestion; or & kmail; in a better understandable form.</seg>
<seg id="2632">& XML; converters use an XSLT file (XML; Style Language - Transforms) to convert & XML; from one format to another format. included in & ktts; are some XSLT files for translation of & XHTML; included in SSML.</seg>
<seg id="2633">With subscriber selection filters you can send orders depending on the content of the text or depending on the program that sent the text to & ktts; sent to a speaker for example. if you have set a female voice for example on the card card speaker, you can read text from KDE messages about it.</seg>
<seg id="2634">Each of these filters has adjustable rules, after which it is applied to a speech output. if the filter states that its rules do not apply, it continues the text unchanged to the next filter.</seg>
<seg id="2635">When a text order, a message, warning or a & kde; notification to & ktts; is sent, it is processed by all activated filters that have been set up on the page below. processing by the filters is carried out in the order in the list from top to bottom.</seg>
<seg id="2636">This shows the list of normal filters set up. if a filter is not checked, it is not activated and is not used. filters are turned downwards from top to bottom.</seg>
<seg id="2637">Click here to insert a new filter. select the type of filter and it will display the below setup dialogs.</seg>
<seg id="2638">For setting string replacement filters, you need to enter a list of words or regular expressions as comparison patterns. if these patterns are found in the text, the text is exchanged for the corresponding replacement text.</seg>
<seg id="2639">Enter a name for your filter. you can select this name as you like, it only has to differ from the names of the other filters.</seg>
<seg id="2640">This is the list of words and regular expressions. the filter compares the text with the strings in the column agreement and replaces it in accordance with the string from the column Erase. the list is processed in the displayed order from top to bottom.</seg>
<seg id="2641">Click here to move the selected word or expression in the list.</seg>
<seg id="2642">With these buttons, you can load a list of words or regular expressions from a file, save or delete the current list. load a list from a file, the entries from the file will be attached to the existing list.</seg>
<seg id="2643">If a language is entered here, the filter is used only if the speaker speaks one of the languages listed here. click the button to display a list of languages. you can also select multiple languages if you click the & Ctrl key at the click of the mouse.</seg>
<seg id="2644">If a value is entered here, the filter will only be applied when the text comes from one of the specified applications. you can enter several programs separated by comma. example: conversation, kmail</seg>
<seg id="2645">You can get the application ID running programs with the program qdbus; The & dbus; numbers must be omitted. if for example & qdbus; the application ID copied-3432 indicates, you may only enter copies.</seg>
<seg id="2646">The string replacement filter is applied only to the text if all conditions apply with an entry in the box Diesen Filter when matching. if all input fields are empty, the filter is applied to all texts.</seg>
<seg id="2647">When comparing words, the string replacement filter uses regular expressions in the form\\ s word\\ s. so the words must be limited to both sides by separator (spaces).</seg>
<seg id="2648">In this manual, you will find no instructions for writing regular expressions. but if you have installed the & # 160; for & # 160; regular & # 160; regular & # 160; regular & # 160; for & # 160; for & # 160; Regular & # 160; expressions can be found in the package ambiguls.</seg>
<seg id="2649">XML; Transformer translates & XML; with the help of XSLT files from a format to another format. XSLT (XML; Style Language - Transforms) is a W3C standard for such conversions. it can only be applied to well formed XML. the xsltproc utility must be installed on your system.</seg>
<seg id="2650">Enter the path for the program xsltproc. if xsltproc is reachable via the environment variable PATH, xsltproc is also sufficient.</seg>
<seg id="2651">With the Speaker selection filter, you can send texts to a specific speaker that is set up on the card board speaker, or to a speaker with specific features. for example, you can specify that text by kmail should be read by a female voice.</seg>
<seg id="2652">Before & ktats; passes a text to the filter, it looks for a spokesman for the text. the speaker is selected based on the speaker properties that the program specifies the text to & ktts; the speaker can overwrite the selected speaker using the speaker's selection filter.</seg>
<seg id="2653">If a value is entered here, the filter will be applied if the text contains the entered regular expression. is on your system the & Kde; editor & # 160; for & # 160; regular & # 160; terms installed, you can call this by clicking on the button to get help when entering.</seg>
<seg id="2654">To achieve faster processing, you should try to anchor the regular expression at the beginning of the string, i.e., start the regular expression with &lt;! [CDATA [^]] &gt;.</seg>
<seg id="2655">Specify the characteristics of the speaker you want. if the text meets the filter conditions shown above, the speaker is selected to match the desired requirements. click the button on the right to see the dialog box selection.</seg>
<seg id="2656">Use these buttons to save or load your voice settings or to delete all settings.</seg>
<seg id="2657">The speech selection filter is applied only to the text if all conditions apply with an entry in the box Diesen Filter when apply. you must enter at least one condition.</seg>
<seg id="2658">The voice output API, von & kde;, with which programmers can give their applications TTS skills. applications communicate with KTTSD via & dbus;.</seg>
<seg id="2659">The KTTSD module API, can be added to KTTSD with the voice synthesizer, so you can use this synthesizer.</seg>
<seg id="2660">The following section contains a short description of the & kde; -DBus; -interface of the language output API of & kde; the full documentation for both APIs will be found on the kde; Accessibility website (http: / / accessibility.kde.org).</seg>
<seg id="2661">Applications require voice output services via the & dbus; interface from & kde; from the kttsd program to the object KSpeech.</seg>

<seg id="2664">Open two & Console; -windows. only start kttsd in one window, then kttsmgr in the other.</seg>
<seg id="2665">None of the mentioned language synthesizers supports my language. where can I get a synthesizer for my language?</seg>
<seg id="2666">I have set up the & HTML; -XML; -Forward filter, but when using the module for festival web pages are not read.</seg>
<seg id="2667">Due to an error in Festival 1.95 beta you have to install the (male UK) voice rab _ diphone to make Sable work at all. you must do this even if you do not use this voice to read web pages. also make sure the program xsltproc is installed and can be found via the environment variable PATH.</seg>
<seg id="2668">Certain characters or punctuation marks appear to cause mistakes in synthesizers so that whole sets are skipped or only Kauderwelsh is spent. what can I do about it?</seg>
<seg id="2669">First make sure that the encoding option is set to the correct value for the corresponding language. if there are problems with certain characters or words, these may be corrected by a string replacement filter. see.</seg>

<seg id="2671">The voice synthesizers used by & ktts have their own license which you can find in the related documentation or on the respective websites. there are also voices that have their own license.</seg>
<seg id="2672">If you have access to the KDE source code archive, you can download the package cdeable with & ktts; you can find it in the kttsd folder. you can also find the source code of cdeable under ftp: / / ftp.kde.org / pub / kde /.</seg>

<seg id="2675">KTTS works with any voice synthesizer, which can be started on the command line in a console.</seg>
<seg id="2676">The list of languages mentioned above may be incomplete or outdated. therefore, consult the description of the synthesizer to the supported languages. see also on the website of ktts;, for information that are not yet contained in this manual.</seg>
<seg id="2677">The "speech-dispatcher" program uses an adaptable module architecture for voice synthesizers. if you want to extend the use of a different synthesizer, contact the developer team.</seg>
<seg id="2678">The xsltproc program is used for the support of SSML and for the & XML; -conversion filter, but is not mandatory. Debian users can install xsltproc using the apt-get install xsltproc command.</seg>
<seg id="2679">To compile and tact, you need a current development environment of KDE (version 3.4 or later) including packages of kdelibs and development files for the "speech-dispatcher" program.</seg>
<seg id="2680">If you refer to the source code of & ktts; refer to cdeable from the source code archive or download the tarball created every night, compile and install the program with the following commands:</seg>
<seg id="2681">Before you start & tact, first check if speech dispatcher works correctly with your voice synthesizer. to do this, you can use the shell script spd-conf.</seg>
<seg id="2682">& ktts; in & kde; 4.4 is the first version of & ktts; the program kttmsgr should be developed in such a way that the establishment of speech patchers is directly possible and the script spd-conf is no longer needed.</seg>
<seg id="2683">A long text is decomposed into individual sentences. the user can go back to propositional or paragraph mode, repeat, pause or cancel the output.</seg>
<seg id="2684">If an application passes text to & ktts, it can specify the characteristics of the preferred speaker for output. if you have set up a speaker whose language is English and its gender female, it will be used, otherwise the best suitable speaker will be chosen.</seg>
<seg id="2685">When you click Add Subscribe to Add a spokesman to the list, or click Edit, the card board speaker setup will be shown. as an example, the setup of the module for Festival Interactive is shown below. for details on the modules, please refer to.</seg>
<seg id="2686">Enter the path to the executable festival program. if the path to the festival is included in PATH, just enter the festival.</seg>
<seg id="2687">Select the character encoding for text that is passed to festival. in voices, the & ktats; known, this setting is automatically made. generally, Western languages use ISO 8859-1, Eastern languages such as Czech or Slovak use ISO 8859-2.</seg>
<seg id="2688">With these sliders you can adjust volume, speech velocity and pitch of the synthetic language. if you cannot select some controls and appear in grey, the voice you choose does not allow these settings to be displayed.</seg>
<seg id="2689">Some voices like MultiSyn voices need to be loaded several seconds due to their size. if you mark this check box, these voices are already loaded at the start of KTTSD so that the first movement is synthesized faster (with greater memory consumption).</seg>
<seg id="2690">If this check box cannot be selected, you have not yet created a speaker (or click Apply to click on the user).</seg>
<seg id="2691">If this check box is selected, the kttsmgr program window is displayed at the start of kttsmgr. otherwise, only the kttsmgr icon is visible in the system section after the start, but not the program window. click the icon in the system section to see the program window.</seg>
<seg id="2692">If this check box is selected and kttsmgr is not running, it will appear in the system area as soon as KTTSD reads a text.</seg>
<seg id="2693">Here all orders are listed in queue, along with the application that has set the order, the current status of the order, the number of sentences and the currently edited set. the speaker ID corresponds to the ID of the ID on the card card speaker.</seg>
<seg id="2694">With the buttons in this series, you can move forward or backward in the order selected in the list below. (but not every order consists of several sets).</seg>
<seg id="2695">With a click on OK, all changes in the settings (also on the other flashcards) are taken over and kttsmgr is reduced to the symbol in the system section. then click on this icon to display the program window again.</seg>
<seg id="2696">If the sound system & arts; not installed but instead ALSA, GStreamer or aKode, click on the audio card audio. see also.</seg>

<seg id="2699">If GStreamer or aKode is to be used for audio output, select the audio output here. if no output modules are displayed in the list, you must install at least one module. if you have selected ALSA, select the PCM device here.</seg>
<seg id="2700">Set the subscriber speed here. 50free;% equals about half and 200nbsp;% about twice the normal chat speed. to allow these settings to be implemented, the program must be sox installed.</seg>
<seg id="2701">Click Apply to take over the new settings for the current & Desktop; system.</seg>
<seg id="2702">The list of ALSA devices includes all PCM devices and modules installed in your system. most of them will not work. you will need to find out which device works with you. in doubt choose standard.</seg>
<seg id="2703">On this map menu you can set up special actions that will always be executed when the text order is interrupted by a message with higher priority. & ktts; processes four types of voice orders:</seg>
<seg id="2704">The output of screen readers has the highest priority. it is preferred to all other orders and keeps these orders. after the output of the screen reader has been read, the sustained orders are resumed.</seg>
<seg id="2705">Warnings have the highest priority. this level is important news such as & eg; processor is reserved too hot. a warning keeps the output of messages and normal text. these orders are resumed after reading the warning.</seg>
<seg id="2706">Messages have the next priority. a message interrupts normal text. & kmouth; is an example of an application that pronounces messages. if you & eg; just read a long text on a website, you can still welcome someone who just enters the room.</seg>
<seg id="2707">A text order is interrupted by a message, warning or output of a screen reader, adds & tts; the audio output in the queue.</seg>
<seg id="2708">This audio file is always played when a normal text order is interrupted. if both the introductory sound and the introductory message are active, the introductory sound will be played in front of the introductory message.</seg>
<seg id="2709">The settings on this card are only valid for normal text orders. there are no special actions for messages, warnings, and the output of screen readers if they are interrupted by a message with higher priority.</seg>
<seg id="2710">To read with & ktats, read the Notify messages, launch tmgr and click Notifications. the card card notification appears.</seg>
<seg id="2711">Check this check box to enable the reading of & kde; notifications. if this setting is not selected, the other settings are disabled and & ktts; do not read alerts.</seg>
<seg id="2712">When this setting is selected, notifications in which a sound is played, are read by & ktts; not read.</seg>
<seg id="2713">Use these buttons to add events to the list or delete it. when you click on the Add button, a dialog appears where you can select the application and event you want to add to the list.</seg>
<seg id="2714">This event reads the message, the & Conversation; sends out if someone mentions your nickname in an IRC message.</seg>
<seg id="2715">All events for which nothing else is specified in the list are ignored by & ktts; ignored.</seg>
<seg id="2716">Use this selector to specify what & tts; do when an event occurs. you have the following choices:</seg>
<seg id="2717">If you have selected user-defined text, enter the desired text. you can use the following placeholders:</seg>
<seg id="2718">You can enter here the characteristics of the desired speaker. standard selects the speaker that is shown as the top entry in the list on the card card speaker. see also.</seg>
<seg id="2719">Note that there are three levels for events. if an action is specified for a specific event of a particular application, it will be executed. otherwise, the action will be executed for all other events of the particular application. as the last option, the action will be applied which was specified under standard (all other events).</seg>
<seg id="2720">The event All notifications for the Application Standard (all other events cannot be deleted from the list. for this purpose, you can set the notifications to be read as follows:</seg>
<seg id="2721">Use the Save button to save the settings for the alerts to a file. use the Load button to load saved settings from a file. the loaded events will be merged with the events listed in the list. if you want to start an empty list, click Delete. all entries except all notifications will be deleted.</seg>
<seg id="2722">The Speech Synthesis Markup Language (SSML) is a W3C standard to select text for voice output. this standard includes marks for controlling voices, speaking speed, volume, sex of voice and pitch.</seg>
<seg id="2723">Currently supported & ktts; SSML only partially and only in the basic functions. the following restrictions are available:</seg>
<seg id="2724">You must install the rab _ diphone voice (British male), as this is the standard voice, the festival uses the output of SSML.</seg>
<seg id="2725">If the settings for speed or pitch in the festival configuration dialog are not set to 100mt.;%, SSML text is usually spoken very monotonously.</seg>
<seg id="2726">&lt;! [CDATA [&lt;? XML version = "1.0" encoding = "UTF-8"? &gt; &lt;! doctype speak PUBLIC "- / / www.w3.org / TR / speech synthesis / synthesis.dtd" &gt; Who slept in my bed? asked Mama Bär. who slept in my bed? asked the bear child.]] &gt;</seg>
<seg id="2727">There are two types of filters - normal filters and punctuation detection filters (SDB filters). SBDs subdivide the text into single sentences. this can be done faster with the preread, since only the first proposition must be synthesized, not the entire text order. thus, you can also jump or stop writing assignments on the card card, even if the voice synthesizer does not directly support this.</seg>
<seg id="2728">Here you can see the punctuation detection filter. at the first start of & ktts, a set limit detection filter is set up automatically. you can change its settings or add further set-level detection filters, but beginners will not be discouraged.</seg>
<seg id="2729">The easiest way to learn is to set up the speaker selection by selecting. turn off the speaker selection and select text to read. check the speaker selection, change some features and check how the selection of the speaker changes. to do so you have to have more than one speaker installed, otherwise the filter is ineffective.</seg>
<seg id="2730">& ktts; then start reading faster, since only the first set has to be processed and not the whole text block, which can take a long time,</seg>
<seg id="2731">You can then pause or cancel jobs on the card card, even if the voice synthesizer does not support this function.</seg>
<seg id="2732">For these reasons, the standard set-level detection filter is automatically set up when you start kttsmgr for the first time. it cannot be turned off, only removed. do not change anything on this filter unless you know what you are doing.</seg>
<seg id="2733">Set limits identification filters compare text with a regular expression for set-ends and add a tab character (Decimal code 8) to the set limits (tab characters are automatically removed from the text before filtering). note that the default punctuation filter maintains the punctuation.</seg>
<seg id="2734">SBD filters are never applied to & kde; messages (knotify), warnings, messages or the output of screen readers.</seg>
<seg id="2735">If you have removed the standard set limit detection filter, you can insert it again by reloading the file standard _ sbdrc included in & ktops.</seg>
<seg id="2736">You can override the speaker settings for the application on the map menu. the card card is displayed when</seg>
<seg id="2737">Use of the standard speaker (the top one on the card card speaker). in other words: there won't be any speech features.</seg>
<seg id="2738">Use the most suitable speaker, which displays all the features of a set-up speaker. if you do not delete or edit the speaker's settings, select & ktts; this speaker. otherwise select & ktts; the speaker that most likely corresponds to the originally set features.</seg>
<seg id="2739">Select the method to enter the desired speaker properties by clicking on one of the selection buttons.</seg>
<seg id="2740">Select the characteristics of the desired speaker here. if this feature does not matter, enter nothing.</seg>
<seg id="2741">Select this check box if the property should have precedence over other properties. you can also set several flags here.</seg>
<seg id="2742">Since the language is a critical factor when understanding the output, it is always treated as the priority property. you will rarely use this property. the only case where you may want to specify the attribute language is, if you know that a certain application text is sent in a different language than the one in the working environment.</seg>
<seg id="2743">To use all the features in the Speaker section, which is most likely to delete the following, click the default spokesman button and then use the speaker that is the closest to the following.</seg>
<seg id="2744">In this case 0 stands for the last text order in the queue. you can also specify an order number. (without order number the input 0 is required).</seg>
<seg id="2745">Kttsmgr crashes when it is started. I compiled Debug support, but I don't get backtracking.</seg>
<seg id="2746">GStreamer 0.8.x crashes. you may need to register GStreamer. if the problem is not resolved by this, a non-compatible version of GStreamer will be installed. you can try to update or uninstall GStreamer.</seg>
<seg id="2747">The audio output via ALSA does not work if I play music at the same time using another application. if I receive a text order, freezes & ktts; one. on the console; appears a message saying: Unable to open PCM.</seg>
<seg id="2748">There is a problem on your system that conflicts with ALSA are occurring that prevent the simultaneous opening of multiple PCM devices. you can find clues for possible solutions on the website of the ALSA project (dmix) at www.alsa-project.org.</seg>
<seg id="2749">I have uploaded an additional voice for festival from the Internet. I have installed it and can use it in festival, but kttsmgr does not show this voice.</seg>
<seg id="2750">Add the new voice in the $KDEHOME / share / apps / kttsd / festivalint / Tournaments file. if this is successful, please send a patch along with the URL; on which you have found the voice, to the developers.</seg>
<seg id="2751">On the map menu audio, there is a setting speed. for this to work, the program must be installed sox and be traceable via the environment variable PATH. some Synthesizermodules like Festival Interactive even offer a setting for speed on the map for subscriber devices. depending on the chosen voice, it is active or inactive.</seg>
<seg id="2752">The settings for the speech velocity will be ignored if & ktts; & HTML; reads. (this is because the HTML is transformed into SSML.) Remove either the filter for the conversion of & HTML; according to & XML; (see) or, if you are very brave, change the .xsl file of the & HTML; -after-SSML deformerfilter, and set up the subscriber speed.</seg>
<seg id="2753">I don't manage to read websites with a female voice. I have set up a female festival spokesman, but & ktts; reads the websites with a male voice.</seg>
<seg id="2754">With Festival 1.95 beta, the day Sable GENDER does not seem to work. so that festival does not produce errors, the xsl file rejects the GENDER-tags to convert SSML to Saber-tags. the same applies to the VOICE tags.</seg>
<seg id="2755">I have added a string replacement filter and now I can do it in & ktts; no longer set or go back. orders are displayed on the trunner, the job consists only of one sentence. what am I doing wrong?</seg>
<seg id="2756">Punctuation marks (point, question mark, exclamation point, comma and semicolon) are not allowed to filter out. instead use a filter for punctuation detection instead.</seg>
<seg id="2757">Alsa (Advanced & Linux; Sound Architecture). Alsa is on most systems with & Linux; already installed. (www.alsa-project.org)</seg>
<seg id="2758">GStreamer in version 0.8.7 or later. note: make sure the modules are registered for GStreamer by calling the command register before using GStreamer. (HTTP: / / gstreamer.freedesktop.org)</seg>
<seg id="2759">Some users experience in connection with ALSA conflicts during the audio output. if your system also counts, you cannot simultaneously play music and read a text. & ktats; also freeze if you stop a text order and then start another. possible solutions for this problem can be found on the website of ALSA (dmix).</seg>
<seg id="2760">With stand July 2005 aKode does not support real breaks yet. if you hold a text order in & ktts, the current set will be read yet.</seg>
<seg id="2761">The audio program sox is used for the general setting of the speaking speed, but is otherwise not mandatory. Debian users can install sox using the apt-get install sox command. the program is on most & Linux; -CDs already included.</seg>
<seg id="2762">If you have downloaded & tts; as tarball (with tar packeted archive), log in as normal user and unpack the tarball into a matching folder. switch to this folder and enter the following commands:</seg>
<seg id="2763">In & kde; 4 is the module & arts; probably removed or at least only created on request.</seg>
<seg id="2764">The following modules for voice synthesizers are created by default. some of them have run time dependency of non-free software. (non-free according to the Debian distribution guidelines). the configure option column shows the configure parameter that causes the creation of the creation.</seg>
<seg id="2765">Default is & ktts; in / opt / kde3 installed. if this folder is not listed in the environment variable $KDEDIRS, you must specify as an option --prefix = Target. for example</seg>
<seg id="2766">On Debian systems, / usr / local is the right folder for programs to be translated from sources.</seg>
<seg id="2767">CD-apps make -f Makefile.cvs. / configure cd kttsd make su make install</seg>
<seg id="2768">Before you start & tts, first check if your voice synthesizer works properly. follow the instructions you have received with the synthesizer.</seg>
<seg id="2769">Festival is one of the best free TTS synthesizers whose source code is open. the quality of the voices is generally good, and multiple voices and languages are supported.</seg>
<seg id="2770">You need to install at least one language. help is found in the instructions supplied with the festival. if you want to read websites, you need to install the (male UK) voice rab _ diphone.</seg>
<seg id="2771">For these voices you need to compile an additional module, so you need the source code of the festival. the German voices are subject to restrictions on sharing.</seg>
<seg id="2772">This voice presupposes Festival 1.95 beta or newer. the voice is still at an early stage of development. if you set up the Russian voices, you need to enter the voices MSU _ ru _ NSH _ diphone. select a Cyrillic (8-bit) encoding as for example koi8-R.</seg>
<seg id="2773">Festival is usually included in the & Linux distributions. therefore, find the festival first on the CDs of your distribution.</seg>
<seg id="2774">If you want to use the Polish, Hungarian or Czech languages, the encoding option has to be set to ISO 8859-2.</seg>
<seg id="2775">If you want to use the Russian voice, the encoding option must be set to an 8 bit cyrillic such as koi8-R.</seg>
<seg id="2776">Festival can be used together with the MBROLA, synthesizer. then Festival takes over the lexical analysis and & MBROLA; generates the audio output from it. the & MBROLA; program and the & MBROLA; voices can be downloaded from</seg>
<seg id="2777">Note that & MBROLA; no complete voice output system is. & MBROLA; generates language from Diphon files. you need additional software to create these DiPhones.

<seg id="2794">Start kttmsgr. click Add. select the Czech or Slovakian language and EPs TTS language synthesizer. if the epos programs do not stand in your PATH, enter the path to the programs on the map menu. in the input fields, you can enter additional parameters for the programs. enter in a & console; epic -h or say -h to get more information.</seg>
<seg id="2795">FreeTTS is a free, quelloid voice synthesizer, which was written in & Java; i.e. you must install the & Java; Virtual Machine on your system. with & Java; you can set neither pitch, volume nor speech speed.</seg>
<seg id="2796">The command module allows you to use & ktops; with any voice synthesizer that can be activated in a & console; on the command line.</seg>
<seg id="2797">Best use a command that writes the voice output to a temporary audio file (wav) instead of sending the output directly to the audio device</seg>
<seg id="2798">This manual explains the installation and use of & cnetworkconf;, a module for the & ccontrolcenter; that allows management of network interfaces, routing and DNS settings.</seg>
<seg id="2799">The & kcontrolcenter; allows the user to manage a number of system and desktop settings via a uniform, integrated interface. the & kcontrolcenter; can be called by selecting K Menu kcontrolcenter;</seg>
<seg id="2800">The & knetworkconf; package is designed to allow users to manage TCP / IP network settings in the same way as other settings from the & ccontrolcenter; create a simple interface for the user:</seg>
<seg id="2801">After installation, a new module network settings will be displayed in the & ccontrolcenter; the module Network Settings (knetworkconf) can be started by selecting kcontrolcenter; Internet & Network Network Settings in & KMenu.</seg>
<seg id="2802">It is important to understand that & knetworkconf; network hardware cannot install. physical devices and their drivers need to be fully installed and configured to allow & knetworkconf; the device at all shows and allows the setting of the network properties.</seg>
<seg id="2803">In most cases, drivers for network hardware and other devices are installed and installed while installing & Linux. if network devices are added later, the drivers need to be loaded by adjusting the following files according to the kernel version:</seg>
<seg id="2804">The Network Settings module is loaded when the Network Settings option is selected in & ccontrolcenter; -Index. when starting module network settings, this will automatically detect the used platform on the system.</seg>
<seg id="2805">If the platform cannot be detected, the manual selection is offered. it is the platform from the list that best matches the distribution and release status. selecting non-re-enquiries can be made permanently.</seg>
<seg id="2806">Changing network settings is only possible in system management mode. previously, all options are displayed in grey, meaning the settings can only be viewed, changing is not possible. in system management mode, click the button System Administration Mode at the lower end of the module. it is required to enter the password.</seg>
<seg id="2807">In the system management mode, the entire functionality of the module is available. it is divided into three tabs:</seg>
<seg id="2808">The Rider Network interfaces are used to manage the network devices of the system. all available network devices are displayed. the following tasks can be performed by the Reiter Network interfaces:</seg>
<seg id="2809">The settings displayed by displayed network interfaces can be set up by selecting the desired device in the list and clicking the button interface... in the Device Dialog box.</seg>
<seg id="2810">By default, only basic TCP / IP settings are available. click the Advanced Settings button to display the dialog with further options.</seg>
<seg id="2811">With the Automatically selection, the TCP / IP settings are fetched from a DHCP server or BOOTP server. in automatic mode, TCP / IP settings for the system are carried out simultaneously with the start of the system services. the DHCP- or BOOTP server sends all necessary TCP / IP information for each system start, therefore no further setting is required. in the selection list, either DHCP or BOOTP server can be selected according to the system.</seg>
<seg id="2812">The manual can be configured with the TCP / IP configuration without DHCP or BOOTP. in the input field IP address the desired TCP / IP address must be specified.</seg>
<seg id="2813">If this setting is selected, the system initializes the network interface when booting. if the initialization is not desired, this option should not be activated.</seg>
<seg id="2814">The values entered in this dialog are displayed as properties of the device in the device list.</seg>
<seg id="2815">It should be ensured that the IP address in the network is not already used. entering an existing IP address would lead to a TCP / IP conflict. ping in the & console; you can determine if the desired address is already in use. in doubt, the network administrator should be asked.</seg>
<seg id="2816">Network devices can be turned on or off according to requirements. switching on an outdated network device can be activated by selecting from the list and clicking on interface....</seg>
<seg id="2817">Network devices can be turned on or off according to requirements. disabling an activated network device can be disabled by selecting from the list and clicking on interface....</seg>
<seg id="2818">Specifies the IP address of the host on the local subnet, which mediates the physical connection to remote networks and is used as standard for TCP / IP communication with hosts in other subnets.</seg>
<seg id="2819">If there is more than one network interface on the computer, the interface must be selected to the network in which the gateway computer is located.</seg>
<seg id="2820">A host with DNS support replaces a complete domain name by the corresponding IP address. this is necessary because computers only understand IP addresses. if the host requests http: / / www.einedomain.org, DNS will resolve this name to an IP address such as 123.45.678.90.</seg>
<seg id="2821">The name resolution part of the name resolution calculator allows easy management of this list. entries can be added, removed or altered. DNS records can be grouped in priority by selecting an entry and / or grading in the list with the buttons adding or downgrading.</seg>
<seg id="2822">By clicking the button Add... from the group host to the name resolution, a DNS server can be added. it will be added to the New Name Server dialog.</seg>
<seg id="2823">First, enter the IP address of the DNS server and then click the Add button. the entry is then inserted in the list.</seg>
<seg id="2824">From the group calculator to name resolution, select an entry and then click the Edit button.... Edit dialog will display.</seg>
<seg id="2825">The list name calculator specifies hostname-to-IP address links for the TCP / IP subsystem. it is primarily used when booting when no DNS servers are available. in small, closed networks, it can replace DNS servers.</seg>
<seg id="2826">The list usually contains some entries, which support & apos; localhostapos; and some special IPv6 addresses. this still in the test version of IP will replace in future version 4.</seg>
<seg id="2827">Enter the IP address of the known computer and click Add... Add the New Alias dialog.</seg>
<seg id="2828">Enter the name of the familiar computer and click the Add button. if the well-known host has multiple alias names, press the Add button multiple times and enter the other alias names.</seg>
<seg id="2829">Select an entry of a name-known computer from the list and select Edit.... The dialog Converted Calculator will be displayed.</seg>
<seg id="2830">It can be executed one of the following tasks, then clicking OK will update the list of static hosts.</seg>
<seg id="2831">The settings made in the module network settings are not immediately effective in the system. to activate the changes must be set in a & Console; the following command must be set.</seg>
<seg id="2832">The homepage of & knetworkconf; is http: / / knetworkconf.sourceforge.net, from which you can download the latest version of the source code.</seg>
<seg id="2833">For the installation of binary distributions (mostly rpm packages) it is sufficient if & kde; and Qt are installed.</seg>
<seg id="2834">The installation of the compiled version is recommended for less experienced users. it is easy to download the rpm package and install in a & console; with rpm as follows:</seg>
<seg id="2835">Alternatively, a tool can be used with graphical interface like kpackage or the installation tool of their distribution.</seg>
<seg id="2836">For this case, the installation of Qt and & kde does not suffice, but additionally the development packages are needed with libraries and other things.</seg>
<seg id="2837">This is recommended only to experienced users. however, it is not difficult to compile and compile the following commands.</seg>
<seg id="2838">In the first section of this chapter, important information about basic network technology is given, in the second section all of & knetworkconf; change configuration files will be discussed.</seg>
<seg id="2839">This section cannot replace further knowledge about IP networks. in this appendix only basic information about the integration of the PC into a small (home) network is mediated.</seg>
<seg id="2840">IP networks are currently being operated with TCP / IP version 4 (IPv4). IPv5 has never found any major dissemination. IPv6 is expected to be implemented in the near future.</seg>
<seg id="2841">One of the most important information is to know which IP address of a network interface is to be assigned. in foreign networks, at & eg; workplace, the network administrator is the contact person that assigns a valid IP address or, if available, DHCP can be used.</seg>
<seg id="2842">When setting up your own small (home) network, the IP address should be selected from a reserved area specifically reserved for this purpose in order to avoid IP address conflicts with the global (Internet) network. the addresses from the table below are not forwarded on the Internet, so any use is possible.</seg>
<seg id="2843">Of course, access to the Internet can be enabled for such machines by setting a gateways.</seg>
<seg id="2844">For smaller networks, addresses in the range from 192.168.1.1 to 192.168.1.254 are used. the range is large enough for networks up to 250 computers.</seg>
<seg id="2845">In addition, the netmask is usually set to 255.255.255.0, so that all hosts are participants in the same subnet.</seg>
<seg id="2846">Some addresses are reserved for special things, 0.0eg; .0.0 and 127.0.0.1. the first is the so-called standard route, the second is the loopback address (localhost = your own computer). the default route is required for the IP forwarding.</seg>
<seg id="2847">The network address 127.0.0.1 is reserved for IP traffic in the local machine. normally, the address 127.0.0.1 has its own loopback interface, which works like a closed circle.</seg>
<seg id="2848">In this part you will find the configuration files that are affected by & knetworkconf and where they are stored in the various distributions.</seg>
<seg id="2849">This file is sometimes dynamically changed in DSL connections, so it will not be surprised if other content than specified there is found in the case of active DSL connections.</seg>
<seg id="2850">For & SuSE; it is known that this file is sorted by the scripts in SuSEconfig. a different status than expected may therefore occur.</seg>

<seg id="2893">& kdat; is a backup program for tape drives based on tar. it offers the possibility to store several archives on a tape. the first was to create a surface for tar, which additionally offered the capability of dds2tar for fast, selective unpacking. the second aim was to answer a question that my wife did: how much longer does it take when you secure?</seg>
<seg id="2894">Before a tape can be used it must be included in & kdat; this can be done in three ways:</seg>
<seg id="2895">& kdat; get the tape back and read the pre-tensioning information of the tape. recognize & kdat; don't know the credits on the tape, you'll be asked if the tape should be formatted.</seg>
<seg id="2896">Detects & kdat; the leader, searches for the appropriate index on your disk. if this cannot be found, you will be asked if the band index should be recreated.</seg>
<seg id="2897">If everything went smoothly, the symbol for the tape drive changes to indicate that the tape has been integrated. in the status bar a corresponding message appears. the contents of the tape can now be scanned by unfolding the entry for the tape.</seg>
<seg id="2898">Before throwing the tape, the integration must first be solved. there are three methods to do this:</seg>
<seg id="2899">& kdat; indicates by a change in the symbol for the tape that the integration for the tape has been solved and shows a corresponding message in the Status Bar. the tape can now be ejected without any danger.</seg>
<seg id="2900">Before a tape can be used by & kdat, it must be formatted by & kdat.</seg>
<seg id="2901">A band-type must be formatted before you can use it to store data. this process does not correspond to the formatting at & kdat;. if your tape drive needs to be formatted before use, this must happen before you can be formatted by the tape of & kdat; floppy drives usually require formatting of tape, DAT drives do not.</seg>
<seg id="2902">After entering the band name and capacity goes & kdat; with the tape formatting. all data on the tape is lost! after completion of the formatting process, the tape is automatically mounted and is ready to use.</seg>
<seg id="2903">Before you start the backup process, you must select the files to be secured. this can be done in three ways:</seg>
<seg id="2904">Select a file or folder in the local file tree. only this file or folder is backed up.</seg>
<seg id="2905">Select a backup profile in the tree. only the files specified in the profile will be backed up.</seg>
<seg id="2906">Select files in the local file tree with a tick. only the selected files and / or subfolders are backed up.</seg>
<seg id="2907">Rightclick the local file tree and select in the Save menu...</seg>
<seg id="2908">Once the backup is started, the Settings dialog opens. in this dialog, you can once again check the selected files and change the settings for backup.</seg>
<seg id="2909">The dialog displays the progress of the backup process, including the data rate and the remaining time.</seg>
<seg id="2910">Select a file or folder in one of the archives in the entry for the drive. only the selected file or folder will be checked.</seg>
<seg id="2911">Select the files in one of the archives in the entry for the tape with a tick. only the selected files and / or subfolders are checked.</seg>
<seg id="2912">Right-click in one of the archives and select the menu entry Check.</seg>
<seg id="2913">Once the test procedure has been started, the dialog box for verification will appear. in this dialog you can check your selection again and change the working folder for checking.</seg>
<seg id="2914">If you have confirmed the settings for the verification, the dialog will review. this dialog displays the progress of the audit process as well as the data throughput and the time remaining.</seg>
<seg id="2915">Before you can initiate the restore, the files to be recovered must be selected. this can be done in two ways:</seg>
<seg id="2916">Select a file or folder in one of the archives that belong to the tape drive. only the selected file or subfolder will be recovered.</seg>
<seg id="2917">Select the files you want from one of the archives with a tick. only the selected files and / or subfolders will be recovered.</seg>
<seg id="2918">Right-click on a file or folder in one of the archives and select Restore...</seg>
<seg id="2919">Once the recovery process has been started, the dialog box for recovery appears. in this dialog you can check your selection again and change the working folder for recovery.</seg>
<seg id="2920">If you have confirmed the settings for recovery, the dialog will appear again. this dialog displays the progress of the recovery process as well as the data throughput and the time remaining.</seg>
<seg id="2921">Sometimes it is necessary to recreate the band index file using the tape content. this process deletes all existing index files for this volume. you can create the index on two types of tape:</seg>
<seg id="2922">This creates a backup profile with the currently selected files and the default settings. you can set the following settings for a backup profile:</seg>
<seg id="2923">The current working folder where the backup should take place. the list of files to be secured is automatically updated according to the selected working folder.</seg>
<seg id="2924">For all folders listed under backup files, only the files in it are backed up on the same file system as the folder. folders located on other file systems can be placed separately under backup files. each entry is considered by tar regardless of the other file system.</seg>
<seg id="2925">Incremental backup. to determine which files have changed since the last incremental backup, a snapshot file is used. only the files that have changed since then are backed up.</seg>
<seg id="2926">The name of the file used to determine the changes since the last incremental backup.</seg>
<seg id="2927">Delete the snapshot file before calling tar. this causes all files to be backed up and a new snapshot file is created for the next backup.</seg>
<seg id="2928">The functionality of the buttons files & gt; lt; files were not fully implemented at the time of creating this documentation.</seg>
<seg id="2929">The settings can be set using the menu item KDat... in the Settings menu. you can make the following settings:</seg>
<seg id="2930">The complete path to the device file for the tape drive (usually / dev / tape). this path must point to the non-rewinding version of the tape recorder.</seg>
<seg id="2931">This setting is active, transmitted & kdat; before the tape is mounted, the command mt load to the drive. for some drives this is necessary before reading or writing operations can be performed.</seg>
<seg id="2932">If the option is turned on, try & kdat; block the ejector at the tape drive. possibly this setting does not work on all tape drives.</seg>
<seg id="2933">If the option is enabled, it will automatically eject the tape when unplugging & kdat. do not use this option on floppy ammers.</seg>
<seg id="2934">If the option is turned on, try & kdat, change the hardwarted block size for the tape drive. not all drives support variable block sizes. no matter whether this setting is active or not, you have to tell the block size for your tape drive.</seg>
<seg id="2935">If & kdat; a tape formatted, it writes a file to the beginning of the tape. this file should occupy only one block of memory on the tape. the contents of the file are composed as follows:</seg>
<seg id="2936">(n Byte) The band ID. the format of this string is the hostname: seconds, where hostname is the complete name of the system on which the tape has been formatted. seconds is the number of seconds that have passed since the era in which the band has been formatted.</seg>
<seg id="2937">The band ID is used to find a file with the same name in the file $HOME / .kdat /.</seg>
<seg id="2938">The rest of the files on the tape are pure tar archives, which can be managed directly with & GNU; - tar. even other tar versions should work as long as they are not incremental backups.</seg>
<seg id="2939">Check the content of a backup tape. this icon is only active when a tape is included.</seg>

<seg id="2945">Many other functions are also included and are explained in the further chapters of this manual.</seg>
<seg id="2946">As you see in the screenshots below, you can easily filter and sort the individual protocol lines of a protocol file. the individual options for sorting and filtering are shown in the next chapter of this manual.</seg>
<seg id="2947">After the start & ksystemlog; initially, the most important log file of the system - the system protocol - will open. if you do not display it, and it opens instead of it a small message window, so you have & ksystemlog; most likely not with system administrator privileges.</seg>
<seg id="2948">You can also use the filter bar to filter by a selected criterion or entered strings. the list of log lines is now automatically changed, so that only log lines are displayed that fit to the selected filter. in the default setting, a protocol line is displayed only if the string of the filter string is included in one of the columns.</seg>
<seg id="2949">You can of course select another entry at this point. the string of the filter search term is then matched only with entries in the corresponding column. for example, in the protocol file system protocol, select the column process, and also enter the name of a process in the protocol file, thus showing you & ksystemlog; all protocol lines that were sent or created by this process.</seg>
<seg id="2950">This option is enabled in the default setting and helps you to detect the important protocol lines. protocol lines of level errors are displayed with a conspicuous color as protocol lines of level indication.</seg>
<seg id="2951">If you wish to show only certain processes (for example in the system protocol or in the Cron protocol), you can hide the process identification (PID) in the process column. this can be useful for example if you want to examine the output of a particular command such as the start of the samba server. in this case, use filter bar.</seg>
<seg id="2952">In addition, you can activate the Add to new lines in the main window context menu to display all the new log lines.</seg>
<seg id="2953">& ksystemlog; allows you to view multiple log files in separate sub-windows. to use this feature, use the entries in the menu to open and manage additional sub-windows. once you have selected a subwindow, select a protocol to display in the menu.</seg>
<seg id="2954">& ksystemlog; has its own website on http: / / ksystemlog.forum-software.org. you will find more current information on the Sources of & ksystemlog;.</seg>
<seg id="2955">& ksystemlog; can also be found in the following folder of the & node; -Subversion archive: kesystem log; in & node; -archive</seg>
<seg id="2956">Welcome to & kde; System V Init Editor, rather known (and so named) as & ksysv; this section introduces some concepts and describes what you can do with & ksysv.</seg>
<seg id="2957">System V Init is quickly becoming the standard for the control of program start-up when booting the system in the & Linux world. this is because it is easier to use, more powerful and at the same time more flexible than the traditional BSD-Init.</seg>
<seg id="2958">I will not go further into historical aspects (e.g. because I don't know about it myself: -).</seg>
<seg id="2959">The init binary is under / sbin and not under / etc. this is important because maybe someone could try to switch a machine to System V init without re-installing and re-formatting. that's why you need to make sure that the old init was removed from there if there was one.</seg>
<seg id="2960">The SysV Init differs from the BSD Init that the configuration files are in a subfolder of / etc. this folder is called rc.d. Dort you will find rc.sysinit and the following folders:</seg>
<seg id="2961">Init.d contains a whole lot of scripts. basically you need a script for every system service you want to start at startup of the system or when changing to another run level. system services include such things as network, NFS, & Sendmail;, httpd, etc; system services do not include such things as setserial, which is started only once. such calls belong to rc.local.</seg>
<seg id="2962">Rc.local should be in / etc / rc.d if you need it. most systems have this file, even if there is not much use for it. you can also create a rc.serial in / etc / rc.d if you want to run a rc.serial port if you want to do something with the serial port.</seg>
<seg id="2963">The kernel selects init at various points after the program and starts the first one you find.</seg>
<seg id="2964">The default runtime is entered in / etc / inittab. you should see a line like the following:</seg>
<seg id="2965">At this point, you can take a look at the second column and probably notice that the default RunLevel 3 is. if you want to change that, then you can edit / etc / inittab by hand and change the 3. if you have confused something, then you will repair it by reboot the system and execute the following:</seg>
<seg id="2966">But how does it start all the right scripts? if you type ls -l in rc3.d, then you'll probably see something like the following:</seg>
<seg id="2967">You will notice that there are no real files in this folder. instead, each entry is a link to one of the scripts in the init.d directory.</seg>
<seg id="2968">How to start and stop init actually system services? quite simple: each of the scripts is written in such a way that it accepts an argument as start and stop. you can actually start these scripts from hand on the command line as follows:</seg>
<seg id="2969">This would stop the httpd server. init reads the name, and if the one contains a K, the script is called with the argument stop. if it contains an S, the script is called with the argument start.</seg>
<seg id="2970">Some people want a simple way to set up machines for many purposes. I could have & eg; a server running level that only runs httpd, & sendmail;, network, etc; in addition, I could also have a user runlevel, that & eg; & kdm;, network & etc; runs.</seg>
<seg id="2971">Here you learn the use of & ksysv; it should not be very difficult, because the program was designed as user-friendly as possible.</seg>
<seg id="2972">The use of & ksysv; with a mouse or another pointer is simple to not say trivial: simply drag an entry from the range of available system services to one of the six runlevels to start it on this level (or stop).</seg>
<seg id="2973">You can also move the scripts between Runleveled or move the position within a level by pulling it somewhere else. in doing so, the entry is removed from its original running level (or its position). this will only happen if you extract an entry from the range of available system services.</seg>
<seg id="2974">Note: entries are moved when you drag them to a new area. to simply copy them to a new run level, you must explicitly select Copy from the Edit menu or from the contextual menu and insert it into the target area -- even if the same entry has previously been in the target area of the action.</seg>
<seg id="2975">The sort number of an entry can sometimes not be computed. in such a case, you need to edit the sorting numbers of the surrounding entries before attempting to insert the system service again.</seg>
<seg id="2976">Note: currently there is no way to recover entries that have been thrown into the Recycle Bin. so be careful.</seg>
<seg id="2977">You can use the Tabulator key to activate the different work areas (Available System Services, Runlevel 1 Start, Runtime 1 Stop & etc;) as well as the cursor keys to make a selection above or below the previous one.</seg>
<seg id="2978">To move an entry into another running level, move it with cutting into the clipboard (you can also use Ctrl; X) and insert it into the desired running level with insert (with Ctrl; V).</seg>
<seg id="2979">To change the sorting number or the name of an entry manually, press the Enter key to open the Properties dialog. use the Tab key to switch between different fields. close the dialog by pressing the input button to accept the changes, or press Esc to discard the changes.</seg>
<seg id="2980">Because of the risk of data loss, all entries in the File menu require a confirmation before they are executed.</seg>
<seg id="2981">All settings are stored in $KDEHOME / share / config / ksysvrc. defaults are removed from the global file ($KDEDIR / share / config / ksysvrc), if available. otherwise, they will be restored by & ksysv; settings are stored in a local ksysvrc.</seg>
<seg id="2982">I experimented with the standard runlevels, and now the machine is getting started anew. what can I do?</seg>
<seg id="2983">Enter the LILO prompt linux single and press the input button to start in single use mode. then edit the file / etc / inittab and change the default runtime to a reasonable value (3 should normally be fine).</seg>
<seg id="2984">I have some system services with & ksysv; running under Runlevel X, but they are not executed.</seg>
<seg id="2985">If you use & SuSE; or Delix (DLD), you need to edit additional files in / etc that are only present in these distributions. please read the details in the Distribution Guide.</seg>
<seg id="2986">The way system services are launched in these distributions simplifies the configuration for the proprietary setup programs of these distributions, but unfortunately does not meet any standard. the authors of & ksysv; plan an extension of the program for this approach.</seg>
<seg id="2987">If you are using another distribution, please check that all configuration files are provided by the respective system service (and also whether they are in the correct directory). some services (such as & eg; Apache and httpd) simply end without notice if their configuration files are not present or incorrectly configured.</seg>
<seg id="2988">The meaning of the & Linux; runtime varies from distribution to distribution, can even be different from version to version. if you are using another distribution, please send me information on the running level so that it can be added to this manual.</seg>
<seg id="2989">This documentation refers to & kuser; 1.0. with this program you can manage the users and groups of your system.</seg>
<seg id="2990">To start with & kuser; it is sufficient to read the chapter customization by & kuser;</seg>
<seg id="2991">After you have made changes, you must save them. either use the appropriate icon of the toolbar or the Save in the File menu.</seg>
<seg id="2992">The main window consists of two flashcards, the user and the user group list. to edit, select the desired user or the desired group by double-clicking on the entry.</seg>
<seg id="2993">Some flashcards are only displayed if you have advanced system settings. only when you have enabled space constraints (quota) for users will create a card card on which you can make individual settings. other flashcards appear if shadow passwords or for example / etc / master.passwd are installed like in BSD Unix.</seg>
<seg id="2994">The password management card card appears if shadow passwords or for example / etc / master.passwd are installed like in BSD Unix.</seg>
<seg id="2995">This card card only appears if for at least one integrated filesystem space restriction (quota) is enabled and initialized (recognizable by the quota user / quota group file on the file system).</seg>
<seg id="2996">These parameters can be set individually for each filesystem. the current filesystem is selected using the File System with space limitation</seg>
<seg id="2997">The Cartridge Groups inform groups about the group belonging to the selected user. the default group, to which the user belongs, can be found in the Primur Group field. furthermore, the user can become a member in other groups by selecting them in the large field.</seg>
<seg id="2998">The Group's dialog features a list of all users. to add a user to the group, select this user in the list.</seg>
<seg id="2999">To add a user or group, select Add from the User or Group menu or click the appropriate Add button on the toolbar. editing or deleting the selected user respectively the selected group works analogous.</seg>
<seg id="3000">With this module, you can install the LILO boot manager, add, remove and change boot password, change the time to boot the default operating system, add, remove, change operating systems, remove, change, and more.</seg>
