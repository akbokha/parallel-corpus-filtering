although I had visited the USA at least once a year since 2012 , I would now live there for the first time .
and that was very exciting for me .
my love for America is exceptionally great .
like many of my generation , I also grew up with American movies , d@@ anced to American music , read American authors and operated his sport .
in fact , this country had such a profound effect on me that I became a journalist mainly because of an American film .
as a 14 @-@ year @-@ old , I saw the great D@@ enz@@ el Washington , as he played the Gra@@ y Gran@@ th@@ am in The Peli@@ can letter , a fear@@ less repor@@ ter who covered the mur@@ der@@ ous conspiracy of an oil @-@ mag@@ n@@ ate with the help of Julia Rober@@ ts , who wanted to occupy the top federal court with judges who were inclined to his interest .
I was trapped .
free to Method Man , &quot; I was , as if it was the absolute truth , forget everything else , that &apos;s what I want to do with my life . &quot;
and the year I lived in Arizona had only increased my admir@@ ation for the US .
I always said : &quot; America is the only country I &apos;ve ever lived , whose diversity is so inviting that you can always be who you are and it is easy to find acceptance in a community of like @-@ minded people .
I even had written a very black@@ ish love letter about his great@@ ness .
then Donald Tr@@ ump came .
much was written about the x@@ en@@ opho@@ bia and rac@@ ism of this man .
the most extraordinary aspect of his ascension is for me , how he deals with his narrow @-@ min@@ de@@ dness .
he never stays behind the mountain with his opinion , as he says so beautifully .
he says exactly what he thinks , as a former colleague puts it , and openly declares his cont@@ emp@@ t for Muslims , Lat@@ inos , Af@@ ro @-@ Americans and women .
nevertheless , people responded to his statements and voted for him in dro@@ ves .
the 13 million votes he gained in the Republi@@ can prim@@ aries was the highest number ever reached by the nom@@ in@@ ee nom@@ in@@ ee .
I was spe@@ ech@@ less .
who are the Americans who support this big@@ oted person , I asked myself ?
I could not harmon@@ ize Tr@@ ump and his voters with the people I had met in Phoenix during my time .
like my professor , Dr. Bill Sil@@ cock , director of the journ@@ alism programme , who receives people from all over the world , a deeply believing man with whom I could talk about Islam and his past .
Tr@@ um@@ ps Wel@@ tan@@ schau@@ ung also agreed not with Peter Bh@@ ati@@ a , the current editor of the &quot; C@@ inc@@ inn@@ ati In@@ qu@@ ir@@ er . &quot;
Bh@@ ati@@ a and I met with our shared love for basketball and we spent many hours watching the &quot; Phoenix S@@ uns &quot; at the game .
Tr@@ um@@ ps Int@@ oler@@ ance is also in stark contrast to the gener@@ osity I experienced at Sand@@ y B@@ ahr , who strug@@ gled for the environment for her life , and her husband Dave , my host family , who treated me like her son .
she still adapts to the commitment of Krist@@ i Kapp@@ es , who always helped me with a lot of patience and grace and helped my colleagues to get used to the complexity of American life .
then there were Andrew goo@@ ey , Kath@@ ry@@ n Mc@@ Man@@ us and Re@@ tha Hill , my ment@@ ors whose wise counsel helped me a lot in my career .
these people and the values em@@ bodied by them deep@@ ened my love for America .
while Tr@@ ump took his way to the nominated Republi@@ can presidential candidate , she offered me a stop and the counterpart to America &apos;s limited vision .
it turned out , however , that they were the exception of the rule .
on November 8 , 2016 , over 50 million Americans , mostly White , had the pres@@ idency of a man , despite - or perhaps because of his cont@@ emp@@ t against non @-@ white people .
the argument with the idea that people voted for Tr@@ ump because they shared their rac@@ ism and fan@@ ati@@ cism or because they were willing to over@@ look those things broke my heart almost .
perhaps it is unfair to call the Tr@@ ump voters as ra@@ cists .
to categ@@ ori@@ ze people , said one of my friends , is exactly what led us to this situation .
this is super@@ ficial and dis@@ respect@@ ful , and indicates an inability to understand those who act and think differently .
it shows people that their concerns and fears about the hec@@ tic changes in their communities are not taken into account .
could it be that these voters , most of whom know , have voted for Tr@@ ump because they want to regain control of a country that they have disappointed ?
in other words , they might say they are still important in this America ?
maybe . maybe .
however , one can hardly forget the words of David Rem@@ nick , who comments the cruel decision to raise a man who looks down with cont@@ emp@@ t on those who look different from him .
this &quot; Whit@@ el@@ ash &quot; ( note ) : as much as &quot; wh@@ ites against all the other eth@@ ni@@ cities &quot; ; white and whi@@ plas@@ h word play in white and whi@@ plas@@ h , as the big Van Jones mentioned , has killed exactly what America has made so great .
millions of people around the world appreciate the American ideal - regardless of whether myth or reality , it is nevertheless a powerful idea - which belief or background one may always have , America welcomes everyone .
for this country chose as its president , twice the son of a Ken@@ yan , whose history , as he says himself , nowhere else in the world would be possible .
with the choice of Donald Tr@@ um@@ ps , however , a huge portion of the White America promises this promise and says : to hell with diversity , freedom of religion and the whole concept of pl@@ ur@@ alism .
in America after 9 / 11 the white man is back at the helm , they say .
in all this I have to think of K@@ hi@@ z@@ r Khan , the father of a soldier who has fallen in Iraq , and what he said on the eve of the election .
on a demonstration for H@@ illary Clinton Mr. Khan had a word change with the crowd .
&quot; Donald Tr@@ ump , would my son , Captain Hu@@ may@@ un K@@ ahn , have a place in your America ? &quot; asked Mr. Khan .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the crowd answered with a loud &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; No ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; would Muslims have a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; no ! &quot; the crowd ro@@ ared .
&quot; did Lat@@ inos have a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; no ! &quot; they answered .
do Af@@ ro @-@ Americans have a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; no ! &quot; they cried and their voices lou@@ der .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; would anyone who is not like you have a place in your America ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he received a unanim@@ ous and lou@@ dly &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; NO &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mr. Khan concluded with the words : &quot; thank God , Mr. Tr@@ ump , this is not your America . &quot; 36 hours later he was corrected .
the land for which his son fell , sent him a message .
that &apos;s now Tr@@ um@@ ps Land , said the message .
and all the people who look like Mr. Khan could not find a place in this new America .
and this breaks my heart .

from the misery to the stars : these Latin American children cannot spoil their love for music by rub@@ b@@ ish
the &quot; Recycl@@ ed Instrument Orchestra &quot; from C@@ ate@@ ura , Paraguay , during a concert in Washington DC .

what does the Mexican music school of the Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero community have in common in the province of O@@ ax@@ aca with the children of the Paragu@@ a@@ an city of C@@ ate@@ ura ?
that the music played at both places not only changed the life of the children , but also a very close connection with ...
music that lives with the waste
Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero is located on the edge of a large land@@ fill , only 16 kilometers south of O@@ ax@@ aca &amp; # 8@@ 212 ; an old colonial town that is very popular among tourists but worlds apart from the nearby pre @-@ Colum@@ bian ruins and its world @-@ famous cuisine .
for several years now La b@@ anda de M@@ Ãº@@ sica ( music band ) has been playing in the congregation : a symph@@ ony orchestra consisting of children and adults , which has found a way to overcome the surrounding poverty with their musical instruments .
a music school with 100 pupils has become a central concern for the community of Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero in O@@ ax@@ aca .
the British newspaper The Guardian wrote about this project :
the community , located in one of Mexico &apos;s poor@@ est provinces , is known for its abuse of drugs and ban@@ ker violence .
but after a coinci@@ dental encounter with a French pilot , who started a musical project and thus offered the youth a rare gli@@ mmer of hope .
the young band members take their commitments to the music group very seriously , writes the local press Noti@@ ci@@ as O@@ ax@@ aca N@@ VI :
as soon as they come out of school , they run back home and immediately after lunch they run through the du@@ sty streets to pursue their great passion .
they always come laugh@@ ing and playing with gl@@ it@@ tering eyes and play in the hu@@ stle and bu@@ stle and play trumpet , tro@@ mb@@ one , pic@@ col@@ o , clarinet , obo@@ e , flute , french horn , tim@@ pani , bon@@ gos and the con@@ ga .
music from garbage
more than 7@@ ,000 kilometers south of Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero , the children of C@@ ate@@ ura are playing a village that is practically at the top of the largest garbage dump of As@@ unci@@ Ã³n in Paraguay &apos;s capital - on instruments made of recycled waste material :
music with re@@ processed instruments made of local solid waste materials , manufactured in a workshop for musical instruments in C@@ ate@@ ur@@ ura , where the recycl@@ ers have begun to turn parts of waste into instruments under the leadership of F@@ avi@@ o Ch@@ Ã¡@@ vez .
the instruments im@@ itate viol@@ ins , viol@@ as , cel@@ los , double bass , guitars , fl@@ utes , sax@@ oph@@ ones , trump@@ ets , tro@@ mb@@ ones and percussion , all of which were produced out of the rub@@ b@@ ish .
the repertoire includes classical music , folk music , par@@ agu@@ ay@@ an and Latin American music as well as music from the Beat@@ les , from Frank Sin@@ atra , etc .
in an article by the Los Angeles Times , F@@ avi@@ o Ch@@ Ã¡@@ vez , a local ec@@ ologist and musician of the children of C@@ ate@@ ura , rec@@ alls at the beginning :
first it was very difficult because we had no room for rehear@@ s@@ als and we had to teach at the same place where the parents worked in the garbage . the children knew no music and it was very difficult to contact the parents because many of them do not live together with their children .
this changed when F@@ avi@@ o was shown something he had never seen before : a tr@@ ash made of tr@@ ash .
today there is a whole orchestra that plays on instruments of re@@ processed material and called The Recycl@@ ed Orchestra .
a documentation called &quot; Land@@ fill Harmon@@ ic &quot; ( Harmon@@ ic garbage dump ) records the musical performance :
the world generates approximately one billion tons of waste each year .
those who live with him and from him are the poor@@ est - like the people in C@@ ate@@ ura , Paraguay .
and here they transform it into something beautiful .
Land@@ fill Harmon@@ ic follows the orchestra with its inspiring spectacle of tr@@ ash @-@ to @-@ music around the world .
the orchestra even performed his music before Pope Francis :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these East African countries demonstrate how technology and team@@ work can successfully combat illegal fishing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
photo Â© F@@ ISH @-@ i Africa - a project that comb@@ ats wild illegal fishing .
this post , written by Emma Br@@ yce , was originally published at En@@ si@@ a.com , a magazine that specifically reports on international , practical solutions for environmental problems .
the re @-@ publication happens within the framework of an agreement with Global Vo@@ ices for shared use of content .
in West Africa , at that time , it was known that this ship had already operated illegal fishing in the waters of Liber@@ ian waters before the other coast of Africa visited it .
the East African countries were thus correspon@@ dingly raised and little inclined to welcome a criminal of this species to their coasts .
Kenya , Tanzania , Mauritius , the Com@@ or@@ os , Moz@@ ambique and the Seych@@ elles were quickly mobili@@ zed against the ship . they refused to join one of their ports and refused to give him permission to fishing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; suddenly the prime minister was surrounded by countries who simply refused everything , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; re@@ members Bene@@ dict Ki@@ il@@ u , a senior employee of the Ken@@ yan fishing authority . he is part of a team that discovered and pursued the ship at that time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 2013 , the ship was then driven out of the waters of the region : it didn &apos;t manage to catch fish there .
finally , it was also forced to pay 2 million US dollars to Liberia , due to the pl@@ under@@ ing of the country &apos;s fish stocks .
the core of this initiative , which crosses criminal practices and protects resources , was F@@ ISH @-@ i Africa : a network of countries founded in 2012 by the NGO Stop Il@@ legal Fishing ( Il@@ legal F@@ ish@@ eries ) .
in addition to Somalia and Madagascar , the members of this network are the six countries that the prime minister had driven out of their waters at that time .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with this we have eight countries that are like @-@ minded and working together . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they exchange information and stand at each other where it comes to illegal fishing , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Tony Long , Head of the P@@ ew Char@@ itable Trust Project En@@ ding Il@@ legal Fishing . this project offers F@@ ISH @-@ i technical support . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
illegal fishing is un@@ regulated by definition : what is caught is hidden , so it is extremely difficult to detect . thus illegal fishing is a major cause of over@@ fishing of regions .
the deliber@@ ate dis@@ respect of existing laws by which certain habitats and species should be protected may harm the illegal fishing ecos@@ ystems that have a delicate balance .
but while actions against illegal fishing were once ham@@ pered by bureaucratic hur@@ d@@ les and also by the sn@@ ail emp@@ o , which cur@@ ated information between individual countries , the actions happen today in real time , with trac@@ eable on F@@ ISH @-@ i &apos;s digital communications platform .
for example , the individual countries can exchange lists of existing licenses , news about suspi@@ cious activities or details that were noticed or experienced during port inspection .
fish @-@ i also atten@@ tively tracks the activities of ships when they move on the open sea via satellite data .
this allows the authorities to identify ships that fish in forbidden areas . such suspi@@ cious routes can also be discovered - such as those that indicate that a ship charges its caught fish on the move to other ships .
ideally , such investigations can show whether the participating ships have a fishing license , where they were on the way and possibly also whether they have a criminal @-@ gi@@ ster .
countries that are against illegal fishing may refuse to accept such ships in their ports on the basis of this information , which means that ships cannot sell their cargo . and that they can even be forced to pay pen@@ alties , as in the case of prime minister .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; then there is considerable financial losses for the owner , which means that illegal fishing is not profitable any more . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and that is what we want to achieve , &quot; says P@@ er Erik Ber@@ gh , Chief Executive Director of N@@ F@@ DS Africa . the latter is a consulting firm engaged in the fight against illegal fishing in Africa and also supports F@@ ISH @-@ i .
a closed front
the aforementioned platform was created to recover estimated 20 million USD in lost revenue , which the eight members of the H@@ ISH @-@ i network lose each year because of the illegal fishermen entering East African waters .
East Africa has one of the most productive tuna fish@@ eries , which is why the region attracts commercial fishing from all over the world .
among them are actions such as sailing under false flag , fake lic@@ ences , indication of fantasy names , fishing of protected species and fishing in nature reserves .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the past , a ship was able to fish illeg@@ ally and a country could say &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; You may not attack my port &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
yet another country could say &apos; Come to me &apos; . &apos; and exactly this legal lo@@ op@@ hole tries to close F@@ ISH @-@ i now .
until now , the closed front is working .
since its inc@@ eption , F@@ ISH @-@ i has been involved in more than 30 studies of suspi@@ cious vessels .
it has uncovered criminal networks that had spread fake lic@@ ences in Tanzania . it discovered ships that used several frau@@ dul@@ ent identi@@ ties and it has tra@@ cked and found refugees fle@@ eing .
due to its collaboration with INTER@@ PO@@ L , the international authorities for comb@@ ating crimes , F@@ ISH @-@ i can share information on illegal fishing across large distances .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some of our investigations lead us quite far into the networks of organized crime , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Ber@@ gh . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he builds a system that will help F@@ ISH @-@ i to locate suspi@@ cious vessels more precisely .

fish @-@ i &apos;s satellite system , which is constantly evolving , helps to track the illegal vessels that love to hide .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the illegal fishermen use very sophisticated techniques to hide their activities and their position . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Dun@@ can Cop@@ eland , chief analy@@ st at Tr@@ y@@ gg M@@ at Tracking , a NGO that also deals with fisher@@ y data and offers F@@ ISH @-@ i technical support . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
some of the ships , for example , switch off their automatic identification systems , so they can no longer be ordered by satellites .
Cop@@ eland is therefore helping build a system that connects different levels of information . F@@ ISH @-@ i is supposed to help find criminals with greater precision .
a model program
but can F@@ ISH @-@ i &apos;s team of African nations actually influence the undoubtedly global problem of illegal fishing ?
John A@@ mos , President of the N@@ RO Sky@@ Truth , believes this .
recently , Sky@@ Truth has opened the Global Fishing Watch platform together with Google and the Marine Protection Organization Oc@@ e@@ ana : a platform that provides satellite data to display the position of each individual track@@ able ship worldwide .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; join together with the neighbors to get a better picture of who you are doing - that simply makes sense , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; here is a chance for countries to unite and to bundle their resources for the investigation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we should do this at a global level . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are signs that F@@ ISH @-@ i &apos;s activities do not only detect criminals but also deter them .
ships that had been f@@ ished without a license earlier and hardly expected to have consequences now know that they are being watched .
according to Ki@@ il@@ u , some of the countries involved in F@@ ISH @-@ i now have a 33 % increase in fisher@@ y sales , since fishing boats buy more licenses .
after F@@ ISH @-@ i Somalia had helped Somalia to track down Gre@@ ko 1 , the inspec@@ tors found onboard tow@@ ing nets for their use .
photo courtesy of F@@ ISH @-@ i Africa .
other countries also notice these successes . &quot; the effect is so strong that we now also copy other countries , &quot; says Ki@@ il@@ u . &quot; we are a study object . &quot; in West Africa several hundred million dollars disappear every year through illegal fishing .
in 2015 , six countries have joined forces , to the so @-@ called West Africa Task Force . they are now also fighting illegal fishing , according to the same model as F@@ ISH @-@ i@@ . &quot; Security is the aim of creating even more such initiatives and structures in other regions , &quot; says Cop@@ eland .
recently , F@@ ISH @-@ i &apos;s latest member country Somalia was able to announce its first big triumph : in October , there was Gre@@ ko 1 , a ship that was under a false flag . and not only was the ship on its way without a license and were used tow@@ ing nets that are now banned .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the taking of measures against Gre@@ ko 1 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they set a strong signal against illegal fishing , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Ber@@ gh . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for F@@ ISH @-@ i this is another success of many . and at the same time the evidence that such a special collaborative working method to protect the oceans actually works in the entire world sea .

their articles appear in the Wi@@ red Magazine , TED Education , the New York Times and the Guardian . situation in Venezuela is further escal@@ ating : demonstrations in several cities with the aim of &quot; conqu@@ ering the country &quot;
the road movements in Venezuela seem to be only the beginning of a wave of violent demonstrations .
they are considered a protest against the government &apos;s decision to stop the referendum on the removal of President Nicol@@ Ã¡s Mad@@ uro .

after the Government of Venezuela rejected the request of the opposition to a referendum , the Venezu@@ el@@ ans re@@ acted in whose eyes the negotiations on the political and economic crisis of the country ran into the void by gathering on the streets .
under the h@@ ash@@ tag # La@@ Tom@@ a@@ De@@ Venezuela ( about : the regulator of Venezuela ) you can find both pictures of these demonstrations and arguments for and against them .
the debate is also conducted in other parts of the country - including in the low@@ land area of Bar@@ inas , in the Andes @-@ regions MÃ©@@ ri@@ da and T@@ Ã¡@@ chir@@ a , in the centrally @-@ north @-@ lying federal state of Car@@ ab@@ ob@@ o and on Isla Margar@@ ita in the state of Nu@@ eva E@@ spart@@ a .
the political and economic situation of the country is wor@@ sen@@ ing continuously , which is reflected in the daily life of the Venezu@@ el@@ ans by an acute lack of food and medicines .
many representatives of the opposition saw in the dis@@ miss@@ al of the current President Nicol@@ Ã¡s Mad@@ uro the chance of a fundamental change ; in the end , however , the de@@ position of a new election was blocked by the official authorities .
Mari@@ anne D@@ Ã­@@ az , Con@@ tri@@ but@@ ors at Global Vo@@ ices in Venezuela , summar@@ ises in her latest article the context of the government decision as follows :
as part of the social , political and economic crisis , where inflation and violence are among the highest in the world ( the inflation rate is estimated at 500 % at the end of the year ) and in which a grave and widespread lack of food and medicine , the referendum was considered the only way to give the country a chance to regain its institutional structures and to close a new government alliance .
the electoral alliance Mes@@ a de la Uni@@ dad Democ@@ r@@ Ã¡@@ tica or short MU@@ D ( about : round table of the Democratic Unit ) , in which the opposition parties and political groups joined forces , urged the demonstr@@ ators to join the National Assembly on 27 October . in addition , a twelve @-@ hour strike on the following day and a march to the Mira@@ fl@@ ores Palace , the Venezu@@ el@@ an government , were scheduled to continue to pers@@ ist .
the call was commented on Twitter , among other things , as follows :
it is as far as Venezuela : tomorrow National Assembly , Friday nationwide civil war and on November 3 all go to Car@@ ac@@ as to the Mira@@ fl@@ ores Palace .
what to say ! pic@@ .@@ t@@ wit@@ ter@@ .com / 9@@ Zy@@ V@@ G@@ ld@@ N@@ ry

&quot; the re@@ conquest of Venezuela &quot;
the first demonstration in the framework of the Action Programme &quot; The re@@ conquest of Venezuela &quot; took place on Wednesday , 26 October .
the pictures of the mar@@ ches published in real time testify among other things an overwhelming participation of the people in numerous areas of the country , but also clas@@ hes with polic@@ emen as well as supporters of the government .
one of the most frequently shared images shows a demonstr@@ ator calling through the shiel@@ ds : &quot; will you kill me because I am hungry ? &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; will you kill me because I am hungry ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; cri@@ es to Venezu@@ el@@ ans . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

on Twitter , images that tell stories , as well as reports of oppression and mi@@ stre@@ at@@ ment .
especially big waves hit the news of police repression in the centrally located city of Mar@@ ac@@ ay .
there the demonstr@@ ators went back to the local cathedral to protect themselves according to their own testimony in front of the police and armed supporters of the government .
hours later they could safely leave the cathedral , but the protests continued .
in other parts of the country some demonstr@@ ators tried to stop the police forces , including this woman in the An@@ de@@ an State T@@ Ã¡@@ chir@@ a :
the women in T@@ Ã¡@@ chir@@ a don &apos;t wear skir@@ ts because you could see something that many national gar@@ di@@ sts don &apos;t have !
meanwhile , an info@@ graphic already makes a round which forms the extent of suppression per day :
thus the dictatorship has supp@@ ressed the country .
many representatives of the government had questioned the validity of the demand for a public prohibition procedure - this has now been proven in the eyes of many by the presence of countless people on the streets .

mar@@ ches are increasing frequency and intensity .
some Venezu@@ el@@ ans reported to the media that they were too hungry to participate in a strike rather than work or go shopping .

this is an adapted version of an interview by Ale@@ jo G@@ Ã³@@ me@@ z with Luis Qui@@ j@@ ano , which was published on 23 August 2016 at D@@ Ã­a a D@@ Ã­a , an Argent@@ ine news site .
the interview was translated into English and published here with kind permission .
when he was 15 years old , Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano was forced by his father to watch the atro@@ cities in La Per@@ la , a secret prison in the Argent@@ inian city of CÃ³r@@ doba .
as an adult man , Qui@@ j@@ ano now said in the context of the great La Per@@ la @-@ Ri@@ bera process in the province of CÃ³r@@ doba against his father .
in the trial , which ended on 24 August 2016 , crimes committed during the Argent@@ ine@@ an military dictatorship were examined .
Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano hasn &apos;t chosen his life .
beginning with the burden of carrying the same name as his father until the brutal military operations in the prison La Per@@ la , which he observed at the age of 15 , he suffered enough .
for 34 years he kept the family secret for himself .
in the situation at that time , I thought that was all right .
I felt like a secret agent .
as a child with 15 years , one does not notice that one is manipul@@ ated by his father .
at that time I could not realize that my father was a th@@ ief , a tor@@ turer and a mur@@ derer .
Luis Alberto did not have a choice : his father Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano was a police officer . during the Argent@@ ine@@ an military dictatorship from 1974 to 1983 , a time of state terrorism , his father was Deputy Commander of the Intelligence Department 141 in La Per@@ la prison from 1976 to 1978 .

but this is not the story of Luis Qui@@ j@@ ano , the oppres@@ sor who is accused of kidn@@ apping in 158 cases , torture , murder in almost 100 cases and kidn@@ apping of a 10 @-@ year @-@ old child .
no , this is the story of Luis Qui@@ x@@ an@@ os &apos;s son , a man who , over the years , recognized the extent of atro@@ cities he had experienced as a boy , and who testified before a Federal Constitutional Court against his own father .
his story shows what great power a parent has over his child and how this child chose for himself a path of salvation .
from the sports hall to the military base
when my father started to take me to the military base , I often went to the sports hall with us . there I had friends with a boy who made martial arts .
everyone named him &quot; K@@ ent . &quot;
I told my father about him and a few days later he showed me a black and white photo and asked me to identify my friend on it .
he said :
you are an as@@ sh@@ ole , you have been friends with one of the ERP .
keep up that they don &apos;t take you one day and I have to save you .
the abbrevi@@ ation ERP is for Ej@@ Ã©r@@ c@@ ito Revol@@ u@@ ci@@ on@@ ario del Pu@@ eb@@ lo , a revolutionary People &apos;s Army - the military arm of Argentina &apos;s Revolutionary Workers Party .
therefore he for@@ ba@@ de me to go back to the sports hall . a few days later , he took me to work on the military base .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he told me that I would be a secret agent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I was 15 years old and in the situation I thought that would be fine , because my father had educated me .
at the base of the military base I had to cr@@ ush the papers that had listened to the prisoners .
these were all kinds of documents : university degrees , hand@@ written notes , literature , certificates , propaganda materials , books , just everything .

&apos;@@ There the prisoners are tor@@ tured &apos;
my father took me four times to La Per@@ la with everything in 1976 .
at the first and last time , he let me wait at the entrance in the car .
when he took me the second time , he ordered me to go out . he led me to a bar@@ racks , in the cars , furniture , TV , fri@@ dges - simply everything possible - stood .
everything was stolen .
he gave me a small pack@@ et wrapped in a blanket and ordered me to carry it to the car . when I opened it , I saw that there was a big cl@@ ump of silver inside .
that day I went to the other end of the bar@@ racks where the stolen items were shut down and kept me with a guard .
suddenly he pointed to an open space and said :
the prisoners are tor@@ tured .
I se@@ w@@ ed in and saw a couch where people were tor@@ tured .
it looked like a field bed and metal springs .
later I found out that they attached the one end of a cable . the other end was attached to the body of the person who was tied just there .
they seldom held a man with hand@@ cu@@ ffs to the bed , poured it out with water and ch@@ ased him a charge of 220 volts to the gen@@ itals .

the sten@@ ch there was horri@@ ble ... like a dirty Win@@ del .
years later , when my father was under house arrest , the same smell came out of his room .
I realized the smell immediately and I realized that the smell of a body is in need .
I could never forget this smell .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and I asked myself : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how is it possible that a man can do so much harm to another ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&apos;@@ i knew these people were killed &apos;
when my father took me to work for the third time , he led me to the entrance of La Cu@@ ad@@ ra - the area where the prisoners were ch@@ ained and bound up with hand@@ cu@@ ffs .
he spoke with &quot; Chu@@ bi &quot; Lop@@ ez ( Jose L@@ Ã³@@ pez , a civilian who was also charged in the trial ) and took the opportunity to take a look at La Cu@@ ad@@ ra .
in the background I saw a number of matt@@ resses on which naked people were facing the face down - all were tied at hands and feet .
in the vicinity of the entrance , people quit still on the matt@@ resses .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when my father saw that I saw the prisoners , he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Why do you look so , as@@ sh@@ ole ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I replied &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Why did you get me ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I knew these people were killed .
they were cast into a pit , and were slain and buried by soldiers .
I know that because my father told me about it at home .
in addition to La Cu@@ ad@@ ra , some rooms were designated as offices .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I know that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pal@@ ito &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; killed a man there and killed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
( according to the survivors , the Zi@@ vi@@ list Jor@@ ge Rom@@ ero , who was also indic@@ ted in the La Per@@ la @-@ Ri@@ bera trial , sentenced students Ra@@ Ãº@@ l Mat@@ eo Mol@@ ina to death ) .
in the following video , Emi@@ lio Fes@@ sia , the head of the La Per@@ la Memorial Site , leads through the former torture chambers .
the path on which you came here is also the path on which the ab@@ duc@@ tions came here .
if you look at the map , you will see that they took about this path and were then tor@@ tured for the first time .
here their names were changed and they were assigned a number as part of the process of de@@ human@@ isation .
when they survived the torture , the prisoners were thrown into the cu@@ ad@@ ra until the order from above came to be postpon@@ ed .
this was the lie - the eu@@ ph@@ em@@ ism - for the shooting of the people and the dis@@ appearance of their bodies in most cases .
the &apos; boot@@ y &apos;
my father brought home all kinds of stolen things .
at that time at age I had no idea what the &quot; boot@@ y &quot; - as they called it - was .
but when I was myself in the military , I was in the gendar@@ mer@@ ie - it became clear to me that war boot@@ y is a bay@@ on@@ et or perhaps military separ@@ ati@@ sts , which you have fought against an enemy you fought .

but if one goes into a house and ste@@ als the fridge , the record player , clothes , paintings , money ... that is not a boot@@ y but v@@ and@@ alism .
this is theft .
I have always wonder@@ ed how my father , the leader of the security forces , was able to take part in this v@@ and@@ alism .
I just don &apos;t understand it .
I was also an officer in the gendar@@ mer@@ ie and I would never have liked to enter a house and steal all of it .
I don &apos;t understand how my father could do that .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; once he called me a criminal and I replied , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; And you , who ste@@ als cars on the streets ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
you are not a criminal ?
he explo@@ ded with rage , struck me and scre@@ amed :
if you go so far , then I will find you and kill you .
we don &apos;t need anyone else !
this was my father .
I don &apos;t have a single good memory of him .
as I said in the process , I showed a photo of back then , on which I wore a jacket and a rolled hem pul@@ lover from wool . both had my father from La Per@@ la .
we were not poor but he still brought clothes home .
at that time the Defence accused me of being a con@@ spir@@ ator of this crime . I replied , no problem , they can put me under the burden of what they wanted .
anyway , I was there to testify .
&apos;@@ the en@@ forced dis@@ appearance of the cor@@ p@@ se is the last ab@@ h@@ ein@@ ous act &apos;
now , where I am older , I feel re@@ mor@@ se .
I have children . if one has children , one recognizes the value of a life .
one develops further and real@@ ises that it is wrong to kill .
I even went so far to say :
well , you executed people during the dictatorship . but why should the cor@@ p@@ ses disappear ?
why are children kidn@@ apped ?
one day my father brought a girl with her mother killed .
she was like our pet , almost like a dog - only that this was a little girl .
I repeatedly asked the question : they were tor@@ tured , but why were they killed ?
they could have been put into jail .
I guess it was simply decided to kill these people . but why should their cor@@ p@@ ses disappear ?
did these people not also have families to whom they could pass their mortal remains ?
the dis@@ appearance of the cor@@ p@@ ses is the last abom@@ in@@ able act that one can do to a human being .
my father told me when the democracy was re@@ introduced , they took machines to remove the mortal remains of the prisoners .
they were grin@@ ded and dispos@@ ed of somewhere - no idea where . &quot; you will never find anything , &quot; said my father .
but of course there is always something .
&apos;@@ i have seen how you killed people ! &apos;
just to clarify : I have nothing against the military .
I was even with the gendar@@ mer@@ ie .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I just said the truth about 20 criminals , including my father . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the idea of showing my father was during a conversation when he was under house arrest .
I repro@@ ached him for all the atro@@ cities I had to experience because of him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; then he suddenly said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know . I have killed anybody . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I felt in@@ war@@ dly rep@@ elled and asked me why the whole exagger@@ ated patri@@ ot@@ ism and the &quot; Western and Christian feelings &quot; that they supposedly defended were actually good .
then I scre@@ amed :
how can you tell me something like that ?
I have seen how you killed people !
you committed terrible crimes and you forced me as a child to participate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he replied only &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Well then show me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
that &apos;s exactly what I did .
in 2010 , I ref@@ unded my first advertisement .
I had finally realized that he was a criminal .
no one can reproach me that I am pre@@ occupied . I have finally asser@@ ted against my own father .
Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano died in May 2015 under house arrest pending before the end of the trial .

the sentences in the &quot; Meg@@ ac@@ aus@@ a &quot;
the term &quot; meg@@ ac@@ aus@@ a &quot; refers to the magnitude of the judgment in Spanish .
after four years in which more than 5@@ 81 witnesses were heard , the historic La Per@@ la @-@ Ri@@ bera trial ended with crimes committed between March 1975 and December 1978 against 7@@ 16 victims finally in August .
43 oppres@@ sors were found guilty of crimes against humanity . in 28 cases , the court sentenced him to life imprisonment and in nine cases prison sentences ranging from 2 to 14 years .
eleven of the 54 def@@ end@@ ants were killed during the trial .
# La@@ Per@@ la@@ sty : murder , torture and rape by officials . # Es@@ War@@ state terrorism
all the accused were members of the military during the dictatorship , including former military personnel , former police members and civilian employees .
Pier@@ o De Mon@@ ti was kidn@@ apped along with his pregnant woman in June 1976 and brought to La Per@@ la .
he directed the following words to the silent chamber :
La Per@@ la was a death factory designed by in@@ human minds .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Court of Justice is a historic milestone for all human rights organisations who have worked for years for justice for the victims . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 1995 , Claudio O@@ ros@@ z , the lawyer of the Argent@@ inian organisation H.@@ I.@@ J.@@ O.@@ S. , which represents the children of people who were murdered or disappeared during the dictatorship , said :
the trial lasted more than three years , but the research for it took 39 years .
in March 2007 , the Argent@@ ine@@ an government sur@@ rendered the country on which La Per@@ la was located , so that a memorial site could be established there , which is now being led by human rights organisations .

a translation error makes older people in Kyoto to &quot; aw@@ ful drivers &quot;
the sign with the translation error at a center in Kyoto where you can extend your driving license .
the photo was distributed in the social media .
editing the original photos by Joshua Lev@@ ine .
in the Japanese city of Kyoto , customers of a newly opened centre in which one can have his driving licence extended , in the last month witnesses of a particularly mis@@ erable translation .
the Japanese word was written on a sign for the fact that the &quot; older motor@@ ist &quot; means , wrong@@ ly , but also with a malicious h@@ ind Th@@ ank &amp; # 8@@ 212 ; as &quot; aw@@ ful drivers . &quot;
the wrong translation was to be read from 1 to 20 September on electronic ads in the entrance area and in the building itself .
editing the original photos by Joshua Lev@@ ine , which has been widely shared in the social media .
the mistake was noticed by the translator Julian Hol@@ mes , a resident of Ky@@ ot@@ os . he was also aware of the local newspapers .
the Kyoto S@@ him@@ bu@@ n newspaper published in Kyoto wrote :
&quot; how could it come to such an English translation ?
this proves that no one has read the translation correction .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is an insul@@ t to elderly people and in an international city as Kyoto is simply unacceptable , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Hol@@ mes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the mis@@ er@@ ron@@ eous English translation was initially removed . the term &quot; terrible drivers &quot; was later replaced by the more appropriate , although gram@@ mati@@ cally not quite correct term &quot; elder drivers &quot; ( German : &quot; older drivers &quot; ) .
the police of the Kyoto pre@@ f@@ ecture ap@@ ologi@@ zed for the translation error . furthermore , she explained that the error was already contained in the text they had received from the translator and that the translation was not checked for their accuracy before publishing it .
a blo@@ gger told us about the ap@@ ologies as follows :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are really sorry that elderly people felt offen@@ ded by the inadequate correction of our part , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the police . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Japanese online news service J @-@ C@@ ast News dealt with the phenomenon of &quot; aw@@ ful &quot; older drivers in Japan and wrote :
the word &quot; aw@@ ful &quot; was den@@ ounced as an in@@ appropriate description of older mot@@ orists . according to the police , the proportion of older drivers involved in accidents , however , is quite a cause of concern .
in the Kyoto pre@@ f@@ ecture , for example , in 2005 1,@@ 9@@ 41 of total 19,@@ 460 accidents were caused by sen@@ iors . this corresponds to a share of 10 % .
ten years later , in 2014 , sen@@ iors took 1,@@ 80@@ 3 out of a total of 11,@@ 850 accidents .
this increased its share to 17.@@ 7 % .
while the number of accidents has decreased overall , the proportion of accidents caused by sen@@ iors has increased in the same period .
the above @-@ mentioned repor@@ ter gave comments to the light published on Yahoo in the article published on Yahoo , which show what prejudi@@ ces some Japanese have apparently against older drivers :
the article on Yahoo about the translation error received among other things the following comments :
- &quot; Is this not reality ? &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; How accurate is the translation actually not ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t think it &apos;s a true translation error . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are not a few such comments .
why &quot; En@@ gr@@ ish &quot; is so widespread all over Asia
translation errors are widespread in Japan and throughout Asia .
the website En@@ gr@@ ish@@ .com is a real treasure tro@@ ve for these bizarre mistakes in English .

the reasons for the wide spread of translation errors are manifold .
to translate , you need two important skills : passive language skills to understand the source text and to apply active language skills to transfer it to the target language .
the latter requires the active domination of the target language - something that is the case with native speakers . generally , the conviction that translators should be in the target language - not in the initial language - should be native speakers .
for example , a French native speaker should translate into French for example - not from French to English .
photo by Fli@@ ck@@ r user Karl Baron .
many Japanese companies do not employ English as their native language , which could translate translations into English . this may be due to lack of understanding of translation , cost reasons or the relatively small number of English native speakers who learn Japanese .
some companies , who do not have foreign employees , can still produce translations within the company . then the Japanese employee , whose English knowledge is assessed as the best , is made a translator - no matter how good or bad his language skills are .

machine translation is also widely used - often with funny results .
the pro@@ verb@@ s and pu@@ zz@@ ling sentences that arise through machine translation show that this technique can &apos;t replace a human translator for a long time . this is especially true for some languages .
some of the stran@@ gest English phrases in Japan , including the pu@@ zz@@ ling prints that often ad@@ orn t @-@ shirts or bags , are only used for styli@@ stic reasons - not to be read or even understood .
photo by Fli@@ ck@@ r user Joseph Br@@ ent .
translation errors may be acceptable or at least harmless as jewelry . but from large companies or from the government who have the means to ensure higher standards , more careful translations can be expected .
in the future , the city of Kyoto will hopefully use a rep@@ utable source for its translations .
Venezuela : protests and cens@@ orship measures on the internet and television
main page of the portal &quot; Nav@@ egar of Liber@@ ta@@ d &quot; ( Free Sur@@ fing ) of the IP@@ Y@@ S ( Institu@@ to Pr@@ ens@@ a y Soci@@ e@@ dad , Institute for Press and Society ) .
on Friday morning , April 7 , Venezu@@ el@@ an Internet users reported that they had no access to the Vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay online transmitter .
later , other users wrote that the internet appearances of V@@ PI@@ TV and El Cap@@ it@@ oli@@ o TV are no longer accessible .
other online broad@@ cast@@ ers also recorded recordings of the protests in Car@@ ac@@ as , organized by opposition groups opposing the government of Nicol@@ Ã¡s Ma@@ du@@ ros .
the protests began at the beginning of April , after the Supreme Court dis@@ b@@ anded the Parliament and transferred the Parliament &apos;s tasks to the executive and the Supreme Court itself .
Luis Carlos D@@ Ã­@@ az , journalist and author at Global Vo@@ ices , published the results of a tra@@ cer@@ ou@@ tes . he pointed out that the connection was app@@ ended and recommended the users to use VPN ( virtual private networks ) to access the Internet .
# cens@@ orship : enabled your VPN .
it seems that Internet pages of Venezu@@ el@@ an providers are again blocked .
this is from the @ Vi@@ vo@@ Play@@ Net site .
offers such as Vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay are popular among the Venezu@@ el@@ ans with Internet access , especially in times of un@@ rest .
traditional media have been hes@@ it@@ ant in reporting about protests since 2014 . at that time , the Commission for T@@ elecommunic@@ ations threatened them with fin@@ es and closures if they continue to report on the demonstrations , as the Commission saw this as a &quot; call to violence . &quot;
without cable TV and informative national TV channels , I have registered again at @ vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay@@ net .
it &apos;s amazing that this is still cheaper than buying two litres of lem@@ on@@ ade .
the local NGO VE@@ in@@ filtr@@ ated later confirmed that not only Vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay was in@@ accessible by blocking the Domain Name System ( DNS ) , but also two other online channels . this also applies to the Internet site at which the National Assembly transm@@ its its sessions .
previous research by the Institute for Press and Society ( IP@@ Y@@ S ) , a research group for digital rights in Venezuela , revealed that the local Internet providers sometimes use DNS . this is a technique by which the DNS servers answer requests for certain domains .
if a website is blocked by the DNS , the server respon@@ ds correctly or refuses the request when calling a website .
we confirm a DNS lock : @ el@@ capit@@ oli@@ ot@@ v , @ V@@ PI@@ TV and @ vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay@@ net
at V@@ PI@@ TV , a third blocked channel , the transmission was set on Thursday April 6 , when the V@@ PI@@ TV cam@@ er@@ aman El@@ vis Flor@@ es , who was transferred to Car@@ ac@@ as live , was arrested .
Flor@@ es was beaten as he was in police custody .
eight hours later he was released , and V@@ PI@@ TV went on stream .
although some channels are still accessible via YouTube , it has also been reported that the government regul@@ ates internet connections , making access to multimedia coverage of the current events in the country more difficult .
in Paraguay , many girls become slaves to receive education
T@@ ina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was a child of Cri@@ min@@ ta as a child . now she visits the house where she worked for years .
today , T@@ ina is fighting for the rights of children and collects testim@@ onies from other Cri@@ mes who have become victims of abuse and discrimination .

the following article is the shortened version of a report published by Global Vo@@ ices with the kind permission of the authors .
the article is part of a series entitled &quot; Vac@@ as que v@@ u@@ el@@ an , Esc@@ u@@ el@@ as que Ca@@ en &quot; ( &quot; Flying cows , falling schools &quot; ) , edited and re@@ published by Global Vo@@ ices of Latin America .
T@@ ina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a lived for eight years in a household where she was not allowed to eat together with the family who lived there .
shortly before her gradu@@ ation at the university she returned to the house and heard the owner of the house full of pride about her . &quot; she &apos;s like a daughter for us .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but T@@ ina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was never treated like a daughter in this house .
when she was ten years old , she began to work as Cri@@ adi@@ ta for the family . as Cri@@ mean , one calls in Paraguay the more than 4@@ 6.000 boys and girls who are forced to work to go to school .
the business is quite simple : a large family with little money hands over their minor son or their minor daughter to another , weal@@ thier family . in exchange , the child receives food , a training and a roof over the head .
however , what is not mentioned is that the children have to pay for it countless days of house@@ work , which is never paid and victims of abuse and abuse can become - and all that is within the framework of a contract that cannot be lifted .
the practice described as Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go is widespread in Paraguay because of the participation and acceptance by large sections of society and despite numerous complaints by human rights organisations .
after gradu@@ ating , Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a worked for a number of years for an organisation that fights for the rights of boys and girls .
she spoke with Cri@@ min@@ tas - especially young girls were affected by the practice of Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go - collected testim@@ onies , resear@@ ched and den@@ ounced .
she tried to call things by name , because the feeling of gratitude that is in@@ oc@@ ulated by the Cri@@ mean is generally not silent .
&quot; the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go is based on a double dec@@ eption , &quot; explains Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a .
on the one hand , the family leaving their daughter in the belief that they can complete their education , improve their position in society and &quot; make something out of themselves &quot; is handed over to another family .
on the other hand , the family that assimil@@ ates the girl and justi@@ fies the exploitation by believing that she would give someone a chance that would otherwise have no education and might even be star@@ ved .
the victims of the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go
when the girl is ab@@ used , his family will learn about it many years later .
sometimes they never experience it .
in January 2016 , the hitherto relatively unknown phenomenon , which takes place in the secret of Paragu@@ ay@@ an households , got a face .
when Carolina Mar@@ Ã­n was hospit@@ alized in Ca@@ agu@@ az@@ Ãº , her body showed traces of violent strikes . shortly thereafter she died .
she was 14 years old .
she was Cri@@ adi@@ ta in the household of the former military officer Tom@@ Ã¡s F@@ errei@@ ra and his wife Ram@@ ona Mel@@ gar@@ ej@@ o , who works as a civil servant at the registration office .
Mar@@ Ã­n lived with them in their house in V@@ aqu@@ er@@ Ã­a , a small village with only 3,000 inhabitants 250 kilometers east of the capital As@@ unci@@ Ã³n .
at the end of January 2016 F@@ errei@@ ra te@@ amed up with a stick on Mar@@ Ã­n until she suffered fatal injuries .
this should be the last punishment in the life of the young girl .
a few days later , the media reported about the incident .
they stressed that the murdered child was a Cri@@ min@@ ta .
organisations like UN@@ IC@@ EF or Call@@ es@@ cu@@ ela were responsible for the practice of Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go deeply rooted in the Paragu@@ ay@@ an society for the death of the girl .
they described the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go as &quot; a modern form of slavery . &quot;
several dozen people gathered to protest demonstrations and demanded that there would be &quot; no other Carolina &quot; in Paraguay .
the girl &apos;s name and photos have been widely publi@@ ci@@ zed in the social media .
&quot; in Paraguay more cows are registered as children , &quot; T@@ ina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a compl@@ ains .
without documents it is much easier to viol@@ ate the rights of children without imp@@ unity .
without official documents it is very difficult to control under which conditions boys and girls live .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the neighbors of the married couple and nearly 60 civil society organizations called for a quick investigation of the case . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they want Tom@@ Ã¡s F@@ errei@@ ra and Ram@@ ona Mel@@ gar@@ ej@@ o to be sentenced to 30 years in prison for the murder of the girl who was her Cri@@ min@@ ta .
if the case comes to court , the case of Carolina Mar@@ Ã­n could be landmark - if for the first time in the history of Paraguay a case of Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go comes to court .
the everyday life of a cri@@ p@@ ta
the Cri@@ min@@ tas are not only exploited as labour forces , they also live isolated from other girls at their age .
T@@ ina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was ten years old when the Far@@ bik , in which her father worked , had to sign up bank@@ rupt@@ cy and her father lost his work .
their brothers now had to work all the time and began selling sweets on the street or on the market to make money .
but they all went further to school .
only T@@ ina was sent to the capital As@@ unci@@ Ã³n as Cri@@ min@@ ta .
in her employer &apos;s house , Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a worked between four and six hours each day .
she had to divide the time in such a way that she still had time to learn .
she stood up every morning at five o &apos;clock and prepared breakfast for her employer .
Fri@@ days , for example , cleaned the fridge , cleaned up the living room , polished the furniture and dis@@ infected the floor .
when the school was over , she went home again and had time to learn .
the sooner she finished her learning , the more free she had .
but also this time was limited because she had to make dinner for her employer .
Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a says she never had to star@@ ve , but didn &apos;t get unlimited food too . &quot; I was allowed to bring me more books from the library of the landlord as food from the fridge , &quot; she rec@@ alls .
the library was well @-@ equipped and belonged to the landlord , a former military and sympath@@ iz@@ ers of the parti@@ do Liber@@ al , a liberal party that belonged to the opposition during the dictatorship of Al@@ fre@@ do Stro@@ ess@@ ner , who was in power from 1954 to 1989 .
on some evenings the host of Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a forced him to stand next to him and to read editorial from opposition newspapers such as &quot; Sen@@ der@@ o &quot; or &quot; El Pu@@ eb@@ lo . &quot;
he tried to convince them to give no faith to the reports of the official media about the dict@@ ator &apos;s regime .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he considered it intelligent , but did not enter@@ tain it with her . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the landlord had found someone who listened to while he talked about politics , &quot; she says .
&quot; they didn &apos;t often allow me to visit my family because they felt that I would &quot; learn &quot; bad habits there again . &quot; they meant that Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a , who belongs to the indigenous group of Guar@@ an@@ Ã­ , would return home to their mother tongue Guar@@ an@@ Ã­ .
their Lord feared that they would lose the education that they had enabled her to lose .
but she was fully aware that she had paid for everything she got from them with her hard work .
even at school , Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was discrimin@@ ated against . &quot; one thing about which almost never was spoken is mo@@ b@@ bing and har@@ ass@@ ment that cri@@ es are exposed when they go to school .
because the other children have parents , they immediately recognize that someone who has no parents is a cri@@ p@@ ta .
I couldn &apos;t invite anybody to go home . I didn &apos;t have a circle of friends in the school or in the neighborhood .
in my youth , in the time when friend@@ ships arise , I felt particularly clear that I belonged to no group .
the isolation was the worst of all , &quot; explains Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a .
society endor@@ ses Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go
in January 2015 , a woman published the following text in a Facebook group where you can share job advertisements for cleaning staff and pa@@ edi@@ at@@ ric girls in Paraguay .
the group &apos;s administrator is Pep@@ a Kos@@ ti@@ an@@ ov@@ sky , a city coun@@ cill@@ or in the As@@ unci@@ Ã³n district .
hello ! I &apos;m looking for a small companion for my little daughter who plays with her in the morning and in the afternoon .
to learn .
please contact you .
starting on Monday , if possible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the ad got five &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Li@@ kes &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and many comments . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a woman from the place Ã@@ em@@ by wrote that she had a five @-@ year @-@ old girl and gave her phone number .
another woman , who also came out of Ã@@ em@@ by , offered her 15 @-@ year @-@ old ni@@ ece . &quot; she likes small children and is very pretty , &quot; she wrote .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the third comment was written by &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a girl from the interior that wants to work . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
then the author ech@@ o@@ ed once again :
dear friends , I found one . I see if it works with her .
thank you very much , I &apos;m writing again if something is .
the business was complete .
in the pro@@ lo@@ gue to the report of Cri@@ min@@ tas , Â¿ ha@@ sta cu@@ bin@@ do ?
( Cri@@ mean , how long ? ) , a collection of testim@@ onies of former Cri@@ mean tas , writes Or@@ ti@@ z :
in the course of our history we have managed to aboli@@ sh systems such as slavery , Cu@@ Ã±@@ ad@@ az@@ go ( a practice from the early history of Paraguay , where the Spanish conqu@@ er@@ ors , the Con@@ qui@@ stad@@ ores , the women of Guar@@ an@@ Ã­ ) and the indigenous population had to pay tribute to them , and the indigenous population went into a system of slavery , where they become light victims of abuse and exploitation .
the social ine@@ quality in Paraguay and the show of power are the key to understanding the phenomenon known as Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go .
bill dict@@ ates Egyptian users social media to register with the government
image of Pix@@ ab@@ ay , modified by Global Vo@@ ices .
posted in Public Domain CC@@ 0 .
sixty Egyptian MPs have recently agreed to &quot; draft legislation on the use and benefit of social networks . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when it is adopted by Parliament , users must register social media in Egypt at a government authority to use social media including Facebook and Twitter . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the basis of the law , a place would be established that is in charge of granting citizens a permit to use social media . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
within six months with the adoption of the law , users must register on the site of the site with their correct names and ID numbers in order to be able to use social networks .
if it fails to do so , it could result in a penalty of up to six months of imprisonment or a loss of fin@@ es .
the bill , which consists of six paragra@@ phs and cur@@ ses in local media including You@@ m@@ 7 and Egypt Independent , defines social media as &quot; any application that runs through the Internet and is used to communicate with others by voice , video reports and text . &quot;
it is not clear how the law is en@@ forced when it is accepted as the draft does not indicate how Egyptian authorities can impose the registration . unclear is also how they should account those who do not register in the face of the fact that the Egyptian government is currently not able to guarantee regulation on the level of social media companies .
Ri@@ y@@ ad Ab@@ dul Satt@@ ar , MP and promot@@ er of the bill , told the magazine Al @-@ Monitor , registered users received a username and password from the Ministry of Communications to get through the fire@@ wall that blocks Facebook . &quot;
this could mean that Egypt plans to build a fire@@ wall at national level around Facebook . on the basis of which it would be necessary for Egyptians to submit information about their identity to access the network .
but it has not been known until now that such plans exist .
experts on site are scep@@ tical regarding the technical feasibility of the proposal .
Ram@@ y Ra@@ o@@ of , Senior Research Techn@@ ologist ( in German &quot; senior research techn@@ ologist &quot; ) of the Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights ( E@@ IP@@ R , in German &quot; Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights &quot; ) , said Global Vo@@ ices :
I strongly doubt the technical capacities and understanding of any authority in Egypt concerning things related to technology .
in my opinion , they imagine that as they viol@@ ently control physical public and private spaces it could also be done online .
if I take them seriously , that means they will set up a powerful surveillance system to filter citizens who seek permission or not . and that means a crazy system to monitor people &apos;s activities and also to bring them to a court process .
this is technically not realistic - but in Egypt everything is possible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in order to be adopted as a law , the draft must first be discussed by the Parliament and the constitutional committees before it enters the plenary debate . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
whether its acceptance and enforcement is successful or not , the draft &quot; is in line with a pro @-@ military way of thinking in the parliament , in whose sense the control is maxim@@ ised and must be ensured that no diver@@ ging nar@@ ration is present on the surface , &quot; says Ra@@ o@@ of .
last year , the MP Tam@@ er El @-@ Sha@@ haw@@ y proposed a legal action against cy@@ ber crime in which a life @-@ long prison sentence was intended for those who are found guilty of threatening &quot; public order , &quot; and &quot; to protest . &quot;
how a Kur@@ dish nature conserv@@ ation@@ ist protects the Persian le@@ op@@ ard from war @-@ drawn Iraq

this article by To@@ dd Reu@@ bold was published in the original at En@@ si@@ a.com , a magazine that deals with international environmental protection solutions .
high up in the mountains of Kur@@ dist@@ an in the north east of Iraq , the Ti@@ ersch@@ Ã¼tz@@ erin H@@ ana Ah@@ med R@@ aza and her team of scientists from the Non @-@ Govern@@ mental Organization Nature Iraq are working to protect the gh@@ ost@@ ly Persian le@@ op@@ ard .
a sub@@ species of the larger family of le@@ op@@ ards , who w@@ anders through Africa and Asia , belongs to the Persian le@@ op@@ ards ( Pan@@ ther@@ a Par@@ dus sax@@ ic@@ ol@@ or ) . all in all , there are between 800 and 1,000 animals , so the International Union for Conservation of Nature . they are endangered because of po@@ aching , the loss and frag@@ mentation of their habitat and since they always find less boot@@ y .
why is this particular type of le@@ op@@ ard so important ?
as R@@ aza indicates in the video , &quot; the Persian le@@ op@@ ard is the only survi@@ ving pre@@ dat@@ or in the Kur@@ dish ecosystem , &quot; and the health and prosperity of the ecosystem also depends on a large pre@@ dat@@ or .
the chance to see a Persian le@@ op@@ ard indeed in the free wilderness is low and goes against zero . as the team in the video therefore determines that they have a shot of a large cat in the camera , R@@ aza escap@@ es in pure joy .
as a trained bi@@ ologist , R@@ aza loves to show a different side of her country , which consists not only of war and conflict .
she has been involved in field studies on wildlife and educational programs in Nature Iraq for six years .
since 2013 , it has also been a member of the IU@@ CN / SS@@ C Cat Speci@@ alist Group and advoc@@ ates the establishment of protection zones for wildlife in the Kur@@ dist@@ an region .

at the beginning of March 2017 , K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o , the newspaper responsible for nor@@ theastern Japan , documented the progress made in the last six years to rebuild the lives of those affected by the &quot; triple catastrophe &quot; of March 2011 . a massive earthquake , a ts@@ un@@ ami and an atomic crash in Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma caused the catastrophe .
the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper has its headquarters in Sen@@ dai , located in the pre@@ f@@ ecture of Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i . Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i pre@@ f@@ ecture was one of the pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures in Japan &apos;s Nor@@ theast , which had to experience both the earthquake and the resulting ts@@ un@@ ami .
hundreds of thousands of people from Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and the neighbouring villages Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma and I@@ w@@ ate were forced to ev@@ acu@@ ate , because the ts@@ un@@ ami had let entire coastal cities disappear from the map .
for this reason , Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma pre@@ f@@ ecture has experienced an atomic crash , already for this reason 160 000 inhabitants had to leave their homes .
the special report of the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o shows from a local point of view which progress has been achieved six years after , to rebuild the life of local residents .
the detailed report of the paper includes both the Japanese re@@ building authority and the survey results of the affected persons themselves .
the housing situation in Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma , Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate
the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper reported that by December 2015 , a total of 77 per cent of the planned replacement houses were completed in the pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma , Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate .
Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i was able to see the biggest success among the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures , and 80 per cent of the planned replacement houses were completed .
I@@ w@@ ate has completed 75 per cent of such houses , whereas Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma forms the final light with 70 percent .
nevertheless , one still tries to res@@ ett@@ le also six years after the catastrophe , ev@@ acu@@ ated of shel@@ tered shel@@ ters ( for the fact that it was the only way to res@@ ett@@ le Kaz@@ et@@ su ju@@ ut@@ ak@@ u ) in final spare @-@ houses .
after the triple catastrophe , nearly 80 000 people saw themselves forced to live in shel@@ ters .
in December 2016 , 36@@ 0,000 people from Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i , Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma and I@@ w@@ ate lived in such dwell@@ ings .
almost 40 percent of the ev@@ ac@@ uation from Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma in 2011 still lives in emergency shel@@ ters , whereas Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i was more successful here . more than 75 percent of the ev@@ acu@@ ees who were living after the disaster in Beh@@ el &apos;s shel@@ ters were res@@ ett@@ led in final houses .
for I@@ w@@ ate the number here is 34 percent .
the state of work and everyday life in the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures concerned
as the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o @-@ Zeitung was able to determine , 10@@ 74 of 1100 schools , who were affected by mis@@ fortune , opened its doors until December 2016 , accounting for almost 98 percent of the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures schools .
six years later , it is clear that industrial reconstruction in the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures is far more difficult .
while nearly 100 per cent of the fishing ports in I@@ w@@ ate and Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i are now in operation , only 30 percent of the fishing ports have resum@@ ed their operation in Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma .
the ts@@ un@@ ami and the nuclear accident suffered extensively in the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures of agr@@ arian land .
Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i was able to restore 93 percent of its agricultural land , with only 66 percent of farm@@ land in I@@ w@@ ate and less than 50 percent of destroyed farm@@ land in Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma .
it is unlikely that this is only a consequence of the nuclear accident , because only 6@@ 90 ac@@ res of 5@@ 400 hectares of destroyed ar@@ able land of Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma are located in the &quot; nuclear barrier zone . &quot;
in two of the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures the tourism has recovered largely , but also here Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma lag@@ ged far behind .
the tourist numbers in Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate are up to 90 percent on the same level as before the disaster . Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma , on the other hand , can only exhibit 75 percent .
however , the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper also reports that since the catastrophe almost half of the coastal dw@@ ellers find it difficult to earn their living .
is the native population prepared for the next major earthquake ?
in order to be able to determine the overall picture , the newspaper conducted numerous surveys among the local population and the ev@@ ac@@ uation . she questioned her about the state of reconstruction and also how her emp@@ athy has changed vis @-@ Ã  @-@ vis the ts@@ un@@ ami risk .
in her introduction , the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper explains :
the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o conducted a survey to learn more about the ts@@ un@@ ami awareness among the local population .
the survey carried out that 8@@ 3.1 percent of local residents took measures to be prepared for future earthqu@@ akes and ts@@ un@@ am@@ is .
however , 5@@ 5.@@ 9 per cent of respon@@ dents found that still not enough was done in disaster prevention .
how it stands for those who had to be ev@@ acu@@ ated from the Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma pre@@ f@@ ecture
in her issue to commemor@@ ate the anniversary of the earthquake , the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper emphas@@ ised her attention to the situation of the ev@@ ac@@ uation from Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma .
Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma did not only have to experience the massive earthquake and the devastating ts@@ un@@ ami , no , the Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma pre@@ f@@ ecture was also witness to the worst , disaster @-@ induced nuclear accident that Japan ever had to experience .
about 16@@ ,000 people from Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma were displaced in areas outside the pre@@ f@@ ecture of Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma .
at the beginning of 2016 , a little more than 23@@ ,000 people were res@@ ett@@ led back to Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma , in permanent spare @-@ houses .
after the state of 2017 , 40 000 inhabitants of Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma still live outside their home pre@@ f@@ ecture .
in the disaster areas , most of the ev@@ acu@@ ees who still live in shel@@ ters are older than 50 years old . it is well known that the efforts are to compete for the reconstruction of Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i , I@@ w@@ ate and Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma with massive construction projects . these are construction projects that are part of the Olympic Games that will take place in Tokyo in 2020 .
the world is small : our pod@@ cast &quot; In@@ to the Deep &quot;
when people come across from other countries speaking a different language , the differences seem to be greater than the simil@@ arities .
after a while , however , one often recognizes that one more links than it seems at first sight .
these global connections are important as they challenge our prejudi@@ ces , expand our perspectives and remind us that the world is ultimately very small .
in this episode of In@@ to the Deep , the Global Vo@@ ices Pod@@ cast , we look closely at these global connections . in our In@@ to the Deep Pod@@ cast we treat issues that get less attention in the coverage than they deserve .
we speak with five Global Vo@@ ices members who are remember@@ ing a moment in which they have felt very strongly connected with someone over language and country borders .
Ver@@ oni@@ ki Kri@@ kon@@ i talks about the simil@@ arities of Greek and Turkish ; Tor@@ i E@@ gher@@ man explains how the love of music over@@ came the lack of common language skills during a trip in rural China ; Adri@@ ana M@@ aci@@ as talks about the time it worked with people from all over the world ; and Jo@@ ey Ay@@ ou@@ b looks back on his experiences he collected in a small village in Madagascar .

Brasili@@ an activ@@ ist in an artificial coma after being beaten by the police in nationwide demonstrations
left : the attack against Mat@@ eus F@@ errei@@ ra da Silva . photo : Lu@@ iz da Lu@@ z . published with permission .
right : Mat@@ eus F@@ errei@@ ra da Silva on a widespread photo .
a Brazilian student at the age of 33 was delivered to the intensive care unit this week : last Friday , a police officer met him during a demonstration in Go@@ i@@ Ã¢@@ nia with a strike against the head . millions of demonstr@@ ators took part in a protest march against austerity .
Mat@@ eus F@@ errei@@ ra da Silva , who studies social sciences at the Federal University of Go@@ i@@ Ã¡s , has suffered a skull @-@ brain trauma and several frac@@ tures .
doctors operated this Saturday and now transferred him to an artificial coma .
its condition is regarded as critical .
the local photo journalist Lu@@ iz da Lu@@ z made photos of the attack on Mat@@ eus , which spread quickly in Brazil within a few days .
on the pictures is also the face of the police officer , who attacked with a strike . the man was identified as August@@ o S@@ amp@@ ai@@ o .
after the incident , the military police announced in the Brazilian state of Go@@ i@@ Ã¡s that S@@ amp@@ ai@@ o was suspended from active ministry until the investigation of the incident .
the pictures show the police officers , as he strikes in Go@@ i@@ Ã¢@@ nia with his head@@ stock on the face of the student Mat@@ eus F@@ errei@@ ra ( photos : Lu@@ iz da Lu@@ z ) .
if a police officer was beaten by a demonstr@@ ator and landed on the intensive care unit , his face would be on television for six months and the entire oppression would be justified .
the Facebook page &quot; Des@@ neur@@ ali@@ z@@ ador , &quot; a press channel of media activists from Go@@ i@@ Ã¢@@ nia , shared the video recorded by Lu@@ iz da Lu@@ z on the web in which you can see how Mat@@ eus is attacked by the police officer and several param@@ e@@ dic@@ s shortly thereafter hur@@ ry to him .
another video with the same scenes but filmed from a different perspective is also immersed in social networks .
in the clip shown below you can see the attack on Mat@@ eus from the 50@@ th second .
for the family of Mat@@ eus , who lives in another state , Internet users have now donated 10,000 Brazilian Re@@ ais ( about 2,@@ 700 euros ) to cover part of the cost of medical treatment and to allow his family to stay in Go@@ i@@ Ã¢@@ nia while he is in hospital .
&quot; be brave , Mat@@ eus .

on Facebook , Professor Pablo Ort@@ ell@@ ado calls for further violence against activists in Go@@ i@@ Ã¡s :
Go@@ i@@ Ã¡s experiences a wave of political violence : here the activ@@ ist Gu@@ il@@ her@@ me Irish was murdered by his father , because he supported the Occup@@ y movement in secondary schools . here , the military police of a W@@ hat@@ s@@ App group participated , only to crimin@@ alize teachers , and here we have attacked the very sad case of Mat@@ eus F@@ errei@@ ra da Silva , who was attacked by a polic@@ eman who struck him with a stroke .
police Hand@@ les
Go@@ i@@ Ã¡s was not the only state in Brazil where there was brutal police action against demonstr@@ ators last Friday .
at protests in the centre of Rio de Jan@@ eiro , police officers set up a stage for speakers , rubber bul@@ lets and tear gas .
the deputy , Fla@@ vio Ser@@ af@@ ini , the Social and Peace Party ( P@@ SO@@ L ) , asked the police to refra@@ in from violence against demonstr@@ ators .
this includes a report in Fol@@ ha de S. Paulo , one of the oldest newspapers in the country .
once again , the Brazilian media have covered street protests by focusing on another unexpected protagon@@ ist : a window pane .
the Fol@@ ha de S. Paulo and Est@@ ado de S. Paulo pur@@ pos@@ efully reported on a broken glass window in order to illustrate its title pages illustr@@ atively with a photo .
on the other hand , O Glob@@ o preferred a cover story with a bus set on fire .
there is no plau@@ sible journ@@ alistic reason to report more about a broken window screen than about the protests of thousands of people serving the defense of a special thing .
you also have to acknowledge this if you are strictly opposed to any kind of damage .
here , too , the term &quot; v@@ and@@ alism &quot; gets an absurd , dispro@@ portion@@ ate importance , and the typical acts of violence by the military police are covered by head@@ lines with the title &quot; prot@@ esters on confrontation with the police . &quot;
the For@@ un@@ du@@ str@@ alization of For@@ gotten Vill@@ ages in Cuba
with the introduction of the law of Ã@@ l@@ varo Re@@ yn@@ oso , almost hundreds of sugar cane factories in the whole of Cuba concluded the doors ( photo : Juli@@ o B@@ ati@@ sta )
the popular congregation of Greg@@ orio Ar@@ le@@ Ã© Ma@@ Ã±@@ al@@ ich , located in the Western Cu@@ ban province of May@@ ab@@ e@@ que , is generally known as el Central - on a Spanish Su@@ gar Mill , not@@ withstanding that there is no appreci@@ able sugar crop on site .
it was two years ago when the activities in the sugar cane factories were paraly@@ zed .
after the rest , the sugar cane industry remained silent in the region , and the factory gradually lost its plants until only the framework of steel and concrete remained .
about 27@@ 2 workers had to inv@@ ent themselves .
some changed the work .
others res@@ ig@@ ned and comm@@ uting daily to the factories that are still grinding .
N@@ ene , a soldier veter@@ an , who stands up every day at 4 : 00 am , the crisis in the sugar cane industry does not depri@@ ve his sleep .
it heard that there are sugar cane factories in the east of the region , which are in operation after a long period of in@@ active time , because they were preserved .
that was something he didn &apos;t expect .
N@@ ene is sure to have heard that in Ma@@ Ã±@@ al@@ ich the sugar cane factory would be preserved , but the promise was not kept .
the sugar cane industry has already resist@@ ed the pl@@ agues , the fall of socialism , the low market prices , in@@ efficiency , bad administrative decisions and climate change .
in 2016 , production amounted to 1.6 million tonnes of sugar , less than the quantity produced in 1910 .
the news would have been a motive for concern for the country several decades ago , but the bad harv@@ ests are no longer a news anymore .
why was the Cu@@ ban sugar cane industry switched off ?
the old railway platform of the community saw even better times .
( photo : Juli@@ o B@@ ati@@ sta )
the reduction in the sugar cane industry was an economic necessity : the 155 sugar cane factories were technically out@@ dated , and hardly competitive they became unbe@@ ar@@ able for the country .
the initial idea was to concentrate production on the most efficient factories , the annual production target was 4 million tonnes .
they only left the factories that could produce sugar for a maximum of 4 Cent@@ av@@ os ( 0.@@ 03 Euro ) .
the solution for unemployment ?
the motives that led to such measures were the low productivity of sugar cane plant@@ ations and the sugar crisis in the world market .
nevertheless the sugar price rose again about a decade ago .
from 2017 to 20@@ 25 , the price of un@@ refined sugar has to remain between 15 and 16 Cent@@ av@@ os per pound , according to the report published in 2016 by the OECD and FA@@ O , the United Nations Agricultural and Food Organisation .
if current production would reach the level of 2001 ( 3.6 million tonnes ) , the raw sugar exports would generate around 85 million dollars for the country .
not everything went well
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today &apos;s day will certainly go into history , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these were the first words of Cu@@ ban President F@@ ide@@ l Castro , during his speech on 21 October 2002 at the sugar factory in Lav@@ ender . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
from then on the process of restructuring in the sugar industry began .
in the following years , the de@@ commissioning of a total of 98 sugar cane factories , more than 65 million people received their full sal@@ aries for further education .
the same happened in the sugar cane factory Greg@@ orio Ar@@ l@@ Ã©e Ma@@ Ã±@@ al@@ ich on May 14 , 2004 .
Luis Alberto PÃ©@@ rez was working in the factory since 1967 .
when N@@ ene , as he is known as a soldier , talks about the closing of the factory , the word he repe@@ ats most frequently is &quot; fraud . &quot;
almost all those questioned are in the same opinion : not one of them was informed that the factory would be shut down .
in order for the place to be preserved , they constituted a full @-@ time working group .
before the first anniversary , the first letters began to come .
it was officially recorded documents that were only distinguished with regard to the parts that would be removed , the add@@ res@@ see and the date .
all were signed by U@@ li@@ ses Ros@@ ales del Toro , only the Minister could appro@@ ve any withdrawal .
from then on the responsibility was taken and the letters came more and more frequently .
Juan Carlos Ri@@ ver@@ o was responsible for the shut @-@ down factory for two years and he was one who received the letters . &quot; the country had no money for the sugar cane factories operating in operation , &quot; he affir@@ ms .
Ed@@ dy Re@@ yes , 64 years , awaits the retirement in another plant , the Boris Luis Santa Col@@ oma .
he was against his will in the shut@@ down of the factory , in whose construction he helped .
with every part he removed , he dis@@ assembled one of his 31 years of work .
the most developed industrial area of Cuba and most important work@@ places was extingu@@ ished .
in many cases , there were no alternatives for the work places and services generated by the plants in the communities in which they were located .
we will never know if during the M@@ amm@@ oth speech of October 21 , 2002 , the then president looked into the eyes of the people present when he guaranteed that for the areas whose factories were no longer in operation for five years , everything would go well .

sugar cane has been extracted only highly by milling since 2004 .

after two years the popular congregation Greg@@ orio Ar@@ le@@ Ã© Ma@@ Ã±@@ al@@ ich learned that many things change , but not always for the better when a factory is closed .
when the sugar cane factory closed , or rather , when they began to interc@@ ede , they stopped collecting the road , and this dis@@ advant@@ aged other farms .
without work in the region , and with advanced age , N@@ ene and Ed@@ dy had to visit other factories .
they became spare parts .
without a future perspective many young people left the region .
in the area a food factory was created , whose production serves not even for the supply of the municipality .
the ruins of the factory behind the new plant continue to be imposing .
at the end of 2016 N@@ ene returned to the factory Boris Luis Santa Col@@ oma , the ruins of the place where he began to work .
nin@@ ety @-@ nine harv@@ ests bring the old soldier a pension of two thousand p@@ eso per month to spend the years in retirement in Ma@@ Ã±@@ al@@ ich .
Mr. N@@ ene , a man of black skin colour , small , with few teeth and clear voice , is not a neighbor , yet he does not forgive the lies he told him .
they have tor@@ ment him for ten years .
N@@ ene is reti@@ ring at 65 years of age , not because it lacks power , but because it is bitter .

first Nations young people use hip hop to express themselves and get their own culture
recording a song from &quot; Home to Me &quot; - Gr@@ assy Nar@@ rows First Nation .
photo used with permission of N &apos;@@ we J@@ in@@ an .
young people of the First Nations communities across Canada deal with topics that are important to them . they do that by means of hip @-@ hop thanks to a series of hiking workshops .
as part of the N &apos;@@ we J@@ in@@ an Tour , workshop leaders have been bringing mobile recording studios directly to schools and youth centres since 2014 to teach youth groups song writing , recording , audio and video production and live performances .
the original workshops were conducted by David Ho@@ dges , who lives in Montreal and worked in North Que@@ bec with ten Cre@@ e communities and then worked with the Cre@@ e Hip @-@ Hop @-@ Group The Nor@@ th@@ Stars .
the workshop goes on with the fact that the young participants in talks like &quot; cultural identity , language , debate , love , self @-@ acceptance &quot; or whatever comes to mind .
these questions are inspiration for songs and videos in which young people are the main actors .
because the workshops were so popular , the team also collabor@@ ated with other first Nations communities in the Canadian province of British Columbia and was invited to organize similar workshops with the branch of the Win@@ ne@@ b@@ ago in the U.S. state of Neb@@ ras@@ ka .
this video of the school &apos; Na Ak@@ sa Gy@@ il@@ ak &apos; Yo@@ o in the area of the master of the Kit@@ tot@@ kal@@ um First Nation in British Columbia , for example , tells the story of Highway 16 , also called &quot; Highway of tears , &quot; a street section in West@@ kan@@ ada , where almost two dozen mostly indigenous young women disappeared or were murdered .
the cases were largely un@@ explained .
the next video of the Nem@@ as@@ ka Cre@@ e First Nation uses the motif of a video game to convey how important the preservation of traditional customs and customs is , despite the influence of global@@ isation .
many of the songs appeared in indigenous languages , although the young@@ sters do not always dominate the languages of the First Nations .
in the following song that the Wh@@ ap@@ mag@@ oo@@ th@@ i Cre@@ e First Nation has recorded , the chor@@ us is sung on Cre@@ e .
the young people involved received some help from Gary J@@ ol@@ ly from the Nor@@ th@@ stars Hip @-@ Hop group , who gave them a verse in the Eastern James Bay Cre@@ e dial@@ ect .
on the Facebook page of N &apos;@@ we J@@ in@@ an there is a verse to the verse , as well as a translation into English translated into German :
sometimes I feel like no one ever is interested in me
but I try to continue my days on Earth
this is the day you will take our cry
because as a youth we have lost our way in life
but I believe that we will rise one day
I don &apos;t want to see how they live a bad life
so they can grow and move forward as well as our youth
so they can do what they intended for the Creator
in the comment section , the reader and author of the Cre@@ e language Kevin Bro@@ us@@ se@@ au also makes a contribution and adds the verse to the sy@@ ll@@ able inscription ( which is published on his blog and published here with permission ) :
in Japan plastic meals are not only shown in the restaurant
plastic meals ( for the most part ) outside of a typical restaurant in Japan .

in Japan it is possible to see plastic meals in front of almost every restaurant .
to show potential customers what exactly is on the menu , they are displayed near the entrance sh@@ ok@@ u@@ hin san@@ pur@@ u ( some of the so @-@ called &quot; plastic models of the dishes &quot; ) of any food served in this restaurant .
customers can see these plastic dishes and decide if they enter the restaurant or go on .
there is a whole industry dedicated to the production of these plastic dishes .
in the Tokyo district of Kapp@@ ab@@ ash@@ i there are a large number of small companies that produce those plastic dishes that the German film@@ maker W@@ im Wen@@ ders documented in his film Tokyo @-@ G@@ a more than 20 years ago .
for most Japanese , these plastic dishes are so common that they don &apos;t even notice them . however , a new trend today turns them into show@@ y cell phone accessories and other gad@@ gets .
the blo@@ gger it@@ ini@@ i series of social media links and photos published by Na@@ ver Mat@@ ome published this unusual twist with sh@@ ok@@ u@@ hin san@@ pur@@ u .
now in special sale : new plastic rib@@ bons decorated with plastic rib@@ bons , as shown in the K@@ ich@@ i@@ jo@@ ji Tok@@ y@@ u department store .
many of these artificial foods have been converted to kit@@ sch@@ y collection objects , as in this case , fridge mag@@ nets :
here are some Sho@@ ku@@ hin refrigerator mag@@ nets for a new exhibition at the Tokyo @-@ Station .
the new boom in food production is becoming increasingly more complex .
in this case an Imperial @-@ don ( a popular rice bowl with seafood ) was transformed into a mobile stand .
for this tri@@ angular dish ( lo@@ l ) we have found a good use as a phone stand .
we also made this part of the exhibition in Tokyo Station .
and here is an apple that holds your cell phone :
designed to look like an apple , with a not@@ ch for the mobile phone , this is already a great design .
and this is just the beginning of an increasing flight into the Com@@ intern .
some mobile phone boo@@ ths and mobile phones allow you to create your own artwork . in this case , i@@ kur@@ a or laugh@@ s@@ che@@ ating is used , a popular t@@ opping that is served with white rice .
on Twitter , some users had doubts :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is there anyone who would say : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; w@@ ow , cool , now I can decorate my mobile phone with s@@ miles ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I think I will be the only one .
this interest in plastic dishes can also take on a less appeti@@ zing form in order to surprise colleagues or family members unpleasant .
our latest mobile stand has the form of melting ice .
in addition , there are also rice balls ( O@@ ni@@ gir@@ i ) , earrings and hand@@ y@@ bands of dried salmon .
other bizarre plastic dishes can be seen at : it@@ ini@@ i &apos;s Na@@ ver Mat@@ ome blog post . or follow on Twitter the h@@ ash@@ tag # for the little ones to be ma@@ stered .
if you would like to learn more about the origin of this trend , this video gives you an insight into the district of Kapp@@ ab@@ ash@@ i , which is dedicated to supplying the restaurant industry .
the following video shows how the Japanese plastic meals are actually made .
a Mexican project tells the stories of the survivors of the struggle against organised crime
&quot; for the victims of the fight against drug traffi@@ ckers . &quot;

in reports of domestic and foreign media about the in@@ famous &quot; fight against drug traffi@@ cking &quot; in Mexico , the mis@@ chief and the killed regularly appear only in statistics . however , they do not reflect the extent of the human tragedy that this struggle ent@@ ails .
the report on drug bos@@ ses such as El Ch@@ apo Gu@@ z@@ m@@ Ã¡n , the head of the Sin@@ alo@@ a cart@@ el , pushed the stories of the victims of the conflict perfectly into the background .
on the day after a violent incident , hardly anyone looks at the ber@@ eav@@ ed or the communities who have learned to live with the pain .
behind every body , behind every bone discovered in the hundreds of secret graves , the stories of countless parents , sons and daughters , friends and partners whose wounds may never heal .
that is why the Mexican news portal Animal Pol@@ Ã­@@ tico has launched the digital project &quot; A@@ pr@@ ender a Vi@@ vir C@@ on El Nar@@ co &quot; ( German : &quot; live with drug traffi@@ cking &quot; ) , which will give these victims a voice and tell stories of people who are in the fight between law enforcement and cart@@ els .
animal Pol@@ Ã­@@ tico describes the project like this :
organised crime can not only be feared for our lives .
the effects are far more profound .
for example , when businesses close because they are threatened by drug dealers and entire communities have to drive many kilometers to buy something as simple as milk .
the pain of the victims
a video with the title &quot; Vi@@ das que Cam@@ bian p@@ or el mi@@ edo &quot; ( German : &quot; how afraid life changes &quot; ) tells exactly these stories .
a main character is Guadal@@ upe , a father who seeks secret graves after his son every weekend .
or Emma Vel@@ eta Ro@@ dr@@ Ã­@@ gu@@ ez , who lost her father , her husband and two of her ne@@ ph@@ ews on just one day .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; priests : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; like every Sunday , we are preparing ourselves again today for the task that we have set before us and seek for tom@@ bs , according to the people we have loved . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Guadal@@ upe Con@@ tr@@ eras : &quot; my son is Antonio Ivan Con@@ tr@@ eras Mat@@ a .
he was 28 when he disappeared .
he has three children .
he worked in an electric store in El Nar@@ an@@ jo .
he left the house on October 13 .
on October 15th , he should be back again , but he never came back . &quot; Emma Vel@@ eta : &quot; it is very difficult for me , because I am now alone with three children who need training .
there is also my mother , who is here with me too .
at the moment she has no income .
you are the insurance of my father , but she doesn &apos;t pay them out because they require a death certificate .
where should we get them ? &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the editors of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A@@ pr@@ ender a vivi@@ r con el Nar@@ co &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explain why the project is so important : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we don &apos;t just have to show the faces of those who are afraid . we must show the international community the conflicts , the frag@@ ility and the leadership of the state .
the project is based on stories of readers and reports by journalists in high @-@ risk areas .
here are some excer@@ pts from the stories .
K@@ Y@@ H@@ B , a reader of Animal Pol@@ Ã­@@ tico , wrote this post from Tax@@ co , in the state of Gu@@ err@@ ero in central Mexico .
your contribution reminds us that violence should never be considered normal , no matter what form it occurs :
I &apos;ve known disease and sensation@@ alism for several years now .
I come every day to newspaper ki@@ os@@ ks and see the pages of titles with pictures , which can only come from a text@@ book for criminals or from specialists from specialists .
it brings me out of the frame .
sometimes I feel like I am the only one who is disgu@@ sted or sad . it works like a lack of respect for the person who once belonged to that body .
I cannot be indiffer@@ ent or consider this as normal .
she writes on :
no , it is not normal that my 10 @-@ year @-@ old cous@@ in thinks he wants to become Nar@@ co ( German : drug dealers ) if he is big . and it is also not normal that people hear songs about the &quot; hero@@ ic &quot; of the offen@@ ders when they go through the streets .
for me it is as if they ridi@@ cu@@ le those who have lost someone and those who are afraid that something happens to them .
I see our weakness when stories become mere numbers in a statisti@@ c .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the in@@ action of men is incredible when the death of six people and the dis@@ appearance of 43 students in a neighboring town will be justified by being &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so@@ aked up &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I think they try to persu@@ ade them to remain spar@@ ed from such trage@@ dies when they are not stirring and silent .
Mari@@ bel L. from Mexico City wrote the contribution &quot; Four months black@@ mail in the Capital district : how a family was pl@@ under@@ ed with threats . &quot; it describes how armed criminals cr@@ ush money from their business for month , until they destroyed not only the business but also tore their family apart .
you are thinking of everything you have lost and how many people can completely change your life in just a few days .
the pain of this never fa@@ des , the trauma remains , the fear comes up again when you are alone .
habits have changed , phone numbers also .
we will contact you only if it is absolutely necessary .
the far@@ ther we are from each other , the better .
she closed her report with the words :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want the others to be arrested because you don &apos;t know when they will kidn@@ ap you or kill you . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in these terrible days I asked myself whether wines would dissolve my deep @-@ rooted feelings , but the answer is no , because I forgot how to we@@ ep . I have to learn to live with the pain .
the journalist Mario Gu@@ ti@@ Ã©r@@ rez Vega published the post &quot; The For@@ gotten Children of Ci@@ u@@ dad Ju@@ Ã¡@@ rez : a Generation of Viol@@ ence . &quot;
in the introduction he raises questions like : who cares about the child of a missing woman and a man murdered by organised crime ?
how is it possible to grow up in a settlement at the edge of the most dangerous city of Mexico ?
he is not like other boys of his age , whose parents care about them .
Br@@ yan is a orph@@ an and he tells us he had to teach himself how to cook an egg , ro@@ ast potatoes , heat tor@@ till@@ as warm and make &quot; Chi@@ chi &quot; for the babies who live with him . this is his name for preparing the bottle with water , sugar and milk powder .
he tells of the nine sc@@ ars on his left leg - one for every age of life .
but they are in@@ significant compared to the pain in his eyes - un@@ speak@@ able for a boy for whom all life consists of violence and who had to learn to live with it .
when he was five years old , he told him that his mother had disappeared .
but this was not the day when his childhood had ended .
his childhood was past two years before , when he was just a few blocks away from his home , the bloody cor@@ p@@ se of his father who had been shot by armed men from a passing car .
when Br@@ yan was born , the situation in Ju@@ Ã¡@@ rez looked like this :
Br@@ yan was born in 2006 when violence was mixed by organised crime and the fight against the existing social problems in Ju@@ Ã¡@@ rez .
in 2008 , 2009 and 2010 , Ju@@ Ã¡@@ rez was the most dangerous city in the world due to the number of mur@@ ders according to the Council of Public Security and the Government of the United States Government .
in 2010 alone , the public prosec@@ utor &apos;s office was 3@@ 103 Mor@@ des . this corresponds to 8,5 kill@@ ings per day .
these are just a few hundreds of thousands of stories that leave the organized crime in Mexico and penetrate into the soul of the country .
only a few stories continue to live in the face of new head@@ lines . but this project reminds us of those we are not allowed to forget .
in addition to the project &quot; A@@ pr@@ ender a Vi@@ vir C@@ on El Nar@@ co , &quot; Animal Pol@@ Ã­@@ tico has launched the data journ@@ alism project Nar@@ co@@ data whose objective is to represent the complex information behind the failed struggle against drug traffi@@ cking , which has tor@@ mented the country over the last four decades .
if a thousand words are worth a thousand words
&quot; sharing is Car@@ ing &quot; by Fli@@ ck@@ r user Ni@@ kl@@ as Wi@@ k@@ strÃ¶m ( CC @-@ B@@ Y @-@ NC 2.0 ) W@@ AR@@ N@@ ING : this post and the pages to which it links contain pictures depicting violence .
the fact check is important at a moment when it comes to raising a rum@@ or or expos@@ ing a fake .
but how is the year after something has emerged the first time ? content in social media , whether true or un@@ true , tends to pers@@ ist .
let us take this photo of a terrible accident seven years ago in the Democratic Republic of Congo ( DRC ) .
since its first release , it has been used to make trage@@ dies that have actually occurred in Nigeria or Myanmar .
this false coupling of image and event - &quot; wrong description &quot; or &quot; wrong context &quot; in the terminology of Global Vo@@ ices or First Dra@@ ft News - does not den@@ ies the fact that there is plenty of careful reporting about events in the DR Congo , Myanmar and Nigeria .
but it raises questions about our cra@@ ving for images on news .
what happened in the Democratic Republic of Congo
in 2010 , a tank truck crossed the town of S@@ ange in the east of the DR Congo , til@@ ted and explo@@ ded . 230 people died .
after the civil war , Africa &apos;s second @-@ largest country had been neglected for years and thus devast@@ ated . roads in the region have become dangerous paths full of po@@ thol@@ es which were difficult to navigate .
tra@@ gically , the tank truck fell victim to it .
official representatives described a fire@@ ball rolling dozens of houses including a cinema close to which was full of people watching the World Cup .
houses burned and carb@@ oni@@ zed bodies were scattered in the streets .
many people were burned to inno@@ c@@ ence .
a picture with the title &quot; Das is Nigeria . &quot; from the Im@@ g@@ ur user My@@ sti@@ cal Mon@@ key , 12 January 201@@ 5.@@ Sever@@ al photos of the incident form the horri@@ ble scenes of this day .
above is an example of this .
it shows rows of cab@@ al bodies lined up on the floor while people look at them .
but here the story does not end .
over the years , the same photo was recorded several times on social media , blo@@ gs and other platforms , wrong@@ ly attributed to real but not related trage@@ dies , especially events in Nigeria and Myanmar .
what happened in Nigeria and Myanmar
on 3 January 2015 , fighters of the B@@ oko Har@@ am attacked the remote Nig@@ eri@@ an villages of Bag@@ a and Dor@@ o G@@ ow@@ on .
eye witnesses dramatically reported atro@@ cities they had to flee .
houses and shops were burned and dead bodies were laid in streets and bushes .
there were reports , according to which 150 @-@ 2000 people were massac@@ red .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but the figures could not be confirmed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nobody stayed back to count cor@@ p@@ ses , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a human rights Watch . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
many had been dis@@ member@@ ed , shot or burned .
only on the basis of satellite images the follow @-@ up time could be depicted visually .
the occasion for the attack was also unclear , but the military base in Bag@@ a was a permanent conflict between the military Nig@@ eri@@ as and the attempt by B@@ oko Har@@ am to win the country ( examples from 2013 and 2015 ) .
and here the picture emerged from the DR Congo , when it was wrong@@ ly presented as proof of the fact and the possible extent of the attack :
this is Nigeria .
a massacre of 2,000 people took place two days after Paris .
they are not Charlie .
they are dead .
in fact , this frau@@ dul@@ ent use of the image from the DR Congo is only one in a series of abor@@ tions ; Africa Check has documented regulations on Nigeria since 2014 .
in all these cases , the picture was presented as a proof of mass kill@@ ings .
another step further brings personal comments such as this example fal@@ sely bl@@ aming the image from the DR Congo with sources of mass media in order to deliver arguments .
the picture of che@@ ek also appeared in connection with the deadly persecution of the Muslim Roh@@ ing@@ ya in Myanmar .
according to a flas@@ hing of lightning , published by the United Nations , those who were able to flee were beaten , rape and several dead , some by burning .
while others reported about the violence against Roh@@ ing@@ ya , Po@@ sts showed up like the following , who brought these descriptions together with photos from the DR Congo :
this picture comes from an Saudi Arabian news site , which fal@@ sely claimed President My@@ an@@ mar@@ s Th@@ ein being , monks and politicians had participated in the murder of Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims . in addition , she had used the image from the DR Congo to portra@@ y this information .
the original contribution , which was last accessed on 26 April 2017 , can be accessed here .
other news organizations that called AF@@ P as their source had also fal@@ sely attributed this statement to Th@@ ein , but they did not have the image of DR Congo related .
the worldwide reach of false information
traces of this false coupling date back to 2011 and 2012 and are actually coming from all over the world .
with the help of an inver@@ ted picture search , you can see how far information can cross borders .
a revers@@ ed picture search with the Tin@@ aa search engine has found 3@@ 44 pictures under 18.@@ 8 billion pictures ( as of May 3 , 2017 ) , which are very similar to the said picture from the DR Congo .
they come from a mixed mas@@ h of private pages , social media platforms , and national and national publications and are available in many different languages such as English , Russian , Spanish , Arabic , Dutch , German , Greek and Portuguese .
some have re@@ directed false reports , some have tried others to expose the fal@@ si@@ fications .
we have im@@ par@@ ted examples of mis@@ use and associated with the respective countries , on the basis of which they were published on which page they were published . this means that we want to represent the range more clearly than by the language alone .
from the countries listed below ( which in some cases have also been linked to each other ) several examples of ab@@ u@@ sive use may come from .
here are some cases that can now be felt completely ( on the map in orange ) :
map : News Fra@@ mes .
country examples of wrong coupl@@ ers from the DR Congo with Nigeria or Myanmar .
the orange states point to pages or servers that are still available through the examples of fal@@ si@@ fications or false statements .
the Coun@@ tries in Gra@@ y are examples that , according to the metadata and information available via Tin@@ aa , are probably also indic@@ ative examples .
as a reminder , the source of the picture is the Democratic Republic of the Congo ( in blue ) .
Algeria , 2012 . &quot; what happens in Burma - Myanmar ? &quot; a link to the picture taken from the DR Congo was posted in an online discussion forum ( addressed to Algeri@@ ans and interested Arabs ) as part of a Th@@ reads to the &quot; War of Budd@@ hi@@ sts against Muslims . &quot;

Canada , 2015 .
in this article , a blo@@ gger from Que@@ bec City not only ren@@ ames the false report but also disc@@ usses the abuse of the image from the DR Congo in connection with Nigeria as well as further questions about the intentions of the persons and the trage@@ dies involved in it ( in the DR Congo and beyond ) .

T@@ wit@@ ter@@ contributions after the B@@ oko Har@@ am massacre like this one , who used the image from the DR Congo to illustrate the atro@@ cities of Islam , have clearly seen no sites like Ho@@ ax@@ bu@@ ster that refu@@ te this .

Nigeria , 2012 .
even within Nigeria , the photo from the DR Congo became a proof of the bom@@ b@@ ings of the B@@ oko Har@@ am in K@@ ano in public discussion forums .
Malaysia , 2015 .
Malaysia offers two extreme examples of ab@@ u@@ sive use of the image from the DR Congo , with a tweet that expresses sympathy towards Nig@@ eri@@ an massacre and on the other hand the attempt of a blo@@ gger to del@@ egi@@ timi@@ ze the asser@@ tions that Roh@@ ing@@ ya are being prosec@@ uted , since the photos were used impro@@ per@@ ly .
Myanmar , 2017 .
the Myanmar government published a correction of what they considered &quot; deliberately dark news and photos , international media , international human rights organisations and governments , in an attempt to create mis@@ understand@@ ings with regard to Myanmar . &quot;
this recti@@ fication , which has been published exclusively in English , also includes references to fake images of rum@@ ors that are run by H@@ ate Spe@@ ech and used by extrem@@ ist groups in order to demonstrate that Muslims kill Budd@@ hi@@ sts and vice versa ( which is often spread by Bur@@ m@@ ese nation@@ alists ) .
Russia , 2012 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; F@@ erg@@ o &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( Christi@@ an@@ opho@@ bia or political pro@@ vocation ? ) &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this post , directed to the members of the Russian Orthodox community , makes it clear that the image of the DR Congo does NOT show Muslims to kill Christians .
Saudi Arabia , 2012 / 2014 .
this news page fal@@ sely asser@@ ted that the President of Myanmar Th@@ ein had admitted his 2012 that monks and politicians were involved in killing the Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims and brought the story together with the picture of ange .
the article was updated in 2014 and at the time of this release the picture continues to contain it .
Spain , 2015 / 2016 .
this article from 2014 on students who were killed by the B@@ oko Har@@ am , published by the now deleted , Catholic near news page An@@ Ã¡@@ li@@ sis Digital , has expressly declared that the image does not originate from the kill@@ ings , but it claims that it portra@@ ys a &quot; similar jihadi@@ st attack . &quot;
when the picture later came into circulation in connection with the B@@ oko Har@@ am massacre , the newspaper El Pa@@ is tried to refu@@ te that there were connections to Nigeria .
Turkey , 2015 . &quot; # Ni@@ jer@@ y@@ a@@ Yan@@ Ä±@@ y@@ or@@ DÃ¼n@@ y@@ a@@ U@@ y@@ u@@ y &quot; ( Nigeria is burning , the world is asleep ) .
the image of DR Congo emerged with this T@@ wit@@ ter@@ h@@ ash@@ tag and triggered a discussion among Muslims after the massacre of the B@@ oko Har@@ am 2015 and the attack on Charlie Heb@@ do in Paris .
they wanted to achieve greater attention to these events that took place in the name of Islam .
United States , 2015 .
the picture was weather@@ ed as evidence of the B@@ oko Har@@ am massacre in 2015 ( and more than 9,@@ 300 times ) , but the messages associated with it were not taken up in any religious context .
instead , the goal was to pay attention to the relative number of deaths and a comparison of media coverage compared to Nigeria and the attack on Charlie Heb@@ do .
Vietnam ( Vietnam@@ ese ) , 2014 .
after a message which was allegedly written by a &quot; Father Juan Carlos Mar@@ tos &quot; about the Nig@@ eri@@ an massacre , there were discussion forums such as this in Vietnam@@ ese and declared it to be false .
the organization of the Clar@@ et@@ tin mission@@ aries and Fr . Juan Carlos Mar@@ tos dist@@ anced themselves from the message in which the picture was contained in DR Congo .
there are other confirmed examples of an er@@ ron@@ eous use of the image from Sweden , Poland , Belgium , the Netherlands and Argentina .
other accounts , ag@@ gregation and pages in the following countries ( on the portfolio in grey ) , Tin@@ aa also points , but are no longer fully trac@@ eable : Czech Republic , Australia , India , Peru , Netherlands , Ethiopia , Sri Lanka , Azerbaijan , Japan and possibly China .
( data entries with URLs and time / date stamps exist on the web craw@@ ler and occasionally they have image file names in connection with Nigeria or Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims . )
in all these cases , which appeared only mark@@ edly after the original version of 2010 , the picture might ultimately be a correct description , but the original contribution is not available or accessible .
frames and pictures
there are two strong topics or frames that pass through these posts . the first frame focuses on religion .
the photo was used in relation to greater discussions on the silence related to the kill@@ ings of Christians by Muslims or - to defend the Muslims - the kill@@ ings of Roh@@ ing@@ y@@ as by Budd@@ hi@@ sts .
a second fra@@ ming uses the image to discuss how an African life is under@@ valued compared to a European or French life .
to understand religion and the value of human life is both important . therefore , it is worth examining how images are used in connection with these efforts .
a deeper question , however , is what happens when readers can no longer believe these images .
with social media there are tens of people who in@@ ad@@ vert@@ ently share the water around a tragedy .
suggestion this mood of mis@@ information and false information that actual atro@@ cities are un@@ true and em@@ bel@@ lish the real horror of what has actually happened in the DR Congo , Nigeria and Myanmar ?
the spread of violent images has already been deb@@ ated extensively ( for example ) .
one argument is that with@@ holding images from a refusal to recognize the tragedy . sometimes these images are even demanded by the victims themselves .
at the same time , the concern is that violent images are des@@ ensi@@ ti@@ zing readers and viewers and emp@@ ower them to feel emp@@ athy ( such as this study that examines how forci@@ ble media are working to help others ) .
while there is a lot to discuss about violent represent@@ ations in the news media , the fact is that they are indispensable for today &apos;s news reporting .
technologi@@ sts are experim@@ enting with algorithms to support the fight against &quot; fake news . &quot; they will have to think thoroughly about the situation in which a picture suggests something , which can also be used detached from context or completely mis@@ use .
however , any investigation of false attri@@ butions should also take into account how international they can be .

the &quot; un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able &quot; blog reveals the uniqu@@ eness of smaller languages
photo by Andy S@@ imm@@ ons uses CC B@@ Y @-@ ND 2.0 license .
a blog with the name un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able ( e. g. un@@ miss@@ able ) endeav@@ ours to offer speech enthusiasts a selection of words from around the world that are difficult or not to translate at all .
there are such words in every language : they express certain situations or feelings that are often very complex or specific .
some of these irre@@ plac@@ eable words are already well known today ( like the famous Portuguese sau@@ da@@ de ) and others deeply rooted in a special culture ( for example the Spanish Sob@@ ot@@ esa ) .
but everyone stub@@ bor@@ n@@ ly resist@@ s every attempt of a simple translation .
one word or expression is not enough , which is why a complete explanation and sometimes some context is necessary to understand exactly what is meant by this one word .
these unique words have been collected in an online list for quite a while .
most of these lists treat Japanese , German , French , Portuguese or Finnish words while the author and lingu@@ ist of &quot; un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able &quot; Steven Bird decided to focus on small languages .
in the blog you can find for example words from the Mw@@ ot@@ lap language of Van@@ u@@ at@@ u , such as :
&quot; v@@ ak@@ ast@@ eg@@ lo@@ k &quot; - Wa@@ it for your parents in recognition of what they have done for you in your younger years .
and words in the Hun@@ s@@ rik language spoken in parts of Brazil , such as :
&quot; k@@ w@@ adi &quot; - The comfort or la@@ z@@ iness you feel after being war@@ med up in the sun on cold days .
in Bir@@ ds &apos; own words from his blog about :
they dec@@ eive other cultures , reveal other forms of thought and awaken our curiosity .
sometimes , how we analyze the world around us and classi@@ fy the lingu@@ ists on this page would like to publish more of these &quot; irre@@ plac@@ eable &quot; words and show how different , valuable and impres@@ sively these small languages are .
speakers of the Treas@@ ure Languages , which are highly appreciated by un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able , are invited to upload their favorite wines here .

how Sri Lanka is dealing with the worst floo@@ ding of the decade
the island state of Sri Lanka is currently facing the worst floo@@ ding and land@@ slide catastrophe in this decade .
triggered by the mon@@ soon , which normally uses at the end of May , the rivers Kal@@ u , Kel@@ ani , G@@ in , N@@ il@@ wal@@ a and At@@ tan@@ ag@@ alu O@@ ya have entered into 15 districts in the south and west of the country .
after an opinion of the disaster centre of Sri Lanka on 28 May 2017 , 126 people were killed and nearly 100 people are missing because of the floods and mud floods .
over 400@@ ,000 people have been affected since last Friday ( 26 May ) and about 100,000 people have been brought to 304 safe places of stay .
the rainf@@ alls ceased on Saturday ( 27 May ) , and the water levels in some areas slowly declined .
the health and hygiene conditions of the population represent a massive challenge in the areas affected and still in@@ accessible .
the following pictures and videos convey an impression of the extent of the flood disaster :
floo@@ ding in Ta@@ wal@@ ama town with water levels of up to 7.5 meters . Twitter users such as A@@ zz@@ am A@@ me@@ en and Sri Lanka T@@ we@@ et deliver regular updates to flood situations .
many use the H@@ ash@@ tag # F@@ loo@@ d@@ SL to monitor the extent of the disaster .
Sri Lanka &apos;s deadly floods wor@@ sen the Den@@ gue crisis , warns Save the Children , after further rainf@@ alls are already on their way .
today , the Nel@@ u@@ wa bus stood in the high water , water level up to 6 meters . village Mor@@ ago@@ da near G@@ alle likewise floo@@ ded due to the water p@@ eg@@ els of the Mor@@ o@@ go@@ da El@@ a yesterday .
the Air Force has provided five aircraft for rescue operations and another five are to be completed for the transport of emergency supplies for the inhabitants included in their floo@@ ded villages .
various organizations and startups are also ready to help .
help Flo@@ od Vic@@ tims in Sri Lanka and 2017 Dis@@ aster Relief - Information Des@@ k@@ - Sri Lanka provide important information on flood situations and humanitarian aid .
if any search and rescue teams require dr@@ ones for their operations , please call 0@@ 77@@ 48@@ 4@@ 46@@ 39 .
for those who want to don@@ ate dry food and vital supplies for flood victims -
today we are in the area around Kel@@ eni@@ ya and Him@@ but@@ ana .
please call the number 0@@ 77@@ 7@@ 44@@ 97@@ 29 or 0@@ 77@@ 78@@ 4@@ 38@@ 41 today if animals need help in this area .
the Taxi call @-@ App Pick@@ Me ( Sri Lanka ) asks anxi@@ ous people to share their location data with the help of the app so that the Kat@@ ast@@ op@@ enz@@ entrum will be informed .
last year after the disaster of the tropical storm Ro@@ an@@ u , Pick@@ Me introduced a &quot; flood aid &quot; button which allowed users to call a vehicle to collect assistance and donations .
they also introduced a &quot; S@@ OS &quot; button which resulted in more than a thousand requests and 150 successful boat rescue operations for people trapped by floods and land@@ slides .
the united efforts of the government and the civilian population of Sri Lanka , in which several social media platforms are fully exploited , bring people in need of security and contribute to aid measures .
this has prevented the loss of further lives , and the population of Sri Lanka is now the long way to the restoration of norm@@ ality .

the Women &apos;s March on January 21 , 2017 in San Francisco .
photo of Sah@@ ar Hab@@ i@@ b G@@ haz@@ i .
in January I took part in the Women &apos;s March in San Francisco with a neighbour and love friend .
I trust in her my four years old daughter ; she confi@@ deth in me her children : she is my rock in the surf .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the one minute we call for slo@@ gans for women &apos;s rights . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the next we channel rights for trans@@ gender . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we are in a sea of umbrellas and people , some consider the iconic image of a woman with head@@ sc@@ arf high , bound from an American flag , others gu@@ essing slo@@ gans against Islam@@ opho@@ bia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my friend looks at me and says , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; These things don &apos;t concern you , or ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why , because I am not Muslim ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I ask . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I have already led this conversation .
people with whom I work or people who have known me for years separate me - the Sah@@ ar who know them - of the widespread concept of &quot; Muslims &quot; that has built up in their imagination .
they have been ex@@ ci@@ pl@@ ating me .
there are 1.7 billion Muslims worldwide .
we don &apos;t all look alike .
we practice our religion differently .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we identify ourselves to be a Muslim , in different ways . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but somehow we all are put into the same Muslim drawer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this drawer is so well constructed in our collective imagination that as soon as Muslims , as I do not fit there , become ent@@ ati@@ fied .
to be de@@ hydr@@ ated
I don &apos;t stand alone .
this is even done to the poet whose poetry is most widely sold in America : Rum@@ i .
what images do you have in mind when you think of him ?
love ?
peace ?
when Jal@@ al@@ ud@@ din Rum@@ i was as old as I am now , he was an orthodo@@ x Muslim pre@@ acher and schol@@ ar .
Islam , the Kor@@ an and Prophet Muhammad were the centre of his poetry as far as the day he died .
but in the western idea , the religion of Rum@@ i was er@@ ased , as well as from the most popular translations of his poetry .
this del@@ eting makes a large part of the history of the 1.7 billion Muslims in this world .
another exists in the reduc@@ tion@@ ist images of Muslims that have been colon@@ ising Western books for centuries .
this temp@@ ting language is determined by the dark man you should fear and the exotic woman you should save .
in the 1970s , the ground@@ breaking Palestinian scientist Edward S@@ aid bl@@ amed the story behind these images .
but these paintings still stand out today .
our politicians , the news industry and Hollywood continue to delay them .
I have been working in the news industry for thir@@ teen years and I have seen how these powerful , flaw@@ ed narr@@ atives dominate our news feeds .
this narrative over@@ shad@@ owed the reality that in the last three decades nine Muslim women have led their countries , while the US won &apos;t even choose their first female presidential candidate in 2016 .
this narrative fails to acknowledge that if French , Muslim women are prevented from wearing their head@@ sc@@ arf in public buildings and Saudi @-@ Arab , Muslim women are forced by their government to cover their entire body , which is both two sides of the same coin .
a powerful group exercises its &quot; control &quot; on the &quot; other . &quot;
this powerful nar@@ ration weak@@ ens Muslim women who lead movements for change .
it also sees that the first Muslim prayers were spoken on American soil by Afri@@ cans who had been brought here with slave ships .
it del@@ etes the existence of Qu@@ eer Muslims .
this narrative has occupied our collective imagination so deep and flaw@@ ed that often Si@@ kh men and children become the goal of anti @-@ Muslim attacks and har@@ ass@@ ment .
because of these stories , which we tell and because of the way in which we tell them , Islam@@ opho@@ bia is not only fear of Islam , religion , but fear of the &quot; other . &quot;
among the 1.7 billion
in the news industry , we do more than just tell stories that are based on facts .
or on alternative facts .
we also create narr@@ atives that help us understand the world .
and my industry has f@@ abul@@ ously failed to grasp the narrative of 1.7 billion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and we have failed here , where seven million Muslims make up the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; diverse &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; religious group &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in America . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
more than one @-@ third of the entire Muslim population are African @-@ ethnic Americans .
six of ten American Muslims are among the first generation immigrants coming from 77 countries .
the parents of the author 1976 in New York .
use approved .
four decades ago , my immig@@ rated parents came to New York to live their American dream .
my mother laid their first jewelry design on 5th Avenue and my father worked hard in the sky@@ scra@@ pers of New York ; sky@@ scra@@ pers were made possible by the Muslim , American St@@ ati@@ ker from Bangladesh named Faz@@ l@@ ur Rah@@ man Khan .
at that time when Khan had imagined the world &apos;s sky@@ lines , my parents were ir@@ relevant Muslims and Americans .
but am I now a Muslim and American ?
sometimes when people ask me why I don &apos;t eat pork , I say - instead of extrac@@ ting my Muslim recipes or my handy hand@@ ker@@ chief that all Muslims carry with them - &quot; out of respect for Pep@@ pa W@@ utz . &quot;
I joke , we don &apos;t carry all the bags with us .
we don &apos;t have to be the@@ ological experts to be &quot; Muslim &quot; or to be almost always selected for additional security checks at the airport .
there are hundreds of outstanding Muslim scholars , Muslim activists and inter@@ religious activists seeking to fight widespread lies about Islam .
these lies are produced by a well @-@ lubric@@ ated Islamic state machine with credi@@ tors , think tanks and experts for false information that our already er@@ ron@@ eous image of what a Muslim is ; or what Islam is , have manipul@@ ated .
because of the stories we tell and because of the way in which we tell them , Islam@@ opho@@ bia is more than just a foreig@@ ner who tears the veil away from a woman .
or as the terri@@ fying map of attacks on mos@@ ques throughout the USA , see below .
screen@@ shot of the AC@@ L@@ U website .
Islam@@ opho@@ bia in its ug@@ ly forms attacks our affili@@ ation .
it attacks our identity , which is so widespread , so versatile and multi@@ faceted that it is impossible to fit into a drawer .

use approved .
I would like to explain this .
I was born as a Muslim but a Muslim was only born into my imagination when I was four years old in a provisional mos@@ que in the basement of a pres@@ by@@ ter@@ ian church in New York .
when social scientists describe religious life , they refer to the following terms : belief , behavior and belonging .
my Muslim belief and behaviour may not always be visible , but they are there .
perhaps my girlfriend , my neighbor , would see my rock in the surf that I am Muslim if she could look through the 15 meters of concrete and air that separate our houses .
she would see the evening ritual with my daughter when I was silent in my arms and whis@@ per@@ ing her the Arab verses to protect the Qur &apos;@@ an and called the Q@@ ul@@ s .
each of them I repeat three times .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I ask that it is protected from evil , the evil one can see and the evil one cannot see . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
my Muslim belief may not always be visible , but my Muslim relationship is always part of my shadow .
the grand@@ mother of the author , when she wins an icon competition in Kar@@ achi , with her sisters at some point in the 196@@ 0@@ ies .
use approved .
belonging is the image of my grand@@ mother mat@@ ernal side with her sisters , how they gained a competition of art of flower arrangement in Kar@@ achi decades ago .
it is the image of her that I see in this moment when I close my eyes : nano , surrounded by her finished and incomplete paintings , Su@@ fi saint ; and a Kor@@ an with many book@@ marks , a book with one hundred and fourteen chapters , which she can almost mem@@ ori@@ ze .
to be Muslim means to speak the prayers that she had told me when I had a bad day .
to be Muslim is how she taught me to refer to God : Allah Mi@@ an , what God means , my only Lord .
for a people that - over centuries - has been col@@ oni@@ zed by an empire , founded by a company with the name of the Ven@@ erable British East Stal@@ lion Company , it has a deep meaning to call God my only Lord .
the author in 1987 with her grandfather .
use approved .
belonging means to grow up and to hear that men do not we@@ ep , but at the same time see that my immig@@ rant grandfather cri@@ es .
in the meantime , while writing books on modern Islam and the independence of K@@ ash@@ mir@@ s , N@@ ana J@@ aan was forced to cry out for his family in the K@@ ash@@ mir family , who was not allowed to join his arms in half a century .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; belonging to it is that there are millions of Kur@@ ds and Palestinians , whose families , like my grandfather , have been torn apart by col@@ oni@@ alists who have shared the Muslim world as at play risk . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
to be Muslim means knowing that in the last two centuries , Europeans have &quot; col@@ oni@@ alized &quot; all of them to four Muslim countries .
it means knowing that the first fighter @-@ bomb of history was thrown off over a Muslim country before a century ago .
it means knowing that at the same time the grandfather of my grand@@ mother , an Indian , ash@@ mir@@ y subject of the British empire , was referred to as &quot; dangerous &quot; by the newspapers of his time , as he led the first mos@@ que in England .
before there were planes , he travelled to more parts of the world than I ever was and preached the radical word of love , peace and social justice .
the Word of Islam .

belonging to my Muslim tribe of 1.7 billion goes deep into our unforgettable family trees ; our un@@ acknowledged history .
it means remember@@ ing that fourteen years ago , the most powerful military in the world , with troops distributed across every continent except Antar@@ c@@ tica , went to Iraq to pursue weapons of mass destruction that did not exist .
it means knowing that more than half a million Ira@@ q@@ is are buried beneath the ruins of the war .
to be an American Muslim means knowing that the suicide rate among veter@@ ans has risen by more than 32 per cent since 2001 .
it means knowing that when a tragedy visited the US and the suspect is carrying a Muslim name , history is reported four times more than a story with a white bom@@ bing .
it means knowing that fourteen hundred years ago , the first call of prayer , the Az@@ aan , was called Bil@@ al by a liber@@ ated black slave .
it means knowing that two hundred years ago an African schol@@ ar called Bil@@ ali Muhammad was ens@@ la@@ ved and brought to this country .
it means nam@@ ing Mal@@ col@@ m X an American hero .
it is the warmth that I feel when people crowded the airports to fight against the Muslim B@@ an .
it is the hope that I feel when we stand up for our dreams and when we say black life .
to be an American , a Pak@@ ist@@ ani , a P@@ ah@@ ari , a P@@ ah@@ ari , a Pun@@ j@@ ab@@ i , a Muslim and a journalist means the inherent inter@@ sec@@ tion@@ ality of our identi@@ ties with multiple hy@@ phen , but fail to communicate them to others .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the 1.7 billion Nar@@ r@@ ative har@@ bours more possibilities than a magic cube , but is represented in the reduced branch of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
to be a mother means to take care of my child and all Muslim children , knowing that powerful and privileged people are building structural anti @-@ Islam hos@@ tility .
structural Islam@@ opho@@ bia exists in the Muslim registri@@ es , which began with President Bush and expanded under President Obama .
it consists of continuous monitoring of mos@@ ques .
it is in the immigration officer who takes a five year old child in hand@@ cu@@ ffs .
it is in a country that seals its borders towards people from the countries that bom@@ bard it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a false and ne@@ bul@@ ous &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; No @-@ F@@ ly @-@ List &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which largely targets Arabs and Muslims . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is the wars that we wage and the bombs that we reject on Muslim countries .
because of the stories we tell and because of those we don &apos;t tell , we are here today .
in a study entitled A@@ scent of Man , scientists from the Nor@@ th@@ western University presented a scientifically un@@ real image and asked them to assess groups on a scale of 1 to 100 with regard to evolution .
Muslims got the lowest score .
the Con@@ vers@@ ations We Need To Lead
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are deeply involved in enth@@ ron@@ izing the Muslim or the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; other &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we have decades back to recognise the roots of our fears and the flaw@@ ed and dangerous im@@ prints we keep in our news editorial offices .
at least there is a growing movement led by American Muslims within the media industry trying to capture our multiple identi@@ ties and forgotten history .
the Pod@@ cast Lake Som@@ e@@ thing , S@@ ay Som@@ e@@ thing of Bu@@ zz@@ feed ; the viral video series Secret Li@@ ves of Muslims ; Sap@@ el@@ o Square about black , American Muslims ; Simon &amp; amp ; Schu@@ ster Sal@@ am Re@@ ads , an initiative to print more Muslim authors and Ms Mar@@ vel , the PA@@ K@@ IS@@ TA@@ N@@ IS@@ CH , Muslim , American super@@ hero - all this makes me hope .

col@@ lage of the author .
but I am concerned about this difficult global time in which we are .
and this moment has consequences that go beyond the 1.7 billion .
there is a reason that conspiracy the@@ orists who existed in the dark corners of the Internet now lead the White House .
they have grown expon@@ enti@@ ally because they have made Muslims &quot; others . &quot;
there is another group that has grown expon@@ enti@@ ally by creating the &quot; other . &quot;
a few years before , it had not yet existed ; now they master large areas in Syria and Iraq .
I am concerned about the realities and the history that I was not aware of when I was as old as it is now my daughter , but that made me today an essential Muslim .
things I have left here like a bread@@ cr@@ umb path in my speech .
things that perhaps awaken memories , as in all the inter@@ sections that make up our humanity , there may be a story where someone is made to a &quot; other . &quot;
right now , on the other side of the bridge in Berkeley , conversations are taking place within the framework of the 8th Annual Conference on Islam@@ opho@@ bia .
more than a hundred acade@@ mi@@ cians speak about our problems with the &quot; other , &quot; &quot; structural rac@@ ism &quot; and &quot; American militar@@ ism . &quot;
but these are not terms with which we usually throw in our schools around us or that we read in our newspapers .
poster of the fac@@ eb@@ ook@@ side of the Islam@@ opho@@ bia studies network .
we all need to ask ourselves why ?
why do I tell this here at this TE@@ D@@ x Talk 2017 in Stan@@ ford , where , however , Edward S@@ aid , the man who showed us how wars will be led and people are en@@ cir@@ cl@@ ed by creating the &quot; other &quot; in the public imagination , was even more scientific than Stan@@ ford four decades ago .
we have to ask ourselves uncomfortable questions about the role of consciously and un@@ consciously doing the &quot; other . &quot; as my girlfriend and I present in the rain during the Women &apos;s March , because the occupation is that we have no president who feeds chocolate cake while he already sp@@ ills broken countries and &quot; other man @-@ made &quot; people , goes far beyond the visible and invisible 1.7 billion .

story telling , by Fli@@ ck@@ r user Daniele Ros@@ si , using the CC B@@ Y @-@ NC @-@ ND 2.0 license .
can there be a way to get in touch with someone here and now despite a language barrier ?
for Steven Bird and Rob@@ yn Per@@ ry , founder of the Treas@@ ure Language Stor@@ y@@ telling initiative ( T@@ LS ) , telling stories in their original language is a possible answer .
global Vo@@ ices reported recently about another initiative by Steven Bird , the irre@@ plac@@ eable blog .
here , however , the focus of T@@ LS is not on the written word but on the spoken word . it is an attempt to preserve and appreciate the language diversity of big cities .
in fact , in urban areas like Melbourne and Darwin in Australia or O@@ ak@@ land in the United States , where T@@ LS has held events since 2015 , there is a risk that small and not quite so small languages are not passed on to the children born there .
the following applies to the makers of the project :
the mass mortality of the languages of the world can be avoided if we create cities that embrace diversity - safe spaces where inhabitants don &apos;t have to forget who they are to belong .
while &quot; listening often is connected to understanding , &quot; these events instead &quot; aim to listen , to appreciate , to make sense . &quot;
in this format , stor@@ y@@ t@@ ellers first introduce their story in their own language and then translate or explain it in English .
even if the participants are not professional stor@@ y@@ t@@ ellers , their dedication and representation lead to the fact that audiences are involved .
they cry out laugh@@ ing and emotion , as if the language is no longer a barrier .
the following video shows , for example , a traditional story from Burkina Faso , which is told in the language of D@@ af@@ ing . during this round , the stor@@ y@@ t@@ eller R@@ assi@@ dat@@ ou Kon@@ ate also takes the opportunity to explain the typical customs of narrative art for her country .
in another event John Ny@@ am@@ us tells the f@@ ist of the h@@ are and the bab@@ oon in the language Sh@@ ona from Zimbabwe :
after explaining the meaning of his f@@ ist John Ny@@ am@@ us is asked : &quot; how do you speak to an audience that doesn &apos;t understand your language ? &quot; with a broad smile , he shares his feeling of inclusion :
you listened to it !
they were attentive ...
they were all with me !
so far the events of Treas@@ ure Language Stor@@ y@@ telling have taken place in three cities , and the organizers hope to extend this . all who are inspired by the project can contact T@@ LS to organize their own stor@@ y@@ telling shows .
Puerto Rico calls for a re @-@ establishment of public debt
with the objective of re@@ viewing the public debt of Puerto Rico , which amounts to 72 million US dollars , various religious and bourgeois organizations took part in a mass demonstration on 3 April 2017 ; the march started in Cap@@ it@@ ol , the government building of the capital , and went down to Plaza de Col@@ Ã³n in the old town of San Ju@@ an .
it was proclaimed by the group &quot; Fren@@ te Ci@@ u@@ dad@@ ano p@@ or la Audi@@ tor@@ Ã­a de la Deu@@ da &quot; ( Ci@@ tiz@@ ens Front for the Ne@@ ural Testing of Deb@@ t ) and the Com@@ edy Church Assembly of Puerto Ri@@ cos .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the advoc@@ ates of the re @-@ determination of debt have also submitted a petition on the official homepage of the White House of the United States . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is their claim :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the people of Puerto Ri@@ cos demand that politicians , bank@@ ers and government agencies responsible for debts will be held accoun@@ table for their corruption . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we demand a financial audit and a Ste@@ ering Committee with no personal interest in public debt , with a fixed , our working conditions corresponding remuneration , which acts in favor of the economy .
we are black@@ ma@@ iled and oppressed .
the people of Puerto Rico refuse to pay a debt that is not thei@@ rs .
we will not choose between education and health .
our pen@@ sion@@ ers will not settle with sin@@ king pension payments .
we demand immediate action .
the island is not located in the state @-@ owned sovereign territory of the United States - suffering from a severe financial crisis .
therefore , the so @-@ called &quot; Centre for New Economy , &quot; an independent non @-@ profit organization without a party affili@@ ation with a focus on soci@@ o@@ economic development , proposes a law on state responsibility , as an alternative to the existing state view .
these are their reasons :
the economic and financial crisis of Puerto Ri@@ cos requires a large restructuring of the state infrastructure .
measures imposed on the outside will run without the participation and conviction of the citizens to be rejected by the people .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the demonstration wore the name &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; night watch for light and truth . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

the Syrian @-@ Palestinian web developer Bass@@ el K@@ hart@@ ab@@ il , also known as Bass@@ el Saf@@ adi , is missing for over a year .
but he is not forgotten .
more than five years after being arrested by the Syrian regime , his supporters and relatives continue the campaign for his freedom and recall the contributions he has made for an open network .
at this year &apos;s re : Publi@@ ca , the annual conference on digital culture that is held in Berlin , an event dedicated to the # Free@@ Bass@@ el campaign was dedicated to this event .
MÃ©@@ lan@@ ie D@@ ul@@ ong de Ros@@ n@@ ay , a scientist of the CN@@ RS Institute for Communication Sciences , and Barbara R@@ Ã¼h@@ ling , Managing Director of Book Spr@@ ints , a publisher of books completed by so @-@ called &apos; Book Spr@@ ints &apos; within three to five days , read excer@@ pts from the book Cost of Freedom : a Coll@@ ective In@@ quiry ( The cost of freedom : a collective research ) .
the book , which was published last year and is available free of charge , contains a number of articles dealing with free culture in the face of oppression .
it is a tribute to Bass@@ el and his work .
in the introduction it means :
this book would like to discuss how movements are built for free knowledge and what are the real costs associated with it .
activists , artists , designers , developers , researchers and authors who are involved in the movements for Free Knowledge have worked side by side to look beyond the fog that surrounds our news@@ feeds and to create some sense from our various experiences .
this book is an attempt to free Bass@@ el K@@ hart@@ ab@@ il , the beloved and celebrated Internet Vol@@ un@@ te@@ er , who has been det@@ ained in Syria since 15 March 2012 .
his name was deleted from the directory of the A@@ dra prison in which he was sitting on 3 October 2015 .
since then , we have no information about its current state or where@@ ab@@ outs .
the introduc@@ tory part of his book with the title collective memory gives his friends and his family a voice that insist@@ ed on his release and who want to know him back in his normal life and freedom , instantly .
seeing how Bass@@ el pays a high price for his participation in a free culture has many of us begin to think about their own dest@@ ini@@ es , actions and decisions .
why are we here today ?
what did we choose ?
what have we given up in this process from time to time ?
web developer for open source and digital activ@@ ist has been in custody of Syrian government authorities since March 2012 .
in October 2015 , Bass@@ el was transferred from the A@@ dra prison , a non @-@ military institution , to an unknown location .
his wife , the writer and lawyer N@@ our@@ a G@@ haz@@ i reported that the &quot; military police Bass@@ el &quot; had taken part in A@@ dra as a &quot; strictly secret &quot; command of the military court . &quot;
G@@ haz@@ i reported that on 12 November 2015 , they had been contacted by individuals who presented themselves as inside the Assad government and informed them of an alleged death sentence against their husband .
his where@@ ab@@ outs and condition remain unknown .
a pioneer of the Creative Comm@@ ons in Syria and actively involved in projects such as Mozilla Firefox and Wikipedia , Bass@@ el played a crucial role in expanding access to the Internet and knowledge for the public in Syria .
Barry Th@@ re@@ w , a designer , techn@@ ologist , and currently the director of New Pal@@ my@@ ra , a project that founded Bass@@ el writes on pages 10 and 11 of the book :
perhaps none of Bas@@ lan &apos;s cultural prototypes was more pro@@ vision@@ ary than the work he began with a group of archae@@ ologists and 3D artists around 2005 to virtually re@@ construct the ancient ruins of Pal@@ my@@ ra .
Pal@@ my@@ ra , one of the most important archaeological sites in the world , was the cross of numerous civili@@ zations , and here , Greek @-@ Roman architecture groups merge with local traditions and Persian influences .
at that time , Bass@@ el didn &apos;t know that ten years after he started this work , the IS would put everything on it , this architecture that em@@ bodies not only the cultural heritage of Sy@@ s@@ ri@@ ens but the world .
this strike in digital archae@@ ology and conservation has created a time capsule that will be in@@ valuable to the public as well as for scientists and artists in the future .
tra@@ gically , Bass@@ el did not finish this project until now .
N@@ our@@ a G@@ haz@@ i also contributed to her book and writes about her husband &apos;s passion to share his knowledge with others even during his time in prison :
I spent my entire life dre@@ aming of freedom and Bass@@ el taught me to embrace her .
I am overwhel@@ med when I call his name .
Bass@@ el taught me English even when he was in jail .
I learned to read , write and speak English well .
he has always shared his knowledge with anyone who asked him . he taught other prisoners to read , write and speak English .
Bass@@ el opened the door to the technology . he taught me to use both computers and smartphones .
he taught me the internet .
he also taught other prisoners how they use computers , at least theore@@ tically , without actually holding one in their hands .
G@@ haz@@ i is also the author of Wa@@ iting ( Wa@@ iting ) , a pro@@ mul@@ gation that she wrote to her husband in 2012 @-@ 2015 when he was in custody .
Bass@@ el and N@@ our@@ a have worked together in the book for a year .
she s@@ mu@@ g@@ gled the lyrics to him when she visited him and he translated it from Arabic into English .
the book is available in a license @-@ free version .
book cover by Y@@ ous@@ se@@ f Ab@@ dal@@ ki .
the book is dedicated to the public domain .
here is an excer@@ pt from the book of Nor@@ a titled &quot; It happens &quot; :
it happens every visit ,
that I sink in the world of your enchanting eyes ,
that I lose the mind in the moment we embrace ourselves ,
that I don &apos;t care about any of the dangers ,
each of the f@@ ences , sh@@ ac@@ kl@@ es and guards
I forget the pris@@ ons of the prison
and I will enter into every detail of your voice and words ,
which I carry with passion with me ,
when your eyes say good@@ bye
and I leave another piece of my soul with you ...
I return to my lon@@ el@@ iness quickly ,
to rec@@ la@@ im all these moments ,
and to cry over your absence and smile .
I am convinced myself that I will return soon ...
on the first anniversary of the detention of Bass@@ el , G@@ haz@@ i wrote :
one year passes , my soul
during the course of the year
I am in your cage ,
and you are still in the cage of monsters
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the story of the Bo@@ iled story is not unique in Syria . &quot; &quot;
since the beginning of the protests against the Bas@@ har al @-@ Assad regime in 2011 , more than 65@@ ,000 people have disappeared according to the Syrian Network for Human Rights ( Syrian Network for Human Rights ) .
those arrested or disappeared under violence by the regime were tor@@ tured or even executed .
by 2016 , according to the international human rights organisation Am@@ ne@@ sty International has died at least 17@@ 7@@ 23 Syrians in prison .
the stories of many other people remain unknown .
the Global Vo@@ ices community has been calling for Bass@@ el since 2012 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today , we repeat our demand in the hope that we have to do this for the last time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Moz@@ ambique : due to corruption @-@ convic@@ ted director after release from prison again on previous post
Moz@@ ambique re@@ acted with anger on a corruption in which a member of the government returned to work in the state machine after half his sentence to the place where corruption was committed .
this is Di@@ od@@ ino Cam@@ ba@@ za , who was arrested in 2008 and was sentenced to 22 years in prison together with four other def@@ end@@ ants for the dis@@ integration of 54 million people ( around 800 000 Euros ) .
the money came from public funds from Moz@@ ambique &apos;s airports , the Council of Cam@@ ba@@ za , between 2005 and 2008 .
Cam@@ ba@@ za was released in 2016 because of good management and immediately called for his return to the company , which happened on April 19th .
in accordance with a statement by the At@@ tor@@ ney General of the Republic , who filed an application , there would be no obstacle to Cam@@ ba@@ za to resume his old post , since the company did not perform any disciplinary proceedings after his detention .
however , many inhabitants do not expect the action good .
the Centre for Public Integr@@ ity ( Centro de Integ@@ ri@@ da@@ de P@@ Ãº@@ bli@@ ca , C@@ IP ) , a local institution committed to public transparency , in an interview with Deutsche Welle den@@ ounced the company &apos;s decision to re @-@ establish the director :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; puts a set@@ back in the fight against corruption and highlights the lack of transparency and is even a step backward with regard to the efforts of our legal system , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; C@@ IP . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
what we take note is that the company should also initiate a disciplinary action against the contrary .
however , the company was silent and did not make any reasonable legal steps for the application of the corresponding functions .
Eg@@ Ã­@@ dio V@@ az , a significant voice in the Moz@@ ambi@@ can social media , also re@@ jects this behaviour and regards the case as &quot; foreign &quot; :
if Cam@@ ba@@ za was a competent guy , he would be a consultant after he was sentenced to a prison sentence and half of it had to eat .
he could give paid talks and motiv@@ ating speeches , he could advise and polish his image .
but since he is in@@ competent he cons@@ ented to be re@@ integrated into the company , which he helped to inflic@@ t damage .
consequently it is obvious : Cam@@ ba@@ za is gladly paid for his silence .
disgu@@ sting !
Bit@@ one Vi@@ age , young Moz@@ ambique and student of political science in Brazil , says the director had no moral :
Cam@@ ba@@ za is rewarded by the state because he insul@@ ted him . I can &apos;t believe that someone was rewarded in such a way that already insul@@ ted the state .
Cam@@ ba@@ za is missing to return to the state and to serve the state , * he had already had a unique opportunity to serve the state , but instead only served by the state itself .
Cam@@ ba@@ za used the state as though it was an in@@ exhaus@@ tible source of money and the state itself has become we@@ ary of this man who was sum@@ mon@@ ed and finally sentenced to a long prison sentence .
hon@@ estly , I don &apos;t know why this man was so rewarded .
Franc@@ ey Ze@@ Ãº@@ te pre@@ fers to remind the Prime Minister of Moz@@ ambique , Sam@@ ora Mach@@ el , to remember that a th@@ ief is in jail :
thi@@ eves are in prison Sam@@ ora Mach@@ el will not only remain in memory for the Moz@@ ambique as the first independent president , but also as a sharp , single @-@ ed@@ ged , and - by the way - proph@@ etic speakers .
one of his most famous oral represent@@ ations was when he affir@@ med vigor@@ ously that &quot; an ambitious man is capable of all , even the fa@@ ther@@ land for his ambi@@ tions to sell his own individual interest . &quot;
Sam@@ ora also said : &quot; I don &apos;t know if an ambitious man changes , my experience shows that this is not the case . he changes the tactics , but he does not turn away from his ambi@@ tions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; an ambitious man is also criminal . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in Twitter , the reactions were also negative :
Cam@@ ba@@ za was sentenced to 22 years in prison for 10 years and was free .
and today the company , in which he res@@ ig@@ ns money , is res@@ ig@@ ned again under contract . # As@@ sim@@ V@@ ai@@ OM@@ eu@@ Pa@@ is - blu@@ eg@@ r@@ ass ( @ az@@ mal _ Ra@@ fik ) May 12 , 2017

Facebook blocks the rac@@ ist word &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; in Myanmar and cens@@ ored many users
the Bur@@ m@@ ese word &quot; Kal@@ ar pa@@ e &quot; means chi@@ ck@@ pe@@ a or spl@@ itting .
photo by San@@ j@@ ay A@@ char@@ ya , Wikipedia Comm@@ ons , Creative Comm@@ ons Attri@@ bution @-@ Share A@@ like 3.0 Un@@ ported
according to information from Facebook users in Myanmar , the well @-@ known social network took their posts from the net because they contained the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; .
although it is still being discussed about the origin of the word , it is usually used to refer to people of Eastern India or generally used as an ad@@ j@@ ective &quot; Indian . &quot;
Facebook cens@@ uses the word &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; or , for the most part , to be part of an initiative to address the widespread problem of hate speech in Burma in the social network .
in recent years , the rise of radical nation@@ alist movements has given the word an extremely degra@@ ding con@@ notation .
in particular , it is a word commonly used by ultra @-@ nation@@ alists as hate speech against Muslims representing a minority of the population in Myanmar .
but in an effort to combat hate speech in Myanmar , the company has cens@@ ored a lot of meaningful content on its platform .
today &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; may normally be associated with rac@@ ism , but the word itself does not automatically ev@@ oke hate speech .
the context is important &amp; # 8@@ 212 ; many people have reported that even posts in which they have discussed the use of the word have been cens@@ ored in order to use the word .
in addition , there are several Bur@@ m@@ ese words with different mean@@ ings , which have the same sequence of letters as &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; .
for example , chair on Bur@@ m@@ eric is also written &apos; Kal@@ ar h@@ ta@@ ing &apos; , which contains the same letters as well as other words like &apos; Kal@@ ar pa@@ e &apos; , &apos; Kal@@ ar O@@ AT &apos; ( cam@@ el ) or &apos; kal@@ ark@@ aar &apos; ( curtain ) .
the Fac@@ eb@@ oo@@ b@@ utz@@ er A@@ ung Ka@@ ung My@@ at explained the different mean@@ ings of words with the sound of &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; :
a post of one of my friends was extingu@@ ished today because he contained the word Kal@@ ar .
however , he asked his friends in a wit@@ ty manner if they knew how to allevi@@ ate his back pain by making a pu@@ n game .
the ku la - &quot; healing &quot; ( ku ) + question word ( la ) on Bur@@ m@@ ese - resembles the rac@@ ist expression , but the context is completely different .
there were different reactions to the Facebook Initiative .
Z@@ in Win H@@ ats believes that it will reduce hate speech of radical nation@@ alists , but also stressed that Facebook needs to be more analytical before releasing all posts that are suspected of spreading rac@@ ism .
Facebook does not delete the word &quot; Kal@@ ar . &quot;
it filters the word automatically .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; automati@@ sm will not understand what you write on Fac@@ il@@ ook . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
what it should do instead is to carefully analyze the post and control it by checking the adjacent words .
for example , &quot; Kal@@ ar H@@ t@@ ine &quot; ( chair ) and &quot; Kal@@ ar pa@@ e &quot; ( spac@@ ers ) .
the good thing is that these dirty nation@@ alists who spread hate speech have received a fairly good lesson .
now it is time to circumc@@ ise its nation@@ alism .
while the action may send a strong signal to everyone who dis@@ semin@@ ates hate speech , the efficiency of this strategy may not last long .
the experiences of social networks in China like S@@ ina Wei@@ bo and We@@ Chat have shown that the cens@@ orship of keywords is often a cat and mouse game , whereby the users of social networks are simply starting to use a new word or alternative sp@@ elling of the cens@@ ored word to express their views .
the author A@@ ung Ka@@ ung My@@ at described how Facebook started to delete his posts when he only wanted to tell his friends that the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; was ban@@ ished by the social network :
... when I became aware of this new Facebook directive , I made a post to tell my Facebook friends that the word is locked .
iron@@ ically , my post was removed from Facebook and I was forbidden to read , post and share content for 24 hours , because the post was not consistent with the Facebook community standards . &quot;
Facebook has removed a variety of posts by people who have no negative intentions or simply try to show their opinions against the hate speech of radical nation@@ alists .
Patrick Mur@@ phy wrote that his post was removed , who has nothing to do with hate speech :
post without hate speech from Facebook .
in the post , the author informed his opinion of why extreme nation@@ alism and religious fundament@@ alism in the country are bad .
Ch@@ an My@@ ae Kh@@ ine believes that Facebook should have done more before the start of the initiative , for example the Bur@@ m@@ ese Internet community asking for advice :
Facebook might have a ben@@ evol@@ ent intention to l@@ essen rac@@ ism in Burma through its platform , but it does not work .
cens@@ oring such words will only bring more hatred within the different communities .
in addition , it seems as if they have started this without local context or technical support and have forbidden such words as &quot; chair &quot; or &quot; inherit@@ ence curr@@ y . &quot;
even when they found out that they made mistakes , they did not try to correct the deleted posts .
if they would only have a little more respect for the 15 million benefits that would give them a big turnover , that would be great .
Chrom@@ ebooks automatic cens@@ orship made a lot of ridi@@ cu@@ le among the users .
instead of taking it seriously , users now make fun on Facebook and consciously write the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; not in the context of hate speech to see if their posts are taken from the net .
here you can see some screen@@ shots of Facebook posts that didn &apos;t contain hate speech but were still removed :
used with permission .
the Bur@@ m@@ ese text reads &quot; I want to sit on a chair and eat pe@@ as curr@@ y and watch an Indian film .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; just to try out whether Facebook removes the post containing the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
screen@@ shot , used with permission .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the post states &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; If you are a doctor , then heal people ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
screen@@ shot , used with permission .
over the past five years extreme nation@@ alist ide@@ ologies and religious fundament@@ alists who have used social networks to expand their voices and influence have increased .
among other things , hate speech in social networks should additionally heat up violence in the communities in Myanmar , especially in the area of Rak@@ h@@ ine , where confron@@ tations between Muslims and Budd@@ hi@@ sts have forced thousands to flee .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Facebook was critici@@ zed for its failure to bring out the balancing hate speech on its Bur@@ m@@ ese sides . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but instead of cens@@ oring the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; it would have been better to look at the context rather than to concentrate on code and learn from them .
Trinidad &amp; # 0@@ 38 ; Tob@@ ago conclu@@ des with the children &apos;s marriage
a wedding ring in the sand .

the breeze is now illegal in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago .
on 9 June 2017 , the Parliament of the country unanim@@ ously decided on a law to ban this practice , so that the age @-@ compatible age is now at 18 .
before this change of marriage , some members of Hin@@ du and Muslim religious communities adher@@ ed to the practice , and in May 2016 , Brother Har@@ ry@@ per@@ sad Mahar@@ aj , the leader of the Inter@@ religious Organization ( I@@ RO ) , a group representing representatives of the various religious groups of the country , said that the state should not interfere since that , age is not the maturity . &quot;
this has been done not@@ withstanding the fact that Trinidad and Tob@@ ago are a contracting partner of the UN Children &apos;s Rights Convention , the min@@ ors as defined , each person under the age of 18 . &quot;
statistics of the UN for the years 2002 @-@ 2012 show that the proportion of children already married to 15 in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago was 2.8 percent , and at 18 it was 8.1 percent .
in 2011 , the Federal Statisti@@ cal Office of the country confirmed that more than 8@@ 400 girls and 1,@@ 300 boys were married under 19 .
online peti@@ tions and social media movements , which tried to aboli@@ sh laws for the children &apos;s marriage , followed at the foot and enjoyed great support . undoubtedly they helped to bring about that result .
nevertheless , everything went smoothly .
a Hin@@ du guide , for example , had no qual@@ ms about telling the critics of the children , they were to take care of their own affairs . &quot;
this sort of religious opposition created tensions in this rather un@@ complicated affair , and at some point doubts came up whether the opposition would agree with the bill at all .
but at the beginning of 2017 the bill was adopted against the children before - despite 4 sen@@ ators ( among them a woman ) of the opposition and an independent , which contained - so that he could be discussed in the House of Repres@@ ent@@ atives , where a simple majority would make him the law .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now only the president of the country must agree and declare the law . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
one of the Sen@@ ators of the country gave on Facebook a status update which Les@@ lie @-@ An@@ n Bo@@ is@@ elle posted on Inst@@ agra@@ m again :
Mr. Sen@@ ator Clar@@ ence Ram@@ b@@ har@@ at : the bill against the children &apos;s marriage was voted in the House of Repres@@ ent@@ atives with 35 votes and none of them decided against it .
having previously been approved in the Senate , the draft can now become a law .
the majority of social media users were thri@@ lled because the laws for children were finally changed .
member of the Facebook member Lov@@ ell Francis , who is a minister of ministers in the Ministry of Education , said :
it has taken too much time and unnecessary talk , which has disgu@@ ised the heart of the matter , but do you know what ? the breeze is now illegal in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago , and that is well worth every price .
while Abel Jackson thought it was definitely long enough to aboli@@ sh the practice , L@@ ara Qu@@ entr@@ all @-@ Thomas was over@@ jo@@ yed that the day finally came :
public Status Update on Facebook from L@@ ara Qu@@ entr@@ al@@ - Thomas , which says : , , Excell@@ ent news !
the law of marriage has been decided .
minimum age - 18 , Vo@@ ices - 35 for it - 0 against it ! ! ! ! &quot;
Tor@@ ade Mut@@ ota , which belongs to the Women &apos;s Institute for Alternative Development ( WI@@ NA@@ D ) , a civil society group that openly discussed how important the adoption of the law was :
the marriage @-@ capable age in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago is now independent of the religious affili@@ ation 18 years .
the draft for the modification of the marriage network was decided today , on 9 June 2017 .
there are 41 MPs in the House of Repres@@ ent@@ atives and 35 of them were present in the voting .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all the de@@ pu@@ ties that were present have voted for the law . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the children &apos;s marriage is not permitted by law in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago .
it was a long fight ( ... ) # child@@ bearing shield .
many thanks to all the activists who challenged him .
congratulations .
a thank you to our de@@ pu@@ ties .
but a possible catch comes in the shape of Sat Mahar@@ aj , Secretary General of the San@@ atan D@@ har@@ ma Mah@@ a Sab@@ ha , the most famous Hin@@ du organisation in the country .
months ago , Mahar@@ aj has announced his intention to undertake judicial steps , the law should be passed , and he seems to redeem his promise now .
while the At@@ tor@@ ney General Paris Al ra@@ wi , a pro@@ pon@@ ent of the law , thought it was quite legitimate if Mahar@@ aj wanted to go against the law , most social media users wished that the debate on the subject would be different .
Patricia Vor@@ rel@@ l suggested :
dear Sat , if we , instead of discussing the discussion , in a way that can only provoke panic and dis@@ grace , instead of talking about the problem that the state , our daughters in front of protecting them from being mis@@ used by large , hard @-@ boiled men who are in front of them , would be ready to continue the discussion ?
or do you think it &apos;s not a problem ?
however , whether it comes to judicial proceedings against the law or not , this legislation is an important step - but there are still places in the world where the children are legally or still the norm in different gra@@ dations , even though there are laws that they prohi@@ bit .

on the eve of the national demonstrations against corruption , which coinci@@ ded with Russia &apos;s day - the Russian national holiday - the website of the Prosecutor of the district Y@@ ar@@ osla@@ v@@ l was h@@ ack@@ ed . the h@@ ack@@ ers left a wit@@ ty message &quot; Rem@@ aining home .

on Sunday morning , the Office of the Prosecutor announced the local news service Y@@ ar@@ News that they were h@@ ack@@ ed .
by mirr@@ oring web pages Turkish users can view Wikipedia content
the Wikipedia page was published on January 18 , 2012 , contrary to the SO@@ PA ( Stop Online Privacy Act ) and P@@ IP@@ A copyright legislation in the United States , internationally dark@@ ened .
created by Wikipedia ( CC B@@ Y @-@ SA 3.0 )
for more than a month , Turkey has been blocking the popular and crow@@ d@@ sourcing principle based on en@@ cyclo@@ pedia of Wikipedia .
day after day , it becomes clear how important the platform is for users to find and share helpful and reliable information .
both students and repor@@ ters and fans of TV series are fighting against the block@@ age .
although many technology @-@ sav@@ vy Internet users are used to use b@@ yp@@ assing tools for blocked websites ( a recent article from the New York Times reports that Turkey has the third largest VPN pre@@ val@@ ence in the world ) , most of the ordinary Wikipedia users do not fall into this category .
although Turkey has been blocking Article from Wikipedia since 2008 , as recently posted in a published report by the Ber@@ k@@ man Klein Center for Internet &amp; amp ; Society at Harvard University , regular block@@ ages of the Internet have been adopted since 2007 after the Internet Act ( No. 56@@ 51 ) was adopted .
according to China , Turkey is the second most famous country in the world when it comes to massive cens@@ orship from Wikipedia .
while the platform remains locked , several mirror sites ( sites that reflect the content of Wikipedia and are frequently updated ) are now di@@ pped .
a solution came from IP@@ FS ( the Inter@@ Plan@@ etary File System ) , when the platform deposited all Turkish Wikipedia pages on its dedicated pe@@ er @-@ to @-@ pe@@ er network ( so host computer connections ) , which does not support the system of domain names and thus makes a complete cens@@ orship difficult .
however , the content is available in spite of the legal ban .
in a blog post , IP@@ FS reports about its efforts :
after we heard the news ( about the block from Wikipedia ) , we set out everything to take snap@@ shots of Wikipedia on the IP@@ FS platform . thus , the possibility exists to read the content on decentr@@ alized and distributed ways .
this can help users view at least all Wikipedia content , even if they cannot reach the website www.@@ wi@@ ki@@ pedi@@ a.@@ org themselves .
IP@@ FS also stated that this step was done independently of the Wi@@ k@@ im@@ edi@@ a Foundation , and it is merely screen@@ shots and no live or dynamic versions of the website .
however , Wi@@ k@@ im@@ edi@@ a was involved in other efforts to circum@@ vent the lock .
Cris@@ tian Con@@ son@@ ni of Wi@@ k@@ im@@ edi@@ a Italy has produced both tr@@ .@@ vi@@ ki@@ an@@ si@@ klo@@ pedia , a M@@ irr@@ or@@ page from Wikipedia , as well as Wiki@@ Mir@@ ror , an open source project that anyone can use to host similar irr@@ ors pages when locked in the respective country Wikipedia .
Con@@ son@@ ni reported Sub@@ h@@ ash@@ ish Pan@@ ig@@ ra@@ hi - Global Vo@@ ices members as well as collabor@@ ators at the Pan@@ ig@@ ra@@ hi &apos;s Open Spe@@ aks &quot; Pod@@ cast :
it is not a complete copy of a proxy address , a mirror .
one acc@@ esses another URL that is not the original . that what you see then is from Wikipedia .
essentially , the server direc@@ ts the request to the correct Wikipedia page , so it is possible to see the contents of Wikipedia itself if they are locked in Turkey .
for this is executed by a server that is not in Turkey .
a Nep@@ al@@ ese wildlife photographer uses his camera to draw attention to the need for natural protection
a su@@ c@@ cul@@ ent r@@ hin@@ oc@@ eros , Ch@@ it@@ wan .
photo by Sag@@ ar Gir@@ i .
used with permission .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sag@@ ar Gir@@ i was never satisfied with the photos he saw around him . they were blur@@ ry with badly positioned motifs and washed colors . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this motivated him to take a camera and try to strai@@ gh@@ ten the situation .
back then he was a child .
today , at the age of 28 , Sag@@ ar tries to bring N@@ ept@@ une &apos;s wildlife to the international stage .
and his hom@@ etown right next to the Ch@@ it@@ wan National Park , offers him the perfect opportunity to take photographs that draw attention to Nepal &apos;s wildlife .
he described on Facebook how this prime location helps him in his work :
I live at the edge of Ch@@ it@@ wan National Park , a world natural heritage . what could be better for a passionate wildlife photographer ! !
I was right at home when suddenly Navar@@ aj ( the manager of the Ch@@ it@@ wan G@@ aida Lodge ) suddenly invited me . he had received a phone call from my father that a le@@ op@@ ard on the banks of the Rap@@ ti river would be a le@@ op@@ ard .
the dam is only a few minutes away from the tourist resort of Sau@@ ra@@ ha .
immediately I ran away with my camera and was there in a few minutes .
my father had watched him and showed me the place on the other river side , where the le@@ op@@ ard found himself and I immediately started to make pictures ! !
Sag@@ ar seeks cooperation with the authorities in order to obtain worldwide recognition for N@@ ept@@ une &apos;s nature and would like to deep@@ en the understanding that wild animals are not as frigh@@ tening as they look .
and he should know it , for he was standing by face to tig@@ ers face to face , saying ,
a tiger is not disturbed by the opinion of the sheep while sleeping ! !
late in the evening . the light is too weak .
sleeping time for all animals and birds .
also I was on the way home because of the darkness , when suddenly the king of the bus appeared . he immediately sets off , we see us and he star@@ es through the sc@@ arf @-@ trees ! !
to promote the protection of wild animals Sag@@ ar places the logo &quot; I click for rest &quot; ( lit . : I click for environmental protection ) on its photos .
however , his passion for the promotion of Nep@@ al@@ ese nature and wildlife is not always easy .
he waited for 22 days , and usually lived in a tent in order to make recordings of Ot@@ ters in the Bar@@ dia National Park . up to 12 days it took until he was able to photograph a tiger and six to seven days for the perfect photo of birds that live near the tourist accommodation .

years after the wedding , Indian women dare to pron@@ ounce the name of their hus@@ bands for the first time
women in the small Indian village Gum@@ la J@@ am Gay@@ i in Jh@@ ark@@ hand .

this entry was written by Kay@@ on@@ a@@ az K@@ aly@@ an@@ wal@@ a and was originally published on video Vol@@ un@@ te@@ ers , an award @-@ winning international media organisation from India .
a revised version was re @-@ published as part of a content sharing agreement .
in many parts of India , women have the greatest care to pron@@ ounce the name of their hus@@ bands or even older men in the family .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; instead , they use a pron@@ ou@@ n or say &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; father of my child . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
from Ch@@ hat@@ tis@@ gar@@ h to Mahar@@ ash@@ tra and U@@ t@@ tar Pra@@ des@@ h , women admit that due to the social pressure they respect the husband , as well as fear of the consequences they should dis@@ regard the norm , maintain this practice alive .
last year , Mal@@ ati Mah@@ at@@ oto from the Indian state of O@@ dish@@ a was convic@@ ted by a false tri@@ bunal and exp@@ elled from her family and the village community after having addressed a married family with a name .
the tradition of nam@@ ing their wives by name is also common among men . however , they have far fewer grants to fear , if at all those , they should not follow this practice .
in the small village of Wal@@ he in the district of P@@ une , in Mahar@@ ash@@ tra , nine women , including health personnel as well as house@@ wives , joined a unique club and became the main topic of the city &apos;s main topic .
it is a place only for them to discuss and discuss the intri@@ c@@ acies of the patri@@ archy .
as one of 56 clubs , which exists in 13 Indian states , he is part of the # K@@ hero Bad@@ al campaign , which is operated by the Video Vol@@ un@@ te@@ ers community and advoc@@ ates for the mining of the patri@@ archy .
Roh@@ ini Pa@@ was has been working for seven years with the help of her video camera to expose practices , such as children &apos;s marriage up to the exile of HIV and AIDS victims , and manages these clubs .
it reports how these clubs created a safe place for these women and at the same time made them ambass@@ adors of change .
the first video that Roh@@ ini showed in her discussion round acted by women who don &apos;t call her hus@@ bands name .
she decided on this subject because she wanted to open the conversation about the patri@@ archy with a problem with which the women can easily identify .
not to pron@@ ounce the name of her hus@@ bands is a custom that they all perpet@@ u@@ ate and never questioned .
Roh@@ ini saying :
this tradition testi@@ fies that a woman respects her husband and wishes him a long life .
a woman who does not stop this is considered as a dec@@ eit@@ ful woman , as a woman without mor@@ als .
tradition is so deeply rooted that we have never thought of this until this round of discussion .
at the beginning , Roh@@ ini , who had never called her husband by name , wanted to try out at home , as it goes .
she showed the video of the discussion round her husband and her mother @-@ in @-@ law .
Roh@@ ini told :
my mother @-@ in @-@ law and my husband remained silent for a long time after the video ended .
Prak@@ ash , my husband , turned to me and said I should call him from now on with his name .
with this confidence in the luggage , Roh@@ ini started their first discussion club .
many women had never heard the word &quot; patri@@ archy &quot; before . some believed it was a good thing , because it meant that younger members of a family , especially girls and women , would be protected .
at the beginning of the round , Roh@@ ini showed a video about the problem in U@@ t@@ tar Pra@@ des@@ h .
after the video projection , the women tried to start the discussion with an exercise .
Roh@@ ini asked every participant to say the name of her husband with different feelings - happy , angry , sad , loving and so on .
then she asked all , &quot; If we can &apos;t tell the name of our hus@@ bands , but they can call us as they want , does that mean that they don &apos;t respect us ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; should it not be equivalent ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; some of these women have been married for 30 years and this was the first day they brought the name of their hus@@ bands on their lips , &quot; says Roh@@ ini Pa@@ z from Wal@@ he village in Mahar@@ ash@@ tra about breaking a secular tradition in which married women can never pron@@ ounce the name of their hus@@ bands .
Roh@@ ini told :
a woman was so frigh@@ tened that during the whole exercise she only sne@@ aked in front of him ; another decided to let the whole accumulated fru@@ stration come out against him and his family by cur@@ bing him .
the expression on their faces was ec@@ static .
I think I &apos;ll never forget it again .
even in the rush of adren@@ alin to have broken with an ancient tradition , the women decided that they would actually try to call their hus@@ bands at home .
and they kept their word .
in the next few days , Roh@@ ini received a ple@@ th@@ ora of reports .
the husband of a woman called Roh@@ ini and asked what ideas she put in her head : his wife couldn &apos;t stop saying his name .
another club member decided to do it at dinner in front of the entire family .
when her mother @-@ in @-@ law star@@ ed her , she was afraid and said it was a mistake .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; another woman said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Roh@@ ini said I should do it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a husband of a participant was less understanding and the situation developed into force .
Roh@@ ini reports how women have tried to stop other practices , such as wearing the in@@ ox red dot on the forehead , which indicates the sp@@ ouses :
why do women only need to show that they are married ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I said to my husband that I would carry the interest @-@ red dot if he did it too . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he laugh@@ ed only and I stopped wearing him .
the other women have not stopped completely , but think they are now in a better position to choose themselves , not to wear it on some days .
for many women , the discussion club is a safe place where they can share their opinions and goals .
&quot; we make a trip at every discussion club .
we normally pack lunch and water and go out into the field .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t want women to worry about who could hear what &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the last months they celebrated their own birth@@ days with cakes for the first time in their lives . they d@@ anced and sang and talked about things they had never thought before .
Roh@@ ini saying :
I have been working on these problems for so many years and yet I have never talked so hon@@ estly about some things , for example how our identi@@ ties are tied to our hus@@ bands .
it feels great to be able to say certain things out loud , no matter how small they occur .
in a discussion round , we talked about the concept of honor and how it is connected to clothes .
some women in the group have borne only Sar@@ is since their marriage .
for most people this is okay , but some wanted a sal@@ ty @-@ Kur@@ ta , a wide shirt over a trousers , they didn &apos;t dare .
after a lot of argument and discussion about the advantages of their own fashion choice , the mor@@ als combined with the sar@@ is and much more , Roh@@ ini sne@@ aked up their own pair of Kur@@ tas ( Ober@@ hem@@ den ) into a discussion round , so that the women could wear them .
next they decided to plan a trip to Go@@ a where they can wear je@@ ans and Roh@@ ini is sure they will manage it .
on the question of whether something has changed in the five months since its first discussion club , Roh@@ ini confirmed that things are slowly rolling :
so far we have only done small steps .
some women tried it a few times , but then stopped to say the name of her husband .
some , including me , do it yet , but only if they are alone and there are no other family members .
only one or two women continue to say the name of their hus@@ bands ; only one or two women now wear Zin@@ no@@ ber@@ rot on their foreh@@ e@@ ads every time .
the women in the discussion club know that the changes they want to achieve in their lives - like the h@@ amm@@ ers for more freedom of movement or their own choice of clothes - lie at the end of a heavily navig@@ ating river .
by giving each other self @-@ confidence , they are aware that they are sitting in the same boat .
how Roh@@ ini declares :
each of us is a victim of the patri@@ archy .
I am also .
but this club gives each of us the confidence that something will change .
and I know that it is not only limited to 30 families . there will be a chain reaction when every woman goes home in the club and tells other people about what we are talking about and what we are doing .
we all sit in the same boat .
the correspon@@ dents of the video Vol@@ un@@ te@@ ers community come from margin@@ alized groups in India and make videos about stories that are not reported .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these stories are &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; messages from those who experience them themselves , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and offer a hyper@@ local context to report global human rights and development challenges . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the first Japan visit to the popular band The Beat@@ les is celebrated with a memorial day
the Beat@@ les at their landing in Japan .
screen@@ shot from the official YouTube channel of the Beat@@ les .
on the 29th of June this year , the h@@ ash@@ tag was to be used to find the way to the Japanese Twitter trend , where many fans exchanged memories and shared their appreciation for the Beat@@ les .
the visit of the Beat@@ les in 1966 in Japan is regarded as a revers@@ al in the Japanese culture of the post @-@ war period .
the first Japanese journalist , Hos@@ hi@@ ka Rum@@ i@@ ko , who inter@@ viewed the Beat@@ les 1964 in London , noted in 2016 on the occasion of the 50@@ th anniversary of his first visit :
for just under five days the Beat@@ les were in the country , but this was enough to let the Japanese go through .
it became clear to the people here that they had no choice but to receive the Beat@@ les with open arms .
many well @-@ known Japanese sizes had reached its zen@@ ith when the Beat@@ les came to Japan for the first time in 1966 .
the music of the cult band is &quot; more than just a universal language like English , &quot; said Ry@@ u@@ ich@@ i Is@@ aka , President of the retail giant Seven &amp; amp ; i Hol@@ dings , the online magazine Nik@@ k@@ ei Asian Review .
good morning ! today is the Beat@@ les memorial day in Japan .
even today , songs from the Beat@@ les are sung in Japanese kar@@ a@@ oke bars and in English classes at Japanese middle schools .
the kit@@ sch of the Beat@@ les survi@@ ves everything .
today is Beat@@ les Day of Rem@@ em@@ bran@@ ce .
we all love the Beat@@ les in our house .
I don &apos;t know if this &quot; W@@ inn@@ ie the P@@ oo@@ h &quot; doll should represent John L@@ enn@@ on or not .
and as it is for fans , Japanese naturally make pilgri@@ ma@@ ges to the known places that are related to the band .
if you love the Beat@@ les , these are your 5 places that you absolutely have to visit .
1 ) Abbey Road
2 ) Math@@ ew Street ( in Liverpool )
3 ) Stra@@ w@@ berry Fields ( memorial in New York )
4 ) P@@ enny Lan@@ e
5 ) ( From the link ) The Beat@@ les Story ( Museum ) , Liverpool
the pilgri@@ ma@@ ges can sometimes not be whi@@ m@@ si@@ cal enough :
good morning together .
today is Beat@@ les Day of Rem@@ em@@ bran@@ ce .
exactly today in 1966 , the Beat@@ les came to Japan for the first time .
the characters from the movie K @-@ On ! went on a pilgrimage to London and ran over Abbey Road .
the same thing we did last year .
and of course , some companies also use the fan community in terms of market terms , such as these R@@ amen @-@ Shop ( R@@ amen are Japanese no@@ od@@ les ) in Tokyo .
good morning , here is Mut@@ a@@ hi@@ ro Ko@@ ya R@@ amen ! today is Beat@@ les memorial day .
and what could this be for a day ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today I will listen to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Y@@ ester@@ day &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and I will eat R@@ amen no@@ od@@ les in Ko@@ ya . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is how the day will run today .
so , we hope you are there !

bald men are ab@@ duc@@ ted and killed in Moz@@ ambique
the police of Zam@@ b@@ Ã©@@ zia warned the population that men @-@ headed men could be attacks in Moz@@ ambique .

a new system of kidn@@ apping people for organ trading , presumably for super@@ sti@@ tious purposes , al@@ armed the police of Zam@@ b@@ Ã©@@ zia , a province in Moz@@ ambique . the local government now called for a number of operations to stop the practice .
at the beginning of the month three men were killed in the district of Mil@@ ange , a few kilometers from the border to Malawi .
one of the victims was found be@@ headed and a part of the organs were removed .
two men were arrested and subsequently admitted that the organs of sham@@ ans in Tanzania and Malawi have been used .
according to the local super@@ sti@@ tion that the head of a man @-@ headed man could reveal gold or bring wealth , the police officer of Zam@@ b@@ Ã©@@ zia declared the BBC .
it is the first time that successive attacks on bald men were registered in Moz@@ ambique .
another group , the goal of assass@@ inations for obsc@@ ure purposes , are people with al@@ bin@@ ism .
this led to the fact that the UN in 2016 conducted a mission in the South African country to investigate this practice .
the persecution of people with al@@ bin@@ ism is common in other countries of southern Africa , especially in the neighbouring country of Tanzania , where the government developed campaigns to fight this super@@ sti@@ tion and prejudi@@ ce .
U@@ kom@@ be We@@ ya lives in the city of Map@@ u@@ to .
he warned those who are planning to travel to the country :
be@@ ware of k@@ ah@@ le men who travel to Moz@@ ambique to travel to Moz@@ ambique are target of ritual attacks , warned the Moz@@ ambi@@ can police following the latest kill@@ ings of three men @-@ faced men due to their body parts .
two susp@@ ects were arrested in the district of Mil@@ ange , where the kill@@ ings took place .
Hus@@ band Al@@ gy Adam@@ o , student and resident of the city of In@@ ham@@ ban@@ e in the south of Moz@@ ambique , said that the local police have already followed the case :
PR@@ M believes that the sham@@ ans are involved in the death of the bald men .
the persecution and murder of bald individuals for the extraction and sale of their organs in the district of Mor@@ rum@@ bal@@ a , province of Zam@@ b@@ Ã©@@ zia , has commissioned cultural motives and is commissioned by the traditional sham@@ ans , which also acknowled@@ ges that a belief does exist according to which the victims in the head had power to generate the riches .
in the last days three men were murdered in this part of the country with hair loss problems .
Angela F@@ errei@@ ra Sam@@ anth@@ a shared on Facebook the chron@@ ic@@ le of the B@@ log@@ gers poor Sn@@ ai@@ ppa , who pointed out that the problem is part of the greater social difficulty facing Moz@@ ambique :
I M@@ Ã@@ CH@@ TE GER@@ MA@@ NY BE@@ ING Moz@@ ambique , THE S@@ ME is ashamed of a country in which people would be ashamed to have sex against good grades and do not hurt others or even take their lives to earn their bread , a country in which neither the al@@ bin@@ os nor bald or bald @-@ headed for super@@ sti@@ tious purposes or &quot; black magic &quot; are hun@@ ted .
despite the seri@@ ousness of the phenomenon , some of the opportunities for mac@@ ab@@ re humor could not be missed .
Zen@@ aida Mach@@ ado , scientist of Human Rights Watch for Angola and Moz@@ ambique and avi@@ d Twitter users , twe@@ et@@ ets that both the boss of the district Mor@@ rum@@ bal@@ a , Pedro Sap@@ ange , as well as the police spokes@@ man Zam@@ b@@ Ã©@@ zi@@ as , In@@ Ã¡@@ cio D@@ ina , both are bald :
Moz@@ ambi@@ can authorities are very concerned about the murder of the people of the world .

we are deeply affected by the death of our friend Bass@@ el K@@ hart@@ ab@@ il .
we mo@@ urn for him and speak our deeply felt con@@ dol@@ ences to his family , friends and all those who knew and loved him .
a pioneer of Creative Comm@@ ons in Syria , active in projects such as Mozilla Firefox and Wikipedia , Bass@@ el K@@ hart@@ ab@@ il ( also known as Bass@@ el Saf@@ adi ) played a key role in expanding access to the Internet and open knowledge .
he was a close friend of many of the Global Vo@@ ices community and participated in our meeting of Arab blo@@ ggers in 2009 .
in November 2015 , Bas@@ le &apos;s wife N@@ our@@ a G@@ haz@@ i reported that she was contacted by people who were spending themselves as inside the Assad government .
they reported that their husband was sentenced to death , but gave no further information .
Bas@@ lan &apos;s stay and Constitution was still unknown until today ( 01 August 2017 ) , when N@@ our@@ a heard of Syrian officials that he was executed in 2015 .
today and in the future , Bass@@ el &apos;s work as a pioneer of the Open Web @-@ Movement prove to be the honor .
and we appreciate the efforts of all the individuals and organizations that have been working for their release over the past five years .
since 2011 and the beginning of protests against the regime of Bas@@ har al @-@ Assad , more than 65@@ ,000 people have disappeared , such as the organization of the Syrian Network for Human Rights .
countless of those arrested or forci@@ bly disappeared by the regime are subjected to torture and even exec@@ utions .
between 2011 and 2016 , no fewer than 17,@@ 7@@ 23 Syrians have been put to death , the international human rights organisation Am@@ ne@@ sty International .
the fate of many people remains unknown .

this story was originally published on July 8 , 2017 at Hong Kong Free Press .
the following version will be published as part of a partnership agreement via Global Vo@@ ices .
the case of the imprisoned Chinese dissi@@ dent Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o attracted attention in the international community after his lawyer had announced at the end of June that he was hospit@@ alized for liver cancer in the end stage .
in 2009 , Li@@ u was sentenced to 11 years imprisonment for &quot; Subversion &quot; ( state risk ) after having participated in the draft of the Charter 08 , a manifest@@ o that demanded democratic reforms in China .
he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for his work in 2010 .
the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in China referred to Li@@ us case as &quot; an internal matter &quot; and told a spokes@@ man that he considered it &quot; not necessary to discuss this matter with any other country . &quot;
nevertheless , China continues to uph@@ old calls from the international community , the Nobel Prize winner and his wife , poet Li@@ u X@@ ia , or to allow him to be treated abroad .
while some countries have critici@@ zed the strict treatment of the couple in Beijing , others have completely wi@@ ped out the subject .
Hong Kong Free Press has summar@@ ised some reactions abroad .
United Nations
Zei@@ d R@@ a @-@ ad al @-@ Hussein , United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights , met Chinese officials at the end of June in order to discuss the case of Li@@ u .
however , a spokes@@ man refused to comment on whether the United Nations should exercise pressure to allow Li@@ u abroad treatment .
Norway in Norway
Norway &apos;s Prime Minister Er@@ na Sol@@ berg and Foreign Minister B@@ Ã¸r@@ ge Br@@ ende had refused to answer questions about Li@@ us release .
the relationship between China and Norway was st@@ alled after the Nobel Peace Prize 2010 was con@@ ferred to Li@@ u , although the Norwegian government announced that this was ultimately nothing to do with the decision .
diplomatic relations were resum@@ ed in December last year . only in June Norway signed an agreement to resume salmon exports to China , as exports were largely blocked since 2010 .
after the news spread that Li@@ u was seriously ill , the Nobel Committee expressed his hope of unconditional release and invited Li@@ u to pick up his prize in Oslo .
due to his imprisonment , he was unable to accept his prize .
during the ceremony , Li@@ u was represented by an empty chair .
European Union The European Union
on 6 July , the European Parliament adopted a decision in which China was urged to free Li@@ u and his wife from house arrest and allow him to seek medical support wherever he wants .
the top diplom@@ at of the EU , Feder@@ ica Mo@@ gher@@ ini , also urged China to release Li@@ us as she announced in an explanation on June 30 :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the same time , we expect China to raise all restrictions of Mr. Li@@ us &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wife and family members . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they should meet and receive all the visits they desire , and be able to communicate freely with the outside world .
United States of America
U.S. Ambassador Ter@@ ry Bran@@ stad told us that the Americans would like &quot; him to have the opportunity to treat abroad , in so far as he can help him with his recovery . &quot;
a spokes@@ woman for the US embassy in China , Mary Beth Pol@@ ley , announced the news agency AF@@ P on June 27 that the message urged Chinese authorities not only to release Li@@ u , but to free his wife Li@@ u X@@ ia from their house arrest .
the US embassy sum@@ mon@@ ed a fur@@ ious response from China , with the out@@ ward appearance of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs , that &quot; no country has the right to interfere and to comment on Chinese internal affairs . &quot;
Pol@@ ley told that China should offer the couple the following :
protection and freedom such as freedom of travel and access to the medical care of his choice , to which they are entitled according to the Chinese Constitution and the legal system and international obligations .
the U.S. Sen@@ ators Marco Ru@@ bio , Jeff Merk@@ ley and T@@ ed Cruz have also introduced a resolution in Congress to push the Chinese government to release Li@@ u and his wife un@@ condition@@ ally .

the German spokesperson , Steffen Sei@@ bert , wrote on July 3 , Berlin , hope that Li@@ u will receive all the medical support he needs and that a humanitarian solution for Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o should be the highest priority . &quot;
Chinese President X@@ i J@@ in@@ ping appeared on July 7 and 8 at the G@@ 20 summit in Hamburg .
previously reported diplomatic sources in Beijing &apos;s news agency Reu@@ ters reported that China had great concerns about whether the vor@@ tex around Li@@ u could over@@ shadow the visit to Hamburg .
Canada - Canada
on 28 June , the Canadian ambassador John Mc@@ Call@@ um called on China to provide Li@@ u with appropriate medical care and give him the opportunity to take care of his family .
Li@@ us Adv@@ oc@@ ate told AF@@ P earlier that Li@@ u &apos;s wife , Li@@ u X@@ ia , could visit him every day , but the police always monitored the room in the hospital and that it is not allowed to speak and contact with someone outside , including his lawyers .
Mc@@ Call@@ um continues to tell :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Canada calls on China to uph@@ old its international human rights obligations , including freedom of speech , and to release those locked up for the exercise of these rights . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
France - France
France &apos;s foreign ministry called on China to release Li@@ u for humanitarian reasons in an explanation on 29 June :
all necessary measures must be taken to ensure that Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o receives all the treatments he needs , regardless of where . furthermore , his wife and family shall have contact with him .
although the news channel France Info already reported that the French government would welcome Li@@ u in the country , the Ministry of Foreign Affairs announced that there is no further information whether France will eventually receive it .
Taiwan - Taiwan
the Council of land@@ lords in Taiwan urged China on 27 June to release Li@@ u and show greater tolerance to those who use peaceful means to demand political reforms and democratic development .
the Tai@@ wan@@ ese law@@ makers Yu M@@ ei @-@ n@@ u of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party also called on China to allow the sick intellectual Li@@ u to be treated in Taiwan .
Dalai Lama - The Dalai Lama
the spiritual leader in Tibet , the Dalai Lama , was very concerned in an explanation on 28 June around Li@@ u and admitted that many asked him to pray for Li@@ u wellbeing .
he said about Li@@ u :
it is my belief that the initiatives he took and for which he was strictly punished had led to a more harmonious , more stable and prosper@@ ous China , which in turn would have contributed to a more peaceful world .
I personally felt very moved and also encouraged when I saw that hundreds of Chinese intellec@@ tuals and affected citizens , inspired by Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o , signed the Charter 08 , which stands for democracy , freedom and rule of law in China .
Singapore : city or country ?
Singapore .

is Singapore a city or country ?
the question may seem stupid as Singapore is recognised as an independent state on an international level .
but according to the Minister of Justice K. Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam , Singapore was supposed to be regarded as a city .
this re@@ mark has triggered a debate in the blo@@ g@@ osphere .
during the meeting of the international branch of the Bar Association of the State of New York , the Minister noted that many people critici@@ zed the domin@@ ance of the only political party in Singapore because they compared Singapore to other countries .
he supports Singapore as a city .
... no one has questioned whether New York is a democracy ...
this is what most people commit a mistake .
I have tried to explain that we are different .
we are a city .
we are not a country .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the blog Cav@@ ali@@ eri@@ o accused the Minister of Justice to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; turn logic &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to defend the existing author@@ itarian exercise of power in Singapore . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and then , after all our efforts and sacrifices to create this precious land , one hears that we are ultimately not a country .
it sounded so vul@@ gar , it had the appearance of an escape from the responsibilities , a breach of duty .
Singapore , if you &apos;re not my country , whose land is it then ?
the reasons cited by Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam were not very no@@ bel : he defended an idea , according to which one could not measure the political system of Singapore with other &apos; normal countries &apos; , in view of that , it seemed in@@ vari@@ ably un@@ democratic .
on the other hand , he has defended the idea that Singapore should be compared with cities like Chicago , San Francisco or New York , equally cities which are permanently led by a party .
these cities are democratic .
once one reaches the core point of the subject , the good old Ly@@ re pop@@ s up from the author@@ itarian rulers to be democr@@ ats , leave the distorted logic , since it fits better to their power .
in the end , the answers given in the last week of Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam were answers to his American guests regarding our press , our ju@@ dic@@ ative , our political system really non @-@ answers .
he cam@@ ou@@ fl@@ aged corresponding questions with non @-@ answers in a rational manner .
Rachel Z@@ eng calls on Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam to clarify his opinion , since she did not understand this conclusion .
personally , I find it a bit difficult to swal@@ low .
if Singapore is not a country but a city , so to which country belongs our city ...
in short , I don &apos;t understand anything .
I would be very grateful if our dear K Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam would take the effort to clarify this point , as long as he was highly paid to be part of the government of the city of Singapore .
by publishing his comment on the blog , he points to the critics that you should start reading the whole tran@@ script of the conference so that you can better understand the context of Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam &apos;s statements , according to which Singapore is a city and not a country .
read the tran@@ script .
when he said that Singapore was rather a &quot; city &quot; than a country , &quot; he explained why the elections in Singapore are so un@@ important even if we enjoy free and fair elections .
he compared Singapore to cities in the USA ( and how many of these cities saw a party for decades ? ) .
when he said that Singapore is not a country , &quot; he obviously did not mean it in this sense !
Cl@@ ement T@@ an shows his dis@@ appointment about Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam , the leader of a growing generation who makes such a pol@@ em@@ ical statement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am very embarrass@@ ed about what the Minister of Justice has said about Singapore . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at least I knew with Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew and the members of the old guard what I expected - whether I agree with them or not , but that &apos;s another thing .
but with K. Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam , member of the new generation of the political leaders of Singapore , I have doubts and I am not even sure if he really believes it is properly associated and is aware of what he is defending .
the TE@@ MA@@ SE@@ K Review de@@ compos@@ es the weak points of Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ g@@ ams &apos;s arguments :
did Mr. Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam &quot; beli@@ ve a mistake &quot; or was it a sin@@ ner ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if Singapore is not a country , we are only considered an independent and sovereign state ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if not , in which country do the sovereign rights of the city go back ?
Singapore is unique , it is equally land and city .
since he plays an important role within the cabinet cabinet , Mr. Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam &apos;s statements are of serious importance .
why do the people of Singapore help their military service , but don &apos;t they defend their city ?
who has to pay back our prime minister ?
what is the value of our pink identity card ?
are we citizens of a country or the inhabitants of a city ?
the Journal of the Journey of a Dec@@ ade to affir@@ m , Singapore is and was always a city :
&quot; I didn &apos;t say what I said ... &quot;
this sentence seems to have anno@@ yed many people of Singapore ...
nobody ever said that Singapore is a country .
we were always a city .
we have always been a city / island state .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I can understand that we often hear statements like &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; defense of the country &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; etc . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we should rather speak of the defense of the city .
the myth of the &quot; cute Canadian &quot;
the Canadian N@@ ed Flan@@ ders .
screen@@ shot from a YouTube video .
recently , Global Vo@@ ices asked his editors : what is the most mis@@ understood aspect of your home country or home country ?
your answers will be published here as part of an ongoing series , with which rum@@ ors about certain parts of the world are being revealed and another fac@@ et is to be shown .
the latest part of this series comes from Nev@@ in Thom@@ p@@ son , editor for Global Vo@@ ices Japan , who lives in Canada and Japan .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the question most posed in Japan is : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; are you Americans ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; no , I am sorry , &quot; I will answer . &quot; I am from Canada . &quot; since 1994 I have been living in Japan .
depending on the situation the conversation takes place , it is considered pol@@ ite to show interest in his conversation partner by asking personal questions .
my clari@@ fication usually follows the standard answer : &quot; Oh , Ro@@ cky Mountains , ice ho@@ ckey , nature . &quot; many Can@@ adi@@ ans perhaps cook inside fur@@ y when they are kept for Americans , but that doesn &apos;t bo@@ ther me .
for someone who doesn &apos;t know each other , there is little that Can@@ adi@@ ans differenti@@ ate us from Americans .
this is one of the reasons why so many Can@@ adi@@ ans attach a Canadian flag well visible to their ru@@ cksack when they travel .
all dear Can@@ adi@@ ans .
Americans , on the other hand ... .
so it was already when I began to travel through the world 20 years ago - before Donald Tr@@ ump , before the invasion of Iraq and before September 11 .
Can@@ adi@@ ans have always carried small map@@ le leaves on their luggage in order to distinguish themselves from their American neighbors .
we have a free healthcare !
there are no weapons with us !
same @-@ sex marri@@ ages have been legal in Canada since 2005 !
everyone seems to think Canada is so great .
we are pol@@ ite .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we often say very often &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; excuse . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Canada is said to be the most toler@@ ant country towards ethnic groups .
we are not as these guys south of the border .
we Can@@ adi@@ ans are nice .
I hate this .
first , I have many American friends whom I admire very much .
I wouldn &apos;t mind if you were confused with Johnny from Dallas for example .
with Marc from Austin .
with Adam from San Francisco .
or with Michael from Hon@@ ol@@ ul@@ u .
there are also some problems with the stamp &quot; nice . &quot;
first , being called &quot; nice , &quot; is basically to be sp@@ ook@@ y - just like the good @-@ nat@@ ured , gentle but tra@@ gically in@@ significant figure N@@ ed Flan@@ ders from &quot; Die Simp@@ sons &quot; ( which has its own Canadian Doppel@@ gÃ¤n@@ ger ) .
if Canada is really a nation full of people like N@@ ed Flan@@ ders it would indeed be a step forward . but the real problem is that &quot; nice &quot; has no personality .
there are no corners and edges , nothing you can encounter .
to be harmless means to be in@@ con@@ spic@@ uous and un@@ interesting and to earn no attention .
this can be something good , if you want to stay un@@ noticed in the background , far away from things that happen around you .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I would even go as far as to say that the desire to be free and alone is a major characteristic of the Can@@ adi@@ ans . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we tend to take care of our own affairs .
what out@@ si@@ ders refer to as &quot; nice &quot; is perhaps simply cool pol@@ it@@ eness .
Can@@ adi@@ ans often talk about the fence with the neighbors .
we lack the warm , open friendliness that I now connect with my American friends .
luckily for us ( and for the rest of the world ) then Jus@@ tin Tru@@ deau entered the stage to show that Can@@ adi@@ ans are more than just &quot; kind . &quot; our prime minister has made Canada down@@ right sexy .
music Video of a Pop band par@@ o@@ dies Thailand &apos;s Jun@@ ta
a pop band , famous in Thailand , has published a music video which the j@@ un@@ ta par@@ o@@ ys , which in 2014 seized power and , despite its promises to restore the civilian government , continues to rule the country .
the new song &quot; Dic@@ t@@ ator Girl &quot; ( P@@ ha@@ det Girl ) of the Tat@@ too Colour &apos;s band describes a young man telling what regulations his girlfriend makes for him .
although not explicitly political , the music video refers indirectly to the continued military rule of the Jun@@ ta .
the band was praised by many fans and other Internet users for their courage to describe the situation of the country .
the video to the song was a huge success .
only within the first three days , the video uploaded on Facebook was 1,@@ 25@@ 4 times shared and received 8,@@ 800 songs .
last month , even the Charlie Chap@@ lin video &quot; Der Dic@@ t@@ ator &quot; in Thailand was blocked after a group of activists requested the public to watch this video .
the video can be interpreted as a creative and entertaining introduction to Thai politics , especially as it beha@@ ves with the country &apos;s position under the rule of Jun@@ ta .
take a look at these videos of the video that relate to some of the political issues that Thailand has pursued over the past three years .
the &quot; 44 Rules of the Girls &quot; may be related to the dra@@ con@@ ian section 44 of the provisional Constitution , which gives absolute discretion to the commander @-@ in @-@ chief of the army on important national issues .
the 11th Rule : &quot; change your attitude &quot; refers to the not@@ orious programme for the &quot; change of imagination &quot; by journalists , students , scientists , activists , politicians and other individuals who are considered critics by the Jun@@ ta .
the picture above reflects the introduction of the law on computer crime , whose vag@@ ue and unclear regulations are often used by the authorities to arrest activists and other critics of the state .
for this purpose , a new unit was set up in the army which monitors the online content and prosec@@ uted those accused of having slan@@ dered the monarchy .
Thailand implements a stri@@ k@@ ingly against &quot; Read Maj@@ este &quot; ( Maj@@ estic insul@@ t ) .
on 20 May 2014 , the martial law was proclaimed in Thailand .
two days later , it came to a coup d &quot; Ã©@@ tat of the army .
one of the problems that the j@@ un@@ ta continues to pursue is their decision to buy expensive sub@@ mar@@ ines , although security experts warned them that the purchase is unnecessary and a waste of tax pay@@ ers .
in the video , it is even shown how people are thrown into a black van before putting them into an intern@@ ment camp , another problem .
some journalists are in prison because they allegedly caused &quot; confusion &quot; in society and Internet users are threatened with long prison sentences , they should off@@ end the monarchy .
meanwhile the te@@ aser of the song showed members of the band who im@@ itated the Sal@@ ut from &quot; The Tri@@ bute of Pan@@ em , &quot; which was already used by put@@ sch opponents during the protests in 2014 .

the following article , written by D@@ mit@@ ri Stat@@ ey@@ no@@ v , was first published on the OC Media website and published here with kind permission .
the post @-@ war society reco@@ vers only very slowly in East @-@ Ab@@ k@@ ha@@ zia , especially in the district of T@@ ku@@ er@@ al .
over 20 years have passed since the Geor@@ gian @-@ Ab@@ ch@@ as@@ sic war has been officially terminated , but its sc@@ ars are still strongly visible in this part of the Republic .
the abandoned villages of the northern district in T@@ ku@@ er@@ al show striking images .
villages such as D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha , Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a , Py@@ at@@ aya Shak@@ h@@ ta , Poly@@ ana and K@@ har@@ mac@@ ava are located in the coal @-@ basin of Ab@@ k@@ ha@@ zia .
various ethnic groups such as Russians , Greeks , Ne@@ ar @-@ Asia , Geor@@ gi@@ ans and Armen@@ ians lived and worked together in Soviet times in the area .
many of them had to leave their homes during the war .
today , the largest part of Russians and har@@ es live in the area .
such settlements are also called gh@@ ost towns in Ab@@ k@@ ha@@ zia .
during the pre @-@ war period more than 10,000 people lived here , today there are only a few hundred people in these gh@@ ost towns .
this phenomenon is characteristic of T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al .
since 2011 , the total population of the district has been 16.@@ 000 people after it has barely risen over a decade .
in 1989 about 4@@ 3.000 people lived in this district .

the empty five @-@ story blocks of the Soviet Union from the early 1960s , called Chr@@ u@@ sch@@ t@@ ch@@ kov@@ kas , symboli@@ ze the decline and devast@@ ation of the region .
the buildings decay and very rarely , they are inhabited by more than two families .

at the entrance of the village D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha I met a native old man .
he starts a conversation and it is difficult for him to end this .
&quot; all this is a result of the war . &quot;
&quot; can I talk to you ? &quot; why talk ?
it is nevertheless unique . &quot;
before the war , the village was full of life .
there were community centres , schools and kinder@@ gar@@ tens , all of which served the community .
now there is only paved road with f@@ aded magni@@ fic@@ ence buildings .
the people who once lived in this place and made their contribution to the central planned economy of the Soviet Union have now left the district .
about fifty people live in the gh@@ ost town of D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha .
about 38 people live in Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a , in the other villages it looks similar .
the K@@ hr@@ us@@ h@@ ch@@ ow@@ kas that host one or two families can be seen at the balconies where the clothes are dried .
two young girls , both seven years old , look out of the window of a destroyed house .
when they discover me with the camera in my hand , they immediately withdraw .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our mother has forbidden us to let ourselves be photograph@@ ed , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says one of the girls . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it simply forbidden us , that &apos;s all . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the girl whis@@ pers something to her girlfriend and suddenly they leave the destroyed building and disappear .
many people in the area are working for a small Turkish mining company called T@@ ku@@ er@@ al@@ u@@ go@@ l .
families are also involved in the sub@@ sist@@ ence economy ( cultivation of agricultural products for personal use ) such as cattle breeding , be@@ eke@@ eping and vegetable cultivation .
it &apos;s difficult to get over the rounds .
the district administration provides free candles and bread to the villages in winter .

about ten years ago an older woman named Gal@@ ina ( or A@@ unt G@@ aly@@ a , as it is called in the neighborhood ) moved from Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a to J@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha .
despite her el@@ dest daughter , who lives in France , Gal@@ ina did not leave Ab@@ k@@ ha@@ zia to live with her . &quot; my heart will always remain in Ab@@ k@@ ha@@ zia , &quot; she says .
Gal@@ ina does not want to receive financial help from her daughter and insi@@ sts that she supports her young grand@@ sons instead .
Gal@@ inas &apos;s monthly pension is just nine dollars .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you have neither a vegetable garden nor a house , it is very hard to survive , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

if holidays are , we will visit .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but we can &apos;t do this all the time - everyone is busy with his own problems . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
while telling her story a younger neighbour appears on the balcony .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Nat@@ ascha , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; calls A@@ unt G@@ aly@@ a to her . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they said we could build Zu@@ c@@ ch@@ ini . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I have already prepared the ground .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know what will happen , but we will build cour@@ get@@ tes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; you can get used to everything &quot;
G@@ aly@@ a &apos;s convers@@ ation@@ alist Nat@@ asha lived together with her husband and the five common children in her house for a while .
Nat@@ ascha was 11 years old when the war began .
every day she rec@@ alls the village life before the war .
despite the relatives living in Central Russia , Os@@ se@@ tia and Georgia ( the country of Ab@@ k@@ ha@@ zia just broke away ) , they did not have the opportunity to leave it .

&quot; we recently purchased land in Su@@ k@@ hum@@ i ( administrative capital city in Ab@@ k@@ ha@@ zia ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to build a house there , but it will take a while , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she explains . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Nat@@ ascha gets about $ 9 child benefit for each child .
her husband is working in the coal mine .
the young family has their own farm .
near the house where Nat@@ asha &apos;s kinder@@ garten was once , they hold pigs , cows , co@@ cks and chi@@ ckens .
it tells us that at first it was a very sc@@ ary situation when many people left the village after the war .
but over time it lost its anxiety .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are not afraid of the dark street or the few people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
you can get used to everything .
many people believe that these buildings were destroyed during the war .
but in fact , it has something to do with lo@@ oting .
after the war there was hardly any work and all lived as it was right for them .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I remember every day the city and the war were once . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
when our conversation tends to end , a little boy runs over to us .
it runs through the window of a destroyed building and hi@@ des itself .
a ball flies out of the window and another boy ch@@ ases him afterwards .
he plays with the ball rolling down the hill .
a group of children now pursu@@ es the ball .
while they run , some of them throw stones on the falling buildings .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Mexico , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mama Africa &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; houses migrants on their long journey &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

this article by A@@ my Bra@@ cken was published on April 19 , 2017 on the website of our partner PRI@@ .org and appears here with kind permission .
on the way of migrants crossing Europe or Latin America , certain places are known for their hospitality .
I visited one of these places in the Mexican city of Tap@@ ach@@ ula , it is located on the border to Guatemala .
it is a very simple hotel near the city center .
it is led by a 59 @-@ year @-@ old Mexican woman , a small woman with a coral @-@ pink spectacle frame and gold colored ear@@ rings in t@@ ed@@ dy bear form .
she is called Con@@ cep@@ ci@@ Ã³n Gon@@ z@@ Ã¡@@ lez Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez and was born in Tap@@ ach@@ ula and grew up there . nevertheless , they know many under the name Mama Africa .
this nick@@ name is due to the fact that the hotel ( or rather it itself ) has become a destination for Afri@@ cans and Hai@@ tians who are on transit .
the hotel has no charm .
for about 2.@@ 50 dollars per night , guests sleep in simple rooms , with bare , crum@@ bling walls and metal beds .
in the vesti@@ bu@@ le there is a par@@ rot in a cage .
there is no sign to the hotel - however , hundreds of African and Hai@@ tian migrants arrive here .
sometimes , Mr@@ s Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez , the people come in full mini@@ buses and from the upper part of the coast they begin to call : &quot; Mama Africa !
where are you Mama Africa ? &quot;
currently it is rather quiet , but this year Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez already received 200 guests at the same time .
there are only 24 rooms , some of them already slept outside on cardboard boxes .
she doesn &apos;t want to reject anyone .
she also helps them and brings them to the hospital when they are ill , they buy them medication they can &apos;t pay , they massage them with a bal@@ m the feet exhausted by the long journey .
Ty@@ ch@@ que Sebas@@ ti@@ ao , originally from Angola , arrived recently .
I asked him if Mama Africa was an appropriate nick@@ name for Ms. Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez .
the family Sebas@@ ti@@ ao ( with her daughter Mer@@ ru@@ i , who has a yo@@ gh@@ ur@@ t@@ bart ) pos@@ ing with Con@@ cep@@ ci@@ Ã³n Gon@@ z@@ Ã¡@@ lez Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez .
the family came from Angola to Brazil and hopes to go to Boston .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yes , yes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he answers with a smile . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I really feel that it suits her , as African women are very nice women . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
very loving .
she has the warmth of a mother ...
we feel very comfortable here . &quot;
Sebas@@ ti@@ ao travels with his sister , hoping to go to Boston to find her husband and the three children .
they have lived in Brazil , but it is for some Afri@@ cans who are on the way to the United States to make a first stop in South America and then move north .
the family had heard from other companions of Mama Africa . &quot; Mama Africa is a well @-@ known name on the track , &quot; explains Felix Michel@@ et , a guest from Haiti .
he tells that Hai@@ tians and Afri@@ cans often travel together and that Afri@@ cans are already talking about Ms. Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez &apos;s W@@ hat@@ s@@ app .
as many of his companions , Michel@@ et has lived in Brazil and worked as a construction worker for the construction sites of the Olympic Games and the World Cup .
when the Brazilian economy was weaker , he began his journey to the United States .
he has been a guest at Mama Africa for months : he sells SIM cards to save the necessary money in order to buy the bus ticket to Ti@@ juana .
I wonder if he will get in touch with Mrs. Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez in the future .
&quot; Mama Africa is our mother and we never leave her again , &quot; he answers smiling . &quot; we will always stay in touch . &quot;
Ms. Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez tells her guests often send text messages when they are gone to greet them or to tell her about the course of her trip .
she explains that her Christian faith is the drive of her work .
she doesn &apos;t know much about Africa , but her guests have taught her to prepare chicken as in Ghana .
Ms. Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez is perhaps very well known here , but she is not the only spark of hope for the migrants who travel through Tap@@ ach@@ ula .
at the other end of the city a dead end leads to Jes@@ Ãº@@ s Valen@@ zu@@ ela .
this winter , Valen@@ zu@@ ela and his family have taken up migrants in their small house .
he is a polic@@ eman and has found that the bus tickets to numerous African immigrants are sold too expensive .
he has begun to help them get a reasonable price , then he offered them his house for a dollar the night .
at the moment there are 25 people , mainly Hai@@ tians .
some sleep on the floor , but at least they have electricity , a washing machine and a cooking area outside .
Valen@@ zu@@ ela explains that he knows what the guests are going through .
&quot; I have lived in the United States , &quot; he says . &quot; I have experienced what they are experiencing .
I crossed the border over the desert and we suffered .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are places where people don &apos;t help and others don &apos;t help . that &apos;s why I give them my support . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after having lived for three years , he was exp@@ elled from the United States after a raid on his job .
the majority of migrants who travel through Tap@@ ach@@ ula comes from Central America , other inhabitants also open the doors of their homes for them .
JosÃ© Antonio Cor@@ dova Mel@@ Ã©@@ n@@ dez tells me that he fled to Honduras with his wife and his three children , who wanted to black@@ mail him money without having a plan .
in Tap@@ ach@@ ula , he asked for an accommodation and an unknown , an all @-@ in @-@ one , offered him their roof .
a few months later , the family still lives and tries to decide where to go .
back in the house of Mama Africa , everything is full of guests again .
in the ais@@ les , the travellers are looking cal@@ m@@ ly into their phones .
a mini@@ bus arrived today and brought 20 new guests , a large part of Somalia .
Ms. Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez seems happy that her house is full , but she is also nostal@@ gic because of those who have gone away .
she looks like a proud grand@@ mother in her album with numerous photos .
there is one of her daughter with African hair @-@ care that she has made a client , some photos of her grand@@ children and many travelers more , young and old .
she laughs sadly as she presents her briefly .
&quot; Ya &apos;@@ fu@@ er@@ on , &quot; she repe@@ ats every time . &quot; they have already gone . &quot;
China : X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang residents are forced to install a monitoring app on their mobile phones .
a check @-@ point for personal communication devices in X@@ inj@@ ang from Twitter users has been ma@@ stered .
the inhabitants of X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang , an ethnic minority region in western China , are forced to install a sp@@ y@@ ware on their phones .
on July 10 , mobile users in the Ti@@ an@@ sh@@ an district of Ur@@ um@@ qi received a cell phone notification in which it instruc@@ ts the district government to install a monitoring app named J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang ( or &quot; Web Clean &quot; ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the message , it is said that the app &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; prevents access to terrorist information . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , the authorities could use the App for more than comb@@ ating terrorism .
according to an exclusive report by Radio Free Asia , 10 Kaz@@ ak@@ h women were arrested in the autonomous Il@@ i Kaz@@ ak@@ h pre@@ f@@ ecture because , shortly after they had installed the app , they exchanged messages with a private chat group .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the police informed the police that the app would identify and track the sources and distribution channels of the terrorists along with &quot; illegal religious &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; activities and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; harmful information &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; including videos , images , e@@ Books and documents . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
J@@ ing@@ wan@@ ang &apos;s website describes the app as follows :
J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang is a protection service with system categories for children and adults , introduced by Ji@@ angs@@ u T@@ elec@@ om .
the main feature is blocking por@@ no@@ graphic websites , from online fraud , tro@@ j@@ ans and ph@@ ishing sites to make users aware of how much time they spend online and remotely control their home network .
this app with filtering for min@@ ors is designed to help children develop a healthy lifestyle .
an app with these functions can of course be used in many ways .
for example , the &quot; remote control &quot; could enable government actors or even h@@ ack@@ ers to manipul@@ ate or steal the home network of a person .
this introduction is in line with other measures to control the digital activities in this region .
while messages about digital cens@@ orship in China mostly focus on the experiences of users in the larger cities in the east and south , reality is very often glo@@ omy for those living in remote , crowded ethnic minority regions such as X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang and Tibet .
in order to limit un@@ rest and dis@@ content in the conflict areas , the authorities often arrange extreme cens@@ orship and surveillance measures as well as routine Internet shut@@ downs .
the Twitter @-@ based media outlets &quot; Images from mainland China &quot; ( all of which have been ma@@ stered ) , the cens@@ ored news published in China , showed photos from a check@@ point where police inspec@@ tors checked the people random@@ ly to see if they had installed the surveillance app .
the authorities in X@@ inj@@ ian make sure people use the official J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang app .
mobile notification required people to install the app within 10 days .
if you are detected at a check@@ point with a device without this software , they could be det@@ ained up to 10 days .
this is a set@@ back for technological development .
they have forced people to use devices intended for older people .
this is a form of captivity by the rest @-@ growth technology .
we are back in Ma@@ os China .
&quot; images from mainland China &quot; ( all of which have been ma@@ stered ) also published a J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang product description from which the software can raise the password request of a Windows operating system and thus get unlimited access to the hard drive of the computer .
after installing J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang , computer and mobile phones will become electronic hand@@ cu@@ ffs in X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang .
the regulations in J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang might be a reaction to the instructions of the City Council , to minim@@ ise the dis@@ semination of illegal contents .
all government branches , authorities and related institutions , including universities and research institutions , are obliged to follow the instructions of the Cyber@@ security Office during the operation of their computers and communication devices .
a recent report by Freedom House , an American human rights organisation , also mentioned these new surveillance methods :
in X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang , on June 27 , in a district of the regional capital of Ur@@ um@@ qi , the authorities issued orders to all residents and entrepreneurs to register their &quot; personal ID cards , mobile phones , external drives , portable hard drives , not@@ ebooks and media memory cards &quot; at the local police station .
the intention is obviously to identify and destroy any &quot; terrorist videos . &quot; however , this action viol@@ ates the rights of Ur@@ um@@ qu@@ is &apos;s three million inhabitants and gives them pen@@ alties for a number of other possible off@@ enses , including those relating to peaceful religious or political messages .
sleep or death , part 1 : everything cri@@ es out after death
a single cell in Old Du@@ b@@ bo Ga@@ ol .
photo by : Cor@@ rie B@@ ark@@ li@@ more ( CC B@@ Y 2.0 ) .
this is the first of six reports in the series &quot; sleep or death &quot; in which the activ@@ ist Sar@@ mad Al J@@ il@@ ane describes his experiences in a Syrian prison .
far from our blue , virtual world , you look at yourself and realize that you are alone in a place where all important things have disappeared .
everything has gradually dissolved and revealed a truth that is clearly identi@@ fiable both from the inside and from the outside .
one that makes all honor to their name .
one that has kno@@ cked down into a list of feelings and expressions that do not allow met@@ aph@@ ors .
but if the reality cat@@ ches you back and you look behind the scenes - beyond the drama , the beautiful scenes and the performer - the characters transform into beings of flesh and blood , and everything cri@@ es out after death .
all doubts arise in smoke and you will be aware of your existence even if the earth is spinning on the axis of the evil . it becomes clear to you that you are trapped between the walls that your parents , and before them your grand@@ parents , have built stone for stone .
they arrested me and my father three times , but that was not enough for me to &quot; learn my lesson , &quot; as the chief of the security service put it down - with the promise that the fourth time would be a pleasure .
he proved his power over us by destroying even the simplest concepts we knew .
five you@@ ths were ri@@ pped during a peaceful protest like we@@ eds from the beautiful garden of our revolution .
it was sufficient for the city to cr@@ ush the darkness of the night with &quot; All@@ ahu Ak@@ bar &quot; scre@@ ams .
all the neighbor@@ hoods were cov@@ eted , only my own .
for the first time it was quiet , moti@@ on@@ less , at the wrong time , even if I had no high demands on a city that has been stu@@ ffed up to the arter@@ ies with state security organisms and their accompli@@ ces .
in the third night , things had cal@@ med down after the power supply stopped working in the neighborhood .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I broke the silence by shou@@ ting &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; All@@ ahu Ak@@ bar &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from my roof . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I heard my voice rever@@ ed through silence .
a few minutes later , some of my friends felt brave enough to come together .
I was not alone .
many friends , true friends joined me ; we alli@@ ed to a splendid image that filled my expectations fully and completely .
at such a moment , you are aware that you liber@@ ate the mind from the lamp , but it simply does not interest you in the least .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I received a call from my father : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; get ready , we meet at the Military Security Building . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he laid up .
then I learned the following : no matter how much honey you can swal@@ low - nothing can give you back your voice after you scre@@ amed it all the way to the security service office .
I arrived there .
the Col@@ onel Gh@@ ass@@ an stood there with several of his men ; my father was already there , as I now .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Col@@ onel Gh@@ ass@@ an starts speaking : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; let me hear how you scre@@ am &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; All@@ ahu Ak@@ bar &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or you are only brave enough to scre@@ am if we are not close . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his hat@@ eful eyes were on me .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and you dare to look into my eyes and not to the ground ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
what I did then has nothing to do with courage .
I was 18 years old , it was the fourth time I stood in front of this building .
perhaps it was in my fol@@ ly , vanity ; perhaps in the revolution .
I was so sure of my case when I replied , &quot; I didn &apos;t think you &apos;ve forgotten my voice since yesterday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and I think I never stopped looking at you , so why should I do it now ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was the shortest entertainment that could have such fatal consequences for me , and yet I don &apos;t regret a word of what I said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; put him in sol@@ itary confin@@ ement and his father straight away . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; his father is the same . &quot;
the sten@@ ch of this cursed movement lies in my nose to this day .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he became a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; syndrome , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a mental torture that I was exposed to months . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I went through the courtyard .
in the first office I leave everything I carry with myself .
then back through the yard and into the second office , which leads through a corridor to the individual cells .
I take all the details exactly before I enter the room .
otherwise they have given me a larger cell this time .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have to share it with only one more prisoner and I must immediately set myself without waiting for permission . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after a few minutes that felt like a whole life , the civil servant left the cell and I went back to a tried @-@ and @-@ tested method of communication : beating the f@@ ist against the wall .
I learned that my cell @-@ mate was a &quot; first @-@ f@@ ender . &quot;
after a long hes@@ itation he finally answered me .
apparently , none of the surrounding cells was a prominent middle @-@ aged man who looks similar to me and is called &quot; the doctor . &quot;
in perfect darkness , no striking facial features can be seen , and doctors don &apos;t exist here ; we are all just numbers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; maybe someone whose voice sounds like mine ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
all the answers deny his existence .
perhaps he was transferred to one of the big cells .
perhaps he will be heard right away .
the investig@@ ator had assured me that they would release him if I remain .
li@@ ars .
I would have liked to have a scar@@ ec@@ row to drive out all these crow@@ s , which refresh themselves at the fruits in the garden of my head .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from the distance , I still hear them cry &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; All@@ ahu Ak@@ bar &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it must be at about 10 o &apos;clock in the evening ; always at this time the scre@@ ams spark@@ le every day .
the door opens .
I was always convinced that black is the color of per@@ dition until I saw the yellow light shining in person : Ra@@ ad ( for example : &quot; th@@ under , &quot; all@@ usion to 13 S@@ ure of Kor@@ an ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they are here to be heard . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this revealed the secret : to protect the state security from us and to prevent us from expos@@ ing the tra@@ it@@ ors and terrorists in us , they speak in the al@@ a@@ wi@@ tic dial@@ ect - so they played out their denom@@ in@@ ational black@@ mail and betra@@ yed the tight field of view of their world@@ view .
this is not a house that is not a country ; it is a curse that they call co@@ existence to transform the criminals of their cl@@ an into a hero .
I enter the audi@@ torium and meet Abu Ima@@ d , a slim and sto@@ cky man ; at least he pre@@ tends to me .
he starts a &quot; pleasant &quot; conversation , despite the facial expressions that der@@ ail him : &quot; my boy , you are still young , you can start so much more important with your life than join those Ta@@ ge@@ di@@ eben and protest in demonstrations that will soon come to an end anyway . &quot;
I did not answer .
I got used to it , not to answer .
I can &apos;t really say exactly when insul@@ ts and pun@@ ches have become an ordinary means of communication for me after a friendly conversation .
when and how this happened was un@@ important .
some voice in me said that I had to get used to being punished , even though I had done nothing to deserve this penalty .
of punishment in all their diversity .
his command is to tear me as much meat as possible from the body .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he calls this lovingly &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; con@@ fession . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it starts with a plastic tube which probably originates from the clo@@ aks .
your exec@@ ution@@ er will delight in your cry .
give him the pleasure , you cannot measure yourself with him and you cannot with@@ hold your cry .
my cry didn &apos;t fall to him yet enough , which is why they exchanged the pipe through a cable .
during my first arrest , I asked if the investig@@ ator had previously worked as a garbage collector or whether it belonged to the standard equipment .
they had inter@@ tw@@ ined four cables in order to show us the great invention of a huge cable from their point of view .
within one hour three of them changed while I was still on the line .
I had lost any feeling in my body - and also my voice , which is why I stopped scre@@ aming .
the exec@@ ution@@ er noticed the cooling and didn &apos;t enjoy it , which is why he was next to an electrically charged staff .
electricity flow@@ ed through my entire body , enough to provide my whole neighborhood .
my half @-@ naked body lying on the floor was the perfect conductor .
the num@@ b@@ ness disappeared and the pain was back again .
after two terrible hours he decided he had fulfilled his duty for that night .
this must have been around midnight .
I decided to sleep again ; let &apos;s say this was my only option .
a few hours passed that seemed to me like minutes .
then the call to the morning prayer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the door opens and the morning light fills the room . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; R@@ aus with you , Ar@@ sch@@ fi@@ cker &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I answer with the voice of an exhausted young people : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my Lord , my Father must be afraid . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; be quiet and move away , you will be moved . &quot;
that was new .
otherwise they always kept me free .
where do they lead me ? !
the Jord@@ anian z@@ apper Em@@ s@@ all@@ am H@@ da@@ i@@ b talks about the rights of LG@@ B@@ T@@ Q + community , freedom of expression and resistance
Em@@ s@@ all@@ at H@@ da@@ i@@ b smo@@ kes a cigarette in his studio .
the photo was taken by A@@ man Mad@@ an , the original author of this text .
Em@@ s@@ all@@ am H@@ da@@ i@@ b sp@@ ends most of his time inside ; sometimes he s@@ miles to his screen , sometimes to his computer , sometimes and again to his couch .
but what you can rely on is a cigarette between his fingers or his lips infected with ni@@ cot@@ ine .
he lives on the top floor of his family house , which has belonged to them since 1967 ; the year in which Israel completed his occupation of the West Bank and H@@ da@@ i@@ bs family forced themselves to flee from their village in Palestine , in which they lived as sulph@@ ur@@ ye@@ es ( approximately : farmers ) .
for six years now , H@@ da@@ i@@ b has been a passionate activ@@ ist who faces the conservative majority and questioned their established opinions on gender roles , sexu@@ ality and freedom of expression through art and rap@@ es@@ eed music .
with his music , which often deals with themes such as Ori@@ ent@@ alism , rac@@ ism and the situation of Palestinian refugees , he also challenges the core of the entire Arab world . all these issues are not only relevant in his hom@@ etown of Am@@ man , but also in cities that range from Damascus to Syria in Yemen .
at the age of 25 , H@@ da@@ i@@ b sees himself as someone who is not limited by boundaries in his mind , and can feel according to his own statement with the people who suffer from the devastating consequences of foreign interventions in countries such as Iraq , Yemen , Syria and Libya .
even if he does not openly admit it , he has a special reluc@@ tance to American foreign policy .
H@@ da@@ i@@ b looks at his art in his studio in Am@@ man .
recorded by the author .
H@@ da@@ i@@ b does not believe that his compassion for those who try to survive in war zones , have anything to do with his identity as &quot; Palestinian refugees of the second generation , &quot; he calls himself , even though he was born in Jordan and has never been in Palestine .
&quot; I don &apos;t think about my own circumstances , &quot; H@@ da@@ i@@ b emphasizes .
then he adds : &quot; I think so because I &apos;m a man , &quot; while he po@@ urs out n@@ es@@ cafÃ© in water in two cups . it &apos;s the holy month of Ram@@ adan ; at that time it is intended for Muslims to fast from sunrise to sunset .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Jord@@ anian law also states that the public consumption of food is illegal during the Ram@@ adan . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
obviously H@@ da@@ i@@ b has a certain weakness for breaking with ancient traditions ; on the other hand , having a cup of coffee on a scor@@ ching hot j@@ unk day has little to do with protest against Islam .
in principle , the s@@ war@@ ms of lu@@ ke@@ warm coffee and the squ@@ ad@@ ron of the K@@ ent @-@ cigarette in the nose speak primarily of freedom .
sometimes Jordan is like a prison in the open sky , especially if you have a look at the neighbouring countries .
therefore it is easy to do basic things - as in the public during Ram@@ adan to drink water - in order not to land in prison .
recently the Ministry of the Interior has cancelled a performance by the band Mas@@ h@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ Lei@@ la , already for the second time .
some parliam@@ ent@@ arians who support the Islamic action front - the Jord@@ anian branch of the Muslim Brotherhood - argued that the sexual orientation of the hom@@ os@@ exual front @-@ singer , Ham@@ ed Sinn@@ o , contradic@@ ts the country &apos;s cultural and traditional norms and is the main reason for the concert .
the deputy and former spokes@@ woman of the Islamic coalition Dim@@ a Tah@@ bou@@ b said in an interview with CN@@ N that the concert &quot; just &quot; had been canc@@ eled because of the sexual orientation of the singer .
many also claim that the engagement of the band in matters such as the Arab Spring , human rights and free expression in the Arab world is dangerous activ@@ ism , which question the old proven legi@@ timacy of author@@ itarian regimes across the region .
in a public statement , Mas@@ h@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ Lei@@ la estimated the Jord@@ anian people as &quot; progressive supporters of human rights , &quot; who continue to use &quot; for intellectual and cultural pl@@ ur@@ alism . &quot;
this statement might not be simply shallow rh@@ et@@ oric , but actually reflect an increasingly clear cryst@@ alli@@ zing reality in Jordan which appears clearly in H@@ da@@ i@@ bs &apos;s work .
in 2016 , H@@ da@@ i@@ b returned traditional gender standards by making his vision of the fate of Arab women who have pre@@ mar@@ ital sex .
the picture shows the skel@@ eton of an apparently lowered unknown woman whose arms and legs stretch up to the corners of the screen .
it is surrounded by a red lake ; perhaps the blood of the countless women who have lost their lives through the hands of those they should actually trust .
in the past few years , the number of &apos; hon@@ our@@ able mur@@ ders &apos; has increased in Jordan - the un@@ official outside .
according to Human Rights Watch , the number of voluntary mur@@ ders reached its peak in 2016 ; however , it is still ag@@ grav@@ ating that Jordan lacks the institutional infrastructure to support the women who have attempted murder or domestic violence in an appropriate way .
according to a Act on Crime of Crime from 1954 , women who are exposed to the risk of domestic violence can &quot; be det@@ ained at an in@@ definite time in prison , &quot; and for their release it is often necessary for years of bureaucratic expendi@@ tures as well as the guarantee on the part of the family that nothing will happen to the woman .
H@@ da@@ i@@ b &apos;s music is also very popular and is known to shy away from issues that have long been considered tab@@ oo in his country .
H@@ da@@ i@@ b den@@ ies that his work is political , but ad@@ mits that he cannot separate his music , which is full of explicit references to sexu@@ ality , freedom and expression .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I come from the Middle East , man . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I was attached to politics , &quot; he says .
in a song called &quot; Edward Sa &apos;@@ ed , &quot; H@@ da@@ i@@ b tackl@@ es the question of Palestinian identity .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Law@@ la al 3@@ ai@@ b &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and in &quot; Gh@@ are@@ eb &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the focus is on poverty . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the list of songs that are political at the core can be continued .
in March 2016 , H@@ da@@ i@@ b published a song entitled &quot; Sant@@ and@@ ano . &quot;
in this song , a verse often repe@@ ats itself :
&quot; you are free , and everyone else is . &quot;
in the further course of the song H@@ da@@ i@@ b describes the world as a kind of market on which one , in his words , &quot; can get what you want &quot; - be it faith or non @-@ belief , hetero@@ - or homosexu@@ ality .
he notices that hardly anyone in Jordan is talking about the rights of gay people and les@@ bians and that comments on equality between LG@@ B@@ T@@ Q + individuals have been strongly cens@@ ored until 2014 .
in 2014 , H@@ da@@ i@@ b presented an interview for the popular Jord@@ anian online program Ro@@ ya to later mem@@ ori@@ ze that his comments were torn out of context , distorted and cens@@ ored in his opinion .
&quot; it was uploaded to Youtube without cuts , but only a modified version , &quot; he says .
today , H@@ da@@ i@@ b is openly campaig@@ ning for the Arab LG@@ B@@ T@@ Q + community and believes that intoler@@ ance to homosexu@@ als does not correspond to Islam .
he men@@ tions Abu Nu@@ what , a poet of the eighth century , who still remains in memory thanks to his homo@@ erotic poems .
H@@ da@@ i@@ b asks : if Abu Nu@@ what , who later should work on behalf of the cali@@ ph , could write openly about homosexu@@ ality in the eighth century , why can Jord@@ ani@@ ans not do that ?
the real problem , so H@@ da@@ i@@ b , has nothing to do with Mas@@ h@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ Lei@@ la or the fact that the concert was cancelled .
in the h@@ ash@@ em@@ ian kingdom there is nothing new that the government sanc@@ tion attacks on freedom of expression and that progressive voices are sil@@ enced .
more recently , in January 2017 , the Jord@@ anian Intelligence Service determined several former government officials and members of the educational association with the reason that they have cri@@ tically critic@@ ised the issues related to corruption in the country .
in view of this , H@@ da@@ i@@ bs &apos;s opinion is just the tip of the ic@@ e@@ berg - the real challenge is to bring about a structural change in the next generation of Jord@@ ani@@ ans .
for him progress is a constant giving and taking . Jordan has performed Mas@@ h@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ Lei@@ la for the second time in a row , but the path of progress - that is H@@ da@@ i@@ b - consists of slow , deliber@@ ate and inner changes . he is sure that these changes take place from day to day in the heart of the Jord@@ anian society .
in the end H@@ da@@ i@@ b , like millions of other Arabs , dreams of an Arab world without intervention from abroad .
he does not only dream of bringing his work to Bag@@ h@@ dad , Jerusalem and Damascus , but also to &quot; experience it . &quot;
perhaps the region will approach a genuine and fundamental openness by means of music , art and literature - and not through bombs , cluster muni@@ tions and arti@@ fici@@ ally induced demo@@ cra@@ cies . at least he hopes that .
as far as this is done , H@@ da@@ i@@ b will continue ra@@ cking and thus resist@@ ing resistance .

Neb@@ uta in A@@ om@@ ori is one of the 3 largest festivals in Japan .
these big , extravag@@ ant war@@ ps are so fantastic ! ! !
there are numerous theories regarding the origin of the Neb@@ uta festival .
one assumes that there is a variation of the Tan@@ ab@@ ata Festival , which is usually also celebrated in many areas of T@@ oh@@ ok@@ us in August . another theory states that the fe@@ ats , the drums and dancing have been handed over more than a thousand years and come from a time when armies swe@@ pt from the west of Japan to the northeast to force the indigenous people of the region , the em@@ iss@@ hi , to the knees .
we are at the Neb@@ uta festival in A@@ om@@ ori .
we were able to grab some great seats , so we have a great view .
one can only imagine how large these parts are ...
a joint centre in the capital city , Meg@@ uro Ga@@ el@@ en , hosted a two @-@ month exhibition to W@@ a no Ak@@ ari ( literally .
I have been looking forward to the Meg@@ uro G@@ yo@@ en for a long time : two fixed cars are just to be seen .
nevertheless , for many people who take the trip to A@@ om@@ ori , the Neb@@ uta festival is the only true - and still a breathtaking way to spend his summer :
&quot; Y@@ att@@ em@@ are !
Y@@ att@@ em@@ are ! &quot; # Summer festival in the north of the country .
I was there and watched the # Neb@@ u@@ a@@ Festival .
the sight of an 18 metre high truck was incredible .
let &apos;s enjoy the rest of the summer !
young Peru@@ vi@@ ans trade weapons against scissors and raz@@ ors

rarely external appearance and personal care were as important as in this story , as they help to keep the Peru@@ vian youth out of crime and to promote a legitimate profession like the hair@@ dresser &apos;s .
El Call@@ ao , Peru &apos;s most important port , is located on the coast of the Pacific Ocean , close to the historic center of Lima - a region with a very high crime rate where street rob@@ ber@@ y and illegal drug trade are all @-@ day .
a survey published in April 2017 showed that 5@@ 1.5 percent of the population in this region will not feel safe .
at the same time Peru - like many other Central and South American countries - experiences an increasing demand for aesthetic services for men .
the trend , the appearance and thus also the unusual hair@@ styles of famous sports@@ men such as Paolo Gu@@ err@@ ero ( Peru ) , Ar@@ tur@@ o Vi@@ dal ( Chile ) , Pedro Gall@@ ese ( Peru ) , or N@@ ey@@ mar ( Brazil ) have led to the fact that more and more normal citizens go into the experienced hands of hair@@ dres@@ sers who can recre@@ ate these elaborate hair@@ styles .
the unprecedented demand for hair@@ styles that go to the extreme limits of imagination and creativity has even inspired an annual event , the competition of hair@@ dres@@ sers &quot; Bat@@ alla de Bar@@ ber@@ os , &quot; which has been taking place since 2014 .
there experts join each other to show who of them can create the most ec@@ centric looks as you can see in the following video ( more videos on current competitions are available on the public Facebook profile Bat@@ alla de Bar@@ ber@@ os ) .
educational institutions such as the school August@@ o Sal@@ azar Bon@@ dy , located in El Call@@ ao , found here an opportunity to convince young people to exchange their weapons against hair@@ dressing tools and to get training in hair style instead of bad advice , which allows them to find work .
motivated by this activity and the opportunities offered , dozens of young people have seen that they can take a job that is currently in fashion .
before the school year beginning in March , the school offered special training workshops and reported on some of its successes :
in 1995 , we were the only school in the municipality and the district where we are very proud , because we have built this educational community out of love for the children .
Colombia : letter of Love to guer@@ illa fighters
photo : Valent@@ ina Mon@@ sal@@ ve .
use with friendly authorization .
the following article is the edited version of the &quot; Love message to guer@@ illa fighters , &quot; published by the international online magazine Tea After T@@ wel@@ ve .
the contribution will be published here as part of a partnership with Global Vo@@ ices .
why do we only write love letters to people we know ?
isn &apos;t it much more important to accommodate people who feel ex@@ cre@@ ted ?
exactly this question left the young Colom@@ bian activ@@ ist Leonardo P@@ Ã¡@@ r@@ ra@@ ga von der Bo@@ got@@ a and Cris@@ tian Pal@@ aci@@ os from the Young @-@ Youth Foundation and inspired them to the campaign of Cart@@ a p@@ or la Rec@@ on@@ ci@@ li@@ aci@@ Ã³n ( Let@@ ters to Rec@@ on@@ ci@@ liation ) , encouraging young people to write letters to guer@@ ri@@ lla fighters .
only recently , their country was the scene of a historic event and they wanted to contribute their part : after years of negotiations , the Colom@@ bian government had concluded a peace treaty with the guer@@ ri@@ lla movement F@@ ARC ( German : revolutionary armed forces ) , which forms the conclusion of the longest armed conflict in Latin America .
the signing of the peace treaty was considered to be so significant that the Colom@@ bian president JosÃ© Manuel San@@ tos received the Nobel Peace Prize for his mer@@ its .
however , before the Colom@@ bian people there is still a long way to talk about real reconciliation and peace .
guer@@ ri@@ lla fighters who lived in illegal camps for many years , were exposed to a war rh@@ et@@ oric and carried arms around the clock , must now integrate themselves into life as civilians .
the Colom@@ bian society , again accustomed to life in constant fear and in some cases of deep hatred of guer@@ ri@@ lla fighters , must now take it into their ranks and support them in the construction of a new life .
Leonardo and Cris@@ tian were convinced that the young Colom@@ bians could join together and help in the integration process .
and that &apos;s exactly what they did : until now , thousands of young people have already written letters - messages to former guer@@ illa fighters to welcome them back to society .
the aim of the campaign is 6@@ 900 letters - one for every former guer@@ illa fighter - to be handed over personally .
Valentine &apos;s Day as an inspiration for the campaign
the idea for the letters to reconciliation was created at the World Summit of Nobel Peace Lau@@ re@@ ates , which took place in Bo@@ got@@ Ã¡ in February 2017 . there , Leonardo and Cris@@ tian had the opportunity to speak shortly with K@@ ail@@ ash Sat@@ yar@@ th@@ i , which was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2014 .
this explained that we write thousands of love letters on Valentine &apos;s Day , but forget those who need them much more .
he plans to share his love with people this year , who needed most urgently .
thus the plan was to write letters full of hope and support for former F@@ ARC fighters who have now to find their place in society and build up a new life . &quot; the letters will show that the Colom@@ bian society is ready to make the discourse of a history of war a common history of peace , &quot; they say .
until now , more than 2,000 letters have been collected during the campaign .
the initiative is represented in all major cities such as Cal@@ i , Man@@ ic@@ ales , Med@@ ell@@ Ã­n , Bar@@ ran@@ qu@@ illa and Bo@@ got@@ Ã¡ .
&apos;@@ i never thought that someone would forgive me &apos;
the first 500 letters were handed over to one of the UN camps in the region of Cal@@ don@@ o @-@ Cau@@ ca on March 19 .
a group of 40 students from Ja@@ veri@@ ana University in Cal@@ i , two members of the Municip@@ ality of Cal@@ i and Leonardo from the Bo@@ got@@ a Foundation travelled to the camp to personally transfer the letters .
the members of the F@@ ARC were as they had done earlier in order to receive the orders of their leaders .
but this time they received no orders , but letters full of support from people from all over the country .
it was a very moving moment for all involved . &quot; it is unbelievable how many different feelings one can go through in just a few hours - from fear to happiness , and all that lies in between , &quot; said the political science student Manu@@ ela Jim@@ Ã©@@ ne@@ z A@@ vil@@ a later .
Sandra Par@@ ra , an employee of the Gover@@ nor of the province of Valle del Cau@@ ca described this unforgettable experience :
after passing the letters , a former fighter led me through the camp of the guer@@ ri@@ lla fighters .
when I saw in one of the &quot; Cam@@ bu@@ ches &quot; ( a kind of hut in which the guer@@ ri@@ lla fighters live ) I saw a guer@@ illa fighter who wrote something .
I was afraid to go down , because next to him on the bed there was a mosquito net , a deadly weapon in the Sle@@ eping Palace .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; H@@ ello , what are they doing ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he replied , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I answer a letter someone has written to me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is a very nice and hop@@ eful letter .
never in my life has someone written such a beautiful thing to me , therefore I answer it . &quot; suddenly tears ran over the che@@ eks .
I hu@@ gged him completely and put me next to the pom@@ eg@@ ran@@ ates .
perhaps he was sorry for the war , I was sorry to be all the years of the faithful companion of this warri@@ or , and wanted to help him write this letter .
the man told me more about his life . he had never expected something different from life than war . to join the F@@ ARC was the only way to preserve him and his six brothers before the Hung@@ er@@ to@@ d . &quot; I never thought anyone would forgive me for my mistakes .
but now I know that there is a society outside that wa@@ its for us with open arms .
until now I have only learned how to deal with weapons .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but now where peace reig@@ ns , I can learn many things and work in dignity . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
new voices and voices
to start with , students and some of the F@@ ARC leaders joined a discussion group .
the students were all grown up as already war and the F@@ ARC was already in secret .
that is why the leaders of the F@@ ARC declared the history of the organisation , their ide@@ als , and gave insight into their views on the peace process : &quot; for many years we have witnessed the social injustice done by the state to the whole Colom@@ bian people . now , where we have the opportunity to develop ourselves into a political party , we can help shape society in this country more just .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a goal of this magnitude is to overcome all obstacles , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said one of them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Manu@@ ela was impressed :
to hear these people who have never heard their hearing and had no right to choose , and to realize that the people I have often seen as a monster and even hated even people with beautiful feelings turned up@@ side down by their circumstances and their environment was very painful for me .
the reality in which the country lives is hur@@ ting me .
but it comforts me that all people - including those who have killed and have done so much damage , can teach us something and give a smile and a hu@@ g .
many former fighters have responded to the letters .
Gu@@ st@@ av@@ o Gon@@ z@@ Ã¡@@ lez , the camp &apos;s commander in Cal@@ don@@ o @-@ Cau@@ ca , wrote the following letter , for example , Dar@@ Ã­o de Jes@@ Ãº@@ s Mon@@ sal@@ ve , Archbishop of the town of Cal@@ i :
the Colom@@ bian people were proph@@ esi@@ ed that peace would reign after dis@@ arm@@ ament .
but that is not the case .
as long as there is ine@@ quality , hunger and lack of education , health care and employment opportunities , there will always be people ready to resort to arms , to rise and protest for their rights . and that is also completely justified ( ... ) .
we at the F@@ ARC now focus on peace , on a policy without weapons .
that is why we call on all def@@ enders of peace - no matter what race , religion or ideology they belong - to rise above all those who dream of a country in war .
we give you our word , make our contribution and offer sacrifices , for we know from our own experience that nothing is easy . those of us who defend life as the basis of existence will face many difficulties .
there will be many obstacles on our way , but together we will overcome them .
a Trans@@ woman talks about the persecution in Ch@@ echn@@ ya and the life ahead of Kad@@ y@@ rov
a Ch@@ echn@@ ya card , with surrounding autonomous regions and countries .
Creator : Peter F@@ itz@@ ger@@ ald .

it follows the translation of an article written by our partner Ai@@ da Mir@@ mak@@ bu@@ owa and whose first publication took place on the OC Media website .
hom@@ os@@ exual and qu@@ eer people living in the Cau@@ cas@@ us region are exposed to a wide range of threats - including discrimination , physical and sexual violence and black@@ mail .
with horror , activists have witnessed the reporting of the last months on the persecution of gay men in Ch@@ echn@@ ya .
but the threat , which hangs above the LG@@ B@@ T@@ Q community in the LG@@ B@@ T@@ Q community , has not only emerged overnight .
OC Media had the opportunity to talk with a trans@@ sexual woman from Gro@@ z@@ ny who shared some of her experiences with us and talked to us about what is currently happening in the Republic .
the LG@@ B@@ T@@ Q legal situation in Ch@@ echn@@ ya has captured the international head@@ lines several months ago when reports were published that addressed the deport@@ ation , torture and killing of qu@@ eer men in the Republic .
the first report was published by journalist Elena Mil@@ la@@ ina in the Nov@@ aya Gaz@@ eta ; she threw a light on the methods of the Che@@ chen authorities , who arrested suspi@@ cious men and put them into secret pris@@ ons in gun .
&quot; you brought a monster to the world &quot;
Sab@@ rina , a Trans@@ woman , was born in Gro@@ z@@ ny and grew up there .
she already felt that she was a woman in reality .
when she grew up , she realized that Ch@@ echn@@ ya was not a safe place for her , which is why she moved to Moscow .
after having experienced a group of Ch@@ ech@@ ens from the sex equ@@ ation of their land@@ lady , the hunt was opened on Sab@@ rina .
out of fear for her life she moved to the US last time .
Sab@@ rina : I was a volunteer in a human rights organisation .
one day I told me that someone needed my help .
it was a friend of Da@@ gest@@ an , a woman who was in trouble .
she had no money , so I took her without hes@@ itation .
while I tried to help her , someone from whom I thought he would be a friend , a copy of my documents and spread it all over the internet , with my phone number and a picture of me . he sent her to his Che@@ chen friends , with the following message : &quot; then there are no men in Ch@@ echn@@ ya that can eliminate this shame ? &quot;
after that , the photos from my documents made the rounds through W@@ hat@@ s@@ App .
on 10 October 2015 I was attacked .
when I was about to bring out a few shopping bags from the back seat of my car , I heard a man &apos;s voice saying : &quot; here is a gift for you from your unc@@ le . &quot;
when I turned around , I felt something in my body , but I didn &apos;t hurt .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; then I heard one sentence , but this time in Ch@@ echn@@ ya : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how long will you still honor the family , you Sch@@ and@@ fl@@ eck ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I didn &apos;t know the person .
I only know that it was a young man , not 30 years old .
then I lost consciousness and woke up again in the hospital .
apparently some women had received everything and started crying .
the man was fled .
the women had called a ambul@@ ance .
in the hospital I learned that I had two patches in my right lung .
OC Media : in which cases have you been laid - in the men or the women ?
Sab@@ rina : my documents are dated , there is still my male name on it ; but the doctor understood and put me to the women .
I am very grateful to him for that .
when I read his name for the first time in his office , I got to do it with fear ; it was a Muslim , a Cau@@ ca@@ sian name .
but he turned out to be a good person .
I am grateful to him for having dealt with me respect@@ fully .
I spent more than a month in hospital .
last February I received threats .
they called me , wrote to me - relatives , strangers , some completely unknown .
that was the beginning of a night@@ mare .
my family was visited by neighbors and some distant relatives .
they demanded to send me back to Ch@@ echn@@ ya to prove that it was all a lie .
they presented absurd demands : some told me that I must prove it by running up without the streets ; others wanted me to appear on official TV in Gro@@ z@@ ny and say that I had not changed my sex that everything was just bad , and Photos@@ hop .
I have size C - what would I have to say on TV ?
OC Media : how did your family try to deal with this pressure ?
Sab@@ rina : it &apos;s still difficult for her .
some elderly people once spoke to my mother on the street .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they said to her , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; You have brought a monster to the world that has corrupted not only your family , but the whole republic . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we cannot touch you because you are a pi@@ ous woman , but you have to disappear from here . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
my mother became too much and she put a rope around her neck .
luckily the neighbours came and saved them .
at the time I had to change the apartment several times a day .
I moved to an apartment and a few hours later , under the window a car with dark@@ ened windows and a number plate with a 95 mm .
after it happened the third time , I realized that there was a bit la@@ zy .
my human rights friends checked the number plates - it turned out that I was persecuted .
OC Media : how did you fly ?
Sab@@ rina : with the help of activists .
for security reasons I don &apos;t want to reveal their names , but I want to say that I remember them all ; they really helped me .
with their help I left the country , but then something incredible happened .
I can still not understand how it could be .
shortly before I left Moscow , I bought a new SIM card to call my mother once I arrived .
I bought it without registering myself , without reference , without everything .
I broke my old SIM card and threw it into garbage .
arrived and checked into the hotel .
the number was registered to a stranger .
I put the SIM card into my mobile phone .
the moment I wanted to call my mother via W@@ hat@@ s@@ App , I got a message : &quot; you don &apos;t think you &apos;re in security just because you left the country ?
our people already know in which hotel you are stuck . you even know your room number .
just to prove it to you : it is the number 115 . &quot;
can you imagine this ? !
that was actually my room number .
OC Media : are you still in touch with your family ?
Sab@@ rina : only with my mother and my sisters .
but we don &apos;t talk about the gender equ@@ ation , that &apos;s a tab@@ oo theme .
I still carry some traditional Cau@@ ca@@ sian elements in me .
as much as I wish , I can &apos;t overcome this mental barrier .
I always say that as long as my mother is alive , I will do my best to not hurt her .
when we chat with camera , I actually try to look like the person she re@@ members from her past - so to my male form .
but that is very difficult .
OC Media : do you know something about the current situation in Ch@@ echn@@ ya ?
what do your friends do , those who have stayed there ?
Sab@@ rina : I filed a report in Washington last week .
for this I needed up @-@ to @-@ date information on the situation in Ch@@ echn@@ ya .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I talked to someone who has been in gun in gun for one and a half months . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he said that during Ram@@ adan , no people were arrested and tor@@ tured , but also that all the end of Ram@@ adan could hardly wait , and he did not lock a new wave .
most likely , they will now focus on family and relatives .
with this I mean , they probably charge the relatives , they take care of the problem with the person concerned and at the end ask for proof that the so @-@ called &quot; honor &quot; has experienced through blood satisfaction .
OC Media : are gay men still trapped in these secret pris@@ ons ?
Sab@@ rina : a friend of mine says that there were not so many .
if then , above all those who have no rich relatives or who have been dropped by their relatives in order to set up Kad@@ y@@ rows &apos;s judgment .
as far as I know , they are held there so that they can be presented later as terrorists .
say : if they are killed , they will show their bodies on television and claim they have attacked any village or military base .
do you understand ?
as if these people were not simply disappeared , they were deliberately sub@@ merged in order to radic@@ alise .
OC Media : is this just a guess or do you have a source for this information ?
Sab@@ rina : I just quote someone who was imprisoned in gun for one and a half months .
he says that many people have gone missing in this prison after their beard grew .
there was nothing new about them ever since .
they just took it along .
and this so @-@ called Lord , this person was even present when these people were taken .
up to now , however , they were not presented as ban@@ dits , but there have been no reports yet . we suspect that such actions are quite possible .
why else wouldn &apos;t it have allowed these people to shave ?
do you know whether these persec@@ utions and kidn@@ app@@ ings of people belonging to so @-@ called &quot; non @-@ traditional &quot; orientation have already taken place in the past ?
Sab@@ rina : I always wore my hair long .
in Ch@@ echn@@ ya I had a Bob .
I think I was already known in Gro@@ z@@ ny before 2003 when I was still living there - and I never had any problems .
in ear@@ nest !
even from 1998 to 1999 , when the Sh@@ aria was applied , I never had any problems .
on the contrary , it was much safer at that time than now .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Russia originally intended to bring us to the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; civili@@ sation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; but finally dropped us back to the Stone Age . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
OC Media : how is it possible under the Sh@@ aria law ?
Sab@@ rina : my ey@@ eb@@ rows were plu@@ cking ; I had colored lashes , bore tubes and short stops .
the security ministry of the Sh@@ aria never curved me a hair .
in front of the Russian theatre in Gro@@ z@@ ny there was a place where every evening , especially on weekends , met a whole group of people like me .
it was a small place where several benches were standing , and the whole city knew about it ; they knew why men , young people , met there .
we were never offen@@ ded .
in the Che@@ chen language there is a saying : K@@ har@@ da@@ h K@@ har@@ da . that is , &quot; Don &apos;t worry about the mis@@ fortune of another . &quot;
it is often said to be children when they make fun of the sick .
OC Media : so they simply closed their eyes to you because they believed you were ill ?
Sab@@ rina : yes .
they never offen@@ ded me , never hun@@ ted and never sm@@ itten me .
OC Media : how long did this time of grace last ?
Sab@@ rina : as long as Kad@@ y@@ rov came to the plan .
when he was appointed Prime Minister in 2005 , he began to speak on mor@@ als on television .
he did not speak about us per se , but primarily about the behavior of women .
nevertheless , one could feel how the people in the city began to change .
those who had smil@@ ed before and laugh@@ ed at once saw you with suspicion .
in time I left Ch@@ echn@@ ya .
but every time I came back home I could feel the situation in the Republic deterior@@ ated steadily .
OC Media : what activity do you have to do now ?
Sab@@ rina : I work as a wa@@ it@@ ress .
I do not earn a lot - 700 to 800 dollars per month are not much in the US .
apart from that , I still work as an activ@@ ist .
currently I am responsible for 15 Muslim women .
I communicate with them as a kind of psych@@ ologist .
we organize tea riffs , gather@@ ings , I accompany them to the hospital and help them get food cards .
I don &apos;t have a cent for it for a long time .
I discovered these people themselves when I took refuge .
I am Muslim and want to help those who need help .
OC Media : do you wear a Hid@@ den@@ ab ?
Sab@@ rina : that &apos;s sil@@ ly .
so nature is , that has nothing to do with religion .
this is exactly the same as Ch@@ ech@@ ens , who want to make you white with foam in front of the mouth , that there are no ga@@ ys with them .
the Da@@ ge@@ stan@@ ters who have the cab@@ ar@@ ins who , the Russians too , have what ; on the whole planet , there are them - but &quot; not in Ch@@ echn@@ ya . &quot;
I &apos;m from there , so it &apos;s unpleasant to hear something like that .
I meet so many men from the Cau@@ cas@@ us here .
many of them - practicing Muslims who go to the mos@@ que and fasting during Ram@@ adan - live together with men .
know , many think about transitions to men who love men , and they believe that you change their sex to make more intimate experiences . but that &apos;s a fall@@ acy .
these are two different things - two different ways of feeling to be precise , different life settings .
for me it is the most important thing to feel in my own skin and not to be ashamed of my body .
not if I have a partner or not .
sorry I &apos;m going to be so personal here , but my last intimate relationship is now more than a year ago .
and I &apos;m not sad at all - I just know that I am now myself .
local groups warn of an increase in suicide within the im@@ pover@@ ished Arab Ah@@ ra@@ zi community in Iran
the Iranian Ah@@ ra@@ z region is suffering from an un@@ usually high unemployment and poverty rate within the native Arab population .
since the last few months there has been a strong increase in suicide .
the photo of the Arab workers in Iran was provided by the Patri@@ otic Arab Democratic Movement in Ah@@ ra@@ z .
photo : use with permission .
the self @-@ inc@@ iner@@ ation of a man named Y@@ assi@@ m Mor@@ amaz@@ i on 27 August returned the desperate situation of the Arab Ah@@ ra@@ zi community in Iran , which is shaped by poverty and unemployment , into the spotlight .
Mor@@ amaz@@ i was married and had a child ; he lived in Al @-@ Tha@@ w@@ ra in the Ah@@ ra@@ z region in the south @-@ west of Iran .
he suffered from anxiety , depression , and he was ashamed for his own hel@@ pl@@ essness , the inability of his family to rise , so Ah@@ wa@@ zi human rights groups who want to work in Ah@@ ra@@ z and remain anonymous .
a video shared on YouTube kept the moments after he had lit himself .
some people quickly managed to er@@ ase the fl@@ ames , and Mor@@ amaz@@ i was brought to the Tal@@ e@@ gh@@ ani hospital in the town of Ah@@ wa@@ z .
according to local sources , the burns were so strong that doctors were unable to do anything .
he died shortly afterwards .
it was not the only suicide that happened in August within the Arab Ah@@ ra@@ zi Min@@ ority , and activists on the ground warn that even more men could take life .
the Ah@@ wa@@ zi Centre for Human Rights reported that several others - Ham@@ id Mani@@ at , Ali Haz@@ ba@@ wi , S@@ ayed Fal@@ ah M@@ ous@@ sa@@ wi and Sha@@ hab Ban@@ i Tam@@ im - were hanging .
their stories have one thing in common : they were all family fathers who felt hel@@ pless because of the persecution by the Iranian government , hel@@ pless and in@@ capable of feeding their families and pursuing a safe work .
Arab Ah@@ ra@@ zi suffer from poverty , unemployment and discrimination
the region where a large part of the Arab Ah@@ ra@@ zi community living in Iran has been shaken by a profound economic crisis that makes it difficult for the native Arab population to deny its living .
a century ago , the Arab Ah@@ ra@@ z was a predominantly autonomous region in Iran until the P@@ ah@@ la@@ vi monarchy assumed power and under@@ took great efforts in 1925 to end ethnic autonomy throughout Iran .
in the Ah@@ wa@@ z region , there are some of the largest oil and gas fields occurring in Iran , as well as some of the most profitable and valuable uses for Iranian agriculture .
despite these valuable resources , the regional economy continues to develop slowly , and the local population only gets little of this wealth .
it is often the victim of untreated illnesses , hunger and de@@ priv@@ ation .
the Iranian regime systematically refuses to create jobs in the local oil , gas and petro@@ chemical industries .
the government has also built a large number of dam@@ s , the water from the Arab areas into the Persian areas , where the provinces Is@@ f@@ ah@@ an , Y@@ az@@ d , Ker@@ man and G@@ ho@@ m lie .
these dam@@ s have only led to ag@@ grav@@ ating the devast@@ ation caused by d@@ rought in the region , and to destroy the local farming as well as the fish and palm industry .
the unemployment rate among the Arab a@@ haw@@ ks has now risen to 81 % .
N@@ our Mohammed P@@ ur , the Iranian General Director of Co@@ operatives , Labour and Social Wel@@ fare , reported that 5 % of Ah@@ wa@@ z@@ is , who are looking for a job , completed primary school , completed 55 % of a secondary school and 45 % have a university degree .
a &quot; systematic strategy ... aimed at exter@@ min@@ ating the spirit of national resistance &quot;
Kar@@ im Do@@ him@@ i , an Iranian Ah@@ ra@@ zi human rights activ@@ ist living in London , told Global Vo@@ ices that the current situation , a mix of &quot; poverty , unemployment and rac@@ ist ethnic discrimination , &quot; led to a &quot; high rise &quot; of the number of suicide among young Ah@@ ra@@ zi men .
Do@@ him@@ i said that especially unemployment has become worse . the reason for this is a combination of a high number of ethnic Per@@ si@@ ans and an anti @-@ Arab discrimination in the recruitment process :
since officials and institutions do not pre@@ fers to hire Arab workers , the local Arab Ah@@ ra@@ zi is deprived of access to employment opportunities in all sectors .
this is part of a systematic policy of the ruling regime , which aims to destroy the spirit of national resistance by young Arabs and force them to earn their living outside their native country of Ah@@ ra@@ z .
there are people who had to change their first and last name to hide their affili@@ ation to the Ah@@ ra@@ zi , and to be hired as even Arab names in the workplace are not tolerated , let alone speak the Arabic language or wearing Arabic clothing .
given the circumstances that the Arab Ah@@ ra@@ zi have to endure , human rights ab@@ uses strike alarm before the situation becomes explosive .
it remains to be seen whether the world w@@ akes up and takes notice of it .
the main reason for suicide is un@@ treated depression .
depression is treat@@ able and suicide is avoid@@ able .

&quot; why don &apos;t I identify with femin@@ ism , even with the inter@@ sec@@ tion@@ alism ? &quot;

the following article is a revised version of the opinion written by Ay@@ om@@ ide Zur@@ i and was originally published on the website A@@ fro@@ f@@ Ã©@@ min@@ as . the article was the subject of several discussions in which many different positions came to expression .
you can read in the comments below the original text .
when I say that I am not a femin@@ ist , many women - especially white women , who call themselves inter@@ sec@@ tional fem@@ inists - react with fru@@ stration .
they wonder why I am not part of the movement .
they even lay well @-@ thought out scientific and soci@@ etal arguments in front of me why I should be femin@@ ist and why we should generally be all fem@@ inists * inside .
for example , women nowadays still earn less money than men , despite the same education .
that women are still under strict observation when it comes to what they are allowed to do with their body .
that violence against women is a global epide@@ mic .
or that cultural and social norms still ensure that women sooner or later encounter a glass ceiling in various spheres of life , and that discrimination on the basis of sex always moves across the many different countries and beliefs .
all of this is known to me and known .
I am convinced that I am double and triple below .
I am a black woman .
and yet : if I come to talk about skin color , on rac@@ ism , on black women &apos;s women , black women in the LG@@ B@@ TI@@ Q community or on black women from the Dias@@ por@@ a ; if I mention how we have always been ab@@ used in physical , mental and verbal , both in and out of the femin@@ ist movement , many white female fem@@ inists decide to remain silent .
but they all agree that women - all women - should come together in order to &quot; lift up their voices and &quot; Kum@@ ba@@ ya , my Lord &quot; to achieve equality ( some ) of women .
but they don &apos;t want to talk about the fact that there is an institution@@ alized form of rac@@ ist violence in addition to sexu@@ alised violence that we are faced with black women in two ways .
or that black women and women of other eth@@ ni@@ cities and places of origin deserve less than white men and women .
that black girls and girls with a migration background are often referred to school as white girls due to obvious integration problems .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or that women in black spheres and women with a migration background are exposed to a higher risk of suffering domestic violence and violence in the partnership than white women . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the one hand , I want all women , all men and all men of all skin color to have the same rights ; on the other hand , I cannot join me as a black woman , in whose center the white woman stands who refuses to take into account injustice in her mind , which refer to both the gender and the skin colour of a person .
I am exhausted and will no longer fight for my affili@@ ation in a white @-@ femin@@ ist @-@ oriented sphere , which always rejected me and countless other black women over and over again .
in 18@@ 51 , So@@ jour@@ ner said in her speech , &quot; Am I not a woman ? &quot; and I too refuse to maintain an ideology in which the black woman is a horri@@ fied and margin@@ alized creature in a historic sense .
I refuse to join groups who also absorb our customs and customs through cultural appropri@@ ation to advance their eg@@ oc@@ entri@@ c programme .
I will no longer try to suggest white women the importance of overl@@ apping skin color and gender . for some of them will continue to mention the importance of black women for the femin@@ ist movement , no matter how many black women try to teach them for the better .
although the inter@@ sec@@ tional femin@@ ism was founded to give women of different origins a home and distinguish themselves from the white femin@@ ism , the word &quot; femin@@ ism &quot; still lies in its name .
I prefer to trigger myself fully and completely from femin@@ ism and to join the movement of W@@ om@@ an@@ ism , which was created for my dark skin and my status as a woman , rather than to use me for a white @-@ femin@@ ist paradig@@ m that is so persistent that inter@@ sec@@ tion@@ ality is celebrated as a novel phenomenon .
now it is more important than ever before that we define black women according to our own ideas and set ourselves in the spheres that are created by us for us .
Cl@@ enor@@ a Hudson @-@ We@@ ems , author of the book Afri@@ cana wom@@ anism : recall ( about : Africa @-@ W@@ om@@ an@@ ism : how we can defend ourselves ) speaks of the fact that we can defend ourselves by defining our own way . and not only that - black women can also create spaces in which they can be completely safe and in which the cultural , spiritual , spiritual , physical and even the spiritual elements can be worshipped that make up the black woman .
although some white and sec@@ tional fem@@ inists are immediately calling separ@@ atism and exclusion after reading these lines , I ask you to inform yourself about hypo@@ cris@@ y and the contradictions of the femin@@ ist movement , of which the black woman is concerned .
in a wom@@ an@@ ist environment I can lift black women and women of other cultures , for in this paradig@@ m I exist .
I am recognized as a part of this paradig@@ m because of my dark skin and my existence as a woman .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I , a black woman , can blo@@ om in an environment in which my life has neither passed , nor ignored , nor rejected . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
p@@ add@@ ling the pollution : a man &apos;s mission to protect rivers in Iraq for future generations
this article by To@@ dd Reu@@ bold was originally published at En@@ si@@ a.com , a magazine which reports on international efforts to solve environmental problems .
within the framework of a content sharing agreement , this article will be published again .
Nab@@ il Mus@@ a has repeatedly travelled to Iraq over the past seven years - mostly with sur@@ f@@ board or in can@@ oe - with a special concern from Kur@@ dist@@ an Region in Iraq . his mission aims to make people aware of the importance of clean waters for present and future generations .
in this documentary by E@@ mil@@ y Kin@@ sk@@ ey we follow Mus@@ a , who explains his relationship with the region &apos;s rivers and the impact of pollution on his church .
&quot; I absolutely wanted to do something for the river that we had lost when I was a child , &quot; Mus@@ a tells .
scientists from all over the country fear that the decades of war , the construction of dam@@ s , pollution and un@@ controlled development , will lead to a direct water crisis in Iraq .
Mus@@ a is a member of the Non @-@ Govern@@ mental Organization Wat@@ erk@@ ee@@ pers Iraq - a subsidiary of Wat@@ erk@@ e@@ eper Alliance - who is committed to protecting the rivers , streams and water@@ ways in Iraq , as well as supporting local communities in the sustainable use of these natural resources . &quot;
at the end of the video , Mus@@ a summari@@ zes the ur@@ gency and importance of his work : &quot; if we had no water , how would we survive ? &quot;
this video was produced , filmed and published for En@@ sia by E@@ mil@@ y Kin@@ sk@@ ey , a documentary film@@ maker and multimedia journalist based in Iraq .
the focus of her work lies on persecuted , little @-@ acclaimed sub@@ cultures and is characterized by the use of co @-@ operative vide@@ ography and new multimedia techniques , with whose help supp@@ ressed congregations can tell their stories in their own way .
Paragu@@ ays women and their difficult fight against violence

the following article is the abbrevi@@ ated and edited version of the article &quot; The Wave of Viol@@ ence Against Women in Paraguay . &quot; the article belongs to the series # Por@@ ser@@ Mu@@ j@@ er ( # lar@@ gen@@ ein@@ ef@@ rau@@ bin ) , which reports about the violence against women in Paraguay .
most names have been changed to protect the persons affected .
a police comm@@ iss@@ ar A@@ da B@@ Ã¡@@ ez said that she could do nothing against Luis Bal@@ bu@@ ena , her ex @-@ partner , who had become violent .
since the end of their relationship some time had passed and the police said that their statement would be put to the files , but more could not be done .
when another woman showed Bal@@ bu@@ ena due to mi@@ stre@@ at@@ ment , A@@ da B@@ Ã¡@@ ez did not find anything useful .
a few days later , the second woman with@@ drew her ad .
breaking the vi@@ cious circle of violence against women is difficult .
in general , if women complain at all , they generally do not receive support from the state .
in many cases , women are also financially dependent on men who abuse them . this also explains why only 20 % of all women who admit to be victims of violence can even report to the law enforcement authorities .
cont@@ ent@@ 1 Stri@@ kes and Statisti@@ cal 2 In@@ visible mi@@ stre@@ at@@ ment and a legal system that does nothing unter@@ ni@@ mm@@ t@@ 3 Paragu@@ ays laws : good approach , faulty implementation strikes and statistics
it is difficult to determine how many women are really mi@@ stre@@ ated , says My@@ rian Gon@@ z@@ Ã¡@@ lez , researcher for gender issues at the Centro de Docum@@ ent@@ aci@@ Ã³n y E@@ studi@@ a , a social scientific research institution in Paraguay . &quot; there are different indications and reports , but they do not even show the extent of gender violence against women in Paraguay . &quot;
the available numbers however are alar@@ ming .
in 2015 , the District At@@ tor@@ ney &apos;s Office filed 9@@ 600 advertisements for domestic violence . 70 % of it was about violence against women .
86 % of the ads in the police came from women .
there were over 5000 advertisements for domestic violence in the courts of peace . 86 % of the ads of women came here too .
in the ads 40 % of women reported that they were physically ab@@ used , 55 % of women spoke of mental abuse .
these statistics , however , do not show the true extent of violence against women in Paraguay .
according to the Paragu@@ ay@@ an women &apos;s minister , Ana Bai@@ ardi , only a few of these crimes are actually shown . &quot; on any woman who returns to Paraguay for psychological ill treatment , 9 women who do not do so .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; two women who do not do this because of physical abuse , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stated at the end of 2014 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
since women &apos;s murder in Paraguay is not a private off@@ ence , prosec@@ uting authorities cannot adequately document how many women are murdered by their current or former partners every year .
by August 2016 alone , journalists counted at least 12 cases of women &apos;s suicide in the country .
the coordinator of human rights in Paraguay documented at least 37 cases in which women were murdered by their current or former partners .
according to their estimates , every ten days a woman dies in Paraguay because of violence by men .

invisible mi@@ stre@@ at@@ ment and a judicial system that does nothing
before Mari@@ ana Br@@ Ã­@@ te@@ z became the firm girlfriend of Carlos Vera , he insist@@ ed that she called him the names of all her former friends .
at the beginning she didn &apos;t want to do that , but after that she had to repent .
today Mari@@ ana is 28 years old and no longer together with Carlos . but for two years she endu@@ red psychological violence - one of the most common forms of violence against women and at the same time the most difficult recognizable :
I never thought I would be a victim of abuse .
when I read about it earlier , I always thought that it only happens to women who are too sub@@ servi@@ ent because they are fo@@ ol@@ ed by violent men .
I was convinced that this would never happen to me .
Mari@@ ana used social media to report on the abuse of Carlos Vera .
without nam@@ ing names , she wrote contributions on Facebook , in which she described his insul@@ ts and various attacks during her two @-@ year relationship and told how he had isolated her .
many people responded to their contributions , including Carlos itself . he asked rh@@ et@@ or@@ ically whether he ever raised his hand against her and refused to admit that his behaviour was also a form of abuse .
other Facebook users asked Mari@@ ana why she had fallen away from Carlos for so long and did not leave him before .
it seemed almost as if they wanted to say that victims of abuse had at least a certain complic@@ ity in it .
Victoria San@@ tos , who did not come from Paraguay , fought for almost eight years with the authorities in Paraguay to prove that her former partner was mi@@ stre@@ ating her .
Victoria is a member of Y@@ o te Cre@@ o network ( &quot; I think you &quot; ) consisting of women who are all in some way victims of abuse .
in the group they can talk to others about their experiences , listen to each other and support each other .
they do what many others do not do : they take the statements of women seriously .
in Victori@@ as case , everything began with psychological abuse .
her wealthy partner finally managed to convince her that she was worth@@ less .
then he began beating them .
Victoria &apos;s ads with the authorities remained without a result and also from their relatives , they did not receive any support .
she led a trial against her former partner , who developed into an un@@ man@@ a@@ geable legal battle between Paraguay and her home country , in which it was mainly about money , power and the influence of her former partner .
Paragu@@ ays legislation : good approach , poor implementation
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Paraguay there are many laws that are very good , but not to be applied . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the indication of abuse is a way of resist@@ ors and a fight against corruption in the judi@@ ci@@ ary , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Victoria San@@ tos . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Carmen Ech@@ au@@ ri , a representative of the UN organisation for women in Paraguay , also faces great problems in applying laws in the country .
on August 10 , 2016 , a draft bill was discussed at the Paragu@@ ay@@ an parliament which was announced under the h@@ ash@@ tag # Por@@ ell@@ as ( # for you ) .
this h@@ ash@@ tag and the # Ni@@ un@@ a@@ Men@@ os movement ( # Non @-@ Exten@@ sions ) are part of a Twitter campaign that is supported by Am@@ ne@@ sty International .
the original draft of the law proposes that Fem@@ izi@@ d is to be declared a perpet@@ ual offen@@ se and pun@@ ish@@ able as it is already the case in the neighboring countries of Argentina and Bolivia .
thus the bill was changed in a number of points in order to also win the de@@ pu@@ ties for the law , which feared that the way for de@@ crimin@@ alisation of abor@@ tions was generally denied , which is currently banned in Paraguay and pun@@ ish@@ able by up to five years of imprisonment .
the original bill was intended to cost the majority of the ( bureaucratic and economic ) proced@@ ural costs that the victims of violence have to bear themselves , if they just want to reimbur@@ se them and receive a secure accommodation to impose the state .
Ech@@ au@@ ri ar@@ gues that the law is not effective , if the legislature does not provide sufficient financial means for it :
in Paraguay , mi@@ stre@@ at@@ ment is seen as a part of inter@@ personal relationships .
a change must take place here , so that violence is no longer seen as a normal thing .
whoever is silent in the face of these facts makes himself guilty and contributes to the fact that the perpet@@ rators are punished .
we have to reimbur@@ se for as long as mi@@ stre@@ at@@ ment is no longer considered normal .
on 10 November 2016 , the law passed in the Paragu@@ ay@@ an Senate . however , parts of the law had been altered , among other things a passage that the partners called for reconciliation in cases of domestic violence .
opinions on the changes are taking place .
the section on reconciliation was seen as an opportunity for the aggres@@ sor to attack his victim again .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the cancellation of the words &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sex , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; political force &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; sexual har@@ ass@@ ment &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from parts of the law however is considered to be a great set@@ back . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

independent media in Oman a year after a newspaper continues to attack attacks
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this website was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; locked &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the website of the banned paper Az@@ am@@ n . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
more than a year ago , the Turkish authorities closed the independent Arab @-@ language newspaper Az@@ am@@ n because of its coverage of corruption in the sul@@ tan .
You@@ se@@ f Al @-@ Ha@@ j , one of the editors of the newspaper , continues to be in prison where he served an annual prison sentence .
two other editors of Az@@ am@@ n , I@@ bra@@ him Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari and Zah@@ er Al @-@ A@@ br@@ i , were also arrested and tried in court , but later released .
Oman has been ruled by sul@@ tan Q@@ ab@@ us i@@ bn S@@ aid since 1970 , who came to power after he had de@@ posed his father , S@@ aid i@@ bn Ta@@ im@@ ur , by a coup d &quot; Ã©@@ tat .
since then , alongside his role as the only sul@@ tan , he has held the most important offices in the country : Prime Minister , Minister of Defence , Supreme Commander of the Ar@@ med Forces , Finance Minister , Foreign Minister , Chairman of the Supreme Council for the Planning and President of the Central Bank .
the Sult@@ an &apos;s rule is characterized by the insist@@ ence efforts of security forces , especially domestic secret services , public liber@@ ties , including freedom of the press , restric@@ ting freedom of press , independent journalists , blo@@ ggers and other activists , in@@ timi@@ dating and det@@ ained .
the authorities systematically restrict peaceful and legitimate activities in human rights and hin@@ der citizens , including activists , to freely express their views on public affairs of the country , such as corruption in authorities and institutions both online and offline .
the attack on the newspaper Az@@ am@@ n , her closure and the incar@@ cer@@ ation of three of her editors last year is a hard blow to press freedom in the country .
Az@@ am@@ n is an independent newspaper that has been reported since its inc@@ eption in 2007 on corruption in Oman ( an absolute monarchy ) until it was banned by the authorities in August 2016 .
on July 28 , 2016 , security forces I@@ bra@@ him Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari , editor @-@ in @-@ chief of Az@@ am@@ n , announced that an article entitled &quot; High @-@ level Parties to the Justice &quot; was published in the paper on July 26 , 2016 .
in the report , government officials were accused of having put pressure on judges of the Supreme Court in Oman to make a decision in a case of inheritance .

on 3 August 2016 , Zah@@ er Al @-@ A@@ br@@ i , Member of the Board of Directors , was invited to the special department by ISS and arrested on his arrival by the security forces .
on 9 August 2016 , ISS received the Deputy Editor @-@ in @-@ Chief You@@ se@@ f Al @-@ Ha@@ j , who had acted as editor @-@ in @-@ chief at Al @-@ Ma@@ xi &apos;s arrest .
the newspaper was closed in@@ definitely after the Minister of Information had given the order that &quot; the publication and distribution of the paper was prohibited by any means , including online , from 9 August 2016 . &quot;
on 26 September 2016 , before the Court of Mas@@ k@@ at , the first trial took place in the trial against Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari , Al @-@ Ha@@ j and Al @-@ A@@ br@@ i .
the Court sentenced the three journalists to prison terms and ordered the final closing of the newspaper .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari and Al @-@ Ha@@ j were both sentenced to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; violation of public order , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; abuse of the Internet &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; under@@ mining of the pres@@ tige of the state . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition , al @-@ Ha@@ j was found guilty of viol@@ ating a ban on publication and slan@@ dering .
al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari and Al @-@ Ha@@ j were sentenced to three years of imprisonment and fin@@ es in the amount of 3000 om@@ anic ri@@ al ( 7@@ 800 US dollars ) .
al @-@ A@@ br@@ i was sentenced to a year prison and a fine of 1000 Ri@@ al ( 26@@ 00 US dollars ) after he was found guilty of using an information network to dis@@ semin@@ ate material that could pose a threat to public order .
for al @-@ A@@ br@@ i , a security deposit of $ 5000 was fixed ( $ 13@@ ,000 ) and was released from prison on 22 August 2016 .
the Court of App@@ eal told Al @-@ A@@ br@@ i in a hearing on 26 December 2016 , but Al @-@ Ha@@ j sentenced him to six months in prison for a year and Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari .
al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari was released on 10 April 2017 after his six @-@ month prison sentence from the central prison in Mas@@ k@@ at . al @-@ Ha@@ j is still in prison where he served his annual prison sentence .
the App@@ eals Court also highlighted the decision of the Ministry of Information to close the &quot; Az@@ am@@ n &quot; newspaper .
despite the decision of the Court to rel@@ inqu@@ ish Az@@ am@@ n , the newspaper still faces attacks by the Turkish government .
on 8 January , the Minister of Information issued an order to extend the closing of &quot; Az@@ am@@ n &quot; for three months .
on 8 May 2017 , the Minister of Information personally signed another order in which the closing of &quot; Az@@ am@@ n &quot; was extended by three additional months , and with which the minister once again decided against the decision of the Court of App@@ eal to re @-@ publish the publication of the newspaper .
the ongoing closure of Az@@ am@@ n and the attacks on journalists from the newspaper aren &apos;t the only cases in which the press freedom in Oman has been injured in recent times .
further injuries include closing the website of the independent magazine M@@ ow@@ atin and exercising pressure on Al@@ bal@@ ad , the first independent online newspaper of the country to halt its operation .
due to the ongoing closure of Az@@ am@@ n and the arrest of the journalist Al @-@ Ha@@ j , the impression is that the om@@ anic authorities are still un@@ willing to put an end to the extensive violation of the freedom of the press .
the Gulf Centre for Human Rights ( Gulf Centre for Human Rights , G@@ CH@@ R ) calls on the Austrian authorities to :
1 . release You@@ se@@ f Al @-@ Ha@@ j immediately and un@@ condition@@ ally ;
2. to create a secure environment for the newspaper Az@@ am@@ n , so that their journalists can pursue their work ;
3. to protect the freedom of the press in the country and
4 . to ensure that human rights def@@ enders and journalists in Oman can exercise their legitimate human rights work un@@ hin@@ dered and without fear of ret@@ ali@@ ation , including judicial ch@@ ic@@ anes .
the Gulf Centre for Human Rights ( G@@ CH@@ R ) is an independent , non @-@ profit and non @-@ governmental organization that supports human rights def@@ enders ( also independent journalists , blo@@ ggers , lawyers , etc . ) in the Gulf region and adjacent states by promoting freedom of expression and freedom of association and the right to peac@@ efully assemble , support and protect them .

medical research in Africa : opportunities and mis@@ understand@@ ings
Ran@@ j@@ it War@@ rier 2016 in Zambia , picture taken with his consent
medical research in Africa is rarely mentioned or even mentioned in the media . this is a growing area addressing one of the most urgent needs of the continent .
there are two reasons for the need for medical research carried out on @-@ site : on the one hand , many medicines and vacc@@ ines that cover the special medical need on the African continent are missing in the offer of the global healthcare industry .
diseases such as AIDS , tuber@@ cu@@ lo@@ sis and mal@@ aria have far more grave consequences in the poor@@ est countries of Africa than elsewhere , and lack of investment in the research of these diseases by the pharmaceutical companies is a major problem .
second , research carried out by African scientists is helping establish their own research capacities in Africa . a major role of science and technology can only be con@@ duci@@ ve to the economic growth of the continent .
Dr. Ran@@ j@@ it War@@ rier is Director of the Centre for Inf@@ ectious Disease in Zambia ( Centre for Inf@@ ectious Disease Research in Zambia , CI@@ DR@@ Z ) .
he grew up in Lus@@ aka , Zambia in the 1990s , when the AIDS epide@@ mic showed first serious effects on national health .
he left Zambia for studying in the United States , initially in Lou@@ isi@@ ana , later in Indi@@ ana .
as a post@@ doc at the University of Pennsylvania he asked himself the HIV virus before he decided to go back home in order to support the Sam@@ bic health system .
with Global Vo@@ ices , Dr. War@@ rier discussed the future of medical research in Zambia and about mis@@ understand@@ ings of the media about this research .
( disc@@ la@@ imer : Dr. War@@ rier speaks as a private person ) .
global Vo@@ ices ( GM ) : what is your research topic ?
Ran@@ j@@ it War@@ rier RW : at the moment , the focus of my work lies on the application of research results . I support the sam@@ bian national program for anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy ( ART ) with laboratory tests .
I am also a research program for the development of molecular diagnostic tests for HIV , TB and other relevant patho@@ gens .
GM : what do you think are the important current scientific topics in your country and in general in Africa ?
how do they differ from those in Western countries ?
RW : there is no basic research here . we only implement solutions that have been developed elsewhere .
this has to change , otherwise we will always remain recipient instead of being a creator .
the solutions we get are often not very suitable in our environment , and sometimes it is even impossible to use them here .
GM : where does funding and support come from ?
is it sufficient ?
how easy or difficult is it to find suitable scientists for the projects ?
RW : from the USA and Europe .
the projects are well funded .
it is difficult to find people who want to come back or move here because funding and development opportunities are better in other countries .
GM : what is the research infrastructure ?
which obstacles are there in your routine research work you did not before ?
RW : the basic infrastructure does not meet the standards in developed countries . it costs a lot of money , a continuous supply of electricity , water and internet .
laboratory material is expensive , and it takes months to import it from other countries .
GM : what is the opinion of the public about science and scientists in Africa ?
RW : there is an interest , but only a very limited understanding of scientific methods .
I would suggest that critical thinking and scientific methods should be taught in schools to improve the situation .
GM : how big is your opinion about the potential of scientific research in Africa , what should they focus on , and how can we support the development ?
RW : the potential is amazing .
I have seen great students of all ages .
there is need for special academic training , starting at any age .
the social sciences , computer science , big data , exploration of space , healthcare ( non @-@ transfer@@ able and infectious diseases ) and the efficiency of traditional medicine will benefit greatly from this .
GM : can you describe the pro@@ s and cons of life as a scientist in Africa vs. Western countries based on your experience ?
RW : often it is the limited speed to do things , and the difficult access to scientific expertise that poses challenges here .
the system that periodic@@ als make articles accessible only against payment ( the so @-@ called Pay@@ wall ) limits the amount of information available and the speed of research .
from the USA to India : how &quot; Open Source &quot; seed producers change global food production
this article by Rachel C@@ ern@@ an@@ sky was originally published on En@@ si@@ a.com website , a magazine about solutions for environmental problems worldwide .
Frank Mor@@ ton has been breeding a salad in the USA since the 1980s .
its company offers 114 varieties such as Out@@ red@@ dish , the first plant that has been grown and consumed by NASA a@@ stron@@ au@@ ts in space .
for almost 20 years , Mor@@ ton &apos;s work was limited only by his own imagination and the question how many types of salads he can get .
but at the beginning of the 200@@ 0s , he realized that more and more salads were patented and that he could not use them further for breeding .
the patents are not only for individual varieties , but also for certain properties , such as resistance to diseases , a special red or green tone or cur@@ led leaves .
in recent years , more and more such patents have been registered to more and more plants such as cer@@ eal or cardboard . due to these trends , plant bree@@ ders , environ@@ ment@@ alists and experts for food security are concerned about the future of food production .
as a passionate representative of a mill@@ en@@ nia @-@ old tradition , Mor@@ ton still breeds let@@ tu@@ ce , but now it takes longer , because his work becomes more and more difficult due to more and more restrictions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is as if there is a b@@ oul@@ der in a river that I have to bring in . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
so we have to do it now , but it &apos;s a break with the breeding tradition , &quot; he says . &quot; I think these patents go too far on salads .
and if they stand in court , no one can breed a new type of salad , because all the features are already patented . &quot;
however , he is very careful and endeav@@ ours not to use any material that is protected as intellectual property .
he also joined a movement growing in the U.S. and all over the world : open Source Bre@@ eding ( &quot; Open Source &quot; breeding ) .
a@@ stron@@ au@@ ts of the International Space Station ISS have bred red red@@ dish sal@@ at of the Out@@ red@@ dish variety in the &quot; greenhouse &quot; of the station and eaten . there , it is tested whether plants can be grown in space .

it is no coinci@@ dence that this name sounds like the movement from the IT area and not from the field of plant breeding .
the Open Source Se@@ ed Initiative ( initiative for open source seeds ) is inspired by the movement for free open source software that provides alternatives to copy@@ righ@@ ted software .
it has been launched to ensure that some plant species and genes are not protected as intellectual property and thus can be used permanently for plant bree@@ ders .
as part of the initiative , called O@@ ss@@ i , US bree@@ ders can commit themselves to the fact that others can use the seeds bred by them freely .
however , this does not mean that they cannot continue to do business with their seeds and sell it . &quot; open source &quot; bree@@ ders only allow others who buy their seeds to breed their own varieties and do not immediately sow - two aspects that are banned or prescribed by many plant patents .
dozens of bree@@ ders and seed companies have already joined the initiative since their launch in 2014 .
glo@@ omy prospects
for the Emer@@ itus Professor at the University of Wisconsin @-@ Ma@@ dison and O@@ ss@@ i board member Jack Klo@@ pp@@ enburg , control of the seeds and the possibility of breeding new plants are important for food security and environmental protection .
seeds play a role in larger contexts such as biodiversity , farmers &apos; rights , control over the food system and use of chemicals in agriculture . independent bree@@ ders would try to use the latter not or only little by breeding seeds with natural resistance .
Klo@@ pp@@ enburg stresses that the &quot; open @-@ source &quot; movement does not deal with genetically modified plants .
all kinds of plants could be patented , whether vegetables , corn , genetically modified or not , from ecological agriculture or not . &quot; in order to achieve our goal of ecological sustainability , we need control over seed , whose recent examples are the mer@@ ges of Chem@@ China and Syn@@ gent@@ a and Mon@@ san@@ to and Bayer , which are offered in farmers markets for example , should also know that the way this vegetables is bred is threatened .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; food sovereignty without seed sovereignty is not possible . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the members of the Open Source Se@@ ed Initiative are committed to ensuring that their seeds remain freely available to others . in contrast , their approach is to patent seed and plant characteristics .
photo of Jack Klo@@ pp@@ enburg .
O@@ ss@@ i supporters argue that the future of food supply is at risk , as the available gene pool is constantly shr@@ inking due to the increasingly numerous intellectual property rights on plant material that is thus always available .
Cla@@ ire Lu@@ by , executive director of O@@ ss@@ i , has engaged in her doctoral thesis with genetic variation in car@@ rots and their availability . she found out that about a third of all car@@ rot characteristics are protected as intellectual property , making it difficult for plant bree@@ ders either not at all or difficult to use .
for other plants , there are no such estimates , but experts like Lu@@ by suggest that mass grown plants such as wheat are patented in even greater style than let@@ tu@@ ce or car@@ rots .
a question of view
plants are bred in such a way that they exhibit specifically desired tra@@ its - from those through which their taste or colour improves to those , due to which they prosp@@ er in certain environments and maintain threats such as p@@ ests or diseases .
opponents of patents on plant properties point out that the available plant material for bree@@ ders is decreasing due to more and more patents . however , genetic diversity is more necessary than ever since changing conditions are much worse due to climate change .
in an e @-@ mail Mon@@ san@@ to @-@ Spe@@ aker Car@@ ly S@@ ca@@ du@@ to recognis@@ es that genetic diversity is generally important and also crucial for Mon@@ san@@ to &apos;s activities . with a total of four gene banks and cooperation with institutions such as the United States Ministry of Agriculture , the company is committed to maintaining genetic diversity .
it contradic@@ ts , however , that intellectual property may restrict other bree@@ ders , as &quot; patents and the protection of plant vari@@ etal innovations promote innovation . &quot; &quot; a patent is basically a plan that everyone can follow as soon as the patent has expi@@ red .
often these instructions help others to get the same result with another method .
such protection thus does not inhi@@ bit innovation , but promotes it by providing more material and know @-@ how to the public . &quot;
Mor@@ ton sees this differently : 20 years wait for a patent to run , certainly not promoting innovation .
and if you have to wait so long to grow in plants adapted to changing environmental conditions , you have already lost the fight .
but the main argument for Mor@@ ton is that genetic resources have always been a general good and should continue to remain : &quot; independent plant bree@@ ders have neither time nor money for such form@@ alities , and monetary incentives are not attractive to us .
we want to make farmers work easier .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is what drives us and it is impossible for us to continue to use the best and newest genetic resources . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in total , Mor@@ ton interfer@@ es with the concept of pat@@ enting plant features : &quot; we don &apos;t really create the characteristics themselves .
the plants form them themselves and as bree@@ ders we finally have no idea how the plants do that .
a mystery of nature . &quot;
for C@@ aro@@ l Dep@@ pe , plant bree@@ der in the US state Oregon and O@@ ss@@ i board member , there is another important aspect of plant breeding : &quot; who breeds a variety , also breeds its own values into it .
those who believe in industrial agriculture with large farms and mon@@ oc@@ ul@@ tures , for whose cultivation it is necessary to produce mass her@@ bi@@ cides , breeds in its varieties this concept of agriculture .
my concept is exactly opposite . &quot;
while some medium @-@ sized companies ( such , which move on international markets , but smaller than for example Mon@@ san@@ to ) , they create most of the smaller seed companies to survive even without patents - either they reject the patent or they hold it for too expensive and therefore not profitable or both is the case .
the independent plant bree@@ der Frank Mor@@ ton looks for Sal@@ ate in his breeding garden .
photo by Karen Mor@@ ton .
Mor@@ ton is also the opinion that bree@@ ders would be more innovative by avoiding plant patents : &quot; it looks like I am stronger with my efforts to produce something new , stronger than a company that patented .
I constantly need new material for my catalogue , since I know that my competitors will sell my grades in a few years , &quot; he says . &quot; with a patent , one is protected from competition for 20 years , which makes it really easy for me to do . &quot; worldwide response
while the US seems to be the leader in Open Source breeding , the concept is spreading rapidly around the world .
in India , the Centre for Sustainable Agriculture ( &quot; Centre for Sustainable Agriculture &quot; ) , which describes itself as a professional organization in the field of resources , works together with farmers and helps them to breed new varieties that meet specific requirements .
it also supports them to come to open source seeds and sell their own .
the German Organization Agre@@ col is working on an open @-@ source license which is ultimately a formal and legally binding form of O@@ ss@@ i @-@ Com@@ mit@@ ment for bree@@ ders in the European Union .
( regulations for breeding distinguish themselves from country to country , so the O@@ ss@@ i obligation cannot be easily taken over one in Europe or other parts of the world . )
at the beginning of November 2016 , the Executive of the European Union , the European Commission , declared that conven@@ tionally bred plants should not be pat@@ ent@@ able . thus , it speaks against the current practice of the European Patent Office , which permits patents on conven@@ tionally bred plants .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , an explanation is not a law ; now it is up to the governments of the Member States to bring the patent office to implement this new line . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in October 2016 , the Dutch organisation Hi@@ v@@ os organized a conference on &quot; Open Source &quot; seed systems in Ethiopia , on the farmers , operators of seed banks and representatives of governments , non @-@ governmental organizations , and seed companies from all East Africa to learn about the &quot; Open Source &quot; seed movement and the worldwide trend to patents seeds .
Willy Dou@@ ma , responsible for Hi@@ v@@ os &apos;s program for open source seed systems , explains that the organization is currently building a global alliance for open source seed systems , which will be the official start of the official launch next year .
a merger of environmental protection and development aid groups ( including Hi@@ v@@ os , the international non @-@ profit development aid organisation US@@ C Canada and the action group on erosion , technology and concentration ) have put together a database on seed and biodiversity in the world to publish the Se@@ ed Map Project , a seed map .
in September , the Global Alliance for the Future of Food , the global alliance for the future of food , has published a report on aid organisations such as the W@@ K Kel@@ log@@ g Foundation , the Mc@@ Knight Foundation and others . it believes farmers must have the opportunity to come to seed , exchange and improve seed policy , so that a stable supply of food can be ensured .
the report also emphas@@ ises the importance of a diverse , local supply of seeds for sustainable food systems - a connection from which Lu@@ by of O@@ ss@@ i hopes that soon more people will see him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the movement for regional and ecological foods has largely taken care of where and how something is grown , and seed systems have hardly played a role here , &quot; said Lu@@ by . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are now trying to make it clear to people that there is even more behind their food . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

the Ukrainian Wikipedia has chosen the eleven best photographers in the national part of the International Photo Competition &quot; Wi@@ ki Lo@@ ves Earth , &quot; where the focus is on nature monuments and nature reserves .
the award ceremony took place on 7 October 2017 at the Museum of Natural Sciences in Kiev , where the winning photographs were presented in an exhibition .
in the month of May , the Ukrainian part of the international competition received over 15,000 photos with more than 1,@@ 8@@ 60 pictures on the subject of natural heritage .
about one thousand of these pictures are already used in Wikipedia articles , which are published in different languages .

all winners received certificates as souvenirs and other prizes such as souvenirs with the competition logo or vou@@ chers for online shops .
the authors of the 11 photos with the highest jury evaluations as well as competitors , who photograph@@ ed most objects and collected most points in the overall score , were honored with prizes .
other awards were awarded by other organizations that joined the competition .
for example , the employees of the nature park Holo@@ si@@ iv@@ sky@@ i , located in the metrop@@ olitan region Kiev , have selected the three best photos taken in the park and submitted for the competition .
in addition , there were also a number of special categories in the national competition : &quot; un@@ pleasant Discovery , &quot; which documents the destruction of natural habitats , initiated by NGOs from the environment sector , an overview of topics , while photos on Wikipedia lack@@ ed the best wildlife photos and best Kiev photo

human rights organisation and blog are the newest aims of cens@@ orship in Egypt
the Egyptian authorities still lock content on the Internet .
this time it met the website of a human rights organisation and the blog of a colum@@ n@@ ist .
on the weekend of 5 August the Egyptian government blocked the website of the Arabic Network for Human Rights Information ( AN@@ HR@@ I ) , which documents human rights violations in Egypt and the Arab world and reports about it .
in August , the network published an opinion on Facebook , in which it sharply critici@@ zed the Egyptian authorities for this step and promised to continue the work and efforts for human rights in the region .
the Arabic Network for Human Rights Information abi@@ des in spite of this attack and the ridi@@ cu@@ le of the Egyptian law and the constitution by the authorities who are actually defending the law to pursue the freedom of expression and human rights in the Arab world . even though it has never been so difficult to pursue these goals , it has never been as important as now .
AN@@ HR@@ I is considered the first cens@@ ored website of a human rights organization in Egypt after the authorities blocked 21 websites more than two months ago , such as the independent news page M@@ ada Mas@@ r , Arab @-@ language edition of the Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post and the Qatar @-@ based network of Al J@@ az@@ e@@ era for alleged &quot; support from terrorism . &quot;
# Egypt : 1 . human rights organisation of wave of wave cross@@ ings has fallen victim . @ an@@ hr@@ i one of the main data sources for human rights in Arabic language ht@@ t@@ ps : / / t.@@ co / NI@@ Z@@ m@@ Op@@ DS@@ 5@@ K
in addition to AN@@ HR@@ I , the blog of colum@@ n@@ ist and human rights researcher , Ah@@ med Gam@@ al Zi@@ ada , has no access to Egypt anymore .
Zi@@ ada took advantage of his blog for the dis@@ semination of columns and articles , which he writes for non @-@ accessible websites and media for Egypt .
now the blog , which he set up to b@@ ypass the cens@@ orship of the Egyptian government , became the target of an attack .
blo@@ gger , the provider who is also home to Zi@@ adas &apos;s blog , is still accessible .
Zi@@ ada , a former photo@@ journalist , spent nearly 500 days in prison after being arrested by Egyptian security forces in December 2013 , while he reported on the student protests and recorded a video on how police exercised physical violence against two students .
his articles revol@@ ve mainly around politics and the human rights situation in Egypt .
in a Facebook comment , Zi@@ ada spoke to the government by the government and reflected what this meant for him :
the blo@@ gs to lock is very old , but has priority in the era of Ab@@ del@@ fat@@ tah al @-@ S@@ isi ; and even if the blo@@ gging of the blo@@ gs may not be significant for the world , it is for me for two reasons :
1 ) It has been able to convey to me the feeling of a state of siege ; An attempted murder , attempted murder , sum@@ m@@ ons at the National Security Council , the block@@ age blo@@ gs as well as any other website I worked for .
2 ) They have proven that I did not write in vain . in other words : my words have influence , al@@ beit only to a small audience .
I would like to mention that this blog was an archive for me .
first , I used it to post articles to circum@@ vent cens@@ orship .
but now after they have locked him and that they are afraid of words , I can still change the link or create a second blog .
the cour@@ a@@ geous go the way to the end .
according to the Association for Freedom of Th@@ ought and Expression ( af@@ te ) Egyptian authorities blocked 133 web pages from May 24 to June 06 . this resulted in technical tests on networks of different Internet Service Provi@@ ders ( ISP ) , including orange , Vo@@ da@@ f@@ one and ET@@ IS@@ A@@ LA@@ T .
in addition , af@@ te documented the block@@ age of providers through the circum@@ vention of internet cens@@ orship and private surfing , so @-@ called Virtual Private Networks ( V@@ P@@ N@@ s )
af@@ te reported in her research :
on Monday , June 12 we noticed how the blocking of web pages that V@@ P@@ N@@ s offer began .
such practice suggests the government &apos;s intention to continue to block and filter content that the Egyptian users could have access .
the situation is further wor@@ sen@@ ed by the fact that the cens@@ orship decisions are taken behind closed doors , so that the Egyptian population has no legal basis with which to proceed in court against these acts .
now the question arises : how far is the Egyptian government ready to go with cens@@ orship and who will attack it next ?
is Rio de Jan@@ eiro in war ?
the inhabitants fight .

day after day newspapers report in Brazil with glo@@ omy head@@ lines from Rio de Jan@@ eiro , the second largest city in the country and home of numerous postcard motifs .
some of these head@@ lines are as follows :
&quot; 14 @-@ year @-@ old shot in school , &quot; &quot; Every second day , a police officer in Rio de Jan@@ eiro is murdered , &quot; &quot; Thi@@ eves rob@@ bed pharmacy with military weapons , &quot; &quot; President Tem@@ er sends 8@@ 500 soldiers of the army , nav@@ y and air af@@ ee to Rio . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the midst of the economic crisis and in a ten@@ se financial situation , the threshold of violence in 2017 in Rio reached the highest level for 10 years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Brazilian non @-@ governmental organisation Global Justice even called on the United Nations to intervene .
reports like these have become com@@ mon@@ place and this is unacceptable &amp; # 8@@ 212 ; at least find the managers of a local newspaper .
in this way , the newspaper &quot; Extra &quot; published in Rio for detailed reporting on violence in Rio published the editorial &quot; That is not normal , &quot; in which she announced to set up a new column called &quot; War in Rio . &quot;
all reports on violence in the city are now published there .
the paper explained the motives for their decision :
extra will continue to report on crimes that happen in every big city in the world such as murder , rob@@ ber@@ y , sexual crimes , etc . everything , however , devi@@ ates from the civili@@ zed standard and what happens only in Rio will be published in the &quot; War in Rio . &quot; ( ... ) This is our way to call : this is not normal !
this is the only alternative , so that as journalists we do not close our eyes to cru@@ el@@ ty .
in a four minute video shared on Facebook , Oc@@ t@@ Ã¡@@ vio Gu@@ edes , editor @-@ in @-@ chief of the newspaper , declared that this decision was not an occasion for pride but rather a sign of failure :
extra is probably the only newspaper all over the world with a war break in a country that does not recognize the war at all .
in the same video , a journalist of the newspaper explains that , according to the Institute for Internal Security , there are 8@@ 43 domains controlled by criminal organizations .
the newspaper further writes in the editorial :
we are aware that a war discourse when it is distorted can also be used to disgu@@ ise the atro@@ cities of the police who are only shooting and then asking questions .
but we defend the war based on information and the fight against corruption in the police whose aim is not the civilian population , but the economic power of the ma@@ fia and its partners .
does the term &quot; war &quot; harm more than it uses ?
in an article on the news portal The Inter@@ c@@ ept Bra@@ sil , journalist Cec@@ Ã­@@ lia Oli@@ v@@ eira is argu@@ ing that violence is a &quot; war . &quot; this is , in its opinion , a justification of the failed security policy through the media and could make it more difficult to take accoun@@ t@@ ability in the police .
this is not a war .
this is the result of corruption and poor planning - as demonstrated in the analysis of military operations in Rio itself - in combination with insufficient investment in personnel , education and a historical and compl@@ ac@@ ent negl@@ ect of public service .
as a reminder : the state of Rio de Jan@@ eiro is bigger than its capital .

den@@ ounc@@ ing Rio de Jan@@ eiro as &quot; the most violent place in Brazil , &quot; according to Cec@@ Ã­@@ lia , &quot; 22 of the 30 most violent cities in Brazil lie according to statistics from 2015 in the north and north @-@ east of the country .
none of these cities is located in Rio de Jan@@ eiro State .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if we look at the mur@@ ders per state , Rio is ranked 16 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she writes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
extra belongs to Glob@@ o , the largest media company in South America , which , as Cec@@ Ã­@@ lia stresses , has been repe@@ ating the state &apos;s security policy for years .
the establishment of the U@@ PP ( Uni@@ da@@ de de Pol@@ Ã­@@ cia P@@ aci@@ fic@@ ad@@ ora ) , a police unit established by the Federal State of Rio in 2003 , was also part of these security policy measures .
in the beginning , this actually led to a decrease of violent death cases . for some years , however , the U@@ PP was increasingly under fire after several reports of har@@ ass@@ ment and repression against the poor communities that were supposed to protect the newly created police unit .
on his Facebook page , the journalist Jo@@ Ã£o Paulo Char@@ le@@ aux quoted from one of his articles in 2010 , in which he explains why the violence in Rio is not consistent with the criteria set out by the Geneva Convention - the designation &quot; Civil War . &quot;
he writes :
in addition to legal issues , the classification of the situation in Rio as a war also involves serious consequences for the people .
for this requires the state to use resources and means typical of war . this includes penetration into the territory of a &quot; enemy , &quot; where a civilian is an un@@ sharp point in the landscape and becomes an object for &quot; coll@@ ateral damage &quot; and &quot; lost balls . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; war back or forth , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the fact is that the inhabitants of the F@@ av@@ el@@ as continue to suffer in Rio . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is a week ago that the police declared the mountain with the F@@ av@@ ela Jac@@ ar@@ zin@@ ho in order to av@@ enge the death of a polic@@ eman .
in the midst of all this violence , this incident occurred as a result of sho@@ ot@@ ings fired by the police from a helicopter .

to stay alive : besieg@@ ed Syrians learn to plant mushrooms
screen@@ shot from the advertising video .
source : Can@@ Do@@ Action
since the beginning of the Syrian revolution in 2011 and in the subsequent civil war , many Syrian cities suffer from brutal siege and block@@ ades , mainly through the Assad regime towards loyal troops .
according to Siege Watch , a joint initiative of the Peace Organisation ( PA@@ X ) and the research institute The Syria Institute , there are currently around one million Syrians in a state of siege in Damascus and surrounding , H@@ oms , Dei@@ r E@@ zz@@ or and I@@ d@@ li@@ b .
the region of East Gh@@ out@@ a was particularly severely affected , where an attack with chemical weapons on August 21 , 2013 called for the lives of hundreds of civilians .
many governments , international organizations , and the Syrian opposition , based on investigations by the United Nations and other human rights organisations , have been committed to the massacre of the Assad regime .
since 2013 , these rebel @-@ controlled areas outside Damascus have stood under siege , which led to inhabitants of locally produced or through tunnels and control points dependent on food @-@ gra@@ ined food .
through the years of block@@ age , traditional foods such as meat have become un@@ achiev@@ able for large parts of the population .
as a counter@@ measure , a group of Syrian humanitarian hel@@ pers and ac@@ adem@@ ics teach the inhabitants of East Gh@@ out@@ as how they can plant their own mushrooms as a &quot; food @-@ saving food source . &quot;
they call themselves G@@ hi@@ ras Al@@ nah@@ da and carry out the project together with the NGO Al Ad@@ ala .
mushrooms do not belong to the traditional crops planted in Syria and are rarely part of the Syrian cuisine . however , their food quality makes them an attractive source of food for many residents of the besieg@@ ed East Gh@@ out@@ a .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the direct of the project , Ab@@ o Nab@@ il , said in front of the French news agency AF@@ P : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we chose mushroom cultivation because they have a high nutritional value , similar to meat , and because they can plant them in houses and wa@@ iters . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Dr. Ah@@ med Lei@@ la , one of the organizers , reports Global Vo@@ ices that for three years has been struggling to make this project known and expressed his relief that it is now gaining more and more awareness . &quot;
to collect money for the initiative , we use the humanitarian crowd funding platform Can@@ do in consultation with the NGO G@@ hi@@ ras Al@@ nah@@ da .
it is planned to give 125 families a knowledge of planting mushrooms , so Dr. Lei@@ la became Global Vo@@ ices .
at the time of the Constitution of this article , they have reached over 100 % of their expected target of around 12,@@ 700 â¬ , but will continue to raise funds to Can@@ do until Monday , 04 September 2017 .
the initiative depends on generators that keep the temperature stable at 25 Â° C and humidity at 80 % .
because of the fuel shortage , locally produced plastic fuels are used to supply generators with the necessary energy .
Dr. Lei@@ la said Global Vo@@ ices that they started the production of mushroom seeds from the regions before checking their quality and whether they are suitable for consumption .
then they planted a small mushroom back@@ yard in a tub . as this succeeded , they used a larger tub . and so on .
now they have designed a &quot; educational farm for the region . &quot;
since the beginning of the project and after another 3 months , they have distributed fung@@ i everywhere in Eastern Gh@@ out@@ a for free .
Dr. Lei@@ la explained that it is part of a larger movement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to teach the people mushroom for@@ ni@@ cation for various reasons &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; : break of the siege . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
provision of a new food source in the market .
dis@@ semin@@ ating a culture of self @-@ suffici@@ ency by using food lef@@ to@@ vers ( such as paper , tea , coffee , cardboard , etc ) to produce new foods .
creating new jobs especially for women who work at home .
creating new jobs for people with disabilities connected to their home .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; We hope to spread this idea throughout the world , so that our success and our fight against hunger and siege will become visible . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want our experience to inspire people in crisis areas and we can help mankind . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

Portuguese demand justice for the victims of 2017
several hundred people prot@@ ested in many district capital cities in Portugal on 21 October and demanded justice for the victims of fires ra@@ ging in the north of Portugal in the week before .
forty @-@ two people died and about 70 were injured as a result of the forest fires of 15 and 16 October . this led to the government spending the last week out of solidarity with the victims for 3 days .
fires were also registered in the Gali@@ cia region in Spain , where there were 4 dead .
it is estimated that there were more than 500 fire out@@ breaks that spread in the northern and central regions of the country and reached about 250 million hectares of forest and numerous villages .
in June , a similar tragedy oc@@ cured in Ped@@ r@@ Ã³@@ g@@ Ã£o Grande , where there were 64 deaths and more than 200 injured .
according to the European forestry surveillance system , which monitors the forest areas via satellite images , approximately 500@@ ,000 hectares of forest are burnt in Portugal alone in 2017 - an area of the size of the Lisbon district .
so that you can get a better picture of the seri@@ ousness of the situation : there is no fire in 4 districts .
all Portugal is burning in the tru@@ est sense of the word # Pra@@ y@@ For@@ Portugal - nat@@ a ( @ a _ at@@ aner ) October 15 , 2017
some of Twitter users shared images :

numerous videos are spread on the net and show images that allow better insights into the scene :
the fores@@ eeable tragedy
the target of the protests of Saturday was the demand for better preventive and fire fighting measures by the state .
people wonder@@ ed why civil protection was not able to contain the extent of the tragedy as far as possible .
Jo@@ Ã£o So@@ ver@@ al from the federal government of Portugal declared the newspaper P@@ Ãº@@ bli@@ co :
after Ped@@ r@@ Ã³@@ g@@ Ã£o , roads and villages were ev@@ acu@@ ated for anything and nothing .
this Sunday they did not do this anywhere : there are dozens of open roads surrounded by fire .
in the woods of Lei@@ ria , a similar tragedy could have happened in June , as the streets were closed very late . &quot;
in addition , building permits are questioned in locations with a high risk of fire .
a far @-@ reaching proposal on the reform of the forest , which the government had brought in after serious fires in the years 2003 and 2005 , was obj@@ ected to by the local authorities , who saw the new rules as an obstacle to investment .
&quot; the government introduced an e@@ asing of the law which allowed the construction activity to fall , if the applicant had a means of self @-@ protection - that was an open rear door , so that everything could be built , &quot; continues Jo@@ Ã£o Sor@@ val in the same article of the newspaper P@@ Ãº@@ bli@@ co .
the environment organisation Qu@@ erc@@ us pointed out that large areas with eu@@ calyp@@ tus , trees made of light @-@ flamm@@ able wood spread out , as in a vi@@ cious circle , after fires of this kind .
in addition to these problems , the website of the Civil Defence of Portugal on October 15 and 16 , when citizens were looking for information or attempted to contact their relatives , was offline .
it was a private initiative that provided the people with information : it used fo@@ g@@ os.@@ pt &apos;s own civil protection data and informed the population in real time about the location and spread of fires .
the project was launched in 2015 by the developer Jo@@ Ã£o P@@ ina to simplify the work of the fire bri@@ g@@ ade , and this fat@@ eful weekend in October was so crucial that the servers did not stand up to the ons@@ lau@@ ght of the 400@@ ,000 users who followed the fires : the website numbered more than half a million people .
even the Fo@@ under asked for help :

the Way from Afghanistan to Succ@@ ess@@ ful Entrepren@@ e@@ urs

in a night in the autumn of 1994 , the conquest of Afghanistan began by the Tali@@ ban .
two years earlier , a terrible civil war broke out between the different Mu@@ j@@ ah@@ edi@@ n group@@ ings that had defeated the short @-@ lived pro @-@ Soviet government . thus Afghanistan had become a country of terror and despair .
exactly at that time A@@ shar@@ af Bar@@ ati , a 13 @-@ year @-@ old boy , who belongs to the ethnic group of Haz@@ ara , sat in the G@@ haz@@ ni province in central Afghanistan for the last time with his family at dinner .
even though his mother didn &apos;t say it at that time , she knew she wouldn &apos;t see her son for a long time - maybe never again .
at dawn , the boy should break .
his unc@@ le would pick him up and bring him to the tu@@ gs .

Ab@@ dul Ali Maz@@ ari , leader of the He@@ z@@ b @-@ e @-@ Wah@@ dat , dominated by Haz@@ ara , had just been murdered by the Tali@@ ban and many Haz@@ ara felt un@@ protected .
the Tali@@ ban , known for their hatred for the Haz@@ ara , always came closer .
many Haz@@ ara left the country in the direction of Pakistan or Iran .
a few days after his escape , A@@ shar@@ af found himself in Pakistan .
for a few years he worked in a coal mine . the work was hard and made him ill .
then he took what was left of his little wage , and went to Iran . once again he was in a foreign country along with other refugees and dra@@ gged sacks with mortar , which were heavier than himself , in order to earn his livel@@ ihood .
at that time , as today , the lives of Afgh@@ an refugees in Iran were marked by misery and exploitation .
&quot; it was really hard , &quot; A@@ shar@@ af remembered in an interview with Global Vo@@ ices . &quot; we ( Afgh@@ an refugees ) lived in an empty building on the construction site on which we also worked .
there were no services there and no heating . we hung nylon in front of the open windows , so that we could not freeze at night . &quot;
after four years A@@ shar@@ af has left his life without documents in Iran and made himself ready for the journey to Europe .
during the dangerous crossing of the sea he suffered ship@@ wre@@ ck and str@@ anded on a small , un@@ inhabited island .
after the Greek authorities rejected his asylum application , A@@ shar@@ af came to Italy in 2002 .
some time A@@ shar@@ af was homeless , ran alone through the streets of Rome , slept in parks and went to a church that distributed food to needy people twice a day .
while it is true that Italy is a kind of second chance for rejected asylum seek@@ ers due to relatively high response rates , it is also true that the conditions that asylum seek@@ ers find in the country are cat@@ astrop@@ hic .
the human rights organisation Civil Liber@@ ties Union for Europe writes that the system suffers from a general lack of transparency .
the large majority of asylum seek@@ ers are accommod@@ ated in the more than 3000 &quot; special reception centres . &quot; these are impro@@ vised facilities in the hands of un@@ qualified and un@@ prepared personnel . &quot;
according to the Italian Law , asylum seek@@ ers can only be assigned to a reception centre if they have officially submitted an application for asylum - which can go for months after registering the asylum request .
until then , people who have no money for accommodation can either depend on the hospitality of friends or have to sleep on the street .
so it was also A@@ shar@@ af .
but his bound@@ less way of life helped A@@ shar@@ af to get rid of these conditions soon .
after having worked for several years in the construction industry , A@@ shar@@ af ta@@ sted his entire savings into the establishment of a host@@ els in Venice .
this was so good that after a while he opened a second hostel and a fast food bar .
A@@ shar@@ af Bar@@ atis &apos;s success story is now subject of the documentary &quot; Beh@@ ind Venice Luxury - a Haz@@ ara in Italy &quot; ( German : &quot; behind Venetian Luxury - a Haz@@ ara in Italy &quot; ) of the director Am@@ in Wa@@ hi@@ di .
the film was awarded the Venice City Award for the 24th time in 2017 .

the conditions for entrepreneurs in Italy - especially for non @-@ Itali@@ ans - are very difficult .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a lot of bureaucracy , high taxes and conditions for loans are just some of the obstacles . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to in@@ official estimates , about 20,000 Afgh@@ ans live in Italy .
for many of them , the country is a transitional solution on the way to other European countries .
in recent years , some Afgh@@ ans have emerged , including tail@@ ors , travel agencies , hotels and restaurants .
some Afgh@@ an restaurants were even praised in the Italian press for their excellent cuisine .
in Venice Ham@@ ed Ah@@ ma@@ di had the idea of his restaurant Orient Experience where the wa@@ iters and the kitchen staff were mostly refugees from different parts of the world .
the menu of the restaurant tells the story of their trip to Italy by the different Afgh@@ an , Iraqi , Turkish and Greek courts .
the Afgh@@ an entrepren@@ eur Ali Khan Q@@ al@@ and@@ ari opened the restaurant Peace &amp; amp ; Sp@@ ice and also behind the pizz@@ eria Kab@@ u@@ log@@ na in Bologna and a sus@@ hi restaurant in Rome are also Afgh@@ ans .
but A@@ shar@@ af@@ s targets reach far beyond the Italian restaurant industry and the retail sector and aim back to the country that he forced to leave as a teen@@ ager .
&quot; where there is a risk , there are opportunities , &quot; says A@@ shar@@ af with a smile . &quot; I want to invest in Afghanistan .
I have never forgotten my country and I cannot live happily when I know that my people are suffering .
I plan a project for farmers from the poor@@ est provinces of the country , especially for women .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they represent half of society and have to get the same opportunities as everyone else . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
A@@ shar@@ af also forged plans for the opening of a factory in Kab@@ ul , where people can learn packaging and preservation techniques . &quot; so they can sell their crop sur@@ pl@@ uses on the market and improve their financial situation , &quot; he says .
the development of a successful entrepren@@ eur was a journey through uncertainty and doubt , but at the end there is stability and prosperity .
A@@ shar@@ af has made this journey himself . now he wants to help other Afgh@@ ans in this way .

global Vo@@ ices Adv@@ oc@@ ac@@ ys N@@ eti@@ zen Report is an international snapshot showing challenges , victories and emerging trends in global Internet rights
the Egyptian parliament has reviewed a bill which fores@@ ees that users can use social media such as Twitter or Facebook only after registering with a government authority .
users must register to use social networks within six months following the successful legislative decision on the authority &apos;s website stating their full name and ID number .
those who missed this step could be sentenced to six months of imprisonment or the tri@@ g@@ gering of a penalty .
the law , which was promoted by sixty Parliament members , is currently ahead of the legislative and constitutional committee of the Parliament and is to be deb@@ ated there .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; may , another MP filed a legislative proposal , in which tough@@ er pen@@ alties would be introduced to insul@@ t the president or a senior civil servant . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
under Egyptian law , the insul@@ t of the president and state institutions is already pun@@ ish@@ able . however , under the law of law , such an act would be punished with prison and fin@@ es , so legal experts of the Tah@@ ri@@ r Institute for Middle East Policy .
should the law be passed , this may mean up to three years imprisonment for the convic@@ ted .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , this would under@@ pin a political climate in which the right to freedom of expression and freedom of assembly has been in danger for many years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a striking example is the case of the Egyptian photographer Mah@@ m@@ oud Ab@@ o Z@@ ID ( known as Sha@@ w@@ kan ) who was arrested on 13 August 2013 when he took photos of violence against demonstr@@ ators who demonstrated against the military coup that led to the inauguration of the elected president Mohamed Mor@@ si .
Sha@@ w@@ kan was expecting more than 700 protest participants , who were arrested in the same incident , four years in jail for a court appointment .
recently , his trial was postpon@@ ed to 20 May , because the prison management failed to arrest the def@@ end@@ ants from prison in the cour@@ t@@ room according to human rights groups .
Sha@@ w@@ kan threat@@ ens the death penalty on the basis of one , so many human rights groups agree , apparent pollution of among others arms , illegal assembly , murder and attempted murder .
in another case , a criminal tri@@ bunal in G@@ iz@@ a spoke the two journalists H@@ any Sal@@ ah @-@ el @-@ De@@ en and Mos@@ ad Al @-@ Bar@@ b@@ ary . they were indic@@ ted for their reporting on pro @-@ Mor@@ si &apos;s seat block at Rab@@ a &apos;@@ a Al @-@ A@@ da@@ wi@@ ya square in Cairo .
the court also reduced the pun@@ ish@@ ments of the journalists Abdul@@ lah al @-@ Fak@@ h@@ any , Sam@@ hi Must@@ afa , and Mohamed al @-@ Ad@@ ly , who were also arrested in the previous case , from 25 years to 5 years .
Tunisi@@ an activ@@ ist listening to le@@ aked documents
may Tunisi@@ an authorities spent six hours ques@@ tioning the inter@@ ro@@ gation of Sam@@ i Ben G@@ har@@ bia , the co @-@ founder of the independent media platform Na@@ wa@@ at and the Global Vo@@ ices Adv@@ oc@@ acy Project .
Ben G@@ har@@ bia was basically inter@@ ro@@ gated to a le@@ aked action plan . ob@@ s@@ essed plan comes from the President of the Republic who , according to the plan , endor@@ sed a controversial bill of law that would guarantee business people and during the former regime by dict@@ ator Z@@ ine el @-@ Abi@@ dine Ben Ali of corruption .
the document published on 21 April on the website of Na@@ wa@@ at sheds light on how the presidential plans look for the support of the bill .
Ben G@@ har@@ bia rejected the nam@@ ing of his sources , specifying Article 11 of the Tunisi@@ an Press Code , granting journalists the right to protect their sources .
nevertheless he appeared in the district court in Tunis on 0@@ 9th May as a witness in the event .
does China want to force users of social media to present their badge ?
according to new provisions of the Office of Information Office of the People &apos;s Republic of China , the users of social media in China require permission before they write or share news in social media .
the regulations also indicate that registration with the full real name will be required .
analysts assume that the elimination of anonymous comments should be achieved in conversations within social networks . it is still unclear how the authorities will apply these regulations .
Chinese citizens have proposed in the social media to impose these regulations only sel@@ ectively in order to protect citizen journ@@ alism and its independence .
then do we see ourselves in &quot; We@@ Chat &quot; ?
not in Russia !
in May the state cens@@ orship of Russia blocked the access to the latest Chinese mess@@ aging app We@@ Chat .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to Ros@@ com@@ n@@ ad@@ z@@ or , We@@ Chat neglected to register as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; organis@@ er of the distribution of information &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this designation is part of a law from 2014 , thanks to which the Russian government carries a list of online services that organize the &quot; publication of the information . &quot; the law also allows the government to make said services responsible for removing contents and to force them on request to susp@@ end user data .
these websites are currently sites such as V@@ contacts and Od@@ no@@ Classi@@ ni@@ ki ( Russia &apos;s two popular social networks ) , the image board 2.@@ ch@@ .@@ h@@ k , e @-@ mail service mail@@ .@@ R@@ u and dozens of other services .
Turkish court decre@@ es Wiki@@ pedi@@ as
a Turkish court had the Wiki@@ pedi@@ as blocking in Turkey after Wikipedia Administr@@ ators refused to er@@ ase two English @-@ language articles , the information Turkey supports the jihadi@@ sts in Syria .
the Turkish Ministry of Transport , Maritime Affairs and Communication announced that the site was closed because it was &quot; a source of information that co @-@ operates with groups in order to make a political diffusion campaign against Turkey . &quot;
it is the first time that Turkey is blocking its website completely . it is thus , in addition to China , one of the few countries worldwide , in which access to Wikipedia is not possible .
Britain cannot stop puff@@ ing up
after this week of le@@ aked documents , the UK government finds itself in the midst of a targeted consultation with regard to increased surveillance powers that would force Internet service providers to monitor communication in real time and to install Backdoor programs that dec@@ r@@ yp@@ t data encryption .
the government has consul@@ ted telecommunic@@ ation companies and intelligence agencies regarding the proposal , but has left other technology companies and the civilian population outside .
despite all this , the consultation continues until May 19 . reactions and proposals by members of the public can be forwarded to the Ministry of the Interior .
