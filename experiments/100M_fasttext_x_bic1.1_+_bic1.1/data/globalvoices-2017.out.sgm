<seg id="1">Although I had visited the USA at least once a year since 2012, I would now live there for the first time.</seg>
<seg id="2">And that was very exciting for me.</seg>
<seg id="3">My love for America is exceptionally great.</seg>
<seg id="4">Like many of my generation, I also grew up with American movies, danced to American music, read American authors and operated his sport.</seg>
<seg id="5">In fact, this country had such a profound effect on me that I became a journalist mainly because of an American film.</seg>
<seg id="6">As a 14-year-old, I saw the great Denzel Washington, as he played the Gray Grantham in The Pelican letter, a fearless reporter who covered the murderous conspiracy of an oil-magnate with the help of Julia Roberts, who wanted to occupy the top federal court with judges who were inclined to his interest.</seg>
<seg id="7">I was trapped.</seg>
<seg id="8">Free to Method Man, "I was, as if it was the absolute truth, forget everything else, that's what I want to do with my life."</seg>
<seg id="9">And the year I lived in Arizona had only increased my admiration for the US.</seg>
<seg id="10">I always said: "America is the only country I've ever lived, whose diversity is so inviting that you can always be who you are and it is easy to find acceptance in a community of like-minded people.</seg>
<seg id="11">I even had written a very blackish love letter about his greatness.</seg>
<seg id="12">Then Donald Trump came.</seg>
<seg id="13">Much was written about the xenophobia and racism of this man.</seg>
<seg id="14">The most extraordinary aspect of his ascension is for me, how he deals with his narrow-mindedness.</seg>
<seg id="15">He never stays behind the mountain with his opinion, as he says so beautifully.</seg>
<seg id="16">He says exactly what he thinks, as a former colleague puts it, and openly declares his contempt for Muslims, Latinos, Afro-Americans and women.</seg>
<seg id="17">Nevertheless, people responded to his statements and voted for him in droves.</seg>
<seg id="18">The 13 million votes he gained in the Republican primaries was the highest number ever reached by the nominee nominee.</seg>
<seg id="19">I was speechless.</seg>
<seg id="20">Who are the Americans who support this bigoted person, I asked myself?</seg>
<seg id="21">I could not harmonize Trump and his voters with the people I had met in Phoenix during my time.</seg>
<seg id="22">Like my professor, Dr. Bill Silcock, director of the journalism programme, who receives people from all over the world, a deeply believing man with whom I could talk about Islam and his past.</seg>
<seg id="23">Trumps Weltanschauung also agreed not with Peter Bhatia, the current editor of the "Cincinnati Inquirer."</seg>
<seg id="24">Bhatia and I met with our shared love for basketball and we spent many hours watching the "Phoenix Suns" at the game.</seg>
<seg id="25">Trumps Intolerance is also in stark contrast to the generosity I experienced at Sandy Bahr, who struggled for the environment for her life, and her husband Dave, my host family, who treated me like her son.</seg>
<seg id="26">She still adapts to the commitment of Kristi Kappes, who always helped me with a lot of patience and grace and helped my colleagues to get used to the complexity of American life.</seg>
<seg id="27">Then there were Andrew gooey, Kathryn McManus and Retha Hill, my mentors whose wise counsel helped me a lot in my career.</seg>
<seg id="28">These people and the values embodied by them deepened my love for America.</seg>
<seg id="29">While Trump took his way to the nominated Republican presidential candidate, she offered me a stop and the counterpart to America's limited vision.</seg>
<seg id="30">It turned out, however, that they were the exception of the rule.</seg>
<seg id="31">On November 8, 2016, over 50 million Americans, mostly White, had the presidency of a man, despite - or perhaps because of his contempt against non-white people.</seg>
<seg id="32">The argument with the idea that people voted for Trump because they shared their racism and fanaticism or because they were willing to overlook those things broke my heart almost.</seg>
<seg id="33">Perhaps it is unfair to call the Trump voters as racists.</seg>
<seg id="34">To categorize people, said one of my friends, is exactly what led us to this situation.</seg>
<seg id="35">This is superficial and disrespectful, and indicates an inability to understand those who act and think differently.</seg>
<seg id="36">It shows people that their concerns and fears about the hectic changes in their communities are not taken into account.</seg>
<seg id="37">Could it be that these voters, most of whom know, have voted for Trump because they want to regain control of a country that they have disappointed?</seg>
<seg id="38">In other words, they might say they are still important in this America?</seg>
<seg id="39">Maybe. maybe.</seg>
<seg id="40">However, one can hardly forget the words of David Remnick, who comments the cruel decision to raise a man who looks down with contempt on those who look different from him.</seg>
<seg id="41">This "Whitelash" (note): as much as "whites against all the other ethnicities"; white and whiplash word play in white and whiplash, as the big Van Jones mentioned, has killed exactly what America has made so great.</seg>
<seg id="42">Millions of people around the world appreciate the American ideal - regardless of whether myth or reality, it is nevertheless a powerful idea - which belief or background one may always have, America welcomes everyone.</seg>
<seg id="43">For this country chose as its president, twice the son of a Kenyan, whose history, as he says himself, nowhere else in the world would be possible.</seg>
<seg id="44">With the choice of Donald Trumps, however, a huge portion of the White America promises this promise and says: to hell with diversity, freedom of religion and the whole concept of pluralism.</seg>
<seg id="45">In America after 9 / 11 the white man is back at the helm, they say.</seg>
<seg id="46">In all this I have to think of Khizr Khan, the father of a soldier who has fallen in Iraq, and what he said on the eve of the election.</seg>
<seg id="47">On a demonstration for Hillary Clinton Mr. Khan had a word change with the crowd.</seg>
<seg id="48">"Donald Trump, would my son, Captain Humayun Kahn, have a place in your America?" asked Mr. Khan.</seg>
<seg id="49">"" "" "" "the crowd answered with a loud" "" "" "" "No!" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="50">"would Muslims have a place in your America?"</seg>
<seg id="51">"no!" the crowd roared.</seg>
<seg id="52">"did Latinos have a place in your America?"</seg>
<seg id="53">"no!" they answered.</seg>
<seg id="54">Do Afro-Americans have a place in your America? "</seg>
<seg id="55">"no!" they cried and their voices louder.</seg>
<seg id="56">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "would anyone who is not like you have a place in your America?" "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="57">"" "" "" "he received a unanimous and loudly" "" "" "" "NO" "" "" "" "!" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="58">Mr. Khan concluded with the words: "thank God, Mr. Trump, this is not your America." 36 hours later he was corrected.</seg>
<seg id="59">The land for which his son fell, sent him a message.</seg>
<seg id="60">That's now Trumps Land, said the message.</seg>
<seg id="61">And all the people who look like Mr. Khan could not find a place in this new America.</seg>
<seg id="62">And this breaks my heart.</seg>

<seg id="69">What does the Mexican music school of the Vicente Guerrero community have in common in the province of Oaxaca with the children of the Paraguaan city of Cateura?</seg>
<seg id="70">That the music played at both places not only changed the life of the children, but also a very close connection with...</seg>
<seg id="71">Music that lives with the waste</seg>
<seg id="72">Vicente Guerrero is located on the edge of a large landfill, only 16 kilometers south of Oaxaca & # 8212; an old colonial town that is very popular among tourists but worlds apart from the nearby pre-Columbian ruins and its world-famous cuisine.</seg>
<seg id="73">For several years now La banda de Música (music band) has been playing in the congregation: a symphony orchestra consisting of children and adults, which has found a way to overcome the surrounding poverty with their musical instruments.</seg>
<seg id="74">A music school with 100 pupils has become a central concern for the community of Vicente Guerrero in Oaxaca.</seg>
<seg id="75">The British newspaper The Guardian wrote about this project:</seg>
<seg id="76">The community, located in one of Mexico's poorest provinces, is known for its abuse of drugs and banker violence.</seg>
<seg id="77">But after a coincidental encounter with a French pilot, who started a musical project and thus offered the youth a rare glimmer of hope.</seg>
<seg id="78">The young band members take their commitments to the music group very seriously, writes the local press Noticias Oaxaca NVI:</seg>
<seg id="79">As soon as they come out of school, they run back home and immediately after lunch they run through the dusty streets to pursue their great passion.</seg>
<seg id="80">They always come laughing and playing with glittering eyes and play in the hustle and bustle and play trumpet, trombone, piccolo, clarinet, oboe, flute, french horn, timpani, bongos and the conga.</seg>
<seg id="81">Music from garbage</seg>
<seg id="82">More than 7,000 kilometers south of Vicente Guerrero, the children of Cateura are playing a village that is practically at the top of the largest garbage dump of Asunción in Paraguay's capital - on instruments made of recycled waste material:</seg>
<seg id="83">Music with reprocessed instruments made of local solid waste materials, manufactured in a workshop for musical instruments in Cateurura, where the recyclers have begun to turn parts of waste into instruments under the leadership of Favio Chávez.</seg>
<seg id="84">The instruments imitate violins, violas, cellos, double bass, guitars, flutes, saxophones, trumpets, trombones and percussion, all of which were produced out of the rubbish.</seg>
<seg id="85">The repertoire includes classical music, folk music, paraguayan and Latin American music as well as music from the Beatles, from Frank Sinatra, etc.</seg>
<seg id="86">In an article by the Los Angeles Times, Favio Chávez, a local ecologist and musician of the children of Cateura, recalls at the beginning:</seg>
<seg id="87">First it was very difficult because we had no room for rehearsals and we had to teach at the same place where the parents worked in the garbage. the children knew no music and it was very difficult to contact the parents because many of them do not live together with their children.</seg>
<seg id="88">This changed when Favio was shown something he had never seen before: a trash made of trash.</seg>
<seg id="89">Today there is a whole orchestra that plays on instruments of reprocessed material and called The Recycled Orchestra.</seg>
<seg id="90">A documentation called "Landfill Harmonic" (Harmonic garbage dump) records the musical performance:</seg>
<seg id="91">The world generates approximately one billion tons of waste each year.</seg>
<seg id="92">Those who live with him and from him are the poorest - like the people in Cateura, Paraguay.</seg>
<seg id="93">And here they transform it into something beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="94">Landfill Harmonic follows the orchestra with its inspiring spectacle of trash-to-music around the world.</seg>
<seg id="95">The orchestra even performed his music before Pope Francis:</seg>

<seg id="98">This post, written by Emma Bryce, was originally published at Ensia.com, a magazine that specifically reports on international, practical solutions for environmental problems.</seg>
<seg id="99">The re-publication happens within the framework of an agreement with Global Voices for shared use of content.</seg>
<seg id="100">In West Africa, at that time, it was known that this ship had already operated illegal fishing in the waters of Liberian waters before the other coast of Africa visited it.</seg>
<seg id="101">The East African countries were thus correspondingly raised and little inclined to welcome a criminal of this species to their coasts.</seg>
<seg id="102">Kenya, Tanzania, Mauritius, the Comoros, Mozambique and the Seychelles were quickly mobilized against the ship. they refused to join one of their ports and refused to give him permission to fishing.</seg>
<seg id="103">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "suddenly the prime minister was surrounded by countries who simply refused everything," "" "" "" "remembers Benedict Kiilu, a senior employee of the Kenyan fishing authority. he is part of a team that discovered and pursued the ship at that time." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="104">In 2013, the ship was then driven out of the waters of the region: it didn't manage to catch fish there.</seg>
<seg id="105">Finally, it was also forced to pay 2 million US dollars to Liberia, due to the plundering of the country's fish stocks.</seg>
<seg id="106">The core of this initiative, which crosses criminal practices and protects resources, was FISH-i Africa: a network of countries founded in 2012 by the NGO Stop Illegal Fishing (Illegal Fisheries).</seg>
<seg id="107">In addition to Somalia and Madagascar, the members of this network are the six countries that the prime minister had driven out of their waters at that time.</seg>
<seg id="108">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "with this we have eight countries that are like-minded and working together." "" "" "" "they exchange information and stand at each other where it comes to illegal fishing," "" "" "" "says Tony Long, Head of the Pew Charitable Trust Project Ending Illegal Fishing. this project offers FISH-i technical support." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="109">Illegal fishing is unregulated by definition: what is caught is hidden, so it is extremely difficult to detect. thus illegal fishing is a major cause of overfishing of regions.</seg>
<seg id="110">The deliberate disrespect of existing laws by which certain habitats and species should be protected may harm the illegal fishing ecosystems that have a delicate balance.</seg>
<seg id="111">But while actions against illegal fishing were once hampered by bureaucratic hurdles and also by the snail empo, which curated information between individual countries, the actions happen today in real time, with traceable on FISH-i's digital communications platform.</seg>
<seg id="112">For example, the individual countries can exchange lists of existing licenses, news about suspicious activities or details that were noticed or experienced during port inspection.</seg>
<seg id="113">Fish-i also attentively tracks the activities of ships when they move on the open sea via satellite data.</seg>
<seg id="114">This allows the authorities to identify ships that fish in forbidden areas. such suspicious routes can also be discovered - such as those that indicate that a ship charges its caught fish on the move to other ships.</seg>
<seg id="115">Ideally, such investigations can show whether the participating ships have a fishing license, where they were on the way and possibly also whether they have a criminal-gister.</seg>
<seg id="116">Countries that are against illegal fishing may refuse to accept such ships in their ports on the basis of this information, which means that ships cannot sell their cargo. and that they can even be forced to pay penalties, as in the case of prime minister.</seg>
<seg id="117">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "then there is considerable financial losses for the owner, which means that illegal fishing is not profitable any more." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="118">And that is what we want to achieve, "says Per Erik Bergh, Chief Executive Director of NFDS Africa. the latter is a consulting firm engaged in the fight against illegal fishing in Africa and also supports FISH-i.</seg>
<seg id="119">A closed front</seg>
<seg id="120">The aforementioned platform was created to recover estimated 20 million USD in lost revenue, which the eight members of the HISH-i network lose each year because of the illegal fishermen entering East African waters.</seg>
<seg id="121">East Africa has one of the most productive tuna fisheries, which is why the region attracts commercial fishing from all over the world.</seg>
<seg id="122">Among them are actions such as sailing under false flag, fake licences, indication of fantasy names, fishing of protected species and fishing in nature reserves.</seg>
<seg id="123">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "in the past, a ship was able to fish illegally and a country could say" "" "" "" "You may not attack my port" "" "" "". "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="124">Yet another country could say 'Come to me'. 'and exactly this legal loophole tries to close FISH-i now.</seg>
<seg id="125">Until now, the closed front is working.</seg>
<seg id="126">Since its inception, FISH-i has been involved in more than 30 studies of suspicious vessels.</seg>
<seg id="127">It has uncovered criminal networks that had spread fake licences in Tanzania. it discovered ships that used several fraudulent identities and it has tracked and found refugees fleeing.</seg>
<seg id="128">Due to its collaboration with INTERPOL, the international authorities for combating crimes, FISH-i can share information on illegal fishing across large distances.</seg>
<seg id="129">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "some of our investigations lead us quite far into the networks of organized crime," "" "" "" "says Bergh." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="130">He builds a system that will help FISH-i to locate suspicious vessels more precisely.</seg>
<seg id="131">Photo courtesy of FISH-i Africa.</seg>
<seg id="132">Fish-i's satellite system, which is constantly evolving, helps to track the illegal vessels that love to hide.</seg>
<seg id="133">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "the illegal fishermen use very sophisticated techniques to hide their activities and their position." "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "Duncan Copeland, chief analyst at Trygg Mat Tracking, a NGO that also deals with fishery data and offers FISH-i technical support." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="134">Some of the ships, for example, switch off their automatic identification systems, so they can no longer be ordered by satellites.</seg>
<seg id="135">Copeland is therefore helping build a system that connects different levels of information. FISH-i is supposed to help find criminals with greater precision.</seg>
<seg id="136">A model program</seg>
<seg id="137">But can FISH-i's team of African nations actually influence the undoubtedly global problem of illegal fishing?</seg>
<seg id="138">John Amos, President of the NRO SkyTruth, believes this.</seg>
<seg id="139">Recently, SkyTruth has opened the Global Fishing Watch platform together with Google and the Marine Protection Organization Oceana: a platform that provides satellite data to display the position of each individual trackable ship worldwide.</seg>

<seg id="142">There are signs that FISH-i's activities do not only detect criminals but also deter them.</seg>
<seg id="143">Ships that had been fished without a license earlier and hardly expected to have consequences now know that they are being watched.</seg>
<seg id="144">According to Kiilu, some of the countries involved in FISH-i now have a 33% increase in fishery sales, since fishing boats buy more licenses.</seg>
<seg id="145">After FISH-i Somalia had helped Somalia to track down Greko 1, the inspectors found onboard towing nets for their use.</seg>
<seg id="146">Photo courtesy of FISH-i Africa.</seg>
<seg id="147">Other countries also notice these successes. "the effect is so strong that we now also copy other countries," says Kiilu. "we are a study object." in West Africa several hundred million dollars disappear every year through illegal fishing.</seg>
<seg id="148">In 2015, six countries have joined forces, to the so-called West Africa Task Force. they are now also fighting illegal fishing, according to the same model as FISH-i. "Security is the aim of creating even more such initiatives and structures in other regions," says Copeland.</seg>
<seg id="149">Recently, FISH-i's latest member country Somalia was able to announce its first big triumph: in October, there was Greko 1, a ship that was under a false flag. and not only was the ship on its way without a license and were used towing nets that are now banned.</seg>
<seg id="150">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "with the taking of measures against Greko 1," "" "" "" "they set a strong signal against illegal fishing," "" "" "" "says Bergh." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="153">The road movements in Venezuela seem to be only the beginning of a wave of violent demonstrations.</seg>
<seg id="154">They are considered a protest against the government's decision to stop the referendum on the removal of President Nicolás Maduro.</seg>

<seg id="157">After the Government of Venezuela rejected the request of the opposition to a referendum, the Venezuelans reacted in whose eyes the negotiations on the political and economic crisis of the country ran into the void by gathering on the streets.</seg>
<seg id="158">Under the hashtag # LaTomaDeVenezuela (about: the regulator of Venezuela) you can find both pictures of these demonstrations and arguments for and against them.</seg>
<seg id="159">The debate is also conducted in other parts of the country - including in the lowland area of Barinas, in the Andes-regions Mérida and Táchira, in the centrally-north-lying federal state of Carabobo and on Isla Margarita in the state of Nueva Esparta.</seg>
<seg id="160">The political and economic situation of the country is worsening continuously, which is reflected in the daily life of the Venezuelans by an acute lack of food and medicines.</seg>
<seg id="161">Many representatives of the opposition saw in the dismissal of the current President Nicolás Maduro the chance of a fundamental change; in the end, however, the deposition of a new election was blocked by the official authorities.</seg>
<seg id="162">Marianne Díaz, Contributors at Global Voices in Venezuela, summarises in her latest article the context of the government decision as follows:</seg>
<seg id="163">As part of the social, political and economic crisis, where inflation and violence are among the highest in the world (the inflation rate is estimated at 500% at the end of the year) and in which a grave and widespread lack of food and medicine, the referendum was considered the only way to give the country a chance to regain its institutional structures and to close a new government alliance.</seg>
<seg id="164">The electoral alliance Mesa de la Unidad Democrática or short MUD (about: round table of the Democratic Unit), in which the opposition parties and political groups joined forces, urged the demonstrators to join the National Assembly on 27 October. in addition, a twelve-hour strike on the following day and a march to the Miraflores Palace, the Venezuelan government, were scheduled to continue to persist.</seg>
<seg id="165">The call was commented on Twitter, among other things, as follows:</seg>
<seg id="166">It is as far as Venezuela: tomorrow National Assembly, Friday nationwide civil war and on November 3 all go to Caracas to the Miraflores Palace.</seg>

<seg id="171">The pictures of the marches published in real time testify among other things an overwhelming participation of the people in numerous areas of the country, but also clashes with policemen as well as supporters of the government.</seg>

<seg id="178">There the demonstrators went back to the local cathedral to protect themselves according to their own testimony in front of the police and armed supporters of the government.</seg>
<seg id="179">Hours later they could safely leave the cathedral, but the protests continued.</seg>
<seg id="180">In other parts of the country some demonstrators tried to stop the police forces, including this woman in the Andean State Táchira:</seg>
<seg id="181">The women in Táchira don't wear skirts because you could see something that many national gardists don't have!</seg>
<seg id="182">Meanwhile, an infographic already makes a round which forms the extent of suppression per day:</seg>
<seg id="183">Thus the dictatorship has suppressed the country.</seg>
<seg id="184">Many representatives of the government had questioned the validity of the demand for a public prohibition procedure - this has now been proven in the eyes of many by the presence of countless people on the streets.</seg>

<seg id="197">This is an adapted version of an interview by Alejo Gómez with Luis Quijano, which was published on 23 August 2016 at Día a Día, an Argentine news site.</seg>
<seg id="198">The interview was translated into English and published here with kind permission.</seg>
<seg id="199">When he was 15 years old, Luis Alberto Quijano was forced by his father to watch the atrocities in La Perla, a secret prison in the Argentinian city of Córdoba.</seg>
<seg id="200">As an adult man, Quijano now said in the context of the great La Perla-Ribera process in the province of Córdoba against his father.</seg>
<seg id="201">In the trial, which ended on 24 August 2016, crimes committed during the Argentinean military dictatorship were examined.</seg>
<seg id="202">Luis Alberto Quijano hasn't chosen his life.</seg>
<seg id="203">Beginning with the burden of carrying the same name as his father until the brutal military operations in the prison La Perla, which he observed at the age of 15, he suffered enough.</seg>
<seg id="204">For 34 years he kept the family secret for himself.</seg>
<seg id="205">In the situation at that time, I thought that was all right.</seg>
<seg id="206">I felt like a secret agent.</seg>
<seg id="207">As a child with 15 years, one does not notice that one is manipulated by his father.</seg>
<seg id="208">At that time I could not realize that my father was a thief, a torturer and a murderer.</seg>
<seg id="209">Luis Alberto did not have a choice: his father Luis Alberto Quijano was a police officer. during the Argentinean military dictatorship from 1974 to 1983, a time of state terrorism, his father was Deputy Commander of the Intelligence Department 141 in La Perla prison from 1976 to 1978.</seg>
<seg id="210">Luis Alberto Quijano.</seg>
<seg id="211">Archive recording.</seg>
<seg id="212">But this is not the story of Luis Quijano, the oppressor who is accused of kidnapping in 158 cases, torture, murder in almost 100 cases and kidnapping of a 10-year-old child.</seg>
<seg id="213">No, this is the story of Luis Quixanos's son, a man who, over the years, recognized the extent of atrocities he had experienced as a boy, and who testified before a Federal Constitutional Court against his own father.</seg>
<seg id="214">His story shows what great power a parent has over his child and how this child chose for himself a path of salvation.</seg>
<seg id="215">From the sports hall to the military base</seg>
<seg id="216">When my father started to take me to the military base, I often went to the sports hall with us. there I had friends with a boy who made martial arts.</seg>
<seg id="217">Everyone named him "Kent."</seg>
<seg id="218">I told my father about him and a few days later he showed me a black and white photo and asked me to identify my friend on it.</seg>
<seg id="219">He said:</seg>
<seg id="220">You are an asshole, you have been friends with one of the ERP.</seg>
<seg id="221">Keep up that they don't take you one day and I have to save you.</seg>
<seg id="222">The abbreviation ERP is for Ejército Revolucionario del Pueblo, a revolutionary People's Army - the military arm of Argentina's Revolutionary Workers Party.</seg>
<seg id="223">Therefore he forbade me to go back to the sports hall. a few days later, he took me to work on the military base.</seg>
<seg id="224">"" "" "" "he told me that I would be a secret agent." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="225">I was 15 years old and in the situation I thought that would be fine, because my father had educated me.</seg>
<seg id="226">At the base of the military base I had to crush the papers that had listened to the prisoners.</seg>
<seg id="227">These were all kinds of documents: university degrees, handwritten notes, literature, certificates, propaganda materials, books, just everything.</seg>

<seg id="229">'There the prisoners are tortured '</seg>
<seg id="230">My father took me four times to La Perla with everything in 1976.</seg>
<seg id="231">At the first and last time, he let me wait at the entrance in the car.</seg>
<seg id="232">When he took me the second time, he ordered me to go out. he led me to a barracks, in the cars, furniture, TV, fridges - simply everything possible - stood.</seg>
<seg id="233">Everything was stolen.</seg>
<seg id="234">He gave me a small packet wrapped in a blanket and ordered me to carry it to the car. when I opened it, I saw that there was a big clump of silver inside.</seg>
<seg id="235">That day I went to the other end of the barracks where the stolen items were shut down and kept me with a guard.</seg>
<seg id="236">Suddenly he pointed to an open space and said:</seg>
<seg id="237">The prisoners are tortured.</seg>
<seg id="238">I sewed in and saw a couch where people were tortured.</seg>
<seg id="239">It looked like a field bed and metal springs.</seg>
<seg id="240">Later I found out that they attached the one end of a cable. the other end was attached to the body of the person who was tied just there.</seg>
<seg id="241">They seldom held a man with handcuffs to the bed, poured it out with water and chased him a charge of 220 volts to the genitals.</seg>
<seg id="242">Photo: Comisión Provincial de la Memoria</seg>
<seg id="243">The stench there was horrible... like a dirty Windel.</seg>
<seg id="244">Years later, when my father was under house arrest, the same smell came out of his room.</seg>
<seg id="245">I realized the smell immediately and I realized that the smell of a body is in need.</seg>

<seg id="249">When my father took me to work for the third time, he led me to the entrance of La Cuadra - the area where the prisoners were chained and bound up with handcuffs.</seg>
<seg id="250">He spoke with "Chubi" Lopez (Jose López, a civilian who was also charged in the trial) and took the opportunity to take a look at La Cuadra.</seg>
<seg id="251">In the background I saw a number of mattresses on which naked people were facing the face down - all were tied at hands and feet.</seg>
<seg id="252">In the vicinity of the entrance, people quit still on the mattresses.</seg>

<seg id="262">The path on which you came here is also the path on which the abductions came here.</seg>

<seg id="264">Here their names were changed and they were assigned a number as part of the process of dehumanisation.</seg>
<seg id="265">When they survived the torture, the prisoners were thrown into the cuadra until the order from above came to be postponed.</seg>

<seg id="269">At that time at age I had no idea what the "booty" - as they called it - was.</seg>
<seg id="270">But when I was myself in the military, I was in the gendarmerie - it became clear to me that war booty is a bayonet or perhaps military separatists, which you have fought against an enemy you fought.</seg>

<seg id="276">I just don't understand it.</seg>
<seg id="277">I was also an officer in the gendarmerie and I would never have liked to enter a house and steal all of it.</seg>

<seg id="288">At that time the Defence accused me of being a conspirator of this crime. I replied, no problem, they can put me under the burden of what they wanted.</seg>

<seg id="347">In the Japanese city of Kyoto, customers of a newly opened centre in which one can have his driving licence extended, in the last month witnesses of a particularly miserable translation.</seg>
<seg id="348">The Japanese word was written on a sign for the fact that the "older motorist" means, wrongly, but also with a malicious hind Thank & # 8212; as "awful drivers."</seg>
<seg id="349">The wrong translation was to be read from 1 to 20 September on electronic ads in the entrance area and in the building itself.</seg>
<seg id="350">Editing the original photos by Joshua Levine, which has been widely shared in the social media.</seg>
<seg id="351">The mistake was noticed by the translator Julian Holmes, a resident of Kyotos. he was also aware of the local newspapers.</seg>
<seg id="352">The Kyoto Shimbun newspaper published in Kyoto wrote:</seg>
<seg id="353">"how could it come to such an English translation?</seg>
<seg id="354">This proves that no one has read the translation correction.</seg>
<seg id="355">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "this is an insult to elderly people and in an international city as Kyoto is simply unacceptable," "" "" "" "said Holmes." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="356">The miserroneous English translation was initially removed. the term "terrible drivers" was later replaced by the more appropriate, although grammatically not quite correct term "elder drivers" (German: "older drivers").</seg>
<seg id="357">The police of the Kyoto prefecture apologized for the translation error. furthermore, she explained that the error was already contained in the text they had received from the translator and that the translation was not checked for their accuracy before publishing it.</seg>
<seg id="358">A blogger told us about the apologies as follows:</seg>
<seg id="359">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "we are really sorry that elderly people felt offended by the inadequate correction of our part," "" "" "" "said the police." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="360">The Japanese online news service J-Cast News dealt with the phenomenon of "awful" older drivers in Japan and wrote:</seg>
<seg id="361">The word "awful" was denounced as an inappropriate description of older motorists. according to the police, the proportion of older drivers involved in accidents, however, is quite a cause of concern.</seg>
<seg id="362">In the Kyoto prefecture, for example, in 2005 1,941 of total 19,460 accidents were caused by seniors. this corresponds to a share of 10%.</seg>
<seg id="363">Ten years later, in 2014, seniors took 1,803 out of a total of 11,850 accidents.</seg>
<seg id="364">This increased its share to 17.7%.</seg>
<seg id="365">While the number of accidents has decreased overall, the proportion of accidents caused by seniors has increased in the same period.</seg>
<seg id="366">The above-mentioned reporter gave comments to the light published on Yahoo in the article published on Yahoo, which show what prejudices some Japanese have apparently against older drivers:</seg>
<seg id="367">The article on Yahoo about the translation error received among other things the following comments:</seg>
<seg id="368">- "Is this not reality?"</seg>

<seg id="376">The reasons for the wide spread of translation errors are manifold.</seg>
<seg id="377">To translate, you need two important skills: passive language skills to understand the source text and to apply active language skills to transfer it to the target language.</seg>
<seg id="378">The latter requires the active domination of the target language - something that is the case with native speakers. generally, the conviction that translators should be in the target language - not in the initial language - should be native speakers.</seg>
<seg id="379">For example, a French native speaker should translate into French for example - not from French to English.</seg>
<seg id="380">Photo by Flickr user Karl Baron.</seg>
<seg id="381">Many Japanese companies do not employ English as their native language, which could translate translations into English. this may be due to lack of understanding of translation, cost reasons or the relatively small number of English native speakers who learn Japanese.</seg>
<seg id="382">Some companies, who do not have foreign employees, can still produce translations within the company. then the Japanese employee, whose English knowledge is assessed as the best, is made a translator - no matter how good or bad his language skills are.</seg>
<seg id="383">Photo by Flickr user Karl Baron.</seg>
<seg id="384">Machine translation is also widely used - often with funny results.</seg>
<seg id="385">The proverbs and puzzling sentences that arise through machine translation show that this technique can't replace a human translator for a long time. this is especially true for some languages.</seg>
<seg id="386">Some of the strangest English phrases in Japan, including the puzzling prints that often adorn t-shirts or bags, are only used for stylistic reasons - not to be read or even understood.</seg>
<seg id="387">Photo by Flickr user Joseph Brent.</seg>
<seg id="388">Translation errors may be acceptable or at least harmless as jewelry. but from large companies or from the government who have the means to ensure higher standards, more careful translations can be expected.</seg>
<seg id="389">In the future, the city of Kyoto will hopefully use a reputable source for its translations.</seg>

<seg id="391">Main page of the portal "Navegar of Libertad" (Free Surfing) of the IPYS (Instituto Prensa y Sociedad, Institute for Press and Society).</seg>
<seg id="392">On Friday morning, April 7, Venezuelan Internet users reported that they had no access to the Vivoplay online transmitter.</seg>
<seg id="393">Later, other users wrote that the internet appearances of VPITV and El Capitolio TV are no longer accessible.</seg>
<seg id="394">Other online broadcasters also recorded recordings of the protests in Caracas, organized by opposition groups opposing the government of Nicolás Maduros.</seg>
<seg id="395">The protests began at the beginning of April, after the Supreme Court disbanded the Parliament and transferred the Parliament's tasks to the executive and the Supreme Court itself.</seg>
<seg id="396">Luis Carlos Díaz, journalist and author at Global Voices, published the results of a traceroutes. he pointed out that the connection was appended and recommended the users to use VPN (virtual private networks) to access the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="397"># censorship: enabled your VPN.</seg>
<seg id="398">It seems that Internet pages of Venezuelan providers are again blocked.</seg>
<seg id="399">This is from the @ VivoPlayNet site.</seg>
<seg id="400">Offers such as Vivoplay are popular among the Venezuelans with Internet access, especially in times of unrest.</seg>
<seg id="401">Traditional media have been hesitant in reporting about protests since 2014. at that time, the Commission for Telecommunications threatened them with fines and closures if they continue to report on the demonstrations, as the Commission saw this as a "call to violence."</seg>
<seg id="402">Without cable TV and informative national TV channels, I have registered again at @ vivoplaynet.</seg>
<seg id="403">It's amazing that this is still cheaper than buying two litres of lemonade.</seg>
<seg id="404">The local NGO VEinfiltrated later confirmed that not only Vivoplay was inaccessible by blocking the Domain Name System (DNS), but also two other online channels. this also applies to the Internet site at which the National Assembly transmits its sessions.</seg>
<seg id="405">Previous research by the Institute for Press and Society (IPYS), a research group for digital rights in Venezuela, revealed that the local Internet providers sometimes use DNS. this is a technique by which the DNS servers answer requests for certain domains.</seg>
<seg id="406">If a website is blocked by the DNS, the server responds correctly or refuses the request when calling a website.</seg>
<seg id="407">We confirm a DNS lock: @ elcapitoliotv, @ VPITV and @ vivoplaynet</seg>
<seg id="408">At VPITV, a third blocked channel, the transmission was set on Thursday April 6, when the VPITV cameraman Elvis Flores, who was transferred to Caracas live, was arrested.</seg>
<seg id="409">Flores was beaten as he was in police custody.</seg>
<seg id="410">Eight hours later he was released, and VPITV went on stream.</seg>
<seg id="411">Although some channels are still accessible via YouTube, it has also been reported that the government regulates internet connections, making access to multimedia coverage of the current events in the country more difficult.</seg>

<seg id="416">The following article is the shortened version of a report published by Global Voices with the kind permission of the authors.</seg>
<seg id="417">The article is part of a series entitled "Vacas que vuelan, Escuelas que Caen" ("Flying cows, falling schools"), edited and republished by Global Voices of Latin America.</seg>
<seg id="418">Tina Alvarenga lived for eight years in a household where she was not allowed to eat together with the family who lived there.</seg>
<seg id="419">Shortly before her graduation at the university she returned to the house and heard the owner of the house full of pride about her. "she's like a daughter for us.</seg>
<seg id="420">"" "" "" "she said," "" "" "" "she said." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="421">But Tina Alvarenga was never treated like a daughter in this house.</seg>
<seg id="422">When she was ten years old, she began to work as Criadita for the family. as Crimean, one calls in Paraguay the more than 46.000 boys and girls who are forced to work to go to school.</seg>
<seg id="423">The business is quite simple: a large family with little money hands over their minor son or their minor daughter to another, wealthier family. in exchange, the child receives food, a training and a roof over the head.</seg>
<seg id="424">However, what is not mentioned is that the children have to pay for it countless days of housework, which is never paid and victims of abuse and abuse can become - and all that is within the framework of a contract that cannot be lifted.</seg>
<seg id="425">The practice described as Criadazgo is widespread in Paraguay because of the participation and acceptance by large sections of society and despite numerous complaints by human rights organisations.</seg>
<seg id="426">After graduating, Alvarenga worked for a number of years for an organisation that fights for the rights of boys and girls.</seg>
<seg id="427">She spoke with Crimintas - especially young girls were affected by the practice of Criadazgo - collected testimonies, researched and denounced.</seg>
<seg id="428">She tried to call things by name, because the feeling of gratitude that is inoculated by the Crimean is generally not silent.</seg>
<seg id="429">"the Criadazgo is based on a double deception," explains Alvarenga.</seg>
<seg id="430">On the one hand, the family leaving their daughter in the belief that they can complete their education, improve their position in society and "make something out of themselves" is handed over to another family.</seg>
<seg id="431">On the other hand, the family that assimilates the girl and justifies the exploitation by believing that she would give someone a chance that would otherwise have no education and might even be starved.</seg>
<seg id="432">The victims of the Criadazgo</seg>
<seg id="433">When the girl is abused, his family will learn about it many years later.</seg>
<seg id="434">Sometimes they never experience it.</seg>
<seg id="435">In January 2016, the hitherto relatively unknown phenomenon, which takes place in the secret of Paraguayan households, got a face.</seg>
<seg id="436">When Carolina Marín was hospitalized in Caaguazú, her body showed traces of violent strikes. shortly thereafter she died.</seg>
<seg id="437">She was 14 years old.</seg>
<seg id="438">She was Criadita in the household of the former military officer Tomás Ferreira and his wife Ramona Melgarejo, who works as a civil servant at the registration office.</seg>
<seg id="439">Marín lived with them in their house in Vaquería, a small village with only 3,000 inhabitants 250 kilometers east of the capital Asunción.</seg>
<seg id="440">At the end of January 2016 Ferreira teamed up with a stick on Marín until she suffered fatal injuries.</seg>
<seg id="441">This should be the last punishment in the life of the young girl.</seg>
<seg id="442">A few days later, the media reported about the incident.</seg>
<seg id="443">They stressed that the murdered child was a Criminta.</seg>
<seg id="444">Organisations like UNICEF or Callescuela were responsible for the practice of Criadazgo deeply rooted in the Paraguayan society for the death of the girl.</seg>
<seg id="445">They described the Criadazgo as "a modern form of slavery."</seg>
<seg id="446">Several dozen people gathered to protest demonstrations and demanded that there would be "no other Carolina" in Paraguay.</seg>
<seg id="447">The girl's name and photos have been widely publicized in the social media.</seg>
<seg id="448">"in Paraguay more cows are registered as children," Tina Alvarenga complains.</seg>
<seg id="449">Without documents it is much easier to violate the rights of children without impunity.</seg>
<seg id="450">Without official documents it is very difficult to control under which conditions boys and girls live.</seg>
<seg id="451">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "the neighbors of the married couple and nearly 60 civil society organizations called for a quick investigation of the case." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="452">They want Tomás Ferreira and Ramona Melgarejo to be sentenced to 30 years in prison for the murder of the girl who was her Criminta.</seg>
<seg id="453">If the case comes to court, the case of Carolina Marín could be landmark - if for the first time in the history of Paraguay a case of Criadazgo comes to court.</seg>
<seg id="454">The everyday life of a cripta</seg>
<seg id="455">The Crimintas are not only exploited as labour forces, they also live isolated from other girls at their age.</seg>
<seg id="456">Tina Alvarenga was ten years old when the Farbik, in which her father worked, had to sign up bankruptcy and her father lost his work.</seg>
<seg id="457">Their brothers now had to work all the time and began selling sweets on the street or on the market to make money.</seg>
<seg id="458">But they all went further to school.</seg>
<seg id="459">Only Tina was sent to the capital Asunción as Criminta.</seg>
<seg id="460">In her employer's house, Alvarenga worked between four and six hours each day.</seg>
<seg id="461">She had to divide the time in such a way that she still had time to learn.</seg>
<seg id="462">She stood up every morning at five o'clock and prepared breakfast for her employer.</seg>
<seg id="463">Fridays, for example, cleaned the fridge, cleaned up the living room, polished the furniture and disinfected the floor.</seg>
<seg id="464">When the school was over, she went home again and had time to learn.</seg>
<seg id="465">The sooner she finished her learning, the more free she had.</seg>
<seg id="466">But also this time was limited because she had to make dinner for her employer.</seg>
<seg id="467">Alvarenga says she never had to starve, but didn't get unlimited food too. "I was allowed to bring me more books from the library of the landlord as food from the fridge," she recalls.</seg>
<seg id="468">The library was well-equipped and belonged to the landlord, a former military and sympathizers of the partido Liberal, a liberal party that belonged to the opposition during the dictatorship of Alfredo Stroessner, who was in power from 1954 to 1989.</seg>
<seg id="469">On some evenings the host of Alvarenga forced him to stand next to him and to read editorial from opposition newspapers such as "Sendero" or "El Pueblo."</seg>
<seg id="470">He tried to convince them to give no faith to the reports of the official media about the dictator's regime.</seg>
<seg id="471">"" "" "" "he considered it intelligent, but did not entertain it with her." "" "" "" "the landlord had found someone who listened to while he talked about politics," she says.</seg>
<seg id="472">"they didn't often allow me to visit my family because they felt that I would" learn "bad habits there again." they meant that Alvarenga, who belongs to the indigenous group of Guaraní, would return home to their mother tongue Guaraní.</seg>
<seg id="473">Their Lord feared that they would lose the education that they had enabled her to lose.</seg>
<seg id="474">But she was fully aware that she had paid for everything she got from them with her hard work.</seg>
<seg id="475">Even at school, Alvarenga was discriminated against. "one thing about which almost never was spoken is mobbing and harassment that cries are exposed when they go to school.</seg>
<seg id="476">Because the other children have parents, they immediately recognize that someone who has no parents is a cripta.</seg>
<seg id="477">I couldn't invite anybody to go home. I didn't have a circle of friends in the school or in the neighborhood.</seg>
<seg id="478">In my youth, in the time when friendships arise, I felt particularly clear that I belonged to no group.</seg>
<seg id="479">The isolation was the worst of all, "explains Alvarenga.</seg>

<seg id="499">Bill dictates Egyptian users social media to register with the government</seg>
<seg id="500">Image of Pixabay, modified by Global Voices.</seg>
<seg id="501">Posted in Public Domain CC0.</seg>
<seg id="502">Sixty Egyptian MPs have recently agreed to "draft legislation on the use and benefit of social networks."</seg>
<seg id="503">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "when it is adopted by Parliament, users must register social media in Egypt at a government authority to use social media including Facebook and Twitter." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="504">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "on the basis of the law, a place would be established that is in charge of granting citizens a permit to use social media." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="505">Within six months with the adoption of the law, users must register on the site of the site with their correct names and ID numbers in order to be able to use social networks.</seg>
<seg id="506">If it fails to do so, it could result in a penalty of up to six months of imprisonment or a loss of fines.</seg>
<seg id="507">The bill, which consists of six paragraphs and curses in local media including Youm7 and Egypt Independent, defines social media as "any application that runs through the Internet and is used to communicate with others by voice, video reports and text."</seg>
<seg id="508">It is not clear how the law is enforced when it is accepted as the draft does not indicate how Egyptian authorities can impose the registration. unclear is also how they should account those who do not register in the face of the fact that the Egyptian government is currently not able to guarantee regulation on the level of social media companies.</seg>
<seg id="509">Riyad Abdul Sattar, MP and promoter of the bill, told the magazine Al-Monitor, registered users received a username and password from the Ministry of Communications to get through the firewall that blocks Facebook. "</seg>
<seg id="510">This could mean that Egypt plans to build a firewall at national level around Facebook. on the basis of which it would be necessary for Egyptians to submit information about their identity to access the network.</seg>
<seg id="511">But it has not been known until now that such plans exist.</seg>
<seg id="512">Experts on site are sceptical regarding the technical feasibility of the proposal.</seg>
<seg id="513">Ramy Raoof, Senior Research Technologist (in German "senior research technologist") of the Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights (EIPR, in German "Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights"), said Global Voices:</seg>
<seg id="514">I strongly doubt the technical capacities and understanding of any authority in Egypt concerning things related to technology.</seg>
<seg id="515">In my opinion, they imagine that as they violently control physical public and private spaces it could also be done online.</seg>
<seg id="516">If I take them seriously, that means they will set up a powerful surveillance system to filter citizens who seek permission or not. and that means a crazy system to monitor people's activities and also to bring them to a court process.</seg>
<seg id="517">This is technically not realistic - but in Egypt everything is possible.</seg>
<seg id="518">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "in order to be adopted as a law, the draft must first be discussed by the Parliament and the constitutional committees before it enters the plenary debate." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="519">Whether its acceptance and enforcement is successful or not, the draft "is in line with a pro-military way of thinking in the parliament, in whose sense the control is maximised and must be ensured that no diverging narration is present on the surface," says Raoof.</seg>
<seg id="520">Last year, the MP Tamer El-Shahawy proposed a legal action against cyber crime in which a life-long prison sentence was intended for those who are found guilty of threatening "public order," and "to protest."</seg>

<seg id="524">This article by Todd Reubold was published in the original at Ensia.com, a magazine that deals with international environmental protection solutions.</seg>
<seg id="525">High up in the mountains of Kurdistan in the north east of Iraq, the Tierschützerin Hana Ahmed Raza and her team of scientists from the Non-Governmental Organization Nature Iraq are working to protect the ghostly Persian leopard.</seg>
<seg id="526">A subspecies of the larger family of leopards, who wanders through Africa and Asia, belongs to the Persian leopards (Panthera Pardus saxicolor). all in all, there are between 800 and 1,000 animals, so the International Union for Conservation of Nature. they are endangered because of poaching, the loss and fragmentation of their habitat and since they always find less booty.</seg>
<seg id="527">Why is this particular type of leopard so important?</seg>
<seg id="528">As Raza indicates in the video, "the Persian leopard is the only surviving predator in the Kurdish ecosystem," and the health and prosperity of the ecosystem also depends on a large predator.</seg>
<seg id="529">The chance to see a Persian leopard indeed in the free wilderness is low and goes against zero. as the team in the video therefore determines that they have a shot of a large cat in the camera, Raza escapes in pure joy.</seg>
<seg id="530">As a trained biologist, Raza loves to show a different side of her country, which consists not only of war and conflict.</seg>
<seg id="531">She has been involved in field studies on wildlife and educational programs in Nature Iraq for six years.</seg>
<seg id="532">Since 2013, it has also been a member of the IUCN / SSC Cat Specialist Group and advocates the establishment of protection zones for wildlife in the Kurdistan region.</seg>

<seg id="538">Six years after the tsunami: the state of things in Fukushima, Miyagi and Iwate</seg>
<seg id="539">"view from Shizugawa High School to Shizugawa, Minami Sanriku (Miyagi)."</seg>
<seg id="540">Shizugawa was destroyed by tsunami on 11 March 2011 and still occupied with reconstruction.</seg>

<seg id="544">At the beginning of March 2017, Kahoku Shimpo, the newspaper responsible for northeastern Japan, documented the progress made in the last six years to rebuild the lives of those affected by the "triple catastrophe" of March 2011. a massive earthquake, a tsunami and an atomic crash in Fukushima caused the catastrophe.</seg>
<seg id="545">The Kahoku Shimpo newspaper has its headquarters in Sendai, located in the prefecture of Miyagi. Miyagi prefecture was one of the prefectures in Japan's Northeast, which had to experience both the earthquake and the resulting tsunami.</seg>
<seg id="546">Hundreds of thousands of people from Miyagi and the neighbouring villages Fukushima and Iwate were forced to evacuate, because the tsunami had let entire coastal cities disappear from the map.</seg>
<seg id="547">For this reason, Fukushima prefecture has experienced an atomic crash, already for this reason 160 000 inhabitants had to leave their homes.</seg>
<seg id="548">The special report of the Kahoku Shimpo shows from a local point of view which progress has been achieved six years after, to rebuild the life of local residents.</seg>
<seg id="549">The detailed report of the paper includes both the Japanese rebuilding authority and the survey results of the affected persons themselves.</seg>
<seg id="550">The housing situation in Fukushima, Miyagi and Iwate</seg>
<seg id="551">The Kahoku Shimpo newspaper reported that by December 2015, a total of 77 per cent of the planned replacement houses were completed in the prefectures Fukushima, Miyagi and Iwate.</seg>
<seg id="552">Miyagi was able to see the biggest success among the three prefectures, and 80 per cent of the planned replacement houses were completed.</seg>
<seg id="553">Iwate has completed 75 per cent of such houses, whereas Fukushima forms the final light with 70 percent.</seg>
<seg id="554">Nevertheless, one still tries to resettle also six years after the catastrophe, evacuated of sheltered shelters (for the fact that it was the only way to resettle Kazetsu juutaku) in final spare-houses.</seg>
<seg id="555">After the triple catastrophe, nearly 80 000 people saw themselves forced to live in shelters.</seg>
<seg id="556">In December 2016, 360,000 people from Miyagi, Fukushima and Iwate lived in such dwellings.</seg>
<seg id="557">Almost 40 percent of the evacuation from Fukushima in 2011 still lives in emergency shelters, whereas Miyagi was more successful here. more than 75 percent of the evacuees who were living after the disaster in Behel's shelters were resettled in final houses.</seg>
<seg id="558">For Iwate the number here is 34 percent.</seg>
<seg id="559">The state of work and everyday life in the three prefectures concerned</seg>
<seg id="560">As the Kahoku Shimpo-Zeitung was able to determine, 1074 of 1100 schools, who were affected by misfortune, opened its doors until December 2016, accounting for almost 98 percent of the three prefectures schools.</seg>
<seg id="561">Six years later, it is clear that industrial reconstruction in the three prefectures is far more difficult.</seg>
<seg id="562">While nearly 100 per cent of the fishing ports in Iwate and Miyagi are now in operation, only 30 percent of the fishing ports have resumed their operation in Fukushima.</seg>
<seg id="563">The tsunami and the nuclear accident suffered extensively in the three prefectures of agrarian land.</seg>
<seg id="564">Miyagi was able to restore 93 percent of its agricultural land, with only 66 percent of farmland in Iwate and less than 50 percent of destroyed farmland in Fukushima.</seg>
<seg id="565">It is unlikely that this is only a consequence of the nuclear accident, because only 690 acres of 5400 hectares of destroyed arable land of Fukushima are located in the "nuclear barrier zone."</seg>
<seg id="566">In two of the three prefectures the tourism has recovered largely, but also here Fukushima lagged far behind.</seg>
<seg id="567">The tourist numbers in Miyagi and Iwate are up to 90 percent on the same level as before the disaster. Fukushima, on the other hand, can only exhibit 75 percent.</seg>
<seg id="568">However, the Kahoku Shimpo newspaper also reports that since the catastrophe almost half of the coastal dwellers find it difficult to earn their living.</seg>
<seg id="569">Is the native population prepared for the next major earthquake?</seg>
<seg id="570">In order to be able to determine the overall picture, the newspaper conducted numerous surveys among the local population and the evacuation. she questioned her about the state of reconstruction and also how her empathy has changed vis-à-vis the tsunami risk.</seg>
<seg id="571">In her introduction, the Kahoku Shimpo newspaper explains:</seg>
<seg id="572">The Kahoku Shimpo conducted a survey to learn more about the tsunami awareness among the local population.</seg>
<seg id="573">The survey carried out that 83.1 percent of local residents took measures to be prepared for future earthquakes and tsunamis.</seg>
<seg id="574">However, 55.9 per cent of respondents found that still not enough was done in disaster prevention.</seg>
<seg id="575">How it stands for those who had to be evacuated from the Fukushima prefecture</seg>
<seg id="576">In her issue to commemorate the anniversary of the earthquake, the Kahoku Shimpo newspaper emphasised her attention to the situation of the evacuation from Fukushima.</seg>
<seg id="577">Fukushima did not only have to experience the massive earthquake and the devastating tsunami, no, the Fukushima prefecture was also witness to the worst, disaster-induced nuclear accident that Japan ever had to experience.</seg>
<seg id="578">About 16,000 people from Fukushima were displaced in areas outside the prefecture of Fukushima.</seg>
<seg id="579">At the beginning of 2016, a little more than 23,000 people were resettled back to Fukushima, in permanent spare-houses.</seg>
<seg id="580">After the state of 2017, 40 000 inhabitants of Fukushima still live outside their home prefecture.</seg>
<seg id="581">In the disaster areas, most of the evacuees who still live in shelters are older than 50 years old. it is well known that the efforts are to compete for the reconstruction of Miyagi, Iwate and Fukushima with massive construction projects. these are construction projects that are part of the Olympic Games that will take place in Tokyo in 2020.</seg>
<seg id="582">The world is small: our podcast "Into the Deep"</seg>
<seg id="583">When people come across from other countries speaking a different language, the differences seem to be greater than the similarities.</seg>
<seg id="584">After a while, however, one often recognizes that one more links than it seems at first sight.</seg>
<seg id="585">These global connections are important as they challenge our prejudices, expand our perspectives and remind us that the world is ultimately very small.</seg>
<seg id="586">In this episode of Into the Deep, the Global Voices Podcast, we look closely at these global connections. in our Into the Deep Podcast we treat issues that get less attention in the coverage than they deserve.</seg>
<seg id="587">We speak with five Global Voices members who are remembering a moment in which they have felt very strongly connected with someone over language and country borders.</seg>
<seg id="588">Veroniki Krikoni talks about the similarities of Greek and Turkish; Tori Egherman explains how the love of music overcame the lack of common language skills during a trip in rural China; Adriana Macias talks about the time it worked with people from all over the world; and Joey Ayoub looks back on his experiences he collected in a small village in Madagascar.</seg>

<seg id="594">Right: Mateus Ferreira da Silva on a widespread photo.</seg>
<seg id="595">A Brazilian student at the age of 33 was delivered to the intensive care unit this week: last Friday, a police officer met him during a demonstration in Goiânia with a strike against the head. millions of demonstrators took part in a protest march against austerity.</seg>
<seg id="596">Mateus Ferreira da Silva, who studies social sciences at the Federal University of Goiás, has suffered a skull-brain trauma and several fractures.</seg>
<seg id="597">Doctors operated this Saturday and now transferred him to an artificial coma.</seg>
<seg id="598">Its condition is regarded as critical.</seg>
<seg id="599">The local photo journalist Luiz da Luz made photos of the attack on Mateus, which spread quickly in Brazil within a few days.</seg>
<seg id="600">On the pictures is also the face of the police officer, who attacked with a strike. the man was identified as Augusto Sampaio.</seg>
<seg id="601">After the incident, the military police announced in the Brazilian state of Goiás that Sampaio was suspended from active ministry until the investigation of the incident.</seg>
<seg id="602">The pictures show the police officers, as he strikes in Goiânia with his headstock on the face of the student Mateus Ferreira (photos: Luiz da Luz).</seg>
<seg id="603">If a police officer was beaten by a demonstrator and landed on the intensive care unit, his face would be on television for six months and the entire oppression would be justified.</seg>
<seg id="604">The Facebook page "Desneuralizador," a press channel of media activists from Goiânia, shared the video recorded by Luiz da Luz on the web in which you can see how Mateus is attacked by the police officer and several paramedics shortly thereafter hurry to him.</seg>
<seg id="605">Another video with the same scenes but filmed from a different perspective is also immersed in social networks.</seg>
<seg id="606">In the clip shown below you can see the attack on Mateus from the 50th second.</seg>
<seg id="607">For the family of Mateus, who lives in another state, Internet users have now donated 10,000 Brazilian Reais (about 2,700 euros) to cover part of the cost of medical treatment and to allow his family to stay in Goiânia while he is in hospital.</seg>
<seg id="608">"be brave, Mateus.</seg>
<seg id="609">Against police violence. "</seg>
<seg id="610">The drawing was shared several times in social networks.</seg>
<seg id="611">By: Heitor Vilela. published with permission.</seg>
<seg id="612">On Facebook, Professor Pablo Ortellado calls for further violence against activists in Goiás:</seg>
<seg id="613">Goiás experiences a wave of political violence: here the activist Guilherme Irish was murdered by his father, because he supported the Occupy movement in secondary schools. here, the military police of a WhatsApp group participated, only to criminalize teachers, and here we have attacked the very sad case of Mateus Ferreira da Silva, who was attacked by a policeman who struck him with a stroke.</seg>
<seg id="614">Police Handles</seg>
<seg id="615">Goiás was not the only state in Brazil where there was brutal police action against demonstrators last Friday.</seg>
<seg id="616">At protests in the centre of Rio de Janeiro, police officers set up a stage for speakers, rubber bullets and tear gas.</seg>
<seg id="617">The deputy, Flavio Serafini, the Social and Peace Party (PSOL), asked the police to refrain from violence against demonstrators.</seg>
<seg id="618">This includes a report in Folha de S. Paulo, one of the oldest newspapers in the country.</seg>
<seg id="619">Once again, the Brazilian media have covered street protests by focusing on another unexpected protagonist: a window pane.</seg>
<seg id="620">The Folha de S. Paulo and Estado de S. Paulo purposefully reported on a broken glass window in order to illustrate its title pages illustratively with a photo.</seg>
<seg id="621">On the other hand, O Globo preferred a cover story with a bus set on fire.</seg>
<seg id="622">There is no plausible journalistic reason to report more about a broken window screen than about the protests of thousands of people serving the defense of a special thing.</seg>
<seg id="623">You also have to acknowledge this if you are strictly opposed to any kind of damage.</seg>
<seg id="624">Here, too, the term "vandalism" gets an absurd, disproportionate importance, and the typical acts of violence by the military police are covered by headlines with the title "protesters on confrontation with the police."</seg>
<seg id="625">The Forundustralization of Forgotten Villages in Cuba</seg>
<seg id="626">With the introduction of the law of Álvaro Reynoso, almost hundreds of sugar cane factories in the whole of Cuba concluded the doors (photo: Julio Batista)</seg>
<seg id="627">The popular congregation of Gregorio Arleé Mañalich, located in the Western Cuban province of Mayabeque, is generally known as el Central - on a Spanish Sugar Mill, notwithstanding that there is no appreciable sugar crop on site.</seg>
<seg id="628">It was two years ago when the activities in the sugar cane factories were paralyzed.</seg>
<seg id="629">After the rest, the sugar cane industry remained silent in the region, and the factory gradually lost its plants until only the framework of steel and concrete remained.</seg>
<seg id="630">About 272 workers had to invent themselves.</seg>
<seg id="631">Some changed the work.</seg>
<seg id="632">Others resigned and commuting daily to the factories that are still grinding.</seg>
<seg id="633">Nene, a soldier veteran, who stands up every day at 4: 00 am, the crisis in the sugar cane industry does not deprive his sleep.</seg>
<seg id="634">It heard that there are sugar cane factories in the east of the region, which are in operation after a long period of inactive time, because they were preserved.</seg>
<seg id="635">That was something he didn't expect.</seg>
<seg id="636">Nene is sure to have heard that in Mañalich the sugar cane factory would be preserved, but the promise was not kept.</seg>
<seg id="637">The sugar cane industry has already resisted the plagues, the fall of socialism, the low market prices, inefficiency, bad administrative decisions and climate change.</seg>
<seg id="638">In 2016, production amounted to 1.6 million tonnes of sugar, less than the quantity produced in 1910.</seg>
<seg id="639">The news would have been a motive for concern for the country several decades ago, but the bad harvests are no longer a news anymore.</seg>
<seg id="640">Why was the Cuban sugar cane industry switched off?</seg>
<seg id="641">The old railway platform of the community saw even better times.</seg>
<seg id="642">(photo: Julio Batista)</seg>
<seg id="643">The reduction in the sugar cane industry was an economic necessity: the 155 sugar cane factories were technically outdated, and hardly competitive they became unbearable for the country.</seg>
<seg id="644">The initial idea was to concentrate production on the most efficient factories, the annual production target was 4 million tonnes.</seg>
<seg id="645">They only left the factories that could produce sugar for a maximum of 4 Centavos (0.03 Euro).</seg>
<seg id="646">The solution for unemployment?</seg>
<seg id="647">The motives that led to such measures were the low productivity of sugar cane plantations and the sugar crisis in the world market.</seg>
<seg id="648">Nevertheless the sugar price rose again about a decade ago.</seg>
<seg id="649">From 2017 to 2025, the price of unrefined sugar has to remain between 15 and 16 Centavos per pound, according to the report published in 2016 by the OECD and FAO, the United Nations Agricultural and Food Organisation.</seg>
<seg id="650">If current production would reach the level of 2001 (3.6 million tonnes), the raw sugar exports would generate around 85 million dollars for the country.</seg>
<seg id="651">Not everything went well</seg>
<seg id="652">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "today's day will certainly go into history," "" "" "" "these were the first words of Cuban President Fidel Castro, during his speech on 21 October 2002 at the sugar factory in Lavender." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="653">From then on the process of restructuring in the sugar industry began.</seg>
<seg id="654">In the following years, the decommissioning of a total of 98 sugar cane factories, more than 65 million people received their full salaries for further education.</seg>
<seg id="655">The same happened in the sugar cane factory Gregorio Arlée Mañalich on May 14, 2004.</seg>
<seg id="656">Luis Alberto Pérez was working in the factory since 1967.</seg>
<seg id="657">When Nene, as he is known as a soldier, talks about the closing of the factory, the word he repeats most frequently is "fraud."</seg>
<seg id="658">Almost all those questioned are in the same opinion: not one of them was informed that the factory would be shut down.</seg>
<seg id="659">In order for the place to be preserved, they constituted a full-time working group.</seg>
<seg id="660">Before the first anniversary, the first letters began to come.</seg>
<seg id="661">It was officially recorded documents that were only distinguished with regard to the parts that would be removed, the addressee and the date.</seg>
<seg id="662">All were signed by Ulises Rosales del Toro, only the Minister could approve any withdrawal.</seg>
<seg id="663">From then on the responsibility was taken and the letters came more and more frequently.</seg>
<seg id="664">Juan Carlos Rivero was responsible for the shut-down factory for two years and he was one who received the letters. "the country had no money for the sugar cane factories operating in operation," he affirms.</seg>
<seg id="665">Eddy Reyes, 64 years, awaits the retirement in another plant, the Boris Luis Santa Coloma.</seg>
<seg id="666">He was against his will in the shutdown of the factory, in whose construction he helped.</seg>

<seg id="689">First Nations young people use hip hop to express themselves and get their own culture</seg>
<seg id="690">Recording a song from "Home to Me" - Grassy Narrows First Nation.</seg>
<seg id="691">Photo used with permission of N'we Jinan.</seg>
<seg id="692">Young people of the First Nations communities across Canada deal with topics that are important to them. they do that by means of hip-hop thanks to a series of hiking workshops.</seg>
<seg id="693">As part of the N'we Jinan Tour, workshop leaders have been bringing mobile recording studios directly to schools and youth centres since 2014 to teach youth groups song writing, recording, audio and video production and live performances.</seg>
<seg id="694">The original workshops were conducted by David Hodges, who lives in Montreal and worked in North Quebec with ten Cree communities and then worked with the Cree Hip-Hop-Group The NorthStars.</seg>
<seg id="695">The workshop goes on with the fact that the young participants in talks like "cultural identity, language, debate, love, self-acceptance" or whatever comes to mind.</seg>
<seg id="696">These questions are inspiration for songs and videos in which young people are the main actors.</seg>
<seg id="697">Because the workshops were so popular, the team also collaborated with other first Nations communities in the Canadian province of British Columbia and was invited to organize similar workshops with the branch of the Winnebago in the U.S. state of Nebraska.</seg>
<seg id="698">This video of the school 'Na Aksa Gyilak' Yoo in the area of the master of the Kittotkalum First Nation in British Columbia, for example, tells the story of Highway 16, also called "Highway of tears," a street section in Westkanada, where almost two dozen mostly indigenous young women disappeared or were murdered.</seg>
<seg id="699">The cases were largely unexplained.</seg>
<seg id="700">The next video of the Nemaska Cree First Nation uses the motif of a video game to convey how important the preservation of traditional customs and customs is, despite the influence of globalisation.</seg>
<seg id="701">Many of the songs appeared in indigenous languages, although the youngsters do not always dominate the languages of the First Nations.</seg>
<seg id="702">In the following song that the Whapmagoothi Cree First Nation has recorded, the chorus is sung on Cree.</seg>
<seg id="703">The young people involved received some help from Gary Jolly from the Northstars Hip-Hop group, who gave them a verse in the Eastern James Bay Cree dialect.</seg>
<seg id="704">On the Facebook page of N'we Jinan there is a verse to the verse, as well as a translation into English translated into German:</seg>
<seg id="705">Sometimes I feel like no one ever is interested in me</seg>
<seg id="706">But I try to continue my days on Earth</seg>
<seg id="707">This is the day you will take our cry</seg>
<seg id="708">Because as a youth we have lost our way in life</seg>
<seg id="709">But I believe that we will rise one day</seg>
<seg id="710">I don't want to see how they live a bad life</seg>
<seg id="711">So they can grow and move forward as well as our youth</seg>
<seg id="712">So they can do what they intended for the Creator</seg>
<seg id="713">In the comment section, the reader and author of the Cree language Kevin Brousseau also makes a contribution and adds the verse to the syllable inscription (which is published on his blog and published here with permission):</seg>

<seg id="718">In Japan it is possible to see plastic meals in front of almost every restaurant.</seg>
<seg id="719">To show potential customers what exactly is on the menu, they are displayed near the entrance shokuhin sanpuru (some of the so-called "plastic models of the dishes") of any food served in this restaurant.</seg>
<seg id="720">Customers can see these plastic dishes and decide if they enter the restaurant or go on.</seg>
<seg id="721">There is a whole industry dedicated to the production of these plastic dishes.</seg>
<seg id="722">In the Tokyo district of Kappabashi there are a large number of small companies that produce those plastic dishes that the German filmmaker Wim Wenders documented in his film Tokyo-Ga more than 20 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="723">For most Japanese, these plastic dishes are so common that they don't even notice them. however, a new trend today turns them into showy cell phone accessories and other gadgets.</seg>
<seg id="724">The blogger itinii series of social media links and photos published by Naver Matome published this unusual twist with shokuhin sanpuru.</seg>
<seg id="725">Now in special sale: new plastic ribbons decorated with plastic ribbons, as shown in the Kichijoji Tokyu department store.</seg>
<seg id="726">Many of these artificial foods have been converted to kitschy collection objects, as in this case, fridge magnets:</seg>
<seg id="727">Here are some Shokuhin refrigerator magnets for a new exhibition at the Tokyo-Station.</seg>
<seg id="728">The new boom in food production is becoming increasingly more complex.</seg>
<seg id="729">In this case an Imperial-don (a popular rice bowl with seafood) was transformed into a mobile stand.</seg>
<seg id="730">For this triangular dish (lol) we have found a good use as a phone stand.</seg>
<seg id="731">We also made this part of the exhibition in Tokyo Station.</seg>
<seg id="732">And here is an apple that holds your cell phone:</seg>
<seg id="733">Designed to look like an apple, with a notch for the mobile phone, this is already a great design.</seg>
<seg id="734">And this is just the beginning of an increasing flight into the Comintern.</seg>
<seg id="735">Some mobile phone booths and mobile phones allow you to create your own artwork. in this case, ikura or laughscheating is used, a popular topping that is served with white rice.</seg>
<seg id="736">On Twitter, some users had doubts:</seg>
<seg id="737">"" "" "" "is there anyone who would say:" "" "" "" "wow, cool, now I can decorate my mobile phone with smiles?" "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="738">I think I will be the only one.</seg>
<seg id="739">This interest in plastic dishes can also take on a less appetizing form in order to surprise colleagues or family members unpleasant.</seg>
<seg id="740">Our latest mobile stand has the form of melting ice.</seg>
<seg id="741">In addition, there are also rice balls (Onigiri), earrings and handybands of dried salmon.</seg>
<seg id="742">Other bizarre plastic dishes can be seen at: itinii's Naver Matome blog post. or follow on Twitter the hashtag # for the little ones to be mastered.</seg>
<seg id="743">If you would like to learn more about the origin of this trend, this video gives you an insight into the district of Kappabashi, which is dedicated to supplying the restaurant industry.</seg>

<seg id="746">"for the victims of the fight against drug traffickers."</seg>

<seg id="749">In reports of domestic and foreign media about the infamous "fight against drug trafficking" in Mexico, the mischief and the killed regularly appear only in statistics. however, they do not reflect the extent of the human tragedy that this struggle entails.</seg>
<seg id="750">The report on drug bosses such as El Chapo Guzmán, the head of the Sinaloa cartel, pushed the stories of the victims of the conflict perfectly into the background.</seg>
<seg id="751">On the day after a violent incident, hardly anyone looks at the bereaved or the communities who have learned to live with the pain.</seg>
<seg id="752">Behind every body, behind every bone discovered in the hundreds of secret graves, the stories of countless parents, sons and daughters, friends and partners whose wounds may never heal.</seg>
<seg id="753">That is why the Mexican news portal Animal Político has launched the digital project "Aprender a Vivir Con El Narco" (German: "live with drug trafficking"), which will give these victims a voice and tell stories of people who are in the fight between law enforcement and cartels.</seg>
<seg id="754">Animal Político describes the project like this:</seg>
<seg id="755">Organised crime can not only be feared for our lives.</seg>
<seg id="756">The effects are far more profound.</seg>
<seg id="757">For example, when businesses close because they are threatened by drug dealers and entire communities have to drive many kilometers to buy something as simple as milk.</seg>
<seg id="758">The pain of the victims</seg>
<seg id="759">A video with the title "Vidas que Cambian por el miedo" (German: "how afraid life changes") tells exactly these stories.</seg>
<seg id="760">A main character is Guadalupe, a father who seeks secret graves after his son every weekend.</seg>
<seg id="761">Or Emma Veleta Rodríguez, who lost her father, her husband and two of her nephews on just one day.</seg>
<seg id="762">"" "" "" "priests:" "" "" "" "like every Sunday, we are preparing ourselves again today for the task that we have set before us and seek for tombs, according to the people we have loved." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="774">We don't just have to show the faces of those who are afraid. we must show the international community the conflicts, the fragility and the leadership of the state.</seg>
<seg id="775">The project is based on stories of readers and reports by journalists in high-risk areas.</seg>
<seg id="776">Here are some excerpts from the stories.</seg>
<seg id="777">KYHB, a reader of Animal Político, wrote this post from Taxco, in the state of Guerrero in central Mexico.</seg>
<seg id="778">Your contribution reminds us that violence should never be considered normal, no matter what form it occurs:</seg>
<seg id="779">I've known disease and sensationalism for several years now.</seg>
<seg id="780">I come every day to newspaper kiosks and see the pages of titles with pictures, which can only come from a textbook for criminals or from specialists from specialists.</seg>
<seg id="781">It brings me out of the frame.</seg>
<seg id="782">Sometimes I feel like I am the only one who is disgusted or sad. it works like a lack of respect for the person who once belonged to that body.</seg>
<seg id="783">I cannot be indifferent or consider this as normal.</seg>
<seg id="784">She writes on:</seg>
<seg id="785">No, it is not normal that my 10-year-old cousin thinks he wants to become Narco (German: drug dealers) if he is big. and it is also not normal that people hear songs about the "heroic" of the offenders when they go through the streets.</seg>
<seg id="786">For me it is as if they ridicule those who have lost someone and those who are afraid that something happens to them.</seg>
<seg id="787">I see our weakness when stories become mere numbers in a statistic.</seg>
<seg id="788">"" "" "" "the inaction of men is incredible when the death of six people and the disappearance of 43 students in a neighboring town will be justified by being" "" "" "" "soaked up" "" "" "". "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="789">I think they try to persuade them to remain spared from such tragedies when they are not stirring and silent.</seg>
<seg id="790">Maribel L. from Mexico City wrote the contribution "Four months blackmail in the Capital district: how a family was plundered with threats." it describes how armed criminals crush money from their business for month, until they destroyed not only the business but also tore their family apart.</seg>
<seg id="791">You are thinking of everything you have lost and how many people can completely change your life in just a few days.</seg>
<seg id="792">The pain of this never fades, the trauma remains, the fear comes up again when you are alone.</seg>
<seg id="793">Habits have changed, phone numbers also.</seg>
<seg id="794">We will contact you only if it is absolutely necessary.</seg>
<seg id="795">The farther we are from each other, the better.</seg>
<seg id="796">She closed her report with the words:</seg>
<seg id="797">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "we want the others to be arrested because you don't know when they will kidnap you or kill you." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="798">In these terrible days I asked myself whether wines would dissolve my deep-rooted feelings, but the answer is no, because I forgot how to weep. I have to learn to live with the pain.</seg>
<seg id="799">The journalist Mario Gutiérrez Vega published the post "The Forgotten Children of Ciudad Juárez: a Generation of Violence."</seg>
<seg id="800">In the introduction he raises questions like: who cares about the child of a missing woman and a man murdered by organised crime?</seg>
<seg id="801">How is it possible to grow up in a settlement at the edge of the most dangerous city of Mexico?</seg>
<seg id="802">He is not like other boys of his age, whose parents care about them.</seg>
<seg id="803">Bryan is a orphan and he tells us he had to teach himself how to cook an egg, roast potatoes, heat tortillas warm and make "Chichi" for the babies who live with him. this is his name for preparing the bottle with water, sugar and milk powder.</seg>
<seg id="804">He tells of the nine scars on his left leg - one for every age of life.</seg>
<seg id="805">But they are insignificant compared to the pain in his eyes - unspeakable for a boy for whom all life consists of violence and who had to learn to live with it.</seg>
<seg id="806">When he was five years old, he told him that his mother had disappeared.</seg>
<seg id="807">But this was not the day when his childhood had ended.</seg>
<seg id="808">His childhood was past two years before, when he was just a few blocks away from his home, the bloody corpse of his father who had been shot by armed men from a passing car.</seg>
<seg id="809">When Bryan was born, the situation in Juárez looked like this:</seg>
<seg id="810">Bryan was born in 2006 when violence was mixed by organised crime and the fight against the existing social problems in Juárez.</seg>
<seg id="811">In 2008, 2009 and 2010, Juárez was the most dangerous city in the world due to the number of murders according to the Council of Public Security and the Government of the United States Government.</seg>
<seg id="812">In 2010 alone, the public prosecutor's office was 3103 Mordes. this corresponds to 8,5 killings per day.</seg>
<seg id="813">These are just a few hundreds of thousands of stories that leave the organized crime in Mexico and penetrate into the soul of the country.</seg>
<seg id="814">Only a few stories continue to live in the face of new headlines. but this project reminds us of those we are not allowed to forget.</seg>
<seg id="815">In addition to the project "Aprender a Vivir Con El Narco," Animal Político has launched the data journalism project Narcodata whose objective is to represent the complex information behind the failed struggle against drug trafficking, which has tormented the country over the last four decades.</seg>

<seg id="818">The fact check is important at a moment when it comes to raising a rumor or exposing a fake.</seg>
<seg id="819">But how is the year after something has emerged the first time? content in social media, whether true or untrue, tends to persist.</seg>
<seg id="820">Let us take this photo of a terrible accident seven years ago in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC).</seg>
<seg id="821">Since its first release, it has been used to make tragedies that have actually occurred in Nigeria or Myanmar.</seg>
<seg id="822">This false coupling of image and event - "wrong description" or "wrong context" in the terminology of Global Voices or First Draft News - does not denies the fact that there is plenty of careful reporting about events in the DR Congo, Myanmar and Nigeria.</seg>
<seg id="823">But it raises questions about our craving for images on news.</seg>
<seg id="824">What happened in the Democratic Republic of Congo</seg>
<seg id="825">In 2010, a tank truck crossed the town of Sange in the east of the DR Congo, tilted and exploded. 230 people died.</seg>
<seg id="826">After the civil war, Africa's second-largest country had been neglected for years and thus devastated. roads in the region have become dangerous paths full of potholes which were difficult to navigate.</seg>
<seg id="827">Tragically, the tank truck fell victim to it.</seg>
<seg id="828">Official representatives described a fireball rolling dozens of houses including a cinema close to which was full of people watching the World Cup.</seg>
<seg id="829">Houses burned and carbonized bodies were scattered in the streets.</seg>
<seg id="830">Many people were burned to innocence.</seg>
<seg id="831">A picture with the title "Das is Nigeria." from the Imgur user Mystical Monkey, 12 January 2015.Several photos of the incident form the horrible scenes of this day.</seg>
<seg id="832">Above is an example of this.</seg>
<seg id="833">It shows rows of cabal bodies lined up on the floor while people look at them.</seg>
<seg id="834">But here the story does not end.</seg>
<seg id="835">Over the years, the same photo was recorded several times on social media, blogs and other platforms, wrongly attributed to real but not related tragedies, especially events in Nigeria and Myanmar.</seg>
<seg id="836">What happened in Nigeria and Myanmar</seg>
<seg id="837">On 3 January 2015, fighters of the Boko Haram attacked the remote Nigerian villages of Baga and Doro Gowon.</seg>
<seg id="838">Eye witnesses dramatically reported atrocities they had to flee.</seg>
<seg id="839">Houses and shops were burned and dead bodies were laid in streets and bushes.</seg>
<seg id="840">There were reports, according to which 150-2000 people were massacred.</seg>
<seg id="841">"" "" "" "but the figures could not be confirmed." "" "" "" "nobody stayed back to count corpses," "" "" "" "said a human rights Watch." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="842">Many had been dismembered, shot or burned.</seg>
<seg id="843">Only on the basis of satellite images the follow-up time could be depicted visually.</seg>
<seg id="844">The occasion for the attack was also unclear, but the military base in Baga was a permanent conflict between the military Nigerias and the attempt by Boko Haram to win the country (examples from 2013 and 2015).</seg>
<seg id="845">And here the picture emerged from the DR Congo, when it was wrongly presented as proof of the fact and the possible extent of the attack:</seg>
<seg id="846">This is Nigeria.</seg>
<seg id="847">A massacre of 2,000 people took place two days after Paris.</seg>
<seg id="848">They are not Charlie.</seg>
<seg id="849">They are dead.</seg>
<seg id="850">In fact, this fraudulent use of the image from the DR Congo is only one in a series of abortions; Africa Check has documented regulations on Nigeria since 2014.</seg>
<seg id="851">In all these cases, the picture was presented as a proof of mass killings.</seg>
<seg id="852">Another step further brings personal comments such as this example falsely blaming the image from the DR Congo with sources of mass media in order to deliver arguments.</seg>
<seg id="853">The picture of cheek also appeared in connection with the deadly persecution of the Muslim Rohingya in Myanmar.</seg>
<seg id="854">According to a flashing of lightning, published by the United Nations, those who were able to flee were beaten, rape and several dead, some by burning.</seg>
<seg id="855">While others reported about the violence against Rohingya, Posts showed up like the following, who brought these descriptions together with photos from the DR Congo:</seg>
<seg id="856">This picture comes from an Saudi Arabian news site, which falsely claimed President Myanmars Thein being, monks and politicians had participated in the murder of Rohingya Muslims. in addition, she had used the image from the DR Congo to portray this information.</seg>
<seg id="857">The original contribution, which was last accessed on 26 April 2017, can be accessed here.</seg>
<seg id="858">Other news organizations that called AFP as their source had also falsely attributed this statement to Thein, but they did not have the image of DR Congo related.</seg>
<seg id="859">The worldwide reach of false information</seg>
<seg id="860">Traces of this false coupling date back to 2011 and 2012 and are actually coming from all over the world.</seg>
<seg id="861">With the help of an inverted picture search, you can see how far information can cross borders.</seg>
<seg id="862">A reversed picture search with the Tinaa search engine has found 344 pictures under 18.8 billion pictures (as of May 3, 2017), which are very similar to the said picture from the DR Congo.</seg>
<seg id="863">They come from a mixed mash of private pages, social media platforms, and national and national publications and are available in many different languages such as English, Russian, Spanish, Arabic, Dutch, German, Greek and Portuguese.</seg>
<seg id="864">Some have redirected false reports, some have tried others to expose the falsifications.</seg>

<seg id="909">This news page falsely asserted that the President of Myanmar Thein had admitted his 2012 that monks and politicians were involved in killing the Rohingya Muslims and brought the story together with the picture of ange.</seg>

<seg id="912">This article from 2014 on students who were killed by the Boko Haram, published by the now deleted, Catholic near news page Análisis Digital, has expressly declared that the image does not originate from the killings, but it claims that it portrays a "similar jihadist attack."</seg>

<seg id="915">The image of DR Congo emerged with this Twitterhashtag and triggered a discussion among Muslims after the massacre of the Boko Haram 2015 and the attack on Charlie Hebdo in Paris.</seg>
<seg id="916">They wanted to achieve greater attention to these events that took place in the name of Islam.</seg>
<seg id="917">United States, 2015.</seg>
<seg id="918">The picture was weathered as evidence of the Boko Haram massacre in 2015 (and more than 9,300 times), but the messages associated with it were not taken up in any religious context.</seg>
<seg id="919">Instead, the goal was to pay attention to the relative number of deaths and a comparison of media coverage compared to Nigeria and the attack on Charlie Hebdo.</seg>

<seg id="921">After a message which was allegedly written by a "Father Juan Carlos Martos" about the Nigerian massacre, there were discussion forums such as this in Vietnamese and declared it to be false.</seg>

<seg id="927">Frames and pictures</seg>
<seg id="928">There are two strong topics or frames that pass through these posts. the first frame focuses on religion.</seg>
<seg id="929">The photo was used in relation to greater discussions on the silence related to the killings of Christians by Muslims or - to defend the Muslims - the killings of Rohingyas by Buddhists.</seg>
<seg id="930">A second framing uses the image to discuss how an African life is undervalued compared to a European or French life.</seg>
<seg id="931">To understand religion and the value of human life is both important. therefore, it is worth examining how images are used in connection with these efforts.</seg>
<seg id="932">A deeper question, however, is what happens when readers can no longer believe these images.</seg>
<seg id="933">With social media there are tens of people who inadvertently share the water around a tragedy.</seg>
<seg id="934">Suggestion this mood of misinformation and false information that actual atrocities are untrue and embellish the real horror of what has actually happened in the DR Congo, Nigeria and Myanmar?</seg>
<seg id="935">The spread of violent images has already been debated extensively (for example).</seg>
<seg id="936">One argument is that withholding images from a refusal to recognize the tragedy. sometimes these images are even demanded by the victims themselves.</seg>
<seg id="937">At the same time, the concern is that violent images are desensitizing readers and viewers and empower them to feel empathy (such as this study that examines how forcible media are working to help others).</seg>
<seg id="938">While there is a lot to discuss about violent representations in the news media, the fact is that they are indispensable for today's news reporting.</seg>
<seg id="939">Technologists are experimenting with algorithms to support the fight against "fake news." they will have to think thoroughly about the situation in which a picture suggests something, which can also be used detached from context or completely misuse.</seg>
<seg id="940">However, any investigation of false attributions should also take into account how international they can be.</seg>

<seg id="943">Photo by Andy Simmons uses CC BY-ND 2.0 license.</seg>
<seg id="944">A blog with the name untranslatable (e. g. unmissable) endeavours to offer speech enthusiasts a selection of words from around the world that are difficult or not to translate at all.</seg>
<seg id="945">There are such words in every language: they express certain situations or feelings that are often very complex or specific.</seg>
<seg id="946">Some of these irreplaceable words are already well known today (like the famous Portuguese saudade) and others deeply rooted in a special culture (for example the Spanish Sobotesa).</seg>
<seg id="947">But everyone stubbornly resists every attempt of a simple translation.</seg>
<seg id="948">One word or expression is not enough, which is why a complete explanation and sometimes some context is necessary to understand exactly what is meant by this one word.</seg>
<seg id="949">These unique words have been collected in an online list for quite a while.</seg>
<seg id="950">Most of these lists treat Japanese, German, French, Portuguese or Finnish words while the author and linguist of "untranslatable" Steven Bird decided to focus on small languages.</seg>
<seg id="951">In the blog you can find for example words from the Mwotlap language of Vanuatu, such as:</seg>
<seg id="952">"vakasteglok" - Wait for your parents in recognition of what they have done for you in your younger years.</seg>
<seg id="953">And words in the Hunsrik language spoken in parts of Brazil, such as:</seg>
<seg id="954">"kwadi" - The comfort or laziness you feel after being warmed up in the sun on cold days.</seg>
<seg id="955">In Birds' own words from his blog about:</seg>
<seg id="956">They deceive other cultures, reveal other forms of thought and awaken our curiosity.</seg>
<seg id="957">Sometimes, how we analyze the world around us and classify the linguists on this page would like to publish more of these "irreplaceable" words and show how different, valuable and impressively these small languages are.</seg>

<seg id="1016">When Jalaluddin Rumi was as old as I am now, he was an orthodox Muslim preacher and scholar.</seg>
<seg id="1017">Islam, the Koran and Prophet Muhammad were the centre of his poetry as far as the day he died.</seg>

<seg id="1024">Our politicians, the news industry and Hollywood continue to delay them.</seg>
<seg id="1025">I have been working in the news industry for thirteen years and I have seen how these powerful, flawed narratives dominate our news feeds.</seg>
<seg id="1026">This narrative overshadowed the reality that in the last three decades nine Muslim women have led their countries, while the US won't even choose their first female presidential candidate in 2016.</seg>
<seg id="1027">This narrative fails to acknowledge that if French, Muslim women are prevented from wearing their headscarf in public buildings and Saudi-Arab, Muslim women are forced by their government to cover their entire body, which is both two sides of the same coin.</seg>
<seg id="1028">A powerful group exercises its "control" on the "other."</seg>
<seg id="1029">This powerful narration weakens Muslim women who lead movements for change.</seg>
<seg id="1030">It also sees that the first Muslim prayers were spoken on American soil by Africans who had been brought here with slave ships.</seg>
<seg id="1031">It deletes the existence of Queer Muslims.</seg>
<seg id="1032">This narrative has occupied our collective imagination so deep and flawed that often Sikh men and children become the goal of anti-Muslim attacks and harassment.</seg>
<seg id="1033">Because of these stories, which we tell and because of the way in which we tell them, Islamophobia is not only fear of Islam, religion, but fear of the "other."</seg>
<seg id="1034">Among the 1.7 billion</seg>

<seg id="1125">Things that perhaps awaken memories, as in all the intersections that make up our humanity, there may be a story where someone is made to a "other."</seg>

<seg id="1130">We all need to ask ourselves why?</seg>
<seg id="1131">Why do I tell this here at this TEDx Talk 2017 in Stanford, where, however, Edward Said, the man who showed us how wars will be led and people are encircled by creating the "other" in the public imagination, was even more scientific than Stanford four decades ago.</seg>
<seg id="1132">We have to ask ourselves uncomfortable questions about the role of consciously and unconsciously doing the "other." as my girlfriend and I present in the rain during the Women's March, because the occupation is that we have no president who feeds chocolate cake while he already spills broken countries and "other man-made" people, goes far beyond the visible and invisible 1.7 billion.</seg>

<seg id="1134">Initiative for narrative art aims to preserve urban language diversity</seg>
<seg id="1135">Story telling, by Flickr user Daniele Rossi, using the CC BY-NC-ND 2.0 license.</seg>
<seg id="1136">Can there be a way to get in touch with someone here and now despite a language barrier?</seg>
<seg id="1137">For Steven Bird and Robyn Perry, founder of the Treasure Language Storytelling initiative (TLS), telling stories in their original language is a possible answer.</seg>
<seg id="1138">Global Voices reported recently about another initiative by Steven Bird, the irreplaceable blog.</seg>
<seg id="1139">Here, however, the focus of TLS is not on the written word but on the spoken word. it is an attempt to preserve and appreciate the language diversity of big cities.</seg>
<seg id="1140">In fact, in urban areas like Melbourne and Darwin in Australia or Oakland in the United States, where TLS has held events since 2015, there is a risk that small and not quite so small languages are not passed on to the children born there.</seg>
<seg id="1141">The following applies to the makers of the project:</seg>
<seg id="1142">The mass mortality of the languages of the world can be avoided if we create cities that embrace diversity - safe spaces where inhabitants don't have to forget who they are to belong.</seg>
<seg id="1143">While "listening often is connected to understanding," these events instead "aim to listen, to appreciate, to make sense."</seg>
<seg id="1144">In this format, storytellers first introduce their story in their own language and then translate or explain it in English.</seg>
<seg id="1145">Even if the participants are not professional storytellers, their dedication and representation lead to the fact that audiences are involved.</seg>
<seg id="1146">They cry out laughing and emotion, as if the language is no longer a barrier.</seg>
<seg id="1147">The following video shows, for example, a traditional story from Burkina Faso, which is told in the language of Dafing. during this round, the storyteller Rassidatou Konate also takes the opportunity to explain the typical customs of narrative art for her country.</seg>
<seg id="1148">In another event John Nyamus tells the fist of the hare and the baboon in the language Shona from Zimbabwe:</seg>
<seg id="1149">After explaining the meaning of his fist John Nyamus is asked: "how do you speak to an audience that doesn't understand your language?" with a broad smile, he shares his feeling of inclusion:</seg>
<seg id="1150">You listened to it!</seg>
<seg id="1151">They were attentive...</seg>
<seg id="1152">They were all with me!</seg>
<seg id="1153">So far the events of Treasure Language Storytelling have taken place in three cities, and the organizers hope to extend this. all who are inspired by the project can contact TLS to organize their own storytelling shows.</seg>

<seg id="1155">With the objective of reviewing the public debt of Puerto Rico, which amounts to 72 million US dollars, various religious and bourgeois organizations took part in a mass demonstration on 3 April 2017; the march started in Capitol, the government building of the capital, and went down to Plaza de Colón in the old town of San Juan.</seg>

<seg id="1182">The Syrian-Palestinian web developer Bassel Khartabil, also known as Bassel Safadi, is missing for over a year.</seg>
<seg id="1183">But he is not forgotten.</seg>
<seg id="1184">More than five years after being arrested by the Syrian regime, his supporters and relatives continue the campaign for his freedom and recall the contributions he has made for an open network.</seg>
<seg id="1185">At this year's re: Publica, the annual conference on digital culture that is held in Berlin, an event dedicated to the # FreeBassel campaign was dedicated to this event.</seg>
<seg id="1186">Mélanie Dulong de Rosnay, a scientist of the CNRS Institute for Communication Sciences, and Barbara Rühling, Managing Director of Book Sprints, a publisher of books completed by so-called 'Book Sprints' within three to five days, read excerpts from the book Cost of Freedom: a Collective Inquiry (The cost of freedom: a collective research).</seg>
<seg id="1187">The book, which was published last year and is available free of charge, contains a number of articles dealing with free culture in the face of oppression.</seg>
<seg id="1188">It is a tribute to Bassel and his work.</seg>
<seg id="1189">In the introduction it means:</seg>
<seg id="1190">This book would like to discuss how movements are built for free knowledge and what are the real costs associated with it.</seg>
<seg id="1191">Activists, artists, designers, developers, researchers and authors who are involved in the movements for Free Knowledge have worked side by side to look beyond the fog that surrounds our newsfeeds and to create some sense from our various experiences.</seg>
<seg id="1192">This book is an attempt to free Bassel Khartabil, the beloved and celebrated Internet Volunteer, who has been detained in Syria since 15 March 2012.</seg>
<seg id="1193">His name was deleted from the directory of the Adra prison in which he was sitting on 3 October 2015.</seg>
<seg id="1194">Since then, we have no information about its current state or whereabouts.</seg>
<seg id="1195">The introductory part of his book with the title collective memory gives his friends and his family a voice that insisted on his release and who want to know him back in his normal life and freedom, instantly.</seg>
<seg id="1196">Seeing how Bassel pays a high price for his participation in a free culture has many of us begin to think about their own destinies, actions and decisions.</seg>
<seg id="1197">Why are we here today?</seg>
<seg id="1198">What did we choose?</seg>
<seg id="1199">What have we given up in this process from time to time?</seg>
<seg id="1200">Web developer for open source and digital activist has been in custody of Syrian government authorities since March 2012.</seg>
<seg id="1201">In October 2015, Bassel was transferred from the Adra prison, a non-military institution, to an unknown location.</seg>
<seg id="1202">His wife, the writer and lawyer Noura Ghazi reported that the "military police Bassel" had taken part in Adra as a "strictly secret" command of the military court. "</seg>
<seg id="1203">Ghazi reported that on 12 November 2015, they had been contacted by individuals who presented themselves as inside the Assad government and informed them of an alleged death sentence against their husband.</seg>
<seg id="1204">His whereabouts and condition remain unknown.</seg>
<seg id="1205">A pioneer of the Creative Commons in Syria and actively involved in projects such as Mozilla Firefox and Wikipedia, Bassel played a crucial role in expanding access to the Internet and knowledge for the public in Syria.</seg>
<seg id="1206">Barry Threw, a designer, technologist, and currently the director of New Palmyra, a project that founded Bassel writes on pages 10 and 11 of the book:</seg>
<seg id="1207">Perhaps none of Baslan's cultural prototypes was more provisionary than the work he began with a group of archaeologists and 3D artists around 2005 to virtually reconstruct the ancient ruins of Palmyra.</seg>
<seg id="1208">Palmyra, one of the most important archaeological sites in the world, was the cross of numerous civilizations, and here, Greek-Roman architecture groups merge with local traditions and Persian influences.</seg>
<seg id="1209">At that time, Bassel didn't know that ten years after he started this work, the IS would put everything on it, this architecture that embodies not only the cultural heritage of Sysriens but the world.</seg>
<seg id="1210">This strike in digital archaeology and conservation has created a time capsule that will be invaluable to the public as well as for scientists and artists in the future.</seg>
<seg id="1211">Tragically, Bassel did not finish this project until now.</seg>
<seg id="1212">Noura Ghazi also contributed to her book and writes about her husband's passion to share his knowledge with others even during his time in prison:</seg>
<seg id="1213">I spent my entire life dreaming of freedom and Bassel taught me to embrace her.</seg>
<seg id="1214">I am overwhelmed when I call his name.</seg>
<seg id="1215">Bassel taught me English even when he was in jail.</seg>
<seg id="1216">I learned to read, write and speak English well.</seg>
<seg id="1217">He has always shared his knowledge with anyone who asked him. he taught other prisoners to read, write and speak English.</seg>
<seg id="1218">Bassel opened the door to the technology. he taught me to use both computers and smartphones.</seg>
<seg id="1219">He taught me the internet.</seg>
<seg id="1220">He also taught other prisoners how they use computers, at least theoretically, without actually holding one in their hands.</seg>
<seg id="1221">Ghazi is also the author of Waiting (Waiting), a promulgation that she wrote to her husband in 2012-2015 when he was in custody.</seg>
<seg id="1222">Bassel and Noura have worked together in the book for a year.</seg>
<seg id="1223">She smuggled the lyrics to him when she visited him and he translated it from Arabic into English.</seg>
<seg id="1224">The book is available in a license-free version.</seg>

<seg id="1254">Mozambique: due to corruption-convicted director after release from prison again on previous post</seg>
<seg id="1255">Mozambique reacted with anger on a corruption in which a member of the government returned to work in the state machine after half his sentence to the place where corruption was committed.</seg>
<seg id="1256">This is Diodino Cambaza, who was arrested in 2008 and was sentenced to 22 years in prison together with four other defendants for the disintegration of 54 million people (around 800 000 Euros).</seg>
<seg id="1257">The money came from public funds from Mozambique's airports, the Council of Cambaza, between 2005 and 2008.</seg>
<seg id="1258">Cambaza was released in 2016 because of good management and immediately called for his return to the company, which happened on April 19th.</seg>
<seg id="1259">In accordance with a statement by the Attorney General of the Republic, who filed an application, there would be no obstacle to Cambaza to resume his old post, since the company did not perform any disciplinary proceedings after his detention.</seg>
<seg id="1260">However, many inhabitants do not expect the action good.</seg>
<seg id="1261">The Centre for Public Integrity (Centro de Integridade Pública, CIP), a local institution committed to public transparency, in an interview with Deutsche Welle denounced the company's decision to re-establish the director:</seg>
<seg id="1262">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "puts a setback in the fight against corruption and highlights the lack of transparency and is even a step backward with regard to the efforts of our legal system," "" "" "" "CIP." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1263">What we take note is that the company should also initiate a disciplinary action against the contrary.</seg>
<seg id="1264">However, the company was silent and did not make any reasonable legal steps for the application of the corresponding functions.</seg>
<seg id="1265">Egídio Vaz, a significant voice in the Mozambican social media, also rejects this behaviour and regards the case as "foreign":</seg>
<seg id="1266">If Cambaza was a competent guy, he would be a consultant after he was sentenced to a prison sentence and half of it had to eat.</seg>
<seg id="1267">He could give paid talks and motivating speeches, he could advise and polish his image.</seg>
<seg id="1268">But since he is incompetent he consented to be reintegrated into the company, which he helped to inflict damage.</seg>
<seg id="1269">Consequently it is obvious: Cambaza is gladly paid for his silence.</seg>
<seg id="1270">Disgusting!</seg>
<seg id="1271">Bitone Viage, young Mozambique and student of political science in Brazil, says the director had no moral:</seg>
<seg id="1272">Cambaza is rewarded by the state because he insulted him. I can't believe that someone was rewarded in such a way that already insulted the state.</seg>
<seg id="1273">Cambaza is missing to return to the state and to serve the state, * he had already had a unique opportunity to serve the state, but instead only served by the state itself.</seg>
<seg id="1274">Cambaza used the state as though it was an inexhaustible source of money and the state itself has become weary of this man who was summoned and finally sentenced to a long prison sentence.</seg>
<seg id="1275">Honestly, I don't know why this man was so rewarded.</seg>
<seg id="1276">Francey Zeúte prefers to remind the Prime Minister of Mozambique, Samora Machel, to remember that a thief is in jail:</seg>
<seg id="1277">Thieves are in prison Samora Machel will not only remain in memory for the Mozambique as the first independent president, but also as a sharp, single-edged, and - by the way - prophetic speakers.</seg>
<seg id="1278">One of his most famous oral representations was when he affirmed vigorously that "an ambitious man is capable of all, even the fatherland for his ambitions to sell his own individual interest."</seg>
<seg id="1279">Samora also said: "I don't know if an ambitious man changes, my experience shows that this is not the case. he changes the tactics, but he does not turn away from his ambitions.</seg>

<seg id="1287">The Burmese word "Kalar pae" means chickpea or splitting.</seg>

<seg id="1289">According to information from Facebook users in Myanmar, the well-known social network took their posts from the net because they contained the word 'Kalar'.</seg>
<seg id="1290">Although it is still being discussed about the origin of the word, it is usually used to refer to people of Eastern India or generally used as an adjective "Indian."</seg>
<seg id="1291">Facebook censuses the word "Kalar" or, for the most part, to be part of an initiative to address the widespread problem of hate speech in Burma in the social network.</seg>
<seg id="1292">In recent years, the rise of radical nationalist movements has given the word an extremely degrading connotation.</seg>
<seg id="1293">In particular, it is a word commonly used by ultra-nationalists as hate speech against Muslims representing a minority of the population in Myanmar.</seg>
<seg id="1294">But in an effort to combat hate speech in Myanmar, the company has censored a lot of meaningful content on its platform.</seg>
<seg id="1295">Today 'Kalar' may normally be associated with racism, but the word itself does not automatically evoke hate speech.</seg>
<seg id="1296">The context is important & # 8212; many people have reported that even posts in which they have discussed the use of the word have been censored in order to use the word.</seg>
<seg id="1297">In addition, there are several Burmese words with different meanings, which have the same sequence of letters as' Kalar '.</seg>
<seg id="1298">For example, chair on Burmeric is also written 'Kalar htaing', which contains the same letters as well as other words like 'Kalar pae', 'Kalar OAT' (camel) or 'kalarkaar' (curtain).</seg>
<seg id="1299">The Faceboobutzer Aung Kaung Myat explained the different meanings of words with the sound of 'Kalar':</seg>
<seg id="1300">A post of one of my friends was extinguished today because he contained the word Kalar.</seg>
<seg id="1301">However, he asked his friends in a witty manner if they knew how to alleviate his back pain by making a pun game.</seg>
<seg id="1302">The ku la - "healing" (ku) + question word (la) on Burmese - resembles the racist expression, but the context is completely different.</seg>
<seg id="1303">There were different reactions to the Facebook Initiative.</seg>
<seg id="1304">Zin Win Hats believes that it will reduce hate speech of radical nationalists, but also stressed that Facebook needs to be more analytical before releasing all posts that are suspected of spreading racism.</seg>
<seg id="1305">Facebook does not delete the word "Kalar."</seg>
<seg id="1306">It filters the word automatically.</seg>
<seg id="1307">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "automatism will not understand what you write on Facilook." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1308">What it should do instead is to carefully analyze the post and control it by checking the adjacent words.</seg>
<seg id="1309">For example, "Kalar Htine" (chair) and "Kalar pae" (spacers).</seg>
<seg id="1310">The good thing is that these dirty nationalists who spread hate speech have received a fairly good lesson.</seg>
<seg id="1311">Now it is time to circumcise its nationalism.</seg>
<seg id="1312">While the action may send a strong signal to everyone who disseminates hate speech, the efficiency of this strategy may not last long.</seg>
<seg id="1313">The experiences of social networks in China like Sina Weibo and WeChat have shown that the censorship of keywords is often a cat and mouse game, whereby the users of social networks are simply starting to use a new word or alternative spelling of the censored word to express their views.</seg>
<seg id="1314">The author Aung Kaung Myat described how Facebook started to delete his posts when he only wanted to tell his friends that the word 'Kalar' was banished by the social network:</seg>
<seg id="1315">... when I became aware of this new Facebook directive, I made a post to tell my Facebook friends that the word is locked.</seg>
<seg id="1316">Ironically, my post was removed from Facebook and I was forbidden to read, post and share content for 24 hours, because the post was not consistent with the Facebook community standards. "</seg>
<seg id="1317">Facebook has removed a variety of posts by people who have no negative intentions or simply try to show their opinions against the hate speech of radical nationalists.</seg>
<seg id="1318">Patrick Murphy wrote that his post was removed, who has nothing to do with hate speech:</seg>
<seg id="1319">Post without hate speech from Facebook.</seg>
<seg id="1320">In the post, the author informed his opinion of why extreme nationalism and religious fundamentalism in the country are bad.</seg>
<seg id="1321">Chan Myae Khine believes that Facebook should have done more before the start of the initiative, for example the Burmese Internet community asking for advice:</seg>
<seg id="1322">Facebook might have a benevolent intention to lessen racism in Burma through its platform, but it does not work.</seg>
<seg id="1323">Censoring such words will only bring more hatred within the different communities.</seg>
<seg id="1324">In addition, it seems as if they have started this without local context or technical support and have forbidden such words as "chair" or "inheritence curry."</seg>
<seg id="1325">Even when they found out that they made mistakes, they did not try to correct the deleted posts.</seg>
<seg id="1326">If they would only have a little more respect for the 15 million benefits that would give them a big turnover, that would be great.</seg>
<seg id="1327">Chromebooks automatic censorship made a lot of ridicule among the users.</seg>
<seg id="1328">Instead of taking it seriously, users now make fun on Facebook and consciously write the word 'Kalar' not in the context of hate speech to see if their posts are taken from the net.</seg>
<seg id="1329">Here you can see some screenshots of Facebook posts that didn't contain hate speech but were still removed:</seg>
<seg id="1330">Used with permission.</seg>
<seg id="1331">The Burmese text reads "I want to sit on a chair and eat peas curry and watch an Indian film.</seg>
<seg id="1332">"" "" "" "just to try out whether Facebook removes the post containing the word" "" "" "". "" "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="1335">Screenshot, used with permission.</seg>
<seg id="1336">Over the past five years extreme nationalist ideologies and religious fundamentalists who have used social networks to expand their voices and influence have increased.</seg>
<seg id="1337">Among other things, hate speech in social networks should additionally heat up violence in the communities in Myanmar, especially in the area of Rakhine, where confrontations between Muslims and Buddhists have forced thousands to flee.</seg>
<seg id="1338">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "Facebook was criticized for its failure to bring out the balancing hate speech on its Burmese sides." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1339">But instead of censoring the word 'Kalar' it would have been better to look at the context rather than to concentrate on code and learn from them.</seg>

<seg id="1346">This has been done notwithstanding the fact that Trinidad and Tobago are a contracting partner of the UN Children's Rights Convention, the minors as defined, each person under the age of 18. "</seg>
<seg id="1347">Statistics of the UN for the years 2002-2012 show that the proportion of children already married to 15 in Trinidad and Tobago was 2.8 percent, and at 18 it was 8.1 percent.</seg>
<seg id="1348">In 2011, the Federal Statistical Office of the country confirmed that more than 8400 girls and 1,300 boys were married under 19.</seg>
<seg id="1349">Online petitions and social media movements, which tried to abolish laws for the children's marriage, followed at the foot and enjoyed great support. undoubtedly they helped to bring about that result.</seg>
<seg id="1350">Nevertheless, everything went smoothly.</seg>
<seg id="1351">A Hindu guide, for example, had no qualms about telling the critics of the children, they were to take care of their own affairs. "</seg>
<seg id="1352">This sort of religious opposition created tensions in this rather uncomplicated affair, and at some point doubts came up whether the opposition would agree with the bill at all.</seg>
<seg id="1353">But at the beginning of 2017 the bill was adopted against the children before - despite 4 senators (among them a woman) of the opposition and an independent, which contained - so that he could be discussed in the House of Representatives, where a simple majority would make him the law.</seg>
<seg id="1354">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "now only the president of the country must agree and declare the law." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1355">One of the Senators of the country gave on Facebook a status update which Leslie-Ann Boiselle posted on Instagram again:</seg>
<seg id="1356">Mr. Senator Clarence Rambharat: the bill against the children's marriage was voted in the House of Representatives with 35 votes and none of them decided against it.</seg>
<seg id="1357">Having previously been approved in the Senate, the draft can now become a law.</seg>
<seg id="1358">The majority of social media users were thrilled because the laws for children were finally changed.</seg>
<seg id="1359">Member of the Facebook member Lovell Francis, who is a minister of ministers in the Ministry of Education, said:</seg>
<seg id="1360">It has taken too much time and unnecessary talk, which has disguised the heart of the matter, but do you know what? the breeze is now illegal in Trinidad and Tobago, and that is well worth every price.</seg>
<seg id="1361">While Abel Jackson thought it was definitely long enough to abolish the practice, Lara Quentrall-Thomas was overjoyed that the day finally came:</seg>
<seg id="1362">Public Status Update on Facebook from Lara Quentral- Thomas, which says:,, Excellent news!</seg>
<seg id="1363">The law of marriage has been decided.</seg>
<seg id="1364">Minimum age - 18, Voices - 35 for it - 0 against it!!!! "</seg>
<seg id="1365">Torade Mutota, which belongs to the Women's Institute for Alternative Development (WINAD), a civil society group that openly discussed how important the adoption of the law was:</seg>
<seg id="1366">The marriage-capable age in Trinidad and Tobago is now independent of the religious affiliation 18 years.</seg>
<seg id="1367">The draft for the modification of the marriage network was decided today, on 9 June 2017.</seg>
<seg id="1368">There are 41 MPs in the House of Representatives and 35 of them were present in the voting.</seg>
<seg id="1369">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "all the deputies that were present have voted for the law." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1370">The children's marriage is not permitted by law in Trinidad and Tobago.</seg>
<seg id="1371">It was a long fight (...) # childbearing shield.</seg>
<seg id="1372">Many thanks to all the activists who challenged him.</seg>
<seg id="1373">Congratulations.</seg>
<seg id="1374">A thank you to our deputies.</seg>
<seg id="1375">But a possible catch comes in the shape of Sat Maharaj, Secretary General of the Sanatan Dharma Maha Sabha, the most famous Hindu organisation in the country.</seg>
<seg id="1376">Months ago, Maharaj has announced his intention to undertake judicial steps, the law should be passed, and he seems to redeem his promise now.</seg>
<seg id="1377">While the Attorney General Paris Al rawi, a proponent of the law, thought it was quite legitimate if Maharaj wanted to go against the law, most social media users wished that the debate on the subject would be different.</seg>
<seg id="1378">Patricia Vorrell suggested:</seg>
<seg id="1379">Dear Sat, if we, instead of discussing the discussion, in a way that can only provoke panic and disgrace, instead of talking about the problem that the state, our daughters in front of protecting them from being misused by large, hard-boiled men who are in front of them, would be ready to continue the discussion?</seg>
<seg id="1380">Or do you think it's not a problem?</seg>
<seg id="1381">However, whether it comes to judicial proceedings against the law or not, this legislation is an important step - but there are still places in the world where the children are legally or still the norm in different gradations, even though there are laws that they prohibit.</seg>

<seg id="1390">By mirroring web pages Turkish users can view Wikipedia content</seg>
<seg id="1391">The Wikipedia page was published on January 18, 2012, contrary to the SOPA (Stop Online Privacy Act) and PIPA copyright legislation in the United States, internationally darkened.</seg>
<seg id="1392">Created by Wikipedia (CC BY-SA 3.0)</seg>
<seg id="1393">For more than a month, Turkey has been blocking the popular and crowdsourcing principle based on encyclopedia of Wikipedia.</seg>
<seg id="1394">Day after day, it becomes clear how important the platform is for users to find and share helpful and reliable information.</seg>
<seg id="1395">Both students and reporters and fans of TV series are fighting against the blockage.</seg>
<seg id="1396">Although many technology-savvy Internet users are used to use bypassing tools for blocked websites (a recent article from the New York Times reports that Turkey has the third largest VPN prevalence in the world), most of the ordinary Wikipedia users do not fall into this category.</seg>
<seg id="1397">Although Turkey has been blocking Article from Wikipedia since 2008, as recently posted in a published report by the Berkman Klein Center for Internet & amp; Society at Harvard University, regular blockages of the Internet have been adopted since 2007 after the Internet Act (No. 5651) was adopted.</seg>
<seg id="1398">According to China, Turkey is the second most famous country in the world when it comes to massive censorship from Wikipedia.</seg>
<seg id="1399">While the platform remains locked, several mirror sites (sites that reflect the content of Wikipedia and are frequently updated) are now dipped.</seg>
<seg id="1400">A solution came from IPFS (the InterPlanetary File System), when the platform deposited all Turkish Wikipedia pages on its dedicated peer-to-peer network (so host computer connections), which does not support the system of domain names and thus makes a complete censorship difficult.</seg>
<seg id="1401">However, the content is available in spite of the legal ban.</seg>
<seg id="1402">In a blog post, IPFS reports about its efforts:</seg>
<seg id="1403">After we heard the news (about the block from Wikipedia), we set out everything to take snapshots of Wikipedia on the IPFS platform. thus, the possibility exists to read the content on decentralized and distributed ways.</seg>
<seg id="1404">This can help users view at least all Wikipedia content, even if they cannot reach the website www.wikipedia.org themselves.</seg>
<seg id="1405">IPFS also stated that this step was done independently of the Wikimedia Foundation, and it is merely screenshots and no live or dynamic versions of the website.</seg>
<seg id="1406">However, Wikimedia was involved in other efforts to circumvent the lock.</seg>
<seg id="1407">Cristian Consonni of Wikimedia Italy has produced both tr.vikiansiklopedia, a Mirrorpage from Wikipedia, as well as WikiMirror, an open source project that anyone can use to host similar irrors pages when locked in the respective country Wikipedia.</seg>
<seg id="1408">Consonni reported Subhashish Panigrahi - Global Voices members as well as collaborators at the Panigrahi's Open Speaks "Podcast:</seg>
<seg id="1409">It is not a complete copy of a proxy address, a mirror.</seg>
<seg id="1410">One accesses another URL that is not the original. that what you see then is from Wikipedia.</seg>
<seg id="1411">Essentially, the server directs the request to the correct Wikipedia page, so it is possible to see the contents of Wikipedia itself if they are locked in Turkey.</seg>
<seg id="1412">For this is executed by a server that is not in Turkey.</seg>

<seg id="1416">Used with permission.</seg>
<seg id="1417">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "Sagar Giri was never satisfied with the photos he saw around him. they were blurry with badly positioned motifs and washed colors." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1418">This motivated him to take a camera and try to straighten the situation.</seg>
<seg id="1419">Back then he was a child.</seg>
<seg id="1420">Today, at the age of 28, Sagar tries to bring Neptune's wildlife to the international stage.</seg>
<seg id="1421">And his hometown right next to the Chitwan National Park, offers him the perfect opportunity to take photographs that draw attention to Nepal's wildlife.</seg>
<seg id="1422">He described on Facebook how this prime location helps him in his work:</seg>
<seg id="1423">I live at the edge of Chitwan National Park, a world natural heritage. what could be better for a passionate wildlife photographer!!</seg>
<seg id="1424">I was right at home when suddenly Navaraj (the manager of the Chitwan Gaida Lodge) suddenly invited me. he had received a phone call from my father that a leopard on the banks of the Rapti river would be a leopard.</seg>
<seg id="1425">The dam is only a few minutes away from the tourist resort of Sauraha.</seg>
<seg id="1426">Immediately I ran away with my camera and was there in a few minutes.</seg>
<seg id="1427">My father had watched him and showed me the place on the other river side, where the leopard found himself and I immediately started to make pictures!!</seg>
<seg id="1428">Sagar seeks cooperation with the authorities in order to obtain worldwide recognition for Neptune's nature and would like to deepen the understanding that wild animals are not as frightening as they look.</seg>
<seg id="1429">And he should know it, for he was standing by face to tigers face to face, saying,</seg>
<seg id="1430">A tiger is not disturbed by the opinion of the sheep while sleeping!!</seg>
<seg id="1431">Late in the evening. the light is too weak.</seg>
<seg id="1432">Sleeping time for all animals and birds.</seg>
<seg id="1433">Also I was on the way home because of the darkness, when suddenly the king of the bus appeared. he immediately sets off, we see us and he stares through the scarf-trees!!</seg>
<seg id="1434">To promote the protection of wild animals Sagar places the logo "I click for rest" (lit.: I click for environmental protection) on its photos.</seg>
<seg id="1435">However, his passion for the promotion of Nepalese nature and wildlife is not always easy.</seg>
<seg id="1436">He waited for 22 days, and usually lived in a tent in order to make recordings of Otters in the Bardia National Park. up to 12 days it took until he was able to photograph a tiger and six to seven days for the perfect photo of birds that live near the tourist accommodation.</seg>

<seg id="1469">This entry was written by Kayonaaz Kalyanwala and was originally published on video Volunteers, an award-winning international media organisation from India.</seg>
<seg id="1470">A revised version was re-published as part of a content sharing agreement.</seg>
<seg id="1471">In many parts of India, women have the greatest care to pronounce the name of their husbands or even older men in the family.</seg>
<seg id="1472">"" "" "" "instead, they use a pronoun or say" "" "" "" "father of my child." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1473">From Chhattisgarh to Maharashtra and Uttar Pradesh, women admit that due to the social pressure they respect the husband, as well as fear of the consequences they should disregard the norm, maintain this practice alive.</seg>
<seg id="1474">Last year, Malati Mahatoto from the Indian state of Odisha was convicted by a false tribunal and expelled from her family and the village community after having addressed a married family with a name.</seg>
<seg id="1475">The tradition of naming their wives by name is also common among men. however, they have far fewer grants to fear, if at all those, they should not follow this practice.</seg>
<seg id="1476">In the small village of Walhe in the district of Pune, in Maharashtra, nine women, including health personnel as well as housewives, joined a unique club and became the main topic of the city's main topic.</seg>
<seg id="1477">It is a place only for them to discuss and discuss the intricacies of the patriarchy.</seg>
<seg id="1478">As one of 56 clubs, which exists in 13 Indian states, he is part of the # Khero Badal campaign, which is operated by the Video Volunteers community and advocates for the mining of the patriarchy.</seg>
<seg id="1479">Rohini Pawas has been working for seven years with the help of her video camera to expose practices, such as children's marriage up to the exile of HIV and AIDS victims, and manages these clubs.</seg>
<seg id="1480">It reports how these clubs created a safe place for these women and at the same time made them ambassadors of change.</seg>
<seg id="1481">The first video that Rohini showed in her discussion round acted by women who don't call her husbands name.</seg>
<seg id="1482">She decided on this subject because she wanted to open the conversation about the patriarchy with a problem with which the women can easily identify.</seg>
<seg id="1483">Not to pronounce the name of her husbands is a custom that they all perpetuate and never questioned.</seg>
<seg id="1484">Rohini saying:</seg>
<seg id="1485">This tradition testifies that a woman respects her husband and wishes him a long life.</seg>
<seg id="1486">A woman who does not stop this is considered as a deceitful woman, as a woman without morals.</seg>
<seg id="1487">Tradition is so deeply rooted that we have never thought of this until this round of discussion.</seg>
<seg id="1488">At the beginning, Rohini, who had never called her husband by name, wanted to try out at home, as it goes.</seg>
<seg id="1489">She showed the video of the discussion round her husband and her mother-in-law.</seg>
<seg id="1490">Rohini told:</seg>
<seg id="1491">My mother-in-law and my husband remained silent for a long time after the video ended.</seg>
<seg id="1492">Prakash, my husband, turned to me and said I should call him from now on with his name.</seg>
<seg id="1493">With this confidence in the luggage, Rohini started their first discussion club.</seg>
<seg id="1494">Many women had never heard the word "patriarchy" before. some believed it was a good thing, because it meant that younger members of a family, especially girls and women, would be protected.</seg>
<seg id="1495">At the beginning of the round, Rohini showed a video about the problem in Uttar Pradesh.</seg>
<seg id="1496">After the video projection, the women tried to start the discussion with an exercise.</seg>
<seg id="1497">Rohini asked every participant to say the name of her husband with different feelings - happy, angry, sad, loving and so on.</seg>
<seg id="1498">Then she asked all, "If we can't tell the name of our husbands, but they can call us as they want, does that mean that they don't respect us?</seg>
<seg id="1499">"" "" "" "should it not be equivalent?" "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1500">"some of these women have been married for 30 years and this was the first day they brought the name of their husbands on their lips," says Rohini Paz from Walhe village in Maharashtra about breaking a secular tradition in which married women can never pronounce the name of their husbands.</seg>
<seg id="1501">Rohini told:</seg>
<seg id="1502">A woman was so frightened that during the whole exercise she only sneaked in front of him; another decided to let the whole accumulated frustration come out against him and his family by curbing him.</seg>
<seg id="1503">The expression on their faces was ecstatic.</seg>
<seg id="1504">I think I'll never forget it again.</seg>
<seg id="1505">Even in the rush of adrenalin to have broken with an ancient tradition, the women decided that they would actually try to call their husbands at home.</seg>
<seg id="1506">And they kept their word.</seg>
<seg id="1507">In the next few days, Rohini received a plethora of reports.</seg>
<seg id="1508">The husband of a woman called Rohini and asked what ideas she put in her head: his wife couldn't stop saying his name.</seg>
<seg id="1509">Another club member decided to do it at dinner in front of the entire family.</seg>
<seg id="1510">When her mother-in-law stared her, she was afraid and said it was a mistake.</seg>
<seg id="1511">"" "" "" "another woman said," "" "" "" "Rohini said I should do it." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1512">A husband of a participant was less understanding and the situation developed into force.</seg>
<seg id="1513">Rohini reports how women have tried to stop other practices, such as wearing the inox red dot on the forehead, which indicates the spouses:</seg>
<seg id="1514">Why do women only need to show that they are married?</seg>
<seg id="1515">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "I said to my husband that I would carry the interest-red dot if he did it too." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1516">He laughed only and I stopped wearing him.</seg>
<seg id="1517">The other women have not stopped completely, but think they are now in a better position to choose themselves, not to wear it on some days.</seg>
<seg id="1518">For many women, the discussion club is a safe place where they can share their opinions and goals.</seg>
<seg id="1519">"we make a trip at every discussion club.</seg>
<seg id="1520">We normally pack lunch and water and go out into the field.</seg>
<seg id="1521">"" "" "" "I don't want women to worry about who could hear what" "" "" "", "she says." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1522">In the last months they celebrated their own birthdays with cakes for the first time in their lives. they danced and sang and talked about things they had never thought before.</seg>
<seg id="1523">Rohini saying:</seg>
<seg id="1524">I have been working on these problems for so many years and yet I have never talked so honestly about some things, for example how our identities are tied to our husbands.</seg>
<seg id="1525">It feels great to be able to say certain things out loud, no matter how small they occur.</seg>
<seg id="1526">In a discussion round, we talked about the concept of honor and how it is connected to clothes.</seg>
<seg id="1527">Some women in the group have borne only Saris since their marriage.</seg>
<seg id="1528">For most people this is okay, but some wanted a salty-Kurta, a wide shirt over a trousers, they didn't dare.</seg>
<seg id="1529">After a lot of argument and discussion about the advantages of their own fashion choice, the morals combined with the saris and much more, Rohini sneaked up their own pair of Kurtas (Oberhemden) into a discussion round, so that the women could wear them.</seg>
<seg id="1530">Next they decided to plan a trip to Goa where they can wear jeans and Rohini is sure they will manage it.</seg>
<seg id="1531">On the question of whether something has changed in the five months since its first discussion club, Rohini confirmed that things are slowly rolling:</seg>
<seg id="1532">So far we have only done small steps.</seg>
<seg id="1533">Some women tried it a few times, but then stopped to say the name of her husband.</seg>
<seg id="1534">Some, including me, do it yet, but only if they are alone and there are no other family members.</seg>
<seg id="1535">Only one or two women continue to say the name of their husbands; only one or two women now wear Zinnoberrot on their foreheads every time.</seg>
<seg id="1536">The women in the discussion club know that the changes they want to achieve in their lives - like the hammers for more freedom of movement or their own choice of clothes - lie at the end of a heavily navigating river.</seg>
<seg id="1537">By giving each other self-confidence, they are aware that they are sitting in the same boat.</seg>
<seg id="1538">How Rohini declares:</seg>
<seg id="1539">Each of us is a victim of the patriarchy.</seg>
<seg id="1540">I am also.</seg>
<seg id="1541">But this club gives each of us the confidence that something will change.</seg>
<seg id="1542">And I know that it is not only limited to 30 families. there will be a chain reaction when every woman goes home in the club and tells other people about what we are talking about and what we are doing.</seg>
<seg id="1543">We all sit in the same boat.</seg>

<seg id="1548">Screenshot from the official YouTube channel of the Beatles.</seg>
<seg id="1549">On the 29th of June this year, the hashtag was to be used to find the way to the Japanese Twitter trend, where many fans exchanged memories and shared their appreciation for the Beatles.</seg>
<seg id="1550">The visit of the Beatles in 1966 in Japan is regarded as a reversal in the Japanese culture of the post-war period.</seg>
<seg id="1551">The first Japanese journalist, Hoshika Rumiko, who interviewed the Beatles 1964 in London, noted in 2016 on the occasion of the 50th anniversary of his first visit:</seg>
<seg id="1552">For just under five days the Beatles were in the country, but this was enough to let the Japanese go through.</seg>
<seg id="1553">It became clear to the people here that they had no choice but to receive the Beatles with open arms.</seg>
<seg id="1554">Many well-known Japanese sizes had reached its zenith when the Beatles came to Japan for the first time in 1966.</seg>
<seg id="1555">The music of the cult band is "more than just a universal language like English," said Ryuichi Isaka, President of the retail giant Seven & amp; i Holdings, the online magazine Nikkei Asian Review.</seg>
<seg id="1556">Good morning! today is the Beatles memorial day in Japan.</seg>
<seg id="1557">Even today, songs from the Beatles are sung in Japanese karaoke bars and in English classes at Japanese middle schools.</seg>
<seg id="1558">The kitsch of the Beatles survives everything.</seg>
<seg id="1559">Today is Beatles Day of Remembrance.</seg>
<seg id="1560">We all love the Beatles in our house.</seg>
<seg id="1561">I don't know if this "Winnie the Pooh" doll should represent John Lennon or not.</seg>
<seg id="1562">And as it is for fans, Japanese naturally make pilgrimages to the known places that are related to the band.</seg>
<seg id="1563">If you love the Beatles, these are your 5 places that you absolutely have to visit.</seg>
<seg id="1564">1) Abbey Road</seg>
<seg id="1565">2) Mathew Street (in Liverpool)</seg>
<seg id="1566">3) Strawberry Fields (memorial in New York)</seg>
<seg id="1567">4) Penny Lane</seg>
<seg id="1568">5) (From the link) The Beatles Story (Museum), Liverpool</seg>
<seg id="1569">The pilgrimages can sometimes not be whimsical enough:</seg>
<seg id="1570">Good morning together.</seg>
<seg id="1571">Today is Beatles Day of Remembrance.</seg>
<seg id="1572">Exactly today in 1966, the Beatles came to Japan for the first time.</seg>
<seg id="1573">The characters from the movie K-On! went on a pilgrimage to London and ran over Abbey Road.</seg>
<seg id="1574">The same thing we did last year.</seg>
<seg id="1575">And of course, some companies also use the fan community in terms of market terms, such as these Ramen-Shop (Ramen are Japanese noodles) in Tokyo.</seg>
<seg id="1576">Good morning, here is Mutahiro Koya Ramen! today is Beatles memorial day.</seg>
<seg id="1577">And what could this be for a day?</seg>
<seg id="1578">"" "" "" "today I will listen to" "" "" "" "Yesterday" "" "" "" "and I will eat Ramen noodles in Koya." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="1585">A new system of kidnapping people for organ trading, presumably for superstitious purposes, alarmed the police of Zambézia, a province in Mozambique. the local government now called for a number of operations to stop the practice.</seg>
<seg id="1586">At the beginning of the month three men were killed in the district of Milange, a few kilometers from the border to Malawi.</seg>
<seg id="1587">One of the victims was found beheaded and a part of the organs were removed.</seg>
<seg id="1588">Two men were arrested and subsequently admitted that the organs of shamans in Tanzania and Malawi have been used.</seg>
<seg id="1589">According to the local superstition that the head of a man-headed man could reveal gold or bring wealth, the police officer of Zambézia declared the BBC.</seg>
<seg id="1590">It is the first time that successive attacks on bald men were registered in Mozambique.</seg>
<seg id="1591">Another group, the goal of assassinations for obscure purposes, are people with albinism.</seg>
<seg id="1592">This led to the fact that the UN in 2016 conducted a mission in the South African country to investigate this practice.</seg>
<seg id="1593">The persecution of people with albinism is common in other countries of southern Africa, especially in the neighbouring country of Tanzania, where the government developed campaigns to fight this superstition and prejudice.</seg>
<seg id="1594">Ukombe Weya lives in the city of Maputo.</seg>
<seg id="1595">He warned those who are planning to travel to the country:</seg>
<seg id="1596">Beware of kahle men who travel to Mozambique to travel to Mozambique are target of ritual attacks, warned the Mozambican police following the latest killings of three men-faced men due to their body parts.</seg>
<seg id="1597">Two suspects were arrested in the district of Milange, where the killings took place.</seg>
<seg id="1598">Husband Algy Adamo, student and resident of the city of Inhambane in the south of Mozambique, said that the local police have already followed the case:</seg>
<seg id="1599">PRM believes that the shamans are involved in the death of the bald men.</seg>
<seg id="1600">The persecution and murder of bald individuals for the extraction and sale of their organs in the district of Morrumbala, province of Zambézia, has commissioned cultural motives and is commissioned by the traditional shamans, which also acknowledges that a belief does exist according to which the victims in the head had power to generate the riches.</seg>
<seg id="1601">In the last days three men were murdered in this part of the country with hair loss problems.</seg>
<seg id="1602">Angela Ferreira Samantha shared on Facebook the chronicle of the Bloggers poor Snaippa, who pointed out that the problem is part of the greater social difficulty facing Mozambique:</seg>
<seg id="1603">I MÖCHTE GERMANY BEING Mozambique, THE SME is ashamed of a country in which people would be ashamed to have sex against good grades and do not hurt others or even take their lives to earn their bread, a country in which neither the albinos nor bald or bald-headed for superstitious purposes or "black magic" are hunted.</seg>
<seg id="1604">Despite the seriousness of the phenomenon, some of the opportunities for macabre humor could not be missed.</seg>
<seg id="1605">Zenaida Machado, scientist of Human Rights Watch for Angola and Mozambique and avid Twitter users, tweetets that both the boss of the district Morrumbala, Pedro Sapange, as well as the police spokesman Zambézias, Inácio Dina, both are bald:</seg>

<seg id="1626">A photo of Liu Xiaobo and Liu Xia, which was probably made recently.</seg>
<seg id="1627">This story was originally published on July 8, 2017 at Hong Kong Free Press.</seg>
<seg id="1628">The following version will be published as part of a partnership agreement via Global Voices.</seg>
<seg id="1629">The case of the imprisoned Chinese dissident Liu Xiaobo attracted attention in the international community after his lawyer had announced at the end of June that he was hospitalized for liver cancer in the end stage.</seg>
<seg id="1630">In 2009, Liu was sentenced to 11 years imprisonment for "Subversion" (state risk) after having participated in the draft of the Charter 08, a manifesto that demanded democratic reforms in China.</seg>
<seg id="1631">He was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for his work in 2010.</seg>
<seg id="1632">The Ministry of Foreign Affairs in China referred to Lius case as "an internal matter" and told a spokesman that he considered it "not necessary to discuss this matter with any other country."</seg>
<seg id="1633">Nevertheless, China continues to uphold calls from the international community, the Nobel Prize winner and his wife, poet Liu Xia, or to allow him to be treated abroad.</seg>
<seg id="1634">While some countries have criticized the strict treatment of the couple in Beijing, others have completely wiped out the subject.</seg>
<seg id="1635">Hong Kong Free Press has summarised some reactions abroad.</seg>
<seg id="1636">United Nations</seg>
<seg id="1637">Zeid Ra-ad al-Hussein, United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, met Chinese officials at the end of June in order to discuss the case of Liu.</seg>
<seg id="1638">However, a spokesman refused to comment on whether the United Nations should exercise pressure to allow Liu abroad treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1639">Norway in Norway</seg>
<seg id="1640">Norway's Prime Minister Erna Solberg and Foreign Minister Børge Brende had refused to answer questions about Lius release.</seg>
<seg id="1641">The relationship between China and Norway was stalled after the Nobel Peace Prize 2010 was conferred to Liu, although the Norwegian government announced that this was ultimately nothing to do with the decision.</seg>
<seg id="1642">Diplomatic relations were resumed in December last year. only in June Norway signed an agreement to resume salmon exports to China, as exports were largely blocked since 2010.</seg>
<seg id="1643">After the news spread that Liu was seriously ill, the Nobel Committee expressed his hope of unconditional release and invited Liu to pick up his prize in Oslo.</seg>
<seg id="1644">Due to his imprisonment, he was unable to accept his prize.</seg>
<seg id="1645">During the ceremony, Liu was represented by an empty chair.</seg>
<seg id="1646">European Union The European Union</seg>
<seg id="1647">On 6 July, the European Parliament adopted a decision in which China was urged to free Liu and his wife from house arrest and allow him to seek medical support wherever he wants.</seg>
<seg id="1648">The top diplomat of the EU, Federica Mogherini, also urged China to release Lius as she announced in an explanation on June 30:</seg>
<seg id="1649">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "at the same time, we expect China to raise all restrictions of Mr. Lius" "" "" "" "wife and family members." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1650">They should meet and receive all the visits they desire, and be able to communicate freely with the outside world.</seg>
<seg id="1651">United States of America</seg>
<seg id="1652">U.S. Ambassador Terry Branstad told us that the Americans would like "him to have the opportunity to treat abroad, in so far as he can help him with his recovery."</seg>
<seg id="1653">A spokeswoman for the US embassy in China, Mary Beth Polley, announced the news agency AFP on June 27 that the message urged Chinese authorities not only to release Liu, but to free his wife Liu Xia from their house arrest.</seg>
<seg id="1654">The US embassy summoned a furious response from China, with the outward appearance of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, that "no country has the right to interfere and to comment on Chinese internal affairs."</seg>
<seg id="1655">Polley told that China should offer the couple the following:</seg>
<seg id="1656">Protection and freedom such as freedom of travel and access to the medical care of his choice, to which they are entitled according to the Chinese Constitution and the legal system and international obligations.</seg>
<seg id="1657">The U.S. Senators Marco Rubio, Jeff Merkley and Ted Cruz have also introduced a resolution in Congress to push the Chinese government to release Liu and his wife unconditionally.</seg>

<seg id="1660">The German spokesperson, Steffen Seibert, wrote on July 3, Berlin, hope that Liu will receive all the medical support he needs and that a humanitarian solution for Liu Xiaobo should be the highest priority. "</seg>
<seg id="1661">Chinese President Xi Jinping appeared on July 7 and 8 at the G20 summit in Hamburg.</seg>
<seg id="1662">Previously reported diplomatic sources in Beijing's news agency Reuters reported that China had great concerns about whether the vortex around Liu could overshadow the visit to Hamburg.</seg>
<seg id="1663">Canada - Canada</seg>
<seg id="1664">On 28 June, the Canadian ambassador John McCallum called on China to provide Liu with appropriate medical care and give him the opportunity to take care of his family.</seg>
<seg id="1665">Lius Advocate told AFP earlier that Liu's wife, Liu Xia, could visit him every day, but the police always monitored the room in the hospital and that it is not allowed to speak and contact with someone outside, including his lawyers.</seg>
<seg id="1666">McCallum continues to tell:</seg>
<seg id="1667">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "Canada calls on China to uphold its international human rights obligations, including freedom of speech, and to release those locked up for the exercise of these rights." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1668">France - France</seg>
<seg id="1669">France's foreign ministry called on China to release Liu for humanitarian reasons in an explanation on 29 June:</seg>
<seg id="1670">All necessary measures must be taken to ensure that Liu Xiaobo receives all the treatments he needs, regardless of where. furthermore, his wife and family shall have contact with him.</seg>
<seg id="1671">Although the news channel France Info already reported that the French government would welcome Liu in the country, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs announced that there is no further information whether France will eventually receive it.</seg>
<seg id="1672">Taiwan - Taiwan</seg>
<seg id="1673">The Council of landlords in Taiwan urged China on 27 June to release Liu and show greater tolerance to those who use peaceful means to demand political reforms and democratic development.</seg>
<seg id="1674">The Taiwanese lawmakers Yu Mei-nu of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party also called on China to allow the sick intellectual Liu to be treated in Taiwan.</seg>
<seg id="1675">Dalai Lama - The Dalai Lama</seg>
<seg id="1676">The spiritual leader in Tibet, the Dalai Lama, was very concerned in an explanation on 28 June around Liu and admitted that many asked him to pray for Liu wellbeing.</seg>
<seg id="1677">He said about Liu:</seg>
<seg id="1678">It is my belief that the initiatives he took and for which he was strictly punished had led to a more harmonious, more stable and prosperous China, which in turn would have contributed to a more peaceful world.</seg>
<seg id="1679">I personally felt very moved and also encouraged when I saw that hundreds of Chinese intellectuals and affected citizens, inspired by Liu Xiaobo, signed the Charter 08, which stands for democracy, freedom and rule of law in China.</seg>

<seg id="1683">Is Singapore a city or country?</seg>
<seg id="1684">The question may seem stupid as Singapore is recognised as an independent state on an international level.</seg>
<seg id="1685">But according to the Minister of Justice K. Shanmugam, Singapore was supposed to be regarded as a city.</seg>
<seg id="1686">This remark has triggered a debate in the blogosphere.</seg>
<seg id="1687">During the meeting of the international branch of the Bar Association of the State of New York, the Minister noted that many people criticized the dominance of the only political party in Singapore because they compared Singapore to other countries.</seg>
<seg id="1688">He supports Singapore as a city.</seg>
<seg id="1689">... no one has questioned whether New York is a democracy...</seg>
<seg id="1690">This is what most people commit a mistake.</seg>
<seg id="1691">I have tried to explain that we are different.</seg>
<seg id="1692">We are a city.</seg>
<seg id="1693">We are not a country.</seg>
<seg id="1694">"" "" "" "the blog Cavalierio accused the Minister of Justice to" "" "" "" "turn logic" "" "" "" "to defend the existing authoritarian exercise of power in Singapore." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1695">And then, after all our efforts and sacrifices to create this precious land, one hears that we are ultimately not a country.</seg>
<seg id="1696">It sounded so vulgar, it had the appearance of an escape from the responsibilities, a breach of duty.</seg>
<seg id="1697">Singapore, if you're not my country, whose land is it then?</seg>
<seg id="1698">The reasons cited by Shanmugam were not very nobel: he defended an idea, according to which one could not measure the political system of Singapore with other 'normal countries', in view of that, it seemed invariably undemocratic.</seg>
<seg id="1699">On the other hand, he has defended the idea that Singapore should be compared with cities like Chicago, San Francisco or New York, equally cities which are permanently led by a party.</seg>
<seg id="1700">These cities are democratic.</seg>
<seg id="1701">Once one reaches the core point of the subject, the good old Lyre pops up from the authoritarian rulers to be democrats, leave the distorted logic, since it fits better to their power.</seg>
<seg id="1702">In the end, the answers given in the last week of Shanmugam were answers to his American guests regarding our press, our judicative, our political system really non-answers.</seg>
<seg id="1703">He camouflaged corresponding questions with non-answers in a rational manner.</seg>
<seg id="1704">Rachel Zeng calls on Shanmugam to clarify his opinion, since she did not understand this conclusion.</seg>
<seg id="1705">Personally, I find it a bit difficult to swallow.</seg>
<seg id="1706">If Singapore is not a country but a city, so to which country belongs our city...</seg>
<seg id="1707">In short, I don't understand anything.</seg>
<seg id="1708">I would be very grateful if our dear K Shanmugam would take the effort to clarify this point, as long as he was highly paid to be part of the government of the city of Singapore.</seg>
<seg id="1709">By publishing his comment on the blog, he points to the critics that you should start reading the whole transcript of the conference so that you can better understand the context of Shanmugam's statements, according to which Singapore is a city and not a country.</seg>
<seg id="1710">Read the transcript.</seg>
<seg id="1711">When he said that Singapore was rather a "city" than a country, "he explained why the elections in Singapore are so unimportant even if we enjoy free and fair elections.</seg>
<seg id="1712">He compared Singapore to cities in the USA (and how many of these cities saw a party for decades?).</seg>
<seg id="1713">When he said that Singapore is not a country, "he obviously did not mean it in this sense!</seg>
<seg id="1714">Clement Tan shows his disappointment about Shanmugam, the leader of a growing generation who makes such a polemical statement.</seg>
<seg id="1715">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "I am very embarrassed about what the Minister of Justice has said about Singapore." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1716">At least I knew with Lee Kuan Yew and the members of the old guard what I expected - whether I agree with them or not, but that's another thing.</seg>
<seg id="1717">But with K. Shanmugam, member of the new generation of the political leaders of Singapore, I have doubts and I am not even sure if he really believes it is properly associated and is aware of what he is defending.</seg>
<seg id="1718">The TEMASEK Review decomposes the weak points of Shanmugams's arguments:</seg>
<seg id="1719">Did Mr. Shanmugam "belive a mistake" or was it a sinner?</seg>
<seg id="1720">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "if Singapore is not a country, we are only considered an independent and sovereign state?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1721">If not, in which country do the sovereign rights of the city go back?</seg>
<seg id="1722">Singapore is unique, it is equally land and city.</seg>
<seg id="1723">Since he plays an important role within the cabinet cabinet, Mr. Shanmugam's statements are of serious importance.</seg>
<seg id="1724">Why do the people of Singapore help their military service, but don't they defend their city?</seg>
<seg id="1725">Who has to pay back our prime minister?</seg>
<seg id="1726">What is the value of our pink identity card?</seg>
<seg id="1727">Are we citizens of a country or the inhabitants of a city?</seg>
<seg id="1728">The Journal of the Journey of a Decade to affirm, Singapore is and was always a city:</seg>
<seg id="1729">"I didn't say what I said..."</seg>
<seg id="1730">This sentence seems to have annoyed many people of Singapore...</seg>
<seg id="1731">Nobody ever said that Singapore is a country.</seg>
<seg id="1732">We were always a city.</seg>
<seg id="1733">We have always been a city / island state.</seg>

<seg id="1780">A pop band, famous in Thailand, has published a music video which the junta paroys, which in 2014 seized power and, despite its promises to restore the civilian government, continues to rule the country.</seg>
<seg id="1781">The new song "Dictator Girl" (Phadet Girl) of the Tattoo Colour's band describes a young man telling what regulations his girlfriend makes for him.</seg>
<seg id="1782">Although not explicitly political, the music video refers indirectly to the continued military rule of the Junta.</seg>
<seg id="1783">The band was praised by many fans and other Internet users for their courage to describe the situation of the country.</seg>
<seg id="1784">The video to the song was a huge success.</seg>
<seg id="1785">Only within the first three days, the video uploaded on Facebook was 1,254 times shared and received 8,800 songs.</seg>
<seg id="1786">Last month, even the Charlie Chaplin video "Der Dictator" in Thailand was blocked after a group of activists requested the public to watch this video.</seg>
<seg id="1787">The video can be interpreted as a creative and entertaining introduction to Thai politics, especially as it behaves with the country's position under the rule of Junta.</seg>
<seg id="1788">Take a look at these videos of the video that relate to some of the political issues that Thailand has pursued over the past three years.</seg>
<seg id="1789">The "44 Rules of the Girls" may be related to the draconian section 44 of the provisional Constitution, which gives absolute discretion to the commander-in-chief of the army on important national issues.</seg>
<seg id="1790">The 11th Rule: "change your attitude" refers to the notorious programme for the "change of imagination" by journalists, students, scientists, activists, politicians and other individuals who are considered critics by the Junta.</seg>
<seg id="1791">The picture above reflects the introduction of the law on computer crime, whose vague and unclear regulations are often used by the authorities to arrest activists and other critics of the state.</seg>
<seg id="1792">For this purpose, a new unit was set up in the army which monitors the online content and prosecuted those accused of having slandered the monarchy.</seg>
<seg id="1793">Thailand implements a strikingly against "Read Majeste" (Majestic insult).</seg>
<seg id="1794">On 20 May 2014, the martial law was proclaimed in Thailand.</seg>
<seg id="1795">Two days later, it came to a coup d "état of the army.</seg>
<seg id="1796">One of the problems that the junta continues to pursue is their decision to buy expensive submarines, although security experts warned them that the purchase is unnecessary and a waste of tax payers.</seg>
<seg id="1797">In the video, it is even shown how people are thrown into a black van before putting them into an internment camp, another problem.</seg>
<seg id="1798">Some journalists are in prison because they allegedly caused "confusion" in society and Internet users are threatened with long prison sentences, they should offend the monarchy.</seg>
<seg id="1799">Meanwhile the teaser of the song showed members of the band who imitated the Salut from "The Tribute of Panem," which was already used by putsch opponents during the protests in 2014.</seg>

<seg id="1808">Various ethnic groups such as Russians, Greeks, Near-Asia, Georgians and Armenians lived and worked together in Soviet times in the area.</seg>
<seg id="1809">Many of them had to leave their homes during the war.</seg>
<seg id="1810">Today, the largest part of Russians and hares live in the area.</seg>
<seg id="1811">Such settlements are also called ghost towns in Abkhazia.</seg>
<seg id="1812">During the pre-war period more than 10,000 people lived here, today there are only a few hundred people in these ghost towns.</seg>
<seg id="1813">This phenomenon is characteristic of Tkuarchal.</seg>
<seg id="1814">Since 2011, the total population of the district has been 16.000 people after it has barely risen over a decade.</seg>
<seg id="1815">In 1989 about 43.000 people lived in this district.</seg>

<seg id="1831">The people who once lived in this place and made their contribution to the central planned economy of the Soviet Union have now left the district.</seg>

<seg id="1897">This article by Amy Bracken was published on April 19, 2017 on the website of our partner PRI.org and appears here with kind permission.</seg>
<seg id="1898">On the way of migrants crossing Europe or Latin America, certain places are known for their hospitality.</seg>
<seg id="1899">I visited one of these places in the Mexican city of Tapachula, it is located on the border to Guatemala.</seg>
<seg id="1900">It is a very simple hotel near the city center.</seg>
<seg id="1901">It is led by a 59-year-old Mexican woman, a small woman with a coral-pink spectacle frame and gold colored earrings in teddy bear form.</seg>
<seg id="1902">She is called Concepción González Ramírez and was born in Tapachula and grew up there. nevertheless, they know many under the name Mama Africa.</seg>
<seg id="1903">This nickname is due to the fact that the hotel (or rather it itself) has become a destination for Africans and Haitians who are on transit.</seg>
<seg id="1904">The hotel has no charm.</seg>
<seg id="1905">For about 2.50 dollars per night, guests sleep in simple rooms, with bare, crumbling walls and metal beds.</seg>
<seg id="1906">In the vestibule there is a parrot in a cage.</seg>
<seg id="1907">There is no sign to the hotel - however, hundreds of African and Haitian migrants arrive here.</seg>
<seg id="1908">Sometimes, Mrs Ramírez, the people come in full minibuses and from the upper part of the coast they begin to call: "Mama Africa!</seg>
<seg id="1909">Where are you Mama Africa? "</seg>
<seg id="1910">Currently it is rather quiet, but this year Ramírez already received 200 guests at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="1911">There are only 24 rooms, some of them already slept outside on cardboard boxes.</seg>
<seg id="1912">She doesn't want to reject anyone.</seg>
<seg id="1913">She also helps them and brings them to the hospital when they are ill, they buy them medication they can't pay, they massage them with a balm the feet exhausted by the long journey.</seg>
<seg id="1914">Tychque Sebastiao, originally from Angola, arrived recently.</seg>
<seg id="1915">I asked him if Mama Africa was an appropriate nickname for Ms. Ramírez.</seg>
<seg id="1916">The family Sebastiao (with her daughter Merrui, who has a yoghurtbart) posing with Concepción González Ramírez.</seg>
<seg id="1917">The family came from Angola to Brazil and hopes to go to Boston.</seg>
<seg id="1918">Photo: Amy Bracken.</seg>
<seg id="1919">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "yes, yes," "" "" "" "he answers with a smile." "" "" "" "I really feel that it suits her, as African women are very nice women." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1920">Very loving.</seg>
<seg id="1921">She has the warmth of a mother...</seg>
<seg id="1922">We feel very comfortable here. "</seg>
<seg id="1923">Sebastiao travels with his sister, hoping to go to Boston to find her husband and the three children.</seg>
<seg id="1924">They have lived in Brazil, but it is for some Africans who are on the way to the United States to make a first stop in South America and then move north.</seg>
<seg id="1925">The family had heard from other companions of Mama Africa. "Mama Africa is a well-known name on the track," explains Felix Michelet, a guest from Haiti.</seg>
<seg id="1926">He tells that Haitians and Africans often travel together and that Africans are already talking about Ms. Ramírez's Whatsapp.</seg>
<seg id="1927">As many of his companions, Michelet has lived in Brazil and worked as a construction worker for the construction sites of the Olympic Games and the World Cup.</seg>
<seg id="1928">When the Brazilian economy was weaker, he began his journey to the United States.</seg>
<seg id="1929">He has been a guest at Mama Africa for months: he sells SIM cards to save the necessary money in order to buy the bus ticket to Tijuana.</seg>
<seg id="1930">I wonder if he will get in touch with Mrs. Ramírez in the future.</seg>
<seg id="1931">"Mama Africa is our mother and we never leave her again," he answers smiling. "we will always stay in touch."</seg>
<seg id="1932">Ms. Ramírez tells her guests often send text messages when they are gone to greet them or to tell her about the course of her trip.</seg>
<seg id="1933">She explains that her Christian faith is the drive of her work.</seg>
<seg id="1934">She doesn't know much about Africa, but her guests have taught her to prepare chicken as in Ghana.</seg>
<seg id="1935">Ms. Ramírez is perhaps very well known here, but she is not the only spark of hope for the migrants who travel through Tapachula.</seg>
<seg id="1936">At the other end of the city a dead end leads to Jesús Valenzuela.</seg>
<seg id="1937">This winter, Valenzuela and his family have taken up migrants in their small house.</seg>
<seg id="1938">He is a policeman and has found that the bus tickets to numerous African immigrants are sold too expensive.</seg>
<seg id="1939">He has begun to help them get a reasonable price, then he offered them his house for a dollar the night.</seg>
<seg id="1940">At the moment there are 25 people, mainly Haitians.</seg>
<seg id="1941">Some sleep on the floor, but at least they have electricity, a washing machine and a cooking area outside.</seg>
<seg id="1942">Valenzuela explains that he knows what the guests are going through.</seg>
<seg id="1943">"I have lived in the United States," he says. "I have experienced what they are experiencing.</seg>
<seg id="1944">I crossed the border over the desert and we suffered.</seg>
<seg id="1945">"" "" "" "there are places where people don't help and others don't help. that's why I give them my support." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1946">After having lived for three years, he was expelled from the United States after a raid on his job.</seg>
<seg id="1947">The majority of migrants who travel through Tapachula comes from Central America, other inhabitants also open the doors of their homes for them.</seg>
<seg id="1948">José Antonio Cordova Meléndez tells me that he fled to Honduras with his wife and his three children, who wanted to blackmail him money without having a plan.</seg>
<seg id="1949">In Tapachula, he asked for an accommodation and an unknown, an all-in-one, offered him their roof.</seg>
<seg id="1950">A few months later, the family still lives and tries to decide where to go.</seg>
<seg id="1951">Back in the house of Mama Africa, everything is full of guests again.</seg>
<seg id="1952">In the aisles, the travellers are looking calmly into their phones.</seg>
<seg id="1953">A minibus arrived today and brought 20 new guests, a large part of Somalia.</seg>
<seg id="1954">Ms. Ramírez seems happy that her house is full, but she is also nostalgic because of those who have gone away.</seg>
<seg id="1955">She looks like a proud grandmother in her album with numerous photos.</seg>
<seg id="1956">There is one of her daughter with African hair-care that she has made a client, some photos of her grandchildren and many travelers more, young and old.</seg>
<seg id="1957">She laughs sadly as she presents her briefly.</seg>
<seg id="1958">"Ya'fueron," she repeats every time. "they have already gone."</seg>
<seg id="1959">China: Xinjiang residents are forced to install a monitoring app on their mobile phones.</seg>
<seg id="1960">A check-point for personal communication devices in Xinjang from Twitter users has been mastered.</seg>
<seg id="1961">The inhabitants of Xinjiang, an ethnic minority region in western China, are forced to install a spyware on their phones.</seg>
<seg id="1962">On July 10, mobile users in the Tianshan district of Urumqi received a cell phone notification in which it instructs the district government to install a monitoring app named Jingwang (or "Web Clean").</seg>
<seg id="1963">"" "" "" "in the message, it is said that the app" "" "" "" "prevents access to terrorist information." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1964">However, the authorities could use the App for more than combating terrorism.</seg>
<seg id="1965">According to an exclusive report by Radio Free Asia, 10 Kazakh women were arrested in the autonomous Ili Kazakh prefecture because, shortly after they had installed the app, they exchanged messages with a private chat group.</seg>
<seg id="1966">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "the police informed the police that the app would identify and track the sources and distribution channels of the terrorists along with" illegal religious "" "" "" "" activities and "" "" "" "" harmful information "" "" "" "" including videos, images, eBooks and documents. "" "" "" "</seg>
<seg id="1967">Jingwanang's website describes the app as follows:</seg>
<seg id="1968">Jingwang is a protection service with system categories for children and adults, introduced by Jiangsu Telecom.</seg>
<seg id="1969">The main feature is blocking pornographic websites, from online fraud, trojans and phishing sites to make users aware of how much time they spend online and remotely control their home network.</seg>
<seg id="1970">This app with filtering for minors is designed to help children develop a healthy lifestyle.</seg>
<seg id="1971">An app with these functions can of course be used in many ways.</seg>
<seg id="1972">For example, the "remote control" could enable government actors or even hackers to manipulate or steal the home network of a person.</seg>
<seg id="1973">This introduction is in line with other measures to control the digital activities in this region.</seg>
<seg id="1974">While messages about digital censorship in China mostly focus on the experiences of users in the larger cities in the east and south, reality is very often gloomy for those living in remote, crowded ethnic minority regions such as Xinjiang and Tibet.</seg>
<seg id="1975">In order to limit unrest and discontent in the conflict areas, the authorities often arrange extreme censorship and surveillance measures as well as routine Internet shutdowns.</seg>
<seg id="1976">The Twitter-based media outlets "Images from mainland China" (all of which have been mastered), the censored news published in China, showed photos from a checkpoint where police inspectors checked the people randomly to see if they had installed the surveillance app.</seg>
<seg id="1977">The authorities in Xinjian make sure people use the official Jingwang app.</seg>
<seg id="1978">Mobile notification required people to install the app within 10 days.</seg>
<seg id="1979">If you are detected at a checkpoint with a device without this software, they could be detained up to 10 days.</seg>
<seg id="1980">This is a setback for technological development.</seg>
<seg id="1981">They have forced people to use devices intended for older people.</seg>
<seg id="1982">This is a form of captivity by the rest-growth technology.</seg>
<seg id="1983">We are back in Maos China.</seg>
<seg id="1984">"images from mainland China" (all of which have been mastered) also published a Jingwang product description from which the software can raise the password request of a Windows operating system and thus get unlimited access to the hard drive of the computer.</seg>
<seg id="1985">After installing Jingwang, computer and mobile phones will become electronic handcuffs in Xinjiang.</seg>
<seg id="1986">The regulations in Jingwang might be a reaction to the instructions of the City Council, to minimise the dissemination of illegal contents.</seg>
<seg id="1987">All government branches, authorities and related institutions, including universities and research institutions, are obliged to follow the instructions of the Cybersecurity Office during the operation of their computers and communication devices.</seg>
<seg id="1988">A recent report by Freedom House, an American human rights organisation, also mentioned these new surveillance methods:</seg>
<seg id="1989">In Xinjiang, on June 27, in a district of the regional capital of Urumqi, the authorities issued orders to all residents and entrepreneurs to register their "personal ID cards, mobile phones, external drives, portable hard drives, notebooks and media memory cards" at the local police station.</seg>
<seg id="1990">The intention is obviously to identify and destroy any "terrorist videos." however, this action violates the rights of Urumquis's three million inhabitants and gives them penalties for a number of other possible offenses, including those relating to peaceful religious or political messages.</seg>

<seg id="1994">This is the first of six reports in the series "sleep or death" in which the activist Sarmad Al Jilane describes his experiences in a Syrian prison.</seg>
<seg id="1995">Far from our blue, virtual world, you look at yourself and realize that you are alone in a place where all important things have disappeared.</seg>

<seg id="1997">One that makes all honor to their name.</seg>
<seg id="1998">One that has knocked down into a list of feelings and expressions that do not allow metaphors.</seg>
<seg id="1999">But if the reality catches you back and you look behind the scenes - beyond the drama, the beautiful scenes and the performer - the characters transform into beings of flesh and blood, and everything cries out after death.</seg>
<seg id="2000">All doubts arise in smoke and you will be aware of your existence even if the earth is spinning on the axis of the evil. it becomes clear to you that you are trapped between the walls that your parents, and before them your grandparents, have built stone for stone.</seg>
<seg id="2001">They arrested me and my father three times, but that was not enough for me to "learn my lesson," as the chief of the security service put it down - with the promise that the fourth time would be a pleasure.</seg>
<seg id="2002">He proved his power over us by destroying even the simplest concepts we knew.</seg>
<seg id="2003">Five youths were ripped during a peaceful protest like weeds from the beautiful garden of our revolution.</seg>

<seg id="2005">All the neighborhoods were coveted, only my own.</seg>
<seg id="2006">For the first time it was quiet, motionless, at the wrong time, even if I had no high demands on a city that has been stuffed up to the arteries with state security organisms and their accomplices.</seg>

<seg id="2090">The Jordanian zapper Emsallam Hdaib talks about the rights of LGBTQ + community, freedom of expression and resistance</seg>
<seg id="2091">Emsallat Hdaib smokes a cigarette in his studio.</seg>
<seg id="2092">The photo was taken by Aman Madan, the original author of this text.</seg>
<seg id="2093">Emsallam Hdaib spends most of his time inside; sometimes he smiles to his screen, sometimes to his computer, sometimes and again to his couch.</seg>
<seg id="2094">But what you can rely on is a cigarette between his fingers or his lips infected with nicotine.</seg>
<seg id="2095">He lives on the top floor of his family house, which has belonged to them since 1967; the year in which Israel completed his occupation of the West Bank and Hdaibs family forced themselves to flee from their village in Palestine, in which they lived as sulphuryees (approximately: farmers).</seg>
<seg id="2096">For six years now, Hdaib has been a passionate activist who faces the conservative majority and questioned their established opinions on gender roles, sexuality and freedom of expression through art and rapeseed music.</seg>
<seg id="2097">With his music, which often deals with themes such as Orientalism, racism and the situation of Palestinian refugees, he also challenges the core of the entire Arab world. all these issues are not only relevant in his hometown of Amman, but also in cities that range from Damascus to Syria in Yemen.</seg>
<seg id="2098">At the age of 25, Hdaib sees himself as someone who is not limited by boundaries in his mind, and can feel according to his own statement with the people who suffer from the devastating consequences of foreign interventions in countries such as Iraq, Yemen, Syria and Libya.</seg>
<seg id="2099">Even if he does not openly admit it, he has a special reluctance to American foreign policy.</seg>
<seg id="2100">Hdaib looks at his art in his studio in Amman.</seg>
<seg id="2101">Recorded by the author.</seg>
<seg id="2102">Hdaib does not believe that his compassion for those who try to survive in war zones, have anything to do with his identity as "Palestinian refugees of the second generation," he calls himself, even though he was born in Jordan and has never been in Palestine.</seg>
<seg id="2103">"I don't think about my own circumstances," Hdaib emphasizes.</seg>
<seg id="2104">Then he adds: "I think so because I'm a man," while he pours out nescafé in water in two cups. it's the holy month of Ramadan; at that time it is intended for Muslims to fast from sunrise to sunset.</seg>
<seg id="2105">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "the Jordanian law also states that the public consumption of food is illegal during the Ramadan." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2106">Obviously Hdaib has a certain weakness for breaking with ancient traditions; on the other hand, having a cup of coffee on a scorching hot junk day has little to do with protest against Islam.</seg>
<seg id="2107">In principle, the swarms of lukewarm coffee and the squadron of the Kent-cigarette in the nose speak primarily of freedom.</seg>
<seg id="2108">Sometimes Jordan is like a prison in the open sky, especially if you have a look at the neighbouring countries.</seg>
<seg id="2109">Therefore it is easy to do basic things - as in the public during Ramadan to drink water - in order not to land in prison.</seg>
<seg id="2110">Recently the Ministry of the Interior has cancelled a performance by the band Mashrou'Leila, already for the second time.</seg>
<seg id="2111">Some parliamentarians who support the Islamic action front - the Jordanian branch of the Muslim Brotherhood - argued that the sexual orientation of the homosexual front-singer, Hamed Sinno, contradicts the country's cultural and traditional norms and is the main reason for the concert.</seg>
<seg id="2112">The deputy and former spokeswoman of the Islamic coalition Dima Tahboub said in an interview with CNN that the concert "just" had been canceled because of the sexual orientation of the singer.</seg>
<seg id="2113">Many also claim that the engagement of the band in matters such as the Arab Spring, human rights and free expression in the Arab world is dangerous activism, which question the old proven legitimacy of authoritarian regimes across the region.</seg>
<seg id="2114">In a public statement, Mashrou'Leila estimated the Jordanian people as "progressive supporters of human rights," who continue to use "for intellectual and cultural pluralism."</seg>
<seg id="2115">This statement might not be simply shallow rhetoric, but actually reflect an increasingly clear crystallizing reality in Jordan which appears clearly in Hdaibs's work.</seg>
<seg id="2116">In 2016, Hdaib returned traditional gender standards by making his vision of the fate of Arab women who have premarital sex.</seg>
<seg id="2117">The picture shows the skeleton of an apparently lowered unknown woman whose arms and legs stretch up to the corners of the screen.</seg>
<seg id="2118">It is surrounded by a red lake; perhaps the blood of the countless women who have lost their lives through the hands of those they should actually trust.</seg>
<seg id="2119">In the past few years, the number of 'honourable murders' has increased in Jordan - the unofficial outside.</seg>
<seg id="2120">According to Human Rights Watch, the number of voluntary murders reached its peak in 2016; however, it is still aggravating that Jordan lacks the institutional infrastructure to support the women who have attempted murder or domestic violence in an appropriate way.</seg>
<seg id="2121">According to a Act on Crime of Crime from 1954, women who are exposed to the risk of domestic violence can "be detained at an indefinite time in prison," and for their release it is often necessary for years of bureaucratic expenditures as well as the guarantee on the part of the family that nothing will happen to the woman.</seg>
<seg id="2122">Hdaib's music is also very popular and is known to shy away from issues that have long been considered taboo in his country.</seg>
<seg id="2123">Hdaib denies that his work is political, but admits that he cannot separate his music, which is full of explicit references to sexuality, freedom and expression.</seg>
<seg id="2124">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "I come from the Middle East, man." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2125">I was attached to politics, "he says.</seg>
<seg id="2126">In a song called "Edward Sa'ed," Hdaib tackles the question of Palestinian identity.</seg>
<seg id="2127">"" "" "" "in" "" "" "" "Lawla al 3aib" "" "" "" "and in" Ghareeb "" "" "" "" the focus is on poverty. "" "" "" "</seg>
<seg id="2128">The list of songs that are political at the core can be continued.</seg>
<seg id="2129">In March 2016, Hdaib published a song entitled "Santandano."</seg>
<seg id="2130">In this song, a verse often repeats itself:</seg>
<seg id="2131">"you are free, and everyone else is."</seg>
<seg id="2132">In the further course of the song Hdaib describes the world as a kind of market on which one, in his words, "can get what you want" - be it faith or non-belief, hetero- or homosexuality.</seg>
<seg id="2133">He notices that hardly anyone in Jordan is talking about the rights of gay people and lesbians and that comments on equality between LGBTQ + individuals have been strongly censored until 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2134">In 2014, Hdaib presented an interview for the popular Jordanian online program Roya to later memorize that his comments were torn out of context, distorted and censored in his opinion.</seg>
<seg id="2135">"it was uploaded to Youtube without cuts, but only a modified version," he says.</seg>
<seg id="2136">Today, Hdaib is openly campaigning for the Arab LGBTQ + community and believes that intolerance to homosexuals does not correspond to Islam.</seg>
<seg id="2137">He mentions Abu Nuwhat, a poet of the eighth century, who still remains in memory thanks to his homoerotic poems.</seg>
<seg id="2138">Hdaib asks: if Abu Nuwhat, who later should work on behalf of the caliph, could write openly about homosexuality in the eighth century, why can Jordanians not do that?</seg>
<seg id="2139">The real problem, so Hdaib, has nothing to do with Mashrou'Leila or the fact that the concert was cancelled.</seg>
<seg id="2140">In the hashemian kingdom there is nothing new that the government sanction attacks on freedom of expression and that progressive voices are silenced.</seg>
<seg id="2141">More recently, in January 2017, the Jordanian Intelligence Service determined several former government officials and members of the educational association with the reason that they have critically criticised the issues related to corruption in the country.</seg>
<seg id="2142">In view of this, Hdaibs's opinion is just the tip of the iceberg - the real challenge is to bring about a structural change in the next generation of Jordanians.</seg>
<seg id="2143">For him progress is a constant giving and taking. Jordan has performed Mashrou'Leila for the second time in a row, but the path of progress - that is Hdaib - consists of slow, deliberate and inner changes. he is sure that these changes take place from day to day in the heart of the Jordanian society.</seg>
<seg id="2144">In the end Hdaib, like millions of other Arabs, dreams of an Arab world without intervention from abroad.</seg>
<seg id="2145">He does not only dream of bringing his work to Baghdad, Jerusalem and Damascus, but also to "experience it."</seg>
<seg id="2146">Perhaps the region will approach a genuine and fundamental openness by means of music, art and literature - and not through bombs, cluster munitions and artificially induced democracies. at least he hopes that.</seg>
<seg id="2147">As far as this is done, Hdaib will continue racking and thus resisting resistance.</seg>
<seg id="2148">This report was made possible by the Pulitzer Center on Crisis Reporting, which Aman belongs to as a student Fellow.</seg>
<seg id="2149">Nebuta in Aomori is one of the 3 largest festivals in Japan.</seg>
<seg id="2150">These big, extravagant warps are so fantastic!!!</seg>
<seg id="2151">There are numerous theories regarding the origin of the Nebuta festival.</seg>
<seg id="2152">One assumes that there is a variation of the Tanabata Festival, which is usually also celebrated in many areas of Tohokus in August. another theory states that the feats, the drums and dancing have been handed over more than a thousand years and come from a time when armies swept from the west of Japan to the northeast to force the indigenous people of the region, the emisshi, to the knees.</seg>
<seg id="2153">We are at the Nebuta festival in Aomori.</seg>
<seg id="2154">We were able to grab some great seats, so we have a great view.</seg>
<seg id="2155">One can only imagine how large these parts are...</seg>
<seg id="2156">A joint centre in the capital city, Meguro Gaelen, hosted a two-month exhibition to Wa no Akari (literally.</seg>
<seg id="2157">I have been looking forward to the Meguro Gyoen for a long time: two fixed cars are just to be seen.</seg>
<seg id="2158">Nevertheless, for many people who take the trip to Aomori, the Nebuta festival is the only true - and still a breathtaking way to spend his summer:</seg>
<seg id="2159">"Yattemare!</seg>

<seg id="2167">Rarely external appearance and personal care were as important as in this story, as they help to keep the Peruvian youth out of crime and to promote a legitimate profession like the hairdresser's.</seg>
<seg id="2168">El Callao, Peru's most important port, is located on the coast of the Pacific Ocean, close to the historic center of Lima - a region with a very high crime rate where street robbery and illegal drug trade are all-day.</seg>
<seg id="2169">A survey published in April 2017 showed that 51.5 percent of the population in this region will not feel safe.</seg>
<seg id="2170">At the same time Peru - like many other Central and South American countries - experiences an increasing demand for aesthetic services for men.</seg>
<seg id="2171">The trend, the appearance and thus also the unusual hairstyles of famous sportsmen such as Paolo Guerrero (Peru), Arturo Vidal (Chile), Pedro Gallese (Peru), or Neymar (Brazil) have led to the fact that more and more normal citizens go into the experienced hands of hairdressers who can recreate these elaborate hairstyles.</seg>
<seg id="2172">The unprecedented demand for hairstyles that go to the extreme limits of imagination and creativity has even inspired an annual event, the competition of hairdressers "Batalla de Barberos," which has been taking place since 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2173">There experts join each other to show who of them can create the most eccentric looks as you can see in the following video (more videos on current competitions are available on the public Facebook profile Batalla de Barberos).</seg>
<seg id="2174">Educational institutions such as the school Augusto Salazar Bondy, located in El Callao, found here an opportunity to convince young people to exchange their weapons against hairdressing tools and to get training in hair style instead of bad advice, which allows them to find work.</seg>
<seg id="2175">Motivated by this activity and the opportunities offered, dozens of young people have seen that they can take a job that is currently in fashion.</seg>
<seg id="2176">Before the school year beginning in March, the school offered special training workshops and reported on some of its successes:</seg>
<seg id="2177">In 1995, we were the only school in the municipality and the district where we are very proud, because we have built this educational community out of love for the children.</seg>
<seg id="2178">Colombia: letter of Love to guerilla fighters</seg>
<seg id="2179">Photo: Valentina Monsalve.</seg>
<seg id="2180">Use with friendly authorization.</seg>
<seg id="2181">The following article is the edited version of the "Love message to guerilla fighters," published by the international online magazine Tea After Twelve.</seg>
<seg id="2182">The contribution will be published here as part of a partnership with Global Voices.</seg>
<seg id="2183">Why do we only write love letters to people we know?</seg>
<seg id="2184">Isn't it much more important to accommodate people who feel excreted?</seg>
<seg id="2185">Exactly this question left the young Colombian activist Leonardo Párraga von der Bogota and Cristian Palacios from the Young-Youth Foundation and inspired them to the campaign of Carta por la Reconciliación (Letters to Reconciliation), encouraging young people to write letters to guerrilla fighters.</seg>
<seg id="2186">Only recently, their country was the scene of a historic event and they wanted to contribute their part: after years of negotiations, the Colombian government had concluded a peace treaty with the guerrilla movement FARC (German: revolutionary armed forces), which forms the conclusion of the longest armed conflict in Latin America.</seg>
<seg id="2187">The signing of the peace treaty was considered to be so significant that the Colombian president José Manuel Santos received the Nobel Peace Prize for his merits.</seg>
<seg id="2188">However, before the Colombian people there is still a long way to talk about real reconciliation and peace.</seg>
<seg id="2189">Guerrilla fighters who lived in illegal camps for many years, were exposed to a war rhetoric and carried arms around the clock, must now integrate themselves into life as civilians.</seg>
<seg id="2190">The Colombian society, again accustomed to life in constant fear and in some cases of deep hatred of guerrilla fighters, must now take it into their ranks and support them in the construction of a new life.</seg>
<seg id="2191">Leonardo and Cristian were convinced that the young Colombians could join together and help in the integration process.</seg>
<seg id="2192">And that's exactly what they did: until now, thousands of young people have already written letters - messages to former guerilla fighters to welcome them back to society.</seg>
<seg id="2193">The aim of the campaign is 6900 letters - one for every former guerilla fighter - to be handed over personally.</seg>
<seg id="2194">Valentine's Day as an inspiration for the campaign</seg>
<seg id="2195">The idea for the letters to reconciliation was created at the World Summit of Nobel Peace Laureates, which took place in Bogotá in February 2017. there, Leonardo and Cristian had the opportunity to speak shortly with Kailash Satyarthi, which was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2196">This explained that we write thousands of love letters on Valentine's Day, but forget those who need them much more.</seg>
<seg id="2197">He plans to share his love with people this year, who needed most urgently.</seg>
<seg id="2198">Thus the plan was to write letters full of hope and support for former FARC fighters who have now to find their place in society and build up a new life. "the letters will show that the Colombian society is ready to make the discourse of a history of war a common history of peace," they say.</seg>
<seg id="2199">Until now, more than 2,000 letters have been collected during the campaign.</seg>
<seg id="2200">The initiative is represented in all major cities such as Cali, Manicales, Medellín, Barranquilla and Bogotá.</seg>
<seg id="2201">'i never thought that someone would forgive me '</seg>
<seg id="2202">The first 500 letters were handed over to one of the UN camps in the region of Caldono-Cauca on March 19.</seg>
<seg id="2203">A group of 40 students from Javeriana University in Cali, two members of the Municipality of Cali and Leonardo from the Bogota Foundation travelled to the camp to personally transfer the letters.</seg>
<seg id="2204">The members of the FARC were as they had done earlier in order to receive the orders of their leaders.</seg>
<seg id="2205">But this time they received no orders, but letters full of support from people from all over the country.</seg>
<seg id="2206">It was a very moving moment for all involved. "it is unbelievable how many different feelings one can go through in just a few hours - from fear to happiness, and all that lies in between," said the political science student Manuela Jiménez Avila later.</seg>
<seg id="2207">Sandra Parra, an employee of the Governor of the province of Valle del Cauca described this unforgettable experience:</seg>
<seg id="2208">After passing the letters, a former fighter led me through the camp of the guerrilla fighters.</seg>
<seg id="2209">When I saw in one of the "Cambuches" (a kind of hut in which the guerrilla fighters live) I saw a guerilla fighter who wrote something.</seg>
<seg id="2210">I was afraid to go down, because next to him on the bed there was a mosquito net, a deadly weapon in the Sleeping Palace.</seg>
<seg id="2211">"" "" "" "he said," "" "" "" "Hello, what are they doing?" "" "" "" "he replied," "" "" "" "I answer a letter someone has written to me." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2212">It is a very nice and hopeful letter.</seg>
<seg id="2213">Never in my life has someone written such a beautiful thing to me, therefore I answer it. "suddenly tears ran over the cheeks.</seg>
<seg id="2214">I hugged him completely and put me next to the pomegranates.</seg>
<seg id="2215">Perhaps he was sorry for the war, I was sorry to be all the years of the faithful companion of this warrior, and wanted to help him write this letter.</seg>
<seg id="2216">The man told me more about his life. he had never expected something different from life than war. to join the FARC was the only way to preserve him and his six brothers before the Hungertod. "I never thought anyone would forgive me for my mistakes.</seg>
<seg id="2217">But now I know that there is a society outside that waits for us with open arms.</seg>
<seg id="2218">Until now I have only learned how to deal with weapons.</seg>
<seg id="2219">"" "" "" "but now where peace reigns, I can learn many things and work in dignity." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2220">New voices and voices</seg>
<seg id="2221">To start with, students and some of the FARC leaders joined a discussion group.</seg>
<seg id="2222">The students were all grown up as already war and the FARC was already in secret.</seg>
<seg id="2223">That is why the leaders of the FARC declared the history of the organisation, their ideals, and gave insight into their views on the peace process: "for many years we have witnessed the social injustice done by the state to the whole Colombian people. now, where we have the opportunity to develop ourselves into a political party, we can help shape society in this country more just.</seg>
<seg id="2224">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "a goal of this magnitude is to overcome all obstacles," "" "" "" "said one of them." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2225">Manuela was impressed:</seg>
<seg id="2226">To hear these people who have never heard their hearing and had no right to choose, and to realize that the people I have often seen as a monster and even hated even people with beautiful feelings turned upside down by their circumstances and their environment was very painful for me.</seg>
<seg id="2227">The reality in which the country lives is hurting me.</seg>
<seg id="2228">But it comforts me that all people - including those who have killed and have done so much damage, can teach us something and give a smile and a hug.</seg>
<seg id="2229">Many former fighters have responded to the letters.</seg>
<seg id="2230">Gustavo González, the camp's commander in Caldono-Cauca, wrote the following letter, for example, Darío de Jesús Monsalve, Archbishop of the town of Cali:</seg>
<seg id="2231">The Colombian people were prophesied that peace would reign after disarmament.</seg>
<seg id="2232">But that is not the case.</seg>
<seg id="2233">As long as there is inequality, hunger and lack of education, health care and employment opportunities, there will always be people ready to resort to arms, to rise and protest for their rights. and that is also completely justified (...).</seg>
<seg id="2234">We at the FARC now focus on peace, on a policy without weapons.</seg>
<seg id="2235">That is why we call on all defenders of peace - no matter what race, religion or ideology they belong - to rise above all those who dream of a country in war.</seg>
<seg id="2236">We give you our word, make our contribution and offer sacrifices, for we know from our own experience that nothing is easy. those of us who defend life as the basis of existence will face many difficulties.</seg>
<seg id="2237">There will be many obstacles on our way, but together we will overcome them.</seg>

<seg id="2259">While I tried to help her, someone from whom I thought he would be a friend, a copy of my documents and spread it all over the internet, with my phone number and a picture of me. he sent her to his Chechen friends, with the following message: "then there are no men in Chechnya that can eliminate this shame?"</seg>
<seg id="2260">After that, the photos from my documents made the rounds through WhatsApp.</seg>
<seg id="2261">On 10 October 2015 I was attacked.</seg>
<seg id="2262">When I was about to bring out a few shopping bags from the back seat of my car, I heard a man's voice saying: "here is a gift for you from your uncle."</seg>
<seg id="2263">When I turned around, I felt something in my body, but I didn't hurt.</seg>
<seg id="2264">"" "" "" "then I heard one sentence, but this time in Chechnya:" "" "" "" "how long will you still honor the family, you Schandfleck?" "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2265">I didn't know the person.</seg>
<seg id="2266">I only know that it was a young man, not 30 years old.</seg>
<seg id="2267">Then I lost consciousness and woke up again in the hospital.</seg>
<seg id="2268">Apparently some women had received everything and started crying.</seg>
<seg id="2269">The man was fled.</seg>
<seg id="2270">The women had called a ambulance.</seg>
<seg id="2271">In the hospital I learned that I had two patches in my right lung.</seg>
<seg id="2272">OC Media: in which cases have you been laid - in the men or the women?</seg>
<seg id="2273">Sabrina: my documents are dated, there is still my male name on it; but the doctor understood and put me to the women.</seg>
<seg id="2274">I am very grateful to him for that.</seg>
<seg id="2275">When I read his name for the first time in his office, I got to do it with fear; it was a Muslim, a Caucasian name.</seg>
<seg id="2276">But he turned out to be a good person.</seg>
<seg id="2277">I am grateful to him for having dealt with me respectfully.</seg>
<seg id="2278">I spent more than a month in hospital.</seg>
<seg id="2279">Last February I received threats.</seg>
<seg id="2280">They called me, wrote to me - relatives, strangers, some completely unknown.</seg>
<seg id="2281">That was the beginning of a nightmare.</seg>
<seg id="2282">My family was visited by neighbors and some distant relatives.</seg>
<seg id="2283">They demanded to send me back to Chechnya to prove that it was all a lie.</seg>
<seg id="2284">They presented absurd demands: some told me that I must prove it by running up without the streets; others wanted me to appear on official TV in Grozny and say that I had not changed my sex that everything was just bad, and Photoshop.</seg>
<seg id="2285">I have size C - what would I have to say on TV?</seg>
<seg id="2286">OC Media: how did your family try to deal with this pressure?</seg>
<seg id="2287">Sabrina: it's still difficult for her.</seg>
<seg id="2288">Some elderly people once spoke to my mother on the street.</seg>
<seg id="2289">"" "" "" "they said to her," "" "" "" "You have brought a monster to the world that has corrupted not only your family, but the whole republic." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2290">"" "" "" "we cannot touch you because you are a pious woman, but you have to disappear from here." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2291">My mother became too much and she put a rope around her neck.</seg>
<seg id="2292">Luckily the neighbours came and saved them.</seg>
<seg id="2293">At the time I had to change the apartment several times a day.</seg>
<seg id="2294">I moved to an apartment and a few hours later, under the window a car with darkened windows and a number plate with a 95 mm.</seg>
<seg id="2295">After it happened the third time, I realized that there was a bit lazy.</seg>
<seg id="2296">My human rights friends checked the number plates - it turned out that I was persecuted.</seg>
<seg id="2297">OC Media: how did you fly?</seg>
<seg id="2298">Sabrina: with the help of activists.</seg>
<seg id="2299">For security reasons I don't want to reveal their names, but I want to say that I remember them all; they really helped me.</seg>
<seg id="2300">With their help I left the country, but then something incredible happened.</seg>
<seg id="2301">I can still not understand how it could be.</seg>
<seg id="2302">Shortly before I left Moscow, I bought a new SIM card to call my mother once I arrived.</seg>
<seg id="2303">I bought it without registering myself, without reference, without everything.</seg>
<seg id="2304">I broke my old SIM card and threw it into garbage.</seg>
<seg id="2305">Arrived and checked into the hotel.</seg>
<seg id="2306">The number was registered to a stranger.</seg>
<seg id="2307">I put the SIM card into my mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="2308">The moment I wanted to call my mother via WhatsApp, I got a message: "you don't think you're in security just because you left the country?</seg>
<seg id="2309">Our people already know in which hotel you are stuck. you even know your room number.</seg>
<seg id="2310">Just to prove it to you: it is the number 115. "</seg>
<seg id="2311">Can you imagine this?!</seg>
<seg id="2312">That was actually my room number.</seg>
<seg id="2313">OC Media: are you still in touch with your family?</seg>
<seg id="2314">Sabrina: only with my mother and my sisters.</seg>
<seg id="2315">But we don't talk about the gender equation, that's a taboo theme.</seg>
<seg id="2316">I still carry some traditional Caucasian elements in me.</seg>
<seg id="2317">As much as I wish, I can't overcome this mental barrier.</seg>
<seg id="2318">I always say that as long as my mother is alive, I will do my best to not hurt her.</seg>
<seg id="2319">When we chat with camera, I actually try to look like the person she remembers from her past - so to my male form.</seg>
<seg id="2320">But that is very difficult.</seg>
<seg id="2321">OC Media: do you know something about the current situation in Chechnya?</seg>
<seg id="2322">What do your friends do, those who have stayed there?</seg>
<seg id="2323">Sabrina: I filed a report in Washington last week.</seg>
<seg id="2324">For this I needed up-to-date information on the situation in Chechnya.</seg>
<seg id="2325">"" "" "" "I talked to someone who has been in gun in gun for one and a half months." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2326">He said that during Ramadan, no people were arrested and tortured, but also that all the end of Ramadan could hardly wait, and he did not lock a new wave.</seg>
<seg id="2327">Most likely, they will now focus on family and relatives.</seg>
<seg id="2328">With this I mean, they probably charge the relatives, they take care of the problem with the person concerned and at the end ask for proof that the so-called "honor" has experienced through blood satisfaction.</seg>
<seg id="2329">OC Media: are gay men still trapped in these secret prisons?</seg>
<seg id="2330">Sabrina: a friend of mine says that there were not so many.</seg>
<seg id="2331">If then, above all those who have no rich relatives or who have been dropped by their relatives in order to set up Kadyrows's judgment.</seg>
<seg id="2332">As far as I know, they are held there so that they can be presented later as terrorists.</seg>
<seg id="2333">Say: if they are killed, they will show their bodies on television and claim they have attacked any village or military base.</seg>
<seg id="2334">Do you understand?</seg>
<seg id="2335">As if these people were not simply disappeared, they were deliberately submerged in order to radicalise.</seg>
<seg id="2336">OC Media: is this just a guess or do you have a source for this information?</seg>
<seg id="2337">Sabrina: I just quote someone who was imprisoned in gun for one and a half months.</seg>
<seg id="2338">He says that many people have gone missing in this prison after their beard grew.</seg>
<seg id="2339">There was nothing new about them ever since.</seg>
<seg id="2340">They just took it along.</seg>
<seg id="2341">And this so-called Lord, this person was even present when these people were taken.</seg>
<seg id="2342">Up to now, however, they were not presented as bandits, but there have been no reports yet. we suspect that such actions are quite possible.</seg>
<seg id="2343">Why else wouldn't it have allowed these people to shave?</seg>
<seg id="2344">Do you know whether these persecutions and kidnappings of people belonging to so-called "non-traditional" orientation have already taken place in the past?</seg>
<seg id="2345">Sabrina: I always wore my hair long.</seg>
<seg id="2346">In Chechnya I had a Bob.</seg>
<seg id="2347">I think I was already known in Grozny before 2003 when I was still living there - and I never had any problems.</seg>
<seg id="2348">In earnest!</seg>
<seg id="2349">Even from 1998 to 1999, when the Sharia was applied, I never had any problems.</seg>
<seg id="2350">On the contrary, it was much safer at that time than now.</seg>
<seg id="2351">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "Russia originally intended to bring us to the" "" "" "" "civilisation" "" "" "", "but finally dropped us back to the Stone Age." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2352">OC Media: how is it possible under the Sharia law?</seg>
<seg id="2353">Sabrina: my eyebrows were plucking; I had colored lashes, bore tubes and short stops.</seg>
<seg id="2354">The security ministry of the Sharia never curved me a hair.</seg>
<seg id="2355">In front of the Russian theatre in Grozny there was a place where every evening, especially on weekends, met a whole group of people like me.</seg>
<seg id="2356">It was a small place where several benches were standing, and the whole city knew about it; they knew why men, young people, met there.</seg>
<seg id="2357">We were never offended.</seg>
<seg id="2358">In the Chechen language there is a saying: Khardah Kharda. that is, "Don't worry about the misfortune of another."</seg>
<seg id="2359">It is often said to be children when they make fun of the sick.</seg>
<seg id="2360">OC Media: so they simply closed their eyes to you because they believed you were ill?</seg>
<seg id="2361">Sabrina: yes.</seg>
<seg id="2362">They never offended me, never hunted and never smitten me.</seg>
<seg id="2363">OC Media: how long did this time of grace last?</seg>
<seg id="2364">Sabrina: as long as Kadyrov came to the plan.</seg>
<seg id="2365">When he was appointed Prime Minister in 2005, he began to speak on morals on television.</seg>
<seg id="2366">He did not speak about us per se, but primarily about the behavior of women.</seg>
<seg id="2367">Nevertheless, one could feel how the people in the city began to change.</seg>
<seg id="2368">Those who had smiled before and laughed at once saw you with suspicion.</seg>
<seg id="2369">In time I left Chechnya.</seg>
<seg id="2370">But every time I came back home I could feel the situation in the Republic deteriorated steadily.</seg>
<seg id="2371">OC Media: what activity do you have to do now?</seg>
<seg id="2372">Sabrina: I work as a waitress.</seg>
<seg id="2373">I do not earn a lot - 700 to 800 dollars per month are not much in the US.</seg>
<seg id="2374">Apart from that, I still work as an activist.</seg>
<seg id="2375">Currently I am responsible for 15 Muslim women.</seg>
<seg id="2376">I communicate with them as a kind of psychologist.</seg>
<seg id="2377">We organize tea riffs, gatherings, I accompany them to the hospital and help them get food cards.</seg>
<seg id="2378">I don't have a cent for it for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="2379">I discovered these people themselves when I took refuge.</seg>
<seg id="2380">I am Muslim and want to help those who need help.</seg>
<seg id="2381">OC Media: do you wear a Hiddenab?</seg>
<seg id="2382">Sabrina: that's silly.</seg>
<seg id="2383">So nature is, that has nothing to do with religion.</seg>
<seg id="2384">This is exactly the same as Chechens, who want to make you white with foam in front of the mouth, that there are no gays with them.</seg>
<seg id="2385">The Dagestanters who have the cabarins who, the Russians too, have what; on the whole planet, there are them - but "not in Chechnya."</seg>
<seg id="2386">I'm from there, so it's unpleasant to hear something like that.</seg>
<seg id="2387">I meet so many men from the Caucasus here.</seg>
<seg id="2388">Many of them - practicing Muslims who go to the mosque and fasting during Ramadan - live together with men.</seg>
<seg id="2389">Know, many think about transitions to men who love men, and they believe that you change their sex to make more intimate experiences. but that's a fallacy.</seg>
<seg id="2390">These are two different things - two different ways of feeling to be precise, different life settings.</seg>
<seg id="2391">For me it is the most important thing to feel in my own skin and not to be ashamed of my body.</seg>
<seg id="2392">Not if I have a partner or not.</seg>
<seg id="2393">Sorry I'm going to be so personal here, but my last intimate relationship is now more than a year ago.</seg>
<seg id="2394">And I'm not sad at all - I just know that I am now myself.</seg>
<seg id="2395">Local groups warn of an increase in suicide within the impoverished Arab Ahrazi community in Iran</seg>
<seg id="2396">The Iranian Ahraz region is suffering from an unusually high unemployment and poverty rate within the native Arab population.</seg>
<seg id="2397">Since the last few months there has been a strong increase in suicide.</seg>
<seg id="2398">The photo of the Arab workers in Iran was provided by the Patriotic Arab Democratic Movement in Ahraz.</seg>
<seg id="2399">Photo: use with permission.</seg>
<seg id="2400">The self-incineration of a man named Yassim Moramazi on 27 August returned the desperate situation of the Arab Ahrazi community in Iran, which is shaped by poverty and unemployment, into the spotlight.</seg>
<seg id="2401">Moramazi was married and had a child; he lived in Al-Thawra in the Ahraz region in the south-west of Iran.</seg>
<seg id="2402">He suffered from anxiety, depression, and he was ashamed for his own helplessness, the inability of his family to rise, so Ahwazi human rights groups who want to work in Ahraz and remain anonymous.</seg>
<seg id="2403">A video shared on YouTube kept the moments after he had lit himself.</seg>
<seg id="2404">Some people quickly managed to erase the flames, and Moramazi was brought to the Taleghani hospital in the town of Ahwaz.</seg>
<seg id="2405">According to local sources, the burns were so strong that doctors were unable to do anything.</seg>
<seg id="2406">He died shortly afterwards.</seg>
<seg id="2407">It was not the only suicide that happened in August within the Arab Ahrazi Minority, and activists on the ground warn that even more men could take life.</seg>
<seg id="2408">The Ahwazi Centre for Human Rights reported that several others - Hamid Maniat, Ali Hazbawi, Sayed Falah Moussawi and Shahab Bani Tamim - were hanging.</seg>
<seg id="2409">Their stories have one thing in common: they were all family fathers who felt helpless because of the persecution by the Iranian government, helpless and incapable of feeding their families and pursuing a safe work.</seg>
<seg id="2410">Arab Ahrazi suffer from poverty, unemployment and discrimination</seg>
<seg id="2411">The region where a large part of the Arab Ahrazi community living in Iran has been shaken by a profound economic crisis that makes it difficult for the native Arab population to deny its living.</seg>
<seg id="2412">A century ago, the Arab Ahraz was a predominantly autonomous region in Iran until the Pahlavi monarchy assumed power and undertook great efforts in 1925 to end ethnic autonomy throughout Iran.</seg>
<seg id="2413">In the Ahwaz region, there are some of the largest oil and gas fields occurring in Iran, as well as some of the most profitable and valuable uses for Iranian agriculture.</seg>
<seg id="2414">Despite these valuable resources, the regional economy continues to develop slowly, and the local population only gets little of this wealth.</seg>
<seg id="2415">It is often the victim of untreated illnesses, hunger and deprivation.</seg>
<seg id="2416">The Iranian regime systematically refuses to create jobs in the local oil, gas and petrochemical industries.</seg>
<seg id="2417">The government has also built a large number of dams, the water from the Arab areas into the Persian areas, where the provinces Isfahan, Yazd, Kerman and Ghom lie.</seg>
<seg id="2418">These dams have only led to aggravating the devastation caused by drought in the region, and to destroy the local farming as well as the fish and palm industry.</seg>
<seg id="2419">The unemployment rate among the Arab ahawks has now risen to 81%.</seg>
<seg id="2420">Nour Mohammed Pur, the Iranian General Director of Cooperatives, Labour and Social Welfare, reported that 5% of Ahwazis, who are looking for a job, completed primary school, completed 55% of a secondary school and 45% have a university degree.</seg>
<seg id="2421">A "systematic strategy... aimed at exterminating the spirit of national resistance"</seg>
<seg id="2422">Karim Dohimi, an Iranian Ahrazi human rights activist living in London, told Global Voices that the current situation, a mix of "poverty, unemployment and racist ethnic discrimination," led to a "high rise" of the number of suicide among young Ahrazi men.</seg>
<seg id="2423">Dohimi said that especially unemployment has become worse. the reason for this is a combination of a high number of ethnic Persians and an anti-Arab discrimination in the recruitment process:</seg>
<seg id="2424">Since officials and institutions do not prefers to hire Arab workers, the local Arab Ahrazi is deprived of access to employment opportunities in all sectors.</seg>
<seg id="2425">This is part of a systematic policy of the ruling regime, which aims to destroy the spirit of national resistance by young Arabs and force them to earn their living outside their native country of Ahraz.</seg>
<seg id="2426">There are people who had to change their first and last name to hide their affiliation to the Ahrazi, and to be hired as even Arab names in the workplace are not tolerated, let alone speak the Arabic language or wearing Arabic clothing.</seg>
<seg id="2427">Given the circumstances that the Arab Ahrazi have to endure, human rights abuses strike alarm before the situation becomes explosive.</seg>
<seg id="2428">It remains to be seen whether the world wakes up and takes notice of it.</seg>
<seg id="2429">The main reason for suicide is untreated depression.</seg>
<seg id="2430">Depression is treatable and suicide is avoidable.</seg>

<seg id="2435">The following article is a revised version of the opinion written by Ayomide Zuri and was originally published on the website Afroféminas. the article was the subject of several discussions in which many different positions came to expression.</seg>
<seg id="2436">You can read in the comments below the original text.</seg>
<seg id="2437">When I say that I am not a feminist, many women - especially white women, who call themselves intersectional feminists - react with frustration.</seg>
<seg id="2438">They wonder why I am not part of the movement.</seg>
<seg id="2439">They even lay well-thought out scientific and societal arguments in front of me why I should be feminist and why we should generally be all feminists * inside.</seg>
<seg id="2440">For example, women nowadays still earn less money than men, despite the same education.</seg>
<seg id="2441">That women are still under strict observation when it comes to what they are allowed to do with their body.</seg>
<seg id="2442">That violence against women is a global epidemic.</seg>
<seg id="2443">Or that cultural and social norms still ensure that women sooner or later encounter a glass ceiling in various spheres of life, and that discrimination on the basis of sex always moves across the many different countries and beliefs.</seg>
<seg id="2444">All of this is known to me and known.</seg>
<seg id="2445">I am convinced that I am double and triple below.</seg>
<seg id="2446">I am a black woman.</seg>
<seg id="2447">And yet: if I come to talk about skin color, on racism, on black women's women, black women in the LGBTIQ community or on black women from the Diaspora; if I mention how we have always been abused in physical, mental and verbal, both in and out of the feminist movement, many white female feminists decide to remain silent.</seg>
<seg id="2448">But they all agree that women - all women - should come together in order to "lift up their voices and" Kumbaya, my Lord "to achieve equality (some) of women.</seg>
<seg id="2449">But they don't want to talk about the fact that there is an institutionalized form of racist violence in addition to sexualised violence that we are faced with black women in two ways.</seg>
<seg id="2450">Or that black women and women of other ethnicities and places of origin deserve less than white men and women.</seg>
<seg id="2451">That black girls and girls with a migration background are often referred to school as white girls due to obvious integration problems.</seg>
<seg id="2452">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "or that women in black spheres and women with a migration background are exposed to a higher risk of suffering domestic violence and violence in the partnership than white women." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2453">On the one hand, I want all women, all men and all men of all skin color to have the same rights; on the other hand, I cannot join me as a black woman, in whose center the white woman stands who refuses to take into account injustice in her mind, which refer to both the gender and the skin colour of a person.</seg>
<seg id="2454">I am exhausted and will no longer fight for my affiliation in a white-feminist-oriented sphere, which always rejected me and countless other black women over and over again.</seg>
<seg id="2455">In 1851, Sojourner said in her speech, "Am I not a woman?" and I too refuse to maintain an ideology in which the black woman is a horrified and marginalized creature in a historic sense.</seg>
<seg id="2456">I refuse to join groups who also absorb our customs and customs through cultural appropriation to advance their egocentric programme.</seg>
<seg id="2457">I will no longer try to suggest white women the importance of overlapping skin color and gender. for some of them will continue to mention the importance of black women for the feminist movement, no matter how many black women try to teach them for the better.</seg>
<seg id="2458">Although the intersectional feminism was founded to give women of different origins a home and distinguish themselves from the white feminism, the word "feminism" still lies in its name.</seg>
<seg id="2459">I prefer to trigger myself fully and completely from feminism and to join the movement of Womanism, which was created for my dark skin and my status as a woman, rather than to use me for a white-feminist paradigm that is so persistent that intersectionality is celebrated as a novel phenomenon.</seg>
<seg id="2460">Now it is more important than ever before that we define black women according to our own ideas and set ourselves in the spheres that are created by us for us.</seg>
<seg id="2461">Clenora Hudson-Weems, author of the book Africana womanism: recall (about: Africa-Womanism: how we can defend ourselves) speaks of the fact that we can defend ourselves by defining our own way. and not only that - black women can also create spaces in which they can be completely safe and in which the cultural, spiritual, spiritual, physical and even the spiritual elements can be worshipped that make up the black woman.</seg>
<seg id="2462">Although some white and sectional feminists are immediately calling separatism and exclusion after reading these lines, I ask you to inform yourself about hypocrisy and the contradictions of the feminist movement, of which the black woman is concerned.</seg>
<seg id="2463">In a womanist environment I can lift black women and women of other cultures, for in this paradigm I exist.</seg>
<seg id="2464">I am recognized as a part of this paradigm because of my dark skin and my existence as a woman.</seg>

<seg id="2469">Nabil Musa has repeatedly travelled to Iraq over the past seven years - mostly with surfboard or in canoe - with a special concern from Kurdistan Region in Iraq. his mission aims to make people aware of the importance of clean waters for present and future generations.</seg>
<seg id="2470">In this documentary by Emily Kinskey we follow Musa, who explains his relationship with the region's rivers and the impact of pollution on his church.</seg>
<seg id="2471">"I absolutely wanted to do something for the river that we had lost when I was a child," Musa tells.</seg>
<seg id="2472">Scientists from all over the country fear that the decades of war, the construction of dams, pollution and uncontrolled development, will lead to a direct water crisis in Iraq.</seg>
<seg id="2473">Musa is a member of the Non-Governmental Organization Waterkeepers Iraq - a subsidiary of Waterkeeper Alliance - who is committed to protecting the rivers, streams and waterways in Iraq, as well as supporting local communities in the sustainable use of these natural resources. "</seg>
<seg id="2474">At the end of the video, Musa summarizes the urgency and importance of his work: "if we had no water, how would we survive?"</seg>
<seg id="2475">This video was produced, filmed and published for Ensia by Emily Kinskey, a documentary filmmaker and multimedia journalist based in Iraq.</seg>
<seg id="2476">The focus of her work lies on persecuted, little-acclaimed subcultures and is characterized by the use of co-operative videography and new multimedia techniques, with whose help suppressed congregations can tell their stories in their own way.</seg>

<seg id="2480">The following article is the abbreviated and edited version of the article "The Wave of Violence Against Women in Paraguay." the article belongs to the series # PorserMujer (# largeneinefraubin), which reports about the violence against women in Paraguay.</seg>
<seg id="2481">Most names have been changed to protect the persons affected.</seg>
<seg id="2482">A police commissar Ada Báez said that she could do nothing against Luis Balbuena, her ex-partner, who had become violent.</seg>
<seg id="2483">Since the end of their relationship some time had passed and the police said that their statement would be put to the files, but more could not be done.</seg>
<seg id="2484">When another woman showed Balbuena due to mistreatment, Ada Báez did not find anything useful.</seg>
<seg id="2485">A few days later, the second woman withdrew her ad.</seg>
<seg id="2486">Breaking the vicious circle of violence against women is difficult.</seg>
<seg id="2487">In general, if women complain at all, they generally do not receive support from the state.</seg>
<seg id="2488">In many cases, women are also financially dependent on men who abuse them. this also explains why only 20% of all women who admit to be victims of violence can even report to the law enforcement authorities.</seg>

<seg id="2490">It is difficult to determine how many women are really mistreated, says Myrian González, researcher for gender issues at the Centro de Documentación y Estudia, a social scientific research institution in Paraguay. "there are different indications and reports, but they do not even show the extent of gender violence against women in Paraguay."</seg>
<seg id="2491">The available numbers however are alarming.</seg>
<seg id="2492">In 2015, the District Attorney's Office filed 9600 advertisements for domestic violence. 70% of it was about violence against women.</seg>
<seg id="2493">86% of the ads in the police came from women.</seg>
<seg id="2494">There were over 5000 advertisements for domestic violence in the courts of peace. 86% of the ads of women came here too.</seg>
<seg id="2495">In the ads 40% of women reported that they were physically abused, 55% of women spoke of mental abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2496">These statistics, however, do not show the true extent of violence against women in Paraguay.</seg>
<seg id="2497">According to the Paraguayan women's minister, Ana Baiardi, only a few of these crimes are actually shown. "on any woman who returns to Paraguay for psychological ill treatment, 9 women who do not do so.</seg>
<seg id="2498">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "two women who do not do this because of physical abuse," "" "" "" "stated at the end of 2014." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2499">Since women's murder in Paraguay is not a private offence, prosecuting authorities cannot adequately document how many women are murdered by their current or former partners every year.</seg>
<seg id="2500">By August 2016 alone, journalists counted at least 12 cases of women's suicide in the country.</seg>
<seg id="2501">The coordinator of human rights in Paraguay documented at least 37 cases in which women were murdered by their current or former partners.</seg>
<seg id="2502">According to their estimates, every ten days a woman dies in Paraguay because of violence by men.</seg>

<seg id="2504">Invisible mistreatment and a judicial system that does nothing</seg>
<seg id="2505">Before Mariana Brítez became the firm girlfriend of Carlos Vera, he insisted that she called him the names of all her former friends.</seg>
<seg id="2506">At the beginning she didn't want to do that, but after that she had to repent.</seg>
<seg id="2507">Today Mariana is 28 years old and no longer together with Carlos. but for two years she endured psychological violence - one of the most common forms of violence against women and at the same time the most difficult recognizable:</seg>
<seg id="2508">I never thought I would be a victim of abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2509">When I read about it earlier, I always thought that it only happens to women who are too subservient because they are fooled by violent men.</seg>
<seg id="2510">I was convinced that this would never happen to me.</seg>
<seg id="2511">Mariana used social media to report on the abuse of Carlos Vera.</seg>
<seg id="2512">Without naming names, she wrote contributions on Facebook, in which she described his insults and various attacks during her two-year relationship and told how he had isolated her.</seg>
<seg id="2513">Many people responded to their contributions, including Carlos itself. he asked rhetorically whether he ever raised his hand against her and refused to admit that his behaviour was also a form of abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2514">Other Facebook users asked Mariana why she had fallen away from Carlos for so long and did not leave him before.</seg>
<seg id="2515">It seemed almost as if they wanted to say that victims of abuse had at least a certain complicity in it.</seg>
<seg id="2516">Victoria Santos, who did not come from Paraguay, fought for almost eight years with the authorities in Paraguay to prove that her former partner was mistreating her.</seg>
<seg id="2517">Victoria is a member of Yo te Creo network ("I think you") consisting of women who are all in some way victims of abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2518">In the group they can talk to others about their experiences, listen to each other and support each other.</seg>
<seg id="2519">They do what many others do not do: they take the statements of women seriously.</seg>
<seg id="2520">In Victorias case, everything began with psychological abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2521">Her wealthy partner finally managed to convince her that she was worthless.</seg>
<seg id="2522">Then he began beating them.</seg>
<seg id="2523">Victoria's ads with the authorities remained without a result and also from their relatives, they did not receive any support.</seg>
<seg id="2524">She led a trial against her former partner, who developed into an unmanageable legal battle between Paraguay and her home country, in which it was mainly about money, power and the influence of her former partner.</seg>

<seg id="2528">Carmen Echauri, a representative of the UN organisation for women in Paraguay, also faces great problems in applying laws in the country.</seg>
<seg id="2529">On August 10, 2016, a draft bill was discussed at the Paraguayan parliament which was announced under the hashtag # Porellas (# for you).</seg>
<seg id="2530">This hashtag and the # NiunaMenos movement (# Non-Extensions) are part of a Twitter campaign that is supported by Amnesty International.</seg>
<seg id="2531">The original draft of the law proposes that Femizid is to be declared a perpetual offense and punishable as it is already the case in the neighboring countries of Argentina and Bolivia.</seg>
<seg id="2532">Thus the bill was changed in a number of points in order to also win the deputies for the law, which feared that the way for decriminalisation of abortions was generally denied, which is currently banned in Paraguay and punishable by up to five years of imprisonment.</seg>
<seg id="2533">The original bill was intended to cost the majority of the (bureaucratic and economic) procedural costs that the victims of violence have to bear themselves, if they just want to reimburse them and receive a secure accommodation to impose the state.</seg>
<seg id="2534">Echauri argues that the law is not effective, if the legislature does not provide sufficient financial means for it:</seg>
<seg id="2535">In Paraguay, mistreatment is seen as a part of interpersonal relationships.</seg>
<seg id="2536">A change must take place here, so that violence is no longer seen as a normal thing.</seg>
<seg id="2537">Whoever is silent in the face of these facts makes himself guilty and contributes to the fact that the perpetrators are punished.</seg>
<seg id="2538">We have to reimburse for as long as mistreatment is no longer considered normal.</seg>
<seg id="2539">On 10 November 2016, the law passed in the Paraguayan Senate. however, parts of the law had been altered, among other things a passage that the partners called for reconciliation in cases of domestic violence.</seg>
<seg id="2540">Opinions on the changes are taking place.</seg>

<seg id="2546">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "this website was" "" "" "" "locked" "" "" "" "on the website of the banned paper Azamn." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2547">More than a year ago, the Turkish authorities closed the independent Arab-language newspaper Azamn because of its coverage of corruption in the sultan.</seg>
<seg id="2548">Yousef Al-Haj, one of the editors of the newspaper, continues to be in prison where he served an annual prison sentence.</seg>
<seg id="2549">Two other editors of Azamn, Ibrahim Al-Maamari and Zaher Al-Abri, were also arrested and tried in court, but later released.</seg>
<seg id="2550">Oman has been ruled by sultan Qabus ibn Said since 1970, who came to power after he had deposed his father, Said ibn Taimur, by a coup d "état.</seg>
<seg id="2551">Since then, alongside his role as the only sultan, he has held the most important offices in the country: Prime Minister, Minister of Defence, Supreme Commander of the Armed Forces, Finance Minister, Foreign Minister, Chairman of the Supreme Council for the Planning and President of the Central Bank.</seg>
<seg id="2552">The Sultan's rule is characterized by the insistence efforts of security forces, especially domestic secret services, public liberties, including freedom of the press, restricting freedom of press, independent journalists, bloggers and other activists, intimidating and detained.</seg>
<seg id="2553">The authorities systematically restrict peaceful and legitimate activities in human rights and hinder citizens, including activists, to freely express their views on public affairs of the country, such as corruption in authorities and institutions both online and offline.</seg>
<seg id="2554">The attack on the newspaper Azamn, her closure and the incarceration of three of her editors last year is a hard blow to press freedom in the country.</seg>
<seg id="2555">Azamn is an independent newspaper that has been reported since its inception in 2007 on corruption in Oman (an absolute monarchy) until it was banned by the authorities in August 2016.</seg>
<seg id="2556">On July 28, 2016, security forces Ibrahim Al-Maamari, editor-in-chief of Azamn, announced that an article entitled "High-level Parties to the Justice" was published in the paper on July 26, 2016.</seg>
<seg id="2557">In the report, government officials were accused of having put pressure on judges of the Supreme Court in Oman to make a decision in a case of inheritance.</seg>

<seg id="2560">On 3 August 2016, Zaher Al-Abri, Member of the Board of Directors, was invited to the special department by ISS and arrested on his arrival by the security forces.</seg>
<seg id="2561">On 9 August 2016, ISS received the Deputy Editor-in-Chief Yousef Al-Haj, who had acted as editor-in-chief at Al-Maxi's arrest.</seg>
<seg id="2562">The newspaper was closed indefinitely after the Minister of Information had given the order that "the publication and distribution of the paper was prohibited by any means, including online, from 9 August 2016."</seg>
<seg id="2563">On 26 September 2016, before the Court of Maskat, the first trial took place in the trial against Al-Maamari, Al-Haj and Al-Abri.</seg>
<seg id="2564">The Court sentenced the three journalists to prison terms and ordered the final closing of the newspaper.</seg>

<seg id="2566">In addition, al-Haj was found guilty of violating a ban on publication and slandering.</seg>
<seg id="2567">Al-Maamari and Al-Haj were sentenced to three years of imprisonment and fines in the amount of 3000 omanic rial (7800 US dollars).</seg>
<seg id="2568">Al-Abri was sentenced to a year prison and a fine of 1000 Rial (2600 US dollars) after he was found guilty of using an information network to disseminate material that could pose a threat to public order.</seg>
<seg id="2569">For al-Abri, a security deposit of $5000 was fixed ($13,000) and was released from prison on 22 August 2016.</seg>
<seg id="2570">The Court of Appeal told Al-Abri in a hearing on 26 December 2016, but Al-Haj sentenced him to six months in prison for a year and Al-Maamari.</seg>
<seg id="2571">Al-Maamari was released on 10 April 2017 after his six-month prison sentence from the central prison in Maskat. al-Haj is still in prison where he served his annual prison sentence.</seg>
<seg id="2572">The Appeals Court also highlighted the decision of the Ministry of Information to close the "Azamn" newspaper.</seg>
<seg id="2573">Despite the decision of the Court to relinquish Azamn, the newspaper still faces attacks by the Turkish government.</seg>
<seg id="2574">On 8 January, the Minister of Information issued an order to extend the closing of "Azamn" for three months.</seg>
<seg id="2575">On 8 May 2017, the Minister of Information personally signed another order in which the closing of "Azamn" was extended by three additional months, and with which the minister once again decided against the decision of the Court of Appeal to re-publish the publication of the newspaper.</seg>
<seg id="2576">The ongoing closure of Azamn and the attacks on journalists from the newspaper aren't the only cases in which the press freedom in Oman has been injured in recent times.</seg>
<seg id="2577">Further injuries include closing the website of the independent magazine Mowatin and exercising pressure on Albalad, the first independent online newspaper of the country to halt its operation.</seg>
<seg id="2578">Due to the ongoing closure of Azamn and the arrest of the journalist Al-Haj, the impression is that the omanic authorities are still unwilling to put an end to the extensive violation of the freedom of the press.</seg>
<seg id="2579">The Gulf Centre for Human Rights (Gulf Centre for Human Rights, GCHR) calls on the Austrian authorities to:</seg>
<seg id="2580">1. release Yousef Al-Haj immediately and unconditionally;</seg>
<seg id="2581">2. to create a secure environment for the newspaper Azamn, so that their journalists can pursue their work;</seg>
<seg id="2582">3. to protect the freedom of the press in the country and</seg>
<seg id="2583">4. to ensure that human rights defenders and journalists in Oman can exercise their legitimate human rights work unhindered and without fear of retaliation, including judicial chicanes.</seg>

<seg id="2587">Ranjit Warrier 2016 in Zambia, picture taken with his consent</seg>
<seg id="2588">Medical research in Africa is rarely mentioned or even mentioned in the media. this is a growing area addressing one of the most urgent needs of the continent.</seg>
<seg id="2589">There are two reasons for the need for medical research carried out on-site: on the one hand, many medicines and vaccines that cover the special medical need on the African continent are missing in the offer of the global healthcare industry.</seg>
<seg id="2590">Diseases such as AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria have far more grave consequences in the poorest countries of Africa than elsewhere, and lack of investment in the research of these diseases by the pharmaceutical companies is a major problem.</seg>
<seg id="2591">Second, research carried out by African scientists is helping establish their own research capacities in Africa. a major role of science and technology can only be conducive to the economic growth of the continent.</seg>
<seg id="2592">Dr. Ranjit Warrier is Director of the Centre for Infectious Disease in Zambia (Centre for Infectious Disease Research in Zambia, CIDRZ).</seg>
<seg id="2593">He grew up in Lusaka, Zambia in the 1990s, when the AIDS epidemic showed first serious effects on national health.</seg>
<seg id="2594">He left Zambia for studying in the United States, initially in Louisiana, later in Indiana.</seg>
<seg id="2595">As a postdoc at the University of Pennsylvania he asked himself the HIV virus before he decided to go back home in order to support the Sambic health system.</seg>
<seg id="2596">With Global Voices, Dr. Warrier discussed the future of medical research in Zambia and about misunderstandings of the media about this research.</seg>
<seg id="2597">(disclaimer: Dr. Warrier speaks as a private person).</seg>
<seg id="2598">Global Voices (GM): what is your research topic?</seg>
<seg id="2599">Ranjit Warrier RW: at the moment, the focus of my work lies on the application of research results. I support the sambian national program for antiretroviral therapy (ART) with laboratory tests.</seg>
<seg id="2600">I am also a research program for the development of molecular diagnostic tests for HIV, TB and other relevant pathogens.</seg>
<seg id="2601">GM: what do you think are the important current scientific topics in your country and in general in Africa?</seg>
<seg id="2602">How do they differ from those in Western countries?</seg>
<seg id="2603">RW: there is no basic research here. we only implement solutions that have been developed elsewhere.</seg>
<seg id="2604">This has to change, otherwise we will always remain recipient instead of being a creator.</seg>
<seg id="2605">The solutions we get are often not very suitable in our environment, and sometimes it is even impossible to use them here.</seg>
<seg id="2606">GM: where does funding and support come from?</seg>
<seg id="2607">Is it sufficient?</seg>
<seg id="2608">How easy or difficult is it to find suitable scientists for the projects?</seg>
<seg id="2609">RW: from the USA and Europe.</seg>
<seg id="2610">The projects are well funded.</seg>
<seg id="2611">It is difficult to find people who want to come back or move here because funding and development opportunities are better in other countries.</seg>
<seg id="2612">GM: what is the research infrastructure?</seg>
<seg id="2613">Which obstacles are there in your routine research work you did not before?</seg>
<seg id="2614">RW: the basic infrastructure does not meet the standards in developed countries. it costs a lot of money, a continuous supply of electricity, water and internet.</seg>
<seg id="2615">Laboratory material is expensive, and it takes months to import it from other countries.</seg>
<seg id="2616">GM: what is the opinion of the public about science and scientists in Africa?</seg>
<seg id="2617">RW: there is an interest, but only a very limited understanding of scientific methods.</seg>
<seg id="2618">I would suggest that critical thinking and scientific methods should be taught in schools to improve the situation.</seg>
<seg id="2619">GM: how big is your opinion about the potential of scientific research in Africa, what should they focus on, and how can we support the development?</seg>
<seg id="2620">RW: the potential is amazing.</seg>
<seg id="2621">I have seen great students of all ages.</seg>
<seg id="2622">There is need for special academic training, starting at any age.</seg>
<seg id="2623">The social sciences, computer science, big data, exploration of space, healthcare (non-transferable and infectious diseases) and the efficiency of traditional medicine will benefit greatly from this.</seg>
<seg id="2624">GM: can you describe the pros and cons of life as a scientist in Africa vs. Western countries based on your experience?</seg>
<seg id="2625">RW: often it is the limited speed to do things, and the difficult access to scientific expertise that poses challenges here.</seg>
<seg id="2626">The system that periodicals make articles accessible only against payment (the so-called Paywall) limits the amount of information available and the speed of research.</seg>
<seg id="2627">From the USA to India: how "Open Source" seed producers change global food production</seg>
<seg id="2628">This article by Rachel Cernansky was originally published on Ensia.com website, a magazine about solutions for environmental problems worldwide.</seg>
<seg id="2629">Frank Morton has been breeding a salad in the USA since the 1980s.</seg>
<seg id="2630">Its company offers 114 varieties such as Outreddish, the first plant that has been grown and consumed by NASA astronauts in space.</seg>
<seg id="2631">For almost 20 years, Morton's work was limited only by his own imagination and the question how many types of salads he can get.</seg>
<seg id="2632">But at the beginning of the 2000s, he realized that more and more salads were patented and that he could not use them further for breeding.</seg>
<seg id="2633">The patents are not only for individual varieties, but also for certain properties, such as resistance to diseases, a special red or green tone or curled leaves.</seg>
<seg id="2634">In recent years, more and more such patents have been registered to more and more plants such as cereal or cardboard. due to these trends, plant breeders, environmentalists and experts for food security are concerned about the future of food production.</seg>
<seg id="2635">As a passionate representative of a millennia-old tradition, Morton still breeds lettuce, but now it takes longer, because his work becomes more and more difficult due to more and more restrictions.</seg>
<seg id="2636">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "it is as if there is a boulder in a river that I have to bring in." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2637">So we have to do it now, but it's a break with the breeding tradition, "he says." I think these patents go too far on salads.</seg>
<seg id="2638">And if they stand in court, no one can breed a new type of salad, because all the features are already patented. "</seg>
<seg id="2639">However, he is very careful and endeavours not to use any material that is protected as intellectual property.</seg>
<seg id="2640">He also joined a movement growing in the U.S. and all over the world: open Source Breeding ("Open Source" breeding).</seg>
<seg id="2641">Astronauts of the International Space Station ISS have bred red reddish salat of the Outreddish variety in the "greenhouse" of the station and eaten. there, it is tested whether plants can be grown in space.</seg>
<seg id="2642">Photo: NASA</seg>
<seg id="2643">It is no coincidence that this name sounds like the movement from the IT area and not from the field of plant breeding.</seg>
<seg id="2644">The Open Source Seed Initiative (initiative for open source seeds) is inspired by the movement for free open source software that provides alternatives to copyrighted software.</seg>
<seg id="2645">It has been launched to ensure that some plant species and genes are not protected as intellectual property and thus can be used permanently for plant breeders.</seg>
<seg id="2646">As part of the initiative, called Ossi, US breeders can commit themselves to the fact that others can use the seeds bred by them freely.</seg>
<seg id="2647">However, this does not mean that they cannot continue to do business with their seeds and sell it. "open source" breeders only allow others who buy their seeds to breed their own varieties and do not immediately sow - two aspects that are banned or prescribed by many plant patents.</seg>
<seg id="2648">Dozens of breeders and seed companies have already joined the initiative since their launch in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2649">Gloomy prospects</seg>
<seg id="2650">For the Emeritus Professor at the University of Wisconsin-Madison and Ossi board member Jack Kloppenburg, control of the seeds and the possibility of breeding new plants are important for food security and environmental protection.</seg>
<seg id="2651">Seeds play a role in larger contexts such as biodiversity, farmers' rights, control over the food system and use of chemicals in agriculture. independent breeders would try to use the latter not or only little by breeding seeds with natural resistance.</seg>
<seg id="2652">Kloppenburg stresses that the "open-source" movement does not deal with genetically modified plants.</seg>
<seg id="2653">All kinds of plants could be patented, whether vegetables, corn, genetically modified or not, from ecological agriculture or not. "in order to achieve our goal of ecological sustainability, we need control over seed, whose recent examples are the merges of ChemChina and Syngenta and Monsanto and Bayer, which are offered in farmers markets for example, should also know that the way this vegetables is bred is threatened.</seg>
<seg id="2654">"" "" "" "food sovereignty without seed sovereignty is not possible." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2655">The members of the Open Source Seed Initiative are committed to ensuring that their seeds remain freely available to others. in contrast, their approach is to patent seed and plant characteristics.</seg>
<seg id="2656">Photo of Jack Kloppenburg.</seg>
<seg id="2657">Ossi supporters argue that the future of food supply is at risk, as the available gene pool is constantly shrinking due to the increasingly numerous intellectual property rights on plant material that is thus always available.</seg>
<seg id="2658">Claire Luby, executive director of Ossi, has engaged in her doctoral thesis with genetic variation in carrots and their availability. she found out that about a third of all carrot characteristics are protected as intellectual property, making it difficult for plant breeders either not at all or difficult to use.</seg>
<seg id="2659">For other plants, there are no such estimates, but experts like Luby suggest that mass grown plants such as wheat are patented in even greater style than lettuce or carrots.</seg>
<seg id="2660">A question of view</seg>
<seg id="2661">Plants are bred in such a way that they exhibit specifically desired traits - from those through which their taste or colour improves to those, due to which they prosper in certain environments and maintain threats such as pests or diseases.</seg>
<seg id="2662">Opponents of patents on plant properties point out that the available plant material for breeders is decreasing due to more and more patents. however, genetic diversity is more necessary than ever since changing conditions are much worse due to climate change.</seg>
<seg id="2663">In an e-mail Monsanto-Speaker Carly Scaduto recognises that genetic diversity is generally important and also crucial for Monsanto's activities. with a total of four gene banks and cooperation with institutions such as the United States Ministry of Agriculture, the company is committed to maintaining genetic diversity.</seg>
<seg id="2664">It contradicts, however, that intellectual property may restrict other breeders, as "patents and the protection of plant varietal innovations promote innovation." "a patent is basically a plan that everyone can follow as soon as the patent has expired.</seg>
<seg id="2665">Often these instructions help others to get the same result with another method.</seg>
<seg id="2666">Such protection thus does not inhibit innovation, but promotes it by providing more material and know-how to the public. "</seg>
<seg id="2667">Morton sees this differently: 20 years wait for a patent to run, certainly not promoting innovation.</seg>
<seg id="2668">And if you have to wait so long to grow in plants adapted to changing environmental conditions, you have already lost the fight.</seg>
<seg id="2669">But the main argument for Morton is that genetic resources have always been a general good and should continue to remain: "independent plant breeders have neither time nor money for such formalities, and monetary incentives are not attractive to us.</seg>
<seg id="2670">We want to make farmers work easier.</seg>
<seg id="2671">"" "" "" "this is what drives us and it is impossible for us to continue to use the best and newest genetic resources." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2672">In total, Morton interferes with the concept of patenting plant features: "we don't really create the characteristics themselves.</seg>
<seg id="2673">The plants form them themselves and as breeders we finally have no idea how the plants do that.</seg>
<seg id="2674">A mystery of nature. "</seg>
<seg id="2675">For Carol Deppe, plant breeder in the US state Oregon and Ossi board member, there is another important aspect of plant breeding: "who breeds a variety, also breeds its own values into it.</seg>
<seg id="2676">Those who believe in industrial agriculture with large farms and monocultures, for whose cultivation it is necessary to produce mass herbicides, breeds in its varieties this concept of agriculture.</seg>
<seg id="2677">My concept is exactly opposite. "</seg>
<seg id="2678">While some medium-sized companies (such, which move on international markets, but smaller than for example Monsanto), they create most of the smaller seed companies to survive even without patents - either they reject the patent or they hold it for too expensive and therefore not profitable or both is the case.</seg>
<seg id="2679">The independent plant breeder Frank Morton looks for Salate in his breeding garden.</seg>
<seg id="2680">Photo by Karen Morton.</seg>
<seg id="2681">Morton is also the opinion that breeders would be more innovative by avoiding plant patents: "it looks like I am stronger with my efforts to produce something new, stronger than a company that patented.</seg>
<seg id="2682">I constantly need new material for my catalogue, since I know that my competitors will sell my grades in a few years, "he says." with a patent, one is protected from competition for 20 years, which makes it really easy for me to do. "worldwide response</seg>
<seg id="2683">While the US seems to be the leader in Open Source breeding, the concept is spreading rapidly around the world.</seg>
<seg id="2684">In India, the Centre for Sustainable Agriculture ("Centre for Sustainable Agriculture"), which describes itself as a professional organization in the field of resources, works together with farmers and helps them to breed new varieties that meet specific requirements.</seg>
<seg id="2685">It also supports them to come to open source seeds and sell their own.</seg>
<seg id="2686">The German Organization Agrecol is working on an open-source license which is ultimately a formal and legally binding form of Ossi-Commitment for breeders in the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2687">(regulations for breeding distinguish themselves from country to country, so the Ossi obligation cannot be easily taken over one in Europe or other parts of the world.)</seg>
<seg id="2688">At the beginning of November 2016, the Executive of the European Union, the European Commission, declared that conventionally bred plants should not be patentable. thus, it speaks against the current practice of the European Patent Office, which permits patents on conventionally bred plants.</seg>
<seg id="2689">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "however, an explanation is not a law; now it is up to the governments of the Member States to bring the patent office to implement this new line." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2690">In October 2016, the Dutch organisation Hivos organized a conference on "Open Source" seed systems in Ethiopia, on the farmers, operators of seed banks and representatives of governments, non-governmental organizations, and seed companies from all East Africa to learn about the "Open Source" seed movement and the worldwide trend to patents seeds.</seg>
<seg id="2691">Willy Douma, responsible for Hivos's program for open source seed systems, explains that the organization is currently building a global alliance for open source seed systems, which will be the official start of the official launch next year.</seg>
<seg id="2692">A merger of environmental protection and development aid groups (including Hivos, the international non-profit development aid organisation USC Canada and the action group on erosion, technology and concentration) have put together a database on seed and biodiversity in the world to publish the Seed Map Project, a seed map.</seg>
<seg id="2693">In September, the Global Alliance for the Future of Food, the global alliance for the future of food, has published a report on aid organisations such as the WK Kellogg Foundation, the McKnight Foundation and others. it believes farmers must have the opportunity to come to seed, exchange and improve seed policy, so that a stable supply of food can be ensured.</seg>

<seg id="2720">Human rights organisation and blog are the newest aims of censorship in Egypt</seg>
<seg id="2721">The Egyptian authorities still lock content on the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="2722">This time it met the website of a human rights organisation and the blog of a columnist.</seg>
<seg id="2723">On the weekend of 5 August the Egyptian government blocked the website of the Arabic Network for Human Rights Information (ANHRI), which documents human rights violations in Egypt and the Arab world and reports about it.</seg>
<seg id="2724">In August, the network published an opinion on Facebook, in which it sharply criticized the Egyptian authorities for this step and promised to continue the work and efforts for human rights in the region.</seg>
<seg id="2725">The Arabic Network for Human Rights Information abides in spite of this attack and the ridicule of the Egyptian law and the constitution by the authorities who are actually defending the law to pursue the freedom of expression and human rights in the Arab world. even though it has never been so difficult to pursue these goals, it has never been as important as now.</seg>
<seg id="2726">ANHRI is considered the first censored website of a human rights organization in Egypt after the authorities blocked 21 websites more than two months ago, such as the independent news page Mada Masr, Arab-language edition of the Huffington Post and the Qatar-based network of Al Jazeera for alleged "support from terrorism."</seg>
<seg id="2727"># Egypt: 1. human rights organisation of wave of wave crossings has fallen victim. @ anhri one of the main data sources for human rights in Arabic language https: / / t.co / NIZmOpDS5K</seg>
<seg id="2728">In addition to ANHRI, the blog of columnist and human rights researcher, Ahmed Gamal Ziada, has no access to Egypt anymore.</seg>
<seg id="2729">Ziada took advantage of his blog for the dissemination of columns and articles, which he writes for non-accessible websites and media for Egypt.</seg>
<seg id="2730">Now the blog, which he set up to bypass the censorship of the Egyptian government, became the target of an attack.</seg>
<seg id="2731">Blogger, the provider who is also home to Ziadas's blog, is still accessible.</seg>
<seg id="2732">Ziada, a former photojournalist, spent nearly 500 days in prison after being arrested by Egyptian security forces in December 2013, while he reported on the student protests and recorded a video on how police exercised physical violence against two students.</seg>
<seg id="2733">His articles revolve mainly around politics and the human rights situation in Egypt.</seg>
<seg id="2734">In a Facebook comment, Ziada spoke to the government by the government and reflected what this meant for him:</seg>
<seg id="2735">The blogs to lock is very old, but has priority in the era of Abdelfattah al-Sisi; and even if the blogging of the blogs may not be significant for the world, it is for me for two reasons:</seg>
<seg id="2736">1) It has been able to convey to me the feeling of a state of siege; An attempted murder, attempted murder, summons at the National Security Council, the blockage blogs as well as any other website I worked for.</seg>
<seg id="2737">2) They have proven that I did not write in vain. in other words: my words have influence, albeit only to a small audience.</seg>
<seg id="2738">I would like to mention that this blog was an archive for me.</seg>
<seg id="2739">First, I used it to post articles to circumvent censorship.</seg>
<seg id="2740">But now after they have locked him and that they are afraid of words, I can still change the link or create a second blog.</seg>
<seg id="2741">The courageous go the way to the end.</seg>
<seg id="2742">According to the Association for Freedom of Thought and Expression (afte) Egyptian authorities blocked 133 web pages from May 24 to June 06. this resulted in technical tests on networks of different Internet Service Providers (ISP), including orange, Vodafone and ETISALAT.</seg>
<seg id="2743">In addition, afte documented the blockage of providers through the circumvention of internet censorship and private surfing, so-called Virtual Private Networks (VPNs)</seg>
<seg id="2744">Afte reported in her research:</seg>
<seg id="2745">On Monday, June 12 we noticed how the blocking of web pages that VPNs offer began.</seg>
<seg id="2746">Such practice suggests the government's intention to continue to block and filter content that the Egyptian users could have access.</seg>
<seg id="2747">The situation is further worsened by the fact that the censorship decisions are taken behind closed doors, so that the Egyptian population has no legal basis with which to proceed in court against these acts.</seg>
<seg id="2748">Now the question arises: how far is the Egyptian government ready to go with censorship and who will attack it next?</seg>
<seg id="2749">Is Rio de Janeiro in war?</seg>
<seg id="2750">The inhabitants fight.</seg>

<seg id="2753">Day after day newspapers report in Brazil with gloomy headlines from Rio de Janeiro, the second largest city in the country and home of numerous postcard motifs.</seg>
<seg id="2754">Some of these headlines are as follows:</seg>
<seg id="2755">"14-year-old shot in school," "Every second day, a police officer in Rio de Janeiro is murdered," "Thieves robbed pharmacy with military weapons," "President Temer sends 8500 soldiers of the army, navy and air afee to Rio."</seg>
<seg id="2756">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "in the midst of the economic crisis and in a tense financial situation, the threshold of violence in 2017 in Rio reached the highest level for 10 years." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2757">The Brazilian non-governmental organisation Global Justice even called on the United Nations to intervene.</seg>
<seg id="2758">Reports like these have become commonplace and this is unacceptable & # 8212; at least find the managers of a local newspaper.</seg>
<seg id="2759">In this way, the newspaper "Extra" published in Rio for detailed reporting on violence in Rio published the editorial "That is not normal," in which she announced to set up a new column called "War in Rio."</seg>
<seg id="2760">All reports on violence in the city are now published there.</seg>
<seg id="2761">The paper explained the motives for their decision:</seg>
<seg id="2762">Extra will continue to report on crimes that happen in every big city in the world such as murder, robbery, sexual crimes, etc. everything, however, deviates from the civilized standard and what happens only in Rio will be published in the "War in Rio." (...) This is our way to call: this is not normal!</seg>
<seg id="2763">This is the only alternative, so that as journalists we do not close our eyes to cruelty.</seg>
<seg id="2764">In a four minute video shared on Facebook, Octávio Guedes, editor-in-chief of the newspaper, declared that this decision was not an occasion for pride but rather a sign of failure:</seg>
<seg id="2765">Extra is probably the only newspaper all over the world with a war break in a country that does not recognize the war at all.</seg>
<seg id="2766">In the same video, a journalist of the newspaper explains that, according to the Institute for Internal Security, there are 843 domains controlled by criminal organizations.</seg>
<seg id="2767">The newspaper further writes in the editorial:</seg>
<seg id="2768">We are aware that a war discourse when it is distorted can also be used to disguise the atrocities of the police who are only shooting and then asking questions.</seg>
<seg id="2769">But we defend the war based on information and the fight against corruption in the police whose aim is not the civilian population, but the economic power of the mafia and its partners.</seg>
<seg id="2770">Does the term "war" harm more than it uses?</seg>
<seg id="2771">In an article on the news portal The Intercept Brasil, journalist Cecília Oliveira is arguing that violence is a "war." this is, in its opinion, a justification of the failed security policy through the media and could make it more difficult to take accountability in the police.</seg>
<seg id="2772">This is not a war.</seg>
<seg id="2773">This is the result of corruption and poor planning - as demonstrated in the analysis of military operations in Rio itself - in combination with insufficient investment in personnel, education and a historical and complacent neglect of public service.</seg>
<seg id="2774">As a reminder: the state of Rio de Janeiro is bigger than its capital.</seg>

<seg id="2780">Extra belongs to Globo, the largest media company in South America, which, as Cecília stresses, has been repeating the state's security policy for years.</seg>
<seg id="2781">The establishment of the UPP (Unidade de Polícia Pacificadora), a police unit established by the Federal State of Rio in 2003, was also part of these security policy measures.</seg>
<seg id="2782">In the beginning, this actually led to a decrease of violent death cases. for some years, however, the UPP was increasingly under fire after several reports of harassment and repression against the poor communities that were supposed to protect the newly created police unit.</seg>
<seg id="2783">On his Facebook page, the journalist João Paulo Charleaux quoted from one of his articles in 2010, in which he explains why the violence in Rio is not consistent with the criteria set out by the Geneva Convention - the designation "Civil War."</seg>
<seg id="2784">He writes:</seg>
<seg id="2785">In addition to legal issues, the classification of the situation in Rio as a war also involves serious consequences for the people.</seg>
<seg id="2786">For this requires the state to use resources and means typical of war. this includes penetration into the territory of a "enemy," where a civilian is an unsharp point in the landscape and becomes an object for "collateral damage" and "lost balls."</seg>
<seg id="2787">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "war back or forth," "" "" "" "the fact is that the inhabitants of the Favelas continue to suffer in Rio." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="2802">Since the beginning of the Syrian revolution in 2011 and in the subsequent civil war, many Syrian cities suffer from brutal siege and blockades, mainly through the Assad regime towards loyal troops.</seg>
<seg id="2803">According to Siege Watch, a joint initiative of the Peace Organisation (PAX) and the research institute The Syria Institute, there are currently around one million Syrians in a state of siege in Damascus and surrounding, Homs, Deir Ezzor and Idlib.</seg>
<seg id="2804">The region of East Ghouta was particularly severely affected, where an attack with chemical weapons on August 21, 2013 called for the lives of hundreds of civilians.</seg>
<seg id="2805">Many governments, international organizations, and the Syrian opposition, based on investigations by the United Nations and other human rights organisations, have been committed to the massacre of the Assad regime.</seg>
<seg id="2806">Since 2013, these rebel-controlled areas outside Damascus have stood under siege, which led to inhabitants of locally produced or through tunnels and control points dependent on food-grained food.</seg>
<seg id="2807">Through the years of blockage, traditional foods such as meat have become unachievable for large parts of the population.</seg>
<seg id="2808">As a countermeasure, a group of Syrian humanitarian helpers and academics teach the inhabitants of East Ghoutas how they can plant their own mushrooms as a "food-saving food source."</seg>
<seg id="2809">They call themselves Ghiras Alnahda and carry out the project together with the NGO Al Adala.</seg>
<seg id="2810">Mushrooms do not belong to the traditional crops planted in Syria and are rarely part of the Syrian cuisine. however, their food quality makes them an attractive source of food for many residents of the besieged East Ghouta.</seg>

<seg id="2813">Dr. Ahmed Leila, one of the organizers, reports Global Voices that for three years has been struggling to make this project known and expressed his relief that it is now gaining more and more awareness. "</seg>
<seg id="2814">To collect money for the initiative, we use the humanitarian crowd funding platform Cando in consultation with the NGO Ghiras Alnahda.</seg>
<seg id="2815">It is planned to give 125 families a knowledge of planting mushrooms, so Dr. Leila became Global Voices.</seg>
<seg id="2816">At the time of the Constitution of this article, they have reached over 100% of their expected target of around 12,700 €, but will continue to raise funds to Cando until Monday, 04 September 2017.</seg>
<seg id="2817">The initiative depends on generators that keep the temperature stable at 25 ° C and humidity at 80%.</seg>
<seg id="2818">Because of the fuel shortage, locally produced plastic fuels are used to supply generators with the necessary energy.</seg>
<seg id="2819">Dr. Leila said Global Voices that they started the production of mushroom seeds from the regions before checking their quality and whether they are suitable for consumption.</seg>
<seg id="2820">Then they planted a small mushroom backyard in a tub. as this succeeded, they used a larger tub. and so on.</seg>
<seg id="2821">Now they have designed a "educational farm for the region."</seg>

<seg id="2833">Several hundred people protested in many district capital cities in Portugal on 21 October and demanded justice for the victims of fires raging in the north of Portugal in the week before.</seg>
<seg id="2834">Forty-two people died and about 70 were injured as a result of the forest fires of 15 and 16 October. this led to the government spending the last week out of solidarity with the victims for 3 days.</seg>
<seg id="2835">Fires were also registered in the Galicia region in Spain, where there were 4 dead.</seg>
<seg id="2836">It is estimated that there were more than 500 fire outbreaks that spread in the northern and central regions of the country and reached about 250 million hectares of forest and numerous villages.</seg>
<seg id="2837">In June, a similar tragedy occured in Pedrógão Grande, where there were 64 deaths and more than 200 injured.</seg>
<seg id="2838">According to the European forestry surveillance system, which monitors the forest areas via satellite images, approximately 500,000 hectares of forest are burnt in Portugal alone in 2017 - an area of the size of the Lisbon district.</seg>
<seg id="2839">So that you can get a better picture of the seriousness of the situation: there is no fire in 4 districts.</seg>

<seg id="2844">The foreseeable tragedy</seg>
<seg id="2845">The target of the protests of Saturday was the demand for better preventive and fire fighting measures by the state.</seg>
<seg id="2846">People wondered why civil protection was not able to contain the extent of the tragedy as far as possible.</seg>
<seg id="2847">João Soveral from the federal government of Portugal declared the newspaper Público:</seg>
<seg id="2848">After Pedrógão, roads and villages were evacuated for anything and nothing.</seg>
<seg id="2849">This Sunday they did not do this anywhere: there are dozens of open roads surrounded by fire.</seg>
<seg id="2850">In the woods of Leiria, a similar tragedy could have happened in June, as the streets were closed very late. "</seg>
<seg id="2851">In addition, building permits are questioned in locations with a high risk of fire.</seg>
<seg id="2852">A far-reaching proposal on the reform of the forest, which the government had brought in after serious fires in the years 2003 and 2005, was objected to by the local authorities, who saw the new rules as an obstacle to investment.</seg>
<seg id="2853">"the government introduced an easing of the law which allowed the construction activity to fall, if the applicant had a means of self-protection - that was an open rear door, so that everything could be built," continues João Sorval in the same article of the newspaper Público.</seg>
<seg id="2854">The environment organisation Quercus pointed out that large areas with eucalyptus, trees made of light-flammable wood spread out, as in a vicious circle, after fires of this kind.</seg>
<seg id="2855">In addition to these problems, the website of the Civil Defence of Portugal on October 15 and 16, when citizens were looking for information or attempted to contact their relatives, was offline.</seg>
<seg id="2856">It was a private initiative that provided the people with information: it used fogos.pt's own civil protection data and informed the population in real time about the location and spread of fires.</seg>
<seg id="2857">The project was launched in 2015 by the developer João Pina to simplify the work of the fire brigade, and this fateful weekend in October was so crucial that the servers did not stand up to the onslaught of the 400,000 users who followed the fires: the website numbered more than half a million people.</seg>

<seg id="2877">At dawn, the boy should break.</seg>
<seg id="2878">His uncle would pick him up and bring him to the tugs.</seg>

<seg id="2884">Abdul Ali Mazari, leader of the Hezb-e-Wahdat, dominated by Hazara, had just been murdered by the Taliban and many Hazara felt unprotected.</seg>
<seg id="2885">The Taliban, known for their hatred for the Hazara, always came closer.</seg>
<seg id="2886">Many Hazara left the country in the direction of Pakistan or Iran.</seg>
<seg id="2887">A few days after his escape, Asharaf found himself in Pakistan.</seg>
<seg id="2888">For a few years he worked in a coal mine. the work was hard and made him ill.</seg>
<seg id="2889">Then he took what was left of his little wage, and went to Iran. once again he was in a foreign country along with other refugees and dragged sacks with mortar, which were heavier than himself, in order to earn his livelihood.</seg>
<seg id="2890">At that time, as today, the lives of Afghan refugees in Iran were marked by misery and exploitation.</seg>
<seg id="2891">"it was really hard," Asharaf remembered in an interview with Global Voices. "we (Afghan refugees) lived in an empty building on the construction site on which we also worked.</seg>
<seg id="2892">There were no services there and no heating. we hung nylon in front of the open windows, so that we could not freeze at night. "</seg>
<seg id="2893">After four years Asharaf has left his life without documents in Iran and made himself ready for the journey to Europe.</seg>
<seg id="2894">During the dangerous crossing of the sea he suffered shipwreck and stranded on a small, uninhabited island.</seg>
<seg id="2895">After the Greek authorities rejected his asylum application, Asharaf came to Italy in 2002.</seg>
<seg id="2896">Some time Asharaf was homeless, ran alone through the streets of Rome, slept in parks and went to a church that distributed food to needy people twice a day.</seg>
<seg id="2897">While it is true that Italy is a kind of second chance for rejected asylum seekers due to relatively high response rates, it is also true that the conditions that asylum seekers find in the country are catastrophic.</seg>
<seg id="2898">The human rights organisation Civil Liberties Union for Europe writes that the system suffers from a general lack of transparency.</seg>
<seg id="2899">The large majority of asylum seekers are accommodated in the more than 3000 "special reception centres." these are improvised facilities in the hands of unqualified and unprepared personnel. "</seg>
<seg id="2900">According to the Italian Law, asylum seekers can only be assigned to a reception centre if they have officially submitted an application for asylum - which can go for months after registering the asylum request.</seg>
<seg id="2901">Until then, people who have no money for accommodation can either depend on the hospitality of friends or have to sleep on the street.</seg>
<seg id="2902">So it was also Asharaf.</seg>
<seg id="2903">But his boundless way of life helped Asharaf to get rid of these conditions soon.</seg>
<seg id="2904">After having worked for several years in the construction industry, Asharaf tasted his entire savings into the establishment of a hostels in Venice.</seg>
<seg id="2905">This was so good that after a while he opened a second hostel and a fast food bar.</seg>
<seg id="2906">Asharaf Baratis's success story is now subject of the documentary "Behind Venice Luxury - a Hazara in Italy" (German: "behind Venetian Luxury - a Hazara in Italy") of the director Amin Wahidi.</seg>
<seg id="2907">The film was awarded the Venice City Award for the 24th time in 2017.</seg>

<seg id="2911">The conditions for entrepreneurs in Italy - especially for non-Italians - are very difficult.</seg>
<seg id="2912">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "a lot of bureaucracy, high taxes and conditions for loans are just some of the obstacles." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2913">According to inofficial estimates, about 20,000 Afghans live in Italy.</seg>
<seg id="2914">For many of them, the country is a transitional solution on the way to other European countries.</seg>
<seg id="2915">In recent years, some Afghans have emerged, including tailors, travel agencies, hotels and restaurants.</seg>
<seg id="2916">Some Afghan restaurants were even praised in the Italian press for their excellent cuisine.</seg>
<seg id="2917">In Venice Hamed Ahmadi had the idea of his restaurant Orient Experience where the waiters and the kitchen staff were mostly refugees from different parts of the world.</seg>
<seg id="2918">The menu of the restaurant tells the story of their trip to Italy by the different Afghan, Iraqi, Turkish and Greek courts.</seg>
<seg id="2919">The Afghan entrepreneur Ali Khan Qalandari opened the restaurant Peace & amp; Spice and also behind the pizzeria Kabulogna in Bologna and a sushi restaurant in Rome are also Afghans.</seg>
<seg id="2920">But Asharafs targets reach far beyond the Italian restaurant industry and the retail sector and aim back to the country that he forced to leave as a teenager.</seg>
<seg id="2921">"where there is a risk, there are opportunities," says Asharaf with a smile. "I want to invest in Afghanistan.</seg>
<seg id="2922">I have never forgotten my country and I cannot live happily when I know that my people are suffering.</seg>
<seg id="2923">I plan a project for farmers from the poorest provinces of the country, especially for women.</seg>
<seg id="2924">"" "" "" "they represent half of society and have to get the same opportunities as everyone else." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2925">Asharaf also forged plans for the opening of a factory in Kabul, where people can learn packaging and preservation techniques. "so they can sell their crop surpluses on the market and improve their financial situation," he says.</seg>
<seg id="2926">The development of a successful entrepreneur was a journey through uncertainty and doubt, but at the end there is stability and prosperity.</seg>
<seg id="2927">Asharaf has made this journey himself. now he wants to help other Afghans in this way.</seg>

<seg id="2929">He reported about the clearance of the camp Raba'a el Adaweya in Cairo, which protested against the removal of President Mohamed Morsi.</seg>

<seg id="2931">Global Voices Advocacys Netizen Report is an international snapshot showing challenges, victories and emerging trends in global Internet rights</seg>
<seg id="2932">The Egyptian parliament has reviewed a bill which foresees that users can use social media such as Twitter or Facebook only after registering with a government authority.</seg>
<seg id="2933">Users must register to use social networks within six months following the successful legislative decision on the authority's website stating their full name and ID number.</seg>
<seg id="2934">Those who missed this step could be sentenced to six months of imprisonment or the triggering of a penalty.</seg>
<seg id="2935">The law, which was promoted by sixty Parliament members, is currently ahead of the legislative and constitutional committee of the Parliament and is to be debated there.</seg>
<seg id="2936">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "may, another MP filed a legislative proposal, in which tougher penalties would be introduced to insult the president or a senior civil servant." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2937">Under Egyptian law, the insult of the president and state institutions is already punishable. however, under the law of law, such an act would be punished with prison and fines, so legal experts of the Tahrir Institute for Middle East Policy.</seg>
<seg id="2938">Should the law be passed, this may mean up to three years imprisonment for the convicted.</seg>
<seg id="2939">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "in addition, this would underpin a political climate in which the right to freedom of expression and freedom of assembly has been in danger for many years." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2940">A striking example is the case of the Egyptian photographer Mahmoud Abo ZID (known as Shawkan) who was arrested on 13 August 2013 when he took photos of violence against demonstrators who demonstrated against the military coup that led to the inauguration of the elected president Mohamed Morsi.</seg>
<seg id="2941">Shawkan was expecting more than 700 protest participants, who were arrested in the same incident, four years in jail for a court appointment.</seg>
<seg id="2942">Recently, his trial was postponed to 20 May, because the prison management failed to arrest the defendants from prison in the courtroom according to human rights groups.</seg>
<seg id="2943">Shawkan threatens the death penalty on the basis of one, so many human rights groups agree, apparent pollution of among others arms, illegal assembly, murder and attempted murder.</seg>
<seg id="2944">In another case, a criminal tribunal in Giza spoke the two journalists Hany Salah-el-Deen and Mosad Al-Barbary. they were indicted for their reporting on pro-Morsi's seat block at Raba'a Al-Adawiya square in Cairo.</seg>
<seg id="2945">The court also reduced the punishments of the journalists Abdullah al-Fakhany, Samhi Mustafa, and Mohamed al-Adly, who were also arrested in the previous case, from 25 years to 5 years.</seg>
<seg id="2946">Tunisian activist listening to leaked documents</seg>
<seg id="2947">May Tunisian authorities spent six hours questioning the interrogation of Sami Ben Gharbia, the co-founder of the independent media platform Nawaat and the Global Voices Advocacy Project.</seg>
<seg id="2948">Ben Gharbia was basically interrogated to a leaked action plan. obsessed plan comes from the President of the Republic who, according to the plan, endorsed a controversial bill of law that would guarantee business people and during the former regime by dictator Zine el-Abidine Ben Ali of corruption.</seg>
<seg id="2949">The document published on 21 April on the website of Nawaat sheds light on how the presidential plans look for the support of the bill.</seg>
<seg id="2950">Ben Gharbia rejected the naming of his sources, specifying Article 11 of the Tunisian Press Code, granting journalists the right to protect their sources.</seg>
<seg id="2951">Nevertheless he appeared in the district court in Tunis on 09th May as a witness in the event.</seg>
<seg id="2952">Does China want to force users of social media to present their badge?</seg>
<seg id="2953">According to new provisions of the Office of Information Office of the People's Republic of China, the users of social media in China require permission before they write or share news in social media.</seg>
<seg id="2954">The regulations also indicate that registration with the full real name will be required.</seg>
<seg id="2955">Analysts assume that the elimination of anonymous comments should be achieved in conversations within social networks. it is still unclear how the authorities will apply these regulations.</seg>
<seg id="2956">Chinese citizens have proposed in the social media to impose these regulations only selectively in order to protect citizen journalism and its independence.</seg>
<seg id="2957">Then do we see ourselves in "WeChat"?</seg>
<seg id="2958">Not in Russia!</seg>
<seg id="2959">In May the state censorship of Russia blocked the access to the latest Chinese messaging app WeChat.</seg>
<seg id="2960">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "according to Roscomnadzor, WeChat neglected to register as" "" "" "" "organiser of the distribution of information" "" "" "". "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2961">This designation is part of a law from 2014, thanks to which the Russian government carries a list of online services that organize the "publication of the information." the law also allows the government to make said services responsible for removing contents and to force them on request to suspend user data.</seg>
<seg id="2962">These websites are currently sites such as Vcontacts and OdnoClassiniki (Russia's two popular social networks), the image board 2.ch.hk, e-mail service mail.Ru and dozens of other services.</seg>
<seg id="2963">Turkish court decrees Wikipedias</seg>
<seg id="2964">A Turkish court had the Wikipedias blocking in Turkey after Wikipedia Administrators refused to erase two English-language articles, the information Turkey supports the jihadists in Syria.</seg>
<seg id="2965">The Turkish Ministry of Transport, Maritime Affairs and Communication announced that the site was closed because it was "a source of information that co-operates with groups in order to make a political diffusion campaign against Turkey."</seg>
<seg id="2966">It is the first time that Turkey is blocking its website completely. it is thus, in addition to China, one of the few countries worldwide, in which access to Wikipedia is not possible.</seg>
<seg id="2967">Britain cannot stop puffing up</seg>
<seg id="2968">After this week of leaked documents, the UK government finds itself in the midst of a targeted consultation with regard to increased surveillance powers that would force Internet service providers to monitor communication in real time and to install Backdoor programs that decrypt data encryption.</seg>
<seg id="2969">The government has consulted telecommunication companies and intelligence agencies regarding the proposal, but has left other technology companies and the civilian population outside.</seg>
<seg id="2970">Despite all this, the consultation continues until May 19. reactions and proposals by members of the public can be forwarded to the Ministry of the Interior.</seg>
