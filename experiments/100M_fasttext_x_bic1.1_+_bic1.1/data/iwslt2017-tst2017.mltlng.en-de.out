this is James Ris@@ en .
they might know him because he won the Pul@@ itzer Prize as New York Times repor@@ ter .
long before anybody heard Edward Snow@@ den , Ris@@ en wrote a book in which he published spectac@@ ularly that the N@@ SA illeg@@ ally listened to tel@@ eph@@ ones of Americans .
but it is another chapter that should leave a lasting impression .
it describes a cat@@ astrop@@ hic US intelligence operation in which the CIA literally handed dra@@ fts to Iran for a nuclear bomb .
if that sounds crazy , read it .
it is an incredible story .
but do you know who the chapter didn &apos;t like ?
the U.S. government .
for almost 10 years , the government has been investigating bre@@ aches and urged him to call his alleged sources .
in this turn , he became a symbol of the government &apos;s pattern of condem@@ ning whi@@ st@@ le@@ blo@@ wers and to spy on journalists .
according to the First Constitution , the media have the right to publish secret information .
but it is impossible to apply this right if media do not receive this information and if they cannot protect the identity of the cour@@ a@@ geous ones that they disclose .
so when the government kno@@ cked at Ris@@ en , he did something that many cour@@ a@@ geous repor@@ ters had already done before him : he refused and said that he would rather go to prison .
from 2007 to 2015 , Ris@@ en lived with the risk of going to prison .
but then , just days before the trial , something extraordinary happened .
suddenly , although they have been for years that it would be essential for their case , the demands of the government have been dropped to cracks .
the reason : in the time of electronic surveillance , repor@@ ters and sources can hide themselves less and less .
instead of spl@@ itting and spl@@ itting cracks , they could also carry out their digital foot@@ prints for him .
and so the investig@@ ators , without his consent , kept his phone in secret ,
just like his e @-@ mail data , financial and bank information , his credit , and even hor@@ semen with the list of his flights .
in the midst of this information , they found evidence that they used to condemn Jeff@@ rey Sterling , a CIA whi@@ st@@ leb@@ lower and Ris@@ en alleged source .
unfortunately , this is only one of many cases .
President Obama promised to protect whi@@ st@@ leb@@ lower . but instead , the judi@@ ci@@ ary condemned more than all U.S. governments in front of him .
now you can imagine how this can be a problem , especially because the government classi@@ fies too much of its work as secret .
since September 11 , almost every article about national security was the result of a whi@@ st@@ leb@@ lower went to a journalist .
so we put the press work on the game , which is to be protected by the first constitutional review , because the government has more and more possibilities to spy on all .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but just as the government allows the government to circum@@ vent the rights of repor@@ ters , the press can also use technologies to better protect their sources . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and they can do that from the moment they contact , rather than in hin@@ d@@ sight , in the witness stand .
today there is communication software that did not exist when ris@@ king had written his book , and it is much safer than normal e @-@ mails or phone calls .
such a technology is Secure@@ Drop , an open @-@ source transmission system for whi@@ st@@ leb@@ lower , which was originally developed by the internet @-@ famous Aaron Swar@@ tz , and is now developed by the Freedom of the Press Foundation in which I work .
instead of sending an email , go to a news site , just like the Washington Post here .
there you can upload documents or send information , just as with any usual contact form .
these are then encrypted and stored on a server to which only the respective news agency has access .
so the government cannot obtain information secretly , and many of the information they request would not be available from the outset .
however , Secure@@ Drop is only a small part of the whole to protect press freedom in the 21st century .
unfortunately governments around the world are developing new sp@@ ying technologies that end@@ anger all of us .
it is important to us to ensure that not only technology experts such as Edward Snow@@ den have an opportunity to apply their mis@@ deeds . it is just as important that we protect the next whi@@ st@@ leb@@ lower ,
who knows about gri@@ ev@@ ances in the supply of soldiers and reports of crowded hospitals . or the next environmental employee who suggests the alarm to the contaminated water of F@@ lin@@ t . or a wall street in@@ sider that warns us of the next financial crisis .
after all , these technologies were not only made for those who want to expose crime , but to protect our all constitutional rights .
thank you .
&#91; on April 3 , 2016 , the biggest data leak of history has been published . &#93; &#91; the &quot; Panama Pap@@ ers &quot; reveal that rich and powerful &#93; &#91; huge sums of money have hidden tax ha@@ v@@ ens . &#93; &#91; what does this mean ? &#93; &#91; we asked Robert Pal@@ mer from Global Wit@@ ness for an explanation . &#93; this week we were sent by news about a leak of 11 million documents of the Panama @-@ based law firm Mos@@ elle Fon@@ sec@@ a
the publication of these documents gives a small insight into the secret world of tax ha@@ v@@ ens .
we get an impression of how customers , banks and lawyers come to companies like Mos@@ elle Fon@@ sec@@ a and say : &quot; okay , we need an anonymous company . can you set up that ? &quot;
we actually see the emails , the exchange of messages , how the whole system works as it works .
this has already led to very direct consequences .
Iceland &apos;s prime minister has res@@ ig@@ ned .
there are also reports that an ally of the brutal Syrian dict@@ ator B@@ asch@@ ar al @-@ Assad has in tax ha@@ v@@ ens .
it is alleged that a track of USD 2 billion leads to Russian President Vladimir Putin , a close friend of children &apos;s days , a famous cel@@ list .
now there will be a lot of rich people out there and others waiting nerv@@ ously for the next release , and on the next revealed documents .
now that sounds like the plot of an agent &apos;s agent or a John @-@ Gr@@ is@@ ham novel .
it seems to we@@ ep away from you , me , ordinary people .
why should we do that ?
but the truth is : if the rich and powerful are able to hide their fortun@@ es in tax ha@@ v@@ ens and not pay all their taxes , this means less money for important public services such as health care , education , roads .
and this affects all of us .
for my organization , Global Wit@@ ness , these revelations are phenom@@ enal .
all over the world , media and leading politicians are discussing how secret tax ha@@ v@@ ens are used by a few people to hide and disgu@@ ise their assets -- something that we have been discussing and revealing for ten years .
I think many people seem very conf@@ using this whole world , and it is hard to understand how these tax ha@@ v@@ ens work .
I always imagine it like a Mat@@ r@@ jo@@ sch@@ kap@@ u@@ ppe .
so you have a company in another company , in another company , which makes it almost impossible to really understand who is behind these gi@@ ants .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it can be very difficult for law enforcement and tax authorities , as well as for journalists or civil society to really understand what matters . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I also find it interesting that there are fewer reports on this matter in the USA .
probably because there were so far no prominent Americans who came to this sc@@ andal in these revelations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now it is not that there are no wealthy Americans who hide their wealth in tax ha@@ v@@ ens . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but by the principle of which these tax ha@@ v@@ ens work , Mos@@ elle Fon@@ sec@@ a has less American customers .
if we had a data leak from the Cay@@ man Islands or even from Del@@ aware , Wy@@ oming or Nevada , we would see much more cases and examples that have connections to the USA .
in fact , in some US states you need less information to provide less information to create a company than to get a library card .
this kind of in@@ transparency in the US has allowed employees of school districts to rip off school children .
it has allowed sc@@ amm@@ ers to rip off especially suscep@@ tible de@@ posit@@ ors .
it is this kind of behavior that affects all of us .
here at Global Wit@@ ness we wanted to find out how all this looks in practice .
how does it work ?
so we sent a cover@@ t investig@@ ator into the offices of 13 law firms in Manhattan .
our investig@@ ator , as an African minister , wanted to bring suspi@@ cious money to the US to buy a house , a yacht , a private jet .
we really shocked that all except for a lawyer made suggestions on how he could transfer his money .
none of these lawyers accepted us as clients , and of course no one was given money . but it shows the problem with this system .
it is also important not to consider this as individual cases .
it is not about a single lawyer who has submitted suggestions to our cover@@ t investig@@ ator .
it &apos;s not about a single top politi@@ cian involved in a sc@@ andal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is about how the system works , through corruption , tax ev@@ asion , poverty and inst@@ ability . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and to cope with this , we have to change the rules of the game .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need to change the rules to complic@@ ate this type of behaviour . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this may sound very sensi@@ cal as if we could do nothing against it ; as if nothing ever changed ; as if there will always be the rich and powerful .
but as a borrow@@ er optim@@ ist I see quite that some changes have begun .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; over the past few years we have seen more transparency regarding the owners of companies . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the subject found political attention by British Prime Minister David Cameron on the G@@ 8 summit in 2013 in Northern Ireland .
since then , the EU has captured in central registers on a national level who is really behind companies in Europe and who controls them .
one of the uncomfortable facts is that the US is lag@@ ging behind here .
representatives of both parties have proposed legislation in both parliamentary chambers , but this does not make the progress we would like to see .
we would really like to see how these Panama revelations , this huge insight into the world of tax ha@@ v@@ ens , is used as a means to ensure greater transparency in the US and globally .
for us in Global Wit@@ ness this is a moment for change .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need ordinary people who will be angry when they see how other people can hide their true identity behind head@@ lights . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need executives in the economy that stand up and say : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; transparency is not good for business . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need leading politicians who recognize the problem and commit themselves to end this kind of in@@ transparency by laws . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; together , we can finally end the in@@ transparency which now allows this kind of tax ev@@ asion , corruption and money la@@ under@@ ing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is the story of how I almost ab@@ duc@@ ted and landed in the trunk of a red Maz@@ da .
one day after I finished my design studies , I made a post@@ age sale .
a guy in the red Maz@@ da stopped and looked at my stuff .
he bought one of my works of art .
he was alone in the city and just made a road@@ trip across the country . after that he would go to the peace cor@@ ps .
I invited him on a beer . he told me how he wanted to change the world .
it was late . I got tired .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; while we paid the bill , I made the mistake to ask him : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; where are you sleeping today ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he made the whole thing worse : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know yet . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and I thought , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Oh , man ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
what do I do now ? &quot;
who does not know the situation ?
do I have to offer a sleeping place now ?
but I just got to know him ! he says he would go to the peace Corps , but I don &apos;t know if he really plans that . I don &apos;t want to land in the trunk of a Maz@@ da !
this is a small boot !
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; then I heard say : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have an air mattress . you can sleep in my living room . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a voice in my head said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A@@ live , how please ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at night I was lying in bed , I star@@ ed at the ceiling and thought , &quot; Oh man ! what did I rock ?
a wild stranger sleeps in my living room .
what if he &apos;s crazy ? &quot;
I got such a fear that I went out of bed , embarrass@@ ed at the door to the door , and my bedroom door closed .
but he wasn &apos;t crazy at all .
we are still in touch .
the artwork he had bought from me hangs today in his classroom . he is now a teacher .
this was my first experience as a host . it completely changed my perspective .
perhaps the people who were sold to me in childhood were actually friends who were only waiting to be discovered ?
to house people on my air mattress was normal for me . when I moved to San Francisco I took the air mattress .
let &apos;s take a leap , two years later ...
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am unemployed , almost broke , my room@@ mate is pulling off and the rent is increased . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I learned that at that time there was a design conference in the city . all hotels were fully booked .
I think creativity can create fear of turning fear into fun .
I wrote to my best friend and new room@@ mate Brian Ch@@ es@@ ky : &quot; Brian , I thought about how we could deserve something . our apartment becomes a designer bed and breakfast . young designers can stay with us , Wi @-@ Fi and a desk included , with a mattress and breakfast each morning .
ha ! &quot;
we created a website and founded so &quot; air matt@@ resses and breakfast &quot; &#91; AI@@ R@@ B and Breakfast = Air@@ b@@ n@@ b &#93; .
three happy guests were allowed to sleep for 20 dollars on the air mattress on wooden floors .
they found it great , and we too .
I &apos;m sure our cheese @-@ ham @-@ om@@ el@@ ets ta@@ sted completely different because we made them for our guests .
we tou@@ red with them throughout the city . when we said good@@ bye to our last guest and the door fell into the castle , Brian and I started .
had we just discovered that we could at the same time find new friends and pay our rent ?
things came rolling .
my former room@@ mate , N@@ ate Ble@@ char@@ czy@@ k , joined us as a developer .
we wanted to find out if we could make a business concept out of it .
so we presented to investors : &quot; we want to create a website where people publicly post images of their private rooms , their bedrooms , their bathrooms -- the kind of room whose doors are closed when visiting .
over the Internet , they can then invite wild people to stay with them .
that will be the next big thing ! &quot;
we were warned that the mis@@ sile would ign@@ ite .
but they are not .
no one who is still in comfort would invest in a business that allows strangers to sleep in apartments of other people .
why ?
because as children we all learned that strangers are dangerous .
if you have a problem , you look at things that you can do well . we have been able to design .
at the art acade@@ my we had learned that design is much more than just appearance and hap@@ tics -- it &apos;s the overall experience .
we had learned how to design objects , but now we wanted to create immense confidence in design , between people who had never met before .
can design make such a thing ?
is it possible to create confidence with design ?
I would like to give you a taste of what degree of trust we are striving for .
it &apos;s a 30 @-@ second experiment . it will force you out of your comfort zone .
thumb up when you are ready .
take your mobile phone in your hand .
now I want you to unlock your mobile phone .
type your locked mobile phone to your left seat neighbour .
this quiet touch of panic that you feel now -- -- is exactly what hosts feel when they open the door for the first time .
because the only thing that is more personal than your mobile phone is your home .
visitors can not only read their SMS , they see your bedroom , your kitchen , your toilet .
how does it feel to hold the un@@ locked mobile phone of a stranger in your hands ?
most sense the responsibility .
most guests feel like they stay somewhere else .
only for this reason can our company exist .
just so , who actually has Al Gor@@ es mobile phone ?
could you please announce on Twitter that he is chann@@ elled to the president &apos;s office ?
you can return the mobile phones now .
you have now experienced what kind of trust we want to build up . I want to tell you about some discoveries .
what if we had changed a little detail about this experiment ?
what if your neighbour would have imagined once with his name ; if he had told where he comes from , how his dog or his children are called ?
imagine you had 150 evaluations that all say : &quot; he can really hold very well un@@ locked mobile phones ! &quot;
how would you feel if you had to leave your mobile phone ?
because a well @-@ thought out feedback system strengthens trust decisi@@ vely .
in the beginning we have done some things wrong .
it was hard for people to surrender negative jud@@ gements .
in the end , we decided to wait until both hosts and guest left their assessments before making them online .
last week we discovered something new .
we conducted a study with Stan@@ ford . we examined how likely it is that people trust each other , depending on how similar they are about age and place of residence .
little surprise we entr@@ ust most of the people who are most similar to us .
the more differences we find , the less we trust .
this is a natural social bias .
it will be exciting when you add a person &apos;s reputation -- in our case through jud@@ gements .
if you have less than three assessments , nothing changes .
but if you have more than ten , everything changes .
a good reputation creates simil@@ arities .
the right design can help us to overcome some of our deeply rooted preferences .
we also learned that trust is dependent on how much you eat of yourself .
here you can see the reactions to the first message of a guest .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you tell too little , for example , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hi ! , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you won &apos;t get an answer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we tell too much , for example : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have problems with my mother , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; -- the request is not accepted . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
so there is an optimal degree of openness , e.g. &quot; Great works of art in your home ! I &apos;m making a holiday with my family . &quot;
how can you design it with design to make this degree of openness ?
we use the size of the text field to recommend the right amount of text . we also give tips on which topics to write something .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our entire company is building up hope that the right design can help overcome our prejudi@@ ces against strangers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
what we did not expect was the great deal of people who were more than willing to take away these prejudi@@ ces .
here you see how many people take advantage of our offer .
you can see three things .
first , incredibly good luck .
second , the ti@@ rel@@ ess work of our team .
third : a need not previously covered .
the business is very good for us .
of course there are times when not everything runs smoothly .
there were guests who have not allowed parties to celebrate or devast@@ ate apartments .
hosts have allowed guests to stand in the rain .
at the beginning of the project I worked in the customer service . all calls came directly to my mobile phone .
I stood at the front line when confidence was broken .
there is nothing worse than those calls . it hur@@ ts when I just think about it .
the dis@@ appointment that one hears in the voice of the call@@ ers was and will always be our greatest motivation to further improve .
fortunately , the 123 million spent overnight stays only a fraction of a problem .
for people trusted one another in judgment .
if trust works , miracle can occur .
one of our guests made holidays in Uruguay . there he suffered a heart attack .
his host drove him to the hospital .
he even donated blood for the necessary surgery !
here is his judgement :
&quot; perfect house for travelers who incline to heart attacks due to sitting activities .
the area is beautiful and equipped with ample hospitals .
J@@ avier and Ale@@ j@@ andra are real guar@@ dian angels who save life even though they don &apos;t know one at all .
you drive one in your own car to the hospital , when you die , and wait while you get a b@@ ypass .
because they don &apos;t want you to feel lonely , they bring books past .
they let one even stay longer without calculating the extra nights .
I can only recommend it ! &quot;
of course , not every stay is going on .
but these relationships behind the pure money transaction are exactly what you want to achieve with the Share economy .
when I stum@@ bled across this term for the first time , I asked myself :
how does the idea of sharing work with money transactions ?
it is a commercial trade .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but it is not just the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; rental industry &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
share Economy describes a trade that promises human relationships .
people lay a part of themselves openly , and that changes everything .
if you are travelling today , fast food is to be compared . it is efficient and reliable , but less authentic .
what if traveling would be a rich buffet of local impressions ?
what would be , if at any place you visited , a group there would be waiting to fill a thoroughly and show one in a pub trip district of which one never heard of ;
or if you could learn cooking from a five @-@ star chef ?
nowadays , apartments are designed according to the principle of privacy .
what if we were to create apartments from the ground up to one another ?
what would it look like ?
what if cities would accept the idea of sharing a shared part ?
I imagine cities that allow society and relationships rather than lon@@ el@@ iness and isolation .
this project has already begun in Seoul &apos;s capital city of Seoul . lots of parking spaces that were owned by the government ,
were now offered to residents . students who were looking for a residence permit ,
were taught to people whose children were moved out . incu@@ b@@ ator programs were launched ,
to finance new start @-@ ups in the Share economy . over our platform alone will be 7@@ 85 000 people in 191 countries to be hosted by a stranger or even host .
so the idea doesn &apos;t seem to be as crazy as it was taught to us .
we didn &apos;t re@@ inv@@ ent the wheel .
there was also hospitality before .
there were similar websites before us .
so why did our work ?
apart from luck and timing , we realized that one can find the right design with the components of trust .
design can help us overcome deep @-@ rooted prejudi@@ ces .
I find this amazing ,
almost overwhelming .
I have to think about it every time a red Maz@@ da passes by me .
we know , of course , that design cannot solve every problem .
but if it could help us , if it had this great influence , I wonder why we can use design in the near future .
thank you .
what do you think if you look at me ?
a beli@@ ever ? an expert ?
maybe even a sister .
or oppressed , bra@@ in@@ washed , a terrorist ?
or simply a delay during the security check at the airport .
this is indeed true .
I don &apos;t blame you for your negative impressions .
so the media are people who look like me .
a study revealed that 80 % of the reporting about Islam and Muslims is negative .
studies show : Americans mean , most would not know Muslims .
probably people don &apos;t talk with their U@@ ber drivers .
for those who have never met a Muslim : it &apos;s great to get to know you .
I tell you who I am .
I am a mother , a coffee lover -- double espresso , with cream extra .
I &apos;m intro@@ ver@@ ted ,
a car@@ rot @-@ fitness fan@@ atic ,
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and I am a practicing , spiritual Muslim . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but not like Lady G@@ aga sings , because , baby , I was not born like that .
I decided to do so .
when I was 17 years old , I decided to ou@@ ten me .
no , not as a hom@@ os@@ exual person , like some of my friends , but as a Muslim . I decided to wear the Hi@@ j@@ ab , my head cover .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my femin@@ ist friends were horri@@ fied : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why do you op@@ press yourself ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the funny thing was : back then it was a femin@@ ist declaration of independence for me , and in contrast to the pressure that I felt as a 17 @-@ year @-@ old , to adapt me to a perfect and un@@ at@@ tain@@ able beauty ideal .
I have not only pas@@ sively accepted the faith of my parents .
I have strug@@ gled with the Qur &apos;@@ an .
I read it , thought , questioned , doub@@ ted and finally believed .
my relationship with God was not love at first sight .
she was trust and slow devotion that deep@@ ened by reading the Qur &apos;@@ an .
the beauty of the rhythm sometimes brings me to cry .
I recognize myself in it . I feel God knows me .
did you ever feel that someone perc@@ ei@@ ves you , fully understands you , and yet somehow loves you ?
that &apos;s how it feels .
later I mar@@ ries and began , like all the good Egyptians , my career as an engineer .
later , after my marriage , I had a child and basically lived the &quot; Egyptian @-@ American Dream . &quot;
then came that terrible morning in September 2001 .
many of you probably remember exactly where they were there .
I sat in my kitchen , had breakfast in the end , looked at the screen and saw the word &quot; breaking news . &quot;
there was smoke , air@@ planes flying into buildings , people ran out of the buildings .
what was that ?
an accident ?
a technical mal@@ function ?
my shock quickly turned into indignation .
why should you do something like that ?
I changed the television channel and heard : ... &quot; Muslim terrorists ... &quot; ... in the name of Islam ... &quot; ... &quot; Middle @-@ Eastern origin ... &quot; ... &quot; ... Ji@@ had ... &quot; ... &quot; bom@@ bed Mec@@ ca ! &quot;
Oh my God .
it has not only been attacked by my country , but in the N@@ u the deeds of others transformed me from a citizen into a susp@@ ects .
the same day we had to go through the Mid@@ west of the USA to move to a new city and start with post@@ graduate studies .
I remember how I felt -- when we went silent -- so deep it went into my seat , and I was the first time afraid to be recognized as a Muslim .
we moved into our apartment this night , in a new city where it felt like a completely different world .
and then I saw and read the warnings of the national Islamic organisations saying , &quot; Be watch@@ ful , &quot; &quot; Be watch@@ ful , &quot; &quot; Be careful , &quot; &quot; Rem@@ ain in well @-@ lit areas , &quot; &quot; Don &apos;t be sil@@ enced . &quot;
I stayed inside for the whole week .
then it was Friday that week -- the day when Muslims gather to pray .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and again the warnings came : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; do not go on this first Friday , the mos@@ que could be a target . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I looked at the extensive coverage .
the feelings were understand@@ ably un@@ filtered and I also heard about attacks on Muslims or people that were held for Muslims .
there were really sur@@ charges on mos@@ ques .
I thought : we should stay at home .
but something didn &apos;t feel right .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because the people who attacked this land have attacked our country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have critic@@ ised the anger of the people on the terrorists . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
imagine ! I was angry too .
it is not easy to constantly explain itself .
I have nothing against questions , I love questions .
it is the accus@@ ations that are hard .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today we can actually hear people say : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is a problem in this country -- it is called Muslims . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
when will we get rid of them ? &quot;
some people want to ban@@ ish Muslims and close mos@@ ques .
they speak of my church like a tumor in the USA &apos;s body .
only the question arises : are we malign@@ ant or ben@@ ign ?
they know : a malign@@ ant tumour is removed as a whole and a ben@@ ign tumour is only kept under observation .
the alternatives are meaning@@ less because the question is wrong .
like all other Americans , Muslims are not a tumour in the US &apos;s body , but a vital organ .
thank you !
Muslims are invent@@ ors and teachers , first resp@@ onder@@ s and Olympi@@ ans .
will the closure of mos@@ ques America make safer ?
it might release a few parking spaces , but will not stop terror .
the regular visit of a mos@@ que leads to observing people of other fai@@ ths more toler@@ ant , and showing greater citizen participation .
and as a leader of the police in the Washington area , DC recently said : people are actually not radic@@ alised in mos@@ ques .
they are radic@@ alised in their basement or in bed in front of a computer .
when it comes to the radic@@ alisation process , it has been established that it begins online . first , the person is cut off from their community , even from their family , so that the extrem@@ ist group can make a bra@@ in@@ washing that leads to the fact that the person believes that the terrorists are the true Muslims , and anyone who ab@@ h@@ ors their behavior and ideology is a tra@@ it@@ or or a tra@@ it@@ or .
if we want to prevent radic@@ alization , we have to stop people to go to the mos@@ que .
some will still claim that Islam is a violent religion .
finally , a group like the IS establishes its brut@@ ality with the Kor@@ an .
as a Muslim , as a mother , as a human , I believe that we have to do everything to stop a group like the IS .
but we would add to their imagination if one recognizes them as representatives of 1.6 billion believers .
thank you !
the IS has so much to do with Islam , as the K@@ u @-@ Klu@@ x cl@@ an with Christianity .
both groups asser@@ t their ideology in their &quot; Holy Book . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but if you have a look at them , they do not drive what they read in their &quot; Holy Scripture . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is their brut@@ ality , which lets them read these things into Scripture .
an outstanding Ima@@ m recently told me an amazing story :
a girl came to him because she pre@@ tended to join the IS .
I was really surprised and asked if she had been in contact with radical religious leaders .
he said the problem was just the opposite . every priest with whom she spoke , brought her to silence and told her that her anger , her sense of injustice in the world , would only bring her into trouble .
inspired by nothing and something that would make sense to their fur@@ y , it was a major goal for the instrument@@ alization of extre@@ mi@@ sts who promised a solution .
this Ima@@ m restored the connection to God and its church .
instead of acc@@ using them of their anger , he showed their constructive ways of real change in the world .
what she learned in the mos@@ que kept her from joining the IS .
this was an insight into how Islam@@ opho@@ bia affects me and my family .
but how does it affect normal Americans ?
how does it affect everyone else ?
how does the 24 @-@ hour consumption of fear affect our democracy every day , on our freedom of thought ?
one study -- actually several neuro@@ scientific studies -- show that if we fear , at least three things happen .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we rather accept an author@@ itarian government system , conformity , and prejudi@@ ce . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
one study shows that if you submit a test to test persons with negative reports about Muslims , they rather agree with military attacks on Muslim countries , as well as the circumcision of the rights of American Muslims .
this is not just an academic problem .
if you are looking when the mood of Muslims rise up -- between 2001 and 2013 -- this happened three times , but never in connection with terrorist attacks .
it happened in the run @-@ up to the Iraq war and during two electoral periods .
so Islam@@ opho@@ bia is not simply the natural response to Muslim terrorism as I have expected .
it can actually be a tool for the manipulation of the public in order to under@@ mine the foundation of a free society that has reasonable and well informed citizens .
dealing with Muslims is an early warning sign .
we may feel it first , but the toxic air of fear har@@ ms us all .
the assignment of collective guilt is not only about having to explain itself .
De@@ ah and his wife Y@@ us@@ or were a young married couple living in Chapel Hill , North Carolina , where both went to school .
De@@ ah was a sports@@ man .
he was talented in the department of dental medicine , talented , promising ...
his sister would tell me that he was the sweet@@ est , most generous person she knew .
she visited him there and he showed her his resume . she was amazed and said :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when is such a young man from my bro@@ therhood ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
just a few weeks after the visit of Su@@ z@@ anne with her brother and wife , her neighbor , Cra@@ ig Stephen Hi@@ cks , murdered her , just like the sister of Y@@ us@@ or , Raz@@ an , who was visiting in the afternoon .
he shot eight times on De@@ ah .
fan@@ ati@@ cism can be fatal , not only im@@ moral , but also fatal .
so back to the beginning .
what happened after the 9 / 11 ?
did we go to the mos@@ que or were we safe at home ?
we discussed it and for us it was not an easy decision , as it was about what America we want to leave our children : one that would control us through fear , or one in which we can freely ex@@ ert our religion .
we chose the mos@@ que .
with our son in the children &apos;s seat , we ro@@ de in silence , with high pressure to the mos@@ que .
I took him out , pulled out my shoes , went to the prayer hall , and what I saw let me stop .
the hall was completely filled .
then the Ima@@ m made an announcement , thank@@ ed us and welcomed our guests , because half of the assemblies were Christians , Jews , Budd@@ hi@@ sts , a@@ thei@@ sts , believers and non @-@ believers who came not to attack us , but to assist us .
at that moment I collap@@ sed .
these people were there because they had preferred courage and compassion for panic and prejudi@@ ce .
what will you choose ?
what will you choose in the moment of fear and fan@@ ati@@ cism ?
will you be safe on number ?
or will you join those who think that we are better than yours .
thank you very much .
thank you very much !
Hel@@ en Wal@@ ters : so D@@ alia , you seem to have hit a nerve .
but I wonder what you say to those who might say that you are holding a TE@@ D@@ Talk , a thin@@ ker with drau@@ ght , working in a noble think tank , so an exception and not the rule .
what would you say to those people ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; D@@ alia Mo@@ g@@ ah@@ ed : I would say , don &apos;t be fo@@ ol@@ ed . I am completely normal . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I am no exception .
my story is not unusual .
I am as usual as it is allowed .
when you look at Muslims all over the world , and I did this with the largest ever conducted study on Muslims all over the world , people want normal things .
they want prosperity for the family , they want work and they want to live in peace .
so I &apos;m not an exception in any way .
when people appear as an exception to rule , then often the rule has been broken , and they are not the exception to the rule .
H@@ W : thank you . D@@ alia Mo@@ g@@ ah@@ ed .
what started as a platform for hob@@ by@@ ists is about to become a billi@@ on@@ aire business .
control , environmental monitoring , photography , film and journ@@ alism : these are some of the possible applications for commercial dr@@ ones . this is made possible in research facilities worldwide .
before air @-@ Pak@@ ist@@ em@@ atics arrived in our social consciousness , an autonomous fleet of flying machines in the Fra@@ c Centre in France built a six @-@ metre @-@ high tower of 1 500 bricks in front of the audience . some years ago they began to fly with ropes .
by connecting flights , flight units reach high speed and acceleration in the smallest space .
they can also build independently tension @-@ bearing structures .
they have learned to bear burdens , deal with turbul@@ ence and generally react to natural laws .
today we would like to show you a few of our new projects .
our goal is to exceed the limits of what is possible in the autonomous flight .
in order for a system to operate autonom@@ ously , it must be coll@@ ectively aware of where the mobile objects are located in the room .
in our laboratory at the ETH Zurich we often use external cameras to find objects , which enables us to focus on the rapid development of dynamic tasks .
for today &apos;s demo@@ s we use a new loc@@ alization technology from Ver@@ ity Studios , a branch of our laboratories .
there are no external cameras .
each flight machine has internal sensors to determine the position in the room , determine calculations on board what the machine should do .
there are external commands on the highest level e. g. &quot; start &quot; and &quot; land . &quot;
this is a so @-@ called stern starter ,
a flying machine trying to hit two flies with one flap .
like other starter motor , it is efficient in forward flight , much more efficient than helicopter in all its variations .
unlike most tak@@ ers , it can float , and therefore has great advantages in starting and landing , and is very versatile .
however , there is always a down@@ side .
a limitation of rear @-@ star@@ ters is that they react sensi@@ tively to turbul@@ ence such as wind gu@@ sts .
we develop new controllers and algorithms to improve this .
the idea behind it is that the flight machine no matter in which position the optimum position is achieved and the performance can be improved by practicing .
okay .
during our research , we often ask ourselves fundamental abstract questions that penetrate the core of the matter .
one such question would be : what is the smallest possible number of moving parts for controlled flights ?
there are practical reasons for wanting to know the answer to such a question .
helicop@@ ters are known as machines with a thousand moving parts that meet to hurt you .
decades ago trained pilots were able to fly remote @-@ controlled aircraft , which had only two moving parts : a prop@@ eller and a stern ru@@ dder .
recently we discovered that flying with only one works .
this is the mon@@ osp@@ iser , the mechanically most remote @-@ controlled aircraft . it was invented recently .
it has only one moving part , a prop@@ eller ,
no fl@@ aps , hing@@ es and cross @-@ rods , no further actuators or control surfaces , only one prop@@ eller .
although it is mechanical simple , very much happens in the inner life so that it can fly stable and move everywhere in the room .
nevertheless , it does not have the elegant algorithm of the rear @-@ star@@ ters . to get it to fly , I have to throw it exactly right .
the probability of throwing it right is low , so I &apos;ll show you a video that was filmed last night .
if the Mon@@ osp@@ inner is an exercise in indul@@ gence , this machine is here , the Omni@@ cop@@ ter with its eight prop@@ ellers , an exercise in excess .
what to do with all this abundance ?
they see that it is di@@ amet@@ rically symmet@@ rical .
that is why he is ambi@@ valent in his alignment .
as a result , he receives the extraordinary ability ,
move in space in all directions , no matter what direction it is rot@@ ated or even how it rot@@ ates .
of course it is complex , mainly in the area of interactive rivers of the eight prop@@ ellers .
some models can be represented in models , the rest is learned directly when flying .
let &apos;s look at this .
when flying machines are to be part of our everyday life , they must be extremely secure and reliable .
this machine consists of two separate two @-@ prop@@ eller aircraft .
this rot@@ ates clock@@ wise
and the other anti @-@ clock@@ wise .
when you assemble them , they behave like a high @-@ performance quad@@ ro@@ cop@@ ter .
however , if something goes wrong -- a motor or prop@@ eller falls off , the electronics or a battery -- the machine can fly further even if constra@@ ined .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will now demonstrate this by making a half f@@ light@@ less . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the last demonstration uses synthetic s@@ war@@ ms .
the large number of autonomous , coordinated units allows a range of aesthetic expression .
we took commercial micro @-@ quad@@ cop@@ ters -- each individual weighs less than one slice of bread -- and equi@@ ps them with loc@@ alization technology and algorithms .
each unit knows where it is and is self @-@ controlled . that &apos;s why there is no upper limit .
hopefully these demonstrations motiv@@ ate you to think about new revolutionary ideas .
the very safe machine as it wants to be a flying lamp shade on Broadway .
of course , it is difficult to predict the impact of this technology .
for types like us lies the wage in the development and the creative act .
it serves as a reminder of how wonderful and enchanting our universe is , and that creative , wise creations are allowed to shape them in such a spectacular way .
the fact that this technology has such massive commercial and economic potential is the icing on the cake .
thank you very much .
1.3 billion years ago , two black holes cir@@ cl@@ ed each other in a very far distant gal@@ axy . they turned the mass of three suns into pure energy in a tenth of a second .
for this short moment , they lit up bri@@ ghter than all the stars together in all the gal@@ ax@@ ies of the entire universe known to us .
it was a very big b@@ ang .
but they did not release their energy in the form of light --
we finally talk about black holes .
the whole energy was released into space @-@ time @-@ structure itself and the universe explo@@ ded into gravit@@ ational @-@ waves .
let us first arrange the events tempor@@ ally .
1.3 billion years ago , it was just multi @-@ cell life on Earth .
since then the earth has brought forth a lot : cor@@ als , fish , plants , din@@ osau@@ rs , humans and -- God is on us -- even the internet .
about 25 years ago , a group of specially cour@@ a@@ geous -- Ra@@ i Weiss from MIT , Ki@@ p Thor@@ ne and Ron@@ ald Dre@@ ver from Cal@@ tech -- decided to build a huge laser detector to search for gravit@@ ational @-@ waves , which occur approximately by col@@ lo@@ zing black holes .
most of them thought they were crazy .
but enough people recognized them as crazy geni@@ uses , so the US National Science Foundation financed its idea .
after decades of development , construction , conception and extremely hard work they built the Det@@ ector Lig@@ o : the laser interfer@@ omet@@ er- gravit@@ ational wave Observ@@ atory .
in the follow @-@ up period , the precision of lig@@ o could be significantly increased , resulting in an enormous improvement in recognition performance .
therefore it is called Advanced Lig@@ o .
at the beginning of September 2015 , Lig@@ o was launched for a final test run to clarify some minor , stub@@ born problems .
on 14 September 2015 , only a few days after the start @-@ up of the detector , the gravit@@ ational @-@ waves of the two colli@@ ding black holes ro@@ cked through the earth .
they went through you and me
and also through the detector .
Scott Hu@@ gh@@ es : only two moments in my life were more emotional than this :
the birth of my daughter
and the f@@ arewell from my sick father .
in essence , these were the fruits of my life .
all that I had worked for is no longer science fiction ! AA : this is my very good friend and colleague Scott Hu@@ gh@@ es , theoretical physi@@ cist at MIT . he has been studying gravit@@ ational @-@ waves from black holes and her through observ@@ atories like lig@@ o meas@@ urable signals . but what are gravit@@ ational @-@ waves ?
a wave of gravity is a c@@ row in the fabric of space and time .
when moving the shaft , the space and its entire content are stretched in one direction and stri@@ pped into the other .
for illustration , lec@@ turers in courses on rel@@ ativity theory often perform a truly alpine dance .
&quot; stretching and du@@ sting , stretching and du@@ sting . &quot;
the problem is that gravit@@ ational @-@ waves are extremely weak , even ridi@@ culous .
on September 14th , for example , each of us was stretched and st@@ owed by us when the waves were hit . the el@@ on@@ gation of an average man was 10 high -@@ 21 .
that is 20 zer@@ os after the comm@@ a , followed by a 1st Therefore , the Lig@@ o employees declared crazy .
with a five @-@ kilomet@@ re laser detector , and this is already absurd , this length would have to be measured in less than one thous@@ and@@ th of the radius of an atomic nucle@@ us . that &apos;s gr@@ ot@@ esque .
at the end of his classical text about gravit@@ ation
description Ki@@ p Thor@@ ne , a co @-@ founder of Lig@@ os , described the waves as follows : &quot; the technical difficulties in the construction of such detectors are enormous .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but physi@@ cists are in@@ ventive and with the support of the public all obstacles will be overcome . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Thor@@ ne published this 1973 , 42 years before his success .
back to Lig@@ o . Scott claims to be more an ear than an eye .
I would like to explain what this means .
visible light has a wavel@@ ength , which is much smaller than the things around us : facial features , the size of your cell .
this is quite practical , as you can make a picture or map of things by listening to the light coming from several points around you .
with sounds it &apos;s different .
audi@@ ble sounds have a wavel@@ ength of up to 15 meters .
that is why it is very difficult , actually impossible to produce a picture of things that will mean a lot to you :
about the face of your child .
instead we listen to certain characteristics such as pitch and pitch , rhythm and volume to close the story behind it .
&quot; now , Alice is talking . &quot;
&quot; and Bob is interrup@@ ting them . &quot;
&quot; du@@ mmer Bob . &quot;
the same applies to gravit@@ ational @-@ waves .
with them we cannot make simple pictures of objects in space .
but by paying attention to changes in the ampl@@ itude and frequency of the waves , we can listen to their stories .
at least for Lig@@ o , the measured frequencies are in the audi@@ ble range .
so when we convert wave patterns into sound , we can literally hear the universe speak .
the gravit@@ ation to listen can tell us about the collision of two black holes , with which my colleague Scott has been busy for a very long time .
SH : two black , non @-@ rotating holes , chir@@ p easy : w@@ up@@ p !
turn the two bodies very quickly , you can hear the same chir@@ p with an additional sound change . that sounds like : W@@ u @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu !
it is a kind of movement vocabulary , im@@ printed in the wa@@ ve@@ form .
AA : on September 14 , 2015 -- a date that I will never forget -- Lig@@ o heard the following : &#91; sur@@ rendering noise &#93; somebody who knows what he has to hear will recognize this as sound of -- SH : ... two black holes each with 30 @-@ fold solar mass , which turn around as fast as the rods of your mixer .
AA : let &apos;s think about what this means .
two black holes , the dens@@ est body in space , one with a mass of 29 suns , the other with a mass of 36 suns , circle each hundred times a second before they colli@@ de .
imagine these forces .
fantastic .
and we know because we &apos;ve heard it .
there is the lasting significance of Lig@@ o .
Lig@@ o p@@ aves a completely new way to research the universe as it has never been possible before .
on this way we can listen to the universe and hear the invisible .
much in space , we can &apos;t see -- practically or basically -- not .
a super@@ nov@@ a , for example . I would like to know why m@@ asser@@ ol@@ ean stars explo@@ de in super nov@@ as .
they are very useful . from them we have learned a lot about the universe .
but the exciting physical processes happen in the nucle@@ us that lies behind thousands of kilometers of iron , carbon and silicon .
we will never see through as these are op@@ a@@ que .
the Big B@@ ang : I would like to explore the first minutes of the universe , but we will never see them as the Big B@@ ang is covered by its own after@@ glow .
using gravity shafts it should be possible to look back to the beginning .
and the most important thing : I am optim@@ istic that there exist in all things that we have never seen before , which we will never see and of which we have no idea . things we only discover by listening .
in fact , in the first attempt , Lig@@ o found things that we had not expected .
my colleague at MIT , Matt Ev@@ ans , an important member of the Lig@@ o project , says on this subject : me : the kind of stars that produce black holes , as Lig@@ o watches them , are the din@@ osau@@ rs of the universe .
they are enormous , ancient bodies of pre@@ historic times . the black holes are , so to speak , the Sau@@ ri@@ erk@@ no@@ chen for our archaeological work .
Lig@@ o allows us a completely different point of view of the happ@@ enings in space , the emergence of the stars and ultimately also on how we emerged from this chaos .
AA : the challenge is to be as cour@@ a@@ geous as possible .
thanks to Lig@@ o , we know how to build great detectors and listen to the noise and chir@@ ping of the cosmos .
we need ideas for new observ@@ atories - a whole new generation of observ@@ atories on earth and in space .
for what could be nic@@ er than to listen to the Big B@@ ang ?
now is the time of great dreams .
dream with us .
thank you .
some time ago , I experim@@ ented with an experiment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for a year I would say &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Yes ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before I was afraid . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
no matter if it made me nervous , brought me into unpleasant situations , I forced myself to say &quot; Yes . &quot;
did I want to speak to the public ?
no , but yes !
did I want to be live on TV ?
no , but yes !
did I want to start with the show ?
no , no , no , yes , yes , yes .
and a crazy thing happened : doing just that , what I was afraid of , removed my fear .
my fear of keeping speeches , my social anxiety -- pu@@ ff , gone .
the power of a word is impressive .
&quot; yes , &quot; my life has changed .
&quot; yes , &quot; changed me .
but there was a certain Yes that changed my life deeply into an unexpected way . it started with a question of my little ones .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have three incredible daughters , Har@@ per , Beck@@ ett and Emer@@ son . and Emer@@ son , the smallest , calls all &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; kit@@ ten &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for in@@ explic@@ able reasons . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
as if she were a wa@@ it@@ ress from the south .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; kit@@ ten , I need milk for my bill . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
she asked me if I could play with her when I was on the go . and I said , &quot; Yes . &quot;
this Yes was the Beg@@ inning
a new attitude towards life in my family . from then on I swear to always play with them as soon as you ask me to do so . no matter what I &apos;m doing , or where I go , I always say yes -- every single time .
almost . I &apos;m not perfect , but I am very tired .
it has a magical effect on me , my children , to our family .
but it also has an amazing side effect : only recently I fully understood that the &quot; yes &quot; thing to play with my children saved my career .
I have a real dream job .
I am a writer . I think I &apos;m doing things , catch you to life .
dream job .
no . no .
I am a Titan .
dream job .
I create television . I produce television .
I &apos;m doing TV , in a grand style .
in this TV season I am responsible for carrying out 70 hours of program into the world .
four TV programs , 70 hours of television . three to four shows are simultaneously in production .
each shipment has hundreds of jobs that did not exist before .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the budget for an episode of a television station can lie between three and six million dollars . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
let &apos;s say five .
a new episode every nine days four shows , so every nine days 20 million dollars TV , four TV programs , 70 hours TV , three broad@@ casts simultaneously in production four , 16 episodes at the same time : 24 episodes : grey &apos;s , 21 episodes : how To Get A@@ way With Mur@@ der , 10 episodes : the Cat@@ ch , 70 hours television ,
350 million dollars for one season .
in America , my TV series runs one after the other on Thursday evening .
all over the world , my series runs in 256 regions in 67 languages for 30 million viewers .
my brain is global , and 45 of these 70 TV hours are broad@@ casts I created myself and not only produced , so above . I have to find time , really quiet , creative time to gather my fans around the camp@@ fire and tell my stories .
four TV series , 70 hours of television , three , sometimes four , shows at the same time in production , 350 million dollars , bon@@ fires burning around the world .
do you know who else is doing it ?
no one , therefore I am a Titan .
dream job .
I don &apos;t want to impress you .
I say it because I know what you think when the word &quot; author &quot; falls .
I tell you , that all of you who work so hard whether you are managing a company , a country or a classroom , a business or a household , take me seriously when I speak of work , so that you understand that I am not only sitting around on the computer and fan@@ ciful , and it is true when I say : I understand that there is no dream about a dream job .
it &apos;s all a job , all work , all reality , everything blood , all per@@ spir@@ ation -- no tears .
I work a lot , hard and I love it .
when I &apos;m deep@@ ened into work , there is no other feeling .
my work always creates a country out of nowhere .
it is as if I stood up troops when I painted on a canvas .
as you can see a high sound , run a marathon .
one feels like Be@@ y@@ on@@ c@@ é .
and all at the same time .
I love to work .
it is creative , mechanical , ti@@ ring and intoxic@@ ating , funny and disturbing , clin@@ ically and mat@@ ernal , cruel and sensible . and the best of it is the bu@@ zz .
there is such a change in me when the work goes well .
a bu@@ zz starts in my head , and it grows and grows , and the bu@@ zz sounds like a busy road , I could go on it forever .
many people accept when I explain to them the sums that I talk about writing that writing gives me joy .
don &apos;t understand me wrong , it does .
but the bu@@ zz -- when I began to work and work and work , build , create and work together , I discovered this thing , this sum , this energy . the bu@@ zz !
the bu@@ zz is more than writing .
the tot@@ um is action and activity . the bu@@ zz is a drug .
the bu@@ zz is music . the bu@@ zz is light and air .
the hum@@ ming is God &apos;s voice in my ear .
and if you have such a bu@@ zz , then you can &apos;t strive to be different from size .
the feeling of not being able to be different than asp@@ iring to size doesn &apos;t matter what price .
this is called the sums .
or perhaps it also means to be a work@@ ah@@ olic .
maybe it &apos;s called Gen@@ ie .
maybe it &apos;s called ego .
perhaps it is the fear of failure .
I don &apos;t know .
I only know that I am not done for failure , and I only know that I love hum@@ ming .
I just want to tell you , I am a Titan , and I know I don &apos;t want to question it .
in order to make one clear : the more successful I become , the more broad@@ casts , the more cross@@ roads , the more work there is , the more things I write , the more I write history , the more I write .
the more I work to be successful , the more I have to work .
and what did I say about work ?
I love work , isn &apos;t it ?
the country I created , the marathon I run , the army , the screen , the high sound , the tot@@ um , the tot@@ um , the tot@@ um .
I like this sum . I love the bu@@ zz .
I need the sum . I am the sum .
am I only this sum ?
and then the bu@@ zz@@ ing stopped .
over@@ hau@@ led , over@@ loaded , exagger@@ ated , burned out .
the bu@@ zz@@ ing stopped .
now my three daughters are used to the truth that their mom@@ my is a single working title .
Har@@ per tells people : &quot; my mo@@ m won &apos;t be there but you can write my n@@ anny . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and Emer@@ son says , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sur@@ ely I want to go to Sh@@ on@@ da @-@ Land . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is the children of a Tit@@ ans .
they are baby tit@@ ans .
they were 12 , 3 and 1 when the tot@@ um ceased .
the bu@@ zz@@ ing of the engine was silent .
I didn &apos;t love my work any more . the engine was out .
the bu@@ zz@@ ing did not come back .
my bu@@ zz was broken .
I did the same things as always : the same Tit@@ ans work , 15 hours days , worked out weekends , no regret , nothing deleg@@ ating , a titanium does not sleep , doesn &apos;t give up , with all my heart , clear eyes , whatever .
but there was no tot@@ em .
in me was silence .
four TV programs , 70 hours , three productions at the same time , sometimes four .
four TV programs , 70 hours , three productions at the same time ...
I was the perfect titanium .
I was a show Titan ,
everything was grey , I just couldn &apos;t have fun anymore .
and that was my life .
everything I did .
I was the sum and the bu@@ zz I was .
so what do you do if what you do , the work you love suddenly fade away ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I know some may think : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; gras@@ ps you , stupid author @-@ Titan . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but you know you do it , you do , you love what you are doing , being a teacher , a ban@@ ker , a mother , a painter , Bill Gates , you just love another and that gives you the bu@@ zz when you know the bu@@ zz when the bu@@ zz stops , who is you then ?
what are you ?
what am I ?
am I still a Titan ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when the song of my heart is listening , I can survive in silence ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and then my &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; southern state wa@@ it@@ ress &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; asks me a question . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am on the way out , late , and she says , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mama , can you play ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and I want to say no , when two things become aware of me :
first , I must say Yes to everything and secondly , she didn &apos;t call me &quot; kit@@ ten . &quot;
she doesn &apos;t call anybody more &quot; kit@@ ten . &quot;
when is this happening ?
I miss it when I &apos;m Titan and get my bu@@ zz , and here everything changes in front of my own eyes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and so she says , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mama , can you play ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and I say , &quot; Yes . &quot;
there is nothing special about it .
we play and her sisters come across , we laugh a lot and I read quite dramatically from the book &quot; Every@@ body Po@@ ops . &quot;
nothing extraordinary .
but it &apos;s outstanding because my pain and panic , lon@@ el@@ iness and lack of money , I can &apos;t do anything except to watch out .
I am focused .
I am quiet .
the country I created , the marathon I run , the army , the screen , the high sound - they no longer exist .
all that exists are sti@@ cky fingers and wet kis@@ ses , delicate voices , wax sc@@ ents and the song in which it is letting go , or whatever the girl releases in &quot; The Ice Queen . &quot;
everywhere there is peace and simplicity .
the air in this place is so scar@@ ce that I can hardly breathe .
I can hardly believe that I breathe .
playing is the opposite of works .
and I am happy .
something in me dis@@ solves .
a mental door opens and an energy boost comes in .
and that doesn &apos;t happen immediately , but it happens .
I feel it .
the bu@@ zz is slowly coming back .
no full volume , barely there , it &apos;s quiet , barely audi@@ ble , but it &apos;s there .
not the bu@@ zz , but a bu@@ zz .
and now I feel as if I know a magical mystery .
but let &apos;s stay in the matter .
it is love . that &apos;s all .
no magic . no secret . only love .
it &apos;s something we &apos;ve forgotten .
the sums , the h@@ um , the titanium @-@ hum@@ ming , that &apos;s just the replacement .
if I ask you who you are , if I tell you who I am , if I describe myself using par@@ c@@ els and television hours and how functioning my brain is , then I forgot what the real bu@@ zz is .
the hum@@ ming is not a force and it is not labour @-@ specific .
it depends on the joy .
the real bu@@ zz depends on the love .
the bu@@ zz is the stream coming from the z@@ est of life .
true hum@@ ming is self @-@ confidence and peace .
true hum@@ ming ignor@@ es the pressure of history , the tasks to be done , expectation and pressure .
the real bu@@ zz is simple and original .
the true hum@@ ming is God &apos;s voice in my ear , but perhaps God whis@@ pered to me the wrong words , for which God told me that I am a titanium ?
it is just love .
we all need a bit more love , much more love .
as soon as my child wants to play with me , I will say yes .
I do this as a fixed rule , so that as a work@@ ah@@ olic , I can free myself from any guilt .
it &apos;s law , I have no other choice . I have no other choice if I want to hear the bu@@ zz again .
I wish it would be so easy . I &apos;m not good playing , I don &apos;t like it .
playing is not enough to me as to how to work .
the truth hur@@ ts ,
but I don &apos;t like to play it .
I always work because I love it .
I prefer to be at work as home .
this admission is painful , because what is better for a person than to be home ?
well yes , I .
hon@@ estly , I call myself &quot; Titan &quot; --
I have to have problems .
that I &apos;m too relaxed is none of it .
we race around in the garden , before and back , back and forth .
we make small dance parties ,
we sing and play ball .
we crum@@ bled soap bubbles .
I feel mostly stiff , absent and confused .
I always use my mobile phone .
but it is ok .
my children show me how to live , and the tot@@ um of the universe fills me .
I play and play until I ask myself : why did we ever stop playing ?
they can do it ! always say yes , if your child wants to play with you .
perhaps you consider me na@@ ï@@ ve , for a day@@ dre@@ amer .
you &apos;re right , but you can do it too !
you have time !
and do you know why ? they are not R@@ ih@@ anna or a Mu@@ pp@@ et Show character .
your child will find you less interesting than you think .
it is only 15 minutes .
my little ones want to play with me at the most 15 minutes , until they think they want to do something different .
it is wonderful 15 minutes , but just 15 minutes .
after 15 minutes a lad@@ y@@ bird or bis@@ cuit replaces me .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and speak my daughter to me for 15 minutes , and I am the mother of the year . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it &apos;s just 15 minutes , more it doesn &apos;t need .
each one can get up for 15 minutes , even at a bad tem@@ per day !
15 minutes a piece !
no mobile phone , no clothes , no distra@@ ction .
the day is short : dinner , the children get ready for dinner .
but 15 minutes are in it !
my children are my well @-@ being , my world . it doesn &apos;t have to be the children . it is important to feel the bu@@ zz , to have a place for peace of mind .
it &apos;s not about playing with your own children . it &apos;s about joy ,
to play the game in general .
treat yourself to the 15 minutes !
find out what you are doing well .
find out and save it .
I &apos;m not perfect in it . I fail and I won . friends meet , read books , enjoy the day --
&quot; do you want to play ? &quot; is short for everything I gave up when I got my first TV show when I became a Titan in education when I wanted to sur@@ pass myself more and more .
15 minutes a piece , why not treat yourself for 15 minutes ?
what can be wrong about it ? nothing !
the bu@@ zz@@ ing came back in my free time . the bu@@ zz@@ ing seems to return if I don &apos;t work .
working does not work without playing .
it takes time , but after a few months a door opens , the energy flows in and I find myself in my office again . I hear an unknown melody , it fills me and my soul .
I like the bu@@ zz , but I don &apos;t love it .
I don &apos;t need it .
I am not the sum , the hum@@ ming is not me ... no more .
soap bubbles and sti@@ cky fingers , dinner with friends .
that &apos;s my bu@@ zz now .
the hum@@ ming of life .
the hum@@ ming of love .
the sum of work is part of me , but just a part . and I am so grateful for that .
it is snow@@ ing me that I am a titanium . I have never seen a titanium , the journey to Jerusalem plays .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I said Yes to less work and to play more . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and yet I have everything under control . my brain is still functioning . my camp@@ fire is still burning .
the more I play , the happ@@ ier I and my children .
the more I play , the more I feel as a good mother .
the more I play , the clearer my head is .
the more I play , the better I work .
the more I play , the more I hear the sums . the country I created , the marathon , which I run , the troops , the can@@ v@@ ases , the high clay , the tot@@ um , the tot@@ um , the other , the right hum@@ ming : the tot@@ um of life .
the more I feel this sum , the more I am doing this unusual , dying , bare and new feeling of life within me . less Titan -- more I !
the more I feel this sum , the more I know who I am .
I am a writer . I think I &apos;m getting things out , I &apos;ll catch you to life .
this is part of the job , which means living his dream .
this is the dream of this job ,
for a dream job should be a little dre@@ amy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I said &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Yes &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to less work and more games . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Tit@@ ans have no chance here .
&quot; want to play ? &quot;
thank you very much .
I am a neuro@@ surgeon .
like most of my colleagues I have every day to do with human trage@@ dies .
I know how your life can change from one second to the other after a serious stroke or after a car accident .
for us neuro@@ sur@@ geons it is very frustr@@ ating that the brain , unlike other body organs , has a very low ability to self @-@ healing .
after a serious injury to the central nervous system , patients often have a permanent , severe disability .
that is probably the reason why I became functional neuro@@ surgeon .
what is a functional neuro@@ surgeon ?
a doctor who tries to improve the nerve functions by different surgical interventions .
they certainly have heard of one of the most well known , the &quot; deep brain stimulation . &quot; in doing so you im@@ itate an electrode deep in the brain to influence the circuits of the neur@@ ons in such a way that the neuro@@ logical function is improved .
it is really an amazing technology . it has improved the fate of patients with Parkinson &apos;s disease , suffering from violent trem@@ bling and severe pain .
neuro@@ mod@@ ulation , however , does not mean ne@@ uro @-@ healing .
the dream of functional neuro@@ sur@@ geons is the restoration of the brain .
in my opinion , we approach this dream .
I would like to show you that we are very close to it .
with some help the brain can help itself .
the story began 15 years ago .
at the time I was a senior doctor and worked day and night in the emergency room .
often I provided patients with skull @-@ brain trauma .
they have to imagine that the brain sw@@ ells the brain and the cran@@ ial pressure increases .
to save life , it is necessary to reduce the cran@@ ial pressure .
for this you sometimes have to remove some part s@@ wollen brain mass .
instead of throwing away the s@@ wollen brain mass , we decided to analyse the brain mass with Jean @-@ François Brun@@ et , one of my colleagues , a bi@@ ologist .
what do I mean by this ?
we wanted to let cells grow from this tissue .
this is not an easy task .
to make cells grow from one piece of tissue is comparable to very small children that are taken out of your families .
you have to find the right diet , temperature , humidity and the surroundings to thri@@ ve .
this is exactly what we had to do with these cells .
after many attempts , Jean @-@ François managed it .
he saw it under his micro@@ scope .
that was a big surprise for us .
why ?
it looked exactly like a stem cell culture . large green cells surrounded by small , un@@ ripe cells .
perhaps you still know from biology class that stem cells are im@@ mature cells that can turn into every cell type of the organism .
the adult brain has stem cells , but very few . they are hidden in deep , small ni@@ ches of the brain .
it is surprising to obtain this type of stem cells from the surface tissue of the brain mass in the surgery .
we did another fascinating observation : normal stem cells are very active -- they share very fast .
they never die , they are im@@ mortal .
but these cells beha@@ ved differently .
they split slowly and after a few weeks they even died .
so we saw a new , strange cell population , which looked like stem cells , but beha@@ ved differently .
we needed a long time to understand where they came from .
they originate from these cells .
these blue and red cells are called dou@@ bl@@ ec@@ or@@ tin @-@ positive cells .
we all have them in our brain .
they make up 4 % of our cereb@@ ral cor@@ tex cells .
they play a very important role in our development .
in the stage of the fet@@ us they care for the folding of the brain .
but why stay they get us ?
we don &apos;t know that .
we believe that they participate in the healing of the brain as we find them in higher concentrations near brain injuries .
but this is not so sure .
one thing is clear , however -- we received our stem cells from these cells .
we are facing a potential cell source that enables brain healing .
we had to prove that .
so we decided to develop an experiment .
we wanted to take a piece of brain mass out of the non @-@ linguistic area and then cultivate the cells exactly as it did Jean @-@ François .
and then mark them color in order to be able to track them in the brain .
in the last step , we re @-@ en@@ rolled them at the unloading point of the same individual .
we call the aut@@ olog@@ ous transplan@@ t -- Aut@@ otran@@ splan@@ tation .
one of our first questions was : what happens when we re @-@ implant these cells into normal brain tissue ? and what will happen when we re @-@ implant the same cells into damaged brain tissue ?
thanks to the help of Prof. Eric Rou@@ iller we were able to work with apes .
in the first scenario , we re @-@ inv@@ aded the cells into a healthy brain , and we observed that after a few weeks they disappeared completely , as if they had been removed again , they go back home . the space is already occupied , they are not needed , so they disappear .
in the second scenario we put an injury to and reim@@ pl@@ enn@@ ed exactly the same cells and now the cells remained -- they grew up to mature neur@@ ons .
here you see what we were able to observe under the micro@@ scope .
these are the cells that have been reim@@ pl@@ enn@@ ed .
the evidence they show are these small points . these are the cells we paint in vitro , in culture .
of course we could not stop here .
do these cells also help a monkey to recover from a brain injury ?
so we trained monkeys with a manual dex@@ ter@@ ity problem .
they had to take food pellets from a tray .
they made it very good .
when they reached a stable level of skill , we injured the motor skills range in the motor cor@@ tex .
as a result , the monkeys were paraly@@ sed , they could no longer move their hands .
just as it would happen in humans , they spontaneously recovered up to a certain degree , just as after a stroke .
patients are paraly@@ zed and then they try to recover with the help of plastic brain mechanisms . they recover to a certain degree , just like monkeys .
when we were sure that the monkey had reached his degree of spontaneous recovery , we im@@ planted his own cells .
on the left you see the monkey , who recovered spontaneously .
it can provide about 40 % to 50 % of its original performance from injury .
it is not so precise and not so fast .
now see when we reim@@ pl@@ ted the cells : the same monkey , two months after the rice plant@@ ation .
I can tell you that were very exciting results for us as well .
since that time , we have found a lot more about these cells .
we can freeze them and use them later .
we can use it in other neu@@ rop@@ ath@@ ological models , for example in Parkinson &apos;s disease .
but our dream is still to im@@ pe@@ de them in humans .
I really hope that I will soon show you how the human brain gives us the means to heal itself .
thank you very much .
Bruno Giuss@@ ani : J@@ oc@@ el@@ y@@ ne , that &apos;s wonderful , I &apos;m sure that just now , several dozen people in the audience , maybe even the majority , think : &quot; I know someone who can do it . &quot;
I definitely .
of course , the question is what the greatest obstacles are before you can start clinical trials in humans .
J@@ oc@@ el@@ y@@ ne Blo@@ ch : the biggest obstacles are the authorities . starting from these great results you have to fill about two kilograms of papers and forms to pass through these types of studies .
BG : this is understandable , the brain is very delicate , etc .
J@@ B : yes , but it takes a long time , a lot of patience and an almost professional team .
BG : look into the future -- you have completed the research and tried to get permission to start clinical trials . if you continue to look into the future , how many years it will take until someone can get to the hospital and this therapy will be available .
J@@ B : that &apos;s hard to say .
first , it depends on the approval of the clinical study .
will the authorities allow us to start it soon ?
then you have to carry out this study with a small group of patients .
it takes a long time to select patients to perform treatments and evaluate whether it is useful to make this kind of treatment .
then you have to apply this to a multic@@ enter study .
you first have to prove that it is useful before you can offer this treatment to anyone .
BG : and that it is safe , of course . J@@ B : of course .
BG : J@@ oc@@ el@@ y@@ ne , thank you for visiting TED and telling us about it .
BG : thank you very much .
democracy .
we in the West make a big mistake to consider them as a matter of course .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we do not see democracy as the fragile plant it is in reality but as an inventory of our society . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we tend to look at it as an imm@@ utable asset .
we believe that capitalism inevitably leads to democracy .
that is not true .
Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew from Singapore and his great im@@ it@@ ators in Beijing proved beyond doubt that it is possible to have a thri@@ ving capitalism and an impressive growth , while politics remain completely un@@ democratic .
in fact , democracy d@@ wind@@ les with us , in Europe .
at the beginning of the year when I represented Greece -- the newly elected Greek government -- was un@@ equi@@ voc@@ ally clear to me as finance minister in the Euro@@ group that the democratic process of our country -- our elections -- should not influence the austerity programs realized in Greece .
at this moment , I thought that there could be no better justification for Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew or the Communist Party of China , or some of my es@@ su@@ al friends who repeatedly said that democracy would aboli@@ sh if it would change anything .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at this point , I would like to introduce you an economic model for real democracy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I ask you , together with me , to believe that Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew , the Communist Party of China , and even the Euro@@ group are mistaken , we could save us democracy , but that we need a true and defensive democracy .
without democracy , our societies are painted , our future will ble@@ ak and our great new technologies are wa@@ sted .
on the subject of waste , I would like to point you to an interesting contradiction which currently threat@@ ens our economies .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I call it the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; twin peaks parad@@ ox . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a summit is known to you . you know and recognize him as the debt mountain that th@@ rows his long shadow over the USA , Europe and the whole world .
we all recognize the mountain of debt ,
but few recognize his twin .
a mountain of unt@@ apped cash , which belongs to the high net worth savers and corporations , but they are too anxi@@ ous to invest where it would be productive and income , with which you could wear the debt mountain and also produce all the things that humanity desper@@ ately needs , such as green energy .
I call them two numbers .
over the past 3 months , the US , UK and the euro area have been investing 3.4 tri@@ l@@ lion US dollars , in all the wealth producing goods , such as industrial plants , machines , office buildings , schools , roads , tracks , equipment and so on and so on .
3.4 tri@@ l@@ lion US dollars will sound after a lot of money , until one compar@@ es it to the 5,@@ 1 tri@@ l@@ lion US dollars , which at the same time lay around in the same countries and our financial institutions , and did absolutely nothing to infl@@ ate the stock markets and raise the real estate prices .
thus debt and un@@ productive capital form the twin peaks that do not compensate for the usual market mechanisms .
the result is stagn@@ ating wages , more than a quarter of the 25 @-@ 54 @-@ year @-@ olds in the US , Japan and Europe , and consequently a low overall economic demand , which , as in a final loop , promotes the p@@ essi@@ mis@@ m of investors who , from fear , the prophecy of the or@@ acle could be true that his son would kill him if he is grown up ,
invol@@ un@@ tarily turns the circumstances causing the pus to kill him .
this is my hatred with capitalism --
all the un@@ productive capital should be used to improve our lives , to develop human talents and to finance especially all the technologies , &quot; green &quot; technologies that are decisive for the salvation of the earth .
so is democracy the solution ?
but before we continue : what do we mean under democracy ?
Arist@@ ot@@ le defined democracy as the social form in which the free and the poor control the government .
the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy , of course , closed too many --
women , foreigners , and of course slaves .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , it would be a mistake to mi@@ tig@@ ate the significance of Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy following these exclu@@ sions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the decisive factor in the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy was and is that it with@@ drew the working poor , and not only gave them the right to freedom of expression , but more important and more crucial that they granted them the right to political co @-@ determination with the same balance of votes in matters of state interests .
the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy hasn &apos;t lasted for a long time --
like a candle that shines brigh@@ tly , it is burned out quickly .
however , our current liberal demo@@ cra@@ cies did not have their roots in ancient Athens ,
but in Mag@@ na Cart@@ a , in the glorious revolution of 16@@ 88 , even in the American constitution .
while Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy concentrated on the free citizens and strengthened the working poor , our liberal democracy is based on the values of Mag@@ na Cart@@ a , which ultimately was a statute for rulers .
for the liberal democracy came only when a complete separation of politics and economy was possible and the democratic process was restricted to politics , while the economy -- i.e. the world of corporations -- became a democracy @-@ free zone .
in today &apos;s demo@@ cra@@ cies there has been a rel@@ ent@@ less struggle between the two since the time this separation of politics and economy began , by shifting the economy slowly and dis@@ ma@@ ying it .
are you wondering why the politicians are no longer the same as before ?
it is not a degeneration of their DNA .
it is because today it is possible to be in the government and still not in power because the power is diver@@ ted from politics into the economy and the areas are separated .
I mentioned my hair with capitalism .
if you think about it , it &apos;s about like a herd of pre@@ dat@@ ors who so sustain@@ ably depl@@ ete the animals that feed them , that they are star@@ ving at the end .
similarly , it is with the economy that has so far can@@ ni@@ zed politics that it har@@ ms itself through the self @-@ caused economic crisis itself . the power of corporations grows , political goods are de@@ valued , the ine@@ quality rises , the macro@@ economic demand falls , and the directors of the corporations are too anxi@@ ous to invest the cash of their companies .
the more successful capitalism drives the &quot; demo@@ s &quot; of democracy , the higher the twin peaks , and the greater the waste of human labour power and the prosperity of humanity .
if that is true , it is obvious that we have to re@@ unite the politics and the economy , and it would be better if the &quot; demo@@ s &quot; keeps control , just as in ancient Athens , apart from the exclusion of slaves , women and foreigners .
by the way , this is not a new idea .
the Marxist left had this idea 100 years ago and it was not very good .
the doctrine of the de@@ bac@@ le of the Soviet Union should be that the working poor can only regain a position as in ancient Athens through a miracle without creating new ways of brut@@ ality and extravag@@ ance .
but there is one solution : to aboli@@ sh the working poor !
capitalism does it by replacing low @-@ wage workers with automation and robots .
the problem is , as long as economy and politics are separate areas , automation makes the twin peaks rise , the waste is more subli@@ me , and social conflicts lower , as it is - very soon , as I believe -- will come in countries like China .
so we have to transform the economy and re@@ unite the spheres of economy and politics , and ensure that we democr@@ ati@@ ze the re@@ united section , otherwise we end up in a path@@ ological surveillance hyper@@ auto@@ cracy , which lets the film &quot; matrix &quot; appear as a documentary .
the question is therefore not whether capitalism will survive the technical achievements which it has produced --
the more interesting question is whether capitalism is replaced by a d@@ yst@@ op@@ ia , similar to that in &quot; matrix , &quot; or by something similar to society in &quot; Star Tre@@ k , &quot; in which machines serve man and people indul@@ ge their energy into the exploration of the universe , or into a high @-@ tech version of the ancient Ath@@ eni@@ ans &quot; A@@ gor@@ a , &quot; in long talks the meaning of life .
I think we can be optim@@ istic .
so what would it be like to have this &quot; Star Tre@@ k &quot; -@@ like utop@@ ia instead of the &quot; matrix &quot; -@@ like d@@ yst@@ op@@ ia ?
in practical implementation , I would like to give you some examples shortly .
in the business area : please introduce a capital market in which you earn money while you work and in which your capital follows you from one work place to the next , from one company to the next , and the company -- no matter in which one is currently working -- is the property of those currently working in the company .
then all revenues come from capital and from revenues and the concept of wage labour is completely over@@ hau@@ led .
no distinction more between those who belong to the companies , but who do not work in it , and employees who work there , which the company does not belong to . no more exchange between capital and labor , no large gaps between investment and savings , and ultimately no to@@ wering twin peaks .
in the field of global political economy , please introduce briefly that our national currencies would have a freely fluctu@@ ating exchange rate , in a universal , global , digital currency , which is issued by the IMF &#91; International Monetary Fund &#93; and the G @-@ 20 &#91; Group of the 20 largest emerging countries &#93; , in the interest of all mankind .
imagine that the entire world trade is tra@@ ded in this currency -- we call it &quot; the cosmos , &quot; in units of &quot; cosmos &quot; -- and every government pays the sum equal to the trade deficit or the trade surplus of the respective country into a common fund .
imagine that this fund inv@@ ests in green technologies , especially in parts of the world where investment funds are rare .
this is not a new idea .
it is basically what John Ma@@ yn@@ ard Key@@ nes proposed at the 1944 Bret@@ ton W@@ oods Conference .
the problem was that at that time one had not the technical means to implement it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today we have them , especially against the background of a re@@ united politics and economy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the world I describe to you is simultaneously liberal , in which it fav@@ ors privileged persons , and Marxist , because it will have buried the separation of capital and labor in the tr@@ ash of history , and Key@@ nesi@@ an , global Key@@ nesi@@ an .
but above all else , it is a world in which we can imagine a real democracy .
we will awaken in such a world
or will we sink into a &quot; matrix &quot; - similar d@@ yst@@ op@@ ia ?
the answer depends on how we decide together politically .
it is in our hands and we do it better democratic .
thank you .
Bruno Giuss@@ ani : Yan@@ is ...
you describe yourself as liber@@ t@@ arian Marx@@ ists in your biography .
how relevant is Marx &apos;s analysis today ?
Yan@@ is Var@@ ou@@ fak@@ is : if anything of what I have just said is relevant , then Marx is relevant .
the reason for the re@@ unification of politics and economy is ... Do we not do this , technological development will produce such a massive decline in aggregate demand , which Lar@@ ry Sum@@ mers referred to as &quot; long @-@ term stagn@@ ation . &quot;
by transferring this crisis from one part of the Earth to the next as we are currently experiencing , it will not only dest@@ abili@@ ze our demo@@ cra@@ cies , but also the countries whose interest in liberal democracy is low .
if this analysis is true , then Marx is quite relevant ,
just like Hay@@ ek , that &apos;s why I am a liberal Marxist , and like Key@@ nes , and that &apos;s why I am completely mad .
BG : actually , and now we are .
Y@@ V : if you &apos;re not confused , you don &apos;t think about it enough .
BG : this is a very Greek , a kind of philosophical explanation -- Y@@ V : actually it was Einstein who said it . BG : in your lecture you mentioned Singapore and China and yesterday at dinner of the speakers you have said very clearly what you consider from the West &apos;s perspective on China .
would you like to repeat it here ?
Y@@ V : there is a great measure of hypo@@ cris@@ y .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in our liberal demo@@ cra@@ cies , we have the appearance of democracy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
as I said in my lecture , we have limited democracy to politics , while the area where most plays out - the sphere of economy -- is a completely democratic zone .
in a sense , if I can say so pro@@ voc@@ ative , China is today similar to the England of the 19th century .
for -- remember -- we tend to combine liber@@ alism with democracy -- this is an error , historically regarded .
liber@@ alism , Liber@@ als , as John Stu@@ art Mill --
he was particularly scep@@ tical about the democratic development .
what can be observed now in China is similar to the development we had in England during the industrial revolution , especially the transition from the first to the second .
China now repro@@ aches to do what the West has done in the nineteenth century , sm@@ ells mi@@ gh@@ tily after hypo@@ cris@@ y .
BG : I am sure that many listeners are curious about your experiences as finance ministers of Greece at the beginning of the year .
Y@@ V : I gu@@ essed that this is coming .
BG : yes ...
how do you look back six months later in the first six months ?
Y@@ V : very exciting , from a personal point of view , and very dis@@ ap@@ pointing , as we had the opportunity to start a new beginning with the euro zone ,
not only Greece , but the Eurozone ,
namely to say good@@ bye to ourselves and the perpet@@ ual den@@ ial that a massive fault line passed through the Eurozone , and continues to be progres@@ sively threatened by the development of the whole European Union .
we had the opportunity , based on the Greek proposal -- by the way , the first proposal that revealed this den@@ ial --
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; unfortunately , the powers within the euro@@ zone , within the European group , have continued to den@@ ounce the den@@ ial . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but you know what &apos;s coming .
this is the experience of the Soviet Union --
if you try to maintain an economic system that is not viable to live by political will and author@@ it@@ ari@@ anism , you may be able to delay it for a while , but when the changes occur , it happens ab@@ rup@@ tly and destructive .
BG : what changes do you fores@@ ee ?
Y@@ V : there is no doubt that the Eurozone has no future if we do not change its structure .
BG : did you make any mistakes in your time as finance minister ?
Y@@ V : every day .
BG : for example ? Y@@ V : anyone looking back -- Seri@@ ously ...
if there is a Minister of Finance , or any minister , who after 6 months in office , especially in such a ten@@ se situation , claims that he has made no mistake , then that is a dangerous person .
of course I made mistakes .
the biggest mistake was to sign the application for the extension of the debt programme at the end of February .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I believed that there was an honest interest in the len@@ ders of the len@@ ders to find a common solution . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but that was not .
they merely wanted to bring our government to a halt , just because they didn &apos;t want to deal with the distor@@ tions that ran through the euro@@ zone .
they didn &apos;t want to admit that they had been conducting a cat@@ astrop@@ hic program in Greece for 5 years .
we lost one third of our nominal GDP .
it is worse than during the &quot; Great Depression . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; none of the tro@@ ika &apos;s tro@@ ika who imposed on us this policy was : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was a col@@ os@@ sal mistake . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
BG : despite all this , and despite the aggressive sound of talks , you still seem to be pro @-@ European .
Y@@ V : absolutely .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my criticism of the European Union and the euro@@ zone comes from someone who lives and loves Europe . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my greatest fear is that the euro@@ zone does not survive . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for if they don &apos;t survive , the liber@@ ated centrifu@@ gal forces will be demon@@ ic and destroy the European Union . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this will not be disa@@ strous for Europe alone but for the entire global economy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we are probably the strongest economy in the world .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if we allow ourselves to embar@@ k on a post @-@ modern 1930 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that it appears to me , it will also be toler@@ able for the future of Europeans as well as non @-@ Europeans . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
BG : we hope that you are wrong in this point .
Yan@@ is , thank you for being at TED .
Y@@ V : thank you .
many have never heard of Roy Price , although he is probably responsible for 22 medi@@ oc@@ re minutes of your life on April 19 , 2013 .
probably also for 22 very entertaining minutes , but not for very many of you .
that goes back to the decision Roy met three years ago .
Roy Price is a senior employee at Amazon Studios ,
the TV production company from Amazon .
he is 47 years old , slim , has an icon @-@ hair@@ cut and describes himself on Twitter as &quot; Mo@@ vies , TV , Techni@@ que , Tac@@ os . &quot;
Roy has a very important job because he is responsible for selecting the shows and the content that Amazon will produce .
of course , this is a very hard @-@ fought industry .
there are already so many TV series that Roy is not able to select any one .
he has to find shows that are very , very good .
in other words , it has to find shows that are located at the very right of that curve .
this curve is the valuation distribution of more than 2500 TV series on the website IM@@ DB . the rating goes from 1 to 10 and the height shows how many shows receive this rating .
if your show is valued at nine and higher , this is a winner .
then you have a successful show .
these are shows like &quot; Break@@ ing Bad , &quot; &quot; Game of Thr@@ ones , &quot; &quot; The Wire &quot; -- all the shows that are addic@@ tive , where after watching a season , your brain asks : &quot; where are more of these episodes ? &quot;
this kind of show .
on the left side , here at this end , shows like &quot; To@@ dd@@ lers and Ti@@ ar@@ as &quot; -- -- that should tell you enough what &apos;s going on at this end of the curve .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Roy Price does not worry about getting to the left side of the corner because I think you need special intelligence to forbi@@ d &quot; To@@ dd@@ lers and Ti@@ ar@@ as . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he gets more thoughts about the middle expression , the average television -- the shows that are neither good nor bad , they simply don &apos;t inspire .
so he must make sure he &apos;s really on the right side .
the pressure is present , and of course it &apos;s the first time that Amazon is doing something , that &apos;s why Roy Price doesn &apos;t want to risk anything .
he wants to create success .
he needs guaranteed success , so he holds a contest .
he takes many ideas for TV shows and sel@@ ects eight candidates for TV shows through an evaluation , then he produces the first episode of each of these shows and places them online where they can watch them for free .
and if Amazon comes out for free things , do you still access , right ?
millions of viewers watch these episodes .
however , they do not know that they are observed when watching these shows .
they are watched by Roy and his team who record everything .
you record when you start the show when you pause , which parts one ski@@ ps or looks again .
they collect millions of data to decide which show they should produce .
in fact , they collect the data , process it , and this results in the answer , and this is : &quot; Amazon should make a sit@@ com over four Republi@@ can US sen@@ ators . &quot;
they did this show .
does anybody know the name of this show ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Alpha House &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; but it seems that not many can remember this show because it wasn &apos;t that good . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it &apos;s just an average show -- in the tru@@ est sense of the word -- because the average of this turn is 7.@@ 4 and Alpha House lands with 7.5 -- so slightly above average , but not exactly what Roy and his team worked .
about the same time at another company another manager placed a top show through data analysis . his name is T@@ ed , T@@ ed Sar@@ and@@ os , the manager for programming Net@@ fli@@ x . just like Roy he is always looking to find them a super show and he also uses data for it , but he makes it a little different .
instead of organizing a contest , he and his team looked at the available data on the Net@@ fli@@ x audience , so the ratings they give to the shows , the course of which shows they like etc .
then they use this data to find out these little details about the audience : what shows they like , which producers , which actors .
when they had all the parts together they entered a venture and decided not to make a sit@@ com via four sen@@ ators , but a drama series about a Sen@@ ator .
do you know this show ?
yes , &quot; House of Cards . &quot; Net@@ fli@@ x has landed a hit with it , at least for the first two seasons .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; House of Cards &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; gets a 9.1 rating on this curve . so exactly where they wanted to go . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
of course , the question is : what has happened here ?
it has two very competitive , data @-@ sealed companies .
they connect these many data to each other and it works great for one of them , but not for the other company .
what is this ?
because logic says somehow that this should work with everything .
if you collect millions of data for a decision you make , you should make a good decision .
it has 200 years of statistics as back @-@ up .
you optimize it with very high @-@ performance computers .
the least thing you can expect is good television , doesn &apos;t it ?
if data analysis does not work , it is a little frigh@@ tening because we live in a time where we take more and more statistics to make serious decisions , far beyond television .
does anyone know the company Multi @-@ Health Systems ?
no one . OK , that &apos;s even good .
multi @-@ Health Systems is a software company and I hope no one in this space will ever come into contact with this software . come in touch with it , you are in prison .
if anyone is in jail here in the US and asks for dis@@ miss@@ al , it is likely that the data analysis of this company is used to determine whether there is a discharge or not .
just like Amazon and Net@@ fli@@ x . but instead of deciding whether a show will be good or bad , it will be decided whether a person will be good or bad .
moderate TV , 22 minutes , that can be real bad , but even more years in prison are worse .
unfortunately , there is evidence that this data analysis , despite the many data ,
not always creating the best results . that &apos;s not because a company like Multi @-@ Health Systems does not know how to use data .
even the most experienced companies are wrong .
yes , even Google sometimes makes mistakes .
in 2009 , Google announced that it could predict breaks of flu , the bad way , through data analysis of the Google research .
it worked wonderfully and was a big news sensation . the success cul@@ min@@ ated in a publication in the journal Nature .
it worked perfectly , year by year , until it suddenly ceased to work ,
and no one could say why .
it simply did not work , this was once again a sensation , including the re@@ vocation of publication in the journal Nature .
even the most experienced companies such as Amazon and Google sometimes mis@@ understand something .
despite all these errors , data stream into decisions of life - at the workplace , in the law enforcement , in medicine .
so we should rather make sure that data is helpful .
I also know many difficulties with data . I work in computer @-@ assisted genetics -- an area where some very wise people use uni@@ mag@@ in@@ ably many data to make serious decisions , such as the decision for cancer therapy
or the development of a drug . over the years I have recognized some patterns of the difference between successful decisions based on data and not successful decisions . this pattern should be spread .
if you have to solve a complex problem , mainly do two things :
first , dis@@ assemble this problem into its components so that you can analyze the items ; as a second , put the items together again to make a decision .
sometimes you have to do this several times , but there are always two things : take apart and put together again .
and now the most important thing : data and data analysis are only good for the first part .
data and data analysis , no matter how powerful , can only help dis@@ assemble a problem and understand its parts .
they are not suitable to assemble the parts again and then come to a decision .
there is another tool for it and we all possess it : our brain .
if there is something in which the brain is good , it is necessary to re @-@ assemble parts and pieces even if the information is incomplete , in order to make a good decision -- especially if it is the brain of an expert .
that &apos;s why I think Net@@ fli@@ x was so successful because they used data and minds where they also belong in the process .
they use data to better understand their audience , which they otherwise would not have been capable of . but the decision on how to take all these parts together again and make a show like &quot; House of Cards &quot; is not in the data .
T@@ ed Sar@@ and@@ os and his team made this decision for this show , which meant that they had a big personal risk involved in this decision .
Amazon , on the other hand , did this in the wrong way .
they used data to control all their decisions , first when they were competing for TV ideas , then selecting &quot; Alpha House &quot; as a show .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was a secure decision because they could always say : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they tell us the data . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it did not lead to the desired result .
data is helpful for better decisions , but I think things go wrong when data is starting to control our decisions .
no matter how powerful they are , data is just a tool , and in order not to forget this , this device is quite useful .
many of you will ...
before there was data , this was the device for decisions .
many know it .
it &apos;s also called &quot; Magic 8 Ball . &quot; it &apos;s amazing . for decisions using a Ja@@ - or No question you just have to shake the ball to get an answer . &quot; most likely , &quot; right here at this moment .
I will try it later with a technical demo .
so far , I have made some decisions in my life , whereby I should have listened to the ball in hin@@ d@@ sight .
but , as you know , of course , if you have the data available , you would like to replace it with a little more sophisticated than data analysis to make better decisions .
but this does not change the basic structure .
in the end it &apos;s up to us to make decisions when we want to reach something extraordinary at the end of the right corner .
and I feel this as a very encouraging message that despite the large amount of data , it still pays off to make decisions , to be an expert in what you do and take risks .
because in the end , it is not the data , but the risks with which you land at the right end of the curve .
thank you very much .
