<seg id="1">This is James Risen.</seg>
<seg id="2">They might know him because he won the Pulitzer Prize as New York Times reporter.</seg>
<seg id="3">Long before anybody heard Edward Snowden, Risen wrote a book in which he published spectacularly that the NSA illegally listened to telephones of Americans.</seg>
<seg id="4">But it is another chapter that should leave a lasting impression.</seg>
<seg id="5">It describes a catastrophic US intelligence operation in which the CIA literally handed drafts to Iran for a nuclear bomb.</seg>
<seg id="6">If that sounds crazy, read it.</seg>
<seg id="7">It is an incredible story.</seg>
<seg id="8">But do you know who the chapter didn't like?</seg>
<seg id="9">The U.S. government.</seg>
<seg id="10">For almost 10 years, the government has been investigating breaches and urged him to call his alleged sources.</seg>
<seg id="11">In this turn, he became a symbol of the government's pattern of condemning whistleblowers and to spy on journalists.</seg>
<seg id="12">According to the First Constitution, the media have the right to publish secret information.</seg>
<seg id="13">But it is impossible to apply this right if media do not receive this information and if they cannot protect the identity of the courageous ones that they disclose.</seg>
<seg id="14">So when the government knocked at Risen, he did something that many courageous reporters had already done before him: he refused and said that he would rather go to prison.</seg>
<seg id="15">From 2007 to 2015, Risen lived with the risk of going to prison.</seg>
<seg id="16">But then, just days before the trial, something extraordinary happened.</seg>
<seg id="17">Suddenly, although they have been for years that it would be essential for their case, the demands of the government have been dropped to cracks.</seg>
<seg id="18">The reason: in the time of electronic surveillance, reporters and sources can hide themselves less and less.</seg>
<seg id="19">Instead of splitting and splitting cracks, they could also carry out their digital footprints for him.</seg>
<seg id="20">And so the investigators, without his consent, kept his phone in secret,</seg>
<seg id="21">Just like his e-mail data, financial and bank information, his credit, and even horsemen with the list of his flights.</seg>
<seg id="22">In the midst of this information, they found evidence that they used to condemn Jeffrey Sterling, a CIA whistleblower and Risen alleged source.</seg>
<seg id="23">Unfortunately, this is only one of many cases.</seg>
<seg id="24">President Obama promised to protect whistleblower. but instead, the judiciary condemned more than all U.S. governments in front of him.</seg>
<seg id="25">Now you can imagine how this can be a problem, especially because the government classifies too much of its work as secret.</seg>
<seg id="26">Since September 11, almost every article about national security was the result of a whistleblower went to a journalist.</seg>
<seg id="27">So we put the press work on the game, which is to be protected by the first constitutional review, because the government has more and more possibilities to spy on all.</seg>
<seg id="28">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "but just as the government allows the government to circumvent the rights of reporters, the press can also use technologies to better protect their sources." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="29">And they can do that from the moment they contact, rather than in hindsight, in the witness stand.</seg>
<seg id="30">Today there is communication software that did not exist when risking had written his book, and it is much safer than normal e-mails or phone calls.</seg>
<seg id="31">Such a technology is SecureDrop, an open-source transmission system for whistleblower, which was originally developed by the internet-famous Aaron Swartz, and is now developed by the Freedom of the Press Foundation in which I work.</seg>
<seg id="32">Instead of sending an email, go to a news site, just like the Washington Post here.</seg>
<seg id="33">There you can upload documents or send information, just as with any usual contact form.</seg>
<seg id="34">These are then encrypted and stored on a server to which only the respective news agency has access.</seg>
<seg id="35">So the government cannot obtain information secretly, and many of the information they request would not be available from the outset.</seg>
<seg id="36">However, SecureDrop is only a small part of the whole to protect press freedom in the 21st century.</seg>
<seg id="37">Unfortunately governments around the world are developing new spying technologies that endanger all of us.</seg>
<seg id="38">It is important to us to ensure that not only technology experts such as Edward Snowden have an opportunity to apply their misdeeds. it is just as important that we protect the next whistleblower,</seg>
<seg id="39">Who knows about grievances in the supply of soldiers and reports of crowded hospitals. or the next environmental employee who suggests the alarm to the contaminated water of Flint. or a wall street insider that warns us of the next financial crisis.</seg>
<seg id="40">After all, these technologies were not only made for those who want to expose crime, but to protect our all constitutional rights.</seg>
<seg id="41">Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="42">[on April 3, 2016, the biggest data leak of history has been published.] [the "Panama Papers" reveal that rich and powerful] [huge sums of money have hidden tax havens.] [what does this mean?] [we asked Robert Palmer from Global Witness for an explanation.] this week we were sent by news about a leak of 11 million documents of the Panama-based law firm Moselle Fonseca</seg>
<seg id="43">The publication of these documents gives a small insight into the secret world of tax havens.</seg>
<seg id="44">We get an impression of how customers, banks and lawyers come to companies like Moselle Fonseca and say: "okay, we need an anonymous company. can you set up that?"</seg>
<seg id="45">We actually see the emails, the exchange of messages, how the whole system works as it works.</seg>
<seg id="46">This has already led to very direct consequences.</seg>
<seg id="47">Iceland's prime minister has resigned.</seg>
<seg id="48">There are also reports that an ally of the brutal Syrian dictator Baschar al-Assad has in tax havens.</seg>
<seg id="49">It is alleged that a track of USD 2 billion leads to Russian President Vladimir Putin, a close friend of children's days, a famous cellist.</seg>
<seg id="50">Now there will be a lot of rich people out there and others waiting nervously for the next release, and on the next revealed documents.</seg>
<seg id="51">Now that sounds like the plot of an agent's agent or a John-Grisham novel.</seg>
<seg id="52">It seems to weep away from you, me, ordinary people.</seg>
<seg id="53">Why should we do that?</seg>
<seg id="54">But the truth is: if the rich and powerful are able to hide their fortunes in tax havens and not pay all their taxes, this means less money for important public services such as health care, education, roads.</seg>
<seg id="55">And this affects all of us.</seg>
<seg id="56">For my organization, Global Witness, these revelations are phenomenal.</seg>
<seg id="57">All over the world, media and leading politicians are discussing how secret tax havens are used by a few people to hide and disguise their assets -- something that we have been discussing and revealing for ten years.</seg>
<seg id="58">I think many people seem very confusing this whole world, and it is hard to understand how these tax havens work.</seg>
<seg id="59">I always imagine it like a Matrjoschkapuppe.</seg>
<seg id="60">So you have a company in another company, in another company, which makes it almost impossible to really understand who is behind these giants.</seg>
<seg id="61">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "it can be very difficult for law enforcement and tax authorities, as well as for journalists or civil society to really understand what matters." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="62">I also find it interesting that there are fewer reports on this matter in the USA.</seg>
<seg id="63">Probably because there were so far no prominent Americans who came to this scandal in these revelations.</seg>
<seg id="64">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "now it is not that there are no wealthy Americans who hide their wealth in tax havens." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="65">But by the principle of which these tax havens work, Moselle Fonseca has less American customers.</seg>
<seg id="66">If we had a data leak from the Cayman Islands or even from Delaware, Wyoming or Nevada, we would see much more cases and examples that have connections to the USA.</seg>
<seg id="67">In fact, in some US states you need less information to provide less information to create a company than to get a library card.</seg>
<seg id="68">This kind of intransparency in the US has allowed employees of school districts to rip off school children.</seg>
<seg id="69">It has allowed scammers to rip off especially susceptible depositors.</seg>
<seg id="70">It is this kind of behavior that affects all of us.</seg>
<seg id="71">Here at Global Witness we wanted to find out how all this looks in practice.</seg>
<seg id="72">How does it work?</seg>
<seg id="73">So we sent a covert investigator into the offices of 13 law firms in Manhattan.</seg>
<seg id="74">Our investigator, as an African minister, wanted to bring suspicious money to the US to buy a house, a yacht, a private jet.</seg>
<seg id="75">We really shocked that all except for a lawyer made suggestions on how he could transfer his money.</seg>
<seg id="76">None of these lawyers accepted us as clients, and of course no one was given money. but it shows the problem with this system.</seg>
<seg id="77">It is also important not to consider this as individual cases.</seg>
<seg id="78">It is not about a single lawyer who has submitted suggestions to our covert investigator.</seg>
<seg id="79">It's not about a single top politician involved in a scandal.</seg>
<seg id="80">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "it is about how the system works, through corruption, tax evasion, poverty and instability." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="81">And to cope with this, we have to change the rules of the game.</seg>
<seg id="82">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "we need to change the rules to complicate this type of behaviour." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="83">This may sound very sensical as if we could do nothing against it; as if nothing ever changed; as if there will always be the rich and powerful.</seg>
<seg id="84">But as a borrower optimist I see quite that some changes have begun.</seg>
<seg id="85">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "over the past few years we have seen more transparency regarding the owners of companies." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="86">The subject found political attention by British Prime Minister David Cameron on the G8 summit in 2013 in Northern Ireland.</seg>
<seg id="87">Since then, the EU has captured in central registers on a national level who is really behind companies in Europe and who controls them.</seg>
<seg id="88">One of the uncomfortable facts is that the US is lagging behind here.</seg>
<seg id="89">Representatives of both parties have proposed legislation in both parliamentary chambers, but this does not make the progress we would like to see.</seg>
<seg id="90">We would really like to see how these Panama revelations, this huge insight into the world of tax havens, is used as a means to ensure greater transparency in the US and globally.</seg>
<seg id="91">For us in Global Witness this is a moment for change.</seg>
<seg id="92">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "we need ordinary people who will be angry when they see how other people can hide their true identity behind headlights." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="93">"" "" "" "we need executives in the economy that stand up and say:" "" "" "" "transparency is not good for business." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="94">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "we need leading politicians who recognize the problem and commit themselves to end this kind of intransparency by laws." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="95">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "together, we can finally end the intransparency which now allows this kind of tax evasion, corruption and money laundering." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="96">This is the story of how I almost abducted and landed in the trunk of a red Mazda.</seg>
<seg id="97">One day after I finished my design studies, I made a postage sale.</seg>
<seg id="98">A guy in the red Mazda stopped and looked at my stuff.</seg>
<seg id="99">He bought one of my works of art.</seg>
<seg id="100">He was alone in the city and just made a roadtrip across the country. after that he would go to the peace corps.</seg>
<seg id="101">I invited him on a beer. he told me how he wanted to change the world.</seg>
<seg id="102">It was late. I got tired.</seg>
<seg id="103">"" "" "" "while we paid the bill, I made the mistake to ask him:" "" "" "" "where are you sleeping today?" "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="104">"" "" "" "he made the whole thing worse:" "" "" "" "I don't know yet." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="105">"" "" "" "and I thought," "" "" "" "Oh, man!" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="106">What do I do now? "</seg>
<seg id="107">Who does not know the situation?</seg>
<seg id="108">Do I have to offer a sleeping place now?</seg>
<seg id="109">But I just got to know him! he says he would go to the peace Corps, but I don't know if he really plans that. I don't want to land in the trunk of a Mazda!</seg>
<seg id="110">This is a small boot!</seg>
<seg id="111">"" "" "" "then I heard say:" "" "" "" "I have an air mattress. you can sleep in my living room." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="112">"" "" "" "a voice in my head said," "" "" "" "Alive, how please?" "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="113">At night I was lying in bed, I stared at the ceiling and thought, "Oh man! what did I rock?</seg>
<seg id="114">A wild stranger sleeps in my living room.</seg>
<seg id="115">What if he's crazy? "</seg>
<seg id="116">I got such a fear that I went out of bed, embarrassed at the door to the door, and my bedroom door closed.</seg>
<seg id="117">But he wasn't crazy at all.</seg>
<seg id="118">We are still in touch.</seg>
<seg id="119">The artwork he had bought from me hangs today in his classroom. he is now a teacher.</seg>
<seg id="120">This was my first experience as a host. it completely changed my perspective.</seg>
<seg id="121">Perhaps the people who were sold to me in childhood were actually friends who were only waiting to be discovered?</seg>
<seg id="122">To house people on my air mattress was normal for me. when I moved to San Francisco I took the air mattress.</seg>
<seg id="123">Let's take a leap, two years later...</seg>
<seg id="124">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "I am unemployed, almost broke, my roommate is pulling off and the rent is increased." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="125">I learned that at that time there was a design conference in the city. all hotels were fully booked.</seg>
<seg id="126">I think creativity can create fear of turning fear into fun.</seg>
<seg id="127">I wrote to my best friend and new roommate Brian Chesky: "Brian, I thought about how we could deserve something. our apartment becomes a designer bed and breakfast. young designers can stay with us, Wi-Fi and a desk included, with a mattress and breakfast each morning.</seg>
<seg id="128">Ha! "</seg>
<seg id="129">We created a website and founded so "air mattresses and breakfast" [AIRB and Breakfast = Airbnb].</seg>
<seg id="130">Three happy guests were allowed to sleep for 20 dollars on the air mattress on wooden floors.</seg>
<seg id="131">They found it great, and we too.</seg>
<seg id="132">I'm sure our cheese-ham-omelets tasted completely different because we made them for our guests.</seg>
<seg id="133">We toured with them throughout the city. when we said goodbye to our last guest and the door fell into the castle, Brian and I started.</seg>
<seg id="134">Had we just discovered that we could at the same time find new friends and pay our rent?</seg>
<seg id="135">Things came rolling.</seg>
<seg id="136">My former roommate, Nate Blecharczyk, joined us as a developer.</seg>
<seg id="137">We wanted to find out if we could make a business concept out of it.</seg>
<seg id="138">So we presented to investors: "we want to create a website where people publicly post images of their private rooms, their bedrooms, their bathrooms -- the kind of room whose doors are closed when visiting.</seg>
<seg id="139">Over the Internet, they can then invite wild people to stay with them.</seg>
<seg id="140">That will be the next big thing! "</seg>
<seg id="141">We were warned that the missile would ignite.</seg>
<seg id="142">But they are not.</seg>
<seg id="143">No one who is still in comfort would invest in a business that allows strangers to sleep in apartments of other people.</seg>
<seg id="144">Why?</seg>
<seg id="145">Because as children we all learned that strangers are dangerous.</seg>
<seg id="146">If you have a problem, you look at things that you can do well. we have been able to design.</seg>
<seg id="147">At the art academy we had learned that design is much more than just appearance and haptics -- it's the overall experience.</seg>
<seg id="148">We had learned how to design objects, but now we wanted to create immense confidence in design, between people who had never met before.</seg>
<seg id="149">Can design make such a thing?</seg>
<seg id="150">Is it possible to create confidence with design?</seg>
<seg id="151">I would like to give you a taste of what degree of trust we are striving for.</seg>
<seg id="152">It's a 30-second experiment. it will force you out of your comfort zone.</seg>
<seg id="153">Thumb up when you are ready.</seg>
<seg id="154">Take your mobile phone in your hand.</seg>
<seg id="155">Now I want you to unlock your mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="156">Type your locked mobile phone to your left seat neighbour.</seg>
<seg id="157">This quiet touch of panic that you feel now -- -- is exactly what hosts feel when they open the door for the first time.</seg>
<seg id="158">Because the only thing that is more personal than your mobile phone is your home.</seg>
<seg id="159">Visitors can not only read their SMS, they see your bedroom, your kitchen, your toilet.</seg>
<seg id="160">How does it feel to hold the unlocked mobile phone of a stranger in your hands?</seg>
<seg id="161">Most sense the responsibility.</seg>
<seg id="162">Most guests feel like they stay somewhere else.</seg>
<seg id="163">Only for this reason can our company exist.</seg>
<seg id="164">Just so, who actually has Al Gores mobile phone?</seg>
<seg id="165">Could you please announce on Twitter that he is channelled to the president's office?</seg>
<seg id="166">You can return the mobile phones now.</seg>
<seg id="167">You have now experienced what kind of trust we want to build up. I want to tell you about some discoveries.</seg>
<seg id="168">What if we had changed a little detail about this experiment?</seg>
<seg id="169">What if your neighbour would have imagined once with his name; if he had told where he comes from, how his dog or his children are called?</seg>
<seg id="170">Imagine you had 150 evaluations that all say: "he can really hold very well unlocked mobile phones!"</seg>
<seg id="171">How would you feel if you had to leave your mobile phone?</seg>
<seg id="172">Because a well-thought out feedback system strengthens trust decisively.</seg>
<seg id="173">In the beginning we have done some things wrong.</seg>
<seg id="174">It was hard for people to surrender negative judgements.</seg>
<seg id="175">In the end, we decided to wait until both hosts and guest left their assessments before making them online.</seg>
<seg id="176">Last week we discovered something new.</seg>
<seg id="177">We conducted a study with Stanford. we examined how likely it is that people trust each other, depending on how similar they are about age and place of residence.</seg>
<seg id="178">Little surprise we entrust most of the people who are most similar to us.</seg>
<seg id="179">The more differences we find, the less we trust.</seg>
<seg id="180">This is a natural social bias.</seg>
<seg id="181">It will be exciting when you add a person's reputation -- in our case through judgements.</seg>
<seg id="182">If you have less than three assessments, nothing changes.</seg>
<seg id="183">But if you have more than ten, everything changes.</seg>
<seg id="184">A good reputation creates similarities.</seg>
<seg id="185">The right design can help us to overcome some of our deeply rooted preferences.</seg>
<seg id="186">We also learned that trust is dependent on how much you eat of yourself.</seg>
<seg id="187">Here you can see the reactions to the first message of a guest.</seg>
<seg id="188">"" "" "" "if you tell too little, for example," "" "" "" "Hi!," "" "" "" "you won't get an answer." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="189">"" "" "" "we tell too much, for example:" "" "" "" "I have problems with my mother," "" "" "" "-- the request is not accepted." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="190">So there is an optimal degree of openness, e.g. "Great works of art in your home! I'm making a holiday with my family."</seg>
<seg id="191">How can you design it with design to make this degree of openness?</seg>
<seg id="192">We use the size of the text field to recommend the right amount of text. we also give tips on which topics to write something.</seg>
<seg id="193">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "our entire company is building up hope that the right design can help overcome our prejudices against strangers." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="194">What we did not expect was the great deal of people who were more than willing to take away these prejudices.</seg>
<seg id="195">Here you see how many people take advantage of our offer.</seg>
<seg id="196">You can see three things.</seg>
<seg id="197">First, incredibly good luck.</seg>
<seg id="198">Second, the tireless work of our team.</seg>
<seg id="199">Third: a need not previously covered.</seg>
<seg id="200">The business is very good for us.</seg>
<seg id="201">Of course there are times when not everything runs smoothly.</seg>
<seg id="202">There were guests who have not allowed parties to celebrate or devastate apartments.</seg>
<seg id="203">Hosts have allowed guests to stand in the rain.</seg>
<seg id="204">At the beginning of the project I worked in the customer service. all calls came directly to my mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="205">I stood at the front line when confidence was broken.</seg>
<seg id="206">There is nothing worse than those calls. it hurts when I just think about it.</seg>
<seg id="207">The disappointment that one hears in the voice of the callers was and will always be our greatest motivation to further improve.</seg>
<seg id="208">Fortunately, the 123 million spent overnight stays only a fraction of a problem.</seg>
<seg id="209">For people trusted one another in judgment.</seg>
<seg id="210">If trust works, miracle can occur.</seg>
<seg id="211">One of our guests made holidays in Uruguay. there he suffered a heart attack.</seg>
<seg id="212">His host drove him to the hospital.</seg>
<seg id="213">He even donated blood for the necessary surgery!</seg>
<seg id="214">Here is his judgement:</seg>
<seg id="215">"perfect house for travelers who incline to heart attacks due to sitting activities.</seg>
<seg id="216">The area is beautiful and equipped with ample hospitals.</seg>
<seg id="217">Javier and Alejandra are real guardian angels who save life even though they don't know one at all.</seg>
<seg id="218">You drive one in your own car to the hospital, when you die, and wait while you get a bypass.</seg>
<seg id="219">Because they don't want you to feel lonely, they bring books past.</seg>
<seg id="220">They let one even stay longer without calculating the extra nights.</seg>
<seg id="221">I can only recommend it! "</seg>
<seg id="222">Of course, not every stay is going on.</seg>
<seg id="223">But these relationships behind the pure money transaction are exactly what you want to achieve with the Share economy.</seg>
<seg id="224">When I stumbled across this term for the first time, I asked myself:</seg>
<seg id="225">How does the idea of sharing work with money transactions?</seg>
<seg id="226">It is a commercial trade.</seg>
<seg id="227">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "but it is not just the" "" "" "" "rental industry" "" "" "". "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="228">Share Economy describes a trade that promises human relationships.</seg>
<seg id="229">People lay a part of themselves openly, and that changes everything.</seg>
<seg id="230">If you are travelling today, fast food is to be compared. it is efficient and reliable, but less authentic.</seg>
<seg id="231">What if traveling would be a rich buffet of local impressions?</seg>
<seg id="232">What would be, if at any place you visited, a group there would be waiting to fill a thoroughly and show one in a pub trip district of which one never heard of;</seg>
<seg id="233">Or if you could learn cooking from a five-star chef?</seg>
<seg id="234">Nowadays, apartments are designed according to the principle of privacy.</seg>
<seg id="235">What if we were to create apartments from the ground up to one another?</seg>
<seg id="236">What would it look like?</seg>
<seg id="237">What if cities would accept the idea of sharing a shared part?</seg>
<seg id="238">I imagine cities that allow society and relationships rather than loneliness and isolation.</seg>
<seg id="239">This project has already begun in Seoul's capital city of Seoul. lots of parking spaces that were owned by the government,</seg>
<seg id="240">Were now offered to residents. students who were looking for a residence permit,</seg>
<seg id="241">Were taught to people whose children were moved out. incubator programs were launched,</seg>
<seg id="242">To finance new start-ups in the Share economy. over our platform alone will be 785 000 people in 191 countries to be hosted by a stranger or even host.</seg>
<seg id="243">So the idea doesn't seem to be as crazy as it was taught to us.</seg>
<seg id="244">We didn't reinvent the wheel.</seg>
<seg id="245">There was also hospitality before.</seg>
<seg id="246">There were similar websites before us.</seg>
<seg id="247">So why did our work?</seg>
<seg id="248">Apart from luck and timing, we realized that one can find the right design with the components of trust.</seg>
<seg id="249">Design can help us overcome deep-rooted prejudices.</seg>
<seg id="250">I find this amazing,</seg>
<seg id="251">Almost overwhelming.</seg>
<seg id="252">I have to think about it every time a red Mazda passes by me.</seg>
<seg id="253">We know, of course, that design cannot solve every problem.</seg>
<seg id="254">But if it could help us, if it had this great influence, I wonder why we can use design in the near future.</seg>
<seg id="255">Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="256">What do you think if you look at me?</seg>
<seg id="257">A believer? an expert?</seg>
<seg id="258">Maybe even a sister.</seg>
<seg id="259">Or oppressed, brainwashed, a terrorist?</seg>
<seg id="260">Or simply a delay during the security check at the airport.</seg>
<seg id="261">This is indeed true.</seg>
<seg id="262">I don't blame you for your negative impressions.</seg>
<seg id="263">So the media are people who look like me.</seg>
<seg id="264">A study revealed that 80% of the reporting about Islam and Muslims is negative.</seg>
<seg id="265">Studies show: Americans mean, most would not know Muslims.</seg>
<seg id="266">Probably people don't talk with their Uber drivers.</seg>
<seg id="267">For those who have never met a Muslim: it's great to get to know you.</seg>
<seg id="268">I tell you who I am.</seg>
<seg id="269">I am a mother, a coffee lover -- double espresso, with cream extra.</seg>
<seg id="270">I'm introverted,</seg>
<seg id="271">A carrot-fitness fanatic,</seg>
<seg id="272">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "and I am a practicing, spiritual Muslim." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="273">But not like Lady Gaga sings, because, baby, I was not born like that.</seg>
<seg id="274">I decided to do so.</seg>
<seg id="275">When I was 17 years old, I decided to outen me.</seg>
<seg id="276">No, not as a homosexual person, like some of my friends, but as a Muslim. I decided to wear the Hijab, my head cover.</seg>
<seg id="277">"" "" "" "my feminist friends were horrified:" "" "" "" "why do you oppress yourself?" "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="278">The funny thing was: back then it was a feminist declaration of independence for me, and in contrast to the pressure that I felt as a 17-year-old, to adapt me to a perfect and unattainable beauty ideal.</seg>
<seg id="279">I have not only passively accepted the faith of my parents.</seg>
<seg id="280">I have struggled with the Qur'an.</seg>
<seg id="281">I read it, thought, questioned, doubted and finally believed.</seg>
<seg id="282">My relationship with God was not love at first sight.</seg>
<seg id="283">She was trust and slow devotion that deepened by reading the Qur'an.</seg>
<seg id="284">The beauty of the rhythm sometimes brings me to cry.</seg>
<seg id="285">I recognize myself in it. I feel God knows me.</seg>
<seg id="286">Did you ever feel that someone perceives you, fully understands you, and yet somehow loves you?</seg>
<seg id="287">That's how it feels.</seg>
<seg id="288">Later I marries and began, like all the good Egyptians, my career as an engineer.</seg>
<seg id="289">Later, after my marriage, I had a child and basically lived the "Egyptian-American Dream."</seg>
<seg id="290">Then came that terrible morning in September 2001.</seg>
<seg id="291">Many of you probably remember exactly where they were there.</seg>
<seg id="292">I sat in my kitchen, had breakfast in the end, looked at the screen and saw the word "breaking news."</seg>
<seg id="293">There was smoke, airplanes flying into buildings, people ran out of the buildings.</seg>
<seg id="294">What was that?</seg>
<seg id="295">An accident?</seg>
<seg id="296">A technical malfunction?</seg>
<seg id="297">My shock quickly turned into indignation.</seg>
<seg id="298">Why should you do something like that?</seg>
<seg id="299">I changed the television channel and heard:... "Muslim terrorists..."... in the name of Islam... "..." Middle-Eastern origin... "..."... Jihad... "..." bombed Mecca! "</seg>
<seg id="300">Oh my God.</seg>
<seg id="301">It has not only been attacked by my country, but in the Nu the deeds of others transformed me from a citizen into a suspects.</seg>
<seg id="302">The same day we had to go through the Midwest of the USA to move to a new city and start with postgraduate studies.</seg>
<seg id="303">I remember how I felt -- when we went silent -- so deep it went into my seat, and I was the first time afraid to be recognized as a Muslim.</seg>
<seg id="304">We moved into our apartment this night, in a new city where it felt like a completely different world.</seg>
<seg id="305">And then I saw and read the warnings of the national Islamic organisations saying, "Be watchful," "Be watchful," "Be careful," "Remain in well-lit areas," "Don't be silenced."</seg>
<seg id="306">I stayed inside for the whole week.</seg>
<seg id="307">Then it was Friday that week -- the day when Muslims gather to pray.</seg>
<seg id="308">"" "" "" "and again the warnings came:" "" "" "" "do not go on this first Friday, the mosque could be a target." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="309">I looked at the extensive coverage.</seg>
<seg id="310">The feelings were understandably unfiltered and I also heard about attacks on Muslims or people that were held for Muslims.</seg>
<seg id="311">There were really surcharges on mosques.</seg>
<seg id="312">I thought: we should stay at home.</seg>
<seg id="313">But something didn't feel right.</seg>
<seg id="314">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "because the people who attacked this land have attacked our country." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="315">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "I have criticised the anger of the people on the terrorists." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="316">Imagine! I was angry too.</seg>
<seg id="317">It is not easy to constantly explain itself.</seg>
<seg id="318">I have nothing against questions, I love questions.</seg>
<seg id="319">It is the accusations that are hard.</seg>
<seg id="320">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "today we can actually hear people say:" "" "" "" "there is a problem in this country -- it is called Muslims." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="321">When will we get rid of them? "</seg>
<seg id="322">Some people want to banish Muslims and close mosques.</seg>
<seg id="323">They speak of my church like a tumor in the USA's body.</seg>
<seg id="324">Only the question arises: are we malignant or benign?</seg>
<seg id="325">They know: a malignant tumour is removed as a whole and a benign tumour is only kept under observation.</seg>
<seg id="326">The alternatives are meaningless because the question is wrong.</seg>
<seg id="327">Like all other Americans, Muslims are not a tumour in the US's body, but a vital organ.</seg>
<seg id="328">Thank you!</seg>
<seg id="329">Muslims are inventors and teachers, first responders and Olympians.</seg>
<seg id="330">Will the closure of mosques America make safer?</seg>
<seg id="331">It might release a few parking spaces, but will not stop terror.</seg>
<seg id="332">The regular visit of a mosque leads to observing people of other faiths more tolerant, and showing greater citizen participation.</seg>
<seg id="333">And as a leader of the police in the Washington area, DC recently said: people are actually not radicalised in mosques.</seg>
<seg id="334">They are radicalised in their basement or in bed in front of a computer.</seg>
<seg id="335">When it comes to the radicalisation process, it has been established that it begins online. first, the person is cut off from their community, even from their family, so that the extremist group can make a brainwashing that leads to the fact that the person believes that the terrorists are the true Muslims, and anyone who abhors their behavior and ideology is a traitor or a traitor.</seg>
<seg id="336">If we want to prevent radicalization, we have to stop people to go to the mosque.</seg>
<seg id="337">Some will still claim that Islam is a violent religion.</seg>
<seg id="338">Finally, a group like the IS establishes its brutality with the Koran.</seg>
<seg id="339">As a Muslim, as a mother, as a human, I believe that we have to do everything to stop a group like the IS.</seg>
<seg id="340">But we would add to their imagination if one recognizes them as representatives of 1.6 billion believers.</seg>
<seg id="341">Thank you!</seg>
<seg id="342">The IS has so much to do with Islam, as the Ku-Klux clan with Christianity.</seg>
<seg id="343">Both groups assert their ideology in their "Holy Book."</seg>
<seg id="344">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "but if you have a look at them, they do not drive what they read in their" Holy Scripture. "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "</seg>
<seg id="345">It is their brutality, which lets them read these things into Scripture.</seg>
<seg id="346">An outstanding Imam recently told me an amazing story:</seg>
<seg id="347">A girl came to him because she pretended to join the IS.</seg>
<seg id="348">I was really surprised and asked if she had been in contact with radical religious leaders.</seg>
<seg id="349">He said the problem was just the opposite. every priest with whom she spoke, brought her to silence and told her that her anger, her sense of injustice in the world, would only bring her into trouble.</seg>
<seg id="350">Inspired by nothing and something that would make sense to their fury, it was a major goal for the instrumentalization of extremists who promised a solution.</seg>
<seg id="351">This Imam restored the connection to God and its church.</seg>
<seg id="352">Instead of accusing them of their anger, he showed their constructive ways of real change in the world.</seg>
<seg id="353">What she learned in the mosque kept her from joining the IS.</seg>
<seg id="354">This was an insight into how Islamophobia affects me and my family.</seg>
<seg id="355">But how does it affect normal Americans?</seg>
<seg id="356">How does it affect everyone else?</seg>
<seg id="357">How does the 24-hour consumption of fear affect our democracy every day, on our freedom of thought?</seg>
<seg id="358">One study -- actually several neuroscientific studies -- show that if we fear, at least three things happen.</seg>
<seg id="359">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "we rather accept an authoritarian government system, conformity, and prejudice." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="360">One study shows that if you submit a test to test persons with negative reports about Muslims, they rather agree with military attacks on Muslim countries, as well as the circumcision of the rights of American Muslims.</seg>
<seg id="361">This is not just an academic problem.</seg>
<seg id="362">If you are looking when the mood of Muslims rise up -- between 2001 and 2013 -- this happened three times, but never in connection with terrorist attacks.</seg>
<seg id="363">It happened in the run-up to the Iraq war and during two electoral periods.</seg>
<seg id="364">So Islamophobia is not simply the natural response to Muslim terrorism as I have expected.</seg>
<seg id="365">It can actually be a tool for the manipulation of the public in order to undermine the foundation of a free society that has reasonable and well informed citizens.</seg>
<seg id="366">Dealing with Muslims is an early warning sign.</seg>
<seg id="367">We may feel it first, but the toxic air of fear harms us all.</seg>
<seg id="368">The assignment of collective guilt is not only about having to explain itself.</seg>
<seg id="369">Deah and his wife Yusor were a young married couple living in Chapel Hill, North Carolina, where both went to school.</seg>
<seg id="370">Deah was a sportsman.</seg>
<seg id="371">He was talented in the department of dental medicine, talented, promising...</seg>
<seg id="372">His sister would tell me that he was the sweetest, most generous person she knew.</seg>
<seg id="373">She visited him there and he showed her his resume. she was amazed and said:</seg>
<seg id="374">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "when is such a young man from my brotherhood?" "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="375">Just a few weeks after the visit of Suzanne with her brother and wife, her neighbor, Craig Stephen Hicks, murdered her, just like the sister of Yusor, Razan, who was visiting in the afternoon.</seg>
<seg id="376">He shot eight times on Deah.</seg>
<seg id="377">Fanaticism can be fatal, not only immoral, but also fatal.</seg>
<seg id="378">So back to the beginning.</seg>
<seg id="379">What happened after the 9 / 11?</seg>
<seg id="380">Did we go to the mosque or were we safe at home?</seg>
<seg id="381">We discussed it and for us it was not an easy decision, as it was about what America we want to leave our children: one that would control us through fear, or one in which we can freely exert our religion.</seg>
<seg id="382">We chose the mosque.</seg>
<seg id="383">With our son in the children's seat, we rode in silence, with high pressure to the mosque.</seg>
<seg id="384">I took him out, pulled out my shoes, went to the prayer hall, and what I saw let me stop.</seg>
<seg id="385">The hall was completely filled.</seg>
<seg id="386">Then the Imam made an announcement, thanked us and welcomed our guests, because half of the assemblies were Christians, Jews, Buddhists, atheists, believers and non-believers who came not to attack us, but to assist us.</seg>
<seg id="387">At that moment I collapsed.</seg>
<seg id="388">These people were there because they had preferred courage and compassion for panic and prejudice.</seg>
<seg id="389">What will you choose?</seg>
<seg id="390">What will you choose in the moment of fear and fanaticism?</seg>
<seg id="391">Will you be safe on number?</seg>
<seg id="392">Or will you join those who think that we are better than yours.</seg>
<seg id="393">Thank you very much.</seg>
<seg id="394">Thank you very much!</seg>
<seg id="395">Helen Walters: so Dalia, you seem to have hit a nerve.</seg>
<seg id="396">But I wonder what you say to those who might say that you are holding a TEDTalk, a thinker with draught, working in a noble think tank, so an exception and not the rule.</seg>
<seg id="397">What would you say to those people?</seg>
<seg id="398">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "Dalia Mogahed: I would say, don't be fooled. I am completely normal." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="399">I am no exception.</seg>
<seg id="400">My story is not unusual.</seg>
<seg id="401">I am as usual as it is allowed.</seg>
<seg id="402">When you look at Muslims all over the world, and I did this with the largest ever conducted study on Muslims all over the world, people want normal things.</seg>
<seg id="403">They want prosperity for the family, they want work and they want to live in peace.</seg>
<seg id="404">So I'm not an exception in any way.</seg>
<seg id="405">When people appear as an exception to rule, then often the rule has been broken, and they are not the exception to the rule.</seg>
<seg id="406">HW: thank you. Dalia Mogahed.</seg>
<seg id="407">What started as a platform for hobbyists is about to become a billionaire business.</seg>
<seg id="408">Control, environmental monitoring, photography, film and journalism: these are some of the possible applications for commercial drones. this is made possible in research facilities worldwide.</seg>
<seg id="409">Before air-Pakistematics arrived in our social consciousness, an autonomous fleet of flying machines in the Frac Centre in France built a six-metre-high tower of 1 500 bricks in front of the audience. some years ago they began to fly with ropes.</seg>
<seg id="410">By connecting flights, flight units reach high speed and acceleration in the smallest space.</seg>
<seg id="411">They can also build independently tension-bearing structures.</seg>
<seg id="412">They have learned to bear burdens, deal with turbulence and generally react to natural laws.</seg>
<seg id="413">Today we would like to show you a few of our new projects.</seg>
<seg id="414">Our goal is to exceed the limits of what is possible in the autonomous flight.</seg>
<seg id="415">In order for a system to operate autonomously, it must be collectively aware of where the mobile objects are located in the room.</seg>
<seg id="416">In our laboratory at the ETH Zurich we often use external cameras to find objects, which enables us to focus on the rapid development of dynamic tasks.</seg>
<seg id="417">For today's demos we use a new localization technology from Verity Studios, a branch of our laboratories.</seg>
<seg id="418">There are no external cameras.</seg>
<seg id="419">Each flight machine has internal sensors to determine the position in the room, determine calculations on board what the machine should do.</seg>
<seg id="420">There are external commands on the highest level e. g. "start" and "land."</seg>
<seg id="421">This is a so-called stern starter,</seg>
<seg id="422">A flying machine trying to hit two flies with one flap.</seg>
<seg id="423">Like other starter motor, it is efficient in forward flight, much more efficient than helicopter in all its variations.</seg>
<seg id="424">Unlike most takers, it can float, and therefore has great advantages in starting and landing, and is very versatile.</seg>
<seg id="425">However, there is always a downside.</seg>
<seg id="426">A limitation of rear-starters is that they react sensitively to turbulence such as wind gusts.</seg>
<seg id="427">We develop new controllers and algorithms to improve this.</seg>
<seg id="428">The idea behind it is that the flight machine no matter in which position the optimum position is achieved and the performance can be improved by practicing.</seg>
<seg id="429">Okay.</seg>
<seg id="430">During our research, we often ask ourselves fundamental abstract questions that penetrate the core of the matter.</seg>
<seg id="431">One such question would be: what is the smallest possible number of moving parts for controlled flights?</seg>
<seg id="432">There are practical reasons for wanting to know the answer to such a question.</seg>
<seg id="433">Helicopters are known as machines with a thousand moving parts that meet to hurt you.</seg>
<seg id="434">Decades ago trained pilots were able to fly remote-controlled aircraft, which had only two moving parts: a propeller and a stern rudder.</seg>
<seg id="435">Recently we discovered that flying with only one works.</seg>
<seg id="436">This is the monospiser, the mechanically most remote-controlled aircraft. it was invented recently.</seg>
<seg id="437">It has only one moving part, a propeller,</seg>
<seg id="438">No flaps, hinges and cross-rods, no further actuators or control surfaces, only one propeller.</seg>
<seg id="439">Although it is mechanical simple, very much happens in the inner life so that it can fly stable and move everywhere in the room.</seg>
<seg id="440">Nevertheless, it does not have the elegant algorithm of the rear-starters. to get it to fly, I have to throw it exactly right.</seg>
<seg id="441">The probability of throwing it right is low, so I'll show you a video that was filmed last night.</seg>
<seg id="442">If the Monospinner is an exercise in indulgence, this machine is here, the Omnicopter with its eight propellers, an exercise in excess.</seg>
<seg id="443">What to do with all this abundance?</seg>
<seg id="444">They see that it is diametrically symmetrical.</seg>
<seg id="445">That is why he is ambivalent in his alignment.</seg>
<seg id="446">As a result, he receives the extraordinary ability,</seg>
<seg id="447">Move in space in all directions, no matter what direction it is rotated or even how it rotates.</seg>
<seg id="448">Of course it is complex, mainly in the area of interactive rivers of the eight propellers.</seg>
<seg id="449">Some models can be represented in models, the rest is learned directly when flying.</seg>
<seg id="450">Let's look at this.</seg>
<seg id="451">When flying machines are to be part of our everyday life, they must be extremely secure and reliable.</seg>
<seg id="452">This machine consists of two separate two-propeller aircraft.</seg>
<seg id="453">This rotates clockwise</seg>
<seg id="454">And the other anti-clockwise.</seg>
<seg id="455">When you assemble them, they behave like a high-performance quadrocopter.</seg>
<seg id="456">However, if something goes wrong -- a motor or propeller falls off, the electronics or a battery -- the machine can fly further even if constrained.</seg>
<seg id="457">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "we will now demonstrate this by making a half flightless." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="458">The last demonstration uses synthetic swarms.</seg>
<seg id="459">The large number of autonomous, coordinated units allows a range of aesthetic expression.</seg>
<seg id="460">We took commercial micro-quadcopters -- each individual weighs less than one slice of bread -- and equips them with localization technology and algorithms.</seg>
<seg id="461">Each unit knows where it is and is self-controlled. that's why there is no upper limit.</seg>
<seg id="462">Hopefully these demonstrations motivate you to think about new revolutionary ideas.</seg>
<seg id="463">The very safe machine as it wants to be a flying lamp shade on Broadway.</seg>
<seg id="464">Of course, it is difficult to predict the impact of this technology.</seg>
<seg id="465">For types like us lies the wage in the development and the creative act.</seg>
<seg id="466">It serves as a reminder of how wonderful and enchanting our universe is, and that creative, wise creations are allowed to shape them in such a spectacular way.</seg>
<seg id="467">The fact that this technology has such massive commercial and economic potential is the icing on the cake.</seg>
<seg id="468">Thank you very much.</seg>
<seg id="469">1.3 billion years ago, two black holes circled each other in a very far distant galaxy. they turned the mass of three suns into pure energy in a tenth of a second.</seg>
<seg id="470">For this short moment, they lit up brighter than all the stars together in all the galaxies of the entire universe known to us.</seg>
<seg id="471">It was a very big bang.</seg>
<seg id="472">But they did not release their energy in the form of light --</seg>
<seg id="473">We finally talk about black holes.</seg>
<seg id="474">The whole energy was released into space-time-structure itself and the universe exploded into gravitational-waves.</seg>
<seg id="475">Let us first arrange the events temporally.</seg>
<seg id="476">1.3 billion years ago, it was just multi-cell life on Earth.</seg>
<seg id="477">Since then the earth has brought forth a lot: corals, fish, plants, dinosaurs, humans and -- God is on us -- even the internet.</seg>
<seg id="478">About 25 years ago, a group of specially courageous -- Rai Weiss from MIT, Kip Thorne and Ronald Drever from Caltech -- decided to build a huge laser detector to search for gravitational-waves, which occur approximately by collozing black holes.</seg>
<seg id="479">Most of them thought they were crazy.</seg>
<seg id="480">But enough people recognized them as crazy geniuses, so the US National Science Foundation financed its idea.</seg>
<seg id="481">After decades of development, construction, conception and extremely hard work they built the Detector Ligo: the laser interferometer- gravitational wave Observatory.</seg>
<seg id="482">In the follow-up period, the precision of ligo could be significantly increased, resulting in an enormous improvement in recognition performance.</seg>
<seg id="483">Therefore it is called Advanced Ligo.</seg>
<seg id="484">At the beginning of September 2015, Ligo was launched for a final test run to clarify some minor, stubborn problems.</seg>
<seg id="485">On 14 September 2015, only a few days after the start-up of the detector, the gravitational-waves of the two colliding black holes rocked through the earth.</seg>
<seg id="486">They went through you and me</seg>
<seg id="487">And also through the detector.</seg>
<seg id="488">Scott Hughes: only two moments in my life were more emotional than this:</seg>
<seg id="489">The birth of my daughter</seg>
<seg id="490">And the farewell from my sick father.</seg>
<seg id="491">In essence, these were the fruits of my life.</seg>
<seg id="492">All that I had worked for is no longer science fiction! AA: this is my very good friend and colleague Scott Hughes, theoretical physicist at MIT. he has been studying gravitational-waves from black holes and her through observatories like ligo measurable signals. but what are gravitational-waves?</seg>
<seg id="493">A wave of gravity is a crow in the fabric of space and time.</seg>
<seg id="494">When moving the shaft, the space and its entire content are stretched in one direction and stripped into the other.</seg>
<seg id="495">For illustration, lecturers in courses on relativity theory often perform a truly alpine dance.</seg>
<seg id="496">"stretching and dusting, stretching and dusting."</seg>
<seg id="497">The problem is that gravitational-waves are extremely weak, even ridiculous.</seg>
<seg id="498">On September 14th, for example, each of us was stretched and stowed by us when the waves were hit. the elongation of an average man was 10 high -21.</seg>
<seg id="499">That is 20 zeros after the comma, followed by a 1st Therefore, the Ligo employees declared crazy.</seg>
<seg id="500">With a five-kilometre laser detector, and this is already absurd, this length would have to be measured in less than one thousandth of the radius of an atomic nucleus. that's grotesque.</seg>
<seg id="501">At the end of his classical text about gravitation</seg>
<seg id="502">Description Kip Thorne, a co-founder of Ligos, described the waves as follows: "the technical difficulties in the construction of such detectors are enormous.</seg>
<seg id="503">"" "" "" "but physicists are inventive and with the support of the public all obstacles will be overcome." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="504">Thorne published this 1973, 42 years before his success.</seg>
<seg id="505">Back to Ligo. Scott claims to be more an ear than an eye.</seg>
<seg id="506">I would like to explain what this means.</seg>
<seg id="507">Visible light has a wavelength, which is much smaller than the things around us: facial features, the size of your cell.</seg>
<seg id="508">This is quite practical, as you can make a picture or map of things by listening to the light coming from several points around you.</seg>
<seg id="509">With sounds it's different.</seg>
<seg id="510">Audible sounds have a wavelength of up to 15 meters.</seg>
<seg id="511">That is why it is very difficult, actually impossible to produce a picture of things that will mean a lot to you:</seg>
<seg id="512">About the face of your child.</seg>
<seg id="513">Instead we listen to certain characteristics such as pitch and pitch, rhythm and volume to close the story behind it.</seg>
<seg id="514">"now, Alice is talking."</seg>
<seg id="515">"and Bob is interrupting them."</seg>
<seg id="516">"dummer Bob."</seg>
<seg id="517">The same applies to gravitational-waves.</seg>
<seg id="518">With them we cannot make simple pictures of objects in space.</seg>
<seg id="519">But by paying attention to changes in the amplitude and frequency of the waves, we can listen to their stories.</seg>
<seg id="520">At least for Ligo, the measured frequencies are in the audible range.</seg>
<seg id="521">So when we convert wave patterns into sound, we can literally hear the universe speak.</seg>
<seg id="522">The gravitation to listen can tell us about the collision of two black holes, with which my colleague Scott has been busy for a very long time.</seg>
<seg id="523">SH: two black, non-rotating holes, chirp easy: wupp!</seg>
<seg id="524">Turn the two bodies very quickly, you can hear the same chirp with an additional sound change. that sounds like: Wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu!</seg>
<seg id="525">It is a kind of movement vocabulary, imprinted in the waveform.</seg>
<seg id="526">AA: on September 14, 2015 -- a date that I will never forget -- Ligo heard the following: [surrendering noise] somebody who knows what he has to hear will recognize this as sound of -- SH:... two black holes each with 30-fold solar mass, which turn around as fast as the rods of your mixer.</seg>
<seg id="527">AA: let's think about what this means.</seg>
<seg id="528">Two black holes, the densest body in space, one with a mass of 29 suns, the other with a mass of 36 suns, circle each hundred times a second before they collide.</seg>
<seg id="529">Imagine these forces.</seg>
<seg id="530">Fantastic.</seg>
<seg id="531">And we know because we've heard it.</seg>
<seg id="532">There is the lasting significance of Ligo.</seg>
<seg id="533">Ligo paves a completely new way to research the universe as it has never been possible before.</seg>
<seg id="534">On this way we can listen to the universe and hear the invisible.</seg>
<seg id="535">Much in space, we can't see -- practically or basically -- not.</seg>
<seg id="536">A supernova, for example. I would like to know why masserolean stars explode in super novas.</seg>
<seg id="537">They are very useful. from them we have learned a lot about the universe.</seg>
<seg id="538">But the exciting physical processes happen in the nucleus that lies behind thousands of kilometers of iron, carbon and silicon.</seg>
<seg id="539">We will never see through as these are opaque.</seg>
<seg id="540">The Big Bang: I would like to explore the first minutes of the universe, but we will never see them as the Big Bang is covered by its own afterglow.</seg>
<seg id="541">Using gravity shafts it should be possible to look back to the beginning.</seg>
<seg id="542">And the most important thing: I am optimistic that there exist in all things that we have never seen before, which we will never see and of which we have no idea. things we only discover by listening.</seg>
<seg id="543">In fact, in the first attempt, Ligo found things that we had not expected.</seg>
<seg id="544">My colleague at MIT, Matt Evans, an important member of the Ligo project, says on this subject: me: the kind of stars that produce black holes, as Ligo watches them, are the dinosaurs of the universe.</seg>
<seg id="545">They are enormous, ancient bodies of prehistoric times. the black holes are, so to speak, the Saurierknochen for our archaeological work.</seg>
<seg id="546">Ligo allows us a completely different point of view of the happenings in space, the emergence of the stars and ultimately also on how we emerged from this chaos.</seg>
<seg id="547">AA: the challenge is to be as courageous as possible.</seg>
<seg id="548">Thanks to Ligo, we know how to build great detectors and listen to the noise and chirping of the cosmos.</seg>
<seg id="549">We need ideas for new observatories - a whole new generation of observatories on earth and in space.</seg>
<seg id="550">For what could be nicer than to listen to the Big Bang?</seg>
<seg id="551">Now is the time of great dreams.</seg>
<seg id="552">Dream with us.</seg>
<seg id="553">Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="554">Some time ago, I experimented with an experiment.</seg>
<seg id="555">"" "" "" "for a year I would say" "" "" "" "Yes!" "" "" "" "before I was afraid." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="556">No matter if it made me nervous, brought me into unpleasant situations, I forced myself to say "Yes."</seg>
<seg id="557">Did I want to speak to the public?</seg>
<seg id="558">No, but yes!</seg>
<seg id="559">Did I want to be live on TV?</seg>
<seg id="560">No, but yes!</seg>
<seg id="561">Did I want to start with the show?</seg>
<seg id="562">No, no, no, yes, yes, yes.</seg>
<seg id="563">And a crazy thing happened: doing just that, what I was afraid of, removed my fear.</seg>
<seg id="564">My fear of keeping speeches, my social anxiety -- puff, gone.</seg>
<seg id="565">The power of a word is impressive.</seg>
<seg id="566">"yes," my life has changed.</seg>
<seg id="567">"yes," changed me.</seg>
<seg id="568">But there was a certain Yes that changed my life deeply into an unexpected way. it started with a question of my little ones.</seg>
<seg id="569">"" "" "" "I have three incredible daughters, Harper, Beckett and Emerson. and Emerson, the smallest, calls all" "" "" "" "kitten" "" "" "" "for inexplicable reasons." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="570">As if she were a waitress from the south.</seg>
<seg id="571">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "kitten, I need milk for my bill." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="572">She asked me if I could play with her when I was on the go. and I said, "Yes."</seg>
<seg id="573">This Yes was the Beginning</seg>
<seg id="574">A new attitude towards life in my family. from then on I swear to always play with them as soon as you ask me to do so. no matter what I'm doing, or where I go, I always say yes -- every single time.</seg>
<seg id="575">Almost. I'm not perfect, but I am very tired.</seg>
<seg id="576">It has a magical effect on me, my children, to our family.</seg>
<seg id="577">But it also has an amazing side effect: only recently I fully understood that the "yes" thing to play with my children saved my career.</seg>
<seg id="578">I have a real dream job.</seg>
<seg id="579">I am a writer. I think I'm doing things, catch you to life.</seg>
<seg id="580">Dream job.</seg>
<seg id="581">No. no.</seg>
<seg id="582">I am a Titan.</seg>
<seg id="583">Dream job.</seg>
<seg id="584">I create television. I produce television.</seg>
<seg id="585">I'm doing TV, in a grand style.</seg>
<seg id="586">In this TV season I am responsible for carrying out 70 hours of program into the world.</seg>
<seg id="587">Four TV programs, 70 hours of television. three to four shows are simultaneously in production.</seg>
<seg id="588">Each shipment has hundreds of jobs that did not exist before.</seg>
<seg id="589">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "the budget for an episode of a television station can lie between three and six million dollars." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="590">Let's say five.</seg>
<seg id="591">A new episode every nine days four shows, so every nine days 20 million dollars TV, four TV programs, 70 hours TV, three broadcasts simultaneously in production four, 16 episodes at the same time: 24 episodes: grey's, 21 episodes: how To Get Away With Murder, 10 episodes: the Catch, 70 hours television,</seg>
<seg id="592">350 million dollars for one season.</seg>
<seg id="593">In America, my TV series runs one after the other on Thursday evening.</seg>
<seg id="594">All over the world, my series runs in 256 regions in 67 languages for 30 million viewers.</seg>
<seg id="595">My brain is global, and 45 of these 70 TV hours are broadcasts I created myself and not only produced, so above. I have to find time, really quiet, creative time to gather my fans around the campfire and tell my stories.</seg>
<seg id="596">Four TV series, 70 hours of television, three, sometimes four, shows at the same time in production, 350 million dollars, bonfires burning around the world.</seg>
<seg id="597">Do you know who else is doing it?</seg>
<seg id="598">No one, therefore I am a Titan.</seg>
<seg id="599">Dream job.</seg>
<seg id="600">I don't want to impress you.</seg>
<seg id="601">I say it because I know what you think when the word "author" falls.</seg>
<seg id="602">I tell you, that all of you who work so hard whether you are managing a company, a country or a classroom, a business or a household, take me seriously when I speak of work, so that you understand that I am not only sitting around on the computer and fanciful, and it is true when I say: I understand that there is no dream about a dream job.</seg>
<seg id="603">It's all a job, all work, all reality, everything blood, all perspiration -- no tears.</seg>
<seg id="604">I work a lot, hard and I love it.</seg>
<seg id="605">When I'm deepened into work, there is no other feeling.</seg>
<seg id="606">My work always creates a country out of nowhere.</seg>
<seg id="607">It is as if I stood up troops when I painted on a canvas.</seg>
<seg id="608">As you can see a high sound, run a marathon.</seg>
<seg id="609">One feels like Beyoncé.</seg>
<seg id="610">And all at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="611">I love to work.</seg>
<seg id="612">It is creative, mechanical, tiring and intoxicating, funny and disturbing, clinically and maternal, cruel and sensible. and the best of it is the buzz.</seg>
<seg id="613">There is such a change in me when the work goes well.</seg>
<seg id="614">A buzz starts in my head, and it grows and grows, and the buzz sounds like a busy road, I could go on it forever.</seg>
<seg id="615">Many people accept when I explain to them the sums that I talk about writing that writing gives me joy.</seg>
<seg id="616">Don't understand me wrong, it does.</seg>
<seg id="617">But the buzz -- when I began to work and work and work, build, create and work together, I discovered this thing, this sum, this energy. the buzz!</seg>
<seg id="618">The buzz is more than writing.</seg>
<seg id="619">The totum is action and activity. the buzz is a drug.</seg>
<seg id="620">The buzz is music. the buzz is light and air.</seg>
<seg id="621">The humming is God's voice in my ear.</seg>
<seg id="622">And if you have such a buzz, then you can't strive to be different from size.</seg>
<seg id="623">The feeling of not being able to be different than aspiring to size doesn't matter what price.</seg>
<seg id="624">This is called the sums.</seg>
<seg id="625">Or perhaps it also means to be a workaholic.</seg>
<seg id="626">Maybe it's called Genie.</seg>
<seg id="627">Maybe it's called ego.</seg>
<seg id="628">Perhaps it is the fear of failure.</seg>
<seg id="629">I don't know.</seg>
<seg id="630">I only know that I am not done for failure, and I only know that I love humming.</seg>
<seg id="631">I just want to tell you, I am a Titan, and I know I don't want to question it.</seg>
<seg id="632">In order to make one clear: the more successful I become, the more broadcasts, the more crossroads, the more work there is, the more things I write, the more I write history, the more I write.</seg>
<seg id="633">The more I work to be successful, the more I have to work.</seg>
<seg id="634">And what did I say about work?</seg>
<seg id="635">I love work, isn't it?</seg>
<seg id="636">The country I created, the marathon I run, the army, the screen, the high sound, the totum, the totum, the totum.</seg>
<seg id="637">I like this sum. I love the buzz.</seg>
<seg id="638">I need the sum. I am the sum.</seg>
<seg id="639">Am I only this sum?</seg>
<seg id="640">And then the buzzing stopped.</seg>
<seg id="641">Overhauled, overloaded, exaggerated, burned out.</seg>
<seg id="642">The buzzing stopped.</seg>
<seg id="643">Now my three daughters are used to the truth that their mommy is a single working title.</seg>
<seg id="644">Harper tells people: "my mom won't be there but you can write my nanny."</seg>
<seg id="645">"" "" "" "and Emerson says," "" "" "" "Surely I want to go to Shonda-Land." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="646">It is the children of a Titans.</seg>
<seg id="647">They are baby titans.</seg>
<seg id="648">They were 12, 3 and 1 when the totum ceased.</seg>
<seg id="649">The buzzing of the engine was silent.</seg>
<seg id="650">I didn't love my work any more. the engine was out.</seg>
<seg id="651">The buzzing did not come back.</seg>
<seg id="652">My buzz was broken.</seg>
<seg id="653">I did the same things as always: the same Titans work, 15 hours days, worked out weekends, no regret, nothing delegating, a titanium does not sleep, doesn't give up, with all my heart, clear eyes, whatever.</seg>
<seg id="654">But there was no totem.</seg>
<seg id="655">In me was silence.</seg>
<seg id="656">Four TV programs, 70 hours, three productions at the same time, sometimes four.</seg>
<seg id="657">Four TV programs, 70 hours, three productions at the same time...</seg>
<seg id="658">I was the perfect titanium.</seg>
<seg id="659">I was a show Titan,</seg>
<seg id="660">Everything was grey, I just couldn't have fun anymore.</seg>
<seg id="661">And that was my life.</seg>
<seg id="662">Everything I did.</seg>
<seg id="663">I was the sum and the buzz I was.</seg>
<seg id="664">So what do you do if what you do, the work you love suddenly fade away?</seg>
<seg id="665">"" "" "" "I know some may think:" "" "" "" "grasps you, stupid author-Titan." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="666">But you know you do it, you do, you love what you are doing, being a teacher, a banker, a mother, a painter, Bill Gates, you just love another and that gives you the buzz when you know the buzz when the buzz stops, who is you then?</seg>
<seg id="667">What are you?</seg>
<seg id="668">What am I?</seg>
<seg id="669">Am I still a Titan?</seg>
<seg id="670">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "when the song of my heart is listening, I can survive in silence?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="671">"" "" "" "and then my" "" "" "" "southern state waitress" "" "" "" "asks me a question." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="672">"" "" "" "I am on the way out, late, and she says," "" "" "" "Mama, can you play?" "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="673">And I want to say no, when two things become aware of me:</seg>
<seg id="674">First, I must say Yes to everything and secondly, she didn't call me "kitten."</seg>
<seg id="675">She doesn't call anybody more "kitten."</seg>
<seg id="676">When is this happening?</seg>
<seg id="677">I miss it when I'm Titan and get my buzz, and here everything changes in front of my own eyes.</seg>
<seg id="678">"" "" "" "and so she says," "" "" "" "Mama, can you play?" "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="679">And I say, "Yes."</seg>
<seg id="680">There is nothing special about it.</seg>
<seg id="681">We play and her sisters come across, we laugh a lot and I read quite dramatically from the book "Everybody Poops."</seg>
<seg id="682">Nothing extraordinary.</seg>
<seg id="683">But it's outstanding because my pain and panic, loneliness and lack of money, I can't do anything except to watch out.</seg>
<seg id="684">I am focused.</seg>
<seg id="685">I am quiet.</seg>
<seg id="686">The country I created, the marathon I run, the army, the screen, the high sound - they no longer exist.</seg>
<seg id="687">All that exists are sticky fingers and wet kisses, delicate voices, wax scents and the song in which it is letting go, or whatever the girl releases in "The Ice Queen."</seg>
<seg id="688">Everywhere there is peace and simplicity.</seg>
<seg id="689">The air in this place is so scarce that I can hardly breathe.</seg>
<seg id="690">I can hardly believe that I breathe.</seg>
<seg id="691">Playing is the opposite of works.</seg>
<seg id="692">And I am happy.</seg>
<seg id="693">Something in me dissolves.</seg>
<seg id="694">A mental door opens and an energy boost comes in.</seg>
<seg id="695">And that doesn't happen immediately, but it happens.</seg>
<seg id="696">I feel it.</seg>
<seg id="697">The buzz is slowly coming back.</seg>
<seg id="698">No full volume, barely there, it's quiet, barely audible, but it's there.</seg>
<seg id="699">Not the buzz, but a buzz.</seg>
<seg id="700">And now I feel as if I know a magical mystery.</seg>
<seg id="701">But let's stay in the matter.</seg>
<seg id="702">It is love. that's all.</seg>
<seg id="703">No magic. no secret. only love.</seg>
<seg id="704">It's something we've forgotten.</seg>
<seg id="705">The sums, the hum, the titanium-humming, that's just the replacement.</seg>
<seg id="706">If I ask you who you are, if I tell you who I am, if I describe myself using parcels and television hours and how functioning my brain is, then I forgot what the real buzz is.</seg>
<seg id="707">The humming is not a force and it is not labour-specific.</seg>
<seg id="708">It depends on the joy.</seg>
<seg id="709">The real buzz depends on the love.</seg>
<seg id="710">The buzz is the stream coming from the zest of life.</seg>
<seg id="711">True humming is self-confidence and peace.</seg>
<seg id="712">True humming ignores the pressure of history, the tasks to be done, expectation and pressure.</seg>
<seg id="713">The real buzz is simple and original.</seg>
<seg id="714">The true humming is God's voice in my ear, but perhaps God whispered to me the wrong words, for which God told me that I am a titanium?</seg>
<seg id="715">It is just love.</seg>
<seg id="716">We all need a bit more love, much more love.</seg>
<seg id="717">As soon as my child wants to play with me, I will say yes.</seg>
<seg id="718">I do this as a fixed rule, so that as a workaholic, I can free myself from any guilt.</seg>
<seg id="719">It's law, I have no other choice. I have no other choice if I want to hear the buzz again.</seg>
<seg id="720">I wish it would be so easy. I'm not good playing, I don't like it.</seg>
<seg id="721">Playing is not enough to me as to how to work.</seg>
<seg id="722">The truth hurts,</seg>
<seg id="723">But I don't like to play it.</seg>
<seg id="724">I always work because I love it.</seg>
<seg id="725">I prefer to be at work as home.</seg>
<seg id="726">This admission is painful, because what is better for a person than to be home?</seg>
<seg id="727">Well yes, I.</seg>
<seg id="728">Honestly, I call myself "Titan" --</seg>
<seg id="729">I have to have problems.</seg>
<seg id="730">That I'm too relaxed is none of it.</seg>
<seg id="731">We race around in the garden, before and back, back and forth.</seg>
<seg id="732">We make small dance parties,</seg>
<seg id="733">We sing and play ball.</seg>
<seg id="734">We crumbled soap bubbles.</seg>
<seg id="735">I feel mostly stiff, absent and confused.</seg>
<seg id="736">I always use my mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="737">But it is ok.</seg>
<seg id="738">My children show me how to live, and the totum of the universe fills me.</seg>
<seg id="739">I play and play until I ask myself: why did we ever stop playing?</seg>
<seg id="740">They can do it! always say yes, if your child wants to play with you.</seg>
<seg id="741">Perhaps you consider me naïve, for a daydreamer.</seg>
<seg id="742">You're right, but you can do it too!</seg>
<seg id="743">You have time!</seg>
<seg id="744">And do you know why? they are not Rihanna or a Muppet Show character.</seg>
<seg id="745">Your child will find you less interesting than you think.</seg>
<seg id="746">It is only 15 minutes.</seg>
<seg id="747">My little ones want to play with me at the most 15 minutes, until they think they want to do something different.</seg>
<seg id="748">It is wonderful 15 minutes, but just 15 minutes.</seg>
<seg id="749">After 15 minutes a ladybird or biscuit replaces me.</seg>
<seg id="750">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "and speak my daughter to me for 15 minutes, and I am the mother of the year." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="751">It's just 15 minutes, more it doesn't need.</seg>
<seg id="752">Each one can get up for 15 minutes, even at a bad temper day!</seg>
<seg id="753">15 minutes a piece!</seg>
<seg id="754">No mobile phone, no clothes, no distraction.</seg>
<seg id="755">The day is short: dinner, the children get ready for dinner.</seg>
<seg id="756">But 15 minutes are in it!</seg>
<seg id="757">My children are my well-being, my world. it doesn't have to be the children. it is important to feel the buzz, to have a place for peace of mind.</seg>
<seg id="758">It's not about playing with your own children. it's about joy,</seg>
<seg id="759">To play the game in general.</seg>
<seg id="760">Treat yourself to the 15 minutes!</seg>
<seg id="761">Find out what you are doing well.</seg>
<seg id="762">Find out and save it.</seg>
<seg id="763">I'm not perfect in it. I fail and I won. friends meet, read books, enjoy the day --</seg>
<seg id="764">"do you want to play?" is short for everything I gave up when I got my first TV show when I became a Titan in education when I wanted to surpass myself more and more.</seg>
<seg id="765">15 minutes a piece, why not treat yourself for 15 minutes?</seg>
<seg id="766">What can be wrong about it? nothing!</seg>
<seg id="767">The buzzing came back in my free time. the buzzing seems to return if I don't work.</seg>
<seg id="768">Working does not work without playing.</seg>
<seg id="769">It takes time, but after a few months a door opens, the energy flows in and I find myself in my office again. I hear an unknown melody, it fills me and my soul.</seg>
<seg id="770">I like the buzz, but I don't love it.</seg>
<seg id="771">I don't need it.</seg>
<seg id="772">I am not the sum, the humming is not me... no more.</seg>
<seg id="773">Soap bubbles and sticky fingers, dinner with friends.</seg>
<seg id="774">That's my buzz now.</seg>
<seg id="775">The humming of life.</seg>
<seg id="776">The humming of love.</seg>
<seg id="777">The sum of work is part of me, but just a part. and I am so grateful for that.</seg>
<seg id="778">It is snowing me that I am a titanium. I have never seen a titanium, the journey to Jerusalem plays.</seg>
<seg id="779">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "I said Yes to less work and to play more." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="780">And yet I have everything under control. my brain is still functioning. my campfire is still burning.</seg>
<seg id="781">The more I play, the happier I and my children.</seg>
<seg id="782">The more I play, the more I feel as a good mother.</seg>
<seg id="783">The more I play, the clearer my head is.</seg>
<seg id="784">The more I play, the better I work.</seg>
<seg id="785">The more I play, the more I hear the sums. the country I created, the marathon, which I run, the troops, the canvases, the high clay, the totum, the totum, the other, the right humming: the totum of life.</seg>
<seg id="786">The more I feel this sum, the more I am doing this unusual, dying, bare and new feeling of life within me. less Titan -- more I!</seg>
<seg id="787">The more I feel this sum, the more I know who I am.</seg>
<seg id="788">I am a writer. I think I'm getting things out, I'll catch you to life.</seg>
<seg id="789">This is part of the job, which means living his dream.</seg>

<seg id="793">Titans have no chance here.</seg>
<seg id="794">"want to play?"</seg>
<seg id="795">Thank you very much.</seg>
<seg id="796">I am a neurosurgeon.</seg>
<seg id="797">Like most of my colleagues I have every day to do with human tragedies.</seg>
<seg id="798">I know how your life can change from one second to the other after a serious stroke or after a car accident.</seg>
<seg id="799">For us neurosurgeons it is very frustrating that the brain, unlike other body organs, has a very low ability to self-healing.</seg>
<seg id="800">After a serious injury to the central nervous system, patients often have a permanent, severe disability.</seg>
<seg id="801">That is probably the reason why I became functional neurosurgeon.</seg>
<seg id="802">What is a functional neurosurgeon?</seg>
<seg id="803">A doctor who tries to improve the nerve functions by different surgical interventions.</seg>
<seg id="804">They certainly have heard of one of the most well known, the "deep brain stimulation." in doing so you imitate an electrode deep in the brain to influence the circuits of the neurons in such a way that the neurological function is improved.</seg>
<seg id="805">It is really an amazing technology. it has improved the fate of patients with Parkinson's disease, suffering from violent trembling and severe pain.</seg>
<seg id="806">Neuromodulation, however, does not mean neuro-healing.</seg>
<seg id="807">The dream of functional neurosurgeons is the restoration of the brain.</seg>
<seg id="808">In my opinion, we approach this dream.</seg>
<seg id="809">I would like to show you that we are very close to it.</seg>
<seg id="810">With some help the brain can help itself.</seg>
<seg id="811">The story began 15 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="812">At the time I was a senior doctor and worked day and night in the emergency room.</seg>
<seg id="813">Often I provided patients with skull-brain trauma.</seg>
<seg id="814">They have to imagine that the brain swells the brain and the cranial pressure increases.</seg>
<seg id="815">To save life, it is necessary to reduce the cranial pressure.</seg>
<seg id="816">For this you sometimes have to remove some part swollen brain mass.</seg>
<seg id="817">Instead of throwing away the swollen brain mass, we decided to analyse the brain mass with Jean-François Brunet, one of my colleagues, a biologist.</seg>
<seg id="818">What do I mean by this?</seg>
<seg id="819">We wanted to let cells grow from this tissue.</seg>
<seg id="820">This is not an easy task.</seg>
<seg id="821">To make cells grow from one piece of tissue is comparable to very small children that are taken out of your families.</seg>
<seg id="822">You have to find the right diet, temperature, humidity and the surroundings to thrive.</seg>
<seg id="823">This is exactly what we had to do with these cells.</seg>
<seg id="824">After many attempts, Jean-François managed it.</seg>
<seg id="825">He saw it under his microscope.</seg>
<seg id="826">That was a big surprise for us.</seg>
<seg id="827">Why?</seg>
<seg id="828">It looked exactly like a stem cell culture. large green cells surrounded by small, unripe cells.</seg>
<seg id="829">Perhaps you still know from biology class that stem cells are immature cells that can turn into every cell type of the organism.</seg>
<seg id="830">The adult brain has stem cells, but very few. they are hidden in deep, small niches of the brain.</seg>
<seg id="831">It is surprising to obtain this type of stem cells from the surface tissue of the brain mass in the surgery.</seg>
<seg id="832">We did another fascinating observation: normal stem cells are very active -- they share very fast.</seg>
<seg id="833">They never die, they are immortal.</seg>
<seg id="834">But these cells behaved differently.</seg>
<seg id="835">They split slowly and after a few weeks they even died.</seg>
<seg id="836">So we saw a new, strange cell population, which looked like stem cells, but behaved differently.</seg>
<seg id="837">We needed a long time to understand where they came from.</seg>
<seg id="838">They originate from these cells.</seg>
<seg id="839">These blue and red cells are called doublecortin-positive cells.</seg>
<seg id="840">We all have them in our brain.</seg>
<seg id="841">They make up 4% of our cerebral cortex cells.</seg>
<seg id="842">They play a very important role in our development.</seg>
<seg id="843">In the stage of the fetus they care for the folding of the brain.</seg>
<seg id="844">But why stay they get us?</seg>
<seg id="845">We don't know that.</seg>
<seg id="846">We believe that they participate in the healing of the brain as we find them in higher concentrations near brain injuries.</seg>
<seg id="847">But this is not so sure.</seg>
<seg id="848">One thing is clear, however -- we received our stem cells from these cells.</seg>
<seg id="849">We are facing a potential cell source that enables brain healing.</seg>
<seg id="850">We had to prove that.</seg>
<seg id="851">So we decided to develop an experiment.</seg>
<seg id="852">We wanted to take a piece of brain mass out of the non-linguistic area and then cultivate the cells exactly as it did Jean-François.</seg>
<seg id="853">And then mark them color in order to be able to track them in the brain.</seg>
<seg id="854">In the last step, we re-enrolled them at the unloading point of the same individual.</seg>
<seg id="855">We call the autologous transplant -- Autotransplantation.</seg>
<seg id="856">One of our first questions was: what happens when we re-implant these cells into normal brain tissue? and what will happen when we re-implant the same cells into damaged brain tissue?</seg>
<seg id="857">Thanks to the help of Prof. Eric Rouiller we were able to work with apes.</seg>
<seg id="858">In the first scenario, we re-invaded the cells into a healthy brain, and we observed that after a few weeks they disappeared completely, as if they had been removed again, they go back home. the space is already occupied, they are not needed, so they disappear.</seg>
<seg id="859">In the second scenario we put an injury to and reimplenned exactly the same cells and now the cells remained -- they grew up to mature neurons.</seg>
<seg id="860">Here you see what we were able to observe under the microscope.</seg>
<seg id="861">These are the cells that have been reimplenned.</seg>
<seg id="862">The evidence they show are these small points. these are the cells we paint in vitro, in culture.</seg>
<seg id="863">Of course we could not stop here.</seg>
<seg id="864">Do these cells also help a monkey to recover from a brain injury?</seg>
<seg id="865">So we trained monkeys with a manual dexterity problem.</seg>
<seg id="866">They had to take food pellets from a tray.</seg>
<seg id="867">They made it very good.</seg>
<seg id="868">When they reached a stable level of skill, we injured the motor skills range in the motor cortex.</seg>
<seg id="869">As a result, the monkeys were paralysed, they could no longer move their hands.</seg>
<seg id="870">Just as it would happen in humans, they spontaneously recovered up to a certain degree, just as after a stroke.</seg>
<seg id="871">Patients are paralyzed and then they try to recover with the help of plastic brain mechanisms. they recover to a certain degree, just like monkeys.</seg>
<seg id="872">When we were sure that the monkey had reached his degree of spontaneous recovery, we implanted his own cells.</seg>
<seg id="873">On the left you see the monkey, who recovered spontaneously.</seg>
<seg id="874">It can provide about 40% to 50% of its original performance from injury.</seg>
<seg id="875">It is not so precise and not so fast.</seg>
<seg id="876">Now see when we reimplted the cells: the same monkey, two months after the rice plantation.</seg>
<seg id="877">I can tell you that were very exciting results for us as well.</seg>
<seg id="878">Since that time, we have found a lot more about these cells.</seg>
<seg id="879">We can freeze them and use them later.</seg>
<seg id="880">We can use it in other neuropathological models, for example in Parkinson's disease.</seg>
<seg id="881">But our dream is still to impede them in humans.</seg>
<seg id="882">I really hope that I will soon show you how the human brain gives us the means to heal itself.</seg>
<seg id="883">Thank you very much.</seg>
<seg id="884">Bruno Giussani: Jocelyne, that's wonderful, I'm sure that just now, several dozen people in the audience, maybe even the majority, think: "I know someone who can do it."</seg>
<seg id="885">I definitely.</seg>
<seg id="886">Of course, the question is what the greatest obstacles are before you can start clinical trials in humans.</seg>
<seg id="887">Jocelyne Bloch: the biggest obstacles are the authorities. starting from these great results you have to fill about two kilograms of papers and forms to pass through these types of studies.</seg>
<seg id="888">BG: this is understandable, the brain is very delicate, etc.</seg>
<seg id="889">JB: yes, but it takes a long time, a lot of patience and an almost professional team.</seg>
<seg id="890">BG: look into the future -- you have completed the research and tried to get permission to start clinical trials. if you continue to look into the future, how many years it will take until someone can get to the hospital and this therapy will be available.</seg>
<seg id="891">JB: that's hard to say.</seg>
<seg id="892">First, it depends on the approval of the clinical study.</seg>
<seg id="893">Will the authorities allow us to start it soon?</seg>
<seg id="894">Then you have to carry out this study with a small group of patients.</seg>
<seg id="895">It takes a long time to select patients to perform treatments and evaluate whether it is useful to make this kind of treatment.</seg>
<seg id="896">Then you have to apply this to a multicenter study.</seg>
<seg id="897">You first have to prove that it is useful before you can offer this treatment to anyone.</seg>
<seg id="898">BG: and that it is safe, of course. JB: of course.</seg>
<seg id="899">BG: Jocelyne, thank you for visiting TED and telling us about it.</seg>
<seg id="900">BG: thank you very much.</seg>
<seg id="901">Democracy.</seg>
<seg id="902">We in the West make a big mistake to consider them as a matter of course.</seg>
<seg id="903">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "we do not see democracy as the fragile plant it is in reality but as an inventory of our society." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="904">We tend to look at it as an immutable asset.</seg>
<seg id="905">We believe that capitalism inevitably leads to democracy.</seg>
<seg id="906">That is not true.</seg>
<seg id="907">Lee Kuan Yew from Singapore and his great imitators in Beijing proved beyond doubt that it is possible to have a thriving capitalism and an impressive growth, while politics remain completely undemocratic.</seg>
<seg id="908">In fact, democracy dwindles with us, in Europe.</seg>
<seg id="909">At the beginning of the year when I represented Greece -- the newly elected Greek government -- was unequivocally clear to me as finance minister in the Eurogroup that the democratic process of our country -- our elections -- should not influence the austerity programs realized in Greece.</seg>
<seg id="910">At this moment, I thought that there could be no better justification for Lee Kuan Yew or the Communist Party of China, or some of my essual friends who repeatedly said that democracy would abolish if it would change anything.</seg>
<seg id="911">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "at this point, I would like to introduce you an economic model for real democracy." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="912">I ask you, together with me, to believe that Lee Kuan Yew, the Communist Party of China, and even the Eurogroup are mistaken, we could save us democracy, but that we need a true and defensive democracy.</seg>
<seg id="913">Without democracy, our societies are painted, our future will bleak and our great new technologies are wasted.</seg>
<seg id="914">On the subject of waste, I would like to point you to an interesting contradiction which currently threatens our economies.</seg>
<seg id="915">"" "" "" "I call it the" "" "" "" "twin peaks paradox." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="916">A summit is known to you. you know and recognize him as the debt mountain that throws his long shadow over the USA, Europe and the whole world.</seg>
<seg id="917">We all recognize the mountain of debt,</seg>
<seg id="918">But few recognize his twin.</seg>
<seg id="919">A mountain of untapped cash, which belongs to the high net worth savers and corporations, but they are too anxious to invest where it would be productive and income, with which you could wear the debt mountain and also produce all the things that humanity desperately needs, such as green energy.</seg>
<seg id="920">I call them two numbers.</seg>
<seg id="921">Over the past 3 months, the US, UK and the euro area have been investing 3.4 trillion US dollars, in all the wealth producing goods, such as industrial plants, machines, office buildings, schools, roads, tracks, equipment and so on and so on.</seg>
<seg id="922">3.4 trillion US dollars will sound after a lot of money, until one compares it to the 5,1 trillion US dollars, which at the same time lay around in the same countries and our financial institutions, and did absolutely nothing to inflate the stock markets and raise the real estate prices.</seg>
<seg id="923">Thus debt and unproductive capital form the twin peaks that do not compensate for the usual market mechanisms.</seg>
<seg id="924">The result is stagnating wages, more than a quarter of the 25-54-year-olds in the US, Japan and Europe, and consequently a low overall economic demand, which, as in a final loop, promotes the pessimism of investors who, from fear, the prophecy of the oracle could be true that his son would kill him if he is grown up,</seg>
<seg id="925">Involuntarily turns the circumstances causing the pus to kill him.</seg>
<seg id="926">This is my hatred with capitalism --</seg>
<seg id="927">All the unproductive capital should be used to improve our lives, to develop human talents and to finance especially all the technologies, "green" technologies that are decisive for the salvation of the earth.</seg>
<seg id="928">So is democracy the solution?</seg>
<seg id="929">But before we continue: what do we mean under democracy?</seg>
<seg id="930">Aristotle defined democracy as the social form in which the free and the poor control the government.</seg>
<seg id="931">The Athenian democracy, of course, closed too many --</seg>
<seg id="932">Women, foreigners, and of course slaves.</seg>
<seg id="933">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "however, it would be a mistake to mitigate the significance of Athenian democracy following these exclusions." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="934">The decisive factor in the Athenian democracy was and is that it withdrew the working poor, and not only gave them the right to freedom of expression, but more important and more crucial that they granted them the right to political co-determination with the same balance of votes in matters of state interests.</seg>
<seg id="935">The Athenian democracy hasn't lasted for a long time --</seg>
<seg id="936">Like a candle that shines brightly, it is burned out quickly.</seg>
<seg id="937">However, our current liberal democracies did not have their roots in ancient Athens,</seg>
<seg id="938">But in Magna Carta, in the glorious revolution of 1688, even in the American constitution.</seg>
<seg id="939">While Athenian democracy concentrated on the free citizens and strengthened the working poor, our liberal democracy is based on the values of Magna Carta, which ultimately was a statute for rulers.</seg>
<seg id="940">For the liberal democracy came only when a complete separation of politics and economy was possible and the democratic process was restricted to politics, while the economy -- i.e. the world of corporations -- became a democracy-free zone.</seg>
<seg id="941">In today's democracies there has been a relentless struggle between the two since the time this separation of politics and economy began, by shifting the economy slowly and dismaying it.</seg>
<seg id="942">Are you wondering why the politicians are no longer the same as before?</seg>
<seg id="943">It is not a degeneration of their DNA.</seg>
<seg id="944">It is because today it is possible to be in the government and still not in power because the power is diverted from politics into the economy and the areas are separated.</seg>
<seg id="945">I mentioned my hair with capitalism.</seg>
<seg id="946">If you think about it, it's about like a herd of predators who so sustainably deplete the animals that feed them, that they are starving at the end.</seg>
<seg id="947">Similarly, it is with the economy that has so far cannized politics that it harms itself through the self-caused economic crisis itself. the power of corporations grows, political goods are devalued, the inequality rises, the macroeconomic demand falls, and the directors of the corporations are too anxious to invest the cash of their companies.</seg>
<seg id="948">The more successful capitalism drives the "demos" of democracy, the higher the twin peaks, and the greater the waste of human labour power and the prosperity of humanity.</seg>
<seg id="949">If that is true, it is obvious that we have to reunite the politics and the economy, and it would be better if the "demos" keeps control, just as in ancient Athens, apart from the exclusion of slaves, women and foreigners.</seg>
<seg id="950">By the way, this is not a new idea.</seg>
<seg id="951">The Marxist left had this idea 100 years ago and it was not very good.</seg>
<seg id="952">The doctrine of the debacle of the Soviet Union should be that the working poor can only regain a position as in ancient Athens through a miracle without creating new ways of brutality and extravagance.</seg>
<seg id="953">But there is one solution: to abolish the working poor!</seg>
<seg id="954">Capitalism does it by replacing low-wage workers with automation and robots.</seg>
<seg id="955">The problem is, as long as economy and politics are separate areas, automation makes the twin peaks rise, the waste is more sublime, and social conflicts lower, as it is - very soon, as I believe -- will come in countries like China.</seg>
<seg id="956">So we have to transform the economy and reunite the spheres of economy and politics, and ensure that we democratize the reunited section, otherwise we end up in a pathological surveillance hyperautocracy, which lets the film "matrix" appear as a documentary.</seg>
<seg id="957">The question is therefore not whether capitalism will survive the technical achievements which it has produced --</seg>
<seg id="958">The more interesting question is whether capitalism is replaced by a dystopia, similar to that in "matrix," or by something similar to society in "Star Trek," in which machines serve man and people indulge their energy into the exploration of the universe, or into a high-tech version of the ancient Athenians "Agora," in long talks the meaning of life.</seg>
<seg id="959">I think we can be optimistic.</seg>
<seg id="960">So what would it be like to have this "Star Trek" -like utopia instead of the "matrix" -like dystopia?</seg>
<seg id="961">In practical implementation, I would like to give you some examples shortly.</seg>
<seg id="962">In the business area: please introduce a capital market in which you earn money while you work and in which your capital follows you from one work place to the next, from one company to the next, and the company -- no matter in which one is currently working -- is the property of those currently working in the company.</seg>
<seg id="963">Then all revenues come from capital and from revenues and the concept of wage labour is completely overhauled.</seg>
<seg id="964">No distinction more between those who belong to the companies, but who do not work in it, and employees who work there, which the company does not belong to. no more exchange between capital and labor, no large gaps between investment and savings, and ultimately no towering twin peaks.</seg>
<seg id="965">In the field of global political economy, please introduce briefly that our national currencies would have a freely fluctuating exchange rate, in a universal, global, digital currency, which is issued by the IMF [International Monetary Fund] and the G-20 [Group of the 20 largest emerging countries], in the interest of all mankind.</seg>
<seg id="966">Imagine that the entire world trade is traded in this currency -- we call it "the cosmos," in units of "cosmos" -- and every government pays the sum equal to the trade deficit or the trade surplus of the respective country into a common fund.</seg>
<seg id="967">Imagine that this fund invests in green technologies, especially in parts of the world where investment funds are rare.</seg>
<seg id="968">This is not a new idea.</seg>
<seg id="969">It is basically what John Maynard Keynes proposed at the 1944 Bretton Woods Conference.</seg>
<seg id="970">The problem was that at that time one had not the technical means to implement it.</seg>
<seg id="971">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "today we have them, especially against the background of a reunited politics and economy." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="972">The world I describe to you is simultaneously liberal, in which it favors privileged persons, and Marxist, because it will have buried the separation of capital and labor in the trash of history, and Keynesian, global Keynesian.</seg>
<seg id="973">But above all else, it is a world in which we can imagine a real democracy.</seg>
<seg id="974">We will awaken in such a world</seg>
<seg id="975">Or will we sink into a "matrix" - similar dystopia?</seg>
<seg id="976">The answer depends on how we decide together politically.</seg>
<seg id="977">It is in our hands and we do it better democratic.</seg>
<seg id="978">Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="979">Bruno Giussani: Yanis...</seg>
<seg id="980">You describe yourself as libertarian Marxists in your biography.</seg>
<seg id="981">How relevant is Marx's analysis today?</seg>
<seg id="982">Yanis Varoufakis: if anything of what I have just said is relevant, then Marx is relevant.</seg>
<seg id="983">The reason for the reunification of politics and economy is... Do we not do this, technological development will produce such a massive decline in aggregate demand, which Larry Summers referred to as "long-term stagnation."</seg>
<seg id="984">By transferring this crisis from one part of the Earth to the next as we are currently experiencing, it will not only destabilize our democracies, but also the countries whose interest in liberal democracy is low.</seg>
<seg id="985">If this analysis is true, then Marx is quite relevant,</seg>
<seg id="986">Just like Hayek, that's why I am a liberal Marxist, and like Keynes, and that's why I am completely mad.</seg>
<seg id="987">BG: actually, and now we are.</seg>
<seg id="988">YV: if you're not confused, you don't think about it enough.</seg>
<seg id="989">BG: this is a very Greek, a kind of philosophical explanation -- YV: actually it was Einstein who said it. BG: in your lecture you mentioned Singapore and China and yesterday at dinner of the speakers you have said very clearly what you consider from the West's perspective on China.</seg>
<seg id="990">Would you like to repeat it here?</seg>
<seg id="991">YV: there is a great measure of hypocrisy.</seg>
<seg id="992">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "in our liberal democracies, we have the appearance of democracy." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="993">As I said in my lecture, we have limited democracy to politics, while the area where most plays out - the sphere of economy -- is a completely democratic zone.</seg>
<seg id="994">In a sense, if I can say so provocative, China is today similar to the England of the 19th century.</seg>
<seg id="995">For -- remember -- we tend to combine liberalism with democracy -- this is an error, historically regarded.</seg>
<seg id="996">Liberalism, Liberals, as John Stuart Mill --</seg>
<seg id="997">He was particularly sceptical about the democratic development.</seg>
<seg id="998">What can be observed now in China is similar to the development we had in England during the industrial revolution, especially the transition from the first to the second.</seg>
<seg id="999">China now reproaches to do what the West has done in the nineteenth century, smells mightily after hypocrisy.</seg>
<seg id="1000">BG: I am sure that many listeners are curious about your experiences as finance ministers of Greece at the beginning of the year.</seg>
<seg id="1001">YV: I guessed that this is coming.</seg>
<seg id="1002">BG: yes...</seg>
<seg id="1003">How do you look back six months later in the first six months?</seg>
<seg id="1004">YV: very exciting, from a personal point of view, and very disappointing, as we had the opportunity to start a new beginning with the euro zone,</seg>
<seg id="1005">Not only Greece, but the Eurozone,</seg>
<seg id="1006">Namely to say goodbye to ourselves and the perpetual denial that a massive fault line passed through the Eurozone, and continues to be progressively threatened by the development of the whole European Union.</seg>
<seg id="1007">We had the opportunity, based on the Greek proposal -- by the way, the first proposal that revealed this denial --</seg>
<seg id="1008">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "unfortunately, the powers within the eurozone, within the European group, have continued to denounce the denial." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1009">But you know what's coming.</seg>
<seg id="1010">This is the experience of the Soviet Union --</seg>
<seg id="1011">If you try to maintain an economic system that is not viable to live by political will and authoritarianism, you may be able to delay it for a while, but when the changes occur, it happens abruptly and destructive.</seg>
<seg id="1012">BG: what changes do you foresee?</seg>
<seg id="1013">YV: there is no doubt that the Eurozone has no future if we do not change its structure.</seg>
<seg id="1014">BG: did you make any mistakes in your time as finance minister?</seg>
<seg id="1015">YV: every day.</seg>
<seg id="1016">BG: for example? YV: anyone looking back -- Seriously...</seg>
<seg id="1017">If there is a Minister of Finance, or any minister, who after 6 months in office, especially in such a tense situation, claims that he has made no mistake, then that is a dangerous person.</seg>
<seg id="1018">Of course I made mistakes.</seg>

<seg id="1038">Many have never heard of Roy Price, although he is probably responsible for 22 mediocre minutes of your life on April 19, 2013.</seg>
<seg id="1039">Probably also for 22 very entertaining minutes, but not for very many of you.</seg>
<seg id="1040">That goes back to the decision Roy met three years ago.</seg>
<seg id="1041">Roy Price is a senior employee at Amazon Studios,</seg>
<seg id="1042">The TV production company from Amazon.</seg>
<seg id="1043">He is 47 years old, slim, has an icon-haircut and describes himself on Twitter as "Movies, TV, Technique, Tacos."</seg>
<seg id="1044">Roy has a very important job because he is responsible for selecting the shows and the content that Amazon will produce.</seg>
<seg id="1045">Of course, this is a very hard-fought industry.</seg>
<seg id="1046">There are already so many TV series that Roy is not able to select any one.</seg>
<seg id="1047">He has to find shows that are very, very good.</seg>
<seg id="1048">In other words, it has to find shows that are located at the very right of that curve.</seg>
<seg id="1049">This curve is the valuation distribution of more than 2500 TV series on the website IMDB. the rating goes from 1 to 10 and the height shows how many shows receive this rating.</seg>
<seg id="1050">If your show is valued at nine and higher, this is a winner.</seg>
<seg id="1051">Then you have a successful show.</seg>
<seg id="1052">These are shows like "Breaking Bad," "Game of Thrones," "The Wire" -- all the shows that are addictive, where after watching a season, your brain asks: "where are more of these episodes?"</seg>
<seg id="1053">This kind of show.</seg>
<seg id="1054">On the left side, here at this end, shows like "Toddlers and Tiaras" -- -- that should tell you enough what's going on at this end of the curve.</seg>
<seg id="1055">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "Roy Price does not worry about getting to the left side of the corner because I think you need special intelligence to forbid" Toddlers and Tiaras. "" "" "" "</seg>
<seg id="1056">He gets more thoughts about the middle expression, the average television -- the shows that are neither good nor bad, they simply don't inspire.</seg>
<seg id="1057">So he must make sure he's really on the right side.</seg>
<seg id="1058">The pressure is present, and of course it's the first time that Amazon is doing something, that's why Roy Price doesn't want to risk anything.</seg>
<seg id="1059">He wants to create success.</seg>
<seg id="1060">He needs guaranteed success, so he holds a contest.</seg>
<seg id="1061">He takes many ideas for TV shows and selects eight candidates for TV shows through an evaluation, then he produces the first episode of each of these shows and places them online where they can watch them for free.</seg>
<seg id="1062">And if Amazon comes out for free things, do you still access, right?</seg>
<seg id="1063">Millions of viewers watch these episodes.</seg>
<seg id="1064">However, they do not know that they are observed when watching these shows.</seg>
<seg id="1065">They are watched by Roy and his team who record everything.</seg>
<seg id="1066">You record when you start the show when you pause, which parts one skips or looks again.</seg>
<seg id="1067">They collect millions of data to decide which show they should produce.</seg>
<seg id="1068">In fact, they collect the data, process it, and this results in the answer, and this is: "Amazon should make a sitcom over four Republican US senators."</seg>
<seg id="1069">They did this show.</seg>
<seg id="1070">Does anybody know the name of this show?</seg>
<seg id="1071">"" "" "" "yes," "" "" "" "Alpha House" "" "" "", "but it seems that not many can remember this show because it wasn't that good." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1072">It's just an average show -- in the truest sense of the word -- because the average of this turn is 7.4 and Alpha House lands with 7.5 -- so slightly above average, but not exactly what Roy and his team worked.</seg>
<seg id="1073">About the same time at another company another manager placed a top show through data analysis. his name is Ted, Ted Sarandos, the manager for programming Netflix. just like Roy he is always looking to find them a super show and he also uses data for it, but he makes it a little different.</seg>
<seg id="1074">Instead of organizing a contest, he and his team looked at the available data on the Netflix audience, so the ratings they give to the shows, the course of which shows they like etc.</seg>
<seg id="1075">Then they use this data to find out these little details about the audience: what shows they like, which producers, which actors.</seg>
<seg id="1076">When they had all the parts together they entered a venture and decided not to make a sitcom via four senators, but a drama series about a Senator.</seg>
<seg id="1077">Do you know this show?</seg>
<seg id="1078">Yes, "House of Cards." Netflix has landed a hit with it, at least for the first two seasons.</seg>
<seg id="1079">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "House of Cards" "" "" "" "gets a 9.1 rating on this curve. so exactly where they wanted to go." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1080">Of course, the question is: what has happened here?</seg>
<seg id="1081">It has two very competitive, data-sealed companies.</seg>
<seg id="1082">They connect these many data to each other and it works great for one of them, but not for the other company.</seg>
<seg id="1083">What is this?</seg>
<seg id="1084">Because logic says somehow that this should work with everything.</seg>
<seg id="1085">If you collect millions of data for a decision you make, you should make a good decision.</seg>
<seg id="1086">It has 200 years of statistics as back-up.</seg>
<seg id="1087">You optimize it with very high-performance computers.</seg>
<seg id="1088">The least thing you can expect is good television, doesn't it?</seg>
<seg id="1089">If data analysis does not work, it is a little frightening because we live in a time where we take more and more statistics to make serious decisions, far beyond television.</seg>
<seg id="1090">Does anyone know the company Multi-Health Systems?</seg>
<seg id="1091">No one. OK, that's even good.</seg>
<seg id="1092">Multi-Health Systems is a software company and I hope no one in this space will ever come into contact with this software. come in touch with it, you are in prison.</seg>
<seg id="1093">If anyone is in jail here in the US and asks for dismissal, it is likely that the data analysis of this company is used to determine whether there is a discharge or not.</seg>
<seg id="1094">Just like Amazon and Netflix. but instead of deciding whether a show will be good or bad, it will be decided whether a person will be good or bad.</seg>
<seg id="1095">Moderate TV, 22 minutes, that can be real bad, but even more years in prison are worse.</seg>
<seg id="1096">Unfortunately, there is evidence that this data analysis, despite the many data,</seg>
<seg id="1097">Not always creating the best results. that's not because a company like Multi-Health Systems does not know how to use data.</seg>
<seg id="1098">Even the most experienced companies are wrong.</seg>
<seg id="1099">Yes, even Google sometimes makes mistakes.</seg>
<seg id="1100">In 2009, Google announced that it could predict breaks of flu, the bad way, through data analysis of the Google research.</seg>
<seg id="1101">It worked wonderfully and was a big news sensation. the success culminated in a publication in the journal Nature.</seg>
<seg id="1102">It worked perfectly, year by year, until it suddenly ceased to work,</seg>
<seg id="1103">And no one could say why.</seg>
<seg id="1104">It simply did not work, this was once again a sensation, including the revocation of publication in the journal Nature.</seg>
<seg id="1105">Even the most experienced companies such as Amazon and Google sometimes misunderstand something.</seg>
<seg id="1106">Despite all these errors, data stream into decisions of life - at the workplace, in the law enforcement, in medicine.</seg>
<seg id="1107">So we should rather make sure that data is helpful.</seg>
<seg id="1108">I also know many difficulties with data. I work in computer-assisted genetics -- an area where some very wise people use unimaginably many data to make serious decisions, such as the decision for cancer therapy</seg>
<seg id="1109">Or the development of a drug. over the years I have recognized some patterns of the difference between successful decisions based on data and not successful decisions. this pattern should be spread.</seg>
<seg id="1110">If you have to solve a complex problem, mainly do two things:</seg>
<seg id="1111">First, disassemble this problem into its components so that you can analyze the items; as a second, put the items together again to make a decision.</seg>
<seg id="1112">Sometimes you have to do this several times, but there are always two things: take apart and put together again.</seg>
<seg id="1113">And now the most important thing: data and data analysis are only good for the first part.</seg>
<seg id="1114">Data and data analysis, no matter how powerful, can only help disassemble a problem and understand its parts.</seg>
<seg id="1115">They are not suitable to assemble the parts again and then come to a decision.</seg>
<seg id="1116">There is another tool for it and we all possess it: our brain.</seg>
<seg id="1117">If there is something in which the brain is good, it is necessary to re-assemble parts and pieces even if the information is incomplete, in order to make a good decision -- especially if it is the brain of an expert.</seg>
<seg id="1118">That's why I think Netflix was so successful because they used data and minds where they also belong in the process.</seg>
<seg id="1119">They use data to better understand their audience, which they otherwise would not have been capable of. but the decision on how to take all these parts together again and make a show like "House of Cards" is not in the data.</seg>
<seg id="1120">Ted Sarandos and his team made this decision for this show, which meant that they had a big personal risk involved in this decision.</seg>
<seg id="1121">Amazon, on the other hand, did this in the wrong way.</seg>
<seg id="1122">They used data to control all their decisions, first when they were competing for TV ideas, then selecting "Alpha House" as a show.</seg>
<seg id="1123">"" "" "" "it was a secure decision because they could always say:" "" "" "" "they tell us the data." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1124">It did not lead to the desired result.</seg>
<seg id="1125">Data is helpful for better decisions, but I think things go wrong when data is starting to control our decisions.</seg>
<seg id="1126">No matter how powerful they are, data is just a tool, and in order not to forget this, this device is quite useful.</seg>
<seg id="1127">Many of you will...</seg>
<seg id="1128">Before there was data, this was the device for decisions.</seg>
<seg id="1129">Many know it.</seg>
<seg id="1130">It's also called "Magic 8 Ball." it's amazing. for decisions using a Ja- or No question you just have to shake the ball to get an answer. "most likely," right here at this moment.</seg>
<seg id="1131">I will try it later with a technical demo.</seg>
<seg id="1132">So far, I have made some decisions in my life, whereby I should have listened to the ball in hindsight.</seg>
<seg id="1133">But, as you know, of course, if you have the data available, you would like to replace it with a little more sophisticated than data analysis to make better decisions.</seg>
<seg id="1134">But this does not change the basic structure.</seg>
<seg id="1135">In the end it's up to us to make decisions when we want to reach something extraordinary at the end of the right corner.</seg>
<seg id="1136">And I feel this as a very encouraging message that despite the large amount of data, it still pays off to make decisions, to be an expert in what you do and take risks.</seg>
<seg id="1137">Because in the end, it is not the data, but the risks with which you land at the right end of the curve.</seg>
<seg id="1138">Thank you very much.</seg>
