Munich 18@@ 56 : four maps that change your view of the city
an Ir@@ ren @-@ Anst@@ alt , where teenagers should meet today .
a cryp@@ t where it is now du@@ g for the S @-@ Bahn tunnel .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; farmers cultivate the former land of farmers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the oldest official map of Munich promotes exciting stories on days .
it anno@@ ys when maps are not up @-@ to @-@ date .
everybody knows this , who had to upset already , because the car navigation system showed a green meadow instead of a b@@ ypass road .
the historical maps of the digital Bayern @-@ At@@ las@@ es , an offer of the ge@@ op@@ ort@@ as Bavaria of the state government , are anything but up @-@ to @-@ date - but very insi@@ ghtful .
especially when comparing them with current online cards .
then it becomes clear how towns and communities have changed in the spread @-@ area of the Munich Mer@@ cury since the 19th century .
the digital Bayern @-@ Atlas is a Fli@@ ck@@ ent@@ ep@@ p@@ ich , which one does not recognize as such .
in the big picture postcard , more detailed maps , so @-@ called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , were incorporated into the big picture postcard . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to the Bavarian surve@@ ying management , these were created between 18@@ 10 and 18@@ 64 and originate from Bavaria &apos;s first survey .
your principal : Napoleon .
the French army leader occupied Bavaria since the spring of 1800 during the Second Coalition War with Austria .
Napoleon wanted an overview of the occupied country and commissioned a top@@ ographic survey of Bavaria - of course for military purposes .
even though the French troops stopped at the peace of Lun@@ é@@ ville on February 9 , 18@@ 01 , it was the neighbours of today who created the idea of an area @-@ wide area of Bavaria .
Elec@@ tor Max IV Joseph drove the project forward , founded the &quot; Top@@ ographic Bureau &quot; - and thus the Bavarian surve@@ ying management .
the composition sheet for Munich dates back to 18@@ 56 and can be found on the Bay@@ erische Landes@@ bibliothek as well as any other on the website of the Bavarian State Library .
the comparison of early / today is the most impressive example of the state capital .
the city has expanded in all directions and has grown together .
one example of this is Unter@@ sen@@ d@@ ling , which appears relatively isolated in the map of 18@@ 56 .
Send@@ ling was built 21 years after the map was created , i.e. in 18@@ 77 , as the Munich subur@@ b .
today , Unter@@ sen@@ d@@ ling is located in the middle of the city .
the houses of Unter@@ sen@@ d@@ lings are concentrated around 18@@ 56 along the present @-@ day Pl@@ ing@@ an@@ ser@@ strasse , which was first named after Georg Sebastian Pl@@ ing@@ an@@ ser in 18@@ 78 , a leader of the uprising of the Bavarian peasants against Austria in 17@@ 05 .
where today is the West@@ park , one does not see anything as fields - at first glance : when zo@@ oming in , a smaller card with dozens of lines and numbers appears : hand @-@ numbered flakes from the so @-@ called &quot; pri@@ me@@ val &quot; from which the basic tax was derived .
small plots have no farmers today , but small gar@@ den@@ ers of the facility &quot; Land in Sun . &quot;
a large green area is characterized north of Unter@@ sen@@ d@@ ling .
Ther@@ esi@@ en@@ wi@@ ese , the scene of the Oktober@@ fest in 18@@ 10 , was actually still a meadow - and no concrete desert .
on the other side of the Is@@ ar , the historical map gives an insight into the history of psychiat@@ ric medicine .
in the data sheet , in the area of the present district Au @-@ Hai@@ d@@ hausen , one reads not only the street name &quot; at the Gast@@ ei@@ g &quot; or from the height &quot; On the Lü@@ fts &quot; - but also in large letters &quot; Ir@@ ren Anst@@ alt . &quot;
yes , here at the Au@@ er@@ feld@@ straße you once locked people with ins@@ anity .
in 18@@ 58 / 59 the Munich @-@ based Ir@@ ren@@ anstalt district &quot; On the Au@@ er Lü@@ fts &quot; was created .
from 18@@ 72 , Dr. Bernhard von Gu@@ dden headed the institution - that psychiat@@ rist , who is brought in connection with the death of King Ludwig II .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he was progressive for his time and ended , for example , the Kad@@ ets of so @-@ called Irish . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
moreover , he prohibited the staff to use violence against the occup@@ ants , &quot; says Hermann Wilhelm , head of the museum Hai@@ d@@ hausen , who worked for an exhibition with the institution .
for 280 patients was first place , later extended to 500 places .
at some point , this capacity was no longer sufficient - the reason for the construction of the Krei@@ si@@ r@@ ren@@ anstalt in Haar 1905 .
the Is@@ ar @-@ Amp@@ er @-@ Klin@@ ik@@ um Munich @-@ Ost , one of Germany &apos;s largest psychiat@@ ri@@ sts , has been there since 2006 .
young people now meet at Sal@@ esi@@ an@@ um in Munich .
the Order acquired the building complex in 1920 and converted it into a youth home with training facilities .
West is the football field of the TS@@ V München East , east residential buildings from the 1980s .
in 2015 , the children &apos;s house &quot; Casa Don Bos@@ co &quot; was built in an architectural approach to the original building of the Ir@@ ren@@ anstalt , which was destroyed during the Second World War in bomb attacks .
the Mari@@ en@@ platz was listed in 18@@ 56 as the &quot; main square , &quot; the Kauf@@ inger@@ strasse was called &quot; Kauf@@ inger G@@ asse . &quot;
the Second World War also brought a decisive change in the heart of Munich .
the bombs of the Al@@ lies broke many holes in the inner city in December 1944 .
a large remained until today - at the Mari@@ en@@ hof .
the English Institute , small business houses and a cryp@@ t chapel from the Middle Ages once stood at Mari@@ en@@ hof , where these days were the prepar@@ atory work and on 5 April 2017 the ground@@ breaking ceremony for the second S @-@ Bahn track .
with the sli@@ der you can compare the old Munich Map with the aerial view of today - and fill the hole at the Mari@@ en@@ hof .
civil Rights Group publishes travel warning for Mis@@ sour@@ i
the National Association for the Promotion of Far@@ mers has issued a warning for coloured people travelling to Mis@@ sour@@ i due to discrimin@@ atory policies and rac@@ ist attacks .
&quot; the NA@@ AC@@ P Travel Advisory for the State of Mis@@ sour@@ i , which is expected to enter into force by August 28 , 2017 , calls on Af@@ ro @-@ American travelers , visitors and Mis@@ sour@@ i to take special attention while travelling through the state , as a number of question@@ able , ra@@ cial occur@@ ren@@ ces appear in the entire state and be noted here , &quot; says the Group &apos;s opinion .
a recently passed law of Mis@@ sour@@ i , which makes it harder for people to win discrimination complaints , as well as the state prosec@@ uting authorities that dispro@@ portion@@ ately aim at minorities , prompted the group to issue the warning , the NA@@ AC@@ P said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they have violations of civil rights that happen to humans . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they are stopped because of their skin colour , they are beaten or killed , &quot; said the president of Mis@@ sour@@ i NA@@ AC@@ P , R@@ od Chapel , the K@@ ans@@ as City Star .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we hear complaints in such a frequency that we have not yet heard . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is the first such warning that the organization has issued for a state in the US . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the group quoted cases like ra@@ cial off@@ ences against black students at the University of Mis@@ sour@@ i and the death of T@@ ory S@@ anders , 28 , a black man from T@@ enn@@ es@@ see .
S@@ anders died under question@@ able circumstances at the beginning of the year , after he had no more fuel during the journey through the state and was put into custody by the Mis@@ sour@@ i police , without being accused of a crime .
the Council also points to a recent report by the Mis@@ sour@@ i Office of the Mis@@ sour@@ i Office , where it is shown that black mot@@ orists in the state will increase 75 percent more frequently than wh@@ ites .
&quot; the recommendation is that people are aware and inform their families , friends and employees about what could happen in Mis@@ sour@@ i , &quot; Chapel said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; people need to be willing to bring a deposit money or let relatives know that they travel through the state . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mis@@ sour@@ i reported 100 hate crimes in 2015 , according to the latest figures from the FB@@ I Hass@@ an Cri@@ mes report , which ranks the state in terms of the number of such violations to the 16th place of the country .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the travel warning is also an answer to a new Mis@@ sour@@ i law that would make it more difficult to acc@@ use a company for housing or employment discrimination . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
previously , the American Civil Liber@@ ties Union ( AC@@ L@@ U ) issued travel warnings for Texas and Arizona after the States had passed immigration laws to susp@@ end local law enforcement agencies to arrest people on the basis of AC@@ L@@ U &apos;s further race profile .
travel warnings are usually issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for other countries , but l@@ ately , interest groups have used the measure as a response to certain laws and trends within the United States .
electric fence project is elementary
the Fischer@@ bacher Wei@@ dez@@ au@@ n project is a successful project and will be continued next year .
the CD@@ U Members Peter Weiß and K@@ ord@@ ula K@@ ov@@ ac have taken a picture on the spot .
representatives of the Fis@@ bacher CD@@ U local association met with mayor Thomas Schneider and the two de@@ pu@@ ties at the Schwen@@ de@@ mann family &apos;s square yard .
Markus Schwen@@ de@@ mann first gave insights into his farm , in which he manages 55 hectares of meadows and 40 hectares of forest , 40 dairy cows and equally many juven@@ iles , and is accommod@@ ated in five apartments .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Black Forest &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is for him the alternative marketing path for the milk of his cows , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Schwen@@ de@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the table of the Feri@@ eng@@ a@@ ste comes exclusively Regi@@ on@@ ales .
since he is also the chairman of B@@ L@@ H@@ V of Fis@@ her@@ bach , he described the deci@@ ph@@ er project as &quot; elementary important . &quot;
I cannot profit on such steep surfaces .
the gr@@ ass@@ land area care for a lot of work , much needed to be handled with the brus@@ h@@ cutter .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have to fight here with the conditions and with the top@@ ography , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Schwen@@ de@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 2003 he took over the par@@ ental farm and managed it without chemical plant protection and fertili@@ ser , even if he does not conduct organic farming .
for mayor Thomas Schneider it was clear : &quot; the Commun@@ e has recognised the importance of the fence project and is glad about the leaders &quot; promotion . &quot;
at the cost of 3000 to 4000 euros per hectare , farmers need to be supported .
I hope that the aff@@ or@@ estation of the areas could be pulled out for quite a while .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the greatest treasure we have are the people who work in agriculture and think about how they will continue their operations , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the mayor . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
farmers are often in criticism because of the promotion
in 2013 , a total of 25 par@@ c@@ els were fenced by eleven participants .
the area of disclosure amounts to 40 hectares , which cannot be for@@ ested by at least 20@@ 23 .
half of the total cost of EUR 71 500 was promoted by leader , a quarter bore the municipality of Fisch@@ bach .
thus the farmers remained 12 6@@ 10 euros , which they had to invest in 16.@@ 2 kilometres of pasture @-@ fence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the great advantage is the lon@@ ge@@ vity of the f@@ ences , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; declared Schwen@@ de@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
K@@ ord@@ ula K@@ ov@@ ac stressed : &quot; you are doing a really good job , without farmers and land@@ wives . &quot;
Peter Weiß asser@@ ts that &quot; the best foods are produced here . &quot;
the landscape care line ( L@@ PR ) Baden @-@ Wu@@ ert@@ tem@@ berg enables the state support of soft f@@ ences .
the goal is to keep the Black Forest open .
the pre @-@ requ@@ isite is the presence of a circul@@ ating system registered by the L@@ PR .
moreover , the fen@@ cing surface must not be trac@@ eable ( slope over 35 percent ) and must therefore be threatened by aff@@ or@@ estation .
at present , eight participants with 24 par@@ c@@ els , who want to build just under 16 kilometres of fence , are currently working for the Fis@@ her@@ s@@ bach Wei@@ ght@@ starter project 2018 .
the area of disclosure corresponds to 35 hectares , and the calculated costs are more than 112 000 euros .
is nothing more holy ?
now the White House of Tr@@ ump takes the Statue of Liberty
the saf@@ est sign of a regime change is when they begin to attack the statues .
the Americans appreciate these as well as any other - therefore the carefully staged fall of Saddam Hussein at the Fir@@ dos square in Bag@@ h@@ dad in 2003 .
Stephen Miller , one of the key ide@@ ologists of the Tr@@ ump regime , certainly knew what he did when he took a symbolic ax@@ e in a heated argument with Jim A@@ co@@ sta of CN@@ N about the President &apos;s proposals for the dr@@ astic restriction of legal immigration with the Statue of Liberty .
to be fair , Miller did not handle the statue itself .
a hor@@ de of boat owners and Liberty @-@ I@@ mit@@ eers would have liked him if he had done it .
but it took on its importance , and in particular the meaning that it was attributed to , when the famous poem by Emma Lazarus was added 17 years after the completion of the monument , its base .
when Miller picked up A@@ co@@ sta , &quot; I don &apos;t want to go into a complete thing about history here , but the Statue of Liberty is ... a symbol of American freedom that enligh@@ tens the world .
the poem you refer to is later added and is not part of the original Statue of Liberty . &quot;
Miller is fac@@ tually correct , but as he formulated it himself , it &apos;s not really about history .
it is about the contemporary response to the touching words of Lazarus , the only ones in which a state invites not only any old immigrants , but the poor@@ est of the poor : &quot; your tired , your poor , / your oppressed masses , who y@@ earn to breathe freely , the mis@@ erable drop of your rich coasts . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there was never a time when &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; poor apost@@ asy &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was better to see on our screens . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Miller was not engaged in literary criticism - he made it clear that these people in Tr@@ um@@ ps USA are not welcome .
this conflict because of the importance of a statue is part of a broader political and cultural debate : it is in fact a conflict around the significance of America .
Lazarus - and her friends who used to place their words after their death at the base - knew very well that they took up a highly political action .
the sculpture was intended to show the connections between French and American republi@@ can@@ ism by presenting the feminine em@@ bodi@@ ment of freedom in a worn classic portra@@ yal .
Lazarus has changed this meaning : in her poem the female figure is no longer abstra@@ c@@ ted - she has received a voice .
and she herself has a completely different name : mother of ex@@ iles .
the compound of the poem with the image is a brilliant femin@@ ist coup and a devastating attack on American N@@ ati@@ vis@@ m .
and just as Lazarus had changed the meaning of the statue , the people of the right wing wanted to change it for a long time .
the great writer R@@ ush Lim@@ bau@@ gh , a type of John the Baptist for the coming of Tr@@ ump , argued in 2010 that the Statue of Liberty would not invite anyone but rather an early neo @-@ conservative , who brings the American flame to the surrounding world : &quot; Lady Liberty goes forward .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it shall bear the torch of freedom from the United States to the rest of the world . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the torch should not enligh@@ ten the way to the United States . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
rather unusual is Lim@@ bau@@ gh stum@@ bled on something here .
the meaning of the statue is quite a question of the point of view of perception .
the great imagin@@ ative act of Lazarus was to see them as they were seen by the exhausted , el@@ event@@ ful , but hop@@ eful people after long and often terrible journeys on the de@@ cks of ships .
it is about seeing the world from the perspective of people who seek refuge and a chance to improve their lives .
her statue speaks to them the words of hope and the welcome they need to hear .
and that is , of course , not the perspective that Miller and Tr@@ ump would ever acknowledge .
their torch should not enligh@@ ten the way , but to ign@@ ite hatred that is their only source of power .
world Championship 2017 : N@@ eil Black lo@@ aves Scottish members of the UK team
E@@ ili@@ d@@ h Do@@ yle reminis@@ ces about a time when only two Scot@@ s@@ men belonged to the Team of Britain
the performance director of the United Kingdom &apos;s Ath@@ le@@ tics , N@@ eil Black , says that the 16 @-@ strong Scottish cont@@ ingent in world championship cad@@ res will make a massive contribution to the team . &quot;
a record number of Scottish athletes was chosen for London 2017 which ki@@ cks off on Friday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; black believes that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; something special is developed in Scotland &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and the UK &apos;s athle@@ tics have to learn from it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we welcome it and we try to understand it and we will continue until we find it out , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Black . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I talk to people at the Scottish Institute of Sports and they think it has something to do with what they have done . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Scottish athletes think it has something to do with what they have done .
British Ath@@ le@@ tics : it has something to do with what they have done .
and also with the type at the corner .
whatever the combination of circumstances is , it &apos;s absolutely brilliant . &quot;
several of the Scottish athletes are med@@ als , including Laura Mu@@ ir and Andrew But@@ chart - who are competing against Sir Mo Far@@ ah on the 5,000 m distance , while E@@ ili@@ d@@ h Do@@ yle was chosen by the team captain .
&quot; E@@ ili@@ d@@ h is quite modest .
their Captain &apos;s speech was incredible , &quot; says Black .
&quot; a number of athletes , whether they were Scottish or wherever they live or train , went out of space and felt very proud and were very motivated .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the passion and the real feeling that E@@ ili@@ d@@ h naturally brought in were great . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Com@@ mon@@ wealth silver medal winner , who will compete for the 400 @-@ m hur@@ d@@ les at their fifth world champi@@ onships , says it is &quot; unbelievable &quot; that 16 Sc@@ ots are in the British team .
Scotland &apos;s best total number of athletes at the World Cup was seven , which were achieved in 1983 and 2015 .
the middle @-@ distance runner , Mu@@ ir , is leading this way and has set five British and two European records last year .
it will take part at the 1,500 m and the 5,000 m runs .
Chris O &apos;@@ H@@ are , who runs 1,500 m , is another Scot@@ s@@ man to watch for a great season that included winning the British Team Tri@@ als and Anni@@ versary Games .
Do@@ yle re@@ members her first world champi@@ onships as the only other Scot@@ s@@ man in Team Lee Mc@@ Conn@@ ell .
the team captain says that they are &quot; hu@@ gely proud &quot; of the fact that many of their comp@@ atri@@ ots are not only part of the team , but in some cases also join the med@@ als and the fin@@ als .
&quot; the special thing about being a team captain is that it was chosen by the other members of the team , so it was a great honour anyway , but knowing that my te@@ amm@@ ate voted for me and chose me makes it something special for me , &quot; she added .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; obviously I am very proud of all the Sc@@ ots belonging to the team . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it only shows how far we came .
and they are here as well @-@ established athletes , athletes who want to climb to po@@ di@@ ums .
what does my speech refer to as a Captain ?
yes , I think she went well .
I have only pointed out that we are very happy in this situation as we have a home world championship .
so it is really important to rely on this support and benefit from the fact that we are in the Olympiastadion again .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I get a second chance to go there and compete and it will simply be such a great atmosphere out there . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
block critics on Facebook : do not apply for a public office if you cannot tolerate the heating of voters
the father of our country knew something of bad press .
the Americans loved George Washington , but it did not take long until the newspapers hit him because of everything , from domestic politics to his political principles .
he kno@@ cked at the cri@@ tique , for sure .
but he did not silence his critics .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in 17@@ 83 , Washington said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; freedom of speech can be taken away - and , stupid and mu@@ te we are led like sheep for slaughter . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
that brings me to Mary@@ land to Gover@@ nor Lar@@ ry Ho@@ gan who has to work to be more like Washington .
Ho@@ gan &apos;s employees have blocked and deleted the contributions of at least 450 people who have expressed their opinion on his official Facebook page .
and the American Civil Liber@@ ties Union therefore compl@@ ained about it at the beginning of this week .
the Gover@@ nor &apos;s staff dismissed the complaint as fri@@ vol@@ ous , and the online comment was full of a counter @-@ reaction with &quot; Na , and ? . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s just Facebook , &quot; many people said .
but it is important .
and it is especially important if it is a type like Ho@@ gan .
this is a republi@@ can governor in an overwhelming democratic state which is amaz@@ ingly popular .
he has the second highest consent of the nation &apos;s 50 govern@@ ors .
Ho@@ gan is not a reactionary heat @-@ head .
he has demonstrated a strong hand in the leadership of his state and strict adher@@ ence to the principles .
he was also very sk@@ il@@ ful in using Facebook as a primary means to connect with his elec@@ tors and to de@@ press his hair @-@ less head after chemotherapy on his side .
therefore , the block@@ age of persons coming to the govern@@ ors &quot; side is un@@ necessarily and ultimately dangerous for employees who are paid with public tax dollars .
in an interview with The Washington Post , Ho@@ gan &apos;s spokesperson , Am@@ elia Ch@@ asse , defended the actions of the governor and argued that blocking the comments was nothing more than a facil@@ itation .
but it is too easy to use the image of tro@@ lls or sp@@ amm@@ ers or hat@@ eful people who swing the whi@@ p online .
the post talked to some of the real people who were blocked by Ho@@ gan .
and these are only real people who speak with their elected leaders : a teacher , an entrepren@@ eur and a priest , no tro@@ lls .
they all said their comments were respect@@ ful , thou@@ ghtful and non @-@ prof@@ ane .
the priest quoted the Bible in his post and appe@@ aled to Ho@@ gans Catholic faith .
lawyer Lak@@ sh@@ mi Sar@@ ma Ram@@ ani of Bo@@ wie , M@@ d . , was not crowded , but she asked for hate crimes .
&quot; I said pol@@ itely that I was disappointed that there was no reaction to hate crimes and other current news , &quot; she wrote in the comment section of the news broadcast &quot; The Post . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t like this idea , if a number of people take a position on the same subject , then they are dis@@ regarded by some rather than a so @-@ called collective commitment and not recognized as a large group of affected citizens . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what the Gover@@ nor &apos;s staff marked as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; concentrated spam &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; would probably call &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; interc@@ ession . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Facebook era simply makes it easy to cut a message by simply blocking a critic or dropping a negative comment .
it is much cleaner than in earlier times , if you have done the same thing that employees have been sent to collect and burn newspapers with critical cor@@ mor@@ ants or to arrest and silence demonstr@@ ators .
but that &apos;s exactly what happens digitally .
Ho@@ gan is not the first public official to critici@@ ze Facebook and other social media .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; President Tr@@ ump is accused of Twitter users who were blocked by his Twitter feed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
one of the first mil@@ estones in this issue was last week in Virginia .
the Chairman of the Board of Super@@ vis@@ ors of the Lou@@ dou@@ n County injured the First A@@ mend@@ ment , according to US District Ju@@ dge James C. C@@ ach@@ er@@ is in Alexand@@ ria , when she banned a vot@@ er from her Facebook page .
and in K@@ entu@@ cky , Gover@@ nor Matt Bev@@ in ( R ) also received a visit from the AC@@ L@@ U because of his use of Facebook and Twitter .
this should not be so difficult .
at the time of Washington , the time of affordable payments had a similar effect as the internet .
the number of newspapers was multiplied between 17@@ 76 and 1800 , and anonymous letters of letters fell on his lead .
and even then , Washington had anonymous tro@@ lls .
the people who used pseu@@ don@@ y@@ ms like &quot; jur@@ ic@@ ola , &quot; &quot; Val@@ eri@@ us , &quot; &quot; Bel@@ is@@ arius &quot; and &quot; Por@@ tius &quot; wrote all the letters to newspapers that made Washington decisions .
peti@@ tions critici@@ zed his position on the Treaty of Am@@ ity , the trade and shipping with Britain , over@@ came his ministry , according to the historical documents collected by the online Pap@@ ers of the George Washington Project .
but he did not silence her .
freedom of speech , dis@@ agreements and dis@@ courses are the foundation of our nation .
and true guidance means accepting this .
Ron@@ an Raff@@ er@@ ty hopes for domestic comfort in the Renaissance Club
the former European No. 1 Ron@@ an Raff@@ er@@ ty will hope for home comfort over the next three days since the Renaissance Club in East Lo@@ thi@@ an organizes the 25th edition of Scottish Senior Open .
the Nor@@ di@@ re , who last year passed the Arch@@ er@@ field left to the final round , before he lost Paul E@@ ales , is connected to the new venue and acts as a tournament ambassador on behalf of the founder and CE@@ Os Jer@@ ry Sar@@ v@@ adi .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I saw how the Renaissance Club was built , and we see how he achieved fame with this event , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Raff@@ er@@ ty said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; players will see this course from his best side , he &apos;s in a great state . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Jer@@ ry did a great job when he set out this place .
he is an ard@@ ent advoc@@ ate of this game and is proud of his performance here .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a great showcase for this course . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Engli@@ sh@@ man E@@ ales is looking forward to defending a championship for the first time , although in his 32 @-@ year career he won both the European Tour and the European Challenge Tour .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this really feels special , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the player based in South@@ port . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I cannot defend the Extre@@ ma@@ dura Open since it was taken out of the program in the year after I had won it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
coming back to this part of the world is magical .
it &apos; a wonderful place to play golf .
the memories from last year come back , and it was something special for me and my wife Shar@@ on to win here last year .
it was a really special time and one that we will always appreciate . &quot;
Gary Or@@ r , who came to the European Senior Tour after his 50@@ th birthday earlier this year , returns to his home country action .
this event will be its first Scottish performance since the Aber@@ deen Asset Management Scottish Open in 2013 .
&quot; it always means a bit more when you &apos;re playing at home , &quot; says Or@@ r , the man from Hel@@ ens@@ burgh .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you want to do it well , but you also feel that extra pressure . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I really enjoyed playing again and I played a solid gul@@ f .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m happy about the fact that it has gone so far . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

less pul@@ mon@@ ary cancer by passive smoking
in the past two decades , fewer and fewer people have died because of passive smoking in lung cancer .
this is the result of scientists from the University Hospital Hamburg @-@ E@@ pp@@ endorf ( U@@ KE ) in a study .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to our estimates , 167 lung cancer cases are due to passive smoking per year , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said director Hei@@ ko Becher . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in comparison , he approached his own study on this subject of 1994 .
at that time , there were still 400 lung cancer deaths due to passive smoking in Germany .
the new study is published in the &quot; International Journal of Public Health . &quot;
domestic clas@@ ps prove to be very complex
the construction works in the Vill@@ inger Straße are in full swing and &quot; are reasonably in time , &quot; said the director of the site Fred Hein@@ ze .
in the area of the house connections , the situation is more complicated than assumed , as there is a lot of hide in the underground , which is not mentioned in the plans .
traffic , which is constantly obstruc@@ ting the construction work , represents a major problem for the construction of the company St@@ ump@@ p .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the ignorance of drivers from red lights and shut@@ ters is enormous , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reports Hein@@ ze . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the road was closed and only the regular buses were allowed for passage .
Angelo Car@@ us@@ o , Mar@@ vin Kost@@ or@@ z and Tim Kost@@ or@@ z from St@@ ump@@ p have been working on the bridge for weeks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the hot days were quite exhau@@ sting . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but fortunately we were supplied with a cool mineral water by our friend Fritz Matt , &quot; Mar@@ vin Kost@@ or@@ z explains .
poverty and Death in the Indonesian Gold Country
when Bar@@ d@@ ina De@@ ge@@ i coo@@ ks dinner , she does not use a stove .
it rarely uses a pot .
in her wooden house in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , the capital of the Pan@@ i@@ ai family in the un@@ troubled Indonesian province of Pap@@ ua , the house@@ wife usually den@@ otes a sweet potato - locally called &quot; not@@ a &quot; - directly in the fireplace .
after half an hour , the fo@@ al tu@@ ber is taken with eager , un@@ washed hands and swal@@ lowed .
De@@ ge@@ i sits on the clay soil - she has no furniture - where she also performs her daily work , e.g. washing clothes with glo@@ omy water from the nearby sw@@ amp .
a bucket in a homeless space serves as a lat@@ rine .
as the youngest of her husband &apos;s four wives , no fields were assigned to her .
poly@@ gam@@ y is common here .
of course it can be dangerous to work late : most village men are unemployed , and many drink heavy , and there are soldiers here .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nobody dar@@ es to run around after 5@@ pm in the village , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is a rare insight into the daily life in the high@@ lands of Pap@@ ua , a former Dutch colony , which was adopted in 1969 following a controversial referendum in Indonesia , when only 1,@@ 0@@ 26 elders were supposed to vote against the occup@@ ying forces by public raising .
an existing movement , which stir@@ red up the independence of the Dutch government , quickly turned against the government of Jak@@ arta , which maintains the control of the region and exclu@@ des foreign journalists or legal ob@@ servers .
in 2003 , the province was officially divided into Pap@@ ua and West Pap@@ ua , with the independent part of Pap@@ ua New Guinea that included the eastern part of the island .
the trip includes a 90 @-@ minute flight from the provincial capital of J@@ ay@@ ap@@ ura to Nab@@ ire , and then a morning 5 @-@ hour car with car rental .
there are no public transportation .
the city with about 19@@ ,000 inhabitants consists of wooden houses surrounded by bamboo @-@ f@@ ences , and made of corrugated iron roofs , which have been converted into different yellow @-@ brown tones through rust .
very few Indon@@ esi@@ ans have made their trip here , let alone journalists and practically no foreigners .
before Christian mission@@ aries arrived , Me@@ e P@@ ago Pap@@ ua worshipped God named U@@ ga Tam@@ ee .
there were also other changes .
&quot; we were not used to wear these clothes , &quot; says De@@ ge@@ i , and points to her vibrant hand @-@ woven tur@@ ban , her dark shirt and her light rock .
&quot; in the past we only had leaves on our bodies . &quot;
Pap@@ ua is Indonesia &apos;s poor@@ est province , where 28 % of people live under the poverty line and have some of the worst inf@@ ant mortality and liter@@ acy rates in Asia .
but it is also Indonesia &apos;s gold land .
the largest and most profitable gold mine in the world , Gras@@ berg , owned by Free@@ port Mc@@ Mor@@ an from Phoenix , lies only 60 miles from Pan@@ i@@ ai , a high@@ land province in the size of New Jersey with 15@@ 3,000 inhabitants .
in 2015 alone , Free@@ port has min@@ ed gold and copper in the value of 3.1 billion US dollars .
in addition , Pap@@ ua has estimated spending of 78 billion US dollars on wood resources .
however , these riches are a source of misery for the Pap@@ ua , ensuring that Indonesia &apos;s powerful military keeps a suff@@ oc@@ ating presence .
an investigation of 2005 in the New York Times reported that Free@@ port paid almost $ 20 million local military and units between 1998 and 2004 , including up to 15@@ 0,000 U.S. dollars to a single officer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pap@@ ua demands for greater autonomy thre@@ aten this golden go@@ ose and are treated mer@@ cil@@ essly . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to activists , more than 500@@ ,000 Pap@@ ua were killed and thousands have been ra@@ ped , tor@@ tured and imprisoned by the Indonesian military since 1969 .
mass kill@@ ings in Pap@@ ua &apos;s tribal land in the 1970 &quot; s became genocide in accordance with the Asian Human Rights Committee .
in the region alone , the Indonesian police arrested more than 3,@@ 900 peaceful demonstr@@ ators last year alone .
&quot; we Wer@@ den Every@@ thing &quot; means in a report from the year 2016 of the Arch@@ dioc@@ ese of Bris@@ ban@@ e , in which reports on atro@@ cities of the previous year are included , such as illegal exec@@ utions and torture - rape and electric sho@@ ot@@ ings are particularly popular after another report - and the brutal suppression of peaceful demonstrations .
&quot; it is difficult to count the number of victims since every week incidents happen , &quot; says Andreas Har@@ son@@ o , Indonesia researcher for Human Rights Watch .
the bolts increased , as Pap@@ ua &apos;s resources produce an influ@@ x of sett@@ lers from other parts of Indonesia .
the population of 3.5 million inhabitants of the province is up to 83 % Christian , but demographic development changes because Muslim economic migrants come from the popul@@ ous islands of Java , Bor@@ neo , Sum@@ atra and Sul@@ awes@@ i .
Jav@@ an@@ ese war@@ ung cant@@ e@@ ens sell roasted chicken and G@@ ado @-@ G@@ ado , a mixed vegetables with pe@@ an@@ ut sauce served .
local people are fighting to keep up with them .
&quot; the migrants have begun to sell chi@@ ckens and vegetables in the traditional market cheaper than the local Pap@@ ua , &quot; says A@@ bet@@ h You , a 24 @-@ year @-@ old Pan@@ i@@ ai local , who moved to work in the provincial capital of J@@ ay@@ ap@@ ura .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it has cost the native Pap@@ ua - the M@@ um M@@ om &#91; the women &#93; of Pap@@ ua - their market . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Indonesian President J@@ oko Wi@@ do@@ do , known as Jok@@ ow@@ ai during his campaign in 2014 , promised to address ine@@ qualities and violations of law in Pap@@ ua .
the former carp@@ enter secured 27 of the 29 districts of Pap@@ ua - including Pan@@ i@@ ai - on the way to the presidential palace in Jak@@ arta .
but in Pap@@ ua little has changed , and today the locals feel betra@@ yed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our hearts are broken because we have voted for Jok@@ ow@@ i in 2014 , believing that it will fulfill our hopes that justice will be restored , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says You . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in fact , Pan@@ i@@ ai suffered only two months after Jok@@ ow@@ is inauguration in October .
on December 7 , 2014 , a group of 11 children was outside and sang Christmas car@@ ols in front of a camp@@ fire in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , when two Indonesian soldiers broke through the darkness on a motorcycle .
the frigh@@ tened children told them that they should turn on their head@@ lights .
one of the soldiers ki@@ cked off their tone and later came back with four soldiers , so the local pastor Y@@ av@@ edt T@@ eb@@ ai .
the soldiers , who had drunk , pursued , and struck the group with their guns , and told the victims and witnesses .
then one of the soldiers fired into the group of children .
one child , 16 @-@ year @-@ old Y@@ uli@@ anus Y@@ ger@@ o , was so badly hit that he fell into a coma .
a few hours later , the building of the nearby government commission was set fire and things escal@@ ated the next day .
approximately 1,000 young Pap@@ ua men , women and children gathered at a football pitch in front of the local police station and the Military Command Center to demand justice .
they carried cerem@@ onial hunting bows and led the Wa@@ ita dance - in the circle constantly and im@@ it@@ ating a bir@@ d@@ song - from Pap@@ ua &apos;s Me@@ e P@@ ago tribe .
some demonstr@@ ators began to sling stones on police and military posts .
when the mood was heated up , the soldiers were sent a command over an internal radio : &quot; if the masses do more than three times , shoot them dead , &quot; says it in an official TI@@ ME document that was not released to the local media .
Y@@ er@@ em@@ ias Kay@@ ame , 56 , the leader of the K@@ ego K@@ oto quarter of En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , saw the im@@ pending danger and called for peace and called for the crowd to return home .
no one was able to listen to the mood .
&quot; when I turned around , I suddenly shot in my left wrist , &quot; he said TI@@ ME on the veranda of his colorful painted wooden house .
Kay@@ ams still doesn &apos;t know who fired , but says that the ball came from the ranks of the soldiers assembled here .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was crowded , many shots were fired , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he adds . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the native man Al@@ fi@@ us You@@ w was hit three times , so his cous@@ in , who witnessed the shooting .
&quot; I ran to him and examined his body to make sure he was it , &quot; said Y@@ oh@@ ane , who like many Indon@@ esi@@ ans only carries a name , the TI@@ ME in glo@@ omy mood .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I saw that he was dead ... I knew him . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the chief inspec@@ tor of the Pap@@ ua police , Y@@ ot@@ je M@@ ende , told repor@@ ters that his officers wanted to &quot; secure &quot; their station because they were attacked .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we must defend ourselves if people thre@@ aten to kill us , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the spokes@@ man of the Pap@@ ua police , Commissioner Pu@@ d@@ jo Su@@ li@@ sti@@ yo , in 2015 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; it is about life and death . &quot;
according to Human Rights Watch , five young demonstr@@ ators were killed and many others were injured .
the news on the kill@@ ings only came to Jak@@ arta the following day .
for three weeks , Jok@@ ow@@ i held a passionate speech in J@@ ay@@ ap@@ ura , in which he expressed sympathy for the families of the victims and s@@ wore to address the historical mis@@ fortun@@ es in Pap@@ ua .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I want this case to be solved immediately so that it will no longer happen in the future , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; security minister Wi@@ ran@@ to said in October 2016 that he set out an extra@@ judicial mechanism for the settlement of historical human rights violations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the exc@@ uses began almost immediately .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; most of the injuries have occurred a long time ago . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
some were in the 90 &apos;s and the beginning of the 2000 @-@ ies .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the point is that we have committed ourselves to tackl@@ ing these violations , but there are processes that must be passed through , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
then Wi@@ ran@@ to made a retreat when he spoke to TI@@ ME on 5 June in Jak@@ arta , saying that he had no plans to set up a complaint mechanism in Pap@@ ua .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; instead , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; everything is regulated by law , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot;
Wi@@ ran@@ to , whom the UN charged for &quot; crimes against humanity , &quot; which demanded more than 1,000 deaths in East Tim@@ ors of bloody independence from 1999 , said that 11 cases of human rights violations in Pap@@ ua were already included , including the Pan@@ i@@ ai incident .
Pan@@ i@@ ai victims families accepted such claims with fi@@ erc@@ ely dis@@ belief .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was inter@@ viewed four times over the last three years , but there was no progress , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Y@@ oh@@ anes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I &apos;m tired . &quot;
he says that he still lives in fear years later .
&quot; I am afraid , &quot; he says .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am afraid to be arrested by the military , afraid to be shot . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his brother Y@@ ac@@ ob@@ us repeated the view that people in Pan@@ i@@ ai are afraid to discuss the incident .
he says that he was beaten by the military after he helped to bury four of the victims .
&quot; after I had buried the dead , the military sought me , &quot; he says .
the sho@@ ot@@ ings have not ceased .
on Tuesday , the Indonesian police fired on vill@@ agers in Pan@@ i@@ ais neighborhood of Dei@@ y@@ ai .
during a confrontation between vill@@ agers and the manager of a construction company who refused to bring a un@@ conscious man to hospital , one person and 17 others were injured , including children .
the man , the 24 @-@ year @-@ old R@@ avi@@ anus Dou@@ w , who was drow@@ ned when he f@@ ished in a nearby river , died on the way to the hospital .
excited vill@@ agers prot@@ ested in front of the company &apos;s site .
the police said that the vill@@ agers threw stones on officers who responded by firing a warning .
but locals say that the mobile bri@@ g@@ ade ( Indonesian param@@ il@@ itary police ) began to shoot at the crowd and killed one .
&quot; we were so in panic , we are afraid that there will be ven@@ ge@@ ance , &quot; says the 29 @-@ year @-@ old Dom@@ ing@@ gu Ba@@ di@@ i , who lives near the hospital and witnessed how the injured had been delivered here quickly , such as the TI@@ ME .
&quot; I have hidden myself two days in my house . &quot;
the Dei@@ y@@ ai Parliament has called upon to take account of the officers involved and withdraw the mobile bri@@ g@@ ade of the police from the area .
Pan@@ i@@ ai was always a ru@@ dder for the Indonesian government .
the lack of meaningful development strengthens the dis@@ content of the family members Me@@ e , Mon@@ i , Dan@@ i and dam@@ al , who live in the green high@@ lands of Pap@@ ua .
many joined the Free Pap@@ ua Movement ( O@@ PM ) , the rebel army claiming to defend the rights of the Pap@@ ua by launching spor@@ adi@@ c attacks and kidn@@ app@@ ings of Indonesian soldiers .
some of the top O@@ PM leaders came from Pan@@ i@@ ai , including Ta@@ di@@ us Yo@@ gi and Daniel Yu@@ den Ko@@ go@@ ya .
in response to this , thousands of people in Pan@@ i@@ ai were arrested and arbitr@@ arily taken into custody under the pre@@ text of &quot; securing national sovereignty . &quot;
some never appear again .
among the people of Pap@@ ua , Pan@@ i@@ ai is known as &quot; a tragic , forgotten place . &quot;
poverty strengthens the dis@@ content .
the little rice sold in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali is too expensive for locals .
bread is just as out of reach .
the people here build everything they eat : especially not@@ a and fruit and leaf@@ y vegetables .
agriculture is the task of women who can process four or five fields of sweet potato each .
they keep most of the harvest for the family while the rest is sold on the local market .
ten pieces of Not@@ a cost only 10,000 Indonesian ru@@ pe@@ es ( 75 C@@ ents ) .
over time , economic ine@@ qualities have grown between the native Pap@@ ua and the new migrants who have arrived in greater numbers since the opening of new routes to the Nab@@ ire airport .
the few jobs in the region tend to go to the better educated and prosper@@ ous migrants .
Pap@@ ua rarely have capital or the necessary skills to make their own enterprises competitive .
&quot; young people are not interested in staying in the village ... for there are no jobs or money , &quot; says John Go@@ bai , head of Pan@@ i@@ ai &apos;s headquarters .
isolation keeps the eyes of the world far away from Pap@@ ua .
furthermore , restrictions on reporting on international media remain ten@@ se .
at the beginning of the year , French journalists Fran@@ ck Esc@@ u@@ die and Ba@@ sil@@ le Long@@ ch@@ amp were de@@ ported because of lack of coordination with related institutions from Pap@@ ua , although the rare permission to film was given to them .
according to P@@ hel@@ im K@@ ine , the deputy Asia director of Human Rights Watch , the promises of Jok@@ ow@@ is &apos;s campaign to raise the restrictions of reporting to promote transparency and development were not realized .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are new dangers for foreign journalists trying to report from Indonesia &apos;s un@@ troubled eastern provinces of Pap@@ ua and West Pap@@ ua : visa refusal and a black list , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in an explanation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
lack of press control means that the international pressure on the Indonesian government is largely restricted to the immediate neighbours of Pap@@ ua .
in March , six Pacific states - Ton@@ ga , Nau@@ ru , Palau , Tu@@ val@@ u , the Marshall Islands and the Solomon Islands - called on the UN Human Rights Council to investigate the &quot; various and widespread violations &quot; in Pap@@ ua including Pan@@ i@@ ai shooting .
the same countries have historically regarded the O@@ PM .
the spokes@@ man of the Indonesian Foreign Ministry Ar@@ r@@ man@@ ath@@ a N@@ asi@@ r rejected the group &apos;s alleg@@ ations and said journalists in Jak@@ arta : &quot; in Indonesia there is still a democratic system , and there are free media so it is difficult to cover the evidence of human rights cases . &quot;
local people want more foreign governments to take note of this .
when an official delegation from the Netherlands , under the direction of the human right ambassador K@@ ees Van Ba@@ ar , visited J@@ ay@@ ap@@ ura on May 4 , natives broke their silence and urged him &quot; We want freedom , &quot; according to a source , which also participated in the meeting , but would remain anonymous .
Indonesia has another presidential election in 2019 but the Pap@@ ua says that they probably won &apos;t be able to vote for Jok@@ ow@@ i again .
&quot; Jok@@ ow@@ i is a person who has good intentions , but it is surrounded by the people involved in the Pan@@ i@@ ai shots , &quot; says Go@@ bai , Chairman of the tribal council .
he wants the Pan@@ i@@ ai people to know that the Pan@@ i@@ ai people , apart from being under the constant threat of a pre@@ dat@@ ory military , are in poor educational and health services .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Go@@ bai is saying that the Pan@@ i@@ ai people , like other Pap@@ ua , consider their voice to be a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; guilt &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that he has to pay back . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they don &apos;t need money , they only want justice , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
despite the threats and in@@ timi@@ dation , families of the Pan@@ i@@ ai shot victims made a last symbolic act of de@@ fi@@ ance : the cor@@ p@@ se of an victim was buried on a property right in front of the police and the military station .
they know that they may never give justice to them , but at least they do not forget those responsible for their crimes .

fire Coll@@ ects the &apos; Tor@@ ch &apos; sky@@ scra@@ per from Dubai for the second time
a fire took place on Friday in one of the world &apos;s highest residential towers in Dubai , forcing hundreds of residents to flee from the 3@@ 37 @-@ metre @-@ high 79 @-@ storey building .
it is the second fire that swe@@ eps through the high @-@ rise in just two years , which is accidentally called the Tor@@ ch Tower ( tor@@ ches tower ) .
the building was ev@@ acu@@ ated , injuries were not reported , and there was no direct word about the cause of the flame .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we slept and we got up with the fire alarm and at the cry of the people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we ran down the stairs and it took about 10 minutes to come down from the 50@@ th floor , &quot; said a resident who named George An@@ ab , Reu@@ ters .
Du@@ ba@@ is &apos;s civil protection authorities said that fighting fires at 4.@@ 00 o &apos;clock local time ( 00@@ .@@ 00 GMT ) extingu@@ ished the fire and cooled the building .
the government said they are working on providing accommodation for those affected .
the incident can revi@@ ve issues relating to the safety of materials used in outdoor areas of high @-@ rise buildings all over the world .
an investigation by the management of the Tor@@ ch building after its fire in 2015 revealed that most of the damage occurred from facing , exterior cl@@ adding for decoration or insulation .
in Britain , the police said they believe that the system of plates for insulation and cl@@ adding in London &apos;s Gren@@ fell Tower could have contributed to the rapid spread of a fire in June , where about 80 people died .
no Davis Cup reform : further Best @-@ of @-@ five
the president of the International Tennis Federation ( IT@@ F ) has gone through with his large Davis Cup coup at the Annual General Meeting .
at the meeting in Ho Chi Min@@ h City , the revolutionary suggestion for this sport was to play Davis Cup single only on two competitions , spar@@ sely not supported by the required two @-@ thirds majority .
the five @-@ set classics which are often very long , but also very much appreciated , are thus preserved to the traditional competition .
6@@ 3.@@ 54 % of member countries voted for the reform , the aim of IT@@ F President David Hag@@ ger@@ ty was therefore only scar@@ c@@ ely missed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we respect this decision but are disappointed that our member nations did not accept the entire reform package for the Davis Cup and F@@ ed Cup . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need a change to secure the long @-@ term future of these iconic and historical challenges , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Hag@@ ger@@ ty . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
you will continue to work to improve the application .
it was not until the vote that the proposal had come to a neutral location after a lot of in@@ consist@@ encies .
new from 2018 are only comparatively minor details : in the next round , the fin@@ alists in the Davis Cup and F@@ ed Cup will have the host @-@ right in the next round .
in order to reduce the costs of the organizers , the requirements for training places etc. are facilit@@ ated and players will have to complete less official media appointments before the Davis Cup .
more than 1 out of 5 US travelers bringing banned items into the aircraft , finding out a survey
a survey among passengers showed that more than 20 percent of un@@ intentionally forbidden objects were s@@ mu@@ g@@ gled by the US Transportation Security Administration &apos;s check@@ points , including at least 6 percent of the aircraft be@@ ck@@ oning , while they accidentally bore forbidden blades or other items with blades .
less than 1 per cent claimed they had late discovered that they had gone wrong with guns , amm@@ uni@@ tion or explo@@ sives .
the survey with more than 1,000 people - which was conducted by a jet charter service , the Str@@ at@@ os Jet Char@@ ters Inc . , also stated that younger travellers rather dis@@ regard the rules .
the respon@@ dents who admitted that they were know@@ ingly trying to fly with something that was forbidden by the T@@ SA were 19.@@ 7 percent mill@@ enni@@ als compared to less than 15 percent , the members of Generation X .
the most common objects that were intentionally passed by T@@ SA agents were food and liquids .
more than 3 percent agreed to have know@@ ingly carried objects with blades through security control , while 2.2 percent of female respon@@ dents and 3.7 percent of the male respon@@ dents confirmed that they had intentionally brought illegal drugs into the plane .
the company said that it questioned travellers all over the country to find out how many mistakenly sent s@@ mu@@ g@@ gled goods through airport security and how many had done it intentionally .
it is no surprise that people who are most likely s@@ mu@@ g@@ gling - know@@ ingly or unknow@@ ingly - wear safety , those who are most frequently flying .
the company , however , points out that the T@@ SA guidelines are a bit complicated and conf@@ using .
people are often unsure which liquids they are allowed to take with or how much of them .
therefore , there is no surprise that the bulk of the objects conf@@ is@@ cated by the T@@ SA are forbidden fluids .
for a while , the people thought T@@ SA could look at books as s@@ mu@@ g@@ gling ware .
liquids are allowed on domestic flights , but not on international flights .
El@@ on Mus@@ k is no matter : tens of thousands of Tes@@ la customers cancel order
Elec@@ tro @-@ Taus@@ end@@ s@@ ass@@ a El@@ on Mus@@ k likes to give up with the huge number of pre @-@ orders for his new Tes@@ la Model 3 .
he has so far under@@ lined that a part of the customers has withdrawn their legally binding reservation .
in addition to the ever trium@@ ph@@ ant figures on sales increases and even more gigantic sales targets , Tes@@ la CEO El@@ on Mus@@ k has for the first time betra@@ yed a different , less gl@@ amor@@ ous number : the cancellation of the new mass market model 3 .
during the past few months , Mus@@ k frequently had more than 500@@ ,000 pre @-@ orders for the new car , whose delivery has just begun .
now , Mus@@ k cle@@ ars : 6@@ 3,000 had already been withdrawn from the total of 5@@ 18@@ ,000 pre @-@ orders .
critics have always indicated that they are merely non @-@ binding reservations .
in case of cancellation Tes@@ la pays the 1000 Euro ( in the U.S. 1000 US dollars and in Great Britain 1000 Po@@ unds ) &quot; reservation payment . &quot;
at present 45@@ ,000 such non @-@ binding reservations envis@@ age that Mus@@ k took part in a telephone conference with analysts .
however , the Tes@@ la boss does not believe that the cancellation of up to twelve percent of all orders could become a problem .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; his argument : the challenge with the ambitious growth targets is not in demand , but on the production side . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
last year , Tes@@ la delivered 8@@ 4,000 vehicles .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in 2018 it will be - all models - 500@@ ,000 , 2020 a million . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the demand for this is obvious .
according to Mus@@ k there are currently 1800 reservations per day .
anyone who orders a &quot; Model 3 &quot; today may expect delivery at the earliest in the second half of 2018 - when Tes@@ la manages to drive his brand @-@ new production lines that have never been tested in practice without major interrup@@ tions with maximum capacity utilization .
many experts doubt that this is possible .
but if it comes to major delays , then the liability of the reservations may become a problem for Tes@@ la .
because then the company cannot prevent dis@@ satisfied customers from running in dro@@ ves .
EPA manager P@@ ru@@ itt re@@ pul@@ ls due to the delay of the Obama @-@ Er@@ a rules to reduce emissions
one day after having been accused by 15 states , Scott P@@ ru@@ itt , the chief of the environmental protection authority , took his earlier decision to delay the implementation of the Obama era rules in order to reduce emissions smo@@ g causing pollutants .
P@@ ru@@ itt presented the change as his agency turned out to be responsive to the needs of state @-@ of @-@ the @-@ art environmental authorities more responsive than previous administr@@ ations .
he did not mention the complaint filed against his previous position in a Federal Court of App@@ eal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a term that ran for states on 1 October to comply with the 2015 standards for bot@@ tom@@ less o@@ zone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
P@@ ru@@ itt announced in June that he would delay adher@@ ence to a year in order to give his authority more time to study the plan and to avoid interfer@@ ing with local decisions or to im@@ pe@@ de economic growth . &quot;
P@@ ru@@ itt , who before being appointed by President Donald Tr@@ ump At@@ tor@@ ney General of O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma , was a reliable opponent of stric@@ ter environmental protection regulations for a long time .
since its arrival in Washington , P@@ ru@@ itt has repeatedly passed over to block or delay regulations , which oppose the chemical industry and the industry of fossil fuels .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the sudden revers@@ al of Wednesday is the latest legal set@@ back for the P@@ ru@@ denti@@ al Roll@@ back Agenda . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
last month , a Federal Employment Court in Washington decided that the EPA administrator exceeded his authority when he tried to delay the implementation of a rule of the Obama administration that obliged oil and gas companies to monitor and reduce methane leak@@ age .
in an opinion published on Wednesday evening , P@@ ru@@ itt suggested that his revers@@ al at o@@ zone standards was simply the willingness of the EP@@ O to cooperate with States through the complex process of timely fulfillment of the new standards .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; under previous administr@@ ations , the EPA has often failed to comply with dead@@ lines and then wait to be charged by activ@@ ist groups and others , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said P@@ ru@@ itt , who compl@@ ained the EPA for more than a dozen times in his previous job . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we do not believe in regulation through court proceedings , and we take dead@@ lines seriously . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we also take the law and the authority we give . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , the EPA comments that P@@ ru@@ itt will eventually use his &quot; authority to delay and all other legally available powers &quot; to ensure that the rules are based on a solid policy and the best available information . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Republi@@ cans in Congress are pushing for a more comprehensive collection of o@@ zone rules . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a law approved last month is intended to delay the implementation of the 2015 rules by at least eight years .
the measure has not yet been set up in the Senate .
the New York General At@@ tor@@ ney Eric Schnei@@ der@@ man , who led the coalition of states that the EPA announced this week , said the group intends to maintain the legal pressure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the revers@@ al of EPA - according to our complaints - is an important gain for health and safety of these 6.@@ 7 million New Yor@@ kers and the more than 115 million Americans who are directly affected by the smo@@ g that flows into their communities , &quot; said Schnei@@ der@@ man .
new York concluded in this case California , Connec@@ tic@@ ut , Del@@ aware , Illinois , I@@ owa , Ma@@ ine , Massachusetts , Minn@@ es@@ ota , New Mexico , Oregon , Penn@@ syl@@ van@@ ia , Rho@@ de Island , Ver@@ mont and Washington and the District of Columbia .
soil @-@ Oz@@ on occurs when pollutants from cars , power plants , oil refin@@ eries , chemical plants and other sources react in the atmosphere to sunlight .
the resulting smo@@ g may cause serious breathing problems in sensitive groups of people , and every year thousands of premature deaths contribute .
representatives of public health care and environ@@ ment@@ alists che@@ ered over P@@ ru@@ itt &apos;s surprising exchange of courses .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is disturbing how much pressure it takes to keep this sensible step from the responsible for the protection of the air we breathe , &quot; said Lor@@ i An@@ n Bur@@ d from the Center for Bi@@ ological Di@@ versity .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we must continue to fight against the ideological crus@@ ade of the Tr@@ ump government to address environmental pollution and its special interests . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
tum@@ ors celebrates 750 years of St. Hil@@ arius Church
750 years of St. Hil@@ arius Church : on the occasion of the anniversary of the Berg@@ kirche the old cemetery area in Tum@@ lingen will be invited to a Ser@@ en@@ ade on Sunday , 16 July .
whether its idyllic location and beautiful views of the village , the historic St. Hil@@ arius facility is a popular place to stay .
visitors of the sixth benefit @-@ ser@@ en@@ ade can be en@@ chan@@ ted by this powerful place .
the rescue and preservation of the oldest building in the village have made the friends and suppor@@ ter Tum@@ arc their concern .
Walter Mart@@ ini stresses : &quot; it is a unique village gem . &quot;
in 12@@ 67 the St. Hil@@ ary Chapel was first mentioned in the Württem@@ berg@@ ischer Ur@@ customised Book : count Hermann von Sul@@ z &quot; sold the mountain with the parish church to Tum@@ ski and the &quot; Vo@@ g@@ tei &quot; at Magi@@ ster Eber@@ hard von Hor@@ b and his brother Dietrich for 20 Mark silver .
according to the wording of the certificate , on the Tum@@ linger Berg , besides the former parish church , there was also a beautiful courtyard , which belonged to the church or the patron and not the other way round .
so there were people there .
as described in the description of the Ober@@ am@@ tes Freu@@ den@@ stadt from 18@@ 58 , beside the Unter@@ dorf and the upper village , which are still visible today in the outskirts of Tum@@ ski , the &quot; mountain &quot; is the third , the beautiful settlement nucle@@ us of the village .
old maps from the time around 1600 substanti@@ ate these historical circumstances .
the right of pat@@ ron@@ age arose from the early medieval church law .
a gent@@ leman who built a church and occupied with a priest remained the owner of this church and could also inherit this church .
associated with this was the right to use a priest or to propose a new priest to the bishop .
there were three altars in the church and two bells on the tower .
the Gre@@ at@@ est of the two de@@ parts at Christmas 16@@ 73 .
the newly created bell sounded for the first time in 16@@ 92 , but had to be delivered later in the Second World War in 1942 .
in the Thi@@ r@@ ty Years &apos; War ( 16@@ 16 @-@ 16@@ 48 ) the window pan@@ es were inserted and the bells were stolen .
the roof was leak@@ y .
in 17@@ 96 French troops camped near the church .
they broke out the pul@@ pit and church chairs and used them as fire@@ wood .
the remains of the church threatened to collapse in 18@@ 09 .
until 18@@ 69 the Tum@@ linger Hil@@ arius cemetery served as the last resting place for the dead from audi@@ tors .
in 18@@ 23 the cemetery was enlarged and the church was demoli@@ shed .
only the church tower was stopped .
during the New Year &apos;s Eve in 18@@ 34 a storm broke the church tower and half collap@@ sed .
to prevent mis@@ fortune , the tower was demoli@@ shed .
only the tower still existing today was preserved as a witness of the 750 years old church history .
today Horst K@@ allen@@ berger and Rolf @-@ Dieter Was@@ n are cultiv@@ ating the Hil@@ arius system from the &quot; Schaff@@ ner pen@@ sion@@ ers &quot; as the successor of Dieter Do@@ ck@@ horn .
as organis@@ ers , the friends and promot@@ er Tum@@ arc invite the sixth Ser@@ en@@ ade to the old cemetery to the St. Hil@@ ary Chapel on Sunday , 16 July .
it is designed by the Com@@ bo of the Freu@@ den@@ stadt @-@ Gymnasium and with contributions from Kurt Kü@@ bler and Rein@@ hold Mat@@ tei@@ s .
Hart@@ mut Rom@@ ann , the local leader , speaks the final word .
the program starts at 4.@@ 30 p.m .
admission is from 3.@@ 30 pm .
at the end of the Ser@@ en@@ ade a drink takes place in front of the cemetery .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; enjoy a summer evening under the shade of old trees and with the wide view over meadows to the forest , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the organizers present the fantastic view . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Ser@@ en@@ ade takes place only in dry weather .
the organizers are hoping for many supporters for the preservation of the historic St. Hil@@ arius plant , which is of importance for tum@@ ors and hearing wel@@ ders .
the friends and supporters of the Tum@@ arc are particularly committed to the home care , like Ser@@ en@@ ade organis@@ er Walter Mart@@ ini re@@ affir@@ med .
association wants to check approval of wind turbines
&quot; Bo@@ is@@ heim conduc@@ ts himself &quot; does not see a legal requirement for the construction and therefore has turned to the coun@@ cill@@ or .
the &quot; Bo@@ is@@ heim we@@ ars &quot; association called on Land@@ council Andreas Co@@ enen ( CD@@ U ) to take back his approval for the construction of planned wind turbines in the Bo@@ is@@ heim N@@ ette .
it is un@@ lawful .
the association ar@@ gues that at the time of approval on 30 December 2016 , no wind turbines could have been approved at the Bo@@ is@@ heimer N@@ ette , as at the time in Vier@@ sen there existed only at the border to Sch@@ wal@@ m@@ tal a wind force concentration zone .
within this concentration zone , the construction and operation of wind turbines is generally possible , but at the same time the concentration zone causes the elimination of the use of wind energy for the rest of the city .
such zones are intended to prevent a &quot; rec@@ ess &quot; of the landscape .
the city of Vier@@ sen had decided on a second wind turbine concentration zone in the Bo@@ is@@ heimer N@@ ette a few days earlier , but it did not appro@@ ve the district government of Düsseldorf because of a deformation error .
&quot; according to Christoph Er@@ k@@ ens , president of Bo@@ is@@ heim , &quot; the lack of planning permission is still un@@ lawful and therefore also to take back , &quot; said Christoph Er@@ k@@ ens .
state of affairs : the City Council once again decided on the wind concentration zone in the Bo@@ is@@ heimer n@@ ette in front of the summer break ; a permit from the district government is still pending .
Er@@ k@@ ens : &quot; at this point , the issu@@ ance of a permit for the establishment of wind turbines is legally excluded . &quot;
the circle confirms the entrance of the invitation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the relevant letter has been received by Vier@@ sen since last week , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a spokes@@ man . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the circle takes them to the occasion to re @-@ examine the matter .
however , they do not expect the procedure to be stopped .
in view of ongoing proceedings at the Administr@@ ative Court , the circle on Thursday did not want to comment on the arguments of the association Bo@@ is@@ heim .
the NEW Re , a subsidiary of the NEW , plans to build four 200 @-@ metre @-@ high wind turbines on an area at the Bo@@ is@@ heimer N@@ ette .
last year , the company , in which the city Vier@@ sen is indirectly involved , closed lease contracts with the owner of about 65 hectares of land .
with the construction of the four wind turbines , the electricity demand should be covered by around 11 400 households - this corresponds to about one fifth of the electricity needs of all four @-@ leg@@ ged households .
the NEW Re wants to invest some 20 million euros .
last summer , Vier@@ sen City Council gave the green light to the purchase of three wind turbines in the Lin@@ ni@@ ch wind park near Aachen as well as a participation in a wind power plant in Ü@@ bach @-@ Pal@@ enberg in the district Hein@@ sberg .
car and tractor crash together : woman dies in terrible accident
a terrible road accident occurred on Friday morning at 10 o &apos;clock on the L 3@@ 33 between Nieder@@ wall@@ men@@ ach and Bo@@ gel ( Rhine @-@ L@@ ahn @-@ Kreis ) .
a woman was injured in the process .
two other persons were easily injured .
the state road stopped for hours .
according to police data , a 17 @-@ year @-@ old young woman from Bor@@ ni@@ ch with her car travelled to Bo@@ gel with her 53 @-@ year @-@ old mother as an es@@ cor@@ t with her 53 @-@ year @-@ old mother .
city and dealer plan &quot; home shopping &quot; weekend
bad Lan@@ gen@@ sal@@ a@@ er and people from the region are to re@@ discover shopping in the city centre in September .
the business association and the city administration want to take advantage of the weekend on September 8 and 9 in order to enti@@ ce the inhabitants to the shopping m@@ alls in the city centre .
as the chairman of the commercial association , Christian König , announced , the &quot; home shopping &quot; weekend will make customers aware of what offers their own city is located away from the usual supermarket merchandise .
accordingly , a market with regional companies is planned , similar to the weekly market .
in addition , local firms should present themselves with their training places .
in addition , the shops of the city centre are to invite &quot; Mit@@ ter@@ nights @-@ Sh@@ opp@@ ure . &quot;
the campaign aims not only to residents of the city and the region .
in preparation are commerci@@ als on the radio , an internet video and printed bags that point to the action weekend , so Christian König .
the municipal administration and the commercial association cooperate with the Chamber of Commerce and Industry .
thus the commercial association and the city go to another stage of the project &quot; Attrac@@ tive downtown . &quot;
these include new offerings such as the first &quot; active day &quot; to the well @-@ known well and selling Sunday , talks with all the tra@@ des@@ men and hosts , in order to move them to active participation .
attractive offers on Saturday and the wai@@ ver of parking fees on that day are part of the concept .
in addition , customer potentials are to be re @-@ opened or re @-@ opened .
these include spa guests and tourists .
but also many locals would have lost the city center while shopping .
in the end , everyone would have to contribute to li@@ ven the city centre - to land@@ lords , the factories of the whole city and clubs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was worth overcoming the le@@ th@@ ar@@ gy with a network that took part , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said King in the spring . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Bir@@ git St@@ reich , head of the Chamber of Commerce and Industry in Müh@@ l@@ hausen , announced that the third &quot; home @-@ shopping &quot; day , the first five Thur@@ in@@ gian cities , took part in the country &apos;s third &quot; home @-@ shopping &quot; day .
in addition to Bad Lan@@ gen@@ sal@@ za , this is Weimar , S@@ ö@@ mmer@@ da , Hei@@ ligen@@ stadt and B@@ leich@@ ero@@ de .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the day should &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; promote &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the appreciation of local trade and strengthen its significance for the common good of our cities , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says St@@ reich . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the action under the leadership of the Chamber of Commerce of the Chamber of Commerce and with many partners also makes it clear that every citizen with his buying behaviour can influence his direct environment himself . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
two dead and several wounded after explosion at U.S. school
construction work resulted in a gas explosion in the school building .
new people were injured .

Tr@@ ump suspended after le@@ aked tran@@ scrip@@ tions of phone calls Mexico under pressure due to the payment of the boundary wall
telephone calls between US President Donald Tr@@ ump and leaders of Mexico and Australia were published by the Washington Post .
on 27 January , Tr@@ ump requested to stop in a telephone conversation with Mexican President En@@ rique Pen@@ a N@@ ie@@ to , to publicly say that he would not pay for a planned boundary wall .
the US president appe@@ aled to him because he had publicly den@@ ounced the wall . according to reports , he said to him , &quot; You can &apos;t tell the press . &quot;
Tr@@ ump started his presidential campaign with the promise to build a wall at the southern border of the USA , and s@@ wore to let Mexico pay for the project .
the tran@@ scripts of his first call with the Australian Prime Minister Mal@@ col@@ m Turn@@ bull have also been published and revealed a ten@@ se exchange .
Mr. Tr@@ ump told Mr. Turn@@ bull that a trade for the US would be &quot; laugh@@ able , &quot; &quot; bad &quot; and &quot; stupid &quot; and that the existence on the trade that was im@@ par@@ ted by the Obama administration would look like a &quot; Dep@@ p &quot; after he had proposed a ban on the reloc@@ ation of refugees to the United States .
Mr. Tr@@ ump completed the call after he had told Mr. Turn@@ bull &quot; that &apos;s the most unpleasant call for the whole day . &quot;
mo@@ ores Ford massacre : activists resume rac@@ ist ly@@ n@@ ching act as a call for justice
a 1948 @-@ based Ford Mer@@ cury passed through a group of spectators in the Mon@@ ro@@ e countryside , Georgia , and moved to the Ford bridge of Mo@@ ore .
before the car , which had four black passengers and a white driver , could reach the bridge , a group of white men with ri@@ fl@@ es emerged to block his way .
the leader of the mo@@ b - a middle @-@ aged man in a con@@ i@@ fer suit - took a long train at his ci@@ gar and looked at the wind@@ screen .
in@@ doors the in@@ mates suspended in fear .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want this n --@@ -- r Roger ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the man ro@@ ared . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; get him out of the car ! &quot;
cri@@ es broke the silence when a young black man was dra@@ gged from the passenger seat .
fortunately , this horri@@ ble scene , played on July 22nd , is just a reflection .
but when a loop is tos@@ sed around the neck of &quot; Roger , &quot; almost everyone in the audience ki@@ cked off very real si@@ ghs .
since 2005 , citizens rights activists have come back to the Mo@@ ore &apos;s Ford Bridge to mim@@ ic the night in which two black couples - Roger and Dor@@ othy Mal@@ com , and George and Ma@@ e Mur@@ ray Dor@@ sey - were treated by K@@ u Klu@@ x Kl@@ an in 1946 .
no one was ever accused of murder .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is really unbelievable that in all these years no single person was arrested - although we see them in our churches , although we know who they are , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ty@@ rone Broo@@ ks who helps organizing the post @-@ ordination . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a dirty spot on a story , but it is a burden for our souls . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Broo@@ ks is a 71 @-@ year @-@ old former Con@@ gres@@ s@@ man of Georgia State and a life @-@ long civil rights activ@@ ist .
for him , the post @-@ employment serves as a dramatic call to action and represents an annual reminder of the Mon@@ ro@@ e community that an injustice has never been corrected .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to prosec@@ ute , we want the end , we want healing , we want reconciliation , but first we must receive justice , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we cannot get to heal and reconciliation until we receive righteousness . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a bai@@ li@@ ff puts a sheet on the body of one of the victims of the Mo@@ ore @-@ Ford @-@ Lyn@@ ching on 27 July 1946 .
according to FB@@ I files received by the N@@ BC News , more than 50 men from Mon@@ ro@@ e and the surrounding coun@@ ties were suspected in the ly@@ n@@ ching process .
but no one was ever accused .
although the susp@@ ects remain free on foot for decades , civil rights activists say that the double motivation for the Lyn@@ ch actions throughout the city was always known : politics and sex .
in April 1946 , a decision by the Supreme Court of Justice in Georgia enabled the black citizens in Georgia to vote for their vote for the first time in the summer .
approximately at the same time as the election st@@ ach according to the FB@@ I the black farmer Roger Mal@@ com , a white land@@ owner , Bar@@ nett H@@ ester , down during a fight - allegedly because of a woman .
Broo@@ ks said that the rum@@ or in the city had been that H@@ ester had slept with Mal@@ com@@ s &apos;s wife Dor@@ othy and that the baby she wore did not come from her husband .
on 25 July 1946 , Lo@@ y Har@@ rison , a prominent white land@@ owner , paid 600 dollars to free Mal@@ com from prison , such as the FB@@ I .
he was accompanied by Dor@@ othy and her cous@@ ins Ma@@ e Mur@@ ray and George Dor@@ sey .
but when they came out of the prison and approached the Mo@@ ore &apos;s Ford Bridge , a Lyn@@ ch@@ mo@@ b surrounded the car .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as it turns out , Har@@ rison , who has prepared and ordered the kill@@ ings , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; conclu@@ des an FB@@ I report . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is also obvious that there was a conspiracy between national and local prosecution , which was not only involved in the kill@@ ings , removing evidence and obsc@@ ured the identity of witnesses . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Broo@@ ks puts it even more conc@@ ise .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; electoral law massacre &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they were all killed to send a message to black people in this community : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you register and if you vote , this will happen here . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for almost a decade , Cass@@ andra Gre@@ ene has conducted the annual install@@ ment of the Mo@@ ore Ford Bridge Lyn@@ ch @-@ Mor@@ de .
her presentation is illustr@@ ative , po@@ ign@@ ant and is based on a kind of deep rac@@ ism , many of whom want to believe that he no longer exists in America .
it is hard to watch , and more difficult to look away , but Gre@@ ene said that this is the point .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we don &apos;t want to talk about the Lyn@@ ch because we are confronted with the ug@@ liness in all of us , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; but I can &apos;t build a relationship with you if you don &apos;t want to listen to me or don &apos;t want to hear what I &apos;ve been going through . &quot;
rehear@@ s@@ als for this year &apos;s production began in June , and on the first day almost 30 actors - a dozen wh@@ ites and the rest of the black - pushed into a room and listened as Gre@@ ene started a well @-@ rehear@@ sed view of the piece .
W@@ ade Mar@@ bau@@ gh is a co @-@ director here .
he has played the role of chief @-@ member member for years , but he said that the role will never be easier .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I feel dirty because I &apos;m not that way , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mar@@ bau@@ gh . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I think it is very important to keep this story alive because we don &apos;t want to return to these times . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the other side of the room , actors Dar@@ rius Brad@@ sh@@ aw and Nick Ras@@ cona , who play Roger Mal@@ com and Bar@@ nett H@@ ester , rehear@@ sed their lines .
the piece begins with Mal@@ com , who scre@@ ams H@@ ester and pus@@ hes him out , fur@@ i@@ ously that he slept with his wife Dor@@ othy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he , swe@@ pt away from my property ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the fire is reci@@ proc@@ ated by Ras@@ cona .
there is a break .
and then everyone ( at least all black actors ) breaks out in laughter .
Gre@@ ene laughs at the lou@@ dest .
&quot; what ? ! , &quot; said Ras@@ cona .
he is al@@ armed and confused .
was I too hard ?
&quot; no , &quot; Gre@@ ene said , still chu@@ ck@@ ling .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I simply don &apos;t think that white people at that time &apos; n --- he &apos; said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wit@@ ched one of the other black performers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; you just have to hit the hard &apos; R. &apos; .
and exactly there the energy shifts in space , a feeling of compan@@ i@@ onship replaces the discomfort .
everyone is busy getting this right , not only because of the game , but also because of the memory of the four killed people .
the scene starts again .
this time when An@@ cona is saying the N word , he says it sharply and with im@@ print .
absolutely nobody laughs .
this repeti@@ tion ends violent and fast .
there are scre@@ ams , shots and then silence .
a woman , dressed in mour@@ ning , stands above the cor@@ p@@ ses of the actors and performs Bil@@ lie holidays mour@@ ning pra@@ ises &quot; St@@ range Fruit . &quot;
her voice breaks with every second word .
about a hundred meters behind it caught a group of about four dozen spectators sweat and tears from the eyes .
the audience is almost uni@@ form@@ ly divided between black and white .
one pair came from I@@ th@@ aca , New York , to see the performance , many come down only the street .
they have experienced Geor@@ gy &apos;s oppres@@ sive moisture for almost eight hours when Broo@@ ks leads them on a pilgrimage to the bur@@ ial places of the Mal@@ com@@ s and Dor@@ se@@ ys .
up to this point the kill@@ ings have remained an an@@ ec@@ d@@ ote , but now , if one stands in the same country where the Lyn@@ ch mor@@ de took place , the air feels sp@@ ook@@ y .
when the last notes of the song sound , Gre@@ ene is inviting the crowd to come closer and inspect the body &apos;s name .
children sit on their heads , register the fake blood and the silent bodies and whis@@ per each other .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they are not really dead , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mur@@ m@@ urs a little boy as if he wanted to remember . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after a few minutes Gre@@ ene ow@@ es the crowd - and suddenly it &apos;s over .
the actors throw away the ly@@ n@@ ch and wipe their tears off .
Brad@@ sh@@ aw hu@@ gs Mar@@ bau@@ gh , the man in the suit , who played the member of the cl@@ an .
Nick Ras@@ cona embra@@ ces two of his fellow players and then breaks down in her arms , the emotional burden of the performance finally breaks with him .
&quot; it &apos;s okay , &quot; one of the women whis@@ pers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we know that this is not in your heart . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you did that for one reason . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
later the audience joins together with the actors for dinner .
at a table a white pair of Atlanta is chat@@ ting about the post@@ age with a black pair they just got to know .
Den@@ ise Du@@ pl@@ inski is struggling to find words which feel the performance has left .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s hard to hear these terrible words and deeds ... coming from people who look like you themselves and who do it because they look like you , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what this really does with me makes me believe that the Lyn@@ x is still going on , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she added , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today it is called police shooting . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the same room Ty@@ rone Broo@@ ks Hof goes to his table , he eats and rec@@ alls the ci@@ vic rights .
he said he already started planning the performance next year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the demand is in some ways inspiring , as it describes the hor@@ r@@ ors of what we have endu@@ red , but it is also a moment of learning , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s like we don &apos;t learn from it , then it can happen again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
whoever does not study his own history , who does not know his own history , is condemned to repeat them . &quot;
&quot; Göt@@ ter@@ dämm@@ erung &quot; reconc@@ iled the W@@ agn@@ eri@@ an in Bayreuth
in the fourth part of Richard Wagner &apos;s monumental work , director Frank Cast@@ orf will stage a colorful @-@ fri@@ vol@@ ous st@@ aging in front of a gigantic six @-@ story cou@@ li@@ sse .
the revol@@ ving platform ( designed by A@@ lek@@ sand@@ ar D@@ EN@@ IC ) shows either a sh@@ ab@@ by street corner together with the Wall and D@@ ön@@ er@@ bu@@ de in Berlin , a &quot; Pla@@ ste and Ela@@ ste &quot; logo from G@@ DR times or the New York Stock Exchange .
in front of it , an open Mercedes classic car , in which the Rhine bo@@ ars pose as a rock ergi@@ r@@ ls , or alternatively an Is@@ etta .
stack@@ ed oil drums are reminiscent of Cast@@ or@@ fs &apos;s leit@@ motif - money , power and gre@@ ed - that goes through his &quot; ring &quot; st@@ aging .
the three Rhein@@ gold daughters - sung by Stephan@@ ie Hou@@ tz@@ el , Wi@@ eb@@ ke Leh@@ m@@ ku@@ hl and Alexandra St@@ einer - are in harmony with &quot; Rhein@@ gold . &quot;
K@@ ES@@ S seduc@@ es them Siegfried ( Stefan Vin@@ ke ) , breaks a cor@@ p@@ se into the trunk in Hollywood @-@ style and give the Kra@@ wall@@ o @-@ cli@@ que .
Stephen Mill@@ ing sings the wonderfully nasty Hagen that surrounds the aura of a gravity box@@ er .
brutal the scene when he s@@ miles Siegfried .
later Gun@@ ther ( Markus oak ) still has to believe it .
the audience thanks it to the ensemble with strong applause .
fo@@ ster , Mill@@ ing , Vin@@ ke and conductor Jan@@ owski are being celebrated in a stor@@ my way , which is modest and the hands to Merkel @-@ Rau@@ te form@@ ulate .
there is a big applause for the Festival Orchestra , which shows itself on stage for the first time - in view of the great heat again in casual leisure wear .
the performance of Frank Cast@@ orf and his team was eag@@ erly awa@@ ited .
in 2013 he had to let go of the pipe concert , and five years later , there was a great che@@ ering in which the scattered &quot; bu@@ h &quot; calls went down .
Fest@@ spiel@@ ch@@ ef@@ in Katharina Wagner is likely to have rejo@@ iced .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one notices that the audience with the &quot; ring &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has grown together in a certain way , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said shortly before the performance of the d@@ pa . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the audience has not only made a form of peace with Cast@@ orf , but it also has grown an understanding of its view .
I draw a positive ré@@ sum@@ é .
Max amount works as a volunteer
they work in several places in their volunteer year .
where everywhere ?
crowd : usually in stone in the furniture market , once a week I am working here in Gre@@ ven in the furniture bridge .
and I worked at school already in the open day .
what are your experiences with it ?
quantity : it &apos;s a nice , wide spectrum I see here .
I have to do with different people , with young people , with refugees , with young adults .
they are 26 years old , so a late @-@ time volunteer .
how does that come about ?
amount : I did a high @-@ school diploma .
and then a civil engineer , let &apos;s say , successfully broken off .
I know for myself that it is a wrong thing for me and I want to do something else , work with people .
and then I asked myself what do you do .
do a social year , there is an insight , there you can see how it is on the spot , at the focal point perhaps , really .
and was it so ?
quantity : I collected great impressions .
I will start my studies in social services during the winter semester .
I will study dual , probably doing a social worker education in Ju@@ gen@@ dam@@ t Her@@ ne and studying in Ham@@ m at the University of Applied Sciences .
is it not unusual to have several different places of use during the volunte@@ ering service ?
amount : yes , it is very variable .
it always depends where you are going to be FS@@ J .
you can do it from Alter@@ sheim to youth work - in all possible facets of social work .
with me it was very varied .
I was partly in the O@@ GS , so in the afternoon care .
for me it was just the right thing that irrit@@ ated me .
I could see my own strengths and see how it really works .
different than in civil engineering studies ?
a lot : well , it &apos;s not about calculating stagn@@ ation .
one always has other people in front of the head , each having a completely different story behind them .
whether a refugee , whether a young person from the family has been brought out of the family - you always have to deal with it individually .
very interesting .
and you didn &apos;t have any reservations ?
amount : I &apos;m not the guy for that .
it is an area that gives a lot .
lots of love , lots of kindness .
there are also negative moments , but life is just that way .
Pear@@ son reduces further 3,000 jobs and cuts dividend to revi@@ ve business
British education group Pear@@ son said on Friday , it will cut more 3,000 jobs and cut its interim divi@@ den@@ ds by 72 percent , as another restructuring programme will be launched to overcome the pressure that the company faces .
the job cuts , which Chief Executive Director John Fall@@ on predominantly announced at the end of 2018 and early in 2019 , comes in addition to his previous restructuring in which 4000 jobs were already lost .
in May , Pear@@ son announced a third cost cutting program to cut costs by another 300 million pounds ( 3@@ 94 million US dollars ) to revi@@ ve a business that was hit by the fast pace of digital learning .
the company , which last month sold its stake in Pen@@ guin Rand@@ om House to Ber@@ tel@@ smann , said that the outlook for the financial year remained unchanged , after having achieved an increase of 1 percent to 2.@@ 05 billion pounds in the first half of the year .
Kab@@ ul con@@ vo@@ y attack : NATO soldier killed in suicide bom@@ bing
a suicide bom@@ ber attacked a military con@@ vo@@ y in the Afgh@@ an capital Kab@@ ul , killed a NATO soldier and injured several others , say officials .
five soldiers and an interpreter were injured , shared an explanation of NATO .
according to un@@ confirmed local reports , three civilians died during the incident in Q@@ arab@@ ag@@ h district .
the bom@@ bing is the last act of violence that Afghanistan met this month - more than 30 people were killed in a mos@@ que in Her@@ at on Tuesday .
on Monday , a suicide bom@@ ber killed two people near the Iraqi embassy in Kab@@ ul .
in an opinion of NATO it is said that the explosion on Thursday evening has happened when a common pat@@ rol with the Afgh@@ an army was attacked by a man of impro@@ vised bla@@ sting . &quot;
the statement states that all injured are in a stable state and are treated in the US military hospital at the airport B@@ agra@@ m .
correspon@@ dents say that the growing strength of the Tali@@ ban and the group known as the so @-@ called Islamic State ( IS ) in Q@@ arab@@ ag@@ h is a great concern for NATO troops in the nearby district of B@@ agra@@ m .
according to the United Nations , there were at least 1,@@ 6@@ 62 civilian fat@@ alities in Afghanistan in the first half of 2017 , of which about 20 % in the capital .
at the end of July , a suicide bomb was killed at least 30 people in a mainly Shi@@ ite district of Kab@@ ul .
the Tali@@ ban said they had done this attack .
on May 31 , a massive bom@@ bing in the centre of the city killed more than 150 people with the dead@@ liest milit@@ ant attack of the country since the US @-@ led troops pushed the Tali@@ ban out of power in 2001 .
violence under@@ lines the prec@@ arious security situation in Afghanistan , as US President Donald Tr@@ ump is considering increasing the number of U.S. forces supporting military and police in the country .
correspon@@ dents say that the suicide bom@@ b@@ ings in Kab@@ ul in recent weeks have caused a crisis of public trust in the government , their policies and , in particular , the reputation of President Ash@@ ra@@ f G@@ hani .
EPA Ret@@ ur@@ ns Decision to Del@@ ay the Smo@@ g Rule by C@@ lay
the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has decided to delay a regulation of the Obama administration , repe@@ ating that the States are obliged to reduce the smo@@ g @-@ causing emissions . this was done a day after 15 states compl@@ ained the agency because of the step .
the EPA announced late on Wednesday the decision to advance the so @-@ called &quot; o@@ zone provisions 2015 , &quot; and said that it shows the agency &apos;s commitment to cooperate with states .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we believe in dialogue with and by responding to our state partners , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said EPA CEO Scott P@@ ru@@ itt in an explanation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in June P@@ ru@@ itt had announced the intention of the EPA to determine the o@@ zone regulations - in which pollut@@ ant emissions should be measured in a part of the country in order to comply with stric@@ ter air quality standards - in order to delay a year by October 2018 .
a group of 15 mostly democratic states , along with the district of Colombia , filed a complaint on Tuesday and said that the effort was illegal .
the government of President Donald Tr@@ ump has tried to return a broad range of environmental regulations imposed by former President Barack Obama as part of a broader agenda that will stimulate economic growth , according to Tr@@ ump .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , efforts have triggered the democr@@ ats &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; feedback &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and conservation groups &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; concerns about the impact of greater emissions on public health . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the EP@@ O website says that inhal@@ ation of air , which contains o@@ zone , can reduce lung function and increase respiratory symptoms , such as asthma .
municipal council wants common space
at the end , the decision was clear : in two counter@@ parts , the Municipal Council of Flu@@ orn @-@ Win@@ ery decides to establish a common space in the future retirement home .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before the discussion there is an important information : the purchase contract for the still missing part of the property was signed , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reported mayor Bernhard T@@ j@@ ades . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it will still take some time for the area belonging to the church community to date , but there is no planning obstacle for the project to be st@@ em@@ ming from a private investor .
there is a discussion on a common room for this .
one of the two investors who are still in the boat has offered to meet the community .
on the ground floor , it would provide a living space - approximately 55 square meters - and an adjacent terrace with a space of 70 square meters for a special price .
the Administration and the majority of the Municipal Council are floating in such a common area not as a meeting point for the residents of the sen@@ i@@ ority of living , but openly entering the community .
as an example , the word of &quot; kn@@ itting café &quot; made the rounds .
the decision to be made by means of the provision of funds for the ongoing budget has already been decided last autumn by means of funding opportunities .
the building is located in the renovation area .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the establishment of a common room would be , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says T@@ j@@ aden , with 60 percent of 30 percent eligible . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the proposal fores@@ ees to signal the investor that in this respect they do not want to throw a bil@@ let between the legs , the finding that both saddle - which is le@@ aning against the surrounding structure - as well as the pent roof - which reduce the height of the trumpet and make the construction more economical - would be possible .
need@@ less , not only Wil@@ fried Soh@@ mer means this addition .
if it helps : it happens unanim@@ ously , it happens to the body .
it is not as easy as the common room .
Daniela &apos;s call points to the many of her own buildings , with whom you don &apos;t get so much forward , but now you rest in the common room from the window , she says : &quot; I &apos;m very hard with it . &quot;
Y@@ von@@ ne Sta@@ iger is necessarily speaking for the community space - but absolutely against communal ownership .
it sees behind it a cover@@ t subsi@@ dy to existing or even foreign investors .
this is not the case , because with the acquisition of the surface there is no surplus , but I get a real , in doubt market@@ able counter @-@ value , is the counter @-@ speech .
Sta@@ al &apos;s request to lift the resolution accordingly , finds three pro@@ pon@@ ents .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so there are two counter@@ parts in the original program , which Stefan H@@ aller summari@@ zes : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if we sum up the decision , we make a huge step towards closing a huge gap in our infrastructure . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
collision with car : cycli@@ st is thrown down on street
when crossing the road , a 82 @-@ year @-@ old cycli@@ st was captured by a car in Gar@@ ath on Wednesday and seriously injured .
like the police , the 82 @-@ year @-@ old Lan@@ gen@@ felder was travelling around 12.@@ 20 with his bike on the bike path of the road Schwar@@ zer Weg , coming from Hil@@ den .
the senior wanted to cross the road at the top of the road Am Buch@@ hol@@ zer Busch .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a passenger car driver in the same direction gave him priority . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
when the lan@@ gen@@ felder drove on the road , he obviously did not consider the on@@ coming traffic .
he met with a car that ste@@ ered a 66 @-@ year @-@ old Hil@@ den@@ ess .
the man was thrown into the streets .
he suffered severe injuries and was brought to a hospital with a return carriage .

in front of the Super@@ cup on Saturday ( 20.@@ 30 / ZDF and Euro@@ sport ) the German football record champion Bavaria Munich gets bigger and bigger .
trainer Carlo An@@ cel@@ otti has to do without David Al@@ aba in du@@ el with the BV@@ B .
this was confirmed by the Italian on Friday .
in addition , Manuel Neu@@ er , James , Thi@@ ago , Jer@@ ome Bo@@ at@@ eng , Ar@@ j@@ en Rob@@ ben and Juan Bern@@ at are missing .
for the five defe@@ ats in the past six test games , An@@ cel@@ otti bl@@ amed the physical condition and the missing balance in the game of his team .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we know that we are not in the best physical condition , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said An@@ cel@@ otti and added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the most important point is the balance in the team . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
last but not least , that was not good . &quot;
but the 58 @-@ year @-@ old believes in an increase in performance in the first official mandatory game of the season .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; football is also tactics , strategy , personality and motivation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I have great confidence that my team shows these qualities .
the crew is ready .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to play intelligent , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said An@@ cel@@ otti , who is expecting a &quot; difficult , intense game &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the du@@ el of the two German football heav@@ y@@ weights captiv@@ ates the fans .
the game is sold out with 8@@ 1,@@ 360 spectators , divided the German Football League ( DF@@ L ) on Friday .
w@@ ander in the resin from star to star
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the Harz Germany the first &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Star@@ seed Path &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is to
this is the planning of the association Stern@@ warte Sankt Andre@@ as@@ berg .
there is a planet path in Göttingen , since 2003 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; star trail &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is coming to meet the need for information of many visitors . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it connects nature , science , movement and athle@@ tic performance .
the members want to set plates along the planned route and inform about stars and con@@ stell@@ ations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a first phase until 2018 , the association plans &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; well accessible installations on five to six locations &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Ober@@ har@@ z . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
question will come from St. Andre@@ as@@ berg , Braun@@ lage , Hoh@@ eg@@ ei@@ ß and Sie@@ ber .
the information on the panels should be supplemented by internet .
this is why a good mobile network reception plays a role in the selection of the location .
accessibility is also a criterion .
later , the Ticket to Ride will be extended by train .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the star@@ base the viewer experience much worth knowing , for example about the physics of the individual stars , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the association . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they also learned why stars would have different colors or why a star is more light than another , although it was much further away .
I will also learn in which con@@ stellation you find a selected star and when it is best to see .
the association runs since 2014 in the mountain town of St. Andre@@ as@@ berg the highest situated observ@@ atory in northern Germany .
according to the Federal Office for Nature Conservation , the location in the Harz National Park ranks among the six dark@@ est regions in Germany .
often from there the Mil@@ ky Way and even the Andro@@ med@@ a Galaxy with naked eye can be seen clearly .
in the university town there has been something similar to the Plan@@ etary Trail on the initiative of the Planet@@ arium University of Göttingen since 2003 .
starting from Geb@@ hard &apos;s Hotel at the Goe@@ the@@ alle@@ e , which forms the interior of our solar system , the planet@@ arium leads up to H@@ ain@@ berg and the observ@@ atory - as well as an &quot; ex@@ tr@@ ater@@ restrial &quot; location in Di@@ em@@ arden ( commun@@ e of Glei@@ chen ) with the planet Sed@@ na .
the plan@@ ks with the individual planets - including the Plu@@ to degra@@ ded to the d@@ warf planet at the end point - are positioned exactly at the distance and measurement of one to two billion .
the earth shr@@ inks to a sphere of 6.5 millimeters in diameter , while the sun that is exactly 75 meters away measures 70 centimet@@ res .
the total distance of the planet is four kilometres .
while the light from sun to Plu@@ to takes about eight hours , pedestri@@ ans need a good hour to reach the st@@ ele with Plu@@ to .
thus , pedestri@@ ans are faster than the light in the cosmos .
the march to the next fixed star would last for half a year .
Mi@@ key Gar@@ cia and Vas@@ yl Lom@@ ach@@ enko meet for the first time discussing a possible show@@ down
Vas@@ yl Lom@@ ach@@ enko and Mi@@ key Gar@@ cia , who were to stand in a collision course in order to stage the most exciting boxing match in the near future under 147 pounds , met for the first time on Thursday .
they were in separate rooms at ES@@ PN offices in Los Angeles , until Gar@@ cia , the un@@ defeated World Bo@@ xing Council lightweight champion , went down the hall to greet Lom@@ ach@@ enko , the World Bo@@ xing Organization Super Spring Weight Champion .
following Gar@@ ci@@ as &apos;s victory through unanim@@ ous decision on the former four @-@ di@@ visi@@ oning world champion Adri@@ en Bron@@ er on Saturday at Show@@ time , both milit@@ ants are members of the Top Five Po@@ und @-@ for Po@@ und @-@ List .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gar@@ cia stretched out his right hand and said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; How are you , champion ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I wish you good luck . &quot;
Lom@@ ach@@ enko is defending his belt against Miguel Mar@@ ri@@ aga on Saturday evening at 7 pm on ES@@ PN .
when the couple posed for photos , Lom@@ ach@@ enko @-@ manager Eg@@ is Kli@@ mas@@ h noted that a possible show@@ down between the fighters would be the &quot; perfect order of magnitude . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m a former spring weight , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gar@@ cia rec@@ alled . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I grew up for Bron@@ der &#91; to 140 pounds &#93; , but I &apos;m not that big .
I am small for 140 .
I would like to come down on lightweight .
and he has to move to light weight &#91; 135 pounds &#93; and then we fight .
that is what the fans demand .
let us give them this . &quot;
Lom@@ ach@@ enko thank@@ ed him .
&quot; boxes need this fight . &quot;
climate asked whether it should be on pay @-@ per @-@ view , part of a strategy that Lom@@ ach@@ enko must fight with a 135 @-@ pound debut this year , in order to arrange a date with Gar@@ cia in the next summer ( 37 @-@ 0 , 30 kno@@ ck@@ outs ) who also has interest in the fight against the winner of Jor@@ ge Lin@@ ares @-@ Luke Camp@@ bell , after whose Light@@ weight Tit@@ le in the Forum on September 23 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this fight could take place in pay @-@ per @-@ view mode because all the fans asked him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Gar@@ cia , and later openly expressed his willingness to fight with the network that offers the best financial package . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we are the best .
no other names can create this kind of attention .
whenever they are ready ... &quot;
Gar@@ cia said he appreci@@ ates Lom@@ ach@@ enko as &quot; an enormous fighter , &quot; and he will possibly participate in his Saturday battle .
but Lom@@ ach@@ enko was thank@@ ful for Gar@@ cia and said he thinks the three @-@ fight champion from Ri@@ ver@@ side looks &quot; very slow , &quot; sorry Mi@@ key ... you wanted the co @-@ off . &quot;
Gar@@ cia said the focus was to show stro@@ kes , then boxes .
both said they could feel the momentum created for their own struggle .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the struggle that must be carried out . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
no other struggle creates so much attention and enthusiasm .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m more than happy to work on it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gar@@ cia . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Lom@@ ach@@ enko said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have waited for the top fighters , and that is Mi@@ key . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it will be a great battle . &quot;
four injured after tire burst
in an accident on the A@@ 7 , four persons were seriously injured in the afternoon on Thursday afternoon .
after initial information , Opel Za@@ fir@@ a lost control of his vehicle shortly before the end of the market .
the passenger car drove to the right into the slope , where he over@@ came and then remained on the roof in the green stri@@ pe .
the four occup@@ ants - two adults and two children - were seriously injured in the accident .
during the first supply of the injured by the ambul@@ ance service , the A@@ 7 was locked in the direction of the North for about an hour , and then the traffic on the left lane could be passed by the accident site .
For@@ tun@@ as Hoffmann : &quot; three @-@ chain works better &quot;
Andr@@ e Hoffmann hopes for the 2 : 2 season op@@ ener to Braunschweig to point out the optimisation of the defence force in Au@@ e points .
with the first match of the season , Andr@@ e Hoffmann was satisfied , with the result that they wouldn &apos;t have been the two opponents at 2 : 2 against Braunschweig .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these were two opponents too much , and we have to look better in Au@@ e , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the def@@ enders of Fort@@ una Düsseldorf . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the Or@@ e Mountains , the Triple @-@ Chain is to be further optimised .
and a gate after a free fall , the For@@ tun@@ en don &apos;t want to catch up anymore .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the future , there will be no doubt that there will be no more &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Michael &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the line . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Hoffmann is convinced that his team will better cope with the experience in preparation with the Triple @-@ Chain , than with the four @-@ chain .
&quot; I don &apos;t know how to act in Au@@ e , &quot; says his coach Fried@@ helm Radi@@ el , but Hoffmann is sure of his cause , &quot; because we just have the half @-@ positions in Ka@@ an Ay@@ han and Ni@@ ko fo@@ undry players who can build up well , &quot; said Hoffmann .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the prerequisite is , however , that we harmon@@ ize even better and we cannot afford so many ab@@ err@@ ations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
of course Hoffmann also moves to Au@@ e to win the game .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but if you can talk about a mis@@ guided start , don &apos;t know . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the performance could be okay , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Hoffmann . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but if we can stand on Sunday with four points and concentrate on the cup , we will certainly be able to speak from a ti@@ dy season op@@ ener . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his coach didn &apos;t want to know anything about it .
&quot; I only judged the start in the season only after six to eight days , &quot; said Fried@@ helm Funk@@ el , who would not want to speak of an advantage over Au@@ e , just because the game of Sax@@ ons in Hei@@ den@@ heim had to be stopped pre@@ mat@@ urely due to a storm .
&quot; now they can start the season almost with a home game , &quot; said Funk@@ el and Hoffmann , that the players from Au@@ e might be even more fres@@ her , since they wouldn &apos;t have a heavy and complete game like Fort@@ una for a favorite promotion in the bones .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but they don &apos;t know as much as they are at the moment , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the Interior Minister of Fort@@ una . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
while the guests from the Rhin@@ eland become an easy favourite on Sunday in the meeting at last ( almost ) finished stadium of Au@@ e .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that we swe@@ ep it away , only because we are entitled to come below the first six is non@@ sense , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Funk@@ el , whose balance sheet is quite positive in just one defeat against Au@@ e out of nine games . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is no team in the 2 . Bundes@@ lig@@ a , which you have to beat in advance , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains For@@ tun@@ as chief coach . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; meeting such a statement would be arro@@ gant and arro@@ gant . &quot;
and so spark@@ le does not want to experience his players on Sunday .
new results of Swedish asylum application tests published
the latest results of tests for asylum seek@@ ers in Sweden , which have under@@ gone a new method for medical assessment of their age , show that more than 80 percent of the tested persons are older than 18 years . however , not everyone believes in the accuracy of these results .
the Swedish authorities for For@@ en@@ sic Medicine ( Rä@@ t@@ ts@@ medic@@ in@@ al@@ verk@@ et ) started the tests last year .
during the asylum procedure , they should take a closer look at the assessment of age after the Swedish Migration Department ( Migration Panel ) has been critic@@ ised for errors in ass@@ essing the correct age of some refugees who were minor .
up to now , migration sales have sent 6,@@ 8@@ 80 cases to test and the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency has now published the results of a total of 2,@@ 4@@ 81 tests from mid @-@ March to 31 July 2017 .
ei@@ ghty percent ( 2002 ) were assessed as 18 or older , while in further 25 cases the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency assessed that the person was &quot; possibly 18 years or older . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in 4@@ 32 cases , the conclusion was that the person &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; may be under 18 years old . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the tests are conducted only in cases where the age of the person is questioned .
according to Johan Gö@@ ran@@ sson from the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency , the results have been stable over the past few months .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we see no big difference in the statistics of the past months , the figures are fairly constant , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said the magazine &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Local . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the high proportion of cases in which the person has been judged for over 18 years does not necessarily mean that the asylum seek@@ er has lied about his age .
in May , the agency published the results of 5@@ 81 tests and said that there are 4@@ 42 cases that &quot; suggest that the person under investigation is 18 years or older . &quot;
when the paper Sv@@ ens@@ ka D@@ ag@@ bla@@ det investigated the 5@@ 81 results published she found out that in 24@@ 3 of these cases the person had openly said that she will be 18 years old this year .
the method of medical retirement assessment , in which X @-@ ray images of wisdom teeth and MRI images are made of knee joints , which are then analyzed by dentists and radi@@ ologists , has also been critic@@ ised in some areas .
a scep@@ tic is the en@@ doc@@ rin@@ ologist Claude Marcus des Kar@@ ol@@ in@@ ska @-@ Institut , whose work involves the assessment of the biological maturity of humans , to see if sooner or later they usually went through pu@@ ber@@ ty .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I had reason to think about it and I don &apos;t think that the type of measurement should be used . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
judging the biological age in this way is very un@@ safe .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if we cannot say it , we should not do as if we could , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said the newspaper Metro . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , Gö@@ ran@@ sson of the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency has defended the accuracy of the tests : &quot; in general , you can say that the risk of a child as an adult is low .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the greatest risk is when the person is under 18 , in this case , this is about 10 percent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
fully in the plan
the work on the three bridges of the highway 108 between Lau@@ ter@@ bach and Sch@@ ram@@ berg progres@@ ses well .
on Wednesday , a seven ton concrete part was installed at the bridge at the eastern entrance of Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are very good at the time , it &apos;s going to be great , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Rein@@ hold Lei@@ cht , Head of Civil Engineering and Transport at the governing pres@@ idency of Freiburg . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in April , the work began at the same time as the bridges between Sch@@ ram@@ berg and Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
the building end is scheduled for October and Light is sure that the schedule will be respected .
the first bridge , coming from Sch@@ ram@@ berg , leads across the Tro@@ mb@@ ach .
it is a concrete arch bridge made of concrete , which is cla@@ d with red Bun@@ ts@@ and@@ stein and has a total length of 4.@@ 80 metres .
it was built in 1900 .
like the two other bridges , it has now come into the years .
in order to ensure stability and road safety , the three buildings are now thoroughly rehabil@@ itated .
the two other bridges lead over the Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
they are made of red Bun@@ ts@@ and@@ stein .
both were built in 1939 and are twelve , respectively 10,@@ 60 metres long .
the bridge at the entrance to Lau@@ ter@@ bach has now received a 1.@@ 30 metre wide and seven tons of heavy so @-@ called bridge cap on Wednesday morning .
this is an edge fixing which is also used as an operating lane .
on Friday a 2.@@ 20 metre wide bridge cap is to be used on the southern part of the bridge .
then the pedestrian walk@@ way is to proceed .
the special thing about it is that it is finished parts , a patent of the Sch@@ ram@@ berger company Di@@ zw@@ o .
the other two bridges are already equipped with the patented bridge caps .
special finger@@ tip feeling has required the laying of lines through the building in Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
there is also a fibre @-@ optic cable to which many companies are connected .
the local residents were informed about the project in advance of the work .
fish and cra@@ y@@ fish first had to be f@@ ished .
for the bridges between the building yard and the collecting point towards Sch@@ ram@@ berg , traffic is regulated by a traffic light .
the road in the area of the bridge at the height of the Hotel &quot; Tann@@ en@@ hof &quot; and &quot; Si@@ eben Lin@@ den &quot; is completely closed for construction work on the bridge at the Lau@@ ter@@ bach entrance .
the costs for the three bridge claims amount to a total of 700@@ ,000 euros .
the whole thing is financed by the country .
Af@@ D in Ger@@ ol@@ stein : b@@ unter Protest with German potato salad
it is not so common that parties go on a strand , but when it comes to the alternative for Germany ( Af@@ D ) comes together , which is otherwise difficult to put under a hat .
the parties represented in the Krei@@ stag group of Vulkan@@ ei@@ fel ( CD@@ U , SPD , Green , F@@ DP , F@@ WG , Linke ) belong to a broad alliance that shows peac@@ efully this day , because the Af@@ D invites in the Ger@@ ol@@ st@@ einer Stad@@ thalle R@@ ond@@ ell to the &quot; big campaign launch &quot; according to the poster .
and well @-@ known names to start - like Alice Wei@@ del , who together with Alexander Gau@@ land forms the leading duo for the Bundestag election on September 24 , and vice @-@ president Beat@@ rix of Stor@@ ch .
but those who are on the spot for hours before the start of the event don &apos;t want to listen to the African eag@@ les but demonstrate .
the motto &quot; The Eifel remains colourful . &quot;
originally the city picnic under the motto &quot; All at one table &quot; is planned at the well site , but now takes place on the parking lot below the R@@ ond@@ ell - and thus directly in front of the eyes of those who come to the Af@@ D event in the Stad@@ thalle .
a colourful picture that offers itself .
and what Christ@@ a Kar@@ oli , chair of the Forums One World and one of the leading organis@@ ers , is delighted : &quot; great how many people have come together here . &quot;
there is music and plenty of food , including a &quot; ancient potato salad , &quot; which the Af@@ D could eat without any problems , &quot; said the woman who brought him along .
the police has ordered many civil servants to Ger@@ ol@@ stein , it shows presence especially at the railway station , which is only a few meters away from the venues .
how did the Af@@ D actually come to Ger@@ ol@@ stein ?
Mario Hom@@ pes from the Af@@ D vul@@ can@@ ic Eifel reports that he tried such an event and got the supplement .
the 45 @-@ year @-@ old from G@@ ön@@ ner@@ sdorf was first asked in Dau@@ n , but there was a cancellation because of the already built Lau@@ r@@ enti@@ us church there were not enough parking spaces available .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; well , therefore , the R@@ ond@@ ell , Hom@@ er is pleased that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we can have such a beautiful event here . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the good right of the people , the main thing , it remains peaceful . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is also a band for entertainment at about 20 o &apos;clock in front of the R@@ ond@@ ell@@ platz , in the Stad@@ thalle many speakers , among them the Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate Af@@ D president Uwe Boy .
around 200 listeners are waiting in the hall to wait for the nom@@ in@@ ee candidate for the Bundestag election , Alice Wei@@ del , and the deputy chairman of the Federal President , Beat@@ rix of Stor@@ ch .
the police presence remains unchanged , but until now the officials had a quiet evening .
a little more than an hour the Af@@ D event takes place , the guests on the forec@@ our@@ t have a longer breath , but also there is announced shortly after 21 o &apos;clock .
the police can come back - no special incidents .
tro@@ mb@@ one meets trumpet
a re@@ union with the Wolfgang Tr@@ ump@@ uni@@ sten Freder@@ ic B@@ elli is available in the series Has@@ lach &apos;s clo@@ ister concerts tomorrow , Sunday , at 8 pm in the monastery church .
together with the Bulgarian trump@@ eter Mi@@ ros@@ lav Pet@@ kov , he gives a concert under the motto &quot; Black Sea meets Black Forest , &quot; or even &quot; Balkan folklore &quot; meets a classical German education with roots in brass music .
both solo@@ ists are winners and winners of numerous international competitions and have held solo positions in European top orchest@@ ras .
thus Pet@@ kov Sol@@ ot@@ ro@@ mp@@ eter is the famous Concer@@ t@@ geb@@ ou@@ w Orchestra Amsterdam and Freder@@ ic B@@ elli is the solo player of the SW@@ R Symphony Orchestra .
both unite the desire not only to exceed the limits on their instruments , but also to merge the boundaries of the different genres .
Johann Sebastian Bach sounds like in a new gown , Daniel Schn@@ y@@ der &apos;s &quot; world music , &quot; together with Bulgarian folklore , and in the piece &quot; Exchange Suite &quot; of the jazz ech@@ op@@ er N@@ ils W@@ ogram , combine classical , jazz and free playing into a fascinating overall art work .
this key piece of the program was premi@@ ered this spring with great success in Freiburg .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some people love grilled cheese and will eat it until the end of their lives . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I want to try everything , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kri@@ sten Ste@@ wart has been quite open about their bis@@ exu@@ ality . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Oh that was cool , what &apos;s next ? &apos; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the most well @-@ known relationship of Hollywood stars was the &quot; Twi@@ light &quot; colleague Robert P@@ att@@ inson , who ended up bitter@@ ly .
despite all this , the brunette performer ass@@ ures the &quot; Har@@ per &apos;s B@@ az@@ aar &quot; magazine : &quot; I was in love with everyone I did .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or do you think I &apos;d have played it ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after their separation , Kri@@ sten admitted that they bis@@ exual : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have always lived and seriously believed du@@ alism . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
so it never confused me or hin@@ dered me .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I never liked to be taken seriously . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
she suffered especially among them , &quot; B@@ ang Show@@ bi@@ z , &quot; but in school time , when she preferred to dress like a boy : &quot; not all girls are typical girls .
that really hurt me .
when I was eleven I told me the children , I would look like a boy .
I really felt attacked , frigh@@ tened and ashamed .
now I look back and think : &apos; girl , be proud of you ! &apos; .
in particular , they don &apos;t like to explain their love life : &quot; people expect you to keep you in a certain way and that anno@@ ys me .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and perhaps some call me ung@@ rat@@ eful , but I don &apos;t like to justify myself in front of the general public . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
West Virginia Gover@@ nor announces that he changes the party
the Democratic governor of West Virginia , Jim Justice , announced Thursday evening in a manifestation with President Tr@@ ump that he will change the party .
whether you like it or not , the democr@@ ats have removed from me , &quot; said Gover@@ nor Justice .
&quot; today I will tell you with many prayers and a lot of reflection ... today I will tell you as a resident of West Virginia , I can no longer help you if I am a democratic governor . &quot;
the rally broke out in che@@ ering .
&quot; tomorrow I will change my registration to the Republi@@ cans , &quot; Justice added .
&quot; as a trainer , I would say it &apos;s time to play another game . &quot;
Mr. Tr@@ ump promised before a big announcement at the West Virginia R@@ ally .
Mr. Tr@@ ump won West Virginia with 42 points , and Justice did not endor@@ se the democratic candidate H@@ illary Clinton .
justice , according to For@@ bes , is the only billi@@ on@@ aire in the state , was elected in 2016 .
For@@ bes finds that he owns coal mines in five states and inherited a coal business from his father .
it is worth about $ 1.@@ 59 billion .
meanwhile , on Thursday evening , the Republi@@ can National Committee issued an explanation in which it said : &quot; the change of party from Gover@@ nor Justice is another blow to a Democratic Party which would rather prevent us from working to make our country great . &quot;
&quot; with only 15 provinces and the control of the least legislative bodies in history , the announcement of Gover@@ nor Justice is only the last rejection of a party which is without leadership from top to bottom and cannot find a positive , impressive message , &quot; said the R@@ NC chairman Ron@@ na Mc@@ Daniel in an explanation of the C@@ BS News .
Co@@ E pra@@ ises &quot; honest &quot; Russian ap@@ ology for dop@@ ing sc@@ andal
the global leader of athle@@ tics , Sebastian Co@@ e , commen@@ ded on Thursday what he described as a clear excuse from Russia for a dop@@ ing sc@@ andal , but he repeated that it is not the moment for the country to resume sports again .
Russia &apos;s athle@@ tics boss D@@ mit@@ ry S@@ hy@@ lac@@ h@@ tin said during the IA@@ AF convention on the eve of the Ath@@ le@@ tics World Championships that the exile of his country was correct and that he decided to fight the dop@@ ing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m sorry for &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all athletes , who were taken away in competitions gold and silver med@@ als . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
despite his comments , the IA@@ AF conference voted for the maintenance of the ban , which was imposed in November 2015 after a report by the World Anti @-@ Dop@@ ing Agency ( WA@@ DA ) had found evidence on state funded dop@@ ing in Russia .
&quot; I thought it was a very open answer today , a very honest presentation , &quot; said IA@@ AF President Co@@ e the repor@@ ter .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the entire Council and the entire Congress were pleased that the Russian Federation has recognized by itself that it has experienced some pretty hot times and will do everything possible to ensure that the Federation is re@@ designed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Co@@ E said he was also &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; delighted &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that Russia accepted the criteria for its re @-@ introduction . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think it was a very constructive day and I think that progress has been achieved but the Congress supports the recommendations of the Task Force that this is not the moment to use Russia again , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Co@@ e . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have to do everything in the coming months to norm@@ alize this situation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the guiding principle was always that we wanted to separate the clean athletes from the de@@ pra@@ ved system , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he added . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
ninet@@ een Russian athletes will compete in the athle@@ tics world champi@@ onships that begin on Friday in London following the strict IA@@ AF criteria as neutral players .
the leader of the IA@@ AF task force , R@@ une Ander@@ sen , said on Monday that Russia needs to meet some of the criteria for re @-@ setting .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; drug tests are still inadequate and forbidden trainers are still active , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said repor@@ ters in London after a talk at the IA@@ AF Council . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
funeral ceremony for soldiers cut off in Mali
during a funeral service in the north Hes@@ sian town of F@@ ritz@@ lar , around 1000 people of the two died in a helicopter crash in Mali .
the ceremony took place on Thursday in the cathedral city under high security precau@@ tions .
the defense minister Ursul@@ a von der Le@@ yen ( CD@@ U ) said nothing to the un@@ resolved crash .
she described the two opposite pilots as &quot; experts of their profession . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we bow down to this highest sacrifice which they have provided in the name of the Federal Republic of Germany , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she explained . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the 33 @-@ year @-@ old Major and the 47 @-@ year @-@ old Stab@@ sh@@ aup@@ t@@ mann from Nord@@ h@@ essen came to life in Mali on Wednesday a week ago .
her coff@@ ins were transferred to Germany and on Thursday accompanied by a guard of the Bundes@@ wehr into the F@@ ritz@@ lar@@ er Dom Sankt Peter .
at mid@@ day only the members of the church took leave .
afterwards the funeral service began in the circle of the family , closest friends , representatives of the Bundes@@ wehr and politics .
among them were H@@ ess@@ ens Prime Minister Volker Bou@@ ff@@ ier ( CD@@ U ) and the general inspec@@ tor of the Federal Ar@@ med Forces Volker Wi@@ ek@@ er .
ro@@ ses laid down ro@@ ses , the relatives stood by arm in arm at the coff@@ ins .
before the church , F@@ ritz@@ lar@@ er and numerous soldiers followed the ceremony on a screen .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; defense Minister of the Le@@ yen called the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; highly decorated &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; soldiers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Stab@@ sh@@ aup@@ t@@ mann had constructed the flying operation of the fighter pilot Tiger in F@@ ritz@@ lar and was one of the first six trained tig@@ ers of his regi@@ ment .
Volker Bau@@ ers@@ lau@@ de , commander of the regi@@ ment , to whom the soldiers belonged , declared : &quot; if this occupation could not turn off the crash , nobody would have liked it . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; doubts about the UN mission in Mali : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Le@@ yen said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The use is dangerous . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but it is also of great importance &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for a country from which we are separated only by two states , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the funeral ceremony , the coff@@ ins were brought out of the cathedral .
when and where they are buried , the Bundes@@ wehr did not provide any information .
Prince Hen@@ rik doesn &apos;t want a grave next to his wife
the man of the Danish Queen Mar@@ gre@@ the ( 77 ) , Prince Hen@@ rik ( 83 ) , does not want to be buried next to his wife after his death .
that shared the King &apos;s House on Thursday .
traditionally , the Danish royal couple is buried in Ros@@ kil@@ de &apos;s Cathedral .
the sculp@@ tor Bj@@ ør@@ n N@@ ør@@ ga@@ ard already made a sar@@ cop@@ h@@ agus for the two .
the Queen had agreed with her husband &apos;s decision , and he continued to give her a message .
where Prince Hen@@ rik is buried , be still unclear .
but he did not intend to be buried in his French homeland .
Prince Hen@@ rik had never made a secret that he was not happy with his title .
after the accession of his wife Mar@@ gre@@ the in 1972 he would have liked to become king .
in 2016 he retired to give the title &quot; Prince Su@@ pper . &quot;
as Hen@@ rik had not received the title and function he wanted , he did not see himself as equivalent to his wife - even after death , L@@ ene Bal@@ le@@ by , chief spokes@@ woman of the Danish Royal House .
where the last resting @-@ place of the 83 @-@ year @-@ old will eventually be , be still unclear .
but he did not intend to be buried in his French homeland , but in Denmark .
he likes the country for which he worked in the last 50 years .
the native Henri de Labor@@ de de Mon@@ pe@@ z@@ at , son of a French noble family , met Mar@@ gre@@ the 1965 in London .
at the Th@@ ames , he worked in the French Embassy .
during his later wife , the sympath@@ ies of the people always flo@@ ated , Prince Hen@@ rik had a heavy duty with the Dan@@ es during his 50 years of reign .
in an auto@@ biography , Hen@@ rik said about the first years in Denmark : &quot; a few months after my arrival , everything I did was critici@@ zed .
my Danish was fluctu@@ ating , I preferred wine instead of beer , silk stum@@ ps instead of kn@@ itted so@@ cks , Cit@@ ro@@ ë@@ n instead of Volvo , tennis instead of football .
even for the Gau@@ lo@@ ises that I smo@@ ked instead of Virginia tobacco and who had the reputation of being the brand of corporate critical intellec@@ tuals , I could not hope for indul@@ gence .
I was different .
I seemed to be happy with that position and not ashamed .
these were two mistakes ! &quot;
Prime Minister Wei@@ l wants quick re@@ election
CD@@ U and F@@ DP in front of a possible majority in Lower Saxony
Prime Minister Stephan Wei@@ l ( SPD ) is after the loss of the red @-@ green government majority for a quick re @-@ election of the parliament , but he does not want to step back .
that was the reason for the resolution of the parliament on Friday .
prior to that , the surprising withdrawal of a Green Party de@@ pu@@ ties from their Land@@ tag faction in Lower Saxony had over@@ thrown the government of Prime Minister Stephan Wei@@ l ( SPD ) into a serious crisis .
five months before the official date of the Parliament elections , the red @-@ green coalition in Hanover lost their scar@@ ce one @-@ votes majority in parliament to the opposition from CD@@ U and F@@ DP .
the former Green Party member El@@ ke T@@ life@@ jackets founded their step with non @-@ nom@@ ination for election 2018 in its constitu@@ ency in Rot@@ enburg ( W@@ ü@@ mme ) .
&quot; I see my political future in the CD@@ U , &quot; she explained on Friday in Hanover .
CD@@ U leader Bj@@ ör@@ n Th@@ ur@@ ler wants to recommend S &amp; D to his group to include them .
thus CD@@ U and F@@ DP had 69 seats in the Land@@ tag of Lower Saxony , SPD and Green 68 seats .
until now , the relationship was revers@@ ed .
the new Land@@ tag will be elected regular on January 14 next year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Red @-@ Green state government must now decide whether or not it can continue to go@@ vern in this situation without a majority . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , Stephan Wei@@ l thinks it is essential that the state day as quickly as possible decides its self @-@ dissolution .
the CD@@ U will probably decide on further action on Tuesday .
the state constitution also provides the possibility that the parliament &apos;s parliament el@@ ects the trust and sel@@ ects a successor .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our Constitution provides several options . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these possibilities must be thoroughly tested legally , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said th@@ ur@@ ler . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will discuss all questions in peace if they are legally tested . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what is called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; T@@ anner &apos;s step &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is something strange . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the politi@@ cian himself stressed : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am not a tra@@ it@@ or . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I feel very good . &quot;
she described herself as a follow@@ er of black @-@ green .
the Gre@@ ens called on the apost@@ ate de@@ pu@@ ties to return their country &apos;s mandate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course , we assume that , with immediate effect , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she will return her country convention with immediate effect , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the president Met@@ a Jan@@ ssen @-@ Ku@@ cz and Stefan Kör@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said S &amp; D Group president An@@ ja P@@ iel : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we deeply regret the decision of El@@ ke T@@ life@@ jackets extremely . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she deliberately decided not to lead a pron@@ unciation in the Group . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; even against the background that there were no substan@@ tive differences , we cannot comprehend this step . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
SPD Chancellor candidate Martin Schulz condem@@ ns the transition from Lower Saxony &apos;s Gre@@ ens El@@ ke T@@ life@@ jackets to CD@@ U as treas@@ on .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the behaviour of the former Green Party de@@ pu@@ ties in Lower Saxony is not only betra@@ yal of voters but also betra@@ yal of red @-@ green , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote the chief of the Social Democrats on Friday on Facebook . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he supports the decision of Prime Minister Stephan Wei@@ l ( SPD ) to quickly re @-@ elect the Parliament .
the withdrawal of T@@ anger@@ ens costs red @-@ green in Lower Saxony the majority .
the politi@@ cian imagine &quot; in her past vanity and in her fru@@ stration her personal interests before the good of the country , &quot; critic@@ ised SPD Secretary General Hu@@ ber@@ tus Heil .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a sc@@ andal that the CD@@ U in Lower Saxony gives this dirty intri@@ gue and attempts to make political capital out of it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Dutch CD@@ U group leader Bj@@ ör@@ n Th@@ ur@@ ler wants to recommend his de@@ pu@@ ties to include El@@ ke T@@ life@@ jackets in the CD@@ U .
the SPD leader of the SPD in the Bundestag , Thomas Op@@ per@@ mann , designed v@@ ests to for@@ ge ahead with personal career as a result of the 2013 Parliament election .
the CD@@ U was at that time before the SPD the strongest force , SPD and Gre@@ ens had a very thin majority of one vote in the parliament .
interview - How do we protect ourselves from po@@ isons , Mr. Schmidt ?
Germany disc@@ usses contaminated eggs .
how could the sc@@ andal erup@@ t ?
how can consumers protect themselves ?
Minister of Agriculture , Christian Schmidt ( CS@@ U ) speaks in an interview with the editorial network Germany ( R@@ ND ) .
Mr Schmidt , how can consumers protect themselves from toxic eggs ?
I can only encourage all consumers to view the eggs in your fridge and check the stamp on the stamp .
the federal states present the latest information about the affected eggs @-@ bat@@ ches on the consumer protection portal www.@@ food@@ servic@@ n@@ ung@@ .de .
affected eggs should be destroyed or returned .
even if after all that we know at this time , health haz@@ ards are practically excluded .
does Al@@ di now assume the best possible crisis response - all eggs out of the offer - because the central role of the enligh@@ ten@@ er is not really perceived by the Federal Minister of Agriculture ?
food monitoring is the task of the federal states .
nevertheless , my house has opened immediately and has been in close contact with the authorities of the countries since the announcement of the const@@ ern@@ ation of Germany .
all information and risk assessment are available to consumers .
just like the manufacturers , trade has to ensure that the products sold are market@@ able and harmless to health .
if the residual sugar level of 0.00@@ 5 mg / kg is exceeded with eggs , these are not accessible .
un@@ loaded eggs can , however , be sold and consumed .
this time , the factories are not to blame .
do Production Proc@@ esses and Consum@@ ers sit in the same boat ?
according to the present state of knowledge , the production facilities do not meet any immediate fault .
on the contrary , they have to expect economic damage due to the presum@@ ed illegal practices of service companies .
as always , there is too little control in the case of an emergency .
is there only a lack of personal or coherent responsibility ?
it was just the official controls that have revealed the process .
the truth is , however , that food fraud and criminal energy can never be ruled out by 100 percent .
it is precisely for this reason that a consistent enligh@@ tenment of such events and the transfer to the prosec@@ ut@@ ors in the cases in which criminal off@@ ences can be present are of decisive importance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have already made it clear that I expect a complete enligh@@ tenment from the responsible authorities . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
is regular al@@ er@@ mis@@ m really necessary for food sc@@ and@@ als ?
consumers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; consumers have the right to only get safe and market@@ able food . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if an un@@ authorised insec@@ ti@@ cide is used in the food industry , consumers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; are rightly indign@@ ant . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the pan@@ ed means manufacturers , retailers and consumers get into a situation which is absolutely not necessary .
in principle , it must be clear that the un@@ lawful use of the insec@@ ti@@ cide Fi@@ pron@@ il in the attitude of food @-@ delivering animals is unacceptable and must be terminated immediately .
this must be done consistently and with high pressure on all levels .
I expect from all the competent authorities that the facts are quickly and completely enligh@@ tened .
how to impact football on N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s move to Paris
the rules that aim to prevent un@@ imped@@ ed expendi@@ tures of European football clubs will not distur@@ b N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s world record transfer from Spain to French Paris @-@ Saint Ger@@ main .
any consequences will come for Paris Saint @-@ Ger@@ main of UEF@@ A , as the leading organization that over@@ sees the European game has the power to prohi@@ bit teams from entering the prestigious champi@@ ons league tournament .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; financial Fair Play rules launched in 2011 by UEF@@ A means that PS@@ G will eventually prove that the transfer of N@@ ey@@ mar was financed without major losses . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Barcelona has paid 2@@ 22 million euros ( 26@@ 2 million dollars ) to purchase the Brazilian from its contract , and N@@ ey@@ mar receives a salary that will amount to tens of millions of dollars a year .
here are some of the financial aspects of N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s move to France .
PS@@ G can certainly make money loose in order to sign N@@ ey@@ mar and bring him to a gal@@ axy of other stars , in view of the financing of the team by the generous ruling family of Qatar .
clubs are allowed to spend a lot of money for the purchase of players , but must counter with legitimate income sources enabling them to break the break even point in their activities related to football .
FF@@ P was designed by Michel Plat@@ ini after his election to the UEF@@ A President in 2007 .
the former French player believed that associations who had taken enormous debt in their quest for success effectively dec@@ eive and ris@@ ked to ruin themselves when banks or owners with@@ drew their support .
in 2011 , FF@@ P shifted from concentration to the debt of clubs on the monitoring of their losses .
the change meant that the business model that Roman Abra@@ movi@@ ch originally used in Chelsea in 2003 - bought a club with potential and then invested strongly to improve the team and build a global brand - becoming a harder matter .
during the current three @-@ year period of FF@@ P , which runs until 2018 , clubs can accept losses of EUR 30 million .
and even though Plat@@ ini has fallen from the pres@@ idency in 2015 , his successor , A@@ lek@@ s@@ ander C@@ efer@@ in , will continue to sc@@ are away from excessive spending .
&quot; surely FF@@ P is not dead and we will certainly reinforce the rules for the future , &quot; said Andrea Tra@@ ver@@ so , who is responsible for FF@@ P for the UEF@@ A , compared to The Associated Press last week .
although the PS@@ G has paid the buy @-@ out clause of N@@ ey@@ mar in a flat rate , it can distribute the amount for the billing over the duration of its contract .
N@@ ey@@ mar has signed a five @-@ year contract so that the redemption rate for the next five years can be exp@@ elled in the amount of 4@@ 4.4 million euros in the annual financial statements .
the first wave of FF@@ P sanctions in 2014 brought the PS@@ G together with Abu Dhabi , which is owned by Manchester City , with the tough@@ est sanctions .
the PS@@ G received a fine of € 60 million ( at that time 82 million dollars ) , which later reduced to 20 million euros - and it was ordered that the team members for the Champions League of the 2014 / 15 season will be limited to 21 players instead of the usual 25 players .
the UEF@@ A is looking for clubs that could try to out@@ wi@@ t their financial supervision by infl@@ ating their revenues by companies associated with the owners of a club .
while a Catal@@ onian company could sponsor the PS@@ G if the value of sponsor@@ ship should exceed the standard market rates , the UEF@@ A would not be regarded as legitimate income .
this was exactly what happened in 2014 when the UEF@@ A decided that the sponsor@@ ship of the P@@ SA was infl@@ ated by the Qatar Tourism Authority .
it was reported that part of PS@@ G payments to N@@ ey@@ mar could come about payments from the Organ@@ izing Committee of the 2022 World Cup in Qatar .
but PS@@ G and Qatar 2022 have argued that N@@ ey@@ mar World Cup ambass@@ adors are going to be and such a manoeu@@ vre for the UEF@@ A regul@@ ators could be easy to find out .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the sanctions against PS@@ G mean that UEF@@ A will be even more attentive to ignore any attempt to circum@@ vent the rules . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the UEF@@ A had no prepar@@ atory talks with PS@@ G about N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s Transfer , said on Thursday the people who are familiar with the situation .
they spoke under the condition of anonym@@ ity with The Associated Press , because they were not authorised to discuss the PS@@ G situation .
the latest published reports show that PS@@ G 2015 / 16 with a turnover of 54@@ 2.4 million euros has achieved a profit of more than 10 million euros .
the accounts for the last financial year must still be published .
PS@@ G expects N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s arrive a blessing for sponsor@@ ing deals , merchan@@ dis@@ ing and trim sales .
the association assumes that sales will rise by at least 30 percent after signing the contract .
the Spanish League was clearly irrit@@ ated to see one of the best football players , and they tried to prevent N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s away by claiming that PS@@ G would viol@@ ate the FF@@ P .
&quot; it is a clear case of &quot; financial dop@@ ing &quot; with the club and the state , &quot; said the President of the La League , J@@ avier T@@ eb@@ as , the Spanish daily AS with regard to Qatar &apos;s final ownership of PS@@ G .
Ar@@ senal @-@ Manager Ar@@ sene Wen@@ ger , whose association is owned by an American sports ty@@ co@@ on , shares the reservations of La League against a state funded by an association .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is the consequence of the owner and that has completely changed the overall landscape of football in the last 15 years , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wen@@ ger said on Thursday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; once a country has an association , everything is possible . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it becomes very difficult to respect the financial fair play because you have different ways or have different interests if a country has such a big player to represent a country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Swiss is looking for a new chocolate supplier
Cho@@ col@@ ate Fre@@ y Board Cho@@ col@@ ate has produced chocolate for Swiss Life in recent years .
now the sweet co @-@ operation is in front of a possible end : the airline will re@@ write the order .
on request by the news agency S@@ DA , Swiss @-@ speaking spokesperson Mei@@ ke Fu@@ hl@@ rott confirmed a corresponding report from the newspaper &quot; Northern Switzerland &quot; on Friday .
according to current planning , the airline will conclude a new contract in the first half of 2018 .
the products were reviewed every two to three years and subjected to quality control .
&quot; we are very satisfied with the current supplier Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y , &quot; said the spokes@@ woman .
around 17 million small red @-@ white printed sho@@ cks are distributed to 14 grams per year before landing at the passengers .
Swiss does not want to provide information about the cost .
industry insi@@ ders estimate the order volume according to &quot; Nor@@ thwest Switzerland &quot; to 1.5 to 2 million Swiss francs - the Mig@@ ros subsidiary achieves an annual turnover of about 1 billion Swiss francs .
but what is more important is the advertising effect : it is a prestigious order for a chocolate manufacturer .
Swiss does not want to betra@@ y how many applicants there is a new tender .
but there are only Swiss manufacturers who come into question .
according to the newspaper report , Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y wants to seek a renewal of the Treaty on Spring 2018 .
for the S@@ DA , the largest Swiss chocolate manufacturer was not reachable for an opinion .
Swiss choc@@ ol@@ ates distribute the chocolate boards on board their flights since 2006 .
Barry Cal@@ le@@ baut has supplied chocolate tablets in collaboration with Hu@@ g before the Swiss contract with the Mig@@ ros subsidiary .
two and a half years ago Swiss Life made the possibility of placing the logo at the start of the cooperation with Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y .
the airline collabor@@ ates with various Swiss chocolate producers .
on long haul flights the customers of the First Class with treats from Con@@ fis@@ erie Spr@@ ün@@ gli are spoiled , in the Business Class passengers Scho@@ gg@@ i von Lin@@ dt and in Economy Class Scho@@ gg@@ i by Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y .
Swiss Scho@@ gg@@ i also distri@@ butes chocolate from Cho@@ col@@ ate Fre@@ y , both in Business and Economy Class .

nostal@@ gia goes into &quot; W@@ et Hot American Summer &quot; and &quot; Com@@ rade Det@@ ective &quot; into the niche
this repeti@@ tion of history is nostal@@ gic at the same time because of the glorious days of the characters of the 80 &quot; s , for the 90 @-@ year Gr@@ unge era ( as the thin@@ ker David W@@ ain and Michael Show@@ alter the Sk@@ etch com@@ edy &quot; The State &quot; for M@@ TV ) , and for themselves - that is , for 2001 , before their stars , such as Elizabeth B@@ anks , A@@ my Po@@ eh@@ ler and Paul Ru@@ dd went to bigger things .
as a cultural arti@@ fact , it is equally a par@@ o@@ dy and em@@ bodi@@ ment of our Facebook @-@ capable era of permanent memories .
but as fran@@ chise it feels like the time is scar@@ ce .
&quot; first Day of Camp &quot; worked surprisingly well , not only because of its absurd hum@@ our ( it contained an original story for a talking can of vegetables spoken by H. J@@ on Benjamin ) .
casting herself on the core of the g@@ ag - actors of middle ages play hor@@ ny children who are grown up - nevertheless they managed the im@@ possibility to regain the last part of the weather .
&quot; ten Years L@@ ater , &quot; with his adults , who now play adults , is less emotion@@ ally rooted and his par@@ o@@ dy goes more after the fo@@ undry principle , including a riff on the Stal@@ ker films of the 90 &quot; s like &quot; The Hand That Ro@@ cks the C@@ rad@@ le &quot; ( &quot; The hand that sh@@ akes the cra@@ dle &quot; ) .
at one point , a character sticks through an Apple @-@ Power@@ book , some inline sk@@ ates and &quot; a number of other things dating back to 1991 . &quot;
many of the central stories are the same .
the gra@@ cious C@@ oop ( Mr. Show alter ) , now Rom@@ aut@@ or , has still not forgotten K@@ atie ( Mar@@ guer@@ ite Mor@@ eau ) .
Victor ( K@@ en Marino ) has not lost its vir@@ g@@ inity .
and there is another mad @-@ evil plot , included in the Ron@@ ald Re@@ ag@@ an ( also Mr. Show@@ alter ) , who is now supported by George H. W. Bush ( a well @-@ successful impression of Michael Ian Black ) .
as always , the courses are the best part of fran@@ chise .
it is a lot of fun to see the etern@@ ally young Mr. Ru@@ dd , who shows Matt D@@ ill@@ ons Mu@@ sta@@ che of &quot; Sing@@ les , &quot; whose former Big @-@ Man @-@ on @-@ Camp Andy feels like an old cra@@ cker .
these are the moments of accidental ma@@ dness that could heat up this fran@@ chise as a kind of repeti@@ tive &quot; Seven Up ! &quot; series until he reaches that which I consider as his logical conclusion : &quot; W@@ et Hot American Summer : Tw@@ enty Years L@@ ater , &quot; whose final scene will show the band as they will visit the movie premiere of &quot; W@@ et Hot American Summer . &quot;
&quot; Com@@ rade Det@@ ective &quot; on Amazon now rec@@ alls some other kind of nostal@@ gia : the revival of the Cold War of &quot; The Americans , &quot; the film &quot; Atom@@ ic Bl@@ onde , &quot; and even &quot; G@@ LO@@ W &quot; with its east @-@ west @-@ west ring combat icon@@ ography .
the com@@ edy created by Brian Gat@@ ew@@ ood and Aless@@ andro Tan@@ aka is to be a found TV series : a Romanian drama of the eigh@@ ties with the two polic@@ emen as friends , two officers from Buchar@@ est who fight for truth , a@@ thei@@ sm and the way of Marxism @-@ Len@@ in@@ ism .
the main roles - a hard @-@ boiled Greg@@ or and an ide@@ alistic I@@ os@@ ef - are played by Flor@@ in Pier@@ sic J@@ r. and Corn@@ eli@@ u u@@ lic@@ i , whose di@@ alo@@ gues by Ch@@ anning Tat@@ um ( also an executive producer ) and Joseph Gordon @-@ Lev@@ itt be du@@ b@@ bed in English .
it is an ingeni@@ ous idea .
but it is not much more than an idea .
there are some nice flags to watch ( the police conf@@ ers the time to watch chess on television , as Americans might do with football ) .
and the list of famous speakers - including J@@ enny S@@ late , Nick Off@@ er@@ man , Mah@@ er@@ sh@@ ala Ali and Ch@@ lo@@ e Se@@ vi@@ gn@@ y - provides a decent play &apos; Make the voice out &apos; .
but &quot; Com@@ rade Det@@ ective &quot; is so involved in the tru@@ th@@ fulness of a desperate propaganda drama - a mur@@ derer wearing a Re@@ ag@@ an mask is involved - that it often plays like a single one .
with six long episodes , it &apos;s gone , and the com@@ edy is not fast or frequent enough .
&quot; Com@@ rade Det@@ ective , &quot; reduced to a smaller length , could better deliver its ag@@ it@@ pro@@ p sati@@ re , since Greg@@ or and I@@ os@@ ef constantly visit the American Embassy , whose lobby is always occupied by two thick men who dev@@ our a bunch of ham@@ bur@@ gers .
the message for the imag@@ inated commun@@ istic public is that Western culture can make everything for food for a ban@@ quet .
the fic@@ ti@@ tious Romanian cre@@ ators were not wrong : we even make it with our own younger history and thei@@ rs .
blow against drugs ma@@ fia in the country
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the police have managed to strike a blow against the Italian Ma@@ fia in Baden @-@ Württemberg . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on Wednesday morning several objects were searched in the Schwar@@ zwald @-@ Ba@@ ar @-@ Kreis , Rot@@ t@@ weil , Kon@@ stanz , Ess@@ lingen and Stuttgart , as the public prosec@@ utor &apos;s office appeared on Friday .
fifteen accused were arrested at the age of 25 and 77 years and had already issued arrest warran@@ ts against them .
in addition , the officials were safe in large quantities of marijuana and co@@ ca@@ ine , fire@@ arms , and several hundred thousand Euros .
two persons were arrested in the same ra@@ ids in Italy .
against the two susp@@ ects Itali@@ ans there were German arrest warran@@ ts .
the two are therefore probably shipped to Germany .
Italian and Bavarian investig@@ ators were involved in the action .
a total of more than 300 polic@@ emen were deployed .
the Ma@@ fia members are accused of organizing drug crimes , serious violence , attempted murder , rob@@ ber@@ y and black@@ mail .
the public prosec@@ utor &apos;s office in Kon@@ stanz has been investigating the organised drug trade in southern Germany since the summer of 2016 .
between the public prosec@@ ut@@ ors in Kon@@ stanz and Palermo , there was a lively exchange and the investig@@ ators of the Cri@@ po Rot@@ t@@ weil had almost daily contact with their colleagues in Sicily .
for this reason , the large @-@ scale operation was accompanied by four officials from Palermo on Wednesday morning .
the investigation focused mainly on Italian nationals with close relation to the Italian ma@@ fia .
a incident on May 27 in Hü@@ fingen , where several shots were fired up early in the morning , should go to the bank account .
manner acc@@ uses large gaps in the foreig@@ ner register
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; data from citizens who should not show up &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this leads to some serious mis@@ decisions in case of asylum procedures . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to a media report , the Commissioner for Refu@@ gee Management of the German Government , Frank @-@ Jürgen Weise , has drawn attention to a large gaps in the immigration centre register .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; defici@@ encies in the data recorded there may &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; lead to some serious mis@@ decisions in the case of asylum procedures and deport@@ ations , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; warned the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to the Register , ten million people are registered with foreign citizenship , including some 5.@@ 7 million from non @-@ EU countries .
the data are therefore managed by some 600 immigration authorities in Germany .
because the data had not been sufficiently maintained , the quality of the data had not been good in parts so far .
in individual cases , dates from 1921 have been found , &quot; by people who are no longer alive , or of citizens who have become German citizens and should no longer appear in the register . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; incorrect data entries can slow return processes considerably , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the report further . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in statistics on sufficient people , EU citizens are also registered , who would not have to travel . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; such false classi@@ fications , however , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; have led to a distorted debate on dealing with tax@@ pay@@ ers , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says it in the analysis . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
meanwhile , the German government has obviously begun sending refugee families back to Italy with children under 16 years old when they left there .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it emerges from an internal paper of the Federal Office of Migration and Refu@@ ge@@ es ( BA@@ MF ) , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Neue O@@ sn@@ ab@@ rück@@ er Zeitung . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the paper thus says that BA@@ MF is performing such procedures for families with children - with the exception of infants and infants - to Italy since 1 June 2017 . &quot;
since the end of 2014 it was practically no longer possible , so the newspaper under reference to the difficult situation on site .
after the Dublin Agreement it is responsible for refugees from the EU state that they first achieve .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when a migrant travels to another EU country , this state can send it back to the country of entry . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the office now writes : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the meantime , the recording capacity for families with minor children in Italy has increased significantly . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Italy gave guarantees for the reception and accommodation of families .
even the European Court of Human Rights ( ECH@@ R ) keeps these commitments sufficiently .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; other EU states would also send refugees back there within the framework of the Dublin Agreement . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the domestic political spokes@@ woman of the left @-@ wing group in the Bundestag , U@@ lla Jel@@ p@@ ke , critic@@ ised this decision : &quot; families with children thre@@ aten due to the short@@ com@@ ings in the Italian asylum system of un@@ lawful entrance conditions and a threat to child comfort . &quot;
second best result achieved
a total of 220 litres of blood from people living in Ober@@ rei@@ chen@@ bach already provided blood don@@ ors for other people .
at least of the twelve citizens that were awarded on Friday .
above all Jürgen Gre@@ ule , who in the meantime distributed 50 litres of blood with his 100 donations .
traditionally , in the meeting of the council , the community hon@@ ours the willingness to don@@ ate blood .
&quot; it is ingeni@@ ous how our body is designed for it and we pay respect for the don@@ ors who make their blood available to strangers , nor un@@ sel@@ fish , &quot; emphas@@ ised mayor Karl@@ h@@ ein@@ z K@@ ist@@ ner .
&quot; a single blood donation helps several people , &quot; explained the district manager of the German Red Cross ( DRC ) , Holger Ma@@ isen@@ bacher , because the cann@@ ed are broken down into their components .
three persons could benefit from a blood donation .
at the same time , Ma@@ isen@@ bacher reports about the actions carried out in the spring of Ober@@ rei@@ chen@@ bach .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this year we achieved the second best result with 114 don@@ ors , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the DR@@ K county leader . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the change to the theatre house obviously resulted in higher numbers of participants a few years ago .
previously , Thomas Bo@@ ck@@ stadt , Susanne Reich@@ le , Sandra Schö@@ ck , Thomas Reich@@ le and Met@@ a res@@ h@@ ape joined the multi @-@ don@@ ors and were awarded 50 blood donations .
half as many awards Herbert Ma@@ ir and Dor@@ oth@@ ee Ri@@ ex@@ inger , while Tam@@ ara Pf@@ rom@@ mer , Petra Schle@@ gel@@ ess , Stefanie St@@ oll and Uwe V@@ etter gave ten times each 500 milli@@ liter of their life juice .
Bank of England will hold interest rates at 0.@@ 25 %
the Bank of England is expected to announce later that interest rates will remain unchanged after the weak economic growth and the weak@@ ening of inflation have damp@@ ened spec@@ ulation over an increase .
the Bank of England warned that economic growth will remain &quot; slu@@ gg@@ ish &quot; when it retained the interest rates on family income in the middle of an intensified pressure .
the political decision makers of the Monetary Committee ( M@@ PC ) of the Bank agreed with 6 to 2 to hold interest rates to 0.@@ 25 % , with fewer members seeking an increase this month , as weak economic growth has weakened the support for an increase .
in its quar@@ terly inflation report , the Bank reduced its growth forecasts for 2017 to 1.7 % and in 2018 to 1.6 % , and warned that the pressure on household income would continue , with inflation expected to rise to just under 3 % in the fall .
but it sign@@ alled that interest rate would be necessary in the next few years to cur@@ b the inflation of Bre@@ x@@ it and it said that the cost of credit might have to rise more than expected in the financial markets .
the members also voted to withdraw a portion of the M@@ amm@@ ut business cycle , which was issued a year ago after the Bre@@ x@@ it .
it will require time for the financing plan to provide cheaper financial resources for banks as of the coming February , although it was said that it will now be expected to provide £ 15 billion more in the framework of this system - with 115 billion pounds sterling .
minutes after deciding on the interest rate , the bank said : &quot; in the central forecast of the M@@ PC the gross domestic product ( GDP ) remains weak in the short term , as pressure on the real income of households continues to burden consumption . &quot;
at the interest rates , it repeated that &quot; a certain tigh@@ tening of monetary policy &quot; would be necessary for the cooling down of inflation and a &quot; somewhat larger &quot; extent than the markets expect .
the markets are currently forec@@ asting the first increase in the third quarter of next year and another in 2020 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , the Bank pointed out that elev@@ ations would be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; incre@@ mental &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; limited &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the forec@@ asted growth forecasts of the Bank for this year and next year are forecast for 1.9 % and 1.7 % compared to the forecast in May .
it maintained its growth forecast to 1.8 % in 2018 .
the pound declined to this news vis @-@ à @-@ vis the dollar and the euro .
the pound fell by 0.5 % to 1.@@ 31 US dollars and fell by 0.4 % to 1.@@ 11 euros .
the decision to no change comes after recent dis@@ ap@@ pointing growth figures have damp@@ ened the rising expectations of an increase in interest and GDP in the second quarter rose from 0.2 % in the previous three months to 0.3 % .
growth is expected to be 0.3 % in the third quarter , although it will recover slightly after the Bank towards the end of the year .
the latest inflation report provided little enthusiasm for households affected by rising inflation and minor elev@@ ations , since the tigh@@ tening will be even worse before it becomes better .
she added that in the next few years , monetary policy can &apos;t &quot; prevent the coming of income , &quot; but she added that wages at the end of her three @-@ year forecast will be &quot; clearly &quot; rec@@ u@@ per@@ ated .
the economy is also boo@@ sted by the increasing demand for British goods , which is attributable to the weak Po@@ und , which will compensate for a proportion of lower consumption expenditure .
the decision comes a year after lowering interest rates to 0.@@ 25 % last August following the sho@@ cking EU vote that caused the fall of the ground .
the bank estimates that it will likely take four years to fully reach the prices and the economy .
before the Bank &apos;s final decision on interest rates , the call for an increase in interest rose , as inflation increased the pressure on hard @-@ pressed households , with three polic@@ y@@ makers in July asking for an increase to 0.5 % .
inflation decreased from 2.@@ 9 % in June to 2.6 % in June , although the Bank said that this was expected and will attract them again in the coming months .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Bank said the excess in relation to its target of 2 % was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; quite &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to write &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the weak Po@@ und . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Andrew Mont@@ br@@ ine , Director at Cor@@ eco Mor@@ t@@ gage Bro@@ kers , said : &quot; in view of the recent decline in swap rates , the mort@@ gage market is likely to become more competitive again , since the credi@@ tors are lou@@ dly looking for businesses and want to end the year in a positive way .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the market looks particularly good for those who run the existing deals and complete the new mort@@ g@@ ages , and many with toll @-@ free options and low rates are becoming increasingly popular . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
N@@ HS ( National Health Service ) should prescri@@ be controversial HIV drug for 10,000 people
patients will receive access to a &quot; transform@@ ative &quot; HIV prevention treatment after a fight in front of the High Court against the funding of the drug in N@@ HS .
N@@ HS England announced that pre @-@ intercourse pre@@ exposure pro@@ phyla@@ xis ( pre@@ p ) , which can reduce the risk of infection in high @-@ risk patients by around 86 percent , is now delivered by the Health Service through a first three @-@ year study for treas@@ ured 10,000 people .
he agreed to finance the trial after the Court of App@@ eal confirmed a ruling by the Supreme Court in the last year , according to which the N@@ HS had the authority to pay for the pre@@ p in spite of the asser@@ tion that the local authorities should finance it .
the move announced on Thursday was welcomed by N@@ HS England leader Simon St@@ ev@@ ens as an &quot; important new intervention , &quot; while the National A@@ ids Trust ( NA@@ T ) called it the &quot; crucial moment . &quot;
sexual health clinics in London , Bri@@ gh@@ ton , Manchester , Liverpool , and She@@ ff@@ iel@@ d will be among the first to allow people to sign up and further clinics will follow in October , before it will be launched in the whole of England in April 2018 .
pre@@ exposure pro@@ phyla@@ xis ( pre@@ p ) is a result of HIV preparations taken prior to sex in order to reduce the risk of HIV infection .
studies have shown that pre@@ p significantly reduces the HIV transmission in infection @-@ prone areas .
pre@@ p prior to sexual intercourse means that just enough drugs are present in the body of a person to prevent an HIV infection .
such medications can be taken every day or so already two hours prior to sexual intercourse .
among those who are eligible for treatment include gay or bis@@ exual men , trans@@ sexu@@ als and individuals with HIV positive partners who have not been successfully treated .
in clinics , suitable participants are identified which agree to the study , including men , women , trans@@ gen@@ ders and individuals who have a partner whose HIV status is not known to be controlled by anti@@ retro@@ viral treatment .
people living in England and registered with a family doctor can also register for possible participation in their local participating sex clinic .
the program is signed £ 10 million and N@@ HS England signed a contract to supply the drugs this week following an international competitive procurement .
the study aims to assess the full potential of pre@@ p by collecting clinical evidence as it is used and implemented on a large scale .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; St@@ ev@@ ens said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this great new intervention should complement and over@@ take the far @-@ reaching and increasingly successful efforts to prevent HIV . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is another milestone in the more than three decades lasting progress in addressing one of humanity &apos;s greatest health challenges . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Deb@@ or@@ ah Gold , Chief Executive at NA@@ T ( National A@@ ids Trust ) said : &quot; this is a crucial moment in the fight against HIV .
pre@@ p , when target@@ ing people in need and vulnerable people , provides the opportunity to change the English HIV epide@@ mic .
from September onwards , people with high HIV risk will have access to this N@@ HS @-@ funded study in England to develop a new instrument that is truly individually controlled and not subject to negotiation with a partner , leading to the improvement of many lives .
we warmly welcome this announcement . &quot;
Ian Green , Chairman of the Board of Terr@@ ence H@@ ig@@ gins Trust , said : &quot; the priority must now be that the study is carried out quickly across the country and that no one who has a risk for HIV will be left behind .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now that the pre@@ p test medicine has been procu@@ red , we are on the best way to protect more than 10,000 HIV @-@ infected people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Shar@@ on Ho@@ d@@ g@@ son , Minister of Health , said : &quot; the start of the pre@@ p process is welcomed and over@@ due after months of delays and hes@@ it@@ ant implementation .
the evidence shows how transform@@ ative this drug can be part of our approach to HIV prevention and can end the transmission of this life @-@ changing infection .
this attempt brings us a step closer to the understanding of the advantages of pre@@ p .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now it is important that this study will be carried out as soon as possible across the country to protect people who are HIV infected and contribute to the conclusion of the dis@@ semination of HIV in society . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
living a big life : mezzanine and clever designer tricks have transformed this small Ear@@ ls Court apartment into a spacious home
Jo@@ anne Lei@@ gh , a former ban@@ ker with a passion for real estate , res@@ ized in 2014 from a large house in Kni@@ gh@@ ts@@ bridge to Ear@@ ls Court Apartment .
it is on the first floor of an elegant Queen Anne terrace - and it is proof of the new design that Jo@@ anne has not packed and sold her bags .
&quot; before that I lived with my ex in Kni@@ gh@@ ts@@ bridge in a much larger space , &quot; Jo@@ anne said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I looked for something comparable to my price . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I was shown this apartment in Ear@@ ls Court , and she had the same high ceilings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I fell in love with her and made an offer on that day . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
since the first visit , the 1,000 square foot has been completely over@@ hau@@ led .
originally a one bedroom property with a ne@@ sted layout - you had to go through the kitchen to get to the bedroom - wanted to add Jo@@ anne storage space and an intermediate floor to make optimal use of the generous ceiling height .
&quot; I wanted high ceilings , large windows , lots of light .
that was my requirement , &quot; she says .
for this purpose , she commissioned the architecture and design studio Du@@ ck &amp; Sh@@ ed by Er@@ fan Az@@ adi from Not@@ ting Hill to use 12.@@ 5 feet high ceilings and create a home that was not just a development , but also a place to live for Jo@@ anne .
the ceiling was not large enough to place two rooms on top of each other so that the architectural challenge was to create an intermediate floor in which one could stand .
Er@@ fan had to think cre@@ atively to solve the task .
&quot; the steel work is quite complicated , &quot; he explains .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we had to arrange the rooms so that they were stack@@ ed on top of each other without having to bend . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was not just about building a simple platform , but to put the steel in such a way that it had the right height for the function at the top or bottom . &quot;
this arrangement enabled Er@@ fan to place two rooms at full height - with a lot of additional drama .
for the mezzanine a classic copper light window of Ret@@ rou@@ vi@@ us over@@ looks the gl@@ amor@@ ous living area .
mirr@@ ored gold furniture , silver accents and vintage Ser@@ ge Mou@@ ille lighting set the style for the program .
the use of mirrors plays a role in adding theatre , space and light .
at both ends , a short corridor is mirr@@ ored to allow it to work longer .
in the kitchen , the mirr@@ oring feels like a window in another room .
at the entrance , mirr@@ ored units offer space for all the cutlery and glasses of Jo@@ anne .
by perc@@ ei@@ ving a gl@@ amor@@ ous space , the beauty of the living room can close the kitchen if it is not used .
folding kitchens are nothing new .
the special thing about this is that it is a garage door .
&quot; a bit of engineering art went inside , &quot; explains Er@@ fan from the steel reinforced , vene@@ ered MDF door .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is important so that when you push the door very easily slides . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
thanks to the clever use of space and storage , Jo@@ anne was able to gain an additional 16 m ² , an additional bedroom and an improved layout .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the end of the day you will sell the land - or how your property is valued , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Er@@ fan . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a ru@@ di@@ mentary form , a real estate agent will enter and conduct a calculation based on the soil size . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
here they have managed to enlarge the floor area while using high @-@ quality materials that give the room its luxurious advantage .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the materials are the things that you touch and therefore help create an emotional bond in a home , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Er@@ fan . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you don &apos;t love electrical outlets in the walls . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
these are important , but they don &apos;t play with your heart . &quot;
it shows that a flat can transform itself into something quite amazing by a good design and hei@@ gh@@ tened square footage of something standard .
in fact , like Jo@@ anne , you could decide not to leave them .
brothers fight for a 500 million US dollar real estate empire
two brothers are four decades after their Italian family founded the dy@@ nasty , in a dispute due to one of the largest real estate imperial Victori@@ as worth over $ 500 million .
the former director of the &apos; Carl@@ ton Football Club &apos; and developer Col@@ in De Lu@@ tis lives in a villa in To@@ or@@ ak , only three doors from his younger brother Paul . he has brought him to the Supreme Court to clarify how their property and assets should be divided .
Paul wanted to withdraw from family business since 2014 , but a sharp conflict of separation takes place in the Supreme Court .
together with her mother Anna , the brothers have accumulated 38 properties worth over half a billion dollars , since the family purchased a business in Smith Street , Coll@@ ing@@ wood in 1973 .
there , the family founded West@@ co Jeans and grew up to a chain of 160 retail stores .
it was sold for 85 million US dollars in 1999 .
this money has been invested in real estate and the portfolio of De Lu@@ tis now comprises offices in the city center , the development areas of Brun@@ swi@@ ck and Sor@@ ren@@ to , the apartments in Gold Coast and Mt Bul@@ ler as well as shopping centers in the suburbs .
following an agreement with her dec@@ eased father , Col@@ in was described as &quot; principal operator and the dominant personality &quot; in the De Lu@@ tis family - about two thirds of the company &apos;s assets and Paul about one third .
a court file states that this means that it has ownership in the value of $ 316 million and Paul worth 176 million dollars .
the distribution of real estate and cash has proved to be a problem for Paul .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the departments proposed by Col@@ in have left him with what I held for the best objects , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he wrote in an aff@@ i@@ da@@ v@@ it in 2015 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
last Friday , after several failed negotiations , the first hearing of the Supreme Court took place .
the brothers are now fighting for control of the existing business - including Col@@ in , as Paul claims to have excluded him .
Col@@ in ar@@ gues that this is not true , but repro@@ aches Paul to manage some possessions in@@ compet@@ ently .
in an early aff@@ i@@ da@@ v@@ it submitted by Col@@ in , he says he hopes to settle the dispute .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my Italian heritage stipul@@ ates that the family is the most important priority , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the cost increases in the case of hundreds of pages with aff@@ i@@ da@@ v@@ its , emails and reports from companies , including Del@@ o@@ itte , Pit@@ cher Partners and Charter K@@ eck Cra@@ mer , and with leading lawyers , including Allan M@@ yers , Q@@ C , and both sides held law firms .
Mrs. De Lu@@ tis and her dec@@ eased husband Luigi were Italian immigrants who operated milk and delic@@ at@@ essen from the late 1950s and bought a business in Brun@@ swi@@ ck in the early se@@ ven@@ ties .
they used the security to buy the Coll@@ ing@@ wood property , in which Col@@ in opened the first je@@ ans shop of the family .
Col@@ in says he started West@@ co when he was the High School in my last years when Paul was still a small child ( about 10 years old ) . &quot;
Anna De Lu@@ tis says she and Luigi , who died in 2012 , hoped to pass on her property to her sons .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Luigi often said to me that he never wanted the brothers to land before the court , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
two other brothers , Mark and Luke , are no longer part of the De Lu@@ tis Group , with Col@@ in claiming that when leaving the company , Mark paid $ 10 million and Luke 26 million dollars .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; both Luke and Mark are , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Paul says , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has become bitter about the conditions of their financial separation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Col@@ in has with@@ held very much , although he was a former AF@@ L member and after a biography of 2015 Ed@@ die Mc@@ Gu@@ ire was the best friend of the television star .
Fair@@ fax Media contacted Col@@ in and Paul De Lu@@ tis and their lawyers .
only Col@@ in answered via SMS to say &quot; I can really not say a lot &quot; because the case is in front of the courts .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is very sad that my brother Paul decided to su@@ e me and to pull our family name through the courts , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in mid @-@ 2016 Col@@ in wrote in a letter to the court that he tried to fulfill his brother &apos;s demands .
&quot; our father would not have wanted Paul and I to end in our current fight , &quot; he said and added that he &quot; still hope for a solution . &quot;
this hope seemed to pass by Friday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our affair will be solved in the near future by the courts , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Col@@ in wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Tr@@ um@@ ps &apos;s new Chief of Staff plans to limit the president &apos;s media abst@@ in@@ ence .
others have tried and failed .
perhaps John F. Kel@@ ly can actually do it .
if so , he will be the first .
Poli@@ tico reports that the new Chief of Staff of the White House plans to limit the flow of information to President Tr@@ ump - including the news media reports - hoping to hold the boss on a more uniform course .
here is a piece by Repor@@ ter Jos@@ h D@@ aw@@ sey :
&quot; when John F. Kel@@ ly , the new Chief of Staff of the White House , met on his first working day with executive employees , he represented a major problem in President Donald Tr@@ um@@ ps White House , which he wanted to repair : poor information that comes into the hands of the president .
Kel@@ ly told the staff that information about him should flow - whether on paper or in brief@@ ings - because the president would make better decisions if he would receive good information . &quot;
Kell@@ ys diagnosis makes sense , but others have tried to t@@ ame tr@@ ump by monitoring their media diet .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; President Tr@@ um@@ ps &apos;s relationship to television extends decades - and now where he is in the White House , his TV advertising is still strong . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; when candidate Tr@@ ump was upset because of unfair coverage , it was productive to show him that he received fair coverage of places that were to convince , &quot; said former presidential advisor Sam N@@ un@@ berg in February in front of Poli@@ tico .
Poli@@ ti@@ cos Tara Pal@@ mer@@ i wrote at the time that &quot; the key to keep Tr@@ um@@ ps &apos;s Twitter habit under control , according to six former campaign officials , is to ensure that his personal media consumption includes a steady praise . &quot;
okay .
but the idea that Tr@@ um@@ ps &apos;s Twitter habit was ever &quot; under control &quot; is ridi@@ culous .
perhaps these campaign officials are aware of what we do not know others - that Tr@@ um@@ ps T@@ we@@ ets would have included even more fuel without their interventions .
we will probably never know anything about the twe@@ ets that Tr@@ ump has not sent .
if his co @-@ workers managed to keep him away from him a few times , their efforts paid off .
but no one has consistently prevented Tr@@ ump controversi@@ es .
a part of the problem is that people in a White House composed of competing parties always try to advance their own agenda by presenting Tr@@ ump material that may promote their views from the world .
Poli@@ tico - busy with this story - reported in May about the preference of the advis@@ ers to bring suspi@@ cious information to the President for strategic reasons .
this was an example described by Repor@@ ter Sh@@ ane Gold@@ smith :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; current and former tr@@ ump @-@ officials say that Tr@@ ump like a volcano can react to negative press cuts , especially those with sham@@ eful le@@ aks , and that they are trying to find out where they come from . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this was exactly what happened at the end of February when someone was reluc@@ tant to publish a printed copy of an article by Got@@ tsch@@ inas , the website of the Internet pro@@ voc@@ ateur , Charles C. Johnson , who accused the deputy chief secretary K@@ atie Wal@@ sh &quot; to be the source behind a pile of le@@ aks in the White House .
although Johnson was permanently banned from Twitter because of har@@ ass@@ ment or that he has offered no concrete evidence or that he has expressed false accus@@ ations in the past and has rev@@ oked them .
Tr@@ ump read the article and started asking people about Wal@@ sh . &quot;
Gold@@ smith added that the then Chief of Staff Rein@@ ce Pri@@ eb@@ us and the General Secretary of the White House , Ro@@ b Por@@ ter , &quot; tried to implement a system to manage and document the tr@@ ump ram . &quot;
how did it work ?
Kel@@ ly tries three months later to do the same .
perhaps he will prove himself as a more effective manager than pri@@ eb@@ us , but Tr@@ ump is still his im@@ pul@@ sive self , and his consultants still strive for influence .
these imm@@ utable factors make Kell@@ ys &apos;s mission very difficult .
most sought @-@ after criminals get mail from Euro@@ pol
since the address is unknown , the help of the population is requested and hoped .
in this summer , the police all over Europe will send ( virtual ) post@@ cards to dangerous criminals on the run .
as the addresses of the sought @-@ after heavy @-@ break@@ ers are naturally not known , references from the population are hoped and requested .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Euro@@ pol has reported on Friday the action that follows the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; EU Most Wan@@ ted &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; calendar of winter . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the experience had shown that many fle@@ ets were hiding at holiday destinations , it was called Euro@@ pol .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have put together 21 post@@ cards for sought criminals from 21 EU countries . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
since 2016 , the website www.@@ e@@ um@@ ost@@ .exe has been viewed more than 2.5 million times .
36 of the online requests could be arrested so far , at least eleven of them based on the publication on the website .
travelers negotiate a dit@@ ch and return to the &apos; million@@ aire range &apos;
some of the weal@@ thi@@ est land@@ owners of West Mid@@ lands are back with some determined travellers on the way of war , who have tra@@ ded a tren@@ ch removed from the municipality to rec@@ la@@ im a field in front of their man@@ sions .
travelers have par@@ ked their 20 car@@ avans on a field outside of a wealthy street called Soli@@ hull , called the &quot; Million@@ aire &apos;s Series . &quot;
they brought horses , babies and an army of transpor@@ ters after they were thrown out in May without being deter@@ red by a tren@@ ch excav@@ ated by the Council to prevent their attacks .
the tac@@ t@@ ful group found a gap in defense posts and expressed their vehicles by a section that remained un@@ hin@@ dered to find a way .
angry residents forced the Council of Soli@@ hull , who said it was &quot; useless to deal with the problem . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; an anonymous inhabit@@ ant said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they moved there on Monday evening after they were sent to Bentley He@@ ath , where they threw stones on the p@@ asser@@ s @-@ by . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Council must indeed be forced by shame to implement , as it was useless when dealing with the problem . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the travelers were there in May , were moved on and are now back .
more came last night , probably even more today . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Council of Birmingham knows how to deal with it by holding a long brief@@ ing to protect its parks . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I live on the Stre@@ ets@@ brook Road and I am not happy to continue to pay my common charge if the Council cannot stop it . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; an inhabit@@ ant , who didn &apos;t want to be called , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is ridi@@ culous , we have just seen the last lap of these travellers just to be lo@@ oted from another round . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the numbers have increased this time and they even saw a horse in the parking area . &quot;
a spokesperson for the Council of Soli@@ hull said : &quot; we are aware of an un@@ authorised camp on the country beyond the Stre@@ ets@@ brook Road and cooperate with the police of Soli@@ h@@ ul@@ ls . we take the necessary legal steps so that they can move on as quickly as possible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in order to support our evidence , it is very important that as many residents as possible report anti @-@ social or criminal behavior in the police by invo@@ king 101 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this helps to create a picture of the situation in which the court must examine when we present our case . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise is made of Birken@@ hof
the Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise is from the former Hotel Birken@@ hof .
the house in front of the gates of Freu@@ den@@ stadt is being renovated and is scheduled to be opened on 1 March next year .
these are good news for the city .
because with the closure of the Birken@@ hof through the former Ambi@@ ence operating company Ges@@ mbH on the 13th of April 2014 , around 30,000 overnight stays were lost per year and also revenue from the tourist tax .
in the fall of 2014 , in view of the dramatic increase in numbers of refugees arriving in the district , the hotel building was offered to the district council as a collective shelter , which provided controversial discussions .
the city prevented the placing of asylum seek@@ ers by setting up a building plan to secure the area as a hotel location .
the decision was not un@@ disputed at that time in the Municipal Council .
but especially Freu@@ den@@ stadt &apos;s mayor Julian O@@ ss@@ wald defended the hotel location and already spoke about serious interested people at the house .
he should be right .
the group Lu@@ isen@@ hotels with managing director Bir@@ git Sch@@ erer with seat in Bad Berg@@ zab@@ ela acquired the former Hotel Birken@@ hof at a voluntary auction in Berlin and wants to make it back to a house of the three @-@ star Plus category under the name Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise .
the group has four houses with the Freu@@ den@@ stadt object .
two of them in Bad Berg@@ zab@@ era and one in Bad Herren@@ al@@ b .
you will find Hotel Lu@@ ise , Lu@@ isen@@ park , Park@@ hotel Lu@@ ise and now Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise .
at the former Hotel Birken@@ hof already for a longer time building sh@@ utt@@ les stand in front of the entrance , and when you enter the house , it becomes clear what extensive renov@@ ations are carried out .
the floors were pulled out , ceilings were demoli@@ shed , old bath@@ tu@@ bs removed from the rooms .
the entire hotel building is a single building site .
there is still much to do until March .
&quot; it is actually a beautiful hotel , &quot; says Thomas Sch@@ erer in conversation with our newspaper .
everything is to be renewed in the Black Forest style .
the rooms are equipped with large walk @-@ in showers , the entrance area is re@@ designed , new windows are installed .
everything was to be &quot; pretty bourgeois &quot; later , as Thomas Sch@@ erer expresses .
&quot; we want to make a piece of jewellery . &quot;
swimming pool , wellness area and a meeting room are part of the equipment .
you do not want to position yourself at the high level of the hotels in Lau@@ ter@@ bad , but already on an up@@ scale downtown level , Sch@@ erer emphasizes .
the Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise with its approximately 60 rooms wanted to set up , explains Sch@@ erer further .
both individual vac@@ ation@@ ers , groups or business@@ men should feel comfortable at the hotel .
he has already conducted talks with O@@ B Julian O@@ ss@@ wald and Tourism Director Michael Kr@@ ause , as Sch@@ erer .
the noti@@ ons of the city are identical with those of the hotel group .
&quot; we are on the same line . &quot;
according to the level of investment , Thomas Sch@@ erer does not want to determine exactly .
just under one million euros , he expects .
the external systems are also brought to the front , which is already clearly visible .
in a courtyard , a large terrace is created which will be accessible from the restaurant that is open to the public .
Thomas Sch@@ erer is optim@@ istic : &quot; Freu@@ den@@ stadt is a good market . &quot;
Russia Aff@@ air : us Special Inves@@ tig@@ ator sets up Grand Jury
in the Russia affair around US President Donald Tr@@ ump , special agent Robert Mu@@ eller is said to have used a so @-@ called Grand Jury after a report .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the committee recorded the work in recent weeks , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wall Street Journal &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; referring to the thing committed people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the newspaper ranked the step as a sign that Mu@@ eller had expanded and intensified his investigations .
the transmitter CN@@ N reported that there were already initial invitations to the committee in connection with a meeting between Tr@@ um@@ ps &apos;s oldest son and a Russian attorney .
U.S. intelligence agencies have been acc@@ using the Krem@@ lin since a long time being targeted in the 2016 presidential elections .
Mu@@ eller investigated whether there were agreements between Tr@@ um@@ ps election campaign team and Moscow .
the focus of the investigation should be several men who acted as advis@@ ors to the Republi@@ cans in the election campaign .
according to reports , Mu@@ eller also examined more and more dr@@ um@@ ps in a private and commercial environment .
a few weeks ago , the &quot; Washington Post &quot; wrote that the special agent Tr@@ ump personally moved into the centre and accused the accus@@ ation that the President may have disabled the judi@@ ci@@ ary in the course of the affair .
the main task of Grand Jury is to examine the evidence in possible crime cases and to decide whether it should be charged .
Grand Jury will therefore also be called anchor clips .
most of the time , they are turned on when dealing with larger and controversial cases .
the procedure is always carried out behind closed doors .
the Panel can also be turned on by the Public Prosecutor &apos;s Office in order to invite individuals to the company under oath .
according to CN@@ N , invitations have already been issued which revol@@ ve around the encounter between Donald Tr@@ ump J@@ r. and a Russian lawyer .
persons who were involved in the meeting were called upon to testify , was called in the report .
they should also provide documents .
in addition to Tr@@ ump J@@ r. there were also Tr@@ um@@ ps consultants and son @-@ in @-@ law J@@ ared K@@ us@@ h@@ ner as well as his so @-@ called election campaign manager Paul Man@@ a@@ fort .
legal experts said on Thursday evening in US television that the setting show that Mu@@ eller would not be in@@ timi@@ dated in his work and that if necessary , he wanted to act quickly .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , it does not necessarily mean that the Grand Jury will be turned on at the end to decide on the elevation of an indictment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nevertheless , the suspension of the committee is the beginning of a new phase in the investigations and a new cause for concern for president Tr@@ ump . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the midst of the new revelations , the President on Thursday evening used a speech in West Virginia to portra@@ y the Russia affair as a campaign of his political opponents .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Russia history is a total invention , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Tr@@ ump . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the subject gives the democr@@ ats an opportunity to &quot; feel good &quot; because they have nothing else to talk about . &quot;
his special consultant , T@@ y Cob@@ b , stated in a statement that he did not know anything about setting up a Grand Jury .
but he also usually works in secret , he stressed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the White House advoc@@ ates all measures that ex@@ pedi@@ te the work of the special agent &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fair &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the former FB@@ I chief James Com@@ ey said three times that he will not be determined against the president . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
one has no reason to assume that something has changed from it , it was stated in the declaration .
but Mu@@ eller was only used after Tr@@ ump Com@@ ey had fired .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because of this failure , alleg@@ ations against Tr@@ ump had become lou@@ der , he tried to h@@ amp@@ er the judi@@ ci@@ ary . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Com@@ ey said in June of a Senate Committee , Tr@@ ump asked him to set up investigations against the then National Security Ad@@ visor Michael Fl@@ yn@@ n .
the president is under great pressure because of the investigation .
according to US media , the White House collected material against the special agent and its employees .
this triggered spec@@ ulation about whether tr@@ ump Mu@@ eller would be released .
unlike an independent special agent of the Congress , as for example in the Wat@@ erg@@ ate Aff@@ air around the later retired president Richard Ni@@ xon , Mu@@ eller has a position in which he could theore@@ tically be fired at the request of the President of the Ministry of Justice .
several sen@@ ators of both parties want to prevent such a step .
two groups of Republi@@ can and Democratic Sen@@ ators presented draft laws on Thursday after which the negoti@@ ator could not be dismissed as easily as possible .
Antar@@ c@@ tica : giant ic@@ e@@ berg moves in Antar@@ c@@ tica
in the West@@ ant@@ ar@@ ctic a gigantic ic@@ e@@ berg was detached from the almost seven @-@ fold size of Berlin .
this shared the Bre@@ mer@@ ha@@ ven@@ er Alfred We@@ gener Institute for Polar and Marine Research on Wednesday .
the Kol@@ oss is now driving north and will probably need two or three years until it mel@@ ts .
with a length of 175 kilometres and a width of up to 50 kilometres , it is one of the largest ic@@ eber@@ gs that researchers have registered over the past three decades .
there is no danger for humans .
according to research data , the extent to which climate change has played a role in the demoli@@ tion of the ic@@ e@@ berg is unclear .
however , there have been a series of unusual frac@@ tures of ice sk@@ ul@@ ls in the region for about 30 years , writes the US research center for snow and ice ( N@@ SI@@ DC ) in a fact background .
according to many researchers , this could be related to global warming .
the now broken Kol@@ oss was a part of Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ ag .
Sch@@ el@@ fei@@ ra flo@@ ats on the sea and is fed by large glaci@@ ers .
it continues to grow into the sea and breaks down regularly .
the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ fei@@ ra lies south of South America almost at the top of the Antar@@ ctic Peninsula .
to the north of this hor@@ ses@@ ho@@ e , the balance of wa@@ xing and breaking was disturbed several years ago .
A@@ WI researcher Daniela Jan@@ sen writes a complete picture file there .
there is some evidence that the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ ag is in danger , as the front edge has never been as far back as at present .
in addition , the ice @-@ plate stands under tension and can crum@@ ble if at a key point breaks down a piece .
the melting of Sch@@ el@@ fei@@ ts and Eis@@ berg does not increase sea level as they float on the water and ice as much water as it results after the melting itself .
however , the loss of the ice shelf leads to the fact that the glaci@@ ers can flow directly into the sea and flow much faster than before .
this could possibly increase sea level , but only in a small degree , the British research project on the observation of Antar@@ c@@ tica ( Mi@@ das ) .
according to A@@ WI , Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ fei@@ ture is the fourth @-@ largest archipelago of Antar@@ c@@ tica with almost 50 000 square kilometres .
at the transition from the mainland it is up to 700 meters thick , at the front edge to the free ocean about 200 meters .
there it breaks down regularly .
&quot; although it is a natural phenomenon and we are aware of no direct connection to climate change , the ice sheet is now in a more dangerous position , &quot; said Martin O &apos;@@ L@@ ear@@ y from the British S@@ wan@@ sea University .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the longest retreat since the beginning of the records , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he also confirmed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
among scientists , it is disputed whether the Lar@@ sen @-@ C Sh@@ el@@ nail will grow back or fall back in the long term and possibly fall together , said his colleague Adrian Lu@@ ck@@ man and added : &quot; our models say that it will be less stable . &quot;
but this development will take decades .
even if these researchers do not bring back the demoli@@ tion of this gigantic ic@@ e@@ berg to climate change , many ice @-@ tu@@ fts of the Antar@@ ctic Peninsula have been dis@@ cer@@ ni@@ ble over the past decades .
this long skirt of the Antar@@ c@@ tica covers South America .
according to the British Antar@@ ctic Survey &apos;s research programme , the ice surface of the Antar@@ ctic Peninsula has decreased by 28@@ ,000 square kilometres since the 1950s .
the increase in temperature contributed to the decline .
over the past 50 years , the Antar@@ ctic Peninsula has war@@ med around three degrees and thus en@@ umer@@ ates the areas in which the temperature is the fastest .
CD@@ U wants to be a Hau@@ st@@ ari@@ f staff at the staff
because it is becoming increasingly difficult to occupy vac@@ ant positions , the CD@@ U demands to step out of the employers &apos; association in order to become more attractive .
just before the summer break , 41 new positions in administration were established .
more than 1,@@ 100 employees and civil servants work for the district administration in M@@ ett@@ mann .
now 17 apprenti@@ ces have their first working day behind them .
the apprentices@@ hips at the circle are apparently very sought after .
around 6@@ 20 applications were recorded for the places to be distributed this year .
however , there is still a lack of staff to cope with the increased demands and tasks .
currently there are still 50 vac@@ ant positions in the district of M@@ ett@@ mann .
among other things , we are looking for doctors and engineers , as well as forces of general administration .
in the Krei@@ stag , the CD@@ U wants to take the initiative together with the F@@ DP and U@@ WG and oppose the shortage of skilled workers in the administration .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the wish of the parties , the administration should develop a concept for personnel recruitment and personnel development . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the aim is to not only cover short @-@ term needs to specialists but to counter@@ act the future @-@ oriented assessment of the candidate .
the overall concept should ori@@ ent itself in@@ ward and out@@ ward , show concrete measures for newcom@@ ers and include a training offensive , call for CD@@ U , F@@ DP and U@@ WG .
that sounds like a good starting point .
because the circle has to do with personnel problems that you did not know earlier .
other cities attract good officials and employees and offer attractive conditions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the speech is from a real &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; competition of public employers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition , there is a high number of employees who leave the service due to illness or age reasons .
highest time for action so that not even more places remain un@@ occupied .
but Klaus @-@ Dieter Pe@@ op@@ les , Leader of the CD@@ U , goes beyond the common request with his party .
already in the chal@@ k day , he caused a big surprise when he publicly questioned the labour costs of the personnel and struck the other parties .
people want all the possibilities to be reviewed which enable a withdrawal from the municipal employers &apos; association .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if we do not come to a satisfactory solution at short notice , the county government should seek a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; house tari@@ ff , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in cooperation with the county @-@ affiliated towns . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the CD@@ U tries to better pay the employees and officials than the public service charges .
the sal@@ aries are exactly prescribed , hei@@ gh@@ tened or more money is only available if you switch to a higher level oriented towards professional years .
but the tasks of the circle have grown more and more in recent years .
only a few weeks ago , new premises had to be set up in which employees take care of the provisions of the new pro@@ stitution law .
not least because of the increasing number of asylum seek@@ ers , Land@@ rat Thomas Hend@@ ele and Kreis@@ direktor Martin Richter have a problem : they have too little staff .
Italy sharp@@ ens the tone for NGO Mig@@ rants Res@@ cue Bo@@ ats
Italy has warned the NGOs that use lif@@ ebo@@ ats for migrants in the Mediterranean warned that they will not be allowed to continue this unless they adhere to new rules for their operations .
&quot; if NGOs do not sign a new code of conduct , it is difficult to see how they can continue working , &quot; said interior minister Marco Minn@@ ith in an interview with the Turin daily La St@@ amp@@ a .
Min@@ ni@@ tis &apos;s warning came a day after the Italian authorities had conf@@ is@@ cated a boat from the German charity organization &apos; Youth Ret@@ ur@@ ers &apos; because their team worked effectively with human traffi@@ ckers in a way that facilit@@ ated illegal immigration .
the relief organisation , which has been in operation only for one year , refused to comment on detailed alleg@@ ations of the Italian prosec@@ utor Amb@@ ro@@ gio Car@@ to@@ sio .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are very sorry that we cannot operate in the search and rescue zone at the moment , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the organization in a statement on the social media . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we can only judge any accus@@ ations that are currently being raised after we have collected all information and can judge the situation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Italian authorities had supervised the boat of &apos; youth sa@@ ils &apos; , the I@@ u@@ v@@ enta since October .
it is thought that its crew is on board din@@ gh@@ y migrants who are directly supplied to them by human traffi@@ ckers , and that the s@@ mu@@ g@@ gl@@ ers can sail off so that ships can be used again .
at least one such meeting was claimed only 1.3 miles off the Libyan coast , according to the Prosecutor of the Prosecutor , whose content was published by Italian media .
the occupation is suspected of expos@@ ing itself to the authority of the Italian Coast Guard , the rescue operations in the zone for humanitarian reasons and not from any other motives .
under the code of conduct , boats such as the I@@ u@@ v@@ enta have to have an Italian police officer on board to monitor their activities .
only three of the nine NGOs involved in search and rescue operations have so far been willing to adhere to the code : save the Children , Mo@@ as from Malta and Pro @-@ Activ@@ a Open Ar@@ ms from Spain .
the latter said on Thursday that the new rules would be considered unnecessary but acceptable , as they would not bring any &quot; major changes or disabilities &quot; of their rescue operations .
among those who refuse to sign , the Nobel lau@@ re@@ ate organization is Doc@@ tors Without Bor@@ ders ( MS@@ F ) .
in the meantime , Minn@@ ith has said that the number of migrants who arrived in Italy after the emergency measures had declined sharply in recent weeks , suggest@@ ing that the efforts to strengthen the Libyan coast@@ guards and cooperation with local may@@ ors have borne fruit .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in recent days we have begun to see light at the end of the tunnel , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Minister . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he announced plans for further talks with Libyan citizens this month on economic development initiatives and with C@@ had , Niger and Mali on measures to reduce the number of migrants who leave these countries in hope to reach Europe .
asc@@ ents and tri@@ als
nine Wei@@ ler@@ ers Bi@@ ker , the &quot; Berlin Out@@ post &quot; and two guest drivers met at Wach@@ en@@ heim in the Nord@@ pf@@ alz region for four days to enjoy tri@@ als and si@@ ght@@ se@@ ein@@ gs .
three friendly guides were available for this purpose .
the accommodation in the Wach@@ en@@ heimer Tal proved to be a good starting point for the tours .
the castle and wine festival from Wach@@ en@@ heim was a welcome extra .
the first tour led to the Micha@@ el@@ skap@@ elle above Dei@@ des@@ heim during hot summer temperatures .
there were view@@ points , some on towers , from which one could look far above the Pal@@ at@@ inate Forest and the up@@ stream plains .
in between there were repeat@@ ed@@ ely longer asc@@ ents , rewar@@ ding for the long tri@@ als .
on the second day we went to Bad Dür@@ k@@ heim to the Sal@@ ine and the Volks@@ fest Wur@@ st@@ markt .
again , the look@@ out reached an observation point , connected by &quot; flew &quot; tri@@ als and moderate asc@@ ents .
on the last two days a lot of al@@ timet@@ ers were announced .
caves , rocks , towers , castles , ruins and h@@ uts brought welcome breaks .
in Bad Dür@@ k@@ heim the bi@@ kers inhal@@ ed cur@@ ative br@@ ine in the open @-@ air inhal@@ atorium .
Neu@@ stadt was also controlled .
after 17@@ 3 kilometres and almost 4@@ 500 metres altitude , the group had become acquainted with the Pf@@ äl@@ zer Wald from its best side - sporty and cul@@ turally .
console instead of lawn - Bundes@@ lig@@ a is equi@@ pping for e @-@ sports
are the sports stars sitting in front of computer consoles in the future , instead of fighting through the stadium races with wind and weather ?
fact is : e @-@ sport has long since become a serious business , becoming a lu@@ cr@@ ative business - big stars , millions of fans and huge tour@@ neys with high levels inclusive .
this also recognised the first federal Libyan people who are increasingly engaging in this area .
the beginning of 2015 was the V@@ f@@ L Wolfs@@ burg , later the FC Schal@@ ke 04 and last of the V@@ f@@ B Stuttgart , who founded an E @-@ sports division in mid @-@ July and signed two professionals for the computer game FIFA 17 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we hope to inspire new young target groups for the V@@ f@@ B , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says CEO Jochen R@@ ött@@ ger@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is sure , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that some clubs rise up on this train . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
next weekend , the FIFA World Cup in London organised the first &quot; Interactive Club World Cup , &quot; in which the gam@@ ers of different clubs compete against each other .
in addition to Schal@@ ke and Wolfs@@ burg , for example , Manchester City , Paris Saint @-@ Ger@@ main or PS@@ V Ein@@ d@@ hoven are qualified .
Robin D@@ utt also sees great potential in e @-@ sport .
the ex @-@ Trainer of Bayer Le@@ verk@@ usen and Wer@@ der Bremen now advises one agency for virtual football players .
&quot; real football has to deal with the 14 to 30 @-@ year @-@ olds in particular , that young people will continue to go to the stadium in the future , &quot; says the 52 @-@ year @-@ old .
and : the clubs tried to conquer all possible markets , especially the Asian ones .
with prominent e @-@ athletes under contract , one could be more often present on these markets more often than once a year to send the league to Asia .
what is it about ?
in E @-@ Sport , computer games such as &quot; League Of Legends , &quot; &quot; D@@ ota 2 , &quot; &quot; Co@@ unter@@ strike &quot; or the football simulation FIFA are being challenged at a competition level .
as in normal sports , le@@ agues have long established itself , in which the professionals compete against each other .
and E @-@ Sport is already part of the official programme for the 2022 World Cup .
but is it a proper sport at all ?
for many , the idea is certainly getting used to .
also In@@ go F@@ rob@@ bing has dealt with the question for a long time .
for the professor at the German Sport University in Cologne , E @-@ Sport is a sport because it is competitive and show many biological and physical reactions , which can also be found in classical sports - for example , increased heart rates , stress reactions , hormon@@ al changes .
furthermore , it requires cognitive abilities , a technical and tac@@ tical understanding and a fast reaction .
professional gam@@ ers should exercise not only on the console but also their body and look for nutrition .
&quot; the fit player is a good player . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but F@@ rob@@ bing also sees problems : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; dop@@ ing is becoming increasingly a topic . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
checks are difficult to perform in online games , and in the scene the structures of classical sports lack@@ ed .
the scientist emphas@@ ises the high integr@@ ative effect of E @-@ Sports .
players are on the move internationally , which is like a big global family , there are no cross @-@ cultural barriers .
a study conducted by Del@@ o@@ itte and the Federal Association of Interactive Entertainment Software ( BI@@ U ) predic@@ ts rapid growth in e @-@ sport .
in 2016 , 50 million euros have been implemented in Germany , mainly via advertising , sponsor@@ ing and big tournaments .
in three years , sales are expected to reach 130 million .
that is little against the barely 2.4 billion Euro of the Bundes@@ lig@@ a .
however , E @-@ Sport is no longer far from other established sports such as hand@@ ball , basketball or ice ho@@ ckey , &quot; the Del@@ o@@ itte consultants write .
many countries are already on the ver@@ ge of international growth .
big markets are Asia and the USA , where ex @-@ basketball players Sha@@ qu@@ ille O &apos;@@ Ne@@ al and Bas@@ eb@@ all@@ star Alex Rodri@@ gu@@ ez participate in the US team N@@ R@@ G e@@ Sports .
Hollywood actor Ash@@ ton Kut@@ cher inv@@ ests in the e@@ Sports Championships uni@@ kr@@ n .
there is a lot happening in Europe too .
in a Norwegian school , E @-@ Sport has been introduced as a lesson , says F@@ rob@@ bing .
in the Netherlands and France , D@@ utt &apos;s football club associations are now obliged to set up an E @-@ sport department .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the European comparison Germany lag@@ ged behind , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains V@@ f@@ B vice @-@ president R@@ ött@@ ger@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
to fall only in nostal@@ gia , and to clarify the old times , is no longer sufficient .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is about preserving the tradition of the association , but at the same time alig@@ ning the company to the modern market . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; we live in a digi@@ ti@@ sed world , &quot; D@@ utt also means .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can &apos;t keep in mind that only football remains as it was always . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

Mich@@ elle Car@@ ter sentenced for suicide by Con@@ rad Roy
a woman from Massachusetts was sentenced to two and a half years because she encouraged her friend through texts and calls for suicide .
Mich@@ elle Car@@ ter , now 20 , will spend 15 months of her conviction behind bars and five years were suspended on prob@@ ation .
Car@@ ter was sentenced in June due to negli@@ gent murder by Con@@ rad Roy who took his life on 13 July 2014 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the father of Roy said on Thursday at the hearing : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my family is un@@ comfor@@ ting . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
my son was my best friend . &quot;
Car@@ ter was allowed to stay free until his vocation .
she had been faced with a maximum penalty of 20 years , but her legal representatives argued that both she and Mr Roy had suffered from a mental illness .
dressed in red trousers and a cream @-@ colored bl@@ ouse , Car@@ ter stood with tears in his eyes , with folded hands and facing down eyes when she was convic@@ ted .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; their actions have killed Con@@ rad Roy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the prosec@@ utor to the court . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she finished his life to make her own better . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
she has no responsibility , &quot; she said .
&quot; she has not shown repentance . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but Car@@ ter &apos;s lawyer said it was a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; terrible circum@@ stance that they completely depl@@ ore . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
judge La@@ wr@@ ence Mon@@ iz said , however , he did not find that their &quot; age or maturity &quot; or even their mental illness have a significant influence on their actions . &quot;
a prosec@@ utor read a statement by Roy &apos;s mother Lyn@@ n Roy , who said that there is &quot; no day when I do not feel the loss of my beloved son .
I want him to be proud of me and how I deal with everything . I try to be there for eternity despite all my pain that we will carry for eternity . &quot;
Ro@@ ys &apos;s sister , Cam@@ dy@@ n Roy , testified that she would be &quot; persecuted by the knowledge &quot; that she would never attend the wedding of her brother or would be an a@@ unt for his children .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no longer the only person with whom I have been together since my birth is a pain I will always keep with me for the rest of my life . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the case seems to be a legal preced@@ ent , as there is no law in Massachusetts that makes it a crime to rec@@ la@@ im another , commit suicide .
Car@@ ter was 17 years old when Roy was found dead by a carbon mon@@ oxide pois@@ oning in a vehicle in 2014 .
the case attracted national attention after Car@@ ter &apos;s text messages revealed that she encouraged him to end his life .
&quot; hang on , spring from a building , catch yourself , I don &apos;t know there are many ways , &quot; she said in several news that she had sent in the two weeks before his death while he was on vacation with his family .
in the moments before his suicide she wrote : &quot; you must do it , Con@@ rad &quot; and &quot; Every@@ thing you have to do is turn on the generator and you will be free and happy . &quot;
judge Mon@@ iz said that Car@@ ter was looking for attention by the death of Roy and ordered that she should benefit from the case through some press .
the case has shared the legal opinion .
the few who defended Car@@ ter belonged to Am@@ anda Kno@@ x , who was sentenced in 2007 for murder of her British co @-@ resident in Italy before being acqu@@ itted two years ago .
Ms. Kno@@ x , 30 years old , published a comment in the Los Angeles Times : &quot; Mich@@ elle Car@@ ter deserves compassion and help , not prison . &quot;
Joshua Kim@@ ber@@ y : learning from the new FC Bayern
the fact that Joshua Kim@@ i was allowed to run as a captain in the Audi Cup is not a coinci@@ dence .
the FC Bayern won a big season with the Con@@ fed Cup winner - no extra motivation is possible there .
something was different in his place in the cabin , that looked Joshua Kim@@ ber@@ ley immediately , even though the additional piece of clothing was very , very small .
but as far and broad@@ ly on the second day of the Audi Cup no Philipp L@@ ah@@ m and no Manuel Neu@@ er were to be seen , he made a tie in his arm .
&quot; the trainer did not announce it , &quot; said the winner of the Con@@ fed @-@ Cup winner after his first deployment as a Bavarian @-@ captain .
well , the obj@@ ection could have run better than at 0 : 2 vs the SS@@ C Nap@@ les .
but the sign from the coach could also interpret Kim@@ i like this .
not the eight @-@ year old Ar@@ tur@@ o Vi@@ dal was chosen as a game leader in the C @-@ El@@ f from youth players , de@@ but@@ aries and just out of the holidays .
sugar is the best way to spread the sugar to those you want to keep in a good mood .
those who have been chosen to take the heritage of L@@ ah@@ m can only use a little extra motivation .
Kim@@ me confirmed : &quot; this is what you want as a player : take responsibility . &quot;
on Wednesday the 22 @-@ year @-@ old fl@@ atten@@ ed as a mini @-@ l@@ ame over the field .
to the right , that &apos;s his position , the white band@@ age on the arm did the rest .
and Kim@@ ber@@ ley worked at all in this run@@ way like the one who can take the ru@@ dder in his hand .
he gave instructions , tried to direct the un@@ played tro@@ upe .
he had the view to the whole , while many others were busy with themselves .
Vi@@ dal thus to re@@ play his missing fitness ( folded scar@@ c@@ ely ) ; Ren@@ ato San@@ ches with it , to tie the devil out to the achievements of the Asia journey ( also only condition@@ ally ) ; and Sebastian Ru@@ dy and Ni@@ kl@@ as Sü@@ le will not be negative in their first appearance in the Bayern @-@ Tri@@ k@@ ot .
this , after all , worked out quite well .
Sü@@ le ran beside Kim@@ me , Ru@@ dy in front of the def@@ ences , both acted confi@@ dently .
the well @-@ known Nap@@ oli storm was often difficult , and in addition , Sü@@ le tried a few times successfully in the construction of the game .
his colleague Ru@@ dy admitted that the result was &quot; not as we hoped for . &quot;
but he also showed a decent performance during his debut .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; game shift , tempo change : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for this style I was also picked up . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
as unusual this Bavaria @-@ world is still for the new entran@@ ces , one saw in the connection to the game .
for example , Ru@@ dy did not give one or two interviews in the cat@@ ac@@ om@@ bs , but for six or seven interviews .
Kim@@ i said good@@ bye after a few cris@@ p statements in the back of his new fellow players .
there he heard an interesting sentence from Sü@@ le : &quot; what is going on here , I have already noticed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Bavaria you just have to win any game . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after all , he doesn &apos;t have to teach the new .

company satisfied with Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate Minister : economics pra@@ ises Wis@@ sings Tempo
it was often irre@@ conc@@ il@@ able that the relationship between the country and the regional economy , when E@@ vel@@ ine Lem@@ ke ( Green ) was still Minister of Economics of Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate .
this shows itself after more than a year in which the new Minister of Economy , Volker Wis@@ sing ( F@@ DP ) is in office .
chambers and companies from the region speak on T V demand from a change in economic policy - and at the same time blame the old minist@@ erial .
Frank Nat@@ us , Chairman of the Association of Tri@@ erer Companies ( V@@ TU ) , says : &quot; Wis@@ sing attacks the wishes of the economy , which Lem@@ ke has all blocked . &quot;
the biggest turn@@ around sees Nat@@ us in infrastructure policy : the brid@@ ging of the motorway between Kel@@ berg and Aden@@ au is at the top of the country &apos;s priority list .
this year the Ministry is hoping for a planning process until 2021 .
a role in the plans of the country is also played by West@@ b@@ ypass Trier , which is in the urgent need of the Federal Rail@@ roads Plan .
the aim is to put the route into operation in December 2020 , says Ministry spokes@@ woman Corn@@ elia Hol@@ t@@ mann .
Nat@@ us sees this as a sign@@ post to support regional , but internationally competing companies .
the Chamber of Commerce and Industry ( Chamber of Commerce ) Trier is aiming for a Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate label to stimulate sales in supermarkets and to stop the trend of German exports falling apart for ten years .
in addition , Wis@@ sing has an open ear for people who want to set up a company , pra@@ ises the Chamber of Commerce .
the Chamber of Crafts Trier offers an additional incentive for young apprenti@@ ces in the new master bonus , says managing director Matthias Sch@@ wal@@ bach .
a premium of 1,000 euros is fores@@ een for the passing of the master exam and 2500 euros if graduates learn independently within ten years of master training .
but the home@@ work list for the country remains long .
at the planned road construction , facts are to be created quickly , at the same time the country lacks the necessary personnel , says Jan Glo@@ ck@@ auer , Managing Director of the Chamber of Commerce of Trier .
only 29 jobs have been occupied by 56 new engineers who wish to hire Wis@@ sing during state @-@ of @-@ the @-@ art mobility .
the I@@ HK has requested to award more contracts to external offices .
Christian Bal@@ d@@ auf &apos;s CD@@ U faction , Christian Bal@@ d@@ auf , refers to calculations of the Court of Audi@@ tors , the country has invested more than 20 million euros less in the receipt of country roads in 2017 and 2018 .
Frank Nat@@ us also expects a concept of the country to address the shortage of skilled workers in the region .
the former broad@@ band expansion in the country was also so@@ ber@@ ing .
in 2016 regional companies had rated the grid supply in an I@@ HK @-@ survey only with a score of 3,@@ 4 .
they compl@@ ained about stock@@ pil@@ ing internet connections and qu@@ arri@@ es .
ex @-@ economic minister E@@ vel@@ ine Lem@@ ke is currently out of politics and is still sitting in the Supervisory Board of the wind power company Pro Wind .
the Green faction moved from Lem@@ ke to April to become President of a private university in Karlsruhe , where after four months she had already cleaned up the field because of in@@ consist@@ encies .
Audi to change 85@@ 0,000 diesel vehicles - car manufacturers face a counter @-@ reaction
one day before the announcement of Audi , BMW said that it would offer to update the software in more than 35@@ 0,000 vehicles .
the BMW Group said the company believes that &quot; there are more intelligent options than driving restrictions , &quot; and thus focused on European cities - including Munich , where BMW is located - to ban or limit diesel vehicles .
Daimler announced on Tuesday that it will modify three million Mercedes vehicles in Europe to reduce its diesel emissions .
none of the companies described the enterprises as recall .
European automotive manufacturers have strongly encouraged the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States to support compliance with rules on carbon dioxide emissions .
but the nitrogen oxi@@ des that em@@ it diesel engines are considered carcin@@ o@@ gens and can cause asthma .
the costs for the automobile manufacturers to install equipment for neutr@@ al@@ ising the exhaust gases em@@ itted by diesel vehicles also increase what makes it difficult to keep the price of cars competitive .
German Chancellor Angela Merkel is also accused of h@@ acking the powerful car companies and ignor@@ ing the signs of the problem .
the companies try to avoid the mistakes of Volkswagen , which could regulate the use of so @-@ called shut@@ down equipment that could regulate emissions in order to comply with the regulations when a car was tested , but returned to normal driving conditions .
several Volkswagen employees were charged in the United States , while others were examined on both sides of the Atlantic .
last month , the former head of ther@@ mod@@ ynam@@ ics was arrested in Audi &apos;s engine development in Germany .
the former manager , Z@@ ac@@ ch@@ eo Giovanni P@@ am@@ io , is Italian and is therefore not protected from ex@@ tradition and could be tried in the United States .
at the beginning of this year , Audi was involved in German criminal investigations at Volkswagen after the authorities accused Audi to have installed a system to circum@@ vent emission regulations in Europe , and an inquiry focused on the United States has been expanded .
the inclusion of Audi into the study could seriously burden Volkswagen . the luxury car manufacturer contributes dispro@@ portion@@ ately to Volkswagen profits .
this message has the raft on Saturday at the Is@@ ar
the city wants to protect the Is@@ ar .
in order for the Is@@ ar visitors to participate , a raft passes through Munich on Saturday Saturday , which has a special message .
if you pass the Is@@ ar on Saturday , there will be a big raft between F@@ lau@@ cher and Rei@@ chen@@ bach@@ brücke .
and that &apos;s not a common raft , with Is@@ ar tourists .
but the building reference aims to elu@@ ci@@ date .
on the raft you can see a big information store .
it shows a garbage dump .
the pr@@ el@@ ude to a publicity campaign to appeal to the Is@@ ar visitors .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the motto &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; True Love is ... &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ... &quot; is to shar@@ pen the understanding of the Is@@ ar as a protective wild river . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
last summer , the raft sailed across the Is@@ ar and this year there are more actions and measures to achieve a consider@@ ate and environmentally conscious behaviour .
Mor@@ dil@@ los Kn@@ oll@@ enn@@ es and laugh@@ ing the suffering
Mor@@ di@@ llo was at times one of the most published carto@@ on@@ ists , the cle@@ av@@ age of his characters are his trademark .
also with 85 the Argent@@ ine@@ an is still drawing and working on a film .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; his message : laugh@@ ing , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for there is too much suffering in the world . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Guill@@ ermo Mor@@ di@@ llo was born on 4 August 1932 as a son of Spanish immig@@ rant in Buenos Aires .
in the first years as an artist , he suggested , among other things , as a drau@@ gh@@ ts@@ man for congrat@@ ul@@ atory cards - which frustr@@ ated him .
&quot; the happ@@ i@@ est day in my professional life was the day when I lost my job , &quot; he said once .
after stops in Lima , New York and Paris , he made a breakthrough at the end of the 1960s : with the publication of his carto@@ ons in &quot; Paris Match , &quot; and then also in the &quot; Stern &quot; and other leading magazines around the world .
even in China , Mor@@ di@@ llo found many fans .
again and again the artist was inspired by cities .
large , ro@@ un@@ dish Mor@@ di@@ llo figur@@ ines cav@@ ort in drawings with the Le@@ aning Tower of Pisa , Big Ben in London and the Red Square in Moscow .
in the early morning , according to his own data , he is still sitting at the drawing table , working almost ten hours a day .
about cal@@ endar@@ s , puzzles , books for young and old , t @-@ shirts , pl@@ ush animals and watches , his dro@@ ll figures continue to find much spread worldwide .
he has been working on a cartoon film and a TV series with his characters for six years .
the main character in the film &quot; Cra@@ zy Island &quot; is a gi@@ ra@@ ffe - Mor@@ dil@@ los most popular animal in his drawings - that has an exchange @-@ foot@@ er as an opponent .
for the first time , his figures speak in the 3D film , which should be projected onto the cinema screen in 2019 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know exactly what they will say , it &apos;s strange for me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Mor@@ di@@ llo . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the script is not written by him .
for this reason , he rather relies on the TV series which , as its original drawings , is produced wor@@ d@@ lessly .
la@@ ven@@ der from Provence is threatened by climate change
it has become a symbol of Provence in the South of France , but there is a warning that it is threatened by climate change .
la@@ ven@@ der is retro@@ grade because of the conditions reminiscent of d@@ rought conditions and insect @-@ borne insects , causing great head@@ aches to scientists and farmers who try to find solutions .
Eric Cha@@ isse , an expert in the agricultural research institute C@@ RI@@ EP@@ PA@@ M in Provence , said : &quot; la@@ ven@@ der in Provence is effectively je@@ op@@ ardis@@ ed because the plant has been exposed to the effects of climate change over the past years , which in the spring brought much less rain and in the autumn much more .
this has effects on the li@@ fes@@ pan of la@@ ven@@ der .
there is also a small ci@@ ch@@ ade , a micro @-@ bacter@@ ium that transm@@ its d@@ warf ci@@ ca@@ des , and in very dry weather there are many of them . &quot;
and there is a lot in the game .
la@@ ven@@ der oil attracts not only for vac@@ ation@@ ers , it is also very popular for perf@@ ume and cosmetics .
Eric Cha@@ isse said : &quot; instead of having very long plants with a large number of flowers , we have under@@ developed smaller , under@@ developed and either missing or weakened .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so we have fewer parts with essential oil . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the solutions considered include a better water distribution and slow@@ ing of evap@@ oration from the soil , but also spra@@ ying the plants with a protective mixture of clay and water and the development of varieties that are more resistant to d@@ rought .
the town of Gei@@ sa in the Thur@@ in@@ gian town of R@@ hö@@ n celebrates its 1200 year anniversary .
the festival highlight is this Saturday and Sunday with a medieval festival .
these days , Krä@@ mer , Zün@@ del , De@@ aler , Vag@@ ator , or a prisoner of war should be in the city centre on these days .
the assass@@ ination of a journalist under@@ lines the growing threat in Mexico
the staff of the weekly Ri@@ odo@@ ci@@ ce usually meet on Wedn@@ es@@ days to review their plans for reporting about the latest chaos in the state of Sin@@ alo@@ a by organised crime , corrupt officials and inc@@ ess@@ ant drug wars .
but on that day , in the shadow of their own tragedy , they came together to talk about security .
it was told them that it is important to change their routines .
two high @-@ level journalists discuss what feels safer : they are to take their children into the office , who were the target of an attack with gr@@ en@@ ades in 2009 , or leave them at home .
security experts have written three words on a panel on the front of the room : opponents , Neut@@ ral , Al@@ lies .
they ask the repor@@ ters to propose names for each column - no evidence is needed , percep@@ tions and stomach feelings .
there are drug s@@ mu@@ g@@ gl@@ ers , politicians , business@@ men , journalists who are suspected of standing on the government &apos;s pay@@ roll or cart@@ els , a catalogue of criminals who make the chaos of Mexico dangerous .
there is no rest from the violence , and as the bodies accum@@ ulate throughout the country , more and more journalists are there : at least 25 , since President En@@ rique Pen@@ a N@@ ie@@ to res@@ ig@@ ned in December 2012 . 5@@ 89 are under federal protection after attacks and threats , and so far there have been at least seven deaths in seven states this year .
among the latter are her publisher and her inspir@@ er of Ri@@ odo@@ ce , co @-@ founder J@@ avier Val@@ dez Car@@ den@@ as .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the greatest mistake is to live in Mexico and be a journalist , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote Val@@ dez in one of his numerous books on violence in connection with drugs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his absence is felt deeply , although his presence is everywhere - a big photo of Val@@ dez showing his middle finger with the word &quot; Justice , &quot; hangs on the facade of the Ri@@ odo@@ ce building . two repor@@ ters in the 1930 &apos;s , Aaron I@@ bar@@ ra and Mi@@ ri@@ am Ram@@ i@@ rez , wear t @-@ shirts , which show his smiling face with glasses or his typical pan@@ ama .
the workshop takes place less than two months after his death , and the repor@@ ters discuss their shared themes , trauma , night@@ mar@@ es , sle@@ e@@ pl@@ essness , par@@ ano@@ ia .
although a Special Federal At@@ tor@@ ney General was established in 2010 to process the cases of journalists , it has only initiated two criminal proceedings under the Committee for the Protection of Journ@@ alists .
as with most thousands of mur@@ ders , which are linked to drug traffi@@ cking and organised crime every year , the mur@@ der@@ ers of journalists are rarely put to trial .
at Ri@@ odo@@ ci@@ ce , they still ins@@ ist on treating the violence of Sin@@ alo@@ a , even though they are in@@ con@@ sol@@ able and although the terrain is now more tre@@ ach@@ er@@ ous .
without information about the mur@@ der@@ ers , without justice , the meeting for the discussion of security has little use , says I@@ bar@@ ra .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is very stupid to waste my time in this workshop , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; as long as we don &apos;t know why , we mi@@ str@@ ust everyone . &quot;
on the morning of May 15 , Val@@ dez left the office of the newspaper Ri@@ odo@@ ce in the provincial capital of C@@ uli@@ ac@@ an .
he only managed to drive a few blocks before his red Toyota Cor@@ oll@@ a was stopped by two men . he was forced out of his car and twelve times was shot on him , probably because of the name of the newspaper , which is translated with &quot; twelve river . &quot;
the sho@@ oter drove away in his car and damaged it nearby .
Val@@ dez was 50 years old .
he left a woman and two grown children .
rum@@ ors tend to fly freely in C@@ uli@@ ac@@ an .
but on the subject of Val@@ dez there is practically nothing but silence .
since Gu@@ z@@ man &apos;s arrest in the past year and the delivery to the United States in January , Sin@@ alo@@ a has become one of the bloo@@ dies@@ t batt@@ le@@ fields of the country since rival fac@@ tions are fighting to fill the vacuum .
it does not matter that in Sin@@ alo@@ a one or more people are shot on the street every day or that the cemetery is full of decorated two @-@ story mou@@ ths for drug kings that are larger than many homes for the living .
forget for a minute that there is a state of &quot; rest &quot; if only a cart@@ el has control over the coastal state with its valuable ports and drug trade routes in the United States .
nevertheless , despite the fact that Val@@ dez was aware of the dangers of his work , Is@@ mail Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez ( 60 ) , a co @-@ founder and director of Ri@@ odo@@ ce , was broken with the guilt that he could not protect his friend .
he believes that two mis@@ understand@@ ings have contributed to the murder .
first of all there was the publication of an interview with Damas@@ co Lop@@ ez , a leader of one of the ri@@ val@@ ising cart@@ el frac@@ tions in the war with Gu@@ z@@ mans sons .
this publication may have anno@@ yed the sons , presum@@ ed ga@@ it members bought each copy of the issue as soon as it was delivered to newspaper ki@@ os@@ ks .
the second mistake was not to force Val@@ dez to leave the country for his own security following the conf@@ is@@ cation of another newspaper that had published the same story .
Val@@ dez was a legend in Mexico and abroad , and his killing is considered a milestone in Mexican violence against journalists .
he had survived for so long that his friends and colleagues were accepting that he would always be there .
he worked as an experienced repor@@ ter for Nor@@ o@@ este in 2003 when he joined five colleagues to establish Ri@@ odo@@ ce and sold 50 US dollars hol@@ dings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Sin@@ alo@@ a , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was impossible to operate journ@@ alism without encounter@@ ing the drug ad@@ diction problem , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
with time , the newspaper earned a reputation for cour@@ a@@ geous and honest reporting , and sales and advertising increased .
repor@@ ters loved being able to publish hard @-@ fitting examinations without fear of cens@@ orship , and the readers were fascinated by a publication in which they could read stories that no one else dar@@ ed to treat .
eight years after the foundation of Ri@@ odo@@ ci@@ ce , she received the prestigious &quot; Maria Mo@@ ors Cab@@ ot Award &quot; for her coverage in Latin America .
in the same year Val@@ dez won the International Press Freedom Award of the Committee for the protection of journalists for his courage in pursuit of Mexican drug history , wherever she led .
he volunte@@ ered to be afraid .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I want to continue living , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said at the time of the CP@@ J award . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; drug trade in Sin@@ alo@@ a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is a way of life , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said last October in an interview with Rom@@ pe@@ vi@@ ento @-@ TV . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you have to take over the task that you think of as a journalist - either that or you play the dum@@ b . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t want to be asked : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what have you done in the face of so many dead men ... why didn &apos;t you tell what was going on ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Ri@@ odo@@ si@@ f team mis@@ ses Val@@ dez , the fun bird , who could flu@@ e like a do@@ ck@@ worker , a friend who was generous with hu@@ gs and advice , a teacher who knew how to survive .
they trusted in his routine .
he would always wear his hat .
he would always go to El Guay@@ ab@@ o , the bar opposite the office , and always sit at the same table there .
now they ask : was his love for routine his destruction ?
his death also forced them to question their own ass@@ umptions about how they can do their work best and stay alive .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they don &apos;t like it if you deal with their wives , their children , their clean shops , home starting and landing lanes &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to move drugs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; these things were not allowed , &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez .
the result is , even in the best times , a high degree of self @-@ cens@@ orship and self @-@ preservation .
trust his own inst@@ inc@@ ts .
if it sm@@ ells wrong , leave it away .
the anger is , the editor of the Ri@@ odo@@ ce Andr@@ es Vill@@ ar@@ real said that &quot; smell a sense that can be fo@@ ol@@ ed ... and then things happened to J@@ avier . &quot;
the old rules , as he and others say , are no longer valid in Sin@@ alo@@ a - just as in Tam@@ au@@ lip@@ as , Ver@@ ac@@ ru@@ z , Gu@@ err@@ ero and other states where a po@@ ison@@ ous mix of lu@@ cr@@ ative s@@ mu@@ g@@ gling routes , weak institutions and corrupt government officials are at home .
the landscape changes constantly .
in the room where the staff of Ri@@ odo@@ ce met for security training , no mobile phones suddenly were allowed . days before , Spy@@ ware , which is sold exclusively to governments , was used to monitor journalists and activists in Mexico .
outside , two polic@@ emen were looking for protection from the heat of 104 degrees ( 40 ° C ) in the shade of a tree .
they were commissioned by the provincial government to protect the offices of Ri@@ odo@@ ce in a four @-@ storey building in a mid @-@ class neighborhood of C@@ uli@@ ac@@ an .
half in the joke , some of the repor@@ ters asked whether these officers belonged to the 50 percent of the polic@@ emen who called the governor themselves as un@@ trust@@ worthy .
it is months since the repor@@ ters have gone to the mountain landscape where the drug gangs are de facto under control .
for the issue of this week Ri@@ odo@@ ce has fu@@ cked on three main stories .
there was the murder of the brother of the former well @-@ known speaker Juli@@ o C@@ esar Cha@@ vez in Sin@@ alo@@ a .
they also had an expos@@ é to the state expendi@@ tures concentrated on the home town of the governor .
and there was a group that went through a kidn@@ apping in one of the most expensive restaurants in C@@ uli@@ ac@@ an , a block from the Office of the Prosecutor .
there was no official word about who was kidn@@ apped or what happened , so be careful when it was time to write what everyone in town knows that the restaurant is a favorite local of drug dealers and authorities .
a repor@@ ter learned from public records that the restaurant was registered under the name of a politi@@ cian who ruled the governing Institu@@ tional Revolution Party ( PR@@ I ) , which dominated all political levels almost the whole century .
recently , several PR@@ I govern@@ ors were charged with high @-@ cali@@ ber cases of corruption .
Vill@@ ar@@ real asked the repor@@ ter to write about previous incidents in this local area , including one in which a son of &quot; El Ch@@ apo &quot; Gu@@ z@@ man escaped a military assault .
just a few months earlier , the readers would have viewed the Val@@ dez column as the best informed source of kidn@@ apping .
&quot; in the past we would have known what happened , &quot; said Vill@@ ar@@ real , 46 , with the nick@@ name &quot; El Fl@@ aco &quot; because of his slender body stat@@ ure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now all channels of communication with our sources are broken . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Val@@ dez &apos;s office became a storage room for signs and sti@@ ckers prot@@ esting against the kill@@ ings of journalists , because the employees have become something they never expected : activists in the name of the press .
repor@@ ter Mi@@ ri@@ am Ram@@ i@@ rez took a few signs and went next morning for a demonstration because of another journalist to the office of the prosec@@ utor .
Salvador Ad@@ ame disappeared three days after Val@@ dez had been killed in the western state of Mich@@ o@@ ac@@ an .
a burned body has been discovered and officials say , based on DNA testing that it is its .
in the whole country journalists have become ph@@ one@@ tic by writing down in organized protests &quot; S@@ OS Press &quot; on pav@@ ements and buildings .
on that day , the director Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez goes away in Washington and tries to collect international support for the judi@@ ci@@ ary in the case of Val@@ dez .
during a meeting with the governor of Sin@@ alo@@ a on the day following the assass@@ ination of Val@@ dez , Ram@@ i@@ rez accused the authorities of scor@@ ing journalists and killing them because they told the truth .
she has since then asked her to be re@@ group@@ ed by the government because she is concerned that her anger has viol@@ ated her obj@@ ectivity .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Val@@ dez had repeatedly said that journalists in Mexico were surrounded by organised crime , government officials and a valid society . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in his last book , &quot; Nar@@ co @-@ Journ@@ alism , &quot; he wrote that repor@@ ters were not only killed by drug gangs , but also on the command of politicians and security forces who were hiding under a blanket with organised crime .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the media guard group &quot; Ar@@ ticul@@ o 19 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has been assigned more than half of the attacks on journalists of the police and officials in the past year . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; in Mexico you die because they want you to keep your mouth , &quot; said Ram@@ i@@ rez .
obviously the kill@@ ings have a deter@@ rent effect .
no one for@@ gets the death of the blo@@ gger Maria Elizabeth M@@ aci@@ as in the northern border state Tam@@ au@@ lip@@ as six years ago .
your body was found together with a note that was allegedly signed by the Z@@ et@@ as bin : &quot; here I am because of my reports . &quot;
a computer keyboard and headphones were placed next to their separate head .
some branches have chosen to close , such as the newspaper El Nor@@ te in the northern border state Chi@@ hu@@ ah@@ ua after the assass@@ ination of correspon@@ dent Mi@@ ros@@ lava Bre@@ ach in March .
others continue to do as El Man@@ ana of Nu@@ evo Lar@@ edo did after the assass@@ ination of her director in 2004 .
in 2010 , the Di@@ ario de Ci@@ u@@ dad Ju@@ are@@ z publicly addressed the drug cart@@ els with an editorial on the title page entitled &quot; What do you want from us ? &quot;
some journalists have fled their home countries or even from the country .
it is a painful decision .
it &apos;s hard to find work in exile , and they still watch the streets and look for haz@@ ards .
and sometimes they are hun@@ ted , as evi@@ dently the photographer Ru@@ ben Esp@@ in@@ osa , who was murdered in 2015 together with four women in an apartment in Mexico City three months after the escape from Ver@@ ac@@ ru@@ z .
for those who stay behind and continue working , it is a daily dance with ris@@ ky decisions .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mexico goes to hell and therefore I became repor@@ ter , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at midnight on the last Friday , when the last issue was already finished , the editors of Ri@@ odo@@ ce sat on the side@@ walk in front of the office and d@@ rank beer when all their phones began to bu@@ zz .
a series of sho@@ ot@@ ings with belt riv@@ ets and security forces close to the Maz@@ at@@ lan bathing resort had left 19 confirmed dead .
the war continued escal@@ ating as promised by a series of cart@@ el em@@ bas@@ sies in the region .
from the edge of the cur@@ b you have published the news on the website of Ri@@ odo@@ ce on mobile phone .
the title page had to be changed the next day .
si@@ r@@ ens how@@ led nearby - another shooting in the area .
Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez threw a look at the polic@@ emen who kept guard to see if they were in readiness .
if they were afraid at all , they did not show it .
under the powerful portrait of the fallen founder of the newspaper , whose middle finger was visible to all of Sin@@ alo@@ a , the staff of Ri@@ odo@@ ce followed his tracks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how can you think about it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when J@@ avier was murdered on the same day , the train@@ ee asked me to send her for reporting on the road . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
din@@ osau@@ rs used clo@@ aking to ev@@ ade his enemies
at first sight it looks like a statue , al@@ beit a frigh@@ tening .
researchers have now discovered that the first findings of the incredible r@@ hin@@ oc@@ eros of a Canadian mountain worker have been so well received that experts have described it as &quot; Mon@@ a Lisa of the Din@@ osau@@ rs . &quot;
it was so good that they could even find that his fl@@ ak@@ y skin was red@@ dish brown - and they said she had had something of an &quot; troubled past . &quot;
the report in the journal &quot; Current Biology &quot; described him as &quot; the persistent buff@@ ered din@@ osau@@ r who has ever been found , and one of the best din@@ osau@@ rs in the world . &quot;
the fossil is a newly discovered species of No@@ dos@@ au@@ rier , living in the middle of the C@@ ret@@ ac@@ eous period between 110 million and 112 million years ago .
his incredibly well preserved condition has ba@@ ff@@ led researchers who describe it as &quot; truly remarkable . &quot;
according to National Ge@@ ographic reports , the ar@@ mor@@ ed her@@ bi@@ vor@@ ous e@@ ater is the best preserved fossil of its kind .
it was found by Sha@@ wn Funk when he du@@ g in the S@@ unc@@ or Mill@@ enium Mine near Fort Mc@@ Mur@@ ray in the north of Alber@@ ta , Canada on March 21 , 2011 .
he hit something out of the surrounding rock , and decided to look more closely .
the fossil discovered by him was sent to the Royal Ty@@ r@@ rel@@ l Museum of Pal@@ e@@ ont@@ ology .
they spent the next six years discovering the wild animal within the 2,500 pound ( 1,@@ 100 kg ) heavy earth cl@@ ump .
after all this hard work , the finished result is now ready to be revealed .
&quot; if you only b@@ link a bit with your eyes , you might almost believe that it slept , &quot; said the author Cal@@ eb Brown , scientist at the Royal Ty@@ r@@ rel@@ l Museum , where the creature is to be seen .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it will go into the history of science as one of the most beautiful and best preserved din@@ osau@@ rs - the Mon@@ a Lisa of the din@@ osau@@ r . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
researchers have discovered that these her@@ bi@@ vor@@ es , although covered with arm@@ or and resem@@ ble a shifting tank , probably have been threatened by car@@ ni@@ vor@@ ous din@@ osau@@ rs .
the heavily arm@@ oured din@@ osau@@ r used a red and white cam@@ ou@@ f@@ lage to hide from pre@@ dat@@ ors , and used a shiel@@ ding technique known as a counter@@ act that is also used by many modern animals .
this would have allowed us to better interfere with its surroundings and to ev@@ ade its enemies , experts say , suggest@@ ing that it was threatened by major din@@ osau@@ rs .
the 110 million years old creature from the No@@ dos@@ au@@ rier family has made head@@ lines in May and is now to be seen at the Royal Ty@@ r@@ rel@@ l Museum of Pal@@ ae@@ ont@@ ology .
researchers have now studied the wild animal and called it Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta mark@@ mit@@ ch@@ elli in accordance with the Museum technician Mark Mit@@ ch@@ ell , one of a team that spent more than 7@@ ,000 hours to discover it carefully .
the amazing preservation of the specimen made it possible for Dr. Mit@@ ch@@ ell and an international team of scientists to document the pattern and form of scales and arm@@ or over his body .
they discovered the sh@@ ading , a widespread defense method in the animal kingdom , which means that the top of the creature was dark@@ er than its under@@ side .
although the sh@@ ading is common , the results are surprising as the size of Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta by far exceeds the animals living today .
it points to the fact that din@@ osau@@ rs were driven from enough pressure by car@@ ni@@ vor@@ ous din@@ osau@@ rs that evolution fav@@ ored the conce@@ al@@ ment of the confrontation as a means of survival .
but most contemporary animals that use sh@@ ading - think of deer , zeb@@ ras or ar@@ ma@@ dil@@ los - are much smaller and more vulnerable than loo@@ t , which indicates that this No@@ where has been exposed to a real fight for survival .
&quot; strong pre@@ dat@@ or behavior on a massive , heavily arm@@ oured din@@ osau@@ r show how dangerous the din@@ osau@@ r pre@@ dat@@ ors must have been the chal@@ k time , &quot; Brown said .
chemical analysis of organic compounds in their scales also shows that the skin of the din@@ osau@@ r was bay .
scientists continue to investigate the animal on clu@@ es about his life , including his con@@ served intestinal content to find out what he has eaten as his last meal .
they believe that the din@@ osau@@ r , when he died , got caught up into a river and drove into the sea , where he sank on the back to the se@@ abed .
at that time , Alber@@ ta was as warm as Sou@@ fl@@ ori@@ da today , and rivers and oceans are probably far more widespread than they are today .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this No@@ dos@@ au@@ rier is really remarkable because it is completely covered with preserved sc@@ aly skin but remains intact in three dimensions and maintains the original shape of the animal , &quot; Brown said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the result is that the animal looks almost the same today as in the early C@@ ret@@ ac@@ eous period . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
you do not need to use a lot of imagination to re@@ construct it . if you only look a little with your eyes , you might almost believe that he is sleeping . &quot;
the C@@ ret@@ ac@@ eous period was a time when huge ther@@ op@@ ods , car@@ ni@@ vor@@ ous din@@ osau@@ r , that stood on two legs crossed the earth .
although the king of them , the Ty@@ ran@@ n@@ osau@@ rus Re@@ x lived millions of years after Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta , the arm@@ oured din@@ osau@@ r was hun@@ ted by some of his terri@@ fying ancestors .
this includes the ac@@ ro@@ can@@ th@@ osau@@ rus , a 38 foot ( 11.@@ 5 m ) long , six tons wei@@ ghty monster .
the scientists , whose latest findings appear in the journal Current Biology , believe that Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta sank after death in the sea and was m@@ um@@ i@@ fied in mud .
the creature was found by Sha@@ wn Funk , when he du@@ g in the S@@ unc@@ or Mill@@ enium Mine near Fort Mc@@ Mur@@ ray in the north of Alber@@ ta , Canada on March 21 , 2011 .
according to the museum it is the best @-@ preserved din@@ osau@@ r of the world , including skin and arm@@ or , and is completely from the mu@@ zzle to the hip .
the creatures were average about 18 feet ( 5 meters ) long and weigh@@ ed up to 3,000 pounds ( 1,@@ 300 kg ) .
it contained two 20 @-@ inch long tips , which prot@@ ru@@ ded from his shoulders .
the researchers believe that the ar@@ mor@@ ed her@@ bi@@ vor@@ es were swe@@ pt through the western Canada until a floo@@ ded river floo@@ ded it into the open sea .
but the underwater cre@@ mation of the din@@ osau@@ r kept his arm@@ or in exquisite detail .
the pet@@ ri@@ fied remains of this special specimen are so well preserved that the skin st@@ alli@@ ons always cover b@@ ump@@ y arm@@ oured boards along the din@@ osau@@ r
as Michael G@@ res@@ h@@ ko has written for National Ge@@ ographic , such a level of preservation is as &quot; rare as a win in the lot@@ tery .
the more I see it , the more conf@@ using it will .
pet@@ ri@@ fied remains of the skin still cover the b@@ ump@@ y ar@@ mor@@ ed plates that carry the skull of the animal .
his right foref@@ oot is on his side , his five fingers are spread upward .
I can count the d@@ and@@ ru@@ ff at its sole .
thunder@@ storm : mass ar@@ am@@ bol@@ age on A8 : many wounded
severe accident on Thursday evening on the A8 : almost 30 vehicles are involved in a mass ar@@ am@@ bol@@ age .
there are numerous wounded , miles long St@@ aus and G@@ aff@@ er .
on the Stuttgart @-@ Munich motorway ( A8 ) , about 20 people were injured in a mass ar@@ am@@ bol@@ age on the late Thursday afternoon .
according to the police , between the outlets Adel@@ z@@ hausen and O@@ del@@ z@@ hausen ( Land@@ kreis A@@ ich@@ ach @-@ Fried@@ berg ) during a thunder@@ storm were close to 30 vehicles , among them probably trucks .
there is no indication of the exact number of injuries .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a matter of slight to moderate injuries , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a police spokes@@ man . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a great deal of rescue vehicles was at the accident site .
the A8 was completely closed in the direction of Munich .
a round of ten kilometres long back was formed in the direction of travel in Munich .
as an A@@ Z repor@@ ter reports , it was also on the counter @-@ road to massive im@@ pedi@@ ments - by numerous G@@ aff@@ er .
the fire bri@@ g@@ ade noted the characteristics of the car drivers , which now have to be reck@@ oned with sensitive pen@@ alties .
shortly after 18 : 45 a second accident occurred on the A8 , this time between Augsburg and D@@ asing .
there was a collision between a car transpor@@ ter and a passenger car .
a rescue helicopter was on the way to the accident site .
Deutsche Bahn : group tests &quot; comfort check @-@ in &quot;
it &apos;s a moment that almost everyone has ever experienced : there is nothing to be found in the train and sleeping .
or one is deep@@ ened in his work and has just a brilliant mind .
and then : buff@@ ered .
comes the conductor and w@@ akes an un@@ gentle or ri@@ pping the passenger in the middle of the workflow .
ticket control .
but the times of interrup@@ tions are over .
the Deutsche Bahn is currently testing the job @-@ less ticket control .
you simply confirm by mobile phone that you have taken his place and de@@ valu@@ ables the ticket .
currently , a test operation is running on two routes .
&quot; if the offer arrives , we expand it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it will then be available at many other long @-@ haul routes in Germany at the beginning of next year , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a train spokesperson . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; comfort Check @-@ in &quot; is the name of the train card de@@ valuation without any conductor .
in order to be able to use it , however , some requirements must be met : you need a smartphone or tablet .
and you have to book an online ticket - what already most passengers do .
it is also necessary to have the app of the train which DB Navigator has purchased , which is anyway the most convenient way of ticket booking .
and last but not least , you need a seat reservation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; comfort check @-@ in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; works like this : you get into the train , call his ticket &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; My Tickets &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the test customers then have a button for electronic de@@ valuation .
the train atten@@ d@@ ants receive a message on their mobile devices that passenger X is in the train and has taken the seat Y .
if the train atten@@ dant arrives at PLA@@ Y ticket inspection , he knows that a passenger sits there with an already used online ticket .
so you can continue to sleep , work on , keep silent .
the &quot; check @-@ in &quot; has two advantages : one for the customer , one for the train - which in turn is intended to take advantage of passengers .
&quot; if you want to travel relaxed without ticket control by our train crew , simply check in the DB Navigator itself .
this enables passengers to make their travel time more personal in the train , &quot; says Michael Peter@@ son , DB &apos;s marketing management board .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; second Plus : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and our employees have more time than today to respond to individual customer needs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
those who often drive train know that in addition to delays and missed trains , ticket inspections are among the biggest off@@ ences .
because often one has , in any case , one of the contribut@@ ors not all the documents needed for the de@@ valuation of online tickets .
either the credit card or the identity card or otherwise a document you have to demonstrate .
the result is endless discussions between train atten@@ dant and passenger , leading to a bad mood in the compartment or big space and delays in controlling their own ticket and taking the conductor at the end of time to take care of other concerns .
only a small number of test customers can use the new service .
and that applies only to ICE 9@@ 15 Dortmund @-@ Stuttgart and ICE 9@@ 12 Stuttgart @-@ Essen .
other train numbers on the same route are not activated yet .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how an activ@@ ist came to learn the answer to the question : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Stre@@ ets ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on 9 August 2014 Britt@@ any Fer@@ rel@@ l was shaken to its core .
only one day after she arrived in New York City , she was sitting in St. Louis building on the bed of an Air@@ b@@ n@@ b apartment she rented and sc@@ rolled through Facebook on her phone .
she stum@@ bled across a post from someone from the High School .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the police have just killed a 18 year old child and it is still on the road , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said there . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
confused as no one else had posted the information on their feed , she closed Facebook and opened Twitter .
a user with the Hand@@ le @ The@@ e@@ Phar@@ o@@ ah was constantly saved on their tim@@ eline .
the ra@@ pper from the area of St. Louis was to twe@@ eter the death of Michael Brown , an un@@ armed black 18 @-@ year @-@ old , who was killed by a white polic@@ eman in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , Mo .
he posted an image of Brown &apos;s lifel@@ ess body , stretched out on the street and would stay there for four hours .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is wild , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Fer@@ rel@@ l thought about himself . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but death was nothing new to them and their community .
she set off her cell phone to return to T@@ we@@ et on the Can@@ field Drive later in the evening .
there were photos of the police band and people crying out , and from a man who claimed to be Brown &apos;s father who wore a sign with the inscription : &quot; F@@ erg@@ us@@ on &apos;s police has just killed my un@@ armed son ! &quot;
she observed a live feed in which a polic@@ eman was standing in front of a group of demonstr@@ ators with a bark@@ ing dog .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in another video , she said , another polic@@ eman said his ri@@ f@@ le and cried : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I will kill you ... animals all . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not usual , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; rec@@ alls Fer@@ rel@@ l to her statement . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not the type of murder that we have used to and which we can call typically . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at that moment I felt shi@@ vers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was angry and cried . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
she booked a return flight and went home the next day .
after the landing at 11@@ pm she took her 6 year old daughter from her father &apos;s house and decided that the two would drive to F@@ erg@@ us@@ on the next morning .
what happened in the next three years with Fer@@ rel@@ l and F@@ erg@@ us@@ on is the theme of a new documentary film , &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? , &quot; in cin@@ emas from the age of 11 .
it is a story of survival and protest , love and loss , strength and resistance that consists of the point of view of the people living in the community and filled the streets to demand answers .
when Fer@@ rel@@ l with her daughter , who wore a flower dress and a matching crown , drove to F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , the two discussed a conversation that they had &quot; over the black experience and the black state &quot; countless times before this morning .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you remember how I taught you when black people have to fight for what they believe ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she remembered what she said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are now going to F@@ erg@@ us@@ on because the police killed an 18 @-@ year @-@ old boy and that wasn &apos;t right . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I couldn &apos;t take them with me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Fer@@ rel@@ l later . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what has happened today is a high point of what happened in the past . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it must know and see it and be drawn up in it .
it must be well developed , not only activ@@ ism and organization , but also the various layers of black experience and the black constitution and what we have to do to free ourselves .
even though I &apos;m lucky enough to give her an experience in which she personally doesn &apos;t experience any bl@@ at@@ ant rac@@ ism , she is no different from the next black women &apos;s child .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I feel I would give her a bad service to keep her away from it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the first station , when they arrived in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , was located at the South Flor@@ iss@@ ant Road , a place opposite the police station , which became a camp area when the activists were waiting for the potential non @-@ charge of officer Dar@@ ren Wilson .
there Fer@@ rel@@ l and her daughter joined a local business owner who had lunch .
they prepared bags and helped to pass them on to demonstr@@ ators .
slowly a new kind of activ@@ ism began to take shape for Fer@@ rel@@ l .
&quot; my activ@@ ism changed completely after August 9 , &quot; she said and realized that she was a student at the University of Mis@@ sour@@ i @-@ St. Louis , President of the Min@@ ority Student Nur@@ ses Association and focused on food justice and health ine@@ qualities in black communities .
&quot; I had no experience in organizing .
it has all come . &quot;
weeks later , during an evening demonstration , Fer@@ rel@@ l met Sab@@ a@@ ah Fol@@ ay@@ an , one of the co @-@ directors of the film .
Fol@@ ay@@ an said she and her cam@@ er@@ aman Lucas Al@@ var@@ ado @-@ Far@@ ra@@ r wanted to &quot; document &quot; what happened .
a question came to Fer@@ rel@@ l in mind : &quot; do you want to document or try to find a story you can exploit ? &quot;
this scep@@ ticism was nour@@ ished by countless cases of people , often of wh@@ ites - in a community that benefited from their pain and their resili@@ ence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as Fol@@ ay@@ an recently said in an interview : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have heard that people born and raised in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on have not centered their voices and we wanted to do it differently . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Fol@@ ay@@ an had co @-@ worked with the then co @-@ director Dam@@ on Davis , an artist from the area known for his activ@@ ism around the death of death in@@ mates .
his involvement brought Fer@@ rel@@ l closer to the project , along with six other natives followed the team of &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? &quot; in the years after Brow@@ ns shooting .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this documentary is not someone who speaks for us or speaks to us . we &apos;re talking , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Davis . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was the main thing for me , as these people are portra@@ yed , for I will be represented . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the goal was not to concentrate on Ferr@@ is &apos;s experience - to show that the movement &quot; is not a Messiah @-@ leader , but a community that comes together , &quot; said Fol@@ ay@@ an - she proved to be the most open participant in the film .
as a result , documents of &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? &quot; surprising personal aspects of Ferr@@ ero &apos;s life as she falls in love and mar@@ ries her wife .
&quot; I felt like naked , &quot; Fer@@ rel@@ l said and laugh@@ ed when she saw the finished product for the first time .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I have understood that there must be a certain vulner@@ ability in this work and in the human@@ ization of black people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
furthermore , Ferr@@ is &apos;s history repe@@ ats the role of black gay women in the wider Black @-@ Li@@ ves @-@ Mat@@ ter movement .
two of the three founders of the Movement , who after killing the black teen@@ ager Tra@@ y@@ von Martin in 2012 marked the film &quot; Black@@ Li@@ ves@@ Mat@@ ter &quot; in social media , identify themselves as gay .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; black , gay women in leadership positions have carried the movement altogether , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Fer@@ rel@@ l , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and therefore we are constantly fighting on different fron@@ ts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; black gay women must wear the main burden of everything . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Fol@@ ay@@ an agreed to note that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the movement really is held upright by black women and many black women . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , it insi@@ sts that &quot; this is not an affir@@ m@@ ative type of action , &quot; when Fer@@ rel@@ l was chosen as the heart of the film because of her identity .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she was the person who th@@ rows this energy , &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is not a coinci@@ dence , although it was at the front , because in a life at these cross@@ roads as a black gay woman there is so much on the game . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can feel their energy through the screen . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
meanwhile , the news cameras in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on have long disappeared , but the ra@@ cial connections between the municipality and the police continue to exist .
Fer@@ rel@@ l is on par@@ ole for 2 ½ years because of blocking a highway at a demonstration .
she describes the socio @-@ political atmosphere of the area she calls her home : &quot; chaos . &quot;
nevertheless she cl@@ ings to a song and she feels committed to this memory since she went to the streets three years ago in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on .
&quot; it is our duty to fight for our freedom .

from &quot; Dream &quot; to &quot; meg@@ al@@ om@@ ania &quot; : TV readers discuss about bit gallery
the bit gallery moves people even though it has not been built for a long time .
but the idea of a shopping centre at the south end of the pedestrian zone has been spl@@ itting the population into advoc@@ ates and opponents since the first presentation in 2009 .
cold the subject hardly leaves one .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on our Facebook page &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Volks@@ fre@@ und Bit@@ burg &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the topic is discussed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
while some say to the bit gallery : &quot; that would be a dream &quot; ( An@@ ja Becker ) or &quot; That &apos;s really great &quot; ( Nicole Schau@@ sten ) , comes from the other side : &quot; no man &quot; ( Sig@@ gi B@@ etzen ) or simply : &quot; meg@@ al@@ om@@ ania ! &quot; ( Lars Sch@@ olz ) .
while the advoc@@ ates build that a gallery attracts more customers into the city , from which the rest of the shops will benefit , the opponents fear that the pedestrian zone will ble@@ ed out .
in addition , the gallery is planned exactly on the property on which the farmer &apos;s market hall stands , in which 13 direct market@@ ers offer their products .
at the beginning of the construction work it will be concluded .
the gallery owners want to integrate a market hall into the new building - for Bed@@ a @-@ Platz , with possibility to sit outside .
Sim@@ one Rooms : &quot; we have been shopping in the farmers market almost every week for many years .
chi@@ ef@@ ly our eggs , but also the delicious cakes of the con@@ cu@@ bin@@ es always gladly again .
we also discovered the but@@ cher &apos;s shop for us .
we would like to see that even during and above all after the construction of the gallery there is a chance to maintain this offer .
in other cities , too .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; especially the small market hall in Frankfurt is interesting . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ger@@ d D@@ ens@@ ing : &quot; whether direct marketing is located in a market hall in the gallery , depends on the amount of rent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the new project should probably not be very low . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Eva K@@ ili@@ c : &quot; why shopping bags in Bit@@ burg ?
whether clothes , shoes , dru@@ g@@ stores or supermarkets , I think that &apos;s superf@@ lu@@ ous .
there are enough of them in our city .
you can see how many shops are empty here - some for months and years .
but since there is not even a weekly market here , it is all the more important that at least the market hall is preserved .
after all , the product offered there is fresh , is mostly offered directly by the producer and is cheap at the top .
as you can see , retail stores in a shopping centre are only rented by larger companies , because the rent there is often not portable for a retail@@ er .
too bad , specialty shops are almost no longer and what remains of it will probably disappear . &quot;
Wolf Fan@@ del : &quot; a shopping centre with a market hall doesn &apos;t fit for me .
and the gallery does not fit to Bit@@ burg .
first of all : where is the peasant market hall going to be during the construction period ?
the old E@@ de@@ ka would be the solution - even in the long run if the bit gallery actually comes in .
or does the gh@@ ost@@ st bit gallery already manage to remove all shops from Bit@@ burg ? &quot;
George Mar@@ quet : &quot; that won &apos;t work .
and a shopping center that stands empty needs no one .
in my opinion it would have been better to promote a real farmer &apos;s market instead of this gallery .
but for a farmer &apos;s market hall , thanks to the ins@@ an@@ ely many - as I find , there is no place in Bit@@ burg for sen@@ sel@@ ess construction projects .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when the farmers market hall is destroyed , a piece of culture will disappear again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a matching simil@@ arity : artist creates portraits with Chelsea Mann@@ ing DNA
in the middle of the space of the Fri@@ d@@ man Gallery in New York many faces are to be seen - white , black and brown , which are almost im@@ percep@@ tible - hanging on cables from the ceiling .
the 30 portraits were created by the artist He@@ ather De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg from W@@ angen @-@ Tu@@ pf@@ ern and hair segments that were sent to her by Chelsea Mann@@ ing .
Mann@@ ing sent the excer@@ pts from Fort Le@@ aven@@ worth prison , where the former secret service analy@@ st served a 35 @-@ year prison sentence after having publi@@ ci@@ zed diplomatic reports on Wiki@@ Le@@ aks website .
the new exhibition opened on 2 August is called A Bec@@ oming resem@@ b@@ lance ( A matching simil@@ arity ) .
she is the product of two years correspondence between De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg , whose discipline combined her expertise in technology , computer science and art , and Mann@@ ing , a Trans@@ woman and dissi@@ dent dissi@@ dent , whose conviction was transformed by Barack Obama when he had only three days in office .
De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg has been created by algorith@@ mic analysis of DNA that was extracted from Mann@@ ing and created from the 30 portraits , such as someone with these gen@@ om@@ ic data , a sharp , though some intellectual commentary , not only to the form of DNA data - the many ways how they can be interpreted and the inherent determin@@ ism of these interpretations - but also for identity .
Mann@@ ing , who was born when Brad@@ ley Edward but already spoke openly about identification as a woman since her pu@@ ber@@ ty , was sentenced to 20 charges in 2013 , including six violations of the es@@ pion@@ age law , computer fraud and theft .
through the prison her picture was supp@@ ressed , so much that there was only one photo - a gra@@ iny , black @-@ white sel@@ f@@ ie , in which Mann@@ ing was visi@@ bly sitting on a driver &apos;s seat and wearing a plat@@ inum @-@ blonde wig - with whom she was associated .
in 2015 , De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg was just about the great success of her 2012 project &apos; Stran@@ ger Visi@@ ons &apos; .
the artist produced portraits of strangers from for@@ en@@ sic arti@@ facts such as cigarette but@@ ts and ch@@ ewing gum by extrac@@ ting DNA from waste to produce a picture of how these people could look .
this was the time she received an e @-@ mail from a newspaper magazine .
&quot; they performed an interview with Chelsea Mann@@ ing while she was in prison and they wanted a kind of portrait to accompany this article , &quot; said De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg at a press preview of the new exhibition .
and she couldn &apos;t be visited at that time and she could not be photograph@@ ed , so you got in touch with Chelsea and asked her if she wanted to make a DNA portrait .
the artist and her incar@@ cer@@ ated mice were turned into un@@ equal spectac@@ les , which in the course of two years exchanged several letters .
they even created a Com@@ ic &quot; Supp@@ ressed Images &quot; com@@ ic illustrated by Sho@@ il@@ i Kan@@ ung@@ o , which fores@@ aw a future in which the president would convert Chel@@ ny &apos;s judgment and it would be able to see the exhibition in person .
the fact that Obama was actually only a few days after the book was published to call Mann@@ ing &apos;s release after seven brutal years in a military prison in K@@ ans@@ as was a welcome kind of happy meeting .
there is also now something deep and strong at the opening of the exhibition , as Donald Tr@@ ump leads a war against in@@ forman@@ ts from the government camp and against Trans@@ gender troops , in order to find new , twe@@ et@@ able paths to further infl@@ ame the rigid divisions that he was supposed to correct .
when De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg was asked about the strange timing of all these things , she said that &quot; things are going to happen for a certain reason . &quot;
in a artistic statement written on the wall of the gallery Mann@@ ing called with her over@@ sized signature among them ( the &quot; i &quot; in her family name is marked with a heart ) an end of &quot; automatic frag@@ mentation , the basis of gender , race , sexu@@ ality and culture . &quot;
on the opposite wall , their mit@@ och@@ on@@ dri@@ al DNA sequence - a thous@@ and@@ th of Cs and Gs and As , is written in pencil .
De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg hoped to show through the inclusion of the 200 letters ( or nucle@@ oti@@ des after the highly developed scientific dictionary of the artist ) , as amaz@@ ingly similar , at least in organic ways , we are all .
&quot; what people will hopefully take with them is that our gen@@ ome does not care about who we are and how openly genetic data are for an interpretation and how subjective they are , &quot; said De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg , whose video work from 2007 , Sp@@ uri@@ ous Mem@@ ories , is also to be seen .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; DNA data can tell so many different stories , therefore these are 30 of these stories . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the last piece in the exhibition , which is stored in a separate room , is a page from the above @-@ mentioned com@@ ic novel .
she shows Mann@@ ing as she appears with a hands @-@ free phone in his hand from the bar@@ racks of the United States like King Kong .
&quot; when they make your speech cold , they have won , &quot; it says .
&quot; so never stop the mouth . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it came directly from a letter that she wrote to me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the artist , who gre@@ ets from Philadelphia . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I still get go@@ ose bum@@ ps when I talk about it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mann@@ ing has not yet seen the exhibition personally - just as it was anticipated in the com@@ ic book - but if she should do it , then she will be greeted in the middle of the room by the masks , from her own gen@@ om@@ ic simul@@ ac@@ res , who assemble like hor@@ des of prot@@ esters .
this was also target @-@ oriented , like everything in the exhibition , up to the size ( 5 &quot; 2 , Mann@@ ing St@@ atur ) , in which her genetic hap@@ lo@@ groups were written with pencil .
&quot; in the past , I had them on the wall , but I wanted them to feel like a crowd , &quot; said De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg of portraits .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I wanted it to feel like a mass movement that formed with Chelsea , like the movement that was also behind its liberation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Professor of the University of Nor@@ th@@ western and an associate at Oxford University for murder
a nation @-@ wide man hunt is underway for a professor at Nor@@ th@@ western University and an employee at Oxford University who are looking for susp@@ ects after a man was stab@@ bed in a luxurious apartment in Chicago with deadly injury .
on Monday , for W@@ yn@@ d@@ ham La@@ them ( 42 ) and Andrew War@@ ren ( 56 ) arrest warran@@ ts were issued on account of their alleged involvement in the death of Tr@@ enton H James Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au , as the acts of the Local Court of Cook County are showing .
the documents say Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au , 26 , died after several stit@@ ches .
a common warning system published by the Chicago police authority states that the body was discovered on 27 July .
officials received a call , arrived at the Grand Plaza Apartments and found the victim with several injuries to his body .
Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au was declared dead on the spot and det@@ ectives investigate the stit@@ ches as murder , while the police actively seek the two susp@@ ects , said public officials .
La@@ a has been an associate Professor of Micro@@ biology and Immun@@ ology at the Nor@@ th@@ western University since 2007 .
Alan K. Cu@@ b@@ bin , vice @-@ president for university relations , said in an e @-@ mail statement that he was now in absence and had been excluded from entering the campus of Nor@@ th@@ western University .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is now a criminal matter investigated by the competent authorities , and Nor@@ th@@ western University co @-@ operates with this investigation , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Cu@@ b@@ bin . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
War@@ ren is Senior Treas@@ ury Assistant at Oxford University .
a spokes@@ man at the University and Somer@@ ville College said in an email explanation that &quot; we are in contact with the police in the UK and ready to help U.S. investig@@ ators in any way possible . &quot;
the statement added that War@@ ren &apos;s colleagues were shocked and want him to stand .
chief Communications Officer of the Chicago Police Department , Anthony Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi , said he strongly urged the susp@@ ects to submit to the authorities .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the police have an idea of their where@@ ab@@ outs , and our efforts to locate them strengthen themselves , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said that local , regional and national authorities are helping to find the susp@@ ects .
Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said the police received a call from the building manager of the Grand @-@ Plaza building , who had just received a mysterious tip saying that something had happened in apartment 10@@ 08 .
the police described the scene as very cruel .
Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said it was unclear whether the incident occurred on 27 July .
it was confirmed by security cameras that La@@ them@@ ed and War@@ ren were in the building .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we believe Professor L@@ ath@@ am and the victim had a relationship , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the management team of Grand Plaza published an explanation to the inhabitants : &quot; the police are currently working on the tim@@ eline and the background of the victim and investig@@ ates a variety of motives , including a possible home incident . &quot;
&quot; we will conclude the WA@@ DA schedule in the near future , &quot; the Russian Vice President Mut@@ ko
Russian Deputy Prime Minister Vital@@ y Mut@@ ko said that it will not take long before the remaining criteria of the World Anti @-@ Dop@@ ing Agency ( WA@@ DA ) will be implemented for the restoration of the Russian Anti @-@ Dop@@ ing Agency ( R@@ US@@ A@@ DA ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at a certain stage of fulfilling the criteria of the road@@ map , R@@ US@@ A@@ DA has the right to plan and test in cooperation with U@@ K@@ AD ( UK Anti @-@ Dop@@ ing ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the WA@@ DA road@@ map was updated in this respect , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mut@@ ko on Thursday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the PM commented on the second part of the WA@@ DA schedule for compliance with the code that describes the criteria for the re @-@ establishment of R@@ US@@ A@@ DA and was recently published on the organization &apos;s website .
according to Mut@@ ko , he doesn &apos;t include anything that could cause concern for Russia .
&quot; everything has been announced , everything is being implemented .
and the results will be presented to the International Olympic Committee ( IO@@ C ) and WA@@ DA in the near future , &quot; he added .
however , one of the criteria listed in the list specifies that the Russian anti @-@ dop@@ ing authorities must publicly accept the reported results of the investigation approved by the Canadian lawyer Richard Mc@@ L@@ aren on alleged state funded dop@@ ing in Russian sports .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in terms of the matter , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we carry out the investigation , as our anti @-@ dop@@ ing system has made a mistake . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
all measures have been implemented .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but there were no state programs , and we won &apos;t admit anything that does not exist . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
mother &apos;s words coinci@@ ded with those of Vital@@ y Sm@@ ir@@ no@@ v , the head of the independent Russian Anti @-@ Dop@@ ing Commission .
in conversation with the Russian sales office r@@ sport at the beginning of the day , Sm@@ ir@@ no@@ v had problems of the past in Russian anti @-@ dop@@ ing organizations , but added : &quot; we have repeatedly said that the report contains controversial positions and regulations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no one has to accept this report un@@ condition@@ ally , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sm@@ ir@@ no@@ v added . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
R@@ US@@ A@@ DA was excluded from the implementation of dop@@ ing controls in Russia in November 2015 as part of the Dop@@ ing Sk@@ and@@ als of the WA@@ DA .
however , you were allowed to plan and coordinate testing under the supervision of international experts and the UK Anti @-@ Dop@@ ing ( U@@ K@@ AD ) .
after a visit to Moscow &apos;s headquarters in July , WA@@ DA General Director Oli@@ vier Nig@@ gli declared that R@@ US@@ A@@ DA is moving &quot; in the right direction &quot; in order to be used again .

the start @-@ ups that will help your company not become the next U@@ ber
A@@ my Er@@ ret@@ t wanted to measure luck with your e @-@ commerce start @-@ up , but the surveys did not work .
responses were often vag@@ ue , little helpful or - worse - dec@@ eit@@ ful .
and even if you promised anonym@@ ity , some workers did not trust the process .
&quot; there was simply never consistency and obj@@ ectivity , &quot; said Er@@ ret@@ t who runs the 75 @-@ person San Francisco e @-@ Commerce Hair Care Company Ma@@ dison Re@@ ed .
she has called people from outside for help .
a new breed of Human Resources start @-@ ups is on the grow to help companies find out how their employees feel .
by creating and licensing software that has the specific purpose of measuring employee engagement , it allows companies to perform surveys , to offer special groups and demographic groups , to address employees anonym@@ ity and complaint hot@@ lines , and in some cases allow W@@ hist@@ le@@ blo@@ wers to circum@@ vent the C @-@ Suite managers and turn directly to the Board of Directors .
&quot; you now have tools like Stra@@ va and Fit@@ bit for tracking your health , but where &apos;s the Fit@@ bit for your company ? &quot; said Jim Bar@@ nett , co @-@ founder and Chief Executive of Red@@ wood City Start @-@ up G@@ lin@@ t , whose software analytics tools are used by companies to measure employee engagement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Er@@ ret@@ t said she had a better insight into what your employees think and feel in the three years with G@@ lin@@ t . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition to the Sn@@ ap surveys and surveys of specific teams , it provides a heat card of the company that shows at a glance which units have most complaints and which managers have low cons@@ ents results - so that you can re@@ boot why .
companies are coming to see that they have to remain at the top of the workplace culture so that you won &apos;t be the next U@@ ber who has been involved in sc@@ and@@ als since a former employee has published a blog post that describes an environment of nu@@ is@@ ance where those who have spoken have been punished .
for start @-@ ups such as G@@ lin@@ t , this wish is an overview of a lu@@ cr@@ ative business opportunity .
global governance , regulation and compliance sector could have more than $ 1@@ 18.@@ 7 billion in 2020 , according to the finance @-@ technical website Let &apos;s Talk Pay@@ ments .
Den@@ ver , Colorado , Start @-@ up Con@@ ver@@ cent , the company helps to prevent and detect bad behavior , saw an increasing interest and activity beginning of this year amid the U@@ ber F@@ all in Mis@@ sk@@ re@@ dit .
cent has almost 600 clients including Air@@ b@@ n@@ b , Microsoft and Tes@@ la .
u@@ ber has recently signed up as a client .
as G@@ lin@@ t , Con@@ ver@@ cent lets companies send custom &quot; pulse &quot; surveys , collect sensitive answers in real time and view the heat maps of your problem areas .
it also offers an anonymous SMS hot@@ line that allows employees to report bad behavior .
and if the chief executive officer is involved , complaints go directly to the Supervisory Board .
&quot; public opinion has seized the regul@@ ators , &quot; said Patrick Qu@@ in@@ lan , the founder and CEO of Con@@ ver@@ cent .
if a company is found that treats its employees badly or behave eth@@ ically , it can experience costly consequences by consumers boy@@ cot@@ t , employee fluctu@@ ation and complaints , said Qu@@ in@@ lan .
ruby Tuesday , the restaurant chain with more than 25,000 employees and more than 500 sites , has appointed Con@@ ver@@ cent for more than a year to ensure that employees are aware of the policies and procedures and have an easy way to reach their corporate headquarters .
previously , if an employee wanted to report a problem , he or she had to find a telephone number or email for the company headquarters , submit a formal complaint and hope he was taken seriously .
it was often a timi@@ dation and uncomfortable experience , said James Vit@@ rano , Ru@@ by Tu@@ es@@ days General Coun@@ sel , who said there was no good way to track the complaints of employees .
now that the company employs Con@@ ver@@ cent , problems that previously have been hidden by executives who were sitting in offices in cities or states were hidden - such as discrimination , har@@ ass@@ ment or unfair inter@@ ns faster and addressed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I can approach this holistic , 360 @-@ degree view into the experience with employment , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Vit@@ rano , who runs the Risk Management Group of Ru@@ by Tuesday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and we protect our shareholders from employment disputes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
companies began to take Eth@@ ics , Val@@ ues and Emplo@@ ye@@ es &apos; involvement in 2002 , after the accounting firm Arthur Ander@@ sen collap@@ sed because of ethical violations due to the En@@ ron sc@@ andal , Qu@@ in@@ lan said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but it took until the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; social media came to their right &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that companies realized that they could not prevent their dirty laundry being online . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before using technology to monitor ethics , people used hope as a strategy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
both G@@ lin@@ t and Con@@ ver@@ cent offer your software as a service , and charge the companies with recurring charges for the use of their products .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a business model and a chance that will find the approval of Venture Capital Invest@@ ors who have supported both start @-@ ups . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
conver@@ se received $ 10 million in funding in February by companies such as S@@ apphire Vent@@ ures and T@@ ola Capital , which raised the total capital to $ 47 million .
gl@@ itz@@ ers secured $ 10 million in November of B@@ ess@@ emer Venture Partners and raised its total funding to $ 60 million .
these investments are hardly surprising , given the connected nature of companies , culture and venture capital .
there is a growing research complex that shows that today &apos;s employees expect more from their jobs than before .
competitive markets such as Si@@ licon Valley are high sal@@ aries and interesting projects only .
the employees want the feeling that you are accepted and appreciated and that you give your time to a company with a positive mission .
&quot; when people are happy to be in a company that is their voices , and that the work they do is worthwhile , then they feel more committed to making this company successful , &quot; said Nina Mc@@ Queen , Vice President of Global Ben@@ ef@@ its and Emplo@@ ye@@ e Experience at Link@@ ed@@ In , both Con@@ ver@@ cent and G@@ lin@@ t .
investors can achieve yields when their portfolio companies run well . companies are running well when employees are committed and committed .
when the analytics tools of third parties promise to increase commitment and commitment of employees , it is no wonder that you will find support .
the data on employee engagement according to the experts of workplace culture is important .
but the data is useless if the administrators of a company do not take action .
in fact , when a company asks staff for your feedback , it may have an expectation that change is on the way .
and if the change does not come quickly enough , or not at all , this dis@@ appointment can grow and hire employees .
&quot; if you ask for 4,000 suggestions , you &apos;ll have to be willing to have 4,000 talks , &quot; said Rus@@ sell Ra@@ ath , President of Consulting at the Business Management firm Kot@@ ter International , who has seen companies that have reli@@ ed too much on collecting data .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for if you will not follow employees , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Do you really listen to me ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
do you care about it ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and if you don &apos;t care about why I should ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ma@@ dison Re@@ ed , who now performs monthly employee surveys , was able to initiate actions on the same day if a problem is reported on G@@ lin@@ t , so ret@@ t .
and after collecting feedback from frustr@@ ated employees , it was able to re@@ organize several teams within the company and add a communication training to address the problems .
in Ru@@ by Tuesday , the company gets new insights into the employees , and it hopes that in the long run , this leads to a better engagement of employees in a sector that is known for high turnover .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you are not obliged to create a culture of transparency , you will lose people , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Vit@@ rano . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and if you lose people , you will lose customers too . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and if you lose customers , then you will lose company .

some have pulled out their tri@@ cot parts and show the back full of sweat from the first day of the training camp .
for a good part of the team , these minutes represent a lunch break .
players who are en@@ rolled in summer courses will return to their final audi@@ ts after the three hour practice before they return to the Water@@ man Football Center next morning at 6 : 30 .
&quot; this is a real treadmill for the boys the next three days , &quot; said Bru@@ ins @-@ Trainer Jim Mor@@ a shortly before Monday to Tuesday .
the N@@ CA@@ A eliminates two @-@ day exercises to ease the load of the players , and she has actually extended her days - at least until the final on Friday .
for this reason , the first three training sessions of the U@@ C@@ LA should begin at 7 : 15 p.m. in order to meet the already packed timet@@ ables of the players .
the compromise between the two days is more than a day at which the Bru@@ ins postpon@@ ed the start of the camp almost a week after the last season and during the summer school for the first time during Mor@@ as performing six playing times in West@@ wood practical exercises .
they are supposed to hold 18 exercises over the course of August . 20 before the beginning of the formal game preparations for their pr@@ el@@ ude to Texas A &amp; M in September .
Mor@@ a said that he supports the change of rules of the N@@ CA@@ A , even if they add another point to the busy routes of the players .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we put this enormous strain on it three or four days , and it is very challenging , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mor@@ a . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and they simply pushed it through , they went on plac@@ em@@ ing , they &apos;re great people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think once we come to Saturday and we have more time , it &apos;s really great . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the U@@ C@@ LA will end its practice as soon as the camp is finished , which is due to the clear lines of its fields from an adjacent car park and adjacent Lus@@ kin Center , a hotel belonging to the up@@ scale class , which has already been e@@ du@@ ed with foot@@ balls , which will be a protective net behind a door@@ posts , no easy task will be .
Bru@@ ins players should occupy the hotel from this weekend but Mor@@ a admitted that there could be a problem as soon as these rooms are free during the season .
&quot; we will use our security , &quot; said Mor@@ a .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a real problem , and it &apos;s not far to think that people are renting a room there and then set out to record an exercise . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if you have the video tape of an exercise , it &apos;s a pretty good deal .
but we have security forces there and we have security forces on parking 8 .
we will do the best with what we have .
that &apos;s why I don &apos;t worry too much about that .
we have a plan . &quot;
Facebook wants to intensi@@ fy facts verification in combat counter@@ f@@ eit messages
Facebook wants to send more potential articles with false reports to third parties fake reports and display their results below the original contribution , said the world &apos;s largest online social network on Thursday . it is one of his efforts to fight so @-@ called fake news .
the company said in a statement on his website that it will begin with the use of updated mechanical learning methods to identify possible false messages and to send them to fac@@ tual audi@@ tors that may display results of the fact test from the original article .
Facebook has been critic@@ ised as one of the main distribution points for so @-@ called fake news , many of whom believe that they have also influenced the 2016 US presidential elections .
the problem has also become a major political issue in Europe , with the French voters being floo@@ ded with false stories in the run @-@ up to the presidential elections in May , and Germany is supporting a plan to be punished according to social media networks if they fail to quickly eradic@@ ate hate @-@ filled posts as before the elections there in September .
on Thursday Facebook spoke in a separate statement in German that a test of the new facts review will be launched in the USA , France , the Netherlands and Germany .
&quot; in addition to finding out which stories are challenged by third parties factor supervis@@ ors , people want more context to make informed decisions about what they read and share , &quot; said Sara S@@ u , Product Manager for Facebook news in a blog .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she added that Facebook will continue to test its feature on the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; related article &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and is working on other changes to its news feed to reduce false messages . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
creating a com@@ ic novel : a castle in the history of England
in his recent past , the little Scot@@ ney castle was to be seen in a squee@@ ze music video and was a lo@@ op@@ hole for Margar@@ et T@@ hat@@ cher in the 1970 &apos;s and 1980 &apos;s .
but Scot@@ ney has experienced 700 years of turbul@@ ent history from his comfortable seat in the Ir@@ l River valley in K@@ ent and now has become an inspiration for a graphic novel by Jamie Rho@@ des , a cos@@ mop@@ olitan Yor@@ k@@ shi@@ re@@ man with a preference for historical documents .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think it &apos;s so nice to look at the hand@@ writing of someone who has been dead for 300 years , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says bol@@ dly . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what a personal relationship to hold this letter in my hand . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&apos;@@ A Castle in England &apos; sp@@ ans the time from the Middle Ages to the age of Edward and documents the families living in Scot@@ ney . each story was illustrated by another , emerging British artist - Isaac Ste@@ ie@@ wi@@ cz , William Ex@@ ley , Beck@@ y Pal@@ mer and Is@@ abel Gre@@ enberg .
it is not the first book of Rho@@ des , which is based on an archive : it wrote in 2014 &apos; Dead Men &apos;s Te@@ eth and Other Stories &apos; , a collection inspired by documents in the British Library - a project that he found un@@ expect@@ edly emotional .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I only re@@ acted to the thumb@@ print on the side of a letter that was written by a double agent in the 1700 &quot; s &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; this is his thumb @-@ print !
and letters always smell of smoke , for at that time a fire was kind@@ led because of the light .
for someone who lives 300 years later , the smell has an effect as if he were himself .
Oh , I love archives ! &quot;
for someone who is so beaten with old papers that he is supported by the National Trust and the Arts Council England and lived almost four months in a castle ( &quot; To be honest : I have over@@ rated my Welcome @-@ greeting a little &quot; ) seems to be all too beautiful to be true .
Rho@@ des spent his days exploring the Victori@@ an &quot; new &quot; castle , viewing the archives , and studying the many treasures and curi@@ osi@@ ties of the castle , such as the mo@@ ons of hy@@ ena on the walls and the bottles that had spent centuries in the dit@@ ch .
he wander@@ ed through the grounds and the ruins of the old castle and spoke with landscape care , gardening and sometimes with the artists who worked on the illustrations of his book .
then at night he d@@ rank &quot; Whis@@ key and started to write . &quot;
the intimate history of Scot@@ ney is relatively unknown , as the National Trust gained full access only in 2006 , when the last heir , Elizabeth Hus@@ sey , died .
when Rho@@ des arrived a decade later , the employees began to take care of the archive , which he described as &quot; hundreds of years in which aristoc@@ rats said , &quot; Oh , cast it down on the attic . &quot;
di@@ aries , letters from the time of the English Empire , cards that represent what possessed it : &quot; one could think that land conflicts would be boring , &quot; says Rho@@ des , &quot; but there was a bir@@ ch fighting the two families .
guys , let &apos;s go all the way ! &quot;
some of the stories in the collection use the castle as a starting point to immer@@ se themselves in English history , among them &apos; The Lab@@ our@@ er &apos; , who follows a man who leaves the newly built castle to join the peasant uprising of 13@@ 81 .
&quot; there is a record of a rebellion , which appeared in the castle in 13@@ 80 , in this book titled &apos; Kni@@ gh@@ tly Famili@@ es of K@@ ent and Sus@@ sex &apos; , says Rho@@ des .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the peasant uprising began in this area and I thought that an insurrection was a good start . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; maybe they are connected with each other ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
other stories are firmly rooted in the history of the castle - like &apos; The Pri@@ est &apos; , which tells the story of the Jesu@@ it Pat@@ tern that the Dar@@ rel@@ l family hid for seven years during the English Reformation .
or &apos; The S@@ mu@@ gg@@ ler &apos; , in which the s@@ mu@@ gg@@ ler Arthur Dar@@ rel@@ l was portra@@ yed from the 18th century , who staged his own funeral by filling a coff@@ in with stones ( a discovery that was made only years later when his coff@@ in was excav@@ ated ) .
the dar@@ r@@ ells are Rho@@ des &apos; favorite family of Scot@@ ney : &quot; the gent@@ lemen seemed to be quite Ga@@ un@@ er , always making debts and spending money on things they could not afford .
other generations of Dar@@ rel@@ l men solved their debt crisis by mar@@ rying rich old women - I imagine them as a he@@ ap of well @-@ looking boys , with a talent to promote land@@ lords . &quot;
after the end of his use in the castle Rho@@ des is searching for other unique writing experiences
he has spent a two week stay in the Finnish wilderness for a com@@ ic novel about E@@ lä@@ mä@@ ki , the terrain of a san@@ atorium from the early 20th century , which has since been rec@@ laimed by nature .
but Scot@@ ney has a special place for him .
&quot; I was sad to go back , &quot; he says .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was like : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Oh , now I have to get ready again with the dam@@ ned life . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
campaign launched : over 300 years old Mari@@ enk@@ ap@@ elle veiled in Rh@@ ön@@ dorf
with the inauguration of the 301 @-@ year @-@ old Mari@@ enk@@ ap@@ elle in Rh@@ ön@@ dorf , the city of Bad Hon@@ ne@@ f launched its campaign on Friday to introduce a new umbrella brand ( Rund@@ schau from Thursday ) .
until Thursday , mayor Otto Neu@@ hoff and his marketing team around Nelson Ar@@ tz want to keep the logo and slogan secret .
at the end of August there will be a feast on the island of Gra@@ fen@@ wer@@ th as the highlight of the campaign .
&quot; too nice for us .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the makers of the action since yesterday asked the posters at the Rh@@ ön@@ dorfer chapel . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we don &apos;t really think that ( of course ! ) , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they write on their website which was released yesterday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but we use this measure to attract your attention . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and to make it clear that some things are better than it seems .
basically , we are firmly convinced that as Bad Hon@@ ne@@ fer , we are very well aware of the beauty and attrac@@ tiveness of our city . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in action , it is more than &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; just &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a logo and a slogan , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is important to form@@ ulate an all @-@ encomp@@ assing promise , one that gives the city a unique selling proposition . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after all , she stands in competition with other municipalities .
the city of Bad Hon@@ ne@@ f will cost a medium five @-@ digit amount due to its new umbrella brand and campaign .
military reforms in Turkey - Erdo@@ gan &apos;s fear of the army
every year at the beginning of August , the Supreme Military Council ( Y@@ AS ) consul@@ ts in Ankara on reti@@ rements and promotions in the officer cor@@ ps .
so also this week .
at first glance , a normal process .
but nothing is routine in the Turkish armed forces one year after attempted coup attempt .
the meeting was held no longer in the building of the General Staff , as previously , but in the pres@@ idency of the Prime Minister .
at the meetings of the He@@ ads of State , the five Vice @-@ Pres@@ idents and the Minister for Defence , Home Affairs , Justice and Foreign Affairs took part in the discussions .
thus , the civilians in the Y@@ AS were in number .
the government is pulling the re@@ ins in the military .
the Chief of Staff , Hul@@ us@@ i Ak@@ ar , remains in office , but the officers of the army , the forces of air and the Navy were dismissed .
since the failed coup , President Erdo@@ gan 169 has fired the 3@@ 26 gener@@ als and admir@@ als .
more than 10,000 soldiers were removed from the ranks of the army - mostly because of alleged connections to the movement of the exile pre@@ acher Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len , the Erdo@@ gan as a wi@@ re@@ agent of the coup attempt .
against 4@@ 86 people who were allegedly involved in the coup attempt , Ankara has been negotiating in Ankara since that week .
already on the day after the coup , Erdo@@ gan had called the crash test as a &quot; gift of God , &quot; because he gave him the opportunity to &quot; completely clean up the armed forces . &quot;
but does Erdo@@ gan really get a grip on the army ?
at the end of February , the newspaper Hür@@ ri@@ yet published an article entitled &quot; Dis@@ comfort in Military Head@@ quarters . &quot;
in the General Staff , there are concerns about an increasing &quot; Islam@@ ization &quot; of the army , which , among other things , mani@@ f@@ ests itself in the aboli@@ tion of the prohibition of security for soldiers , wrote the newspaper .
in any case , the army and security forces in the army and the security forces continue .
in mid @-@ July , Erdo@@ gan decre@@ ed another 73@@ 95 civil servants , including 230@@ 3 polic@@ emen and 5@@ 46 soldiers .
it seemed that Erdo@@ gan had t@@ amed the military .
the gener@@ als were earlier than the actual lords of the country .
three times , they put@@ ted their role as guar@@ dians of the secular state order .
after his election victory in 2002 , Erdo@@ gan pushed back the power of the military step by step , not least on appeal to the reform requirements of the European Union .
former officers say that Erdo@@ gan is systematically driving an Islam@@ ization of the armed forces .
in the magazine &quot; Vo@@ cal Europe , &quot; a particularly un@@ named officer , who sought asylum after the attempted coup attempt to seek asylum abroad , would be &quot; full of extre@@ mi@@ sts and Sal@@ a@@ fi@@ sts &quot; in a few years .
if this is true , NATO could not leave NATO cold .
anyway , in the alliance after cleansing , there are doubts about the operational readiness of the Turkish army .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the management structures and operational capabilities are &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; weakened , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; say Nato diplom@@ ats . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Washington Chan@@ ges the Green Card Rules
there will be a new US immigration plan to change the rules of the Green Card , said President Donald Tr@@ ump , cited by the media .
he fores@@ ees to reduce the legal immigrants to 50,000 a year , stric@@ ter regulations for obtaining vis@@ as for a temporary work permit and restrictions on family @-@ oriented vis@@ as .
the new rules are proposed by the Republi@@ cans and supported by the President .
the draft bill is to be discussed in the two chambers of the Congress .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this law will reduce poverty , increase wages and save billions of dollars for tax@@ pay@@ ers and will do this by changing the way citizens are issued from other countries &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Green Cards &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the law will prevent the chain migration and replace the current system .
this new application procedure will benefit the candidates who speak English who have the financial means to support themselves and show knowledge that will benefit our economy , &quot; said Tr@@ ump , quoted from the American media .
Ministry wants to rehabil@@ itate track for race shuttle
over and over the past few months have been argu@@ ing about the future of the race shuttle - now it should be quite fast .
before the end of the year , it is planned to build on the ailing route on which the tourist railway runs .
in order to secure the future of the race shuttle in the long term , construction works will begin on the track even this year , according to the Ministry of Transport .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the decision to further order and renov@@ ate the track Il@@ men@@ au @-@ Renn@@ stei@@ g , the country is comm@@ itting itself to this particularly important link , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stated traffic state secretary Klaus Pun@@ l on Friday in Er@@ furt . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he costs about 2.5 million euros for the repair of the route .
the country took 75 percent of this sum .
the agreement , based on which the shuttle is to be ordered by the country in the future , is currently in agreement , declared expi@@ ation .
the Ministry and the South Thur@@ in@@ gia railway as operators are already agreed on the technical details .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this makes the road@@ map , the vehicles used and the quality standards negotiated , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; expi@@ red . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the planned contract between the ministry and the railway company will be closed for a period of eleven years .
this means that the racing platform shuttle will be ordered regularly in December 2017 .
the racing platform shuttle is a popular rail link between the Il@@ men@@ au and Renn@@ stei@@ g railway stations .
in the course of a pilot operation in the past few months , it has been tested whether the route is used by a large number of people to order them regularly in the future .
the track is also in parts strongly di@@ lap@@ id@@ ated .
the rise of sex robots is real , and we should be worried
just as you thought that 2017 can &apos;t be even more crazy , a new report about technological developments in the field of sex robots .
yes , actually .
sex robots are currently one big thing .
recently , the Foundation for Respon@@ sible Robot@@ ics ( FR@@ R ) published a report on the development of sex robots in the next five to ten years .
according to No@@ el Sh@@ ark@@ ey , Professor of Robot@@ ics and Arti@@ ficial Intelligence at the University of She@@ ff@@ iel@@ d and co @-@ founder of the FR@@ R , we must start taking their ascension seriously .
customers can choose the eye color of the robot , its shape of the ni@@ pp@@ le and the type of finger nail .
&quot; people make fun of them , but the companies deliver a lot of it and we will see them much more frequently , &quot; said Mr. Sh@@ ark@@ ey at the publication of his new report .
modern sex d@@ olls have developed from their infl@@ atable partners to robots with a silicone skin that feels warm - with consciously human reactions that are achieved by artificial intelligence .
the user can also &quot; adapt &quot; his robot according to his convic@@ tions and select everything from the eye colour of the robot via the shape of the ni@@ p@@ ples to the type or color of his f@@ ing@@ ern@@ ails .
but it will be more disturbing , as many robots have the &quot; personalities &quot; that would make a step@@ ford woman look progressive .
modern sex d@@ olls have developed into robots with a silicone skin .
the Real@@ B@@ oti@@ x robot , for example , enables its users to adapt their robots to the properties that they find appealing like , for example , sh@@ y@@ ness .
and then there is the Ro@@ xx@@ xy gold sex @-@ robot developed by True Compan@@ ion with pre @-@ programmed personalities such as &quot; Fri@@ gi@@ d Far@@ rah &quot; that gives the impression of sh@@ y@@ ness and &quot; Wild W@@ endy &quot; with an &quot; advent@@ urous &quot; personality .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ro@@ xx@@ xy Gold has a personality which is adapted to your personality as well as possible , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he@@ ats the website of True Compan@@ ion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
so they like what you like , and they don &apos;t like what you don &apos;t like , etc .
she also has her mo@@ ods in the course of the day - just like real people !
she can be tired , fixed on conversation , or she can &quot; be in tune &quot; ! &quot;
there are many disturbing aspects of this rise of sex robots - not least because they replace real human relationships - but the sub@@ mis@@ sive female features , the all@@ u@@ sions to rape , when one goes a step on Fri@@ gi@@ d ( means here : reluc@@ tant ) Far@@ rah , upset one of the most .
on his website , True Compan@@ ion Ro@@ xx@@ xy with a vibr@@ ator but for men .
&quot; if women ( sic ) can have a vibr@@ ator then why can men then have no Ro@@ xx@@ xy ? &quot; is it on the website ?
however , these sex robots are not just a fe@@ tish or just a different sex toy .
their emergence and increasing sophistic@@ ation point to something dark and deeper in our culture , to a retreat from the ideal of gender equality towards a desire for sex with submission as an optional en@@ core .
most men will naturally not hold sex robots , and while the FR@@ R notices their rising popularity , they still remain at the edge of consumer culture .
but what se@@ eps out of the fr@@ ing@@ es can be very instruc@@ tive regarding the spirit of the time we live in .
and many people are not strange or insul@@ ting until the free market for this is given permission .
there is a certain over@@ lap that these highly developed sex robots emerge at a time in which women &apos;s rights are threatened all over the world , in which there is a president in the White House who has bo@@ asted to have attacked women sexually .
the most deter@@ rent aspect of the TV series &apos; The Hand @-@ maid &apos;s T@@ ale &apos; ( &apos; The report of the maid &apos; ) is not the graphic pictures , the intri@@ cate body and the bur@@ sting eyes , but how realistic this vision works .
the Republic of Gilead is a leap , but at the moment this does not feel like a big jump .
the goal behind these sex robots is to produce a physical lik@@ eness to actual women as realistic as technically possible ( al@@ beit with por@@ no@@ star proportions ) .
their builders want them to feel human that they im@@ itate the movement of a real body .
but , when it comes to &quot; personalities , &quot; the robots are not real women .
they cannot separate themselves from their companion or simply go away .
they do not have a mediation or a background story , nothing that points to independence or anything that could interfere with the fantasy of total submission .
in other words , they are fake slaves .
or to express it in the Rede@@ mption of 2017 : maid
Tr@@ um@@ ps great performance ?
he makes Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney the ep@@ it@@ ome of common sense of man
it has become a rush of the Tr@@ ump @-@ era that the political divisions pol@@ arized by the US voters have split even families in small format .
around Christmas and Th@@ ank@@ sgiving there were newspapers in the USA with advice about how to deal with the horror of Tr@@ ump @-@ choosing relatives .
we all claim to burst our filter bags .
less noticed is the power of Tr@@ um@@ ps to bring together families .
I mention this because my cous@@ in , a left @-@ looking poet , who lives in Chicago and has long been working with the re@@ public@@ ans in our family , visited me this week in New York .
she reminded me that unity against a common enemy can have a powerful effect .
with Tr@@ ump in the White House , everyone whom she knows , including the republi@@ can relationship with which she had fought for decades on account of politics , is suddenly and quite strange on the same side .
this is certainly a good thing around the dining table , but it is in a further context that this also brings considerable risks .
the left was strengthened by Tr@@ ump , but the decisive action of his pres@@ idency has the power to push us all to the right .
when we speak of &quot; normal@@ isation &quot; and Tr@@ ump , we refer to the gr@@ ump@@ y possibility that his k@@ itt@@ ens will no longer run away .
however , there is an even more difficult long @-@ term scenario in which Tr@@ ump Republi@@ cans of the right wing are &quot; norm@@ alized , &quot; which suddenly appear as the notion of reason@@ abl@@ eness in comparison with his standards .
I find myself today of an active nostal@@ gia for Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney &apos;s original version of the mad - the dog on the car roof , the 14 % income tax ( but at least we knew how his tax return looked ) - both in fact seem to be a very mild criminal off@@ ence .
when Tr@@ ump goes , the next candidate of the Republi@@ cans must be only spiritually healthy in order to qualify as an im@@ meas@@ urable improvement .
when my cous@@ in was in the city , we brought our children to the car@@ ous@@ el in Central Park , the largest of the car@@ ou@@ sels of the New York park department , and the best three dollars you can spend in the city if you don &apos;t need a caffeine .
the horses are enormously large , the fi@@ ber@@ glass designs on the central cylinder - all c@@ low@@ ns are cre@@ dul@@ ous and the animals turn to look full of fear about their own shoulders - extremely dark and the cli@@ mat@@ ing music im@@ parts this in a strange way .
so many c@@ lich@@ és of a city dis@@ appoint : the views of tall buildings become old , the sky@@ lines become familiar to offer much excitement , and the reality of the city will not do justice to the dream .
thirty @-@ five years later , and I am still not quite over the day when I found that Swiss Cottage is indeed not a Swiss Cottage - the them@@ ed pub Ye Ol@@ de Swiss Cottage does not count - but a large round@@ about in the north of London .
the Central Park car@@ ous@@ el is still a stran@@ gely magical experience as two two @-@ year @-@ olds , a 11 @-@ year @-@ old and two women in the 40 &quot; s can go on it and all have a great time .
if I could have evaluated the car@@ ous@@ el , I would have given him the full score , but luckily no one asked afterwards .
on the other hand , I was forced into a department store this week to evaluate my &quot; experience &quot; with transactions on a scale of one to five stars before I could pass my credit card .
in the coffee house at the corner of my street it is the same , plus the option to balance the rating with a 15 % tip - this to buy something over the counter .
this not only leads to a slow@@ down of what should be a neutral exchange , but also ex@@ erts pressure on the server to bring personality into a situation in which none is required .
the poor woman in the department store was ap@@ ologi@@ zing , while I was tired of the experience to give her my credit card with five stars .
Oscar Pist@@ ori@@ us with chest pain transferred from prison to hospital
for the second time , Pist@@ ori@@ us left the prison for a hospital visit .
last year he was brought to hospital for the treatment of cuts to his wrist , according to the prison authorities , according to a case in his cell .
Pist@@ ori@@ us was sentenced to a first death sentence for murder following an appeal by the prosec@@ ut@@ ors .
he killed Ste@@ enk@@ amp in the early morning hours of Valentine &apos;s Day by firing them several times through a door of the toilet cabin in his house in Pre@@ tori@@ a .
Pist@@ ori@@ us claimed that he kept his girlfriend for a night@@ time intru@@ der , hiding in the cabin .
the prosec@@ ut@@ ors have announced their intention to appeal this time to the six @-@ year prison sentence of Pist@@ ori@@ us App@@ eal , of which they say that it is too indul@@ gent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the national law enforcement agency said that it will appeal to the Supreme Court of South Africa and the appeal could be heard this year . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Pist@@ ori@@ us is at risk that his sentence will be increased to 15 years if the prosec@@ ut@@ ors are successful .
there is no death penalty in South Africa .
when farmer Arnold finds a strange egg
as the last of the Blum@@ berger schools , the four @-@ door @-@ depend@@ ants were dischar@@ ged from caps and bo@@ ilers in the holidays and in the secondary schools .
three of the students will go to secondary school in the future , four to the secondary school .
on Tuesday evening school director An@@ geli@@ ka Sit@@ te welcomed the parents and representatives of the public in the Bürger@@ haus Bi@@ es@@ ental in E@@ pf@@ en@@ ho@@ fen .
the 29 students of the four classes , under the leadership of Sophi@@ a Schumacher and Reg@@ ine Me@@ der , chose a young eagle , who grows up in the poultry farm , but then released to freedom .
the lower band performed a musical with the title &quot; The Eagle in the chicken farm . &quot;
farmer Arnold found a strange egg , and left it from his chi@@ ckens .
instead of a chicken k@@ ens , a small eagle came out .
but the hope of making a chicken out of it sm@@ ashed , the eagle wi@@ ped out its wings on a high mountain and swe@@ pt away .
then the classes showed three and four in the studio of Y@@ von@@ ne Frank a chicken tan@@ ker .
the h@@ ens d@@ anced with the young Go@@ ck@@ eln , the cylinders worn to the bet .
the eagle stands for the integration , said school director An@@ geli@@ ka Sit@@ te .
the kit@@ ten may be different from the other k@@ itt@@ ens ( chi@@ cks ) , but belongs to it .
but he will never be like a chicken .
his determination is to be free .
she wished everyone four @-@ year @-@ old that he feels accepted in his new school .
this was followed by a message of thanks to the colleagues , the former school manager Michael Müller , who always jumps in with teaching bott@@ len@@ ecks , and the parents &quot; representatives .
the time of the cu@@ cum@@ ber was over , said class teacher Sophi@@ a Schumacher .
she only reluc@@ t@@ antly leaves her students very reluc@@ tant after two years , because it had been a really great time .
finally , they can rely on the four @-@ door depend@@ ants .
at the end all students let a song of summer time and holiday season sounded .
in doing so , great joy broke out among the children .
eight first @-@ grade students have already registered for the new school year .
two Bulg@@ arians arrested for illegal camping in Greece
two Bulg@@ arians were arrested for illegal camps in Greece , the Ministry of Foreign Affairs , quoted from television .
in the morning of August 1 , a group of illeg@@ ally ro@@ oting people were arrested in Si@@ th@@ onia , including the two Bulg@@ arians .
they were released on the same day , while an investigation is underway .
the Ministry of Foreign Affairs reported B@@ TV that the Bulg@@ arians were released later .
the Greek authorities have exac@@ erb@@ ated the control of the free camping and put anyone who is found to stay in a place that is not intended for this purpose , substantial fin@@ es .
the controls are continued throughout the season .
the Ministry said that the court can impose a fine .
software update for diesel vehicles : what people need to know now
how exactly does the software update take place ?
do diesel drivers need to participate in the action ?
an overview of the most important questions and answers .
at the diesel summit , BMW , Daimler , Opel and the VW Group have offered software updates for a total of approximately 5.3 million cars .
they aim to improve the emission behaviour of cars in the emissions categories Euro 5 and some Euro 6 .
Euro @-@ 4 diesel or worse are excluded .
An@@ ja S@@ met@@ anin from ACE Auto Club Europe gives assessments :
is the new action mandatory ?
no , the software updates negotiated are voluntary .
&quot; the mandatory updates are only valid for vehicles that have auth@@ ored software , &quot; says An@@ ja S@@ met@@ anin .
the German Federal Office of Technology ( KBA ) has ordered its retro@@ fitting .
how and when will customers be informed about updates ?
the manufacturers have announced rapid implementation over the next few months , but they have not yet known an exact date .
Daimler has informed that Daimler had to write to each person affected .
if an inspection is due in any case , it will be carried out within the framework .
how long will the retro@@ fitting be extended altogether ?
&quot; hard to say , &quot; says S@@ met@@ anin .
this depends on the commitment of the manufacturers as well as from political pressure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because we have seen , the car manufacturers do not act voluntarily on the environment so far . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
how long should the update last ?
the retro@@ fitting could last only three to four hours in the workshop .
time consuming can be to get an appointment .
what do drivers do , who do not drive a car from BMW , Daimler , Opel and the VW group ?
the ACE advises to wait .
presumably foreign manufacturers would prefer S@@ met@@ anin .
is there a massive price fall of Euro @-@ 4 cars ?
the ACE is afraid of that .
but just in the regions where driving prohi@@ bitions thre@@ aten .
so far there is no loss of value for older diesel in the rural area .
the ACE advises to wait with a sale .
ll Cool J Rec@@ ei@@ ves Kennedy Center Award
the Kennedy Awards Gala is one of the most gl@@ amor@@ ous events in Washington .
the first award ceremony under president Tr@@ ump promises to become political .
one of the prize winners doesn &apos;t want to come - from protest .
ll Cool J ( 49 ) is the first ra@@ pper to receive prestigious acc@@ ol@@ ades from the prestigious Kennedy Center .
like the cultural institution announced on Thursday , singer Gl@@ oria Est@@ ef@@ an ( 59 ) , Li@@ onel Rich@@ ie ( 68 ) and the choreograph@@ er Carmen de Lav@@ all@@ ad ( 86 ) and the TV producer Norman Le@@ ar ( 95 ) belong to the scholars .
the awards are given at the beginning of December .
traditionally US President Donald Tr@@ ump will arrange a reception and join with his wife Mel@@ ania at the award ceremony .
the winner of the award , announced with progressive TV series , announced that he would not be allowed to attend the gala .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this pres@@ idency has decided to completely negl@@ ect the arts and human rights - even depri@@ ve them of the means - and that burdens me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the 59 @-@ year @-@ old Est@@ ef@@ an stressed that she will use the talk with Tr@@ ump to clarify her views .
the Kennedy @-@ Center , named after former president John F. Kennedy , is the largest cultural institution in the US capital .
the former prize winners include Mer@@ yl Stre@@ ep , Are@@ tha Fran@@ klin , Robert De Nir@@ o , George Lucas , Tom H@@ anks and St@@ ing .
we make the city worth living
Roland W@@ acker , mayor of Has@@ lach , will reti@@ re next year .
the place is already written - but suitable candidates are rare .
for 31 years W@@ acker has been a city builder .
and the work still makes him great fun , as he conve@@ ys in the press brief@@ ing .
he reports of varied but also demanding tasks waiting for his successor .
at the same time , it is surprised that no application has so far fulfilled the requirement profile .
the city is looking for an architect or civil engineer at the earliest possible time .
this is to be sufficient time for a famili@@ arization with respect to the regular periods of notice .
since Has@@ lach works for the administrative community as a lower building law authority , the applicant must instruc@@ t appropriate degrees .
because this function will definitely keep the city .
if they could no longer fill them , the citizens would have to go to Off@@ enburg .
but clos@@ eness to the citizens is important to the city and to it , says W@@ acker , who reports about a good working climate and a good atmosphere between the authorities and citizens .
in more than 30 years in office , some significant projects have accumulated , looking back on the W@@ acker with pride .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we make the city worth living , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is sure about the building office and its employees . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but also in the future , varied projects are on the agenda : the transformation of the former Hu@@ kl@@ a Are@@ as and the Nieder@@ ho@@ fen parking space have been encountered .
the Kin@@ zig bridge between Boll@@ enbach and Stein@@ ach is renewed , and the stadium renov@@ ations are still subject to change .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the latter will strike with around € 1.5 million , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; If we do it right , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; W@@ acker appreci@@ ates . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all in all , great tasks await my success@@ ors . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the work here is fun . &quot;
design is available for a city building master of great le@@ e@@ way .
with Has@@ lach &apos;s own yard and nur@@ sery , many things can react flexibly to many .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can move a lot , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says W@@ acker , and the design of the green spaces is often praised by citizens and visitors . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
as the old part of the old@@ town stands under monument protection , it is important to &quot; have an eye on what fits in &quot; if new buildings are approved , the out@@ going city builder emphasizes .
anyway , the city building master takes a great deal of responsibility .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is a builder , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the end everything runs here above my table . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
with care and coordination he can count on many years of experience : Markus Neu@@ ma@@ ier ( Hoch@@ bau ) has been there for ten years , Manfred Schön@@ er ( civil engineering ) has been working for 15 years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; W@@ acker wants his successor to stay for a long time : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are looking for someone who really wants to be identified and remain with the place . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
continuity is not only important for a good working atmosphere , but also for the further design of the city .
according to information provided by the city of Has@@ lach , if you want to bury Roland W@@ acker , you should have a completed study as a graduate engineer or a Bachelor with a speci@@ alization in architecture and have good professional knowledge in the fields of planning and construction planning law .
the Stadt@@ bau@@ amt are subject to civil engineering and civil engineering , building instruction , bur@@ ial matters , administration of urban properties , urban estate with building yard and urban gardening as well as the Lower Civil Rights Authority , including monument protection .
bicycle thrown on lines : South track closed
according to the police , the previously unknown perpet@@ rators had thrown the blue bicycle from the railway track transfer in the area of the Le@@ oben Street ( B@@ 116 ) to the lines .
these were damaged so severely that the approaching freight train had to be stopped .
the investig@@ ators go out from two male perpet@@ rators and have been looking for them since the night .
a ros@@ y sco@@ oter and a bicycle driver were seen near the scene .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that goes far beyond a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Laus@@ bu@@ ben &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Ö@@ BB speaker Christoph Pos@@ ch to the AP@@ A . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the perpet@@ r@@ ator would have brought himself into great danger and je@@ op@@ ardi@@ zed train traffic .
in addition to the damage to the locom@@ oti@@ ves and the plant , as well as the delay of delay and the costs of rail freight transport , P@@ ön@@ alen of the railway customers could also come to the perpet@@ rators .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in total , a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; substantial &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sum can be assumed , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the speaker . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the damage was repaired on Friday afternoon , the rail traffic on the southern run@@ way could be led without any disabilities .
nearly ten passenger trains were dropped on Friday morning , two of them entered the correspondence .
freight trains did not fall out , but they had a delay .
according to Ö@@ BB speaker Christoph Pos@@ ch some 200 metres of overhead lines had to be replaced .
insul@@ ators and ma@@ sts were also damaged .
red meat , dairy products and chocolate might help allevi@@ ate IB@@ D ( inflammatory bow@@ el disease )
red meat and chocolate may sound like a night@@ mare for your digestive system .
but a new study claims exactly the opposite : a diet rich in meat @-@ based proteins and dairy products could allevi@@ ate the symptoms of patients with inflammatory bow@@ el disease .
the incur@@ able condition , which affects approximately 1.3 million in the United States and 300@@ ,000 in the United States , causes stomach cra@@ mps and flat@@ ul@@ ence , recur@@ rent or bloody diar@@ rho@@ ea , weight loss , and extreme fatigue .
while those affected are usually advised to avoid meat and dairy products to allevi@@ ate their symptoms , researchers found at the Washington University that the essential amino acid tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han contributes to proteins to develop immune cells that promote a toler@@ ant intestine .
the senior researcher , Dr. Marco Col@@ onna , stated that immune cells pat@@ rol in the gut to ensure that harmful micro@@ bes hiding in the food do not penetrate the body .
cells capable of tri@@ g@@ gering inflammation are compensated by cells that promote tolerance and protect the body without damaging sensitive tissues .
if the equilibrium tends to be too far in the direction of inflammation , it can result in inflammatory bow@@ el disease .
in experiments it was found that a type of tolerance @-@ promoting immune cell is found in mice carrying a specific bacter@@ ium in their intest@@ ines .
and the bacter@@ ium needs tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han - one of the building blocks of proteins - to trigger the appearance of the cells .
Professor Col@@ onna said : &quot; we have a connection between a species of bacteria - Lac@@ to@@ bac@@ ill@@ us reu@@ ter@@ i - which is a normal part of the gut micro@@ bi@@ ome , and the development of a population of cells that promote tolerance .
the more tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han the mice had in their food , the more they had from these immune cells . &quot;
he suggested that the combination of L. reu@@ ter@@ i and a diet toler@@ ant of tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han contributes to toler@@ ant , less inflammatory bow@@ el mi@@ lie@@ us if the same system works also in humans .
the post @-@ doctoral candidate Dr. Lu@@ isa Cer@@ v@@ antes @-@ Bar@@ ra@@ gan examined a type of immune cell that promotes tolerance when she found out that a group of study mice had such cells , but another group of the same family , who had been accommod@@ ated separately , did not have this .
she suspected that the difference with the intestinal micro@@ bial cells of mice had to do - the community of bacteria , viruses and fung@@ i , which normally live in the gastro@@ intestinal tract .
the intest@@ ines of mice were sequ@@ enced and six bacterial species found that were present in mice with the immune cells , but were missing in mice .
mice were raised in a sterile environment , so that an intestinal micro@@ bi@@ ome was missing and they did not develop this type of immune cells and they received the L. reu@@ ter@@ i and the immune cells .
in order to understand how the bacteria worked on the immune system , the researchers L. reu@@ ter@@ i spread in a liquid and then transferred small amounts of the liquid - without the bacteria - on im@@ mature immune cells isolated from the mice .
the immune cells developed into the toler@@ ant cells .
when the active component was puri@@ fied from the liquid , it turned out to be a by@@ product of tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han metabolism , known as an i@@ dol @-@ 3 lac@@ tic acid .
when the researchers doubled the amount of tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han in mice &apos;s feed , the number of cells increased by about 50 percent , but when tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han was hal@@ ved , the number of cells decreased by half .
Dr. Cer@@ v@@ antes @-@ Bar@@ ra@@ gan declared that people have the same toler@@ ant cells as mice , and that most of us protect L. reu@@ ter@@ i in our gastro@@ intestinal trac@@ ts .
it is not known whether tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han auxiliary products from L. reu@@ ter@@ i develop the cells in humans as in mice , but defects in genes related to tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han have been found in people with inflammatory bow@@ el disease .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the development of these cells is probably something we want to promote , as these cells control inflammation on the inner surface of the intest@@ ines . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
potentially high tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han values can lead to an extension of this population in the presence of L. reu@@ ter@@ i . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Jose M@@ our@@ in@@ ho believes Manchester United is committed to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; genius &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with N@@ eman@@ ja M@@ atic &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at Manchester United , N@@ eman@@ ja M@@ atic signed a &quot; genius &quot; and believes Jose M@@ our@@ in@@ ho , after the mid@@ fiel@@ der had his debut at S@@ amp@@ d@@ oria on Wednesday evening .
the 40 million pounds of signing of Chelsea started with a 2 : 1 win in Dublin , the last season game before the UEF@@ A Super Cup ki@@ cked off on Tuesday , and impressed in the bracket role as people like Paul Pog@@ gio and Andreas Per@@ eira are advancing at will .
matic , however , was excluded from the pro@@ visi@@ oning Asia tour of the blues and managed only 45 minutes , which M@@ our@@ in@@ ho admitted that he had to improve before the beginning of the Premier League season .
&quot; he needs time , but his experience , intelligence , genius in the way he thinks - he thinks of football , &quot; said M@@ our@@ in@@ ho .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will help him to be ready earlier than later . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition to M@@ atic , Victor Lin@@ del@@ of and Rom@@ el@@ u Lu@@ k@@ ak@@ u went to the Avi@@ va stadium , as M@@ our@@ in@@ ho formed his start @-@ XI for the start of the season .
the Independent revealed this week that M@@ our@@ in@@ ho had three more new commitments , but he insist@@ ed that the club has already done a &quot; fantastic job &quot; to fulfil three of its four priority new commitments .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to get three of four , I thank the association , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he added . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I will be happ@@ ier if they get four out of four for me , but they have taken great effort . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Boeing &apos;s Pain@@ ting &quot; Dream@@ liner in the Sky
the aircraft manufacturer Boeing has drawn the sil@@ houette of a Dream@@ liner into the sky .
the pilots flew from Seattle in Washington State Washington , but the drawing began in Marqu@@ ette in U.S. state Mich@@ igan and with@@ drew in the form of a Dream@@ liner over the USA , which are several thousand kilometers .
the action lasted 18 hours and a minute .
the form of a Dream@@ liner was to be on the radar screens .
the whole was a endurance test for new engines .
Boeing had already made such advertising earlier .
the number &quot; 7@@ 87 &quot; and the Boeing logo were painted in the sky .
new draft for Martin Schulz - Hanover , we have a problem
as the wind turns , when Sig@@ mar Gabriel was still the SPD leader , Social @-@ Democratic ministers looked always with a certain concern for Berlin before elections .
only no fires from the centr@@ ality of the party , but no head@@ winds from the Con@@ federation , was the most important wish of the warri@@ ors .
since Martin Schulz leads the party , this has changed fundamentally .
since then , the employees from the Willy @-@ Brandt @-@ Haus are observing the events in the SPD @-@ governed state capitals .
what Schulz has received from there since the beginning of the year would not be described in the approach with head@@ winds .
there were grav@@ stro@@ kes .
and one by one .
the federal CD@@ U looks after the surprising end of the red @-@ green majority in Lower Saxony a general signal against coalition of SPD and Gre@@ ens .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; once again , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; red @-@ green can simply not be credi@@ ble , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said CD@@ U Secretary General Peter Tau@@ ber the editorial network Germany ( R@@ ND ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the surprising faction of the S &amp; D Group led the government of Prime Minister Stephan Wei@@ l ( SPD ) into a serious crisis .
five months before the Parliament elections , its red @-@ green coalition lost its one @-@ votes majority to the opposition from CD@@ U and F@@ DP .
the Green Party CEO Michael Kell@@ ner has called upon the rebel@@ li@@ ous Lower @-@ Sax@@ on Green Party member El@@ ke T@@ life@@ jackets to give back their mandate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the transition to the CD@@ U means a clear distortion of the elec@@ torate . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
El@@ ke T@@ life@@ jackets must immediately return her mandate , &quot; said the Federal President and election head of the Green Party to the German editorial network ( R@@ ND ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this must not be true , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; an SPD election campaig@@ ner si@@ ghs when the new job message reaches the party headquarters on Friday morning . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Stephan Wei@@ l , SPD Prime Minister of Lower Saxony , stands for the CD@@ U after the transition of the green de@@ pu@@ ties El@@ ke T@@ life@@ jackets to the CD@@ U without their own government majority .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is the preliminary highlight of a whole series of large and small crises in SPD regional associations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and no one knows what happens next .
the misery began with the un@@ expect@@ edly clear defeat at the Saarland @-@ election in March .
a blue eye , more not , was the companions of the time .
after the legislative elections in Schleswig @-@ Holstein and North Rhine @-@ Westphalia , everything will be different .
it became even worse - and it got much worse .
the defeat in Kiel brought the SPD into w@@ ander , the Düsseldorf bank@@ rupt@@ cy mu@@ stered the party smoothly .
the comrades assembled with difficulty in the weeks afterwards .
then , when they had just exhausted new courage , the G @-@ 20 summit was coming from Hamburg .
and with him came the next draft .
mayor O@@ la@@ f Sch@@ olz , the last strong SPD leader , lost its Nim@@ bus this weekend because it was sitting in the El@@ b@@ phil@@ harmon@@ ie while his city was burning .
and because in crisis communication he made quite a mistake about what you can do wrong .
since then , Sch@@ olz has been fighting for its political survival .
so now also Stephan Wei@@ l .
because of the VW exhaust @-@ gas atmosphere and its role in the Supervisory Board , the Prime Minister of Lower Saxony has already been in criticism for some time now .
mi@@ ese poll@@ s were added .
nevertheless , or perhaps because of this , Wei@@ l tried to set accents in the Con@@ federation in recent weeks .
the aim of the former mayor of Hanover to extend his power in Berlin was also not hidden in the surroundings of Martin Schulz .
they allowed him to grant him a stabili@@ zation of the party by Wei@@ l .
now the exact opposite could occur .
in this context , Wei@@ l is not guilty of the party @-@ internal compul@@ sion of the Lower Saxony @-@ based Gre@@ ens .
and Schulz doesn &apos;t know at all .
at times , the comrades try to keep their own ranks closed .
their anger is directed to the Gre@@ ens , and especially to the apost@@ ate Par@@ liam@@ ent@@ arian T@@ ris@@ tians .
&quot; it is int@@ ol@@ erable and democr@@ ati@@ fying how Mr@@ s T@@ life@@ jackets puts their own car@@ eers over the interests of all others , &quot; says Matthias Mi@@ er@@ sch , head of the party left in the SPD Par@@ liam@@ entary Group , the German editorial network ( R@@ ND ) .
Mrs. T@@ life@@ jacket was not elected as a direct candidate because of her personality , but on the country list of the Lower Saxony @-@ based Gre@@ ens in parliament , so the Lower Saxony de@@ pu@@ ties continued .
the logical consequence would be that she returns her mandate .
Thomas Op@@ per@@ mann , head of the SPD Par@@ liam@@ entary Group , compl@@ ains an &quot; un@@ democratic manoeu@@ vre . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the voters &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; voters &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; four years ago was clear : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; people have made Stephan Wei@@ l the Prime Minister , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Op@@ per@@ mann , who leads the SPD as a leading candidate in the Bundestag election , the R@@ ND . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now the personal career of a future CD@@ U de@@ pu@@ ties counter@@ fei@@ ts the election result , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Op@@ per@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he called for clari@@ fication of the background .

those who want to be able to renov@@ ate their home in the years can soon get support from the country .
in addition , mayor Albert Sch@@ in@@ dler and three representative St@@ eg city development on Wednesday in sens@@ ations .
at the beginning of the information session Sch@@ in@@ dler once again gave a review of what happened .
since 1991 , it has been working in sensi@@ cal rehabilitation areas .
at that time , in the refur@@ bish@@ ment area I from 1991 to 2004 , the State of Baden @-@ Württemberg took over two thirds of the subsi@@ dy sum .
in the refur@@ bish@@ ment area II from 2005 to 2016 , the subsi@@ dy was still 60 percent .
for Sch@@ in@@ dler the refur@@ bish@@ ments to date are a &quot; success project &quot; - it is finally important to promote internal development and not only open up new areas of construction .
on 4 April , the government pres@@ i@@ dium Karlsruhe received the information that there will be a rehabilitation area III .
the funding amount amounts to 8@@ 33 3@@ 33 Euro , of which 500 000 Euros are from the country , the rest of the community felt .
how does a renovation work develop ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to explore , so Sch@@ in@@ dler , where the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; really old &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; houses are . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but it also plays a role as to whether or not in the planned area any interest exists .
if necessary , the area borders could then be postpon@@ ed again .
on Wednesday evening , the bridge represented Martin Keller , Gab@@ y Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann and Sarah Got@@ zel .
Keller presented the contents of the Federal Government Programme &quot; Social City , &quot; in which the renov@@ ations would then be carried out .
the core of the program is the rev@@ ital@@ isation of inner cities , improving living and working relationships and maintaining and expanding infrastructure .
the measures would take place object @-@ related , that is , per property .
the rehabilitation area would then finally be defined as a statute .
the grant period for the funding has been running since January 1 , 2017 until April 30 , 20@@ 26 .
until September this year , however , the inventory assessment would be carried out only once , within the framework of those involved in the rehabilitation area to fill out a questionnaire for filling out .
in November or December , as far as possible , the pro@@ posi@@ tional decision is to take place , so that in the coming year the re@@ struc@@ tur@@ ings can be started .
afterwards , Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann explained that each commun@@ e must carry out the aforementioned precau@@ tions .
it is about evaluating the urban development of the city and deciding when it will be rehabil@@ itated and to what extent .
there will also be a re@@ mark in the land register for the respective plot .
Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann will come again to emotion and get a picture of the situation , she promised .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Got@@ zel stressed , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; an essential success factor for the project is the participation of those involved . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is why there will be questionn@@ aires that will be sent to the citizens in the coming weeks and completed by the end of the summer holidays .
the yellow questionnaire is the &quot; building and property sheet , &quot; in which it concerns the structural condition and the renovation .
in the grey questionnaire , the &quot; H@@ ous@@ ehold and H@@ ousing sheet , &quot; information on size , distribution and residents of a residential space can be made .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the blue &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; business sheet &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; can only be filled if business premises are operated in the building . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , Got@@ zel pointed out that a completed questionnaire is not at the same time an application for funding .
in addition , new construction measures are not eligible .
Sch@@ in@@ dler also stressed that the distribution of the subsidies after the &quot; gre@@ y@@ ho@@ und principle &quot; is working - who comes first , ground first .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can &apos;t reserve funds for later . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
finally , photos from the project &quot; City Department II &quot; were presented to make the present a &quot; tasty &quot; refur@@ bish@@ ment .
British invent@@ or sets himself a micro@@ chip to come in house and car with a hand movement
a British invent@@ or is the first in the country equipped with a micro@@ chip to open his front door , enter his office and even start his car with a hand movement .
Steven Nor@@ th@@ am , 33 , had im@@ planted the tiny chip between thumb and index finger and now offers the service for companies and individuals who want to simplify their life with technology through his company Bio@@ Te@@ q .
he joined Dr. Ge@@ off Wat@@ son , a consult@@ ative aes@@ th@@ esi@@ ologist at the Royal H@@ amp@@ shire County Hospital in Win@@ chester , H@@ ants , to ensure that the implant procedure is carried out according to medical standards .
the technology resembles a cat and dogs im@@ planted micro@@ chip and takes only 30 seconds .
Mr. Nor@@ th@@ am also wants to change the locks on houses and cars in such a way that they are compatible with the chip , all for a surcharge of £ 300 per lock .
the married father of one has now installed both at home and with his BMW Z@@ 4 technology , which starts when his hand is at the wheel .
the advertising costs of the White House cost the tax@@ pay@@ er thousands
the White House &apos;s decision to fly a nav@@ y helicopter to the South La@@ wn for an event that under@@ mines American manufacturing last month will cost tax@@ pay@@ ers according to the military supplies that were left to the TI@@ ME magazine up to 24@@ ,000 US dollars .
the green @-@ white Si@@ kor@@ sky V@@ H @-@ 3D , known as Marine One , when the President is on board , was the heart of the event on July 17 in the White House with American construction programs .
President Donald Tr@@ ump , vice @-@ president Mike P@@ ence and senior officials of the White House made a tour of products from all 50 states .
the helicopter , manufactured in Connec@@ tic@@ ut , was displayed next to a Ma@@ ine Yacht , a Wisconsin fire bri@@ g@@ ade and a forklift truck from Miss@@ issi@@ ppi .
the White House military office demanded the presence of the helicopter in a frag@@ mentary order or Fra@@ go , hardly 36 hours before the helicopter on the South La@@ wn landed , according to the records of the Navy Hel@@ icop@@ ter Squ@@ ad@@ ron One ( H@@ MX @-@ 1 ) , the unit responsible for the operation of the helicopter .
&quot; I just wanted you to be aware of it because it is such an unusual event with high visibility , &quot; wrote the commander of the H@@ MX @-@ 1 on the eve of the event to his superior , the deputy commander for aviation .
the message showed that the helicopter arrived on the South La@@ wn on July 17th at 7@@ am for the event at 15 o &apos;clock , and so long remained until the lawn was cleared between 18 : 00 and 21 : 00 on that evening .
the note adds that if the departure from the White House should be delayed due to the limitation of the service hours a second crew would be required for the return flight .
the original flight crew was during the event at the helicopter while the security personnel of the unit stayed on the ground during the time on the plane .
from the records provided by the TI@@ ME , it was not clear whether a second flight crew was required .
the H@@ atch Act forbi@@ ds federal employees to use state property for political purposes .
records show that H@@ MX @-@ 1 asked if the event could viol@@ ate the appointment .
&quot; a question we asked was whether it was a violation of the H@@ atch Acts and we were informed that this was not the case , &quot; wrote the command@@ ant .
&quot; sounds like you &apos;re locked up , &quot; the assistant Command@@ ant answered .
the event &quot; Made in America &quot; was designated as an official event by the White House and would not have been covered by the H@@ atch Act .
but also official events have political over@@ tones .
at the event , the president gave a push for reform of the health reform that was going on in the Senate and he advoc@@ ated efforts to cur@@ b government regulations .
the use of the aircraft known as Marine One or Air Force One is hardly a new phenomenon .
pres@@ idents are obliged to use them for the trip .
but to request their use only for a photo OR is unusual .
Tr@@ ump carried out an investigation in February when the presidential jet was in front of his first campaign rally in Melbourne , Florida , taxi services , and his Twitter account is full of reports compl@@ aining about the use of the presidential aer@@ op@@ lane by its predecessor .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the White House is enthusiastic about the show &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Made In America &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; shows products from all 50 countries produced by American workers with American materials , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Deputy President of the White House , Lind@@ say Wal@@ ters . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
H@@ MX @-@ 1 occup@@ ations often carry out training flights in the Washington and South La@@ wn area to susp@@ end U.S. President in the White House with precise centimet@@ res .
when Tr@@ ump was at the G@@ 20 summit in Germany at the beginning of July , H@@ MX @-@ 1 in the White House led 58 exercise land@@ ings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the flight for the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Made in America &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; event counted during the training requirement of the flight crew for the month , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a civil servant . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; helicop@@ ters also flew 11 hours on that day for &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; non @-@ presidential support missions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the White House said that tax@@ pay@@ ers over@@ took the burden of none of the other pro@@ ps presented at the event .
a spokes@@ man of Si@@ kor@@ sky said that the company had not been involved in exhibiting the helicopter on the South La@@ wn .
H@@ MX @-@ 1 does not run budget desig@@ nations for the presidential flights , and it is difficult to determine the exact cost of the event .
according to the U.S. Department of Defense &apos;s emergency tari@@ ffs for the fiscal year 2017 , the Do@@ D reimbur@@ sement rate for the V@@ H @-@ 3D is 24.@@ 380 USD per hour .
records of the unit recorded the flight time of the aircraft as 30 minutes from the home base of the Marine Corps Air Fac@@ ility in Qu@@ an@@ tico in Virginia .
the White House ar@@ gues that the actual cost of operating the helicopter exceeds that rate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the cost of tax@@ pay@@ ers based on estimates for reimbur@@ sement rates is highly mis@@ leading , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wal@@ ters said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these estimates include personnel , maintenance and many other hidden costs that are included in annual funding . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to a RA@@ ND study from 2015 , the reimbur@@ sement rates for Do@@ D do not include personnel costs , but take into account the costs of fuel , maintenance and conclusion of the contract .
at that time , the former spokes@@ man of the White House , Se@@ an Sp@@ ic@@ er , defended the use of the helicopter for the event .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the idea is to present things this week that are made in America , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Sp@@ ic@@ er . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and I know that Si@@ kor@@ sky and the state of Connec@@ tic@@ ut are very proud to contribute to our national security , and I assume that hundreds if not thousands of people depend on it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and I think like most Americans we are all proud of the helicopter and other military equipment , for which so many Americans worked ti@@ rel@@ essly .
of course , it is appropriate to highlight that . &quot;
it was not clear whether Tr@@ ump inter@@ acted with the helicopter when he entered his tour of the South La@@ wn for the event , but he sat in the driver &apos;s seat of a fire fighting car .
in the White House Tr@@ ump spoke to representatives of Si@@ kor@@ sky and j@@ oked with the media about his own fleet of corporate products .
&quot; I know Si@@ kor@@ sky very well , &quot; the president said , &quot; I have three of them . &quot;
TC BW Ne@@ uss ahead of tri@@ cky task
leader of the Second Tennis Bundes@@ lig@@ a joins the third Su@@ chs@@ dorf S@@ V .
the TC Blau @-@ Weiss ninth takes place tomorrow from 11@@ am in Kiel in the third Su@@ chs@@ dorf S@@ V .
despite the five games being still flaw@@ less , the leader of the Second Tennis Bundes@@ lig@@ a has gained the sense of reality .
team Princip@@ al Mari@@ us Z@@ ay has respect for the opponent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a compact team that always plays in quite similar formation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; especially on the back positions I find the team very good . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for class and stability at the S@@ V Su@@ chs@@ dorf , imports mainly cause imports from the high North .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; their Dan@@ es and Finn@@ s can even point to assignments in the Davis Cup . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and they are also strong in dou@@ bles , &quot; says Z@@ ay with a view to Har@@ ri Heli@@ ov@@ a@@ ara ( Finland ) , Andr@@ e Gö@@ ran@@ sson ( Sweden ) , S@@ ören and Es@@ ben O@@ lesen , Martin Pe@@ der@@ sen and Andreas B@@ jer@@ reh@@ us ( all Denmark ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it will be hard for us as always . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you need a good portion of luck . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Ne@@ us@@ ser team for the trip to the high north is practical .
his debut for blue wh@@ ites could give Maxim@@ e Jan@@ vier .
if the Fren@@ ch@@ man active in the Chall@@ enger tournament in the Italian Bi@@ ella is not part of the Bundes@@ lig@@ a @-@ No. , the Z@@ den@@ ek Kol@@ ar ( Czech Republic ) playing at the tournament in the Czech Liber@@ ec season is one of his first bet@@ s in this season .
the previously un@@ defeated Chil@@ ean Hans Pod@@ lip@@ nik @-@ Cas@@ tillo was yesterday at the AT@@ P tournament in K@@ itz@@ büh@@ el at the AT@@ P tournament in K@@ itz@@ büh@@ el .
he should be in Kiel as well as Bot@@ ic Van de Z@@ and@@ schul@@ p , N@@ iel@@ s Lo@@ ot@@ sm@@ a ( both Netherlands ) and the Belgian Juli@@ en C@@ agn@@ ina .
after his two victories last Sunday against the Club at the Al@@ ster , Má@@ té Val@@ gar@@ z could once again put back into the team .
enough for the 18 @-@ year @-@ old Hungary , who was still the number one of the Junior World Ran@@ king in January 2016 , does not fill the cad@@ re from the coach line around Mari@@ us Z@@ ay .
how America can harm O@@ MV
Donald Tr@@ ump was really happy when he signed his signature on Wednesday evening under the law to tigh@@ ten sanctions against Russia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in his attempt to en@@ act the law , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Congress &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; packed in un@@ constitutional provisions , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the reaction from Moscow was as sharp as expected , and even Brussels was fo@@ aming against the US advance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after all , the draft plans to punish European companies that help the Russians to build gas pi@@ pelines in the EU . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
since then , investors from local O@@ MV , who together with other European companies have co @-@ financed the construction of the Russian Eastern Soul North Stream 2 .
the threatening scenery is enormous .
nevertheless , it is too early for an estimate of the consequences , such as the official statement of the oil company .
in fact , Donald Tr@@ ump himself would have to impose sanctions on an executive order .
twelve weapons are available to him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the press &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has looked at what the Group could rep@@ el and which could really hurt him . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Nar@@ co Season 3 Tra@@ iler : without Pablo Es@@ co@@ bar , the Cal@@ i Cart@@ el is put into the centre of the hit series by Net@@ fli@@ x
despite the second season of Nar@@ co , who reveals Pablo Es@@ co@@ bars Killer , the series of Net@@ fli@@ x is far from over .
the e@@ as@@ els three and four were already confirmed by the streaming service , the first received its first trailer and showed the latest bad@@ dies of the show .
with the third season DE@@ A has focused its attention on the rich@@ est organization of drug traffi@@ cking in the world : the Cal@@ i @-@ cart@@ el .
led by four powerful god@@ parents , they operate like a Fort@@ une 500 company , &quot; only with more government bri@@ ber@@ y and violent actions .
Gil@@ berto Rodri@@ gu@@ ez O@@ re@@ ju@@ ela ( Dam@@ ian Al@@ c@@ azar ) is the leader of the Kart@@ ells , Miguel Rodri@@ gu@@ ez O@@ re@@ ju@@ ela ( Francisco Denis ) is her head , P@@ ach@@ o Herr@@ era ( Alberto Am@@ mann ) commands the Mexican connection , and Ch@@ ep@@ e Sant@@ ac@@ ru@@ z London@@ o ( Pep@@ e Rap@@ az@@ ote ) is located in New York .
in the newly released trailer Pedro Pascal returns as J@@ avier Pe@@ ña , the guy who invites American and Colom@@ bian law enforcement authorities to support the war on drugs .
other new actors include M@@ ati@@ as Var@@ ela , Michael Stahl @-@ David , Matt W@@ hel@@ an , Miguel Angel Silv@@ est@@ re , Kerry bis@@ he and Ar@@ tur@@ o Castro .
the third season of Nar@@ co will start on September 1st .
roll back : the city provides 46 kitchen utensils
the city organizes the K@@ ita lunch table again .
with firm contact persons for the children and an assignment to the team .
in the municipal day@@ care centers the clock is turned back .
as of September 1 , the city of Kre@@ feld will take over the food supply in the municipal kinder@@ garten facilities ( Kit@@ as ) .
for Son@@ ja Pom@@ mer@@ anz , deputy head of the youth welfare department , this is a good news : &quot; we were all very pleased . &quot;
it continues to cook outside the house : a cat@@ erer takes over this task and supplies freshly cooked chill@@ ed .
the city runs 46 day@@ care centers in the Kre@@ feld area , in 44 children get a hot meal at lunch@@ time .
in the last year of Kit@@ a@@ year 28@@ 00 children sat at the tables , and the demand is growing steadily .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; meanwhile , not only children who are taken care of 45 week@@ lies in the mid@@ day K@@ ita , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains Pom@@ er@@ anz . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the offer is also valid in 35 @-@ hour care if children stay until 14 o &apos;clock &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
46 Parti@@ al @-@ time staff have kitchen service as of September 1 : they heat up the dishes delivered , add salad , raw food and fruit , divide the meal individually , give the food clean , clear away , rinse and clean the kitchen .
&quot; the employees are assigned to a K@@ ita , &quot; says Pom@@ mer@@ anz .
the size - there are two @-@ group as well as sev@@ ent@@ een units - decide on the ho@@ ur@@ ly circum@@ ference .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the kitchen hel@@ pers are now part of the K@@ ita team , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Pom@@ er@@ anz . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so they are much more involved and it is easier for hospital management to implement pedago@@ gical concepts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
because it is also a matter of eating healthy eating and cooking lessons .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the children should help prepare food . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the direct connection of the kitchen power to the team is reasonable .
also for the children .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they have a well @-@ known power in the K@@ ita , a person familiar with them , and not constantly changing people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this continuity is important for children .
the cleaning of the kitchen facilities - until now also the job of the kitchen staff - will be done by special cleaning staff in the future .
this variation - the separation of cleaning and kitchen service - besides the quality improvement of the kitchen service also has the charm that it has shown in the cost comparison between self @-@ control and foreign allocation for the city as the most economical one , it says from the Press Office .
and this , although 46 part @-@ time forces are re@@ configured .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but these hours are not so much in weight for some 750 people , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Son@@ ja Pom@@ mer@@ anz . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Afgh@@ an democracy depends on the political role of women , says the UN
elections can only be representative if all members of society , including women , play a role , said the leader of the UN mission in Afghanistan on Wednesday .
Nicholas Hay@@ som , acting head of the United Nations mission , said that hundreds of women are candidates in the provinces . three women are candidates for the role of vice @-@ president and more than 30 percent of newly registered voters are women .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the role of women cannot be over@@ estimated , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said on Wednesday in a statement . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
elections can only be truly representative and credi@@ ble when women participate fully in all parts of the election process .
the provincial council and the presidential elections take place on 5 April .
the Tali@@ ban has published threats against a choice process that coinci@@ des with the transition from international fighting actions to an advisory role .
this year , elections for the first time will be handed over to power peac@@ efully by a democr@@ atically elected government .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hay@@ som said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a strong role for women will reinforce the democratic success of Afghanistan . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Afgh@@ an independent electoral commission reported that 1.2 million women from a total of 3,@@ 6 million registered voters were registered .

men try to ro@@ b 13 @-@ year @-@ old girl
two young men aged 19 and 23 should have tried to ro@@ b a 13 @-@ year old girl on Thursday .
according to the police , the men spoke to the 13 @-@ year @-@ old who stayed with friends at Kol@@ p@@ ing@@ straße at 14.@@ 55 , because they wanted to phone the girl &apos;s mobile phone .

the investigations run .
G@@ MB concern about investments in the Mc@@ Vi@@ tie factory in Glasgow
a union would like to as@@ certain its long @-@ term commitment to production at its Glasgow plant in the managers of the Bis@@ ku@@ it manufacturer Mc@@ Vi@@ tie .
G@@ MB Scotland said that the company was weighing over the future of investments at the T@@ oll@@ cross site .
more than 500 employees work in the plant , which produces hob@@ no@@ bs and rich tea bis@@ cuits in addition to other products .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mc@@ Vi@@ ties owner Pla@@ dis said he has invested more than 5 million pounds in recent years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he added that workers and union representatives &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; would first learn &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if their activities would change . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in a letter to the company &apos;s branch leader , G@@ MB Scotland Mc@@ Vi@@ tie &apos;s insist@@ ed on &quot; expressing concerns that funding for the modernization of production lines will not be pushed forward . &quot;
G@@ MB @-@ Senior @-@ organizer Dre@@ w Du@@ ffy said : &quot; the fact that we cannot gain clarity about the business needs and investment plans for the future of T@@ oll@@ cross from the General @-@ Site Manager is deeply affected by our members .
generations of families have worked here and the workers strongly focus on the local community and the Greater Glasgow , an important pillar for decent jobs in an area of high unemployment and social disadvantage .
therefore , under the perspective of jobs , wages and prosperity , and against the background of the Bre@@ x@@ it , the rising cost of living and the chronic decline of production , Glasgow &apos;s eastern end urgently needs a flour@@ ishing production presence at Mc@@ Vi@@ tie . &quot;
a spokes@@ woman from Pla@@ dis said : &quot; the manager at T@@ oll@@ cross received a letter from G@@ MB Scotland last night , and the company will react directly to it as we value the continuous commitment to employees and trade union representatives .
two months ago , we had regular meetings with employees and G@@ MB representatives at T@@ oll@@ cross where some questions were openly discussed .
we discussed with the employees that , like all companies engaged in an extremely competitive and uncertain economic climate , we constantly review our business - and this applies to all our business units and locations - to remain competitive .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in recent years we have invested more than 5 million pounds in our T@@ oll@@ cross site , particularly in production lines and operational improvements . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we recognise the legacy of T@@ oll@@ cross as a production site fully and completely . if our operations change at the location , employees and their union representatives will be the first to learn this . &quot;
did PS@@ G Barcelona warn of N@@ ey@@ mar three years ago ?
La League &apos;s side may regret its interest in Marco Ver@@ r@@ atti
Paris Saint @-@ Ger@@ main will refra@@ in from pursuing N@@ ey@@ mar &apos;s persecution after having submitted an offer of £ 18@@ 9 million to trigger its release clause , but have they warned Barcelona three years ago before the world record ?
the sens@@ ational approach has heated the transfer window in summer , because the Lig@@ ue 1 club is ready to break the world record by more than double the previous mark , with Paul Pog@@ ba returning to Manchester United for 89 million pounds in the past season .
after completion , N@@ ey@@ mar becomes the most expensive player in the world and to the highest @-@ paid professional ath@@ lete in the world . PS@@ G offers wages of over 500@@ ,000 GBP per week .
Barcelona is fur@@ ious about the way N@@ ey@@ mar has forced his way to the outside , although there is a source near the Catal@@ ans &quot; Board that the club has always given its best to take care of it since its arrival in San@@ tos in 2013 .
but was the football world warned of the PS@@ G president three years ago ?
when Manchester City in 2014 expressed interest in the signing of Bla@@ ise Mat@@ u@@ id@@ i , N@@ asser Al @-@ K@@ hel@@ ai@@ fi had a strict warning for any club that wanted to sign one of PS@@ G &apos;s best players .
&quot; I &apos;m not worried because they know that when they touch one of our players , then we &apos;ll be in opposition to them , we will contact their players , &quot; said Al @-@ K@@ hel@@ ai@@ fi .
&quot; we respect all clubs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but if they try to sign one of our players , this will have consequences . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Barcelona seems to have crossed this line , with the Spanish association expressed interest in the PS@@ G mid@@ fiel@@ der Marco Ver@@ r@@ atti at the beginning of this summer .
PS@@ G made it clear that they would not allow the International from Italy to leave under any circum@@ stance , and Barcelona could feel the consequences of this interest by losing one of their price offers for N@@ ey@@ mar .

interview : &quot; Dom@@ sp@@ atzen report reli@@ eves Pope brother Georg R@@ atz@@ inger &quot;
the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen Report on the mis@@ use cases reli@@ eves Pope brother Georg R@@ atz@@ inger .
this is what author and historian Michael Hes@@ emann believes .
the final report on the mis@@ use sc@@ andal at the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen provides further discussion .
Christian Wei@@ sn@@ der , spokes@@ man for the reform movement &quot; We are Church , &quot; declared after publication in front of the Deutsche Presse @-@ Agentur , he acquired an ap@@ ology from the former Regensburg Bishop and present @-@ day Cardinal Gerhard Ludwig Müller as well as by the Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , the 93 @-@ year @-@ old brother of the Pope Bene@@ dict XVI .
it would serve the reputation of the Catholic Church greatly if Müller and R@@ atz@@ inger expressed their deep regret about their own om@@ is@@ sions or their false app@@ rais@@ al of the processes at that time .
on the other hand , the Vatican newspaper &quot; Os@@ serv@@ at@@ ore Rom@@ ano &quot; critici@@ zed the fact that in the reporting of violence in the domains of the cathedral , &quot; double standards &quot; were measured .
with regard to the ass@@ aults in Regensburg nobody doubts that it is &quot; sham@@ eful and sham@@ eful acts , &quot; which should be punished and prevented in the future . however , the &quot; degree of medi@@ al manipulation , &quot; says the author Luc@@ etta Scar@@ aff@@ ia , historian and member of the national Italian Bio@@ ethics committee .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the habit of den@@ ounc@@ ing the Catholic Church as a source of all ev@@ ils is already part of everyday life and prepares public opinion to keep it normal , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; writes Scar@@ aff@@ ia . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Princess Gl@@ oria von Th@@ urn und Ta@@ xis also said in an interview with Bay@@ erischer Rundfunk : &quot; you like to go to the church and that &apos;s a frozen food . &quot;
she also pointed out that &quot; stro@@ kes were a very normal educational tool &quot; in their youth , &quot; in order to cope with che@@ ek@@ y children , as I was one . &quot;
they find it unfair to apply today &apos;s standards to previous decades , as the world has changed .
in connection with the reports on mis@@ use cases , pop@@ e @-@ brother Georg R@@ atz@@ inger often appeared .
fully justified , author and historian Michael Hes@@ emann , who wrote with R@@ atz@@ inger the &quot; My Brother of the Pope &quot; ( translated into 12 languages ) .
&quot; I have to take refuge in Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , &quot; says Hes@@ emann , &quot; because all this had nothing to do with him , &quot; he analyses the results of the final report .
what exactly is the 440 @-@ page report commissioned by the B@@ ist@@ um Regensburg with the En@@ ligh@@ tenment attorney Ulrich Weber ?
a total of 5@@ 47 Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen were sexually ab@@ used between 1945 and the beginning of the 1990s &quot; with high plau@@ sibility . &quot;
in the final report it is called Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , who worked in Regensburg from 1964 to 1994 : &quot; in summary , the fact that Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister R. was used in many cases of physical and psychological violence .
especially with a high level of emotion@@ ality , the punishment for the students was even more severe .
however , in contrast to numerous other alleg@@ ations , many victims have estimated the general humanity of R. and , in many cases , even combine positive memories with him in many cases . &quot;
in the interview , Hes@@ emann explains why the final report on the mis@@ use sc@@ andal at the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen Georg R@@ atz@@ inger is reli@@ eved of his opinion .
Mr Hes@@ emann , the 440 @-@ page report on the &quot; incidents of violent exercise on protective animals in the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen &quot; gives a contradic@@ tory picture of Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger .
for one , many students emphasize his &quot; humanity . &quot;
on the other hand , it also appears as a ch@@ ol@@ eri@@ ker and perfec@@ tion@@ ist , who has become hand @-@ gr@@ asp@@ ed by the Ö@@ f@@ teren when a domain record musi@@ cally did not bring any top performance .
how do you evaluate this final report as his bi@@ ograph@@ er ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : if you take the trouble and read the whole 440 pages long report from the front to the back , you have to ask yourself why the name Georg R@@ atz@@ inger appears at all in it .
he is even dedicated to eight pages and he is clearly exemp@@ ted from any suspicion of complic@@ ity or complic@@ ity in the terrible cases of sexual abuse .
the exc@@ esses of violence at the pres@@ ch@@ ool also took place outside of his sphere of work .
at best , one can reproach him , learn from it too late or not have taken the first hints seriously enough .
the physical gymn@@ asi@@ um , on which he worked , was perceived as literally &quot; redemption , &quot; &quot; heaven &quot; and &quot; better world . &quot;
the vast majority of his students , Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , also exemp@@ li@@ fies an excellent testimony , describes him as &quot; warm hear@@ ted , &quot; &quot; sincere , &quot; &quot; competent , &quot; and &quot; understanding , &quot; as extremely good @-@ nat@@ ured teachers , who supplied the boys regularly with cakes , bis@@ cuits and cand@@ y and &quot; always surrounded by grapes of children . &quot;
only a minority compl@@ ains about its perfec@@ tion@@ ism and its high emotion@@ ality , which has also led to her@@ nia .
the fact that he did not only b@@ ang with chairs and threw the key@@ ring on the ground , but also put ear @-@ cow@@ ards distributed and too nau@@ ghty boys to the hair or ears , he himself had admitted years ago , deeply regre@@ ts and ap@@ ologi@@ zed for it .
to its salvation , however , it must be said that such educational methods were widespread in the period in question , the 1960s and 1970s , with parents as with teachers .
do you know such methods of breeding ?
of course , I think each of us who was born before 1968 .
I also experienced this in a secular school , a state gymn@@ asi@@ um .
compared to what is actually going on in this report , namely the horri@@ fic sexual abuse and violent exc@@ esses at the pres@@ ch@@ ool , these are ad@@ mitt@@ edly dre@@ at@@ balls .
one wonders whether it is not with his famili@@ arity and his role as brother of Bene@@ dict XVI that many media have just rus@@ hed to him .
many who have never understood him are still working di@@ lig@@ ently in the Bavarian pop@@ e .
but the truth is : the report reli@@ eves Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in every respect !
the media reported a great deal about the abuse of the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen .
in the final report , Georg R@@ atz@@ inger is also charged with any involvement or involvement with regard to sexual abuse ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : clearly no .
not a single of the 67 victims of sexual assault claims to be entrusted to the Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister .
not even the parents were inaugurated .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I never dar@@ ed to talk about it with my father or my mother , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said an affected person for the others , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; It was all very embarrass@@ ing to me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the real problem in the clari@@ fication of sexual abuse was and is , however , that most victims are silent .
if they were not even familiar with parents and si@@ bl@@ ings , it would not be a ch@@ oral director who would have been a colleague of the cul@@ pr@@ its .
how do the Dom@@ sp@@ atzen students evaluate R@@ atz@@ inger &apos;s role in terms of mis@@ use cases ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : a du@@ bi@@ ous student formulated it like this : &quot; regarding sexual abuse ... I see ... no case in which he ( Georg R@@ atz@@ inger ) had had timely findings and could have been able to stop the respective perpet@@ r@@ ator .
I think it ... also for really absurd to assume that ... Bu@@ ben have opened themselves more intru@@ sive and clear or even more open than to their parents , dormit@@ ory managers , trust teachers , etc .
that one speaks with him about sex ... - think@@ able . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is how the report conclu@@ des with the clear result : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that in the run @-@ up affected students and / or their environment , could not be confirmed in the course of the investigation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
as far as sexual abuse is concerned , Georg R@@ atz@@ inger is thus free to speak of any co @-@ worker .
thus it cannot be accused of preventing it or bringing it to the ad .
therefore , there is no reason to associate his good name with these crimes against him , as happened in some cases .
in the media much of &quot; violent eating &quot; was to be read at the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen .
the former Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger is thrown into the report &quot; Look at . &quot;
does he have to live with this reproach ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : this is the big problem that everything is mixed and mixed up in the coverage of a huge mel@@ ange of sexual abuse and violence and somewhere , in the middle of it , Georg R@@ atz@@ inger .
but that is , in turn , a mis@@ use of the report .
there is a clean separation : between the pres@@ ch@@ ool and the gymn@@ asi@@ um of the domain pads , between sexual abuse and violent exc@@ esses as well as , let &apos;s say , other alleg@@ ations .
in addition , the report deals with incidents from the period since 1945 , thus also from four decades in which Georg R@@ atz@@ inger was not choir director of the Dom@@ sp@@ atzen .
the whole horri@@ ble test pedago@@ gy , the cases in which the boys of sa@@ di@@ stic teachers were mis@@ guided and mal@@ ig@@ ned and suffered terri@@ bly , all took place at the pre @-@ school in Et@@ ter@@ z@@ hausen and P@@ iel@@ en@@ ho@@ fen , where really sc@@ andal@@ ous conditions had to prevail .
but with whom Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister had nothing to do with Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , because he only got the boy to face when they were already at the Dom@@ as@@ atz@@ eng@@ gy@@ asi@@ um .
on this was , as most witnesses pointed out , the subject of &quot; pre @-@ school &quot; tab@@ oo .
you were only happy to be able to escape and enjoyed the much better treatment and for many even &quot; heavenly &quot; conditions .
what was different in the gymn@@ asi@@ um ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : there was discipline already , but no sa@@ di@@ stic force .
and this is also true for Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , in which the report conclu@@ des that &quot; many victims appreciated the general humanity of R. and , in many cases , even combine positive memories with him in numerous cases . &quot;
at most , the blame remains to be taken away .
but despite all efforts , the report could only define two periods in which it was reported by the states at the pres@@ ch@@ ool .
the first time in 1970 / 71 , when he began to establish himself and from the events at a school where he was not working and was responsible , ( so the witness ) did not want to hear anything , and then again in 1993 .
did Georg R@@ atz@@ inger consistently shut the ears in front of the states ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : no , because in 1989 he wrote a letter to the director of the physical gymn@@ asi@@ um , who even reproduced the report .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in this he points out this , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that in the pre @-@ school the audi@@ ting penalty will continue to be practi@@ sed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in view of the danger of negative press reviews , he recommended an urgent intervention .
this was , of course , at a time when legal clarity existed , as audi@@ ting pun@@ ish@@ ments were forbidden in Bavaria long ago .
before that , they took place in a legal grey area , as each of us probably knows .
it was difficult for him to guess where the persons affected might be exagger@@ ated or dramati@@ sed and where really the permissible limit had been exceeded .
but you can &apos;t say that he has always looked away .
that &apos;s just not right .
only in 1980 , the testing of schools in Bavaria was officially aboli@@ shed .
Princess Gl@@ oria von Th@@ urn und Ta@@ xis insist@@ ed that it is unfair to apply today &apos;s educational standards to the time of that time .
how do you see that ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : we histori@@ ans speak of the &quot; sn@@ are of an@@ ach@@ ron@@ ism , &quot; i.e. the danger of evaluating the past according to today &apos;s moral standards .
the princess has already been right .
but this is of course not true for sexual abuse , which was det@@ ri@@ mental at all times , and not for what was broken at the pre @-@ school of ad@@ versity and violence against innocent children &apos;s souls , that goes far beyond the usual practice .
this is all horri@@ ble and I am glad that it will finally be re@@ conditioned .
but at the same time I have to take refuge in Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , because all that had nothing to do with him .
its means for discipl@@ ining and punishment , i.e. to pull ear @-@ cow@@ ards and to the hair and ears , were widespread in the 1970s .
when physical punishment was then forbidden , it has kept strict adher@@ ence to it .
what picture of his Regensburg time has Georg R@@ atz@@ inger reproduced in the talks with you for the book &quot; My Brother of the Pope &quot; ?
did the subject of audi@@ ting also come to language ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : well , in the book it is about the life of his brother Joseph , thus Pope Bene@@ dict XVI , tells from his perspective that the Dom@@ sp@@ atzen played only a minor role .
nevertheless , I do not devi@@ ate from the fact that he led a strict regi@@ ment there .
but even this must be said once : without this perfec@@ tion@@ ism , without demanding discipline , it would hardly have been possible for him to form an institution of world @-@ tran@@ g from the hitherto rather nation@@ ally known Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen , true cultural ambass@@ adors of Europe and his musical tradition , which went on tour twice in the USA ( 1983 and 1987 ) and Japan ( 1988 and 1991 ) .
with bis@@ cuits and cand@@ y alone , the un@@ ru@@ ly boys are not once a big singer and stand before every success , regardless of what area , but always discipline , passion and overcoming .
what kind of man did you experience with Georg R@@ atz@@ inger during the talks to her book ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : through the work on the book and in addition , I met Georg R@@ atz@@ inger very well and again and again experienced as wonderful , humor@@ ous , basic @-@ minded , deeply believing and hear@@ ty people , of whom one can &apos;t imagine that he could even hurt a fly a little .
I get regular contact with him on a regular basis , like many ex @-@ cats today , 23 years after his retirement , visit him , read him - he is almost blind - and treat him like a member of her family .
those who have not forgiven him until today , that he was once strictly speaking to them , are thus un@@ equi@@ voc@@ ally in the minority .
most of the Dom@@ sp@@ atzen are thank@@ ful to him today that he has enriched their lives and told them the world of music .
and that he is always a good , fa@@ ther@@ ly teacher - a strict father , certainly , that may be - but also a lovely respect person , to which they still look up today and which they almost worship .
and please , once again , clearly : all that is accused of him are educational methods that were on the agenda at that time .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we can be happy that we have long over@@ came this time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but it is most un@@ just to make a man just because he is prominent and has a more prominent brother to make a medi@@ al sc@@ ap@@ ego@@ at .
there is the evil intent behind it , only too obvious .
because the report , which was just published , reli@@ eved him .
now the anarch@@ ist would command a 93 @-@ year @-@ old man who acquired great mer@@ its and without the outside of Bavaria and perhaps no one would know the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen .
