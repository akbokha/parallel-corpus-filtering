<seg id="3">A crypt where it is now dug for the S-Bahn tunnel.</seg>
<seg id="4">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "farmers cultivate the former land of farmers." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="5">The oldest official map of Munich promotes exciting stories on days.</seg>
<seg id="6">It annoys when maps are not up-to-date.</seg>
<seg id="7">Everybody knows this, who had to upset already, because the car navigation system showed a green meadow instead of a bypass road.</seg>
<seg id="8">The historical maps of the digital Bayern-Atlases, an offer of the geoportas Bavaria of the state government, are anything but up-to-date - but very insightful.</seg>
<seg id="9">Especially when comparing them with current online cards.</seg>
<seg id="10">Then it becomes clear how towns and communities have changed in the spread-area of the Munich Mercury since the 19th century.</seg>
<seg id="11">The digital Bayern-Atlas is a Flickenteppich, which one does not recognize as such.</seg>
<seg id="12">In the big picture postcard, more detailed maps, so-called "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "", were incorporated into the big picture postcard. "" "" "" "</seg>
<seg id="13">According to the Bavarian surveying management, these were created between 1810 and 1864 and originate from Bavaria's first survey.</seg>
<seg id="14">Your principal: Napoleon.</seg>
<seg id="15">The French army leader occupied Bavaria since the spring of 1800 during the Second Coalition War with Austria.</seg>
<seg id="16">Napoleon wanted an overview of the occupied country and commissioned a topographic survey of Bavaria - of course for military purposes.</seg>
<seg id="17">Even though the French troops stopped at the peace of Lunéville on February 9, 1801, it was the neighbours of today who created the idea of an area-wide area of Bavaria.</seg>
<seg id="18">Elector Max IV Joseph drove the project forward, founded the "Topographic Bureau" - and thus the Bavarian surveying management.</seg>
<seg id="19">The composition sheet for Munich dates back to 1856 and can be found on the Bayerische Landesbibliothek as well as any other on the website of the Bavarian State Library.</seg>
<seg id="20">The comparison of early / today is the most impressive example of the state capital.</seg>
<seg id="21">The city has expanded in all directions and has grown together.</seg>
<seg id="22">One example of this is Untersendling, which appears relatively isolated in the map of 1856.</seg>
<seg id="23">Sendling was built 21 years after the map was created, i.e. in 1877, as the Munich suburb.</seg>
<seg id="24">Today, Untersendling is located in the middle of the city.</seg>
<seg id="25">The houses of Untersendlings are concentrated around 1856 along the present-day Plinganserstrasse, which was first named after Georg Sebastian Plinganser in 1878, a leader of the uprising of the Bavarian peasants against Austria in 1705.</seg>
<seg id="26">Where today is the Westpark, one does not see anything as fields - at first glance: when zooming in, a smaller card with dozens of lines and numbers appears: hand-numbered flakes from the so-called "primeval" from which the basic tax was derived.</seg>
<seg id="27">Small plots have no farmers today, but small gardeners of the facility "Land in Sun."</seg>
<seg id="28">A large green area is characterized north of Untersendling.</seg>
<seg id="29">Theresienwiese, the scene of the Oktoberfest in 1810, was actually still a meadow - and no concrete desert.</seg>
<seg id="30">On the other side of the Isar, the historical map gives an insight into the history of psychiatric medicine.</seg>
<seg id="31">In the data sheet, in the area of the present district Au-Haidhausen, one reads not only the street name "at the Gasteig" or from the height "On the Lüfts" - but also in large letters "Irren Anstalt."</seg>
<seg id="32">Yes, here at the Auerfeldstraße you once locked people with insanity.</seg>
<seg id="33">In 1858 / 59 the Munich-based Irrenanstalt district "On the Auer Lüfts" was created.</seg>
<seg id="34">From 1872, Dr. Bernhard von Gudden headed the institution - that psychiatrist, who is brought in connection with the death of King Ludwig II.</seg>
<seg id="35">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "he was progressive for his time and ended, for example, the Kadets of so-called Irish." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="36">Moreover, he prohibited the staff to use violence against the occupants, "says Hermann Wilhelm, head of the museum Haidhausen, who worked for an exhibition with the institution.</seg>
<seg id="37">For 280 patients was first place, later extended to 500 places.</seg>
<seg id="38">At some point, this capacity was no longer sufficient - the reason for the construction of the Kreisirrenanstalt in Haar 1905.</seg>
<seg id="39">The Isar-Amper-Klinikum Munich-Ost, one of Germany's largest psychiatrists, has been there since 2006.</seg>
<seg id="40">Young people now meet at Salesianum in Munich.</seg>
<seg id="41">The Order acquired the building complex in 1920 and converted it into a youth home with training facilities.</seg>
<seg id="42">West is the football field of the TSV München East, east residential buildings from the 1980s.</seg>
<seg id="43">In 2015, the children's house "Casa Don Bosco" was built in an architectural approach to the original building of the Irrenanstalt, which was destroyed during the Second World War in bomb attacks.</seg>
<seg id="44">The Marienplatz was listed in 1856 as the "main square," the Kaufingerstrasse was called "Kaufinger Gasse."</seg>
<seg id="45">The Second World War also brought a decisive change in the heart of Munich.</seg>
<seg id="46">The bombs of the Allies broke many holes in the inner city in December 1944.</seg>
<seg id="47">A large remained until today - at the Marienhof.</seg>
<seg id="48">The English Institute, small business houses and a crypt chapel from the Middle Ages once stood at Marienhof, where these days were the preparatory work and on 5 April 2017 the groundbreaking ceremony for the second S-Bahn track.</seg>
<seg id="49">With the slider you can compare the old Munich Map with the aerial view of today - and fill the hole at the Marienhof.</seg>
<seg id="50">Civil Rights Group publishes travel warning for Missouri</seg>
<seg id="51">The National Association for the Promotion of Farmers has issued a warning for coloured people travelling to Missouri due to discriminatory policies and racist attacks.</seg>
<seg id="52">"the NAACP Travel Advisory for the State of Missouri, which is expected to enter into force by August 28, 2017, calls on Afro-American travelers, visitors and Missouri to take special attention while travelling through the state, as a number of questionable, racial occurrences appear in the entire state and be noted here," says the Group's opinion.</seg>
<seg id="53">A recently passed law of Missouri, which makes it harder for people to win discrimination complaints, as well as the state prosecuting authorities that disproportionately aim at minorities, prompted the group to issue the warning, the NAACP said.</seg>
<seg id="54">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "they have violations of civil rights that happen to humans." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="55">They are stopped because of their skin colour, they are beaten or killed, "said the president of Missouri NAACP, Rod Chapel, the Kansas City Star.</seg>
<seg id="56">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "we hear complaints in such a frequency that we have not yet heard." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="57">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "it is the first such warning that the organization has issued for a state in the US." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="58">The group quoted cases like racial offences against black students at the University of Missouri and the death of Tory Sanders, 28, a black man from Tennessee.</seg>
<seg id="59">Sanders died under questionable circumstances at the beginning of the year, after he had no more fuel during the journey through the state and was put into custody by the Missouri police, without being accused of a crime.</seg>
<seg id="60">The Council also points to a recent report by the Missouri Office of the Missouri Office, where it is shown that black motorists in the state will increase 75 percent more frequently than whites.</seg>
<seg id="61">"the recommendation is that people are aware and inform their families, friends and employees about what could happen in Missouri," Chapel said.</seg>
<seg id="62">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "people need to be willing to bring a deposit money or let relatives know that they travel through the state." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="63">Missouri reported 100 hate crimes in 2015, according to the latest figures from the FBI Hassan Crimes report, which ranks the state in terms of the number of such violations to the 16th place of the country.</seg>
<seg id="64">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "the travel warning is also an answer to a new Missouri law that would make it more difficult to accuse a company for housing or employment discrimination." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="65">Previously, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) issued travel warnings for Texas and Arizona after the States had passed immigration laws to suspend local law enforcement agencies to arrest people on the basis of ACLU's further race profile.</seg>
<seg id="66">Travel warnings are usually issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for other countries, but lately, interest groups have used the measure as a response to certain laws and trends within the United States.</seg>
<seg id="67">Electric fence project is elementary</seg>
<seg id="68">The Fischerbacher Weidezaun project is a successful project and will be continued next year.</seg>
<seg id="69">The CDU Members Peter Weiß and Kordula Kovac have taken a picture on the spot.</seg>
<seg id="70">Representatives of the Fisbacher CDU local association met with mayor Thomas Schneider and the two deputies at the Schwendemann family's square yard.</seg>
<seg id="71">Markus Schwendemann first gave insights into his farm, in which he manages 55 hectares of meadows and 40 hectares of forest, 40 dairy cows and equally many juveniles, and is accommodated in five apartments.</seg>
<seg id="72">"" "" "" "the" "" "" "" "Black Forest" "" "" "" "is for him the alternative marketing path for the milk of his cows," "" "" "" "Schwendemann." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="73">On the table of the Feriengaste comes exclusively Regionales.</seg>
<seg id="74">Since he is also the chairman of BLHV of Fisherbach, he described the decipher project as "elementary important."</seg>
<seg id="75">I cannot profit on such steep surfaces.</seg>
<seg id="76">The grassland area care for a lot of work, much needed to be handled with the brushcutter.</seg>
<seg id="77">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "we have to fight here with the conditions and with the topography," "" "" "" "said Schwendemann." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="78">In 2003 he took over the parental farm and managed it without chemical plant protection and fertiliser, even if he does not conduct organic farming.</seg>
<seg id="79">For mayor Thomas Schneider it was clear: "the Commune has recognised the importance of the fence project and is glad about the leaders" promotion. "</seg>
<seg id="80">At the cost of 3000 to 4000 euros per hectare, farmers need to be supported.</seg>
<seg id="81">I hope that the afforestation of the areas could be pulled out for quite a while.</seg>
<seg id="82">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "the greatest treasure we have are the people who work in agriculture and think about how they will continue their operations," "" "" "" "said the mayor." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="83">Farmers are often in criticism because of the promotion</seg>
<seg id="84">In 2013, a total of 25 parcels were fenced by eleven participants.</seg>
<seg id="85">The area of disclosure amounts to 40 hectares, which cannot be forested by at least 2023.</seg>
<seg id="86">Half of the total cost of EUR 71 500 was promoted by leader, a quarter bore the municipality of Fischbach.</seg>
<seg id="87">Thus the farmers remained 12 610 euros, which they had to invest in 16.2 kilometres of pasture-fence.</seg>
<seg id="88">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "the great advantage is the longevity of the fences," "" "" "" "declared Schwendemann." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="89">Kordula Kovac stressed: "you are doing a really good job, without farmers and landwives."</seg>
<seg id="90">Peter Weiß asserts that "the best foods are produced here."</seg>
<seg id="91">The landscape care line (LPR) Baden-Wuerttemberg enables the state support of soft fences.</seg>
<seg id="92">The goal is to keep the Black Forest open.</seg>
<seg id="93">The pre-requisite is the presence of a circulating system registered by the LPR.</seg>
<seg id="94">Moreover, the fencing surface must not be traceable (slope over 35 percent) and must therefore be threatened by afforestation.</seg>
<seg id="95">At present, eight participants with 24 parcels, who want to build just under 16 kilometres of fence, are currently working for the Fishersbach Weightstarter project 2018.</seg>
<seg id="96">The area of disclosure corresponds to 35 hectares, and the calculated costs are more than 112 000 euros.</seg>
<seg id="97">Is nothing more holy?</seg>
<seg id="98">Now the White House of Trump takes the Statue of Liberty</seg>
<seg id="99">The safest sign of a regime change is when they begin to attack the statues.</seg>
<seg id="100">The Americans appreciate these as well as any other - therefore the carefully staged fall of Saddam Hussein at the Firdos square in Baghdad in 2003.</seg>
<seg id="101">Stephen Miller, one of the key ideologists of the Trump regime, certainly knew what he did when he took a symbolic axe in a heated argument with Jim Acosta of CNN about the President's proposals for the drastic restriction of legal immigration with the Statue of Liberty.</seg>
<seg id="102">To be fair, Miller did not handle the statue itself.</seg>
<seg id="103">A horde of boat owners and Liberty-Imiteers would have liked him if he had done it.</seg>
<seg id="104">But it took on its importance, and in particular the meaning that it was attributed to, when the famous poem by Emma Lazarus was added 17 years after the completion of the monument, its base.</seg>
<seg id="105">When Miller picked up Acosta, "I don't want to go into a complete thing about history here, but the Statue of Liberty is... a symbol of American freedom that enlightens the world.</seg>
<seg id="106">The poem you refer to is later added and is not part of the original Statue of Liberty. "</seg>
<seg id="107">Miller is factually correct, but as he formulated it himself, it's not really about history.</seg>
<seg id="108">It is about the contemporary response to the touching words of Lazarus, the only ones in which a state invites not only any old immigrants, but the poorest of the poor: "your tired, your poor, / your oppressed masses, who yearn to breathe freely, the miserable drop of your rich coasts."</seg>
<seg id="109">"" "" "" "there was never a time when" "" "" "" "poor apostasy" "" "" "" "was better to see on our screens." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="110">Miller was not engaged in literary criticism - he made it clear that these people in Trumps USA are not welcome.</seg>
<seg id="111">This conflict because of the importance of a statue is part of a broader political and cultural debate: it is in fact a conflict around the significance of America.</seg>
<seg id="112">Lazarus - and her friends who used to place their words after their death at the base - knew very well that they took up a highly political action.</seg>
<seg id="113">The sculpture was intended to show the connections between French and American republicanism by presenting the feminine embodiment of freedom in a worn classic portrayal.</seg>
<seg id="114">Lazarus has changed this meaning: in her poem the female figure is no longer abstracted - she has received a voice.</seg>
<seg id="115">And she herself has a completely different name: mother of exiles.</seg>
<seg id="116">The compound of the poem with the image is a brilliant feminist coup and a devastating attack on American Nativism.</seg>
<seg id="117">And just as Lazarus had changed the meaning of the statue, the people of the right wing wanted to change it for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="118">The great writer Rush Limbaugh, a type of John the Baptist for the coming of Trump, argued in 2010 that the Statue of Liberty would not invite anyone but rather an early neo-conservative, who brings the American flame to the surrounding world: "Lady Liberty goes forward.</seg>
<seg id="119">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "it shall bear the torch of freedom from the United States to the rest of the world." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="120">"" "" "" "the torch should not enlighten the way to the United States." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="121">Rather unusual is Limbaugh stumbled on something here.</seg>
<seg id="122">The meaning of the statue is quite a question of the point of view of perception.</seg>
<seg id="123">The great imaginative act of Lazarus was to see them as they were seen by the exhausted, eleventful, but hopeful people after long and often terrible journeys on the decks of ships.</seg>
<seg id="124">It is about seeing the world from the perspective of people who seek refuge and a chance to improve their lives.</seg>
<seg id="125">Her statue speaks to them the words of hope and the welcome they need to hear.</seg>
<seg id="126">And that is, of course, not the perspective that Miller and Trump would ever acknowledge.</seg>
<seg id="127">Their torch should not enlighten the way, but to ignite hatred that is their only source of power.</seg>

<seg id="129">Eilidh Doyle reminisces about a time when only two Scotsmen belonged to the Team of Britain</seg>
<seg id="130">The performance director of the United Kingdom's Athletics, Neil Black, says that the 16-strong Scottish contingent in world championship cadres will make a massive contribution to the team. "</seg>

<seg id="136">British Athletics: it has something to do with what they have done.</seg>
<seg id="137">And also with the type at the corner.</seg>
<seg id="138">Whatever the combination of circumstances is, it's absolutely brilliant. "</seg>
<seg id="139">Several of the Scottish athletes are medals, including Laura Muir and Andrew Butchart - who are competing against Sir Mo Farah on the 5,000 m distance, while Eilidh Doyle was chosen by the team captain.</seg>
<seg id="140">"Eilidh is quite modest.</seg>
<seg id="141">Their Captain's speech was incredible, "says Black.</seg>
<seg id="142">"a number of athletes, whether they were Scottish or wherever they live or train, went out of space and felt very proud and were very motivated.</seg>
<seg id="143">"" "" "" "the passion and the real feeling that Eilidh naturally brought in were great." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="144">The Commonwealth silver medal winner, who will compete for the 400-m hurdles at their fifth world championships, says it is "unbelievable" that 16 Scots are in the British team.</seg>
<seg id="145">Scotland's best total number of athletes at the World Cup was seven, which were achieved in 1983 and 2015.</seg>
<seg id="146">The middle-distance runner, Muir, is leading this way and has set five British and two European records last year.</seg>
<seg id="147">It will take part at the 1,500 m and the 5,000 m runs.</seg>
<seg id="148">Chris O'Hare, who runs 1,500 m, is another Scotsman to watch for a great season that included winning the British Team Trials and Anniversary Games.</seg>
<seg id="149">Doyle remembers her first world championships as the only other Scotsman in Team Lee McConnell.</seg>
<seg id="150">The team captain says that they are "hugely proud" of the fact that many of their compatriots are not only part of the team, but in some cases also join the medals and the finals.</seg>
<seg id="151">"the special thing about being a team captain is that it was chosen by the other members of the team, so it was a great honour anyway, but knowing that my teammate voted for me and chose me makes it something special for me," she added.</seg>
<seg id="152">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "obviously I am very proud of all the Scots belonging to the team." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="153">It only shows how far we came.</seg>
<seg id="154">And they are here as well-established athletes, athletes who want to climb to podiums.</seg>
<seg id="155">What does my speech refer to as a Captain?</seg>
<seg id="156">Yes, I think she went well.</seg>
<seg id="157">I have only pointed out that we are very happy in this situation as we have a home world championship.</seg>
<seg id="158">So it is really important to rely on this support and benefit from the fact that we are in the Olympiastadion again.</seg>

<seg id="160">Block critics on Facebook: do not apply for a public office if you cannot tolerate the heating of voters</seg>
<seg id="161">The father of our country knew something of bad press.</seg>
<seg id="162">The Americans loved George Washington, but it did not take long until the newspapers hit him because of everything, from domestic politics to his political principles.</seg>
<seg id="163">He knocked at the critique, for sure.</seg>
<seg id="164">But he did not silence his critics.</seg>
<seg id="165">"" "" "" "in 1783, Washington said:" "" "" "" "freedom of speech can be taken away - and, stupid and mute we are led like sheep for slaughter." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="166">That brings me to Maryland to Governor Larry Hogan who has to work to be more like Washington.</seg>
<seg id="167">Hogan's employees have blocked and deleted the contributions of at least 450 people who have expressed their opinion on his official Facebook page.</seg>
<seg id="168">And the American Civil Liberties Union therefore complained about it at the beginning of this week.</seg>
<seg id="169">The Governor's staff dismissed the complaint as frivolous, and the online comment was full of a counter-reaction with "Na, and?."</seg>
<seg id="170">"it's just Facebook," many people said.</seg>
<seg id="171">But it is important.</seg>
<seg id="172">And it is especially important if it is a type like Hogan.</seg>
<seg id="173">This is a republican governor in an overwhelming democratic state which is amazingly popular.</seg>
<seg id="174">He has the second highest consent of the nation's 50 governors.</seg>
<seg id="175">Hogan is not a reactionary heat-head.</seg>
<seg id="176">He has demonstrated a strong hand in the leadership of his state and strict adherence to the principles.</seg>
<seg id="177">He was also very skilful in using Facebook as a primary means to connect with his electors and to depress his hair-less head after chemotherapy on his side.</seg>
<seg id="178">Therefore, the blockage of persons coming to the governors "side is unnecessarily and ultimately dangerous for employees who are paid with public tax dollars.</seg>
<seg id="179">In an interview with The Washington Post, Hogan's spokesperson, Amelia Chasse, defended the actions of the governor and argued that blocking the comments was nothing more than a facilitation.</seg>
<seg id="180">But it is too easy to use the image of trolls or spammers or hateful people who swing the whip online.</seg>
<seg id="181">The post talked to some of the real people who were blocked by Hogan.</seg>
<seg id="182">And these are only real people who speak with their elected leaders: a teacher, an entrepreneur and a priest, no trolls.</seg>
<seg id="183">They all said their comments were respectful, thoughtful and non-profane.</seg>
<seg id="184">The priest quoted the Bible in his post and appealed to Hogans Catholic faith.</seg>
<seg id="185">Lawyer Lakshmi Sarma Ramani of Bowie, Md., was not crowded, but she asked for hate crimes.</seg>
<seg id="186">"I said politely that I was disappointed that there was no reaction to hate crimes and other current news," she wrote in the comment section of the news broadcast "The Post."</seg>
<seg id="187">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "I don't like this idea, if a number of people take a position on the same subject, then they are disregarded by some rather than a so-called collective commitment and not recognized as a large group of affected citizens." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="188">"" "" "" "what the Governor's staff marked as" "" "" "" "concentrated spam" "" "" "" "would probably call" "" "" "" "intercession." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="189">The Facebook era simply makes it easy to cut a message by simply blocking a critic or dropping a negative comment.</seg>
<seg id="190">It is much cleaner than in earlier times, if you have done the same thing that employees have been sent to collect and burn newspapers with critical cormorants or to arrest and silence demonstrators.</seg>
<seg id="191">But that's exactly what happens digitally.</seg>
<seg id="192">Hogan is not the first public official to criticize Facebook and other social media.</seg>
<seg id="193">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "President Trump is accused of Twitter users who were blocked by his Twitter feed." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="194">One of the first milestones in this issue was last week in Virginia.</seg>
<seg id="195">The Chairman of the Board of Supervisors of the Loudoun County injured the First Amendment, according to US District Judge James C. Cacheris in Alexandria, when she banned a voter from her Facebook page.</seg>
<seg id="196">And in Kentucky, Governor Matt Bevin (R) also received a visit from the ACLU because of his use of Facebook and Twitter.</seg>
<seg id="197">This should not be so difficult.</seg>
<seg id="198">At the time of Washington, the time of affordable payments had a similar effect as the internet.</seg>
<seg id="199">The number of newspapers was multiplied between 1776 and 1800, and anonymous letters of letters fell on his lead.</seg>
<seg id="200">And even then, Washington had anonymous trolls.</seg>
<seg id="201">The people who used pseudonyms like "juricola," "Valerius," "Belisarius" and "Portius" wrote all the letters to newspapers that made Washington decisions.</seg>
<seg id="202">Petitions criticized his position on the Treaty of Amity, the trade and shipping with Britain, overcame his ministry, according to the historical documents collected by the online Papers of the George Washington Project.</seg>

<seg id="274">However, these riches are a source of misery for the Papua, ensuring that Indonesia's powerful military keeps a suffocating presence.</seg>
<seg id="275">An investigation of 2005 in the New York Times reported that Freeport paid almost $20 million local military and units between 1998 and 2004, including up to 150,000 U.S. dollars to a single officer.</seg>

<seg id="304">Yeremias Kayame, 56, the leader of the Kego Koto quarter of Enarotali, saw the impending danger and called for peace and called for the crowd to return home.</seg>

<seg id="337">On Tuesday, the Indonesian police fired on villagers in Paniais neighborhood of Deiyai.</seg>
<seg id="338">During a confrontation between villagers and the manager of a construction company who refused to bring a unconscious man to hospital, one person and 17 others were injured, including children.</seg>
<seg id="339">The man, the 24-year-old Ravianus Douw, who was drowned when he fished in a nearby river, died on the way to the hospital.</seg>
<seg id="340">Excited villagers protested in front of the company's site.</seg>
<seg id="341">The police said that the villagers threw stones on officers who responded by firing a warning.</seg>
<seg id="342">But locals say that the mobile brigade (Indonesian paramilitary police) began to shoot at the crowd and killed one.</seg>
<seg id="343">"we were so in panic, we are afraid that there will be vengeance," says the 29-year-old Dominggu Badii, who lives near the hospital and witnessed how the injured had been delivered here quickly, such as the TIME.</seg>
<seg id="344">"I have hidden myself two days in my house."</seg>
<seg id="345">The Deiyai Parliament has called upon to take account of the officers involved and withdraw the mobile brigade of the police from the area.</seg>
<seg id="346">Paniai was always a rudder for the Indonesian government.</seg>
<seg id="347">The lack of meaningful development strengthens the discontent of the family members Mee, Moni, Dani and damal, who live in the green highlands of Papua.</seg>
<seg id="348">Many joined the Free Papua Movement (OPM), the rebel army claiming to defend the rights of the Papua by launching sporadic attacks and kidnappings of Indonesian soldiers.</seg>
<seg id="349">Some of the top OPM leaders came from Paniai, including Tadius Yogi and Daniel Yuden Kogoya.</seg>
<seg id="350">In response to this, thousands of people in Paniai were arrested and arbitrarily taken into custody under the pretext of "securing national sovereignty."</seg>
<seg id="351">Some never appear again.</seg>
<seg id="352">Among the people of Papua, Paniai is known as "a tragic, forgotten place."</seg>
<seg id="353">Poverty strengthens the discontent.</seg>
<seg id="354">The little rice sold in Enarotali is too expensive for locals.</seg>
<seg id="355">Bread is just as out of reach.</seg>
<seg id="356">The people here build everything they eat: especially nota and fruit and leafy vegetables.</seg>
<seg id="357">Agriculture is the task of women who can process four or five fields of sweet potato each.</seg>
<seg id="358">They keep most of the harvest for the family while the rest is sold on the local market.</seg>
<seg id="359">Ten pieces of Nota cost only 10,000 Indonesian rupees (75 Cents).</seg>
<seg id="360">Over time, economic inequalities have grown between the native Papua and the new migrants who have arrived in greater numbers since the opening of new routes to the Nabire airport.</seg>
<seg id="361">The few jobs in the region tend to go to the better educated and prosperous migrants.</seg>
<seg id="362">Papua rarely have capital or the necessary skills to make their own enterprises competitive.</seg>
<seg id="363">"young people are not interested in staying in the village... for there are no jobs or money," says John Gobai, head of Paniai's headquarters.</seg>
<seg id="364">Isolation keeps the eyes of the world far away from Papua.</seg>
<seg id="365">Furthermore, restrictions on reporting on international media remain tense.</seg>
<seg id="366">At the beginning of the year, French journalists Franck Escudie and Basille Longchamp were deported because of lack of coordination with related institutions from Papua, although the rare permission to film was given to them.</seg>
<seg id="367">According to Phelim Kine, the deputy Asia director of Human Rights Watch, the promises of Jokowis's campaign to raise the restrictions of reporting to promote transparency and development were not realized.</seg>
<seg id="368">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "there are new dangers for foreign journalists trying to report from Indonesia's untroubled eastern provinces of Papua and West Papua: visa refusal and a black list," "" "" "" "he said in an explanation." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="369">Lack of press control means that the international pressure on the Indonesian government is largely restricted to the immediate neighbours of Papua.</seg>
<seg id="370">In March, six Pacific states - Tonga, Nauru, Palau, Tuvalu, the Marshall Islands and the Solomon Islands - called on the UN Human Rights Council to investigate the "various and widespread violations" in Papua including Paniai shooting.</seg>
<seg id="371">The same countries have historically regarded the OPM.</seg>
<seg id="372">The spokesman of the Indonesian Foreign Ministry Arrmanatha Nasir rejected the group's allegations and said journalists in Jakarta: "in Indonesia there is still a democratic system, and there are free media so it is difficult to cover the evidence of human rights cases."</seg>
<seg id="373">Local people want more foreign governments to take note of this.</seg>
<seg id="374">When an official delegation from the Netherlands, under the direction of the human right ambassador Kees Van Baar, visited Jayapura on May 4, natives broke their silence and urged him "We want freedom," according to a source, which also participated in the meeting, but would remain anonymous.</seg>
<seg id="375">Indonesia has another presidential election in 2019 but the Papua says that they probably won't be able to vote for Jokowi again.</seg>
<seg id="376">"Jokowi is a person who has good intentions, but it is surrounded by the people involved in the Paniai shots," says Gobai, Chairman of the tribal council.</seg>
<seg id="377">He wants the Paniai people to know that the Paniai people, apart from being under the constant threat of a predatory military, are in poor educational and health services.</seg>
<seg id="378">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "Gobai is saying that the Paniai people, like other Papua, consider their voice to be a" "" "" "" "guilt" "" "" "" "that he has to pay back." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="407">A survey among passengers showed that more than 20 percent of unintentionally forbidden objects were smuggled by the US Transportation Security Administration's checkpoints, including at least 6 percent of the aircraft beckoning, while they accidentally bore forbidden blades or other items with blades.</seg>
<seg id="408">Less than 1 per cent claimed they had late discovered that they had gone wrong with guns, ammunition or explosives.</seg>
<seg id="409">The survey with more than 1,000 people - which was conducted by a jet charter service, the Stratos Jet Charters Inc., also stated that younger travellers rather disregard the rules.</seg>
<seg id="410">The respondents who admitted that they were knowingly trying to fly with something that was forbidden by the TSA were 19.7 percent millennials compared to less than 15 percent, the members of Generation X.</seg>
<seg id="411">The most common objects that were intentionally passed by TSA agents were food and liquids.</seg>
<seg id="412">More than 3 percent agreed to have knowingly carried objects with blades through security control, while 2.2 percent of female respondents and 3.7 percent of the male respondents confirmed that they had intentionally brought illegal drugs into the plane.</seg>
<seg id="413">The company said that it questioned travellers all over the country to find out how many mistakenly sent smuggled goods through airport security and how many had done it intentionally.</seg>
<seg id="414">It is no surprise that people who are most likely smuggling - knowingly or unknowingly - wear safety, those who are most frequently flying.</seg>
<seg id="415">The company, however, points out that the TSA guidelines are a bit complicated and confusing.</seg>
<seg id="416">People are often unsure which liquids they are allowed to take with or how much of them.</seg>

<seg id="439">EPA manager Pruitt repulls due to the delay of the Obama-Era rules to reduce emissions</seg>
<seg id="440">One day after having been accused by 15 states, Scott Pruitt, the chief of the environmental protection authority, took his earlier decision to delay the implementation of the Obama era rules in order to reduce emissions smog causing pollutants.</seg>
<seg id="441">Pruitt presented the change as his agency turned out to be responsive to the needs of state-of-the-art environmental authorities more responsive than previous administrations.</seg>
<seg id="442">He did not mention the complaint filed against his previous position in a Federal Court of Appeal.</seg>
<seg id="443">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "it is a term that ran for states on 1 October to comply with the 2015 standards for bottomless ozone." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="444">Pruitt announced in June that he would delay adherence to a year in order to give his authority more time to study the plan and to avoid interfering with local decisions or to impede economic growth. "</seg>
<seg id="445">Pruitt, who before being appointed by President Donald Trump Attorney General of Oklahoma, was a reliable opponent of stricter environmental protection regulations for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="446">Since its arrival in Washington, Pruitt has repeatedly passed over to block or delay regulations, which oppose the chemical industry and the industry of fossil fuels.</seg>
<seg id="447">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "the sudden reversal of Wednesday is the latest legal setback for the Prudential Rollback Agenda." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="448">Last month, a Federal Employment Court in Washington decided that the EPA administrator exceeded his authority when he tried to delay the implementation of a rule of the Obama administration that obliged oil and gas companies to monitor and reduce methane leakage.</seg>
<seg id="449">In an opinion published on Wednesday evening, Pruitt suggested that his reversal at ozone standards was simply the willingness of the EPO to cooperate with States through the complex process of timely fulfillment of the new standards.</seg>
<seg id="450">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "under previous administrations, the EPA has often failed to comply with deadlines and then wait to be charged by activist groups and others," "" "" "" "said Pruitt, who complained the EPA for more than a dozen times in his previous job." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="452">"" "" "" "we also take the law and the authority we give." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="453">However, the EPA comments that Pruitt will eventually use his "authority to delay and all other legally available powers" to ensure that the rules are based on a solid policy and the best available information. "</seg>
<seg id="454">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "Republicans in Congress are pushing for a more comprehensive collection of ozone rules." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="455">A law approved last month is intended to delay the implementation of the 2015 rules by at least eight years.</seg>
<seg id="456">The measure has not yet been set up in the Senate.</seg>
<seg id="457">The New York General Attorney Eric Schneiderman, who led the coalition of states that the EPA announced this week, said the group intends to maintain the legal pressure.</seg>
<seg id="458">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "the reversal of EPA - according to our complaints - is an important gain for health and safety of these 6.7 million New Yorkers and the more than 115 million Americans who are directly affected by the smog that flows into their communities," said Schneiderman.</seg>

<seg id="465">Tumors celebrates 750 years of St. Hilarius Church</seg>
<seg id="466">750 years of St. Hilarius Church: on the occasion of the anniversary of the Bergkirche the old cemetery area in Tumlingen will be invited to a Serenade on Sunday, 16 July.</seg>
<seg id="467">Whether its idyllic location and beautiful views of the village, the historic St. Hilarius facility is a popular place to stay.</seg>
<seg id="468">Visitors of the sixth benefit-serenade can be enchanted by this powerful place.</seg>
<seg id="469">The rescue and preservation of the oldest building in the village have made the friends and supporter Tumarc their concern.</seg>
<seg id="470">Walter Martini stresses: "it is a unique village gem."</seg>
<seg id="471">In 1267 the St. Hilary Chapel was first mentioned in the Württembergischer Urcustomised Book: count Hermann von Sulz "sold the mountain with the parish church to Tumski and the" Vogtei "at Magister Eberhard von Horb and his brother Dietrich for 20 Mark silver.</seg>
<seg id="472">According to the wording of the certificate, on the Tumlinger Berg, besides the former parish church, there was also a beautiful courtyard, which belonged to the church or the patron and not the other way round.</seg>
<seg id="473">So there were people there.</seg>
<seg id="474">As described in the description of the Oberamtes Freudenstadt from 1858, beside the Unterdorf and the upper village, which are still visible today in the outskirts of Tumski, the "mountain" is the third, the beautiful settlement nucleus of the village.</seg>
<seg id="475">Old maps from the time around 1600 substantiate these historical circumstances.</seg>
<seg id="476">The right of patronage arose from the early medieval church law.</seg>
<seg id="477">A gentleman who built a church and occupied with a priest remained the owner of this church and could also inherit this church.</seg>
<seg id="478">Associated with this was the right to use a priest or to propose a new priest to the bishop.</seg>
<seg id="479">There were three altars in the church and two bells on the tower.</seg>
<seg id="480">The Greatest of the two departs at Christmas 1673.</seg>
<seg id="481">The newly created bell sounded for the first time in 1692, but had to be delivered later in the Second World War in 1942.</seg>
<seg id="482">In the Thirty Years' War (1616-1648) the window panes were inserted and the bells were stolen.</seg>
<seg id="483">The roof was leaky.</seg>
<seg id="484">In 1796 French troops camped near the church.</seg>
<seg id="485">They broke out the pulpit and church chairs and used them as firewood.</seg>
<seg id="486">The remains of the church threatened to collapse in 1809.</seg>
<seg id="487">Until 1869 the Tumlinger Hilarius cemetery served as the last resting place for the dead from auditors.</seg>
<seg id="488">In 1823 the cemetery was enlarged and the church was demolished.</seg>
<seg id="489">Only the church tower was stopped.</seg>
<seg id="490">During the New Year's Eve in 1834 a storm broke the church tower and half collapsed.</seg>
<seg id="491">To prevent misfortune, the tower was demolished.</seg>
<seg id="492">Only the tower still existing today was preserved as a witness of the 750 years old church history.</seg>
<seg id="493">Today Horst Kallenberger and Rolf-Dieter Wasn are cultivating the Hilarius system from the "Schaffner pensioners" as the successor of Dieter Dockhorn.</seg>
<seg id="494">As organisers, the friends and promoter Tumarc invite the sixth Serenade to the old cemetery to the St. Hilary Chapel on Sunday, 16 July.</seg>
<seg id="495">It is designed by the Combo of the Freudenstadt-Gymnasium and with contributions from Kurt Kübler and Reinhold Matteis.</seg>
<seg id="496">Hartmut Romann, the local leader, speaks the final word.</seg>
<seg id="497">The program starts at 4.30 p.m.</seg>
<seg id="498">Admission is from 3.30 pm.</seg>
<seg id="499">At the end of the Serenade a drink takes place in front of the cemetery.</seg>
<seg id="500">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "enjoy a summer evening under the shade of old trees and with the wide view over meadows to the forest," "" "" "" "the organizers present the fantastic view." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="501">The Serenade takes place only in dry weather.</seg>
<seg id="502">The organizers are hoping for many supporters for the preservation of the historic St. Hilarius plant, which is of importance for tumors and hearing welders.</seg>
<seg id="503">The friends and supporters of the Tumarc are particularly committed to the home care, like Serenade organiser Walter Martini reaffirmed.</seg>
<seg id="504">Association wants to check approval of wind turbines</seg>
<seg id="505">"Boisheim conducts himself" does not see a legal requirement for the construction and therefore has turned to the councillor.</seg>
<seg id="506">The "Boisheim wears" association called on Landcouncil Andreas Coenen (CDU) to take back his approval for the construction of planned wind turbines in the Boisheim Nette.</seg>
<seg id="507">It is unlawful.</seg>
<seg id="508">The association argues that at the time of approval on 30 December 2016, no wind turbines could have been approved at the Boisheimer Nette, as at the time in Viersen there existed only at the border to Schwalmtal a wind force concentration zone.</seg>
<seg id="509">Within this concentration zone, the construction and operation of wind turbines is generally possible, but at the same time the concentration zone causes the elimination of the use of wind energy for the rest of the city.</seg>
<seg id="510">Such zones are intended to prevent a "recess" of the landscape.</seg>
<seg id="511">The city of Viersen had decided on a second wind turbine concentration zone in the Boisheimer Nette a few days earlier, but it did not approve the district government of Düsseldorf because of a deformation error.</seg>
<seg id="512">"according to Christoph Erkens, president of Boisheim," the lack of planning permission is still unlawful and therefore also to take back, "said Christoph Erkens.</seg>
<seg id="513">State of affairs: the City Council once again decided on the wind concentration zone in the Boisheimer nette in front of the summer break; a permit from the district government is still pending.</seg>
<seg id="514">Erkens: "at this point, the issuance of a permit for the establishment of wind turbines is legally excluded."</seg>
<seg id="515">The circle confirms the entrance of the invitation.</seg>
<seg id="516">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "the relevant letter has been received by Viersen since last week," "" "" "" "said a spokesman." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="517">The circle takes them to the occasion to re-examine the matter.</seg>
<seg id="518">However, they do not expect the procedure to be stopped.</seg>
<seg id="519">In view of ongoing proceedings at the Administrative Court, the circle on Thursday did not want to comment on the arguments of the association Boisheim.</seg>
<seg id="520">The NEW Re, a subsidiary of the NEW, plans to build four 200-metre-high wind turbines on an area at the Boisheimer Nette.</seg>
<seg id="521">Last year, the company, in which the city Viersen is indirectly involved, closed lease contracts with the owner of about 65 hectares of land.</seg>
<seg id="522">With the construction of the four wind turbines, the electricity demand should be covered by around 11 400 households - this corresponds to about one fifth of the electricity needs of all four-legged households.</seg>
<seg id="523">The NEW Re wants to invest some 20 million euros.</seg>
<seg id="524">Last summer, Viersen City Council gave the green light to the purchase of three wind turbines in the Linnich wind park near Aachen as well as a participation in a wind power plant in Übach-Palenberg in the district Heinsberg.</seg>

<seg id="532">Bad Langensalaer and people from the region are to rediscover shopping in the city centre in September.</seg>
<seg id="533">The business association and the city administration want to take advantage of the weekend on September 8 and 9 in order to entice the inhabitants to the shopping malls in the city centre.</seg>
<seg id="534">As the chairman of the commercial association, Christian König, announced, the "home shopping" weekend will make customers aware of what offers their own city is located away from the usual supermarket merchandise.</seg>
<seg id="535">Accordingly, a market with regional companies is planned, similar to the weekly market.</seg>
<seg id="536">In addition, local firms should present themselves with their training places.</seg>
<seg id="537">In addition, the shops of the city centre are to invite "Mitternights-Shoppure."</seg>
<seg id="538">The campaign aims not only to residents of the city and the region.</seg>
<seg id="539">In preparation are commercials on the radio, an internet video and printed bags that point to the action weekend, so Christian König.</seg>
<seg id="540">The municipal administration and the commercial association cooperate with the Chamber of Commerce and Industry.</seg>
<seg id="541">Thus the commercial association and the city go to another stage of the project "Attractive downtown."</seg>
<seg id="542">These include new offerings such as the first "active day" to the well-known well and selling Sunday, talks with all the tradesmen and hosts, in order to move them to active participation.</seg>
<seg id="543">Attractive offers on Saturday and the waiver of parking fees on that day are part of the concept.</seg>
<seg id="544">In addition, customer potentials are to be re-opened or re-opened.</seg>
<seg id="545">These include spa guests and tourists.</seg>
<seg id="546">But also many locals would have lost the city center while shopping.</seg>
<seg id="547">In the end, everyone would have to contribute to liven the city centre - to landlords, the factories of the whole city and clubs.</seg>

<seg id="564">Telephone calls between US President Donald Trump and leaders of Mexico and Australia were published by the Washington Post.</seg>
<seg id="565">On 27 January, Trump requested to stop in a telephone conversation with Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto, to publicly say that he would not pay for a planned boundary wall.</seg>
<seg id="566">The US president appealed to him because he had publicly denounced the wall. according to reports, he said to him, "You can't tell the press."</seg>

<seg id="568">The transcripts of his first call with the Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull have also been published and revealed a tense exchange.</seg>
<seg id="569">Mr. Trump told Mr. Turnbull that a trade for the US would be "laughable," "bad" and "stupid" and that the existence on the trade that was imparted by the Obama administration would look like a "Depp" after he had proposed a ban on the relocation of refugees to the United States.</seg>

<seg id="590">According to FBI files received by the NBC News, more than 50 men from Monroe and the surrounding counties were suspected in the lynching process.</seg>
<seg id="591">But no one was ever accused.</seg>
<seg id="592">Although the suspects remain free on foot for decades, civil rights activists say that the double motivation for the Lynch actions throughout the city was always known: politics and sex.</seg>
<seg id="593">In April 1946, a decision by the Supreme Court of Justice in Georgia enabled the black citizens in Georgia to vote for their vote for the first time in the summer.</seg>

<seg id="604">For almost a decade, Cassandra Greene has conducted the annual installment of the Moore Ford Bridge Lynch-Morde.</seg>
<seg id="605">Her presentation is illustrative, poignant and is based on a kind of deep racism, many of whom want to believe that he no longer exists in America.</seg>
<seg id="606">It is hard to watch, and more difficult to look away, but Greene said that this is the point.</seg>
<seg id="607">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "we don't want to talk about the Lynch because we are confronted with the ugliness in all of us," "" "" "" "she said." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="609">Rehearsals for this year's production began in June, and on the first day almost 30 actors - a dozen whites and the rest of the black - pushed into a room and listened as Greene started a well-rehearsed view of the piece.</seg>
<seg id="610">Wade Marbaugh is a co-director here.</seg>
<seg id="611">He has played the role of chief-member member for years, but he said that the role will never be easier.</seg>

<seg id="614">On the other side of the room, actors Darrius Bradshaw and Nick Rascona, who play Roger Malcom and Barnett Hester, rehearsed their lines.</seg>
<seg id="615">The piece begins with Malcom, who screams Hester and pushes him out, furiously that he slept with his wife Dorothy.</seg>
<seg id="616">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "I said," "" "" "" "he, swept away from my property!" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="617">The fire is reciprocated by Rascona.</seg>
<seg id="618">There is a break.</seg>
<seg id="619">And then everyone (at least all black actors) breaks out in laughter.</seg>
<seg id="620">Greene laughs at the loudest.</seg>
<seg id="621">"what?!," said Rascona.</seg>
<seg id="622">He is alarmed and confused.</seg>
<seg id="623">Was I too hard?</seg>

<seg id="629">Everyone is busy getting this right, not only because of the game, but also because of the memory of the four killed people.</seg>
<seg id="630">The scene starts again.</seg>
<seg id="631">This time when Ancona is saying the N word, he says it sharply and with imprint.</seg>
<seg id="632">Absolutely nobody laughs.</seg>
<seg id="633">This repetition ends violent and fast.</seg>
<seg id="634">There are screams, shots and then silence.</seg>
<seg id="635">A woman, dressed in mourning, stands above the corpses of the actors and performs Billie holidays mourning praises "Strange Fruit."</seg>
<seg id="636">Her voice breaks with every second word.</seg>
<seg id="637">About a hundred meters behind it caught a group of about four dozen spectators sweat and tears from the eyes.</seg>
<seg id="638">The audience is almost uniformly divided between black and white.</seg>
<seg id="639">One pair came from Ithaca, New York, to see the performance, many come down only the street.</seg>
<seg id="640">They have experienced Georgy's oppressive moisture for almost eight hours when Brooks leads them on a pilgrimage to the burial places of the Malcoms and Dorseys.</seg>
<seg id="641">Up to this point the killings have remained an anecdote, but now, if one stands in the same country where the Lynch morde took place, the air feels spooky.</seg>
<seg id="642">When the last notes of the song sound, Greene is inviting the crowd to come closer and inspect the body's name.</seg>
<seg id="643">Children sit on their heads, register the fake blood and the silent bodies and whisper each other.</seg>

<seg id="645">After a few minutes Greene owes the crowd - and suddenly it's over.</seg>
<seg id="646">The actors throw away the lynch and wipe their tears off.</seg>
<seg id="647">Bradshaw hugs Marbaugh, the man in the suit, who played the member of the clan.</seg>
<seg id="648">Nick Rascona embraces two of his fellow players and then breaks down in her arms, the emotional burden of the performance finally breaks with him.</seg>

<seg id="684">Crowd: usually in stone in the furniture market, once a week I am working here in Greven in the furniture bridge.</seg>
<seg id="685">And I worked at school already in the open day.</seg>
<seg id="686">What are your experiences with it?</seg>
<seg id="687">Quantity: it's a nice, wide spectrum I see here.</seg>
<seg id="688">I have to do with different people, with young people, with refugees, with young adults.</seg>
<seg id="689">They are 26 years old, so a late-time volunteer.</seg>

<seg id="698">I will start my studies in social services during the winter semester.</seg>

<seg id="883">New results of Swedish asylum application tests published</seg>
<seg id="884">The latest results of tests for asylum seekers in Sweden, which have undergone a new method for medical assessment of their age, show that more than 80 percent of the tested persons are older than 18 years. however, not everyone believes in the accuracy of these results.</seg>
<seg id="885">The Swedish authorities for Forensic Medicine (Rättsmedicinalverket) started the tests last year.</seg>
<seg id="886">During the asylum procedure, they should take a closer look at the assessment of age after the Swedish Migration Department (Migration Panel) has been criticised for errors in assessing the correct age of some refugees who were minor.</seg>
<seg id="887">Up to now, migration sales have sent 6,880 cases to test and the Forensic Medicine Agency has now published the results of a total of 2,481 tests from mid-March to 31 July 2017.</seg>
<seg id="888">Eighty percent (2002) were assessed as 18 or older, while in further 25 cases the Forensic Medicine Agency assessed that the person was "possibly 18 years or older."</seg>
<seg id="889">"" "" "" "in 432 cases, the conclusion was that the person" "" "" "" "may be under 18 years old." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="890">The tests are conducted only in cases where the age of the person is questioned.</seg>
<seg id="891">According to Johan Göransson from the Forensic Medicine Agency, the results have been stable over the past few months.</seg>
<seg id="892">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "we see no big difference in the statistics of the past months, the figures are fairly constant," "" "" "" "he said the magazine" "" "" "" "The Local." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="893">The high proportion of cases in which the person has been judged for over 18 years does not necessarily mean that the asylum seeker has lied about his age.</seg>
<seg id="894">In May, the agency published the results of 581 tests and said that there are 442 cases that "suggest that the person under investigation is 18 years or older."</seg>
<seg id="895">When the paper Svenska Dagbladet investigated the 581 results published she found out that in 243 of these cases the person had openly said that she will be 18 years old this year.</seg>
<seg id="896">The method of medical retirement assessment, in which X-ray images of wisdom teeth and MRI images are made of knee joints, which are then analyzed by dentists and radiologists, has also been criticised in some areas.</seg>
<seg id="897">A sceptic is the endocrinologist Claude Marcus des Karolinska-Institut, whose work involves the assessment of the biological maturity of humans, to see if sooner or later they usually went through puberty.</seg>
<seg id="898">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "I had reason to think about it and I don't think that the type of measurement should be used." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="899">Judging the biological age in this way is very unsafe.</seg>
<seg id="900">"" "" "" "if we cannot say it, we should not do as if we could," "" "" "" "he said the newspaper Metro." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="901">However, Göransson of the Forensic Medicine Agency has defended the accuracy of the tests: "in general, you can say that the risk of a child as an adult is low.</seg>
<seg id="902">"" "" "" "the greatest risk is when the person is under 18, in this case, this is about 10 percent." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="903">Fully in the plan</seg>
<seg id="904">The work on the three bridges of the highway 108 between Lauterbach and Schramberg progresses well.</seg>
<seg id="905">On Wednesday, a seven ton concrete part was installed at the bridge at the eastern entrance of Lauterbach.</seg>
<seg id="906">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "we are very good at the time, it's going to be great," "" "" "" "says Reinhold Leicht, Head of Civil Engineering and Transport at the governing presidency of Freiburg." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="907">In April, the work began at the same time as the bridges between Schramberg and Lauterbach.</seg>
<seg id="908">The building end is scheduled for October and Light is sure that the schedule will be respected.</seg>
<seg id="909">The first bridge, coming from Schramberg, leads across the Trombach.</seg>
<seg id="910">It is a concrete arch bridge made of concrete, which is clad with red Buntsandstein and has a total length of 4.80 metres.</seg>
<seg id="911">It was built in 1900.</seg>
<seg id="912">Like the two other bridges, it has now come into the years.</seg>
<seg id="913">In order to ensure stability and road safety, the three buildings are now thoroughly rehabilitated.</seg>
<seg id="914">The two other bridges lead over the Lauterbach.</seg>
<seg id="915">They are made of red Buntsandstein.</seg>
<seg id="916">Both were built in 1939 and are twelve, respectively 10,60 metres long.</seg>
<seg id="917">The bridge at the entrance to Lauterbach has now received a 1.30 metre wide and seven tons of heavy so-called bridge cap on Wednesday morning.</seg>
<seg id="918">This is an edge fixing which is also used as an operating lane.</seg>
<seg id="919">On Friday a 2.20 metre wide bridge cap is to be used on the southern part of the bridge.</seg>
<seg id="920">Then the pedestrian walkway is to proceed.</seg>
<seg id="921">The special thing about it is that it is finished parts, a patent of the Schramberger company Dizwo.</seg>
<seg id="922">The other two bridges are already equipped with the patented bridge caps.</seg>
<seg id="923">Special fingertip feeling has required the laying of lines through the building in Lauterbach.</seg>
<seg id="924">There is also a fibre-optic cable to which many companies are connected.</seg>
<seg id="925">The local residents were informed about the project in advance of the work.</seg>
<seg id="926">Fish and crayfish first had to be fished.</seg>
<seg id="927">For the bridges between the building yard and the collecting point towards Schramberg, traffic is regulated by a traffic light.</seg>
<seg id="928">The road in the area of the bridge at the height of the Hotel "Tannenhof" and "Sieben Linden" is completely closed for construction work on the bridge at the Lauterbach entrance.</seg>
<seg id="929">The costs for the three bridge claims amount to a total of 700,000 euros.</seg>
<seg id="930">The whole thing is financed by the country.</seg>

<seg id="932">It is not so common that parties go on a strand, but when it comes to the alternative for Germany (AfD) comes together, which is otherwise difficult to put under a hat.</seg>
<seg id="933">The parties represented in the Kreistag group of Vulkaneifel (CDU, SPD, Green, FDP, FWG, Linke) belong to a broad alliance that shows peacefully this day, because the AfD invites in the Gerolsteiner Stadthalle Rondell to the "big campaign launch" according to the poster.</seg>

<seg id="938">A colourful picture that offers itself.</seg>
<seg id="939">And what Christa Karoli, chair of the Forums One World and one of the leading organisers, is delighted: "great how many people have come together here."</seg>

<seg id="943">Mario Hompes from the AfD vulcanic Eifel reports that he tried such an event and got the supplement.</seg>

<seg id="948">Around 200 listeners are waiting in the hall to wait for the nominee candidate for the Bundestag election, Alice Weidel, and the deputy chairman of the Federal President, Beatrix of Storch.</seg>
<seg id="949">The police presence remains unchanged, but until now the officials had a quiet evening.</seg>
<seg id="950">A little more than an hour the AfD event takes place, the guests on the forecourt have a longer breath, but also there is announced shortly after 21 o'clock.</seg>
<seg id="951">The police can come back - no special incidents.</seg>

<seg id="1092">Mr Schmidt, how can consumers protect themselves from toxic eggs?</seg>
<seg id="1093">I can only encourage all consumers to view the eggs in your fridge and check the stamp on the stamp.</seg>
<seg id="1094">The federal states present the latest information about the affected eggs-batches on the consumer protection portal www.foodservicnung.de.</seg>
<seg id="1095">Affected eggs should be destroyed or returned.</seg>
<seg id="1096">Even if after all that we know at this time, health hazards are practically excluded.</seg>
<seg id="1097">Does Aldi now assume the best possible crisis response - all eggs out of the offer - because the central role of the enlightener is not really perceived by the Federal Minister of Agriculture?</seg>
<seg id="1098">Food monitoring is the task of the federal states.</seg>
<seg id="1099">Nevertheless, my house has opened immediately and has been in close contact with the authorities of the countries since the announcement of the consternation of Germany.</seg>
<seg id="1100">All information and risk assessment are available to consumers.</seg>
<seg id="1101">Just like the manufacturers, trade has to ensure that the products sold are marketable and harmless to health.</seg>
<seg id="1102">If the residual sugar level of 0.005 mg / kg is exceeded with eggs, these are not accessible.</seg>
<seg id="1103">Unloaded eggs can, however, be sold and consumed.</seg>
<seg id="1104">This time, the factories are not to blame.</seg>
<seg id="1105">Do Production Processes and Consumers sit in the same boat?</seg>
<seg id="1106">According to the present state of knowledge, the production facilities do not meet any immediate fault.</seg>
<seg id="1107">On the contrary, they have to expect economic damage due to the presumed illegal practices of service companies.</seg>
<seg id="1108">As always, there is too little control in the case of an emergency.</seg>
<seg id="1109">Is there only a lack of personal or coherent responsibility?</seg>
<seg id="1110">It was just the official controls that have revealed the process.</seg>
<seg id="1111">The truth is, however, that food fraud and criminal energy can never be ruled out by 100 percent.</seg>
<seg id="1112">It is precisely for this reason that a consistent enlightenment of such events and the transfer to the prosecutors in the cases in which criminal offences can be present are of decisive importance.</seg>
<seg id="1113">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "I have already made it clear that I expect a complete enlightenment from the responsible authorities." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1114">Is regular alermism really necessary for food scandals?</seg>
<seg id="1115">Consumers "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "consumers have the right to only get safe and marketable food." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1116">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "if an unauthorised insecticide is used in the food industry, consumers" "" "" "" "are rightly indignant." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1117">The paned means manufacturers, retailers and consumers get into a situation which is absolutely not necessary.</seg>
<seg id="1118">In principle, it must be clear that the unlawful use of the insecticide Fipronil in the attitude of food-delivering animals is unacceptable and must be terminated immediately.</seg>
<seg id="1119">This must be done consistently and with high pressure on all levels.</seg>
<seg id="1120">I expect from all the competent authorities that the facts are quickly and completely enlightened.</seg>
<seg id="1121">How to impact football on Neymars move to Paris</seg>
<seg id="1122">The rules that aim to prevent unimpeded expenditures of European football clubs will not disturb Neymars world record transfer from Spain to French Paris-Saint Germain.</seg>
<seg id="1123">Any consequences will come for Paris Saint-Germain of UEFA, as the leading organization that oversees the European game has the power to prohibit teams from entering the prestigious champions league tournament.</seg>
<seg id="1124">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "financial Fair Play rules launched in 2011 by UEFA means that PSG will eventually prove that the transfer of Neymar was financed without major losses." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1125">Barcelona has paid 222 million euros (262 million dollars) to purchase the Brazilian from its contract, and Neymar receives a salary that will amount to tens of millions of dollars a year.</seg>
<seg id="1126">Here are some of the financial aspects of Neymars move to France.</seg>
<seg id="1127">PSG can certainly make money loose in order to sign Neymar and bring him to a galaxy of other stars, in view of the financing of the team by the generous ruling family of Qatar.</seg>
<seg id="1128">Clubs are allowed to spend a lot of money for the purchase of players, but must counter with legitimate income sources enabling them to break the break even point in their activities related to football.</seg>
<seg id="1129">FFP was designed by Michel Platini after his election to the UEFA President in 2007.</seg>
<seg id="1130">The former French player believed that associations who had taken enormous debt in their quest for success effectively deceive and risked to ruin themselves when banks or owners withdrew their support.</seg>
<seg id="1131">In 2011, FFP shifted from concentration to the debt of clubs on the monitoring of their losses.</seg>
<seg id="1132">The change meant that the business model that Roman Abramovich originally used in Chelsea in 2003 - bought a club with potential and then invested strongly to improve the team and build a global brand - becoming a harder matter.</seg>
<seg id="1133">During the current three-year period of FFP, which runs until 2018, clubs can accept losses of EUR 30 million.</seg>
<seg id="1134">And even though Platini has fallen from the presidency in 2015, his successor, Aleksander Ceferin, will continue to scare away from excessive spending.</seg>
<seg id="1135">"surely FFP is not dead and we will certainly reinforce the rules for the future," said Andrea Traverso, who is responsible for FFP for the UEFA, compared to The Associated Press last week.</seg>
<seg id="1136">Although the PSG has paid the buy-out clause of Neymar in a flat rate, it can distribute the amount for the billing over the duration of its contract.</seg>
<seg id="1137">Neymar has signed a five-year contract so that the redemption rate for the next five years can be expelled in the amount of 44.4 million euros in the annual financial statements.</seg>
<seg id="1138">The first wave of FFP sanctions in 2014 brought the PSG together with Abu Dhabi, which is owned by Manchester City, with the toughest sanctions.</seg>
<seg id="1139">The PSG received a fine of €60 million (at that time 82 million dollars), which later reduced to 20 million euros - and it was ordered that the team members for the Champions League of the 2014 / 15 season will be limited to 21 players instead of the usual 25 players.</seg>
<seg id="1140">The UEFA is looking for clubs that could try to outwit their financial supervision by inflating their revenues by companies associated with the owners of a club.</seg>
<seg id="1141">While a Catalonian company could sponsor the PSG if the value of sponsorship should exceed the standard market rates, the UEFA would not be regarded as legitimate income.</seg>
<seg id="1142">This was exactly what happened in 2014 when the UEFA decided that the sponsorship of the PSA was inflated by the Qatar Tourism Authority.</seg>
<seg id="1143">It was reported that part of PSG payments to Neymar could come about payments from the Organizing Committee of the 2022 World Cup in Qatar.</seg>
<seg id="1144">But PSG and Qatar 2022 have argued that Neymar World Cup ambassadors are going to be and such a manoeuvre for the UEFA regulators could be easy to find out.</seg>
<seg id="1145">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "the sanctions against PSG mean that UEFA will be even more attentive to ignore any attempt to circumvent the rules." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1146">The UEFA had no preparatory talks with PSG about Neymars Transfer, said on Thursday the people who are familiar with the situation.</seg>
<seg id="1147">They spoke under the condition of anonymity with The Associated Press, because they were not authorised to discuss the PSG situation.</seg>
<seg id="1148">The latest published reports show that PSG 2015 / 16 with a turnover of 542.4 million euros has achieved a profit of more than 10 million euros.</seg>
<seg id="1149">The accounts for the last financial year must still be published.</seg>
<seg id="1150">PSG expects Neymars arrive a blessing for sponsoring deals, merchandising and trim sales.</seg>
<seg id="1151">The association assumes that sales will rise by at least 30 percent after signing the contract.</seg>
<seg id="1152">The Spanish League was clearly irritated to see one of the best football players, and they tried to prevent Neymars away by claiming that PSG would violate the FFP.</seg>
<seg id="1153">"it is a clear case of" financial doping "with the club and the state," said the President of the La League, Javier Tebas, the Spanish daily AS with regard to Qatar's final ownership of PSG.</seg>
<seg id="1154">Arsenal-Manager Arsene Wenger, whose association is owned by an American sports tycoon, shares the reservations of La League against a state funded by an association.</seg>

<seg id="1158">Swiss is looking for a new chocolate supplier</seg>
<seg id="1159">Chocolate Frey Board Chocolate has produced chocolate for Swiss Life in recent years.</seg>
<seg id="1160">Now the sweet co-operation is in front of a possible end: the airline will rewrite the order.</seg>
<seg id="1161">On request by the news agency SDA, Swiss-speaking spokesperson Meike Fuhlrott confirmed a corresponding report from the newspaper "Northern Switzerland" on Friday.</seg>
<seg id="1162">According to current planning, the airline will conclude a new contract in the first half of 2018.</seg>
<seg id="1163">The products were reviewed every two to three years and subjected to quality control.</seg>
<seg id="1164">"we are very satisfied with the current supplier Chocolat Frey," said the spokeswoman.</seg>
<seg id="1165">Around 17 million small red-white printed shocks are distributed to 14 grams per year before landing at the passengers.</seg>
<seg id="1166">Swiss does not want to provide information about the cost.</seg>
<seg id="1167">Industry insiders estimate the order volume according to "Northwest Switzerland" to 1.5 to 2 million Swiss francs - the Migros subsidiary achieves an annual turnover of about 1 billion Swiss francs.</seg>
<seg id="1168">But what is more important is the advertising effect: it is a prestigious order for a chocolate manufacturer.</seg>
<seg id="1169">Swiss does not want to betray how many applicants there is a new tender.</seg>
<seg id="1170">But there are only Swiss manufacturers who come into question.</seg>
<seg id="1171">According to the newspaper report, Chocolat Frey wants to seek a renewal of the Treaty on Spring 2018.</seg>
<seg id="1172">For the SDA, the largest Swiss chocolate manufacturer was not reachable for an opinion.</seg>
<seg id="1173">Swiss chocolates distribute the chocolate boards on board their flights since 2006.</seg>
<seg id="1174">Barry Callebaut has supplied chocolate tablets in collaboration with Hug before the Swiss contract with the Migros subsidiary.</seg>
<seg id="1175">Two and a half years ago Swiss Life made the possibility of placing the logo at the start of the cooperation with Chocolat Frey.</seg>
<seg id="1176">The airline collaborates with various Swiss chocolate producers.</seg>
<seg id="1177">On long haul flights the customers of the First Class with treats from Confiserie Sprüngli are spoiled, in the Business Class passengers Schoggi von Lindt and in Economy Class Schoggi by Chocolat Frey.</seg>
<seg id="1178">Swiss Schoggi also distributes chocolate from Chocolate Frey, both in Business and Economy Class.</seg>

<seg id="1181">His brother Christoph, Olympic Champion from 2016, had failed in the national World Cup elimination and could only look at the discus competition from the tribune.</seg>
<seg id="1182">Also with the first attempt, the Polish title defender Piotr Malachowski, who threw 65,13 metres wide, qualified for the final battle.</seg>
<seg id="1183">Nostalgia goes into "Wet Hot American Summer" and "Comrade Detective" into the niche</seg>
<seg id="1184">This repetition of history is nostalgic at the same time because of the glorious days of the characters of the 80 "s, for the 90-year Grunge era (as the thinker David Wain and Michael Showalter the Sketch comedy" The State "for MTV), and for themselves - that is, for 2001, before their stars, such as Elizabeth Banks, Amy Poehler and Paul Rudd went to bigger things.</seg>
<seg id="1185">As a cultural artifact, it is equally a parody and embodiment of our Facebook-capable era of permanent memories.</seg>
<seg id="1186">But as franchise it feels like the time is scarce.</seg>
<seg id="1187">"first Day of Camp" worked surprisingly well, not only because of its absurd humour (it contained an original story for a talking can of vegetables spoken by H. Jon Benjamin).</seg>
<seg id="1188">Casting herself on the core of the gag - actors of middle ages play horny children who are grown up - nevertheless they managed the impossibility to regain the last part of the weather.</seg>
<seg id="1189">"ten Years Later," with his adults, who now play adults, is less emotionally rooted and his parody goes more after the foundry principle, including a riff on the Stalker films of the 90 "s like" The Hand That Rocks the Cradle "(" The hand that shakes the cradle ").</seg>
<seg id="1190">At one point, a character sticks through an Apple-Powerbook, some inline skates and "a number of other things dating back to 1991."</seg>
<seg id="1191">Many of the central stories are the same.</seg>
<seg id="1192">The gracious Coop (Mr. Show alter), now Romautor, has still not forgotten Katie (Marguerite Moreau).</seg>
<seg id="1193">Victor (Ken Marino) has not lost its virginity.</seg>
<seg id="1194">And there is another mad-evil plot, included in the Ronald Reagan (also Mr. Showalter), who is now supported by George H. W. Bush (a well-successful impression of Michael Ian Black).</seg>
<seg id="1195">As always, the courses are the best part of franchise.</seg>
<seg id="1196">It is a lot of fun to see the eternally young Mr. Rudd, who shows Matt Dillons Mustache of "Singles," whose former Big-Man-on-Camp Andy feels like an old cracker.</seg>
<seg id="1197">These are the moments of accidental madness that could heat up this franchise as a kind of repetitive "Seven Up!" series until he reaches that which I consider as his logical conclusion: "Wet Hot American Summer: Twenty Years Later," whose final scene will show the band as they will visit the movie premiere of "Wet Hot American Summer."</seg>
<seg id="1198">"Comrade Detective" on Amazon now recalls some other kind of nostalgia: the revival of the Cold War of "The Americans," the film "Atomic Blonde," and even "GLOW" with its east-west-west ring combat iconography.</seg>
<seg id="1199">The comedy created by Brian Gatewood and Alessandro Tanaka is to be a found TV series: a Romanian drama of the eighties with the two policemen as friends, two officers from Bucharest who fight for truth, atheism and the way of Marxism-Leninism.</seg>
<seg id="1200">The main roles - a hard-boiled Gregor and an idealistic Iosef - are played by Florin Piersic Jr. and Corneliu ulici, whose dialogues by Channing Tatum (also an executive producer) and Joseph Gordon-Levitt be dubbed in English.</seg>
<seg id="1201">It is an ingenious idea.</seg>
<seg id="1202">But it is not much more than an idea.</seg>
<seg id="1203">There are some nice flags to watch (the police confers the time to watch chess on television, as Americans might do with football).</seg>
<seg id="1204">And the list of famous speakers - including Jenny Slate, Nick Offerman, Mahershala Ali and Chloe Sevigny - provides a decent play 'Make the voice out'.</seg>
<seg id="1205">But "Comrade Detective" is so involved in the truthfulness of a desperate propaganda drama - a murderer wearing a Reagan mask is involved - that it often plays like a single one.</seg>
<seg id="1206">With six long episodes, it's gone, and the comedy is not fast or frequent enough.</seg>
<seg id="1207">"Comrade Detective," reduced to a smaller length, could better deliver its agitprop satire, since Gregor and Iosef constantly visit the American Embassy, whose lobby is always occupied by two thick men who devour a bunch of hamburgers.</seg>
<seg id="1208">The message for the imaginated communistic public is that Western culture can make everything for food for a banquet.</seg>
<seg id="1209">The fictitious Romanian creators were not wrong: we even make it with our own younger history and theirs.</seg>

<seg id="1262">Bank of England will hold interest rates at 0.25%</seg>
<seg id="1263">The Bank of England is expected to announce later that interest rates will remain unchanged after the weak economic growth and the weakening of inflation have dampened speculation over an increase.</seg>
<seg id="1264">The Bank of England warned that economic growth will remain "sluggish" when it retained the interest rates on family income in the middle of an intensified pressure.</seg>
<seg id="1265">The political decision makers of the Monetary Committee (MPC) of the Bank agreed with 6 to 2 to hold interest rates to 0.25%, with fewer members seeking an increase this month, as weak economic growth has weakened the support for an increase.</seg>
<seg id="1266">In its quarterly inflation report, the Bank reduced its growth forecasts for 2017 to 1.7% and in 2018 to 1.6%, and warned that the pressure on household income would continue, with inflation expected to rise to just under 3% in the fall.</seg>
<seg id="1267">But it signalled that interest rate would be necessary in the next few years to curb the inflation of Brexit and it said that the cost of credit might have to rise more than expected in the financial markets.</seg>
<seg id="1268">The members also voted to withdraw a portion of the Mammut business cycle, which was issued a year ago after the Brexit.</seg>
<seg id="1269">It will require time for the financing plan to provide cheaper financial resources for banks as of the coming February, although it was said that it will now be expected to provide £15 billion more in the framework of this system - with 115 billion pounds sterling.</seg>
<seg id="1270">Minutes after deciding on the interest rate, the bank said: "in the central forecast of the MPC the gross domestic product (GDP) remains weak in the short term, as pressure on the real income of households continues to burden consumption."</seg>
<seg id="1271">At the interest rates, it repeated that "a certain tightening of monetary policy" would be necessary for the cooling down of inflation and a "somewhat larger" extent than the markets expect.</seg>
<seg id="1272">The markets are currently forecasting the first increase in the third quarter of next year and another in 2020.</seg>

<seg id="1275">It maintained its growth forecast to 1.8% in 2018.</seg>
<seg id="1276">The pound declined to this news vis-à-vis the dollar and the euro.</seg>
<seg id="1277">The pound fell by 0.5% to 1.31 US dollars and fell by 0.4% to 1.11 euros.</seg>
<seg id="1278">The decision to no change comes after recent disappointing growth figures have dampened the rising expectations of an increase in interest and GDP in the second quarter rose from 0.2% in the previous three months to 0.3%.</seg>
<seg id="1279">Growth is expected to be 0.3% in the third quarter, although it will recover slightly after the Bank towards the end of the year.</seg>
<seg id="1280">The latest inflation report provided little enthusiasm for households affected by rising inflation and minor elevations, since the tightening will be even worse before it becomes better.</seg>
<seg id="1281">She added that in the next few years, monetary policy can't "prevent the coming of income," but she added that wages at the end of her three-year forecast will be "clearly" recuperated.</seg>
<seg id="1282">The economy is also boosted by the increasing demand for British goods, which is attributable to the weak Pound, which will compensate for a proportion of lower consumption expenditure.</seg>
<seg id="1283">The decision comes a year after lowering interest rates to 0.25% last August following the shocking EU vote that caused the fall of the ground.</seg>
<seg id="1284">The bank estimates that it will likely take four years to fully reach the prices and the economy.</seg>
<seg id="1285">Before the Bank's final decision on interest rates, the call for an increase in interest rose, as inflation increased the pressure on hard-pressed households, with three policymakers in July asking for an increase to 0.5%.</seg>
<seg id="1286">Inflation decreased from 2.9% in June to 2.6% in June, although the Bank said that this was expected and will attract them again in the coming months.</seg>

<seg id="1290">NHS (National Health Service) should prescribe controversial HIV drug for 10,000 people</seg>
<seg id="1291">Patients will receive access to a "transformative" HIV prevention treatment after a fight in front of the High Court against the funding of the drug in NHS.</seg>
<seg id="1292">NHS England announced that pre-intercourse preexposure prophylaxis (prep), which can reduce the risk of infection in high-risk patients by around 86 percent, is now delivered by the Health Service through a first three-year study for treasured 10,000 people.</seg>
<seg id="1293">He agreed to finance the trial after the Court of Appeal confirmed a ruling by the Supreme Court in the last year, according to which the NHS had the authority to pay for the prep in spite of the assertion that the local authorities should finance it.</seg>
<seg id="1294">The move announced on Thursday was welcomed by NHS England leader Simon Stevens as an "important new intervention," while the National Aids Trust (NAT) called it the "crucial moment."</seg>
<seg id="1295">Sexual health clinics in London, Brighton, Manchester, Liverpool, and Sheffield will be among the first to allow people to sign up and further clinics will follow in October, before it will be launched in the whole of England in April 2018.</seg>
<seg id="1296">Preexposure prophylaxis (prep) is a result of HIV preparations taken prior to sex in order to reduce the risk of HIV infection.</seg>
<seg id="1297">Studies have shown that prep significantly reduces the HIV transmission in infection-prone areas.</seg>
<seg id="1298">Prep prior to sexual intercourse means that just enough drugs are present in the body of a person to prevent an HIV infection.</seg>
<seg id="1299">Such medications can be taken every day or so already two hours prior to sexual intercourse.</seg>
<seg id="1300">Among those who are eligible for treatment include gay or bisexual men, transsexuals and individuals with HIV positive partners who have not been successfully treated.</seg>
<seg id="1301">In clinics, suitable participants are identified which agree to the study, including men, women, transgenders and individuals who have a partner whose HIV status is not known to be controlled by antiretroviral treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1302">People living in England and registered with a family doctor can also register for possible participation in their local participating sex clinic.</seg>
<seg id="1303">The program is signed £10 million and NHS England signed a contract to supply the drugs this week following an international competitive procurement.</seg>
<seg id="1304">The study aims to assess the full potential of prep by collecting clinical evidence as it is used and implemented on a large scale.</seg>
<seg id="1305">"" "" "" "Stevens said:" "" "" "" "this great new intervention should complement and overtake the far-reaching and increasingly successful efforts to prevent HIV." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1306">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "there is another milestone in the more than three decades lasting progress in addressing one of humanity's greatest health challenges." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1307">Deborah Gold, Chief Executive at NAT (National Aids Trust) said: "this is a crucial moment in the fight against HIV.</seg>
<seg id="1308">Prep, when targeting people in need and vulnerable people, provides the opportunity to change the English HIV epidemic.</seg>
<seg id="1309">From September onwards, people with high HIV risk will have access to this NHS-funded study in England to develop a new instrument that is truly individually controlled and not subject to negotiation with a partner, leading to the improvement of many lives.</seg>
<seg id="1310">We warmly welcome this announcement. "</seg>
<seg id="1311">Ian Green, Chairman of the Board of Terrence Higgins Trust, said: "the priority must now be that the study is carried out quickly across the country and that no one who has a risk for HIV will be left behind.</seg>

<seg id="1317">Living a big life: mezzanine and clever designer tricks have transformed this small Earls Court apartment into a spacious home</seg>
<seg id="1318">Joanne Leigh, a former banker with a passion for real estate, resized in 2014 from a large house in Knightsbridge to Earls Court Apartment.</seg>
<seg id="1319">It is on the first floor of an elegant Queen Anne terrace - and it is proof of the new design that Joanne has not packed and sold her bags.</seg>
<seg id="1320">"before that I lived with my ex in Knightsbridge in a much larger space," Joanne said.</seg>
<seg id="1321">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "I looked for something comparable to my price." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1322">I was shown this apartment in Earls Court, and she had the same high ceilings.</seg>
<seg id="1323">"" "" "" "I fell in love with her and made an offer on that day." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1324">Since the first visit, the 1,000 square foot has been completely overhauled.</seg>
<seg id="1325">Originally a one bedroom property with a nested layout - you had to go through the kitchen to get to the bedroom - wanted to add Joanne storage space and an intermediate floor to make optimal use of the generous ceiling height.</seg>
<seg id="1326">"I wanted high ceilings, large windows, lots of light.</seg>
<seg id="1327">That was my requirement, "she says.</seg>
<seg id="1328">For this purpose, she commissioned the architecture and design studio Duck & Shed by Erfan Azadi from Notting Hill to use 12.5 feet high ceilings and create a home that was not just a development, but also a place to live for Joanne.</seg>
<seg id="1329">The ceiling was not large enough to place two rooms on top of each other so that the architectural challenge was to create an intermediate floor in which one could stand.</seg>
<seg id="1330">Erfan had to think creatively to solve the task.</seg>
<seg id="1331">"the steel work is quite complicated," he explains.</seg>
<seg id="1332">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "we had to arrange the rooms so that they were stacked on top of each other without having to bend." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1333">It was not just about building a simple platform, but to put the steel in such a way that it had the right height for the function at the top or bottom. "</seg>
<seg id="1334">This arrangement enabled Erfan to place two rooms at full height - with a lot of additional drama.</seg>
<seg id="1335">For the mezzanine a classic copper light window of Retrouvius overlooks the glamorous living area.</seg>
<seg id="1336">Mirrored gold furniture, silver accents and vintage Serge Mouille lighting set the style for the program.</seg>
<seg id="1337">The use of mirrors plays a role in adding theatre, space and light.</seg>
<seg id="1338">At both ends, a short corridor is mirrored to allow it to work longer.</seg>
<seg id="1339">In the kitchen, the mirroring feels like a window in another room.</seg>
<seg id="1340">At the entrance, mirrored units offer space for all the cutlery and glasses of Joanne.</seg>
<seg id="1341">By perceiving a glamorous space, the beauty of the living room can close the kitchen if it is not used.</seg>
<seg id="1342">Folding kitchens are nothing new.</seg>
<seg id="1343">The special thing about this is that it is a garage door.</seg>
<seg id="1344">"a bit of engineering art went inside," explains Erfan from the steel reinforced, veneered MDF door.</seg>
<seg id="1345">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "it is important so that when you push the door very easily slides." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1346">Thanks to the clever use of space and storage, Joanne was able to gain an additional 16 m ², an additional bedroom and an improved layout.</seg>
<seg id="1347">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "at the end of the day you will sell the land - or how your property is valued," "" "" "" "says Erfan." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1348">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "in a rudimentary form, a real estate agent will enter and conduct a calculation based on the soil size." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1349">Here they have managed to enlarge the floor area while using high-quality materials that give the room its luxurious advantage.</seg>
<seg id="1350">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "the materials are the things that you touch and therefore help create an emotional bond in a home," "" "" "" "says Erfan." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1351">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "you don't love electrical outlets in the walls." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1352">These are important, but they don't play with your heart. "</seg>
<seg id="1353">It shows that a flat can transform itself into something quite amazing by a good design and heightened square footage of something standard.</seg>
<seg id="1354">In fact, like Joanne, you could decide not to leave them.</seg>
<seg id="1355">Brothers fight for a 500 million US dollar real estate empire</seg>
<seg id="1356">Two brothers are four decades after their Italian family founded the dynasty, in a dispute due to one of the largest real estate imperial Victorias worth over $500 million.</seg>
<seg id="1357">The former director of the 'Carlton Football Club' and developer Colin De Lutis lives in a villa in Toorak, only three doors from his younger brother Paul. he has brought him to the Supreme Court to clarify how their property and assets should be divided.</seg>
<seg id="1358">Paul wanted to withdraw from family business since 2014, but a sharp conflict of separation takes place in the Supreme Court.</seg>
<seg id="1359">Together with her mother Anna, the brothers have accumulated 38 properties worth over half a billion dollars, since the family purchased a business in Smith Street, Collingwood in 1973.</seg>
<seg id="1360">There, the family founded Westco Jeans and grew up to a chain of 160 retail stores.</seg>
<seg id="1361">It was sold for 85 million US dollars in 1999.</seg>
<seg id="1362">This money has been invested in real estate and the portfolio of De Lutis now comprises offices in the city center, the development areas of Brunswick and Sorrento, the apartments in Gold Coast and Mt Buller as well as shopping centers in the suburbs.</seg>
<seg id="1363">Following an agreement with her deceased father, Colin was described as "principal operator and the dominant personality" in the De Lutis family - about two thirds of the company's assets and Paul about one third.</seg>
<seg id="1364">A court file states that this means that it has ownership in the value of $316 million and Paul worth 176 million dollars.</seg>
<seg id="1365">The distribution of real estate and cash has proved to be a problem for Paul.</seg>
<seg id="1366">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "the departments proposed by Colin have left him with what I held for the best objects," "" "" "", "he wrote in an affidavit in 2015." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1367">Last Friday, after several failed negotiations, the first hearing of the Supreme Court took place.</seg>
<seg id="1368">The brothers are now fighting for control of the existing business - including Colin, as Paul claims to have excluded him.</seg>
<seg id="1369">Colin argues that this is not true, but reproaches Paul to manage some possessions incompetently.</seg>
<seg id="1370">In an early affidavit submitted by Colin, he says he hopes to settle the dispute.</seg>
<seg id="1371">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "my Italian heritage stipulates that the family is the most important priority," "" "" "" "he wrote." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1372">The cost increases in the case of hundreds of pages with affidavits, emails and reports from companies, including Deloitte, Pitcher Partners and Charter Keck Cramer, and with leading lawyers, including Allan Myers, QC, and both sides held law firms.</seg>
<seg id="1373">Mrs. De Lutis and her deceased husband Luigi were Italian immigrants who operated milk and delicatessen from the late 1950s and bought a business in Brunswick in the early seventies.</seg>
<seg id="1374">They used the security to buy the Collingwood property, in which Colin opened the first jeans shop of the family.</seg>
<seg id="1375">Colin says he started Westco when he was the High School in my last years when Paul was still a small child (about 10 years old). "</seg>

<seg id="1388">Trumps's new Chief of Staff plans to limit the president's media abstinence.</seg>
<seg id="1389">Others have tried and failed.</seg>
<seg id="1390">Perhaps John F. Kelly can actually do it.</seg>
<seg id="1391">If so, he will be the first.</seg>
<seg id="1392">Politico reports that the new Chief of Staff of the White House plans to limit the flow of information to President Trump - including the news media reports - hoping to hold the boss on a more uniform course.</seg>
<seg id="1393">Here is a piece by Reporter Josh Dawsey:</seg>
<seg id="1394">"when John F. Kelly, the new Chief of Staff of the White House, met on his first working day with executive employees, he represented a major problem in President Donald Trumps White House, which he wanted to repair: poor information that comes into the hands of the president.</seg>
<seg id="1395">Kelly told the staff that information about him should flow - whether on paper or in briefings - because the president would make better decisions if he would receive good information. "</seg>
<seg id="1396">Kellys diagnosis makes sense, but others have tried to tame trump by monitoring their media diet.</seg>
<seg id="1397">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "President Trumps's relationship to television extends decades - and now where he is in the White House, his TV advertising is still strong." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1398">"when candidate Trump was upset because of unfair coverage, it was productive to show him that he received fair coverage of places that were to convince," said former presidential advisor Sam Nunberg in February in front of Politico.</seg>
<seg id="1399">Politicos Tara Palmeri wrote at the time that "the key to keep Trumps's Twitter habit under control, according to six former campaign officials, is to ensure that his personal media consumption includes a steady praise."</seg>
<seg id="1400">Okay.</seg>
<seg id="1401">But the idea that Trumps's Twitter habit was ever "under control" is ridiculous.</seg>
<seg id="1402">Perhaps these campaign officials are aware of what we do not know others - that Trumps Tweets would have included even more fuel without their interventions.</seg>
<seg id="1403">We will probably never know anything about the tweets that Trump has not sent.</seg>
<seg id="1404">If his co-workers managed to keep him away from him a few times, their efforts paid off.</seg>
<seg id="1405">But no one has consistently prevented Trump controversies.</seg>
<seg id="1406">A part of the problem is that people in a White House composed of competing parties always try to advance their own agenda by presenting Trump material that may promote their views from the world.</seg>
<seg id="1407">Politico - busy with this story - reported in May about the preference of the advisers to bring suspicious information to the President for strategic reasons.</seg>
<seg id="1408">This was an example described by Reporter Shane Goldsmith:</seg>
<seg id="1409">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "current and former trump-officials say that Trump like a volcano can react to negative press cuts, especially those with shameful leaks, and that they are trying to find out where they come from." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1410">This was exactly what happened at the end of February when someone was reluctant to publish a printed copy of an article by Gottschinas, the website of the Internet provocateur, Charles C. Johnson, who accused the deputy chief secretary Katie Walsh "to be the source behind a pile of leaks in the White House.</seg>
<seg id="1411">Although Johnson was permanently banned from Twitter because of harassment or that he has offered no concrete evidence or that he has expressed false accusations in the past and has revoked them.</seg>
<seg id="1412">Trump read the article and started asking people about Walsh. "</seg>
<seg id="1413">Goldsmith added that the then Chief of Staff Reince Priebus and the General Secretary of the White House, Rob Porter, "tried to implement a system to manage and document the trump ram."</seg>
<seg id="1414">How did it work?</seg>
<seg id="1415">Kelly tries three months later to do the same.</seg>
<seg id="1416">Perhaps he will prove himself as a more effective manager than priebus, but Trump is still his impulsive self, and his consultants still strive for influence.</seg>
<seg id="1417">These immutable factors make Kellys's mission very difficult.</seg>

<seg id="1445">The Waldhotel Luise is from the former Hotel Birkenhof.</seg>
<seg id="1446">The house in front of the gates of Freudenstadt is being renovated and is scheduled to be opened on 1 March next year.</seg>
<seg id="1447">These are good news for the city.</seg>
<seg id="1448">Because with the closure of the Birkenhof through the former Ambience operating company GesmbH on the 13th of April 2014, around 30,000 overnight stays were lost per year and also revenue from the tourist tax.</seg>
<seg id="1449">In the fall of 2014, in view of the dramatic increase in numbers of refugees arriving in the district, the hotel building was offered to the district council as a collective shelter, which provided controversial discussions.</seg>
<seg id="1450">The city prevented the placing of asylum seekers by setting up a building plan to secure the area as a hotel location.</seg>
<seg id="1451">The decision was not undisputed at that time in the Municipal Council.</seg>
<seg id="1452">But especially Freudenstadt's mayor Julian Osswald defended the hotel location and already spoke about serious interested people at the house.</seg>
<seg id="1453">He should be right.</seg>
<seg id="1454">The group Luisenhotels with managing director Birgit Scherer with seat in Bad Bergzabela acquired the former Hotel Birkenhof at a voluntary auction in Berlin and wants to make it back to a house of the three-star Plus category under the name Waldhotel Luise.</seg>
<seg id="1455">The group has four houses with the Freudenstadt object.</seg>
<seg id="1456">Two of them in Bad Bergzabera and one in Bad Herrenalb.</seg>
<seg id="1457">You will find Hotel Luise, Luisenpark, Parkhotel Luise and now Waldhotel Luise.</seg>
<seg id="1458">At the former Hotel Birkenhof already for a longer time building shuttles stand in front of the entrance, and when you enter the house, it becomes clear what extensive renovations are carried out.</seg>
<seg id="1459">The floors were pulled out, ceilings were demolished, old bathtubs removed from the rooms.</seg>
<seg id="1460">The entire hotel building is a single building site.</seg>
<seg id="1461">There is still much to do until March.</seg>
<seg id="1462">"it is actually a beautiful hotel," says Thomas Scherer in conversation with our newspaper.</seg>
<seg id="1463">Everything is to be renewed in the Black Forest style.</seg>
<seg id="1464">The rooms are equipped with large walk-in showers, the entrance area is redesigned, new windows are installed.</seg>
<seg id="1465">Everything was to be "pretty bourgeois" later, as Thomas Scherer expresses.</seg>
<seg id="1466">"we want to make a piece of jewellery."</seg>
<seg id="1467">Swimming pool, wellness area and a meeting room are part of the equipment.</seg>
<seg id="1468">You do not want to position yourself at the high level of the hotels in Lauterbad, but already on an upscale downtown level, Scherer emphasizes.</seg>
<seg id="1469">The Waldhotel Luise with its approximately 60 rooms wanted to set up, explains Scherer further.</seg>
<seg id="1470">Both individual vacationers, groups or businessmen should feel comfortable at the hotel.</seg>
<seg id="1471">He has already conducted talks with OB Julian Osswald and Tourism Director Michael Krause, as Scherer.</seg>
<seg id="1472">The notions of the city are identical with those of the hotel group.</seg>
<seg id="1473">"we are on the same line."</seg>
<seg id="1474">According to the level of investment, Thomas Scherer does not want to determine exactly.</seg>
<seg id="1475">Just under one million euros, he expects.</seg>
<seg id="1476">The external systems are also brought to the front, which is already clearly visible.</seg>
<seg id="1477">In a courtyard, a large terrace is created which will be accessible from the restaurant that is open to the public.</seg>
<seg id="1478">Thomas Scherer is optimistic: "Freudenstadt is a good market."</seg>
<seg id="1479">Russia Affair: us Special Investigator sets up Grand Jury</seg>

<seg id="1483">The transmitter CNN reported that there were already initial invitations to the committee in connection with a meeting between Trumps's oldest son and a Russian attorney.</seg>
<seg id="1484">U.S. intelligence agencies have been accusing the Kremlin since a long time being targeted in the 2016 presidential elections.</seg>
<seg id="1485">Mueller investigated whether there were agreements between Trumps election campaign team and Moscow.</seg>
<seg id="1486">The focus of the investigation should be several men who acted as advisors to the Republicans in the election campaign.</seg>
<seg id="1487">According to reports, Mueller also examined more and more drumps in a private and commercial environment.</seg>
<seg id="1488">A few weeks ago, the "Washington Post" wrote that the special agent Trump personally moved into the centre and accused the accusation that the President may have disabled the judiciary in the course of the affair.</seg>
<seg id="1489">The main task of Grand Jury is to examine the evidence in possible crime cases and to decide whether it should be charged.</seg>
<seg id="1490">Grand Jury will therefore also be called anchor clips.</seg>
<seg id="1491">Most of the time, they are turned on when dealing with larger and controversial cases.</seg>
<seg id="1492">The procedure is always carried out behind closed doors.</seg>
<seg id="1493">The Panel can also be turned on by the Public Prosecutor's Office in order to invite individuals to the company under oath.</seg>
<seg id="1494">According to CNN, invitations have already been issued which revolve around the encounter between Donald Trump Jr. and a Russian lawyer.</seg>
<seg id="1495">Persons who were involved in the meeting were called upon to testify, was called in the report.</seg>

<seg id="1513">According to US media, the White House collected material against the special agent and its employees.</seg>
<seg id="1514">This triggered speculation about whether trump Mueller would be released.</seg>
<seg id="1515">Unlike an independent special agent of the Congress, as for example in the Watergate Affair around the later retired president Richard Nixon, Mueller has a position in which he could theoretically be fired at the request of the President of the Ministry of Justice.</seg>

<seg id="1518">Antarctica: giant iceberg moves in Antarctica</seg>
<seg id="1519">In the Westantarctic a gigantic iceberg was detached from the almost seven-fold size of Berlin.</seg>
<seg id="1520">This shared the Bremerhavener Alfred Wegener Institute for Polar and Marine Research on Wednesday.</seg>
<seg id="1521">The Koloss is now driving north and will probably need two or three years until it melts.</seg>
<seg id="1522">With a length of 175 kilometres and a width of up to 50 kilometres, it is one of the largest icebergs that researchers have registered over the past three decades.</seg>
<seg id="1523">There is no danger for humans.</seg>
<seg id="1524">According to research data, the extent to which climate change has played a role in the demolition of the iceberg is unclear.</seg>
<seg id="1525">However, there have been a series of unusual fractures of ice skulls in the region for about 30 years, writes the US research center for snow and ice (NSIDC) in a fact background.</seg>
<seg id="1526">According to many researchers, this could be related to global warming.</seg>
<seg id="1527">The now broken Koloss was a part of Larsen-C-Schelag.</seg>
<seg id="1528">Schelfeira floats on the sea and is fed by large glaciers.</seg>
<seg id="1529">It continues to grow into the sea and breaks down regularly.</seg>
<seg id="1530">The Larsen-C-Schelfeira lies south of South America almost at the top of the Antarctic Peninsula.</seg>
<seg id="1531">To the north of this horseshoe, the balance of waxing and breaking was disturbed several years ago.</seg>
<seg id="1532">AWI researcher Daniela Jansen writes a complete picture file there.</seg>
<seg id="1533">There is some evidence that the Larsen-C-Schelag is in danger, as the front edge has never been as far back as at present.</seg>
<seg id="1534">In addition, the ice-plate stands under tension and can crumble if at a key point breaks down a piece.</seg>
<seg id="1535">The melting of Schelfeits and Eisberg does not increase sea level as they float on the water and ice as much water as it results after the melting itself.</seg>
<seg id="1536">However, the loss of the ice shelf leads to the fact that the glaciers can flow directly into the sea and flow much faster than before.</seg>
<seg id="1537">This could possibly increase sea level, but only in a small degree, the British research project on the observation of Antarctica (Midas).</seg>
<seg id="1538">According to AWI, Larsen-C-Schelfeiture is the fourth-largest archipelago of Antarctica with almost 50 000 square kilometres.</seg>
<seg id="1539">At the transition from the mainland it is up to 700 meters thick, at the front edge to the free ocean about 200 meters.</seg>
<seg id="1540">There it breaks down regularly.</seg>
<seg id="1541">"although it is a natural phenomenon and we are aware of no direct connection to climate change, the ice sheet is now in a more dangerous position," said Martin O'Leary from the British Swansea University.</seg>
<seg id="1542">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "this is the longest retreat since the beginning of the records," "" "" "" "he also confirmed." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1543">Among scientists, it is disputed whether the Larsen-C Shelnail will grow back or fall back in the long term and possibly fall together, said his colleague Adrian Luckman and added: "our models say that it will be less stable."</seg>
<seg id="1544">But this development will take decades.</seg>
<seg id="1545">Even if these researchers do not bring back the demolition of this gigantic iceberg to climate change, many ice-tufts of the Antarctic Peninsula have been discernible over the past decades.</seg>
<seg id="1546">This long skirt of the Antarctica covers South America.</seg>
<seg id="1547">According to the British Antarctic Survey's research programme, the ice surface of the Antarctic Peninsula has decreased by 28,000 square kilometres since the 1950s.</seg>
<seg id="1548">The increase in temperature contributed to the decline.</seg>
<seg id="1549">Over the past 50 years, the Antarctic Peninsula has warmed around three degrees and thus enumerates the areas in which the temperature is the fastest.</seg>
<seg id="1550">CDU wants to be a Haustarif staff at the staff</seg>
<seg id="1551">Because it is becoming increasingly difficult to occupy vacant positions, the CDU demands to step out of the employers' association in order to become more attractive.</seg>
<seg id="1552">Just before the summer break, 41 new positions in administration were established.</seg>
<seg id="1553">More than 1,100 employees and civil servants work for the district administration in Mettmann.</seg>
<seg id="1554">Now 17 apprentices have their first working day behind them.</seg>
<seg id="1555">The apprenticeships at the circle are apparently very sought after.</seg>
<seg id="1556">Around 620 applications were recorded for the places to be distributed this year.</seg>
<seg id="1557">However, there is still a lack of staff to cope with the increased demands and tasks.</seg>
<seg id="1558">Currently there are still 50 vacant positions in the district of Mettmann.</seg>
<seg id="1559">Among other things, we are looking for doctors and engineers, as well as forces of general administration.</seg>
<seg id="1560">In the Kreistag, the CDU wants to take the initiative together with the FDP and UWG and oppose the shortage of skilled workers in the administration.</seg>
<seg id="1561">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "after the wish of the parties, the administration should develop a concept for personnel recruitment and personnel development." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1562">The aim is to not only cover short-term needs to specialists but to counteract the future-oriented assessment of the candidate.</seg>
<seg id="1563">The overall concept should orient itself inward and outward, show concrete measures for newcomers and include a training offensive, call for CDU, FDP and UWG.</seg>
<seg id="1564">That sounds like a good starting point.</seg>
<seg id="1565">Because the circle has to do with personnel problems that you did not know earlier.</seg>
<seg id="1566">Other cities attract good officials and employees and offer attractive conditions.</seg>
<seg id="1567">"" "" "" "the speech is from a real" "" "" "" "competition of public employers." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="1570">But Klaus-Dieter Peoples, Leader of the CDU, goes beyond the common request with his party.</seg>
<seg id="1571">Already in the chalk day, he caused a big surprise when he publicly questioned the labour costs of the personnel and struck the other parties.</seg>
<seg id="1572">People want all the possibilities to be reviewed which enable a withdrawal from the municipal employers' association.</seg>

<seg id="1576">But the tasks of the circle have grown more and more in recent years.</seg>
<seg id="1577">Only a few weeks ago, new premises had to be set up in which employees take care of the provisions of the new prostitution law.</seg>

<seg id="1579">Italy sharpens the tone for NGO Migrants Rescue Boats</seg>
<seg id="1580">Italy has warned the NGOs that use lifeboats for migrants in the Mediterranean warned that they will not be allowed to continue this unless they adhere to new rules for their operations.</seg>
<seg id="1581">"if NGOs do not sign a new code of conduct, it is difficult to see how they can continue working," said interior minister Marco Minnith in an interview with the Turin daily La Stampa.</seg>
<seg id="1582">Minnitis's warning came a day after the Italian authorities had confiscated a boat from the German charity organization 'Youth Returers' because their team worked effectively with human traffickers in a way that facilitated illegal immigration.</seg>
<seg id="1583">The relief organisation, which has been in operation only for one year, refused to comment on detailed allegations of the Italian prosecutor Ambrogio Cartosio.</seg>
<seg id="1584">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "we are very sorry that we cannot operate in the search and rescue zone at the moment," "" "" "" "said the organization in a statement on the social media." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1585">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "we can only judge any accusations that are currently being raised after we have collected all information and can judge the situation." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1586">The Italian authorities had supervised the boat of 'youth sails', the Iuventa since October.</seg>
<seg id="1587">It is thought that its crew is on board dinghy migrants who are directly supplied to them by human traffickers, and that the smugglers can sail off so that ships can be used again.</seg>
<seg id="1588">At least one such meeting was claimed only 1.3 miles off the Libyan coast, according to the Prosecutor of the Prosecutor, whose content was published by Italian media.</seg>
<seg id="1589">The occupation is suspected of exposing itself to the authority of the Italian Coast Guard, the rescue operations in the zone for humanitarian reasons and not from any other motives.</seg>
<seg id="1590">Under the code of conduct, boats such as the Iuventa have to have an Italian police officer on board to monitor their activities.</seg>
<seg id="1591">Only three of the nine NGOs involved in search and rescue operations have so far been willing to adhere to the code: save the Children, Moas from Malta and Pro-Activa Open Arms from Spain.</seg>
<seg id="1592">The latter said on Thursday that the new rules would be considered unnecessary but acceptable, as they would not bring any "major changes or disabilities" of their rescue operations.</seg>
<seg id="1593">Among those who refuse to sign, the Nobel laureate organization is Doctors Without Borders (MSF).</seg>
<seg id="1594">In the meantime, Minnith has said that the number of migrants who arrived in Italy after the emergency measures had declined sharply in recent weeks, suggesting that the efforts to strengthen the Libyan coastguards and cooperation with local mayors have borne fruit.</seg>
<seg id="1595">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "in recent days we have begun to see light at the end of the tunnel," "" "" "" "said the Minister." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1596">He announced plans for further talks with Libyan citizens this month on economic development initiatives and with Chad, Niger and Mali on measures to reduce the number of migrants who leave these countries in hope to reach Europe.</seg>
<seg id="1597">Ascents and trials</seg>
<seg id="1598">Nine Weilerers Biker, the "Berlin Outpost" and two guest drivers met at Wachenheim in the Nordpfalz region for four days to enjoy trials and sightseeings.</seg>
<seg id="1599">Three friendly guides were available for this purpose.</seg>
<seg id="1600">The accommodation in the Wachenheimer Tal proved to be a good starting point for the tours.</seg>
<seg id="1601">The castle and wine festival from Wachenheim was a welcome extra.</seg>
<seg id="1602">The first tour led to the Michaelskapelle above Deidesheim during hot summer temperatures.</seg>
<seg id="1603">There were viewpoints, some on towers, from which one could look far above the Palatinate Forest and the upstream plains.</seg>
<seg id="1604">In between there were repeatedely longer ascents, rewarding for the long trials.</seg>
<seg id="1605">On the second day we went to Bad Dürkheim to the Saline and the Volksfest Wurstmarkt.</seg>
<seg id="1606">Again, the lookout reached an observation point, connected by "flew" trials and moderate ascents.</seg>
<seg id="1607">On the last two days a lot of altimeters were announced.</seg>
<seg id="1608">Caves, rocks, towers, castles, ruins and huts brought welcome breaks.</seg>
<seg id="1609">In Bad Dürkheim the bikers inhaled curative brine in the open-air inhalatorium.</seg>
<seg id="1610">Neustadt was also controlled.</seg>

<seg id="1613">Are the sports stars sitting in front of computer consoles in the future, instead of fighting through the stadium races with wind and weather?</seg>
<seg id="1614">Fact is: e-sport has long since become a serious business, becoming a lucrative business - big stars, millions of fans and huge tourneys with high levels inclusive.</seg>
<seg id="1615">This also recognised the first federal Libyan people who are increasingly engaging in this area.</seg>
<seg id="1616">The beginning of 2015 was the VfL Wolfsburg, later the FC Schalke 04 and last of the VfB Stuttgart, who founded an E-sports division in mid-July and signed two professionals for the computer game FIFA 17.</seg>

<seg id="1621">Robin Dutt also sees great potential in e-sport.</seg>
<seg id="1622">The ex-Trainer of Bayer Leverkusen and Werder Bremen now advises one agency for virtual football players.</seg>
<seg id="1623">"real football has to deal with the 14 to 30-year-olds in particular, that young people will continue to go to the stadium in the future," says the 52-year-old.</seg>
<seg id="1624">And: the clubs tried to conquer all possible markets, especially the Asian ones.</seg>
<seg id="1625">With prominent e-athletes under contract, one could be more often present on these markets more often than once a year to send the league to Asia.</seg>
<seg id="1626">What is it about?</seg>
<seg id="1627">In E-Sport, computer games such as "League Of Legends," "Dota 2," "Counterstrike" or the football simulation FIFA are being challenged at a competition level.</seg>
<seg id="1628">As in normal sports, leagues have long established itself, in which the professionals compete against each other.</seg>
<seg id="1629">And E-Sport is already part of the official programme for the 2022 World Cup.</seg>
<seg id="1630">But is it a proper sport at all?</seg>
<seg id="1631">For many, the idea is certainly getting used to.</seg>
<seg id="1632">Also Ingo Frobbing has dealt with the question for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="1633">For the professor at the German Sport University in Cologne, E-Sport is a sport because it is competitive and show many biological and physical reactions, which can also be found in classical sports - for example, increased heart rates, stress reactions, hormonal changes.</seg>
<seg id="1634">Furthermore, it requires cognitive abilities, a technical and tactical understanding and a fast reaction.</seg>
<seg id="1635">Professional gamers should exercise not only on the console but also their body and look for nutrition.</seg>
<seg id="1636">"the fit player is a good player."</seg>
<seg id="1637">"" "" "" "but Frobbing also sees problems:" "" "" "" "doping is becoming increasingly a topic." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1638">Checks are difficult to perform in online games, and in the scene the structures of classical sports lacked.</seg>
<seg id="1639">The scientist emphasises the high integrative effect of E-Sports.</seg>
<seg id="1640">Players are on the move internationally, which is like a big global family, there are no cross-cultural barriers.</seg>
<seg id="1641">A study conducted by Deloitte and the Federal Association of Interactive Entertainment Software (BIU) predicts rapid growth in e-sport.</seg>
<seg id="1642">In 2016, 50 million euros have been implemented in Germany, mainly via advertising, sponsoring and big tournaments.</seg>
<seg id="1643">In three years, sales are expected to reach 130 million.</seg>
<seg id="1644">That is little against the barely 2.4 billion Euro of the Bundesliga.</seg>
<seg id="1645">However, E-Sport is no longer far from other established sports such as handball, basketball or ice hockey, "the Deloitte consultants write.</seg>
<seg id="1646">Many countries are already on the verge of international growth.</seg>

<seg id="1662">A woman from Massachusetts was sentenced to two and a half years because she encouraged her friend through texts and calls for suicide.</seg>
<seg id="1663">Michelle Carter, now 20, will spend 15 months of her conviction behind bars and five years were suspended on probation.</seg>
<seg id="1664">Carter was sentenced in June due to negligent murder by Conrad Roy who took his life on 13 July 2014.</seg>

<seg id="1680">The case seems to be a legal precedent, as there is no law in Massachusetts that makes it a crime to reclaim another, commit suicide.</seg>
<seg id="1681">Carter was 17 years old when Roy was found dead by a carbon monoxide poisoning in a vehicle in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="1682">The case attracted national attention after Carter's text messages revealed that she encouraged him to end his life.</seg>
<seg id="1683">"hang on, spring from a building, catch yourself, I don't know there are many ways," she said in several news that she had sent in the two weeks before his death while he was on vacation with his family.</seg>
<seg id="1684">In the moments before his suicide she wrote: "you must do it, Conrad" and "Everything you have to do is turn on the generator and you will be free and happy."</seg>
<seg id="1685">Judge Moniz said that Carter was looking for attention by the death of Roy and ordered that she should benefit from the case through some press.</seg>
<seg id="1686">The case has shared the legal opinion.</seg>
<seg id="1687">The few who defended Carter belonged to Amanda Knox, who was sentenced in 2007 for murder of her British co-resident in Italy before being acquitted two years ago.</seg>

<seg id="1689">Joshua Kimbery: learning from the new FC Bayern</seg>
<seg id="1690">The fact that Joshua Kimi was allowed to run as a captain in the Audi Cup is not a coincidence.</seg>
<seg id="1691">The FC Bayern won a big season with the Confed Cup winner - no extra motivation is possible there.</seg>
<seg id="1692">Something was different in his place in the cabin, that looked Joshua Kimberley immediately, even though the additional piece of clothing was very, very small.</seg>
<seg id="1693">But as far and broadly on the second day of the Audi Cup no Philipp Lahm and no Manuel Neuer were to be seen, he made a tie in his arm.</seg>
<seg id="1694">"the trainer did not announce it," said the winner of the Confed-Cup winner after his first deployment as a Bavarian-captain.</seg>
<seg id="1695">Well, the objection could have run better than at 0: 2 vs the SSC Naples.</seg>
<seg id="1696">But the sign from the coach could also interpret Kimi like this.</seg>
<seg id="1697">Not the eight-year old Arturo Vidal was chosen as a game leader in the C-Elf from youth players, debutaries and just out of the holidays.</seg>
<seg id="1698">Sugar is the best way to spread the sugar to those you want to keep in a good mood.</seg>
<seg id="1699">Those who have been chosen to take the heritage of Lahm can only use a little extra motivation.</seg>
<seg id="1700">Kimme confirmed: "this is what you want as a player: take responsibility."</seg>
<seg id="1701">On Wednesday the 22-year-old flattened as a mini-lame over the field.</seg>
<seg id="1702">To the right, that's his position, the white bandage on the arm did the rest.</seg>
<seg id="1703">And Kimberley worked at all in this runway like the one who can take the rudder in his hand.</seg>
<seg id="1704">He gave instructions, tried to direct the unplayed troupe.</seg>
<seg id="1705">He had the view to the whole, while many others were busy with themselves.</seg>
<seg id="1706">Vidal thus to replay his missing fitness (folded scarcely); Renato Sanches with it, to tie the devil out to the achievements of the Asia journey (also only conditionally); and Sebastian Rudy and Niklas Süle will not be negative in their first appearance in the Bayern-Trikot.</seg>
<seg id="1707">This, after all, worked out quite well.</seg>
<seg id="1708">Süle ran beside Kimme, Rudy in front of the defences, both acted confidently.</seg>
<seg id="1709">The well-known Napoli storm was often difficult, and in addition, Süle tried a few times successfully in the construction of the game.</seg>
<seg id="1710">His colleague Rudy admitted that the result was "not as we hoped for."</seg>

<seg id="1712">"" "" "" "game shift, tempo change:" "" "" "" "for this style I was also picked up." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1713">As unusual this Bavaria-world is still for the new entrances, one saw in the connection to the game.</seg>
<seg id="1714">For example, Rudy did not give one or two interviews in the catacombs, but for six or seven interviews.</seg>

<seg id="1725">Company satisfied with Rhineland-Palatinate Minister: economics praises Wissings Tempo</seg>
<seg id="1726">It was often irreconcilable that the relationship between the country and the regional economy, when Eveline Lemke (Green) was still Minister of Economics of Rhineland-Palatinate.</seg>
<seg id="1727">This shows itself after more than a year in which the new Minister of Economy, Volker Wissing (FDP) is in office.</seg>
<seg id="1728">Chambers and companies from the region speak on T V demand from a change in economic policy - and at the same time blame the old ministerial.</seg>
<seg id="1729">Frank Natus, Chairman of the Association of Trierer Companies (VTU), says: "Wissing attacks the wishes of the economy, which Lemke has all blocked."</seg>
<seg id="1730">The biggest turnaround sees Natus in infrastructure policy: the bridging of the motorway between Kelberg and Adenau is at the top of the country's priority list.</seg>
<seg id="1731">This year the Ministry is hoping for a planning process until 2021.</seg>
<seg id="1732">A role in the plans of the country is also played by Westbypass Trier, which is in the urgent need of the Federal Railroads Plan.</seg>
<seg id="1733">The aim is to put the route into operation in December 2020, says Ministry spokeswoman Cornelia Holtmann.</seg>
<seg id="1734">Natus sees this as a signpost to support regional, but internationally competing companies.</seg>
<seg id="1735">The Chamber of Commerce and Industry (Chamber of Commerce) Trier is aiming for a Rhineland-Palatinate label to stimulate sales in supermarkets and to stop the trend of German exports falling apart for ten years.</seg>
<seg id="1736">In addition, Wissing has an open ear for people who want to set up a company, praises the Chamber of Commerce.</seg>
<seg id="1737">The Chamber of Crafts Trier offers an additional incentive for young apprentices in the new master bonus, says managing director Matthias Schwalbach.</seg>
<seg id="1738">A premium of 1,000 euros is foreseen for the passing of the master exam and 2500 euros if graduates learn independently within ten years of master training.</seg>
<seg id="1739">But the homework list for the country remains long.</seg>
<seg id="1740">At the planned road construction, facts are to be created quickly, at the same time the country lacks the necessary personnel, says Jan Glockauer, Managing Director of the Chamber of Commerce of Trier.</seg>
<seg id="1741">Only 29 jobs have been occupied by 56 new engineers who wish to hire Wissing during state-of-the-art mobility.</seg>
<seg id="1742">The IHK has requested to award more contracts to external offices.</seg>
<seg id="1743">Christian Baldauf's CDU faction, Christian Baldauf, refers to calculations of the Court of Auditors, the country has invested more than 20 million euros less in the receipt of country roads in 2017 and 2018.</seg>
<seg id="1744">Frank Natus also expects a concept of the country to address the shortage of skilled workers in the region.</seg>
<seg id="1745">The former broadband expansion in the country was also sobering.</seg>
<seg id="1746">In 2016 regional companies had rated the grid supply in an IHK-survey only with a score of 3,4.</seg>
<seg id="1747">They complained about stockpiling internet connections and quarries.</seg>
<seg id="1748">Ex-economic minister Eveline Lemke is currently out of politics and is still sitting in the Supervisory Board of the wind power company Pro Wind.</seg>

<seg id="1750">Audi to change 850,000 diesel vehicles - car manufacturers face a counter-reaction</seg>
<seg id="1751">One day before the announcement of Audi, BMW said that it would offer to update the software in more than 350,000 vehicles.</seg>
<seg id="1752">The BMW Group said the company believes that "there are more intelligent options than driving restrictions," and thus focused on European cities - including Munich, where BMW is located - to ban or limit diesel vehicles.</seg>
<seg id="1753">Daimler announced on Tuesday that it will modify three million Mercedes vehicles in Europe to reduce its diesel emissions.</seg>
<seg id="1754">None of the companies described the enterprises as recall.</seg>
<seg id="1755">European automotive manufacturers have strongly encouraged the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States to support compliance with rules on carbon dioxide emissions.</seg>
<seg id="1756">But the nitrogen oxides that emit diesel engines are considered carcinogens and can cause asthma.</seg>
<seg id="1757">The costs for the automobile manufacturers to install equipment for neutralising the exhaust gases emitted by diesel vehicles also increase what makes it difficult to keep the price of cars competitive.</seg>
<seg id="1758">German Chancellor Angela Merkel is also accused of hacking the powerful car companies and ignoring the signs of the problem.</seg>
<seg id="1759">The companies try to avoid the mistakes of Volkswagen, which could regulate the use of so-called shutdown equipment that could regulate emissions in order to comply with the regulations when a car was tested, but returned to normal driving conditions.</seg>
<seg id="1760">Several Volkswagen employees were charged in the United States, while others were examined on both sides of the Atlantic.</seg>
<seg id="1761">Last month, the former head of thermodynamics was arrested in Audi's engine development in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="1762">The former manager, Zaccheo Giovanni Pamio, is Italian and is therefore not protected from extradition and could be tried in the United States.</seg>
<seg id="1763">At the beginning of this year, Audi was involved in German criminal investigations at Volkswagen after the authorities accused Audi to have installed a system to circumvent emission regulations in Europe, and an inquiry focused on the United States has been expanded.</seg>
<seg id="1764">The inclusion of Audi into the study could seriously burden Volkswagen. the luxury car manufacturer contributes disproportionately to Volkswagen profits.</seg>

<seg id="1776">Mordillos Knollennes and laughing the suffering</seg>
<seg id="1777">Mordillo was at times one of the most published cartoonists, the cleavage of his characters are his trademark.</seg>
<seg id="1778">Also with 85 the Argentinean is still drawing and working on a film.</seg>
<seg id="1779">"" "" "" "his message: laughing," "" "" "" "for there is too much suffering in the world." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1780">Guillermo Mordillo was born on 4 August 1932 as a son of Spanish immigrant in Buenos Aires.</seg>
<seg id="1781">In the first years as an artist, he suggested, among other things, as a draughtsman for congratulatory cards - which frustrated him.</seg>
<seg id="1782">"the happiest day in my professional life was the day when I lost my job," he said once.</seg>
<seg id="1783">After stops in Lima, New York and Paris, he made a breakthrough at the end of the 1960s: with the publication of his cartoons in "Paris Match," and then also in the "Stern" and other leading magazines around the world.</seg>
<seg id="1784">Even in China, Mordillo found many fans.</seg>
<seg id="1785">Again and again the artist was inspired by cities.</seg>
<seg id="1786">Large, roundish Mordillo figurines cavort in drawings with the Leaning Tower of Pisa, Big Ben in London and the Red Square in Moscow.</seg>
<seg id="1787">In the early morning, according to his own data, he is still sitting at the drawing table, working almost ten hours a day.</seg>
<seg id="1788">About calendars, puzzles, books for young and old, t-shirts, plush animals and watches, his droll figures continue to find much spread worldwide.</seg>
<seg id="1789">He has been working on a cartoon film and a TV series with his characters for six years.</seg>
<seg id="1790">The main character in the film "Crazy Island" is a giraffe - Mordillos most popular animal in his drawings - that has an exchange-footer as an opponent.</seg>
<seg id="1791">For the first time, his figures speak in the 3D film, which should be projected onto the cinema screen in 2019.</seg>
<seg id="1792">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "I don't know exactly what they will say, it's strange for me," "" "" "" "says Mordillo." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1793">The script is not written by him.</seg>
<seg id="1794">For this reason, he rather relies on the TV series which, as its original drawings, is produced wordlessly.</seg>
<seg id="1795">Lavender from Provence is threatened by climate change</seg>
<seg id="1796">It has become a symbol of Provence in the South of France, but there is a warning that it is threatened by climate change.</seg>
<seg id="1797">Lavender is retrograde because of the conditions reminiscent of drought conditions and insect-borne insects, causing great headaches to scientists and farmers who try to find solutions.</seg>
<seg id="1798">Eric Chaisse, an expert in the agricultural research institute CRIEPPAM in Provence, said: "lavender in Provence is effectively jeopardised because the plant has been exposed to the effects of climate change over the past years, which in the spring brought much less rain and in the autumn much more.</seg>
<seg id="1799">This has effects on the lifespan of lavender.</seg>
<seg id="1800">There is also a small cichade, a micro-bacterium that transmits dwarf cicades, and in very dry weather there are many of them. "</seg>
<seg id="1801">And there is a lot in the game.</seg>
<seg id="1802">Lavender oil attracts not only for vacationers, it is also very popular for perfume and cosmetics.</seg>
<seg id="1803">Eric Chaisse said: "instead of having very long plants with a large number of flowers, we have underdeveloped smaller, underdeveloped and either missing or weakened.</seg>
<seg id="1804">"" "" "" "so we have fewer parts with essential oil." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1805">The solutions considered include a better water distribution and slowing of evaporation from the soil, but also spraying the plants with a protective mixture of clay and water and the development of varieties that are more resistant to drought.</seg>
<seg id="1806">The town of Geisa in the Thuringian town of Rhön celebrates its 1200 year anniversary.</seg>
<seg id="1807">The festival highlight is this Saturday and Sunday with a medieval festival.</seg>
<seg id="1808">These days, Krämer, Zündel, Dealer, Vagator, or a prisoner of war should be in the city centre on these days.</seg>
<seg id="1809">The assassination of a journalist underlines the growing threat in Mexico</seg>
<seg id="1810">The staff of the weekly Riodocice usually meet on Wednesdays to review their plans for reporting about the latest chaos in the state of Sinaloa by organised crime, corrupt officials and incessant drug wars.</seg>
<seg id="1811">But on that day, in the shadow of their own tragedy, they came together to talk about security.</seg>
<seg id="1812">It was told them that it is important to change their routines.</seg>
<seg id="1813">Two high-level journalists discuss what feels safer: they are to take their children into the office, who were the target of an attack with grenades in 2009, or leave them at home.</seg>
<seg id="1814">Security experts have written three words on a panel on the front of the room: opponents, Neutral, Allies.</seg>
<seg id="1815">They ask the reporters to propose names for each column - no evidence is needed, perceptions and stomach feelings.</seg>
<seg id="1816">There are drug smugglers, politicians, businessmen, journalists who are suspected of standing on the government's payroll or cartels, a catalogue of criminals who make the chaos of Mexico dangerous.</seg>
<seg id="1817">There is no rest from the violence, and as the bodies accumulate throughout the country, more and more journalists are there: at least 25, since President Enrique Pena Nieto resigned in December 2012. 589 are under federal protection after attacks and threats, and so far there have been at least seven deaths in seven states this year.</seg>
<seg id="1818">Among the latter are her publisher and her inspirer of Riodoce, co-founder Javier Valdez Cardenas.</seg>
<seg id="1819">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "the greatest mistake is to live in Mexico and be a journalist," "" "" "" "wrote Valdez in one of his numerous books on violence in connection with drugs." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1820">His absence is felt deeply, although his presence is everywhere - a big photo of Valdez showing his middle finger with the word "Justice," hangs on the facade of the Riodoce building. two reporters in the 1930's, Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez, wear t-shirts, which show his smiling face with glasses or his typical panama.</seg>
<seg id="1821">The workshop takes place less than two months after his death, and the reporters discuss their shared themes, trauma, nightmares, sleeplessness, paranoia.</seg>
<seg id="1822">Although a Special Federal Attorney General was established in 2010 to process the cases of journalists, it has only initiated two criminal proceedings under the Committee for the Protection of Journalists.</seg>
<seg id="1823">As with most thousands of murders, which are linked to drug trafficking and organised crime every year, the murderers of journalists are rarely put to trial.</seg>
<seg id="1824">At Riodocice, they still insist on treating the violence of Sinaloa, even though they are inconsolable and although the terrain is now more treacherous.</seg>
<seg id="1825">Without information about the murderers, without justice, the meeting for the discussion of security has little use, says Ibarra.</seg>
<seg id="1826">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "it is very stupid to waste my time in this workshop," "" "" "" "he says." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1827">"as long as we don't know why, we mistrust everyone."</seg>
<seg id="1828">On the morning of May 15, Valdez left the office of the newspaper Riodoce in the provincial capital of Culiacan.</seg>
<seg id="1829">He only managed to drive a few blocks before his red Toyota Corolla was stopped by two men. he was forced out of his car and twelve times was shot on him, probably because of the name of the newspaper, which is translated with "twelve river."</seg>
<seg id="1830">The shooter drove away in his car and damaged it nearby.</seg>
<seg id="1831">Valdez was 50 years old.</seg>
<seg id="1832">He left a woman and two grown children.</seg>
<seg id="1833">Rumors tend to fly freely in Culiacan.</seg>
<seg id="1834">But on the subject of Valdez there is practically nothing but silence.</seg>
<seg id="1835">Since Guzman's arrest in the past year and the delivery to the United States in January, Sinaloa has become one of the bloodiest battlefields of the country since rival factions are fighting to fill the vacuum.</seg>
<seg id="1836">It does not matter that in Sinaloa one or more people are shot on the street every day or that the cemetery is full of decorated two-story mouths for drug kings that are larger than many homes for the living.</seg>
<seg id="1837">Forget for a minute that there is a state of "rest" if only a cartel has control over the coastal state with its valuable ports and drug trade routes in the United States.</seg>
<seg id="1838">Nevertheless, despite the fact that Valdez was aware of the dangers of his work, Ismail Bojorquez (60), a co-founder and director of Riodoce, was broken with the guilt that he could not protect his friend.</seg>
<seg id="1839">He believes that two misunderstandings have contributed to the murder.</seg>
<seg id="1840">First of all there was the publication of an interview with Damasco Lopez, a leader of one of the rivalising cartel fractions in the war with Guzmans sons.</seg>
<seg id="1841">This publication may have annoyed the sons, presumed gait members bought each copy of the issue as soon as it was delivered to newspaper kiosks.</seg>
<seg id="1842">The second mistake was not to force Valdez to leave the country for his own security following the confiscation of another newspaper that had published the same story.</seg>
<seg id="1843">Valdez was a legend in Mexico and abroad, and his killing is considered a milestone in Mexican violence against journalists.</seg>
<seg id="1844">He had survived for so long that his friends and colleagues were accepting that he would always be there.</seg>
<seg id="1845">He worked as an experienced reporter for Noroeste in 2003 when he joined five colleagues to establish Riodoce and sold 50 US dollars holdings.</seg>
<seg id="1846">"" "" "" "in Sinaloa," "" "" "" "it was impossible to operate journalism without encountering the drug addiction problem," "" "" "" "said Bojorquez." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1847">With time, the newspaper earned a reputation for courageous and honest reporting, and sales and advertising increased.</seg>
<seg id="1848">Reporters loved being able to publish hard-fitting examinations without fear of censorship, and the readers were fascinated by a publication in which they could read stories that no one else dared to treat.</seg>
<seg id="1849">Eight years after the foundation of Riodocice, she received the prestigious "Maria Moors Cabot Award" for her coverage in Latin America.</seg>
<seg id="1850">In the same year Valdez won the International Press Freedom Award of the Committee for the protection of journalists for his courage in pursuit of Mexican drug history, wherever she led.</seg>
<seg id="1851">He volunteered to be afraid.</seg>
<seg id="1852">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "I want to continue living," "" "" "" "he said at the time of the CPJ award." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1853">"" "" "" "drug trade in Sinaloa" "" "" "" "is a way of life," "" "" "" "he said last October in an interview with Rompeviento-TV." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1854">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "you have to take over the task that you think of as a journalist - either that or you play the dumb." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1855">"" "" "" "I don't want to be asked:" "" "" "" "what have you done in the face of so many dead men... why didn't you tell what was going on?" "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1856">The Riodosif team misses Valdez, the fun bird, who could flue like a dockworker, a friend who was generous with hugs and advice, a teacher who knew how to survive.</seg>
<seg id="1857">They trusted in his routine.</seg>
<seg id="1858">He would always wear his hat.</seg>
<seg id="1859">He would always go to El Guayabo, the bar opposite the office, and always sit at the same table there.</seg>
<seg id="1860">Now they ask: was his love for routine his destruction?</seg>
<seg id="1861">His death also forced them to question their own assumptions about how they can do their work best and stay alive.</seg>
<seg id="1862">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "they don't like it if you deal with their wives, their children, their clean shops, home starting and landing lanes" "" "" "" "to move drugs." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1863">"these things were not allowed," said Bojorquez.</seg>
<seg id="1864">The result is, even in the best times, a high degree of self-censorship and self-preservation.</seg>
<seg id="1865">Trust his own instincts.</seg>
<seg id="1866">If it smells wrong, leave it away.</seg>
<seg id="1867">The anger is, the editor of the Riodoce Andres Villarreal said that "smell a sense that can be fooled... and then things happened to Javier."</seg>
<seg id="1868">The old rules, as he and others say, are no longer valid in Sinaloa - just as in Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Guerrero and other states where a poisonous mix of lucrative smuggling routes, weak institutions and corrupt government officials are at home.</seg>
<seg id="1869">The landscape changes constantly.</seg>
<seg id="1870">In the room where the staff of Riodoce met for security training, no mobile phones suddenly were allowed. days before, Spyware, which is sold exclusively to governments, was used to monitor journalists and activists in Mexico.</seg>
<seg id="1871">Outside, two policemen were looking for protection from the heat of 104 degrees (40 ° C) in the shade of a tree.</seg>
<seg id="1872">They were commissioned by the provincial government to protect the offices of Riodoce in a four-storey building in a mid-class neighborhood of Culiacan.</seg>
<seg id="1873">Half in the joke, some of the reporters asked whether these officers belonged to the 50 percent of the policemen who called the governor themselves as untrustworthy.</seg>
<seg id="1874">It is months since the reporters have gone to the mountain landscape where the drug gangs are de facto under control.</seg>
<seg id="1875">For the issue of this week Riodoce has fucked on three main stories.</seg>
<seg id="1876">There was the murder of the brother of the former well-known speaker Julio Cesar Chavez in Sinaloa.</seg>
<seg id="1877">They also had an exposé to the state expenditures concentrated on the home town of the governor.</seg>
<seg id="1878">And there was a group that went through a kidnapping in one of the most expensive restaurants in Culiacan, a block from the Office of the Prosecutor.</seg>
<seg id="1879">There was no official word about who was kidnapped or what happened, so be careful when it was time to write what everyone in town knows that the restaurant is a favorite local of drug dealers and authorities.</seg>
<seg id="1880">A reporter learned from public records that the restaurant was registered under the name of a politician who ruled the governing Institutional Revolution Party (PRI), which dominated all political levels almost the whole century.</seg>
<seg id="1881">Recently, several PRI governors were charged with high-caliber cases of corruption.</seg>
<seg id="1882">Villarreal asked the reporter to write about previous incidents in this local area, including one in which a son of "El Chapo" Guzman escaped a military assault.</seg>
<seg id="1883">Just a few months earlier, the readers would have viewed the Valdez column as the best informed source of kidnapping.</seg>
<seg id="1884">"in the past we would have known what happened," said Villarreal, 46, with the nickname "El Flaco" because of his slender body stature.</seg>
<seg id="1885">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "now all channels of communication with our sources are broken." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1886">Valdez's office became a storage room for signs and stickers protesting against the killings of journalists, because the employees have become something they never expected: activists in the name of the press.</seg>
<seg id="1887">Reporter Miriam Ramirez took a few signs and went next morning for a demonstration because of another journalist to the office of the prosecutor.</seg>
<seg id="1888">Salvador Adame disappeared three days after Valdez had been killed in the western state of Michoacan.</seg>
<seg id="1889">A burned body has been discovered and officials say, based on DNA testing that it is its.</seg>
<seg id="1890">In the whole country journalists have become phonetic by writing down in organized protests "SOS Press" on pavements and buildings.</seg>
<seg id="1891">On that day, the director Bojorquez goes away in Washington and tries to collect international support for the judiciary in the case of Valdez.</seg>
<seg id="1892">During a meeting with the governor of Sinaloa on the day following the assassination of Valdez, Ramirez accused the authorities of scoring journalists and killing them because they told the truth.</seg>
<seg id="1893">She has since then asked her to be regrouped by the government because she is concerned that her anger has violated her objectivity.</seg>
<seg id="1894">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "Valdez had repeatedly said that journalists in Mexico were surrounded by organised crime, government officials and a valid society." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1895">In his last book, "Narco-Journalism," he wrote that reporters were not only killed by drug gangs, but also on the command of politicians and security forces who were hiding under a blanket with organised crime.</seg>
<seg id="1896">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "the media guard group" Articulo 19 "" "" "" "" has been assigned more than half of the attacks on journalists of the police and officials in the past year. "" "" "" "</seg>
<seg id="1897">"in Mexico you die because they want you to keep your mouth," said Ramirez.</seg>
<seg id="1898">Obviously the killings have a deterrent effect.</seg>
<seg id="1899">No one forgets the death of the blogger Maria Elizabeth Macias in the northern border state Tamaulipas six years ago.</seg>
<seg id="1900">Your body was found together with a note that was allegedly signed by the Zetas bin: "here I am because of my reports."</seg>
<seg id="1901">A computer keyboard and headphones were placed next to their separate head.</seg>
<seg id="1902">Some branches have chosen to close, such as the newspaper El Norte in the northern border state Chihuahua after the assassination of correspondent Miroslava Breach in March.</seg>
<seg id="1903">Others continue to do as El Manana of Nuevo Laredo did after the assassination of her director in 2004.</seg>
<seg id="1904">In 2010, the Diario de Ciudad Juarez publicly addressed the drug cartels with an editorial on the title page entitled "What do you want from us?"</seg>

<seg id="1926">The report in the journal "Current Biology" described him as "the persistent buffered dinosaur who has ever been found, and one of the best dinosaurs in the world."</seg>
<seg id="1927">The fossil is a newly discovered species of Nodosaurier, living in the middle of the Cretaceous period between 110 million and 112 million years ago.</seg>
<seg id="1928">His incredibly well preserved condition has baffled researchers who describe it as "truly remarkable."</seg>
<seg id="1929">According to National Geographic reports, the armored herbivorous eater is the best preserved fossil of its kind.</seg>
<seg id="1930">It was found by Shawn Funk when he dug in the Suncor Millenium Mine near Fort McMurray in the north of Alberta, Canada on March 21, 2011.</seg>
<seg id="1931">He hit something out of the surrounding rock, and decided to look more closely.</seg>
<seg id="1932">The fossil discovered by him was sent to the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Paleontology.</seg>
<seg id="1933">They spent the next six years discovering the wild animal within the 2,500 pound (1,100 kg) heavy earth clump.</seg>
<seg id="1934">After all this hard work, the finished result is now ready to be revealed.</seg>
<seg id="1935">"if you only blink a bit with your eyes, you might almost believe that it slept," said the author Caleb Brown, scientist at the Royal Tyrrell Museum, where the creature is to be seen.</seg>
<seg id="1936">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "it will go into the history of science as one of the most beautiful and best preserved dinosaurs - the Mona Lisa of the dinosaur." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1937">Researchers have discovered that these herbivores, although covered with armor and resemble a shifting tank, probably have been threatened by carnivorous dinosaurs.</seg>
<seg id="1938">The heavily armoured dinosaur used a red and white camouflage to hide from predators, and used a shielding technique known as a counteract that is also used by many modern animals.</seg>
<seg id="1939">This would have allowed us to better interfere with its surroundings and to evade its enemies, experts say, suggesting that it was threatened by major dinosaurs.</seg>
<seg id="1940">The 110 million years old creature from the Nodosaurier family has made headlines in May and is now to be seen at the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Palaeontology.</seg>
<seg id="1941">Researchers have now studied the wild animal and called it Borealopelta markmitchelli in accordance with the Museum technician Mark Mitchell, one of a team that spent more than 7,000 hours to discover it carefully.</seg>
<seg id="1942">The amazing preservation of the specimen made it possible for Dr. Mitchell and an international team of scientists to document the pattern and form of scales and armor over his body.</seg>
<seg id="1943">They discovered the shading, a widespread defense method in the animal kingdom, which means that the top of the creature was darker than its underside.</seg>
<seg id="1944">Although the shading is common, the results are surprising as the size of Borealopelta by far exceeds the animals living today.</seg>
<seg id="1945">It points to the fact that dinosaurs were driven from enough pressure by carnivorous dinosaurs that evolution favored the concealment of the confrontation as a means of survival.</seg>
<seg id="1946">But most contemporary animals that use shading - think of deer, zebras or armadillos - are much smaller and more vulnerable than loot, which indicates that this Nowhere has been exposed to a real fight for survival.</seg>
<seg id="1947">"strong predator behavior on a massive, heavily armoured dinosaur show how dangerous the dinosaur predators must have been the chalk time," Brown said.</seg>
<seg id="1948">Chemical analysis of organic compounds in their scales also shows that the skin of the dinosaur was bay.</seg>
<seg id="1949">Scientists continue to investigate the animal on clues about his life, including his conserved intestinal content to find out what he has eaten as his last meal.</seg>
<seg id="1950">They believe that the dinosaur, when he died, got caught up into a river and drove into the sea, where he sank on the back to the seabed.</seg>
<seg id="1951">At that time, Alberta was as warm as Souflorida today, and rivers and oceans are probably far more widespread than they are today.</seg>
<seg id="1952">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "this Nodosaurier is really remarkable because it is completely covered with preserved scaly skin but remains intact in three dimensions and maintains the original shape of the animal," Brown said.</seg>
<seg id="1953">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "the result is that the animal looks almost the same today as in the early Cretaceous period." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1954">You do not need to use a lot of imagination to reconstruct it. if you only look a little with your eyes, you might almost believe that he is sleeping. "</seg>
<seg id="1955">The Cretaceous period was a time when huge theropods, carnivorous dinosaur, that stood on two legs crossed the earth.</seg>
<seg id="1956">Although the king of them, the Tyrannosaurus Rex lived millions of years after Borealopelta, the armoured dinosaur was hunted by some of his terrifying ancestors.</seg>
<seg id="1957">This includes the acrocanthosaurus, a 38 foot (11.5 m) long, six tons weighty monster.</seg>
<seg id="1958">The scientists, whose latest findings appear in the journal Current Biology, believe that Borealopelta sank after death in the sea and was mumified in mud.</seg>
<seg id="1959">The creature was found by Shawn Funk, when he dug in the Suncor Millenium Mine near Fort McMurray in the north of Alberta, Canada on March 21, 2011.</seg>
<seg id="1960">According to the museum it is the best-preserved dinosaur of the world, including skin and armor, and is completely from the muzzle to the hip.</seg>
<seg id="1961">The creatures were average about 18 feet (5 meters) long and weighed up to 3,000 pounds (1,300 kg).</seg>
<seg id="1962">It contained two 20-inch long tips, which protruded from his shoulders.</seg>
<seg id="1963">The researchers believe that the armored herbivores were swept through the western Canada until a flooded river flooded it into the open sea.</seg>
<seg id="1964">But the underwater cremation of the dinosaur kept his armor in exquisite detail.</seg>
<seg id="1965">The petrified remains of this special specimen are so well preserved that the skin stallions always cover bumpy armoured boards along the dinosaur</seg>
<seg id="1966">As Michael Greshko has written for National Geographic, such a level of preservation is as "rare as a win in the lottery.</seg>
<seg id="1967">The more I see it, the more confusing it will.</seg>
<seg id="1968">Petrified remains of the skin still cover the bumpy armored plates that carry the skull of the animal.</seg>
<seg id="1969">His right forefoot is on his side, his five fingers are spread upward.</seg>
<seg id="1970">I can count the dandruff at its sole.</seg>

<seg id="1982">The fire brigade noted the characteristics of the car drivers, which now have to be reckoned with sensitive penalties.</seg>
<seg id="1983">Shortly after 18: 45 a second accident occurred on the A8, this time between Augsburg and Dasing.</seg>

<seg id="1986">Deutsche Bahn: group tests "comfort check-in"</seg>
<seg id="1987">It's a moment that almost everyone has ever experienced: there is nothing to be found in the train and sleeping.</seg>
<seg id="1988">Or one is deepened in his work and has just a brilliant mind.</seg>
<seg id="1989">And then: buffered.</seg>

<seg id="1993">The Deutsche Bahn is currently testing the job-less ticket control.</seg>
<seg id="1994">You simply confirm by mobile phone that you have taken his place and devaluables the ticket.</seg>
<seg id="1995">Currently, a test operation is running on two routes.</seg>

<seg id="1998">"comfort Check-in" is the name of the train card devaluation without any conductor.</seg>
<seg id="1999">In order to be able to use it, however, some requirements must be met: you need a smartphone or tablet.</seg>
<seg id="2000">And you have to book an online ticket - what already most passengers do.</seg>
<seg id="2001">It is also necessary to have the app of the train which DB Navigator has purchased, which is anyway the most convenient way of ticket booking.</seg>
<seg id="2002">And last but not least, you need a seat reservation.</seg>

<seg id="2004">The test customers then have a button for electronic devaluation.</seg>
<seg id="2005">The train attendants receive a message on their mobile devices that passenger X is in the train and has taken the seat Y.</seg>
<seg id="2006">If the train attendant arrives at PLAY ticket inspection, he knows that a passenger sits there with an already used online ticket.</seg>
<seg id="2007">So you can continue to sleep, work on, keep silent.</seg>
<seg id="2008">The "check-in" has two advantages: one for the customer, one for the train - which in turn is intended to take advantage of passengers.</seg>
<seg id="2009">"if you want to travel relaxed without ticket control by our train crew, simply check in the DB Navigator itself.</seg>
<seg id="2010">This enables passengers to make their travel time more personal in the train, "says Michael Peterson, DB's marketing management board.</seg>
<seg id="2011">"" "" "" "second Plus:" "" "" "" "and our employees have more time than today to respond to individual customer needs." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2012">Those who often drive train know that in addition to delays and missed trains, ticket inspections are among the biggest offences.</seg>
<seg id="2013">Because often one has, in any case, one of the contributors not all the documents needed for the devaluation of online tickets.</seg>
<seg id="2014">Either the credit card or the identity card or otherwise a document you have to demonstrate.</seg>
<seg id="2015">The result is endless discussions between train attendant and passenger, leading to a bad mood in the compartment or big space and delays in controlling their own ticket and taking the conductor at the end of time to take care of other concerns.</seg>
<seg id="2016">Only a small number of test customers can use the new service.</seg>
<seg id="2017">And that applies only to ICE 915 Dortmund-Stuttgart and ICE 912 Stuttgart-Essen.</seg>

<seg id="2020">On 9 August 2014 Brittany Ferrell was shaken to its core.</seg>
<seg id="2021">Only one day after she arrived in New York City, she was sitting in St. Louis building on the bed of an Airbnb apartment she rented and scrolled through Facebook on her phone.</seg>
<seg id="2022">She stumbled across a post from someone from the High School.</seg>
<seg id="2023">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "the police have just killed a 18 year old child and it is still on the road," "" "" "" "he said there." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2024">Confused as no one else had posted the information on their feed, she closed Facebook and opened Twitter.</seg>
<seg id="2025">A user with the Handle @ TheePharoah was constantly saved on their timeline.</seg>
<seg id="2026">The rapper from the area of St. Louis was to tweeter the death of Michael Brown, an unarmed black 18-year-old, who was killed by a white policeman in Ferguson, Mo.</seg>
<seg id="2027">He posted an image of Brown's lifeless body, stretched out on the street and would stay there for four hours.</seg>

<seg id="2030">She set off her cell phone to return to Tweet on the Canfield Drive later in the evening.</seg>
<seg id="2031">There were photos of the police band and people crying out, and from a man who claimed to be Brown's father who wore a sign with the inscription: "Ferguson's police has just killed my unarmed son!"</seg>
<seg id="2032">She observed a live feed in which a policeman was standing in front of a group of demonstrators with a barking dog.</seg>

<seg id="2038">She booked a return flight and went home the next day.</seg>
<seg id="2039">After the landing at 11pm she took her 6 year old daughter from her father's house and decided that the two would drive to Ferguson the next morning.</seg>
<seg id="2040">What happened in the next three years with Ferrell and Ferguson is the theme of a new documentary film, "Whose Streets?," in cinemas from the age of 11.</seg>
<seg id="2041">It is a story of survival and protest, love and loss, strength and resistance that consists of the point of view of the people living in the community and filled the streets to demand answers.</seg>
<seg id="2042">When Ferrell with her daughter, who wore a flower dress and a matching crown, drove to Ferguson, the two discussed a conversation that they had "over the black experience and the black state" countless times before this morning.</seg>

<seg id="2050">"" "" "" "I feel I would give her a bad service to keep her away from it." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2051">The first station, when they arrived in Ferguson, was located at the South Florissant Road, a place opposite the police station, which became a camp area when the activists were waiting for the potential non-charge of officer Darren Wilson.</seg>
<seg id="2052">There Ferrell and her daughter joined a local business owner who had lunch.</seg>
<seg id="2053">They prepared bags and helped to pass them on to demonstrators.</seg>
<seg id="2054">Slowly a new kind of activism began to take shape for Ferrell.</seg>
<seg id="2055">"my activism changed completely after August 9," she said and realized that she was a student at the University of Missouri-St. Louis, President of the Minority Student Nurses Association and focused on food justice and health inequalities in black communities.</seg>
<seg id="2056">"I had no experience in organizing.</seg>
<seg id="2057">It has all come. "</seg>
<seg id="2058">Weeks later, during an evening demonstration, Ferrell met Sabaah Folayan, one of the co-directors of the film.</seg>
<seg id="2059">Folayan said she and her cameraman Lucas Alvarado-Farrar wanted to "document" what happened.</seg>
<seg id="2060">A question came to Ferrell in mind: "do you want to document or try to find a story you can exploit?"</seg>
<seg id="2061">This scepticism was nourished by countless cases of people, often of whites - in a community that benefited from their pain and their resilience.</seg>
<seg id="2062">"" "" "" "as Folayan recently said in an interview:" "" "" "" "we have heard that people born and raised in Ferguson have not centered their voices and we wanted to do it differently." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2063">Folayan had co-worked with the then co-director Damon Davis, an artist from the area known for his activism around the death of death inmates.</seg>
<seg id="2064">His involvement brought Ferrell closer to the project, along with six other natives followed the team of "Whose Streets?" in the years after Browns shooting.</seg>

<seg id="2067">The goal was not to concentrate on Ferris's experience - to show that the movement "is not a Messiah-leader, but a community that comes together," said Folayan - she proved to be the most open participant in the film.</seg>
<seg id="2068">As a result, documents of "Whose Streets?" surprising personal aspects of Ferrero's life as she falls in love and marries her wife.</seg>
<seg id="2069">"I felt like naked," Ferrell said and laughed when she saw the finished product for the first time.</seg>
<seg id="2070">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "but I have understood that there must be a certain vulnerability in this work and in the humanization of black people." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2071">Furthermore, Ferris's history repeats the role of black gay women in the wider Black-Lives-Matter movement.</seg>
<seg id="2072">Two of the three founders of the Movement, who after killing the black teenager Trayvon Martin in 2012 marked the film "BlackLivesMatter" in social media, identify themselves as gay.</seg>
<seg id="2073">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "black, gay women in leadership positions have carried the movement altogether," "" "" "" "said Ferrell," "" "" "" "and therefore we are constantly fighting on different fronts." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2074">"" "" "" "black gay women must wear the main burden of everything." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2075">"" "" "" "Folayan agreed to note that" "" "" "" "the movement really is held upright by black women and many black women." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2076">However, it insists that "this is not an affirmative type of action," when Ferrell was chosen as the heart of the film because of her identity.</seg>
<seg id="2077">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "she was the person who throws this energy," she said. "" "" "" "</seg>
<seg id="2078">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "it is not a coincidence, although it was at the front, because in a life at these crossroads as a black gay woman there is so much on the game." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="2081">Ferrell is on parole for 2 ½ years because of blocking a highway at a demonstration.</seg>
<seg id="2082">She describes the socio-political atmosphere of the area she calls her home: "chaos."</seg>

<seg id="2089">The bit gallery moves people even though it has not been built for a long time.</seg>

<seg id="2094">While the advocates build that a gallery attracts more customers into the city, from which the rest of the shops will benefit, the opponents fear that the pedestrian zone will bleed out.</seg>

<seg id="2124">A matching similarity: artist creates portraits with Chelsea Manning DNA</seg>
<seg id="2125">In the middle of the space of the Fridman Gallery in New York many faces are to be seen - white, black and brown, which are almost imperceptible - hanging on cables from the ceiling.</seg>
<seg id="2126">The 30 portraits were created by the artist Heather Dewey-Hagborg from Wangen-Tupfern and hair segments that were sent to her by Chelsea Manning.</seg>
<seg id="2127">Manning sent the excerpts from Fort Leavenworth prison, where the former secret service analyst served a 35-year prison sentence after having publicized diplomatic reports on WikiLeaks website.</seg>
<seg id="2128">The new exhibition opened on 2 August is called A Becoming resemblance (A matching similarity).</seg>
<seg id="2129">She is the product of two years correspondence between Dewey-Hagborg, whose discipline combined her expertise in technology, computer science and art, and Manning, a Transwoman and dissident dissident, whose conviction was transformed by Barack Obama when he had only three days in office.</seg>
<seg id="2130">Dewey-Hagborg has been created by algorithmic analysis of DNA that was extracted from Manning and created from the 30 portraits, such as someone with these genomic data, a sharp, though some intellectual commentary, not only to the form of DNA data - the many ways how they can be interpreted and the inherent determinism of these interpretations - but also for identity.</seg>
<seg id="2131">Manning, who was born when Bradley Edward but already spoke openly about identification as a woman since her puberty, was sentenced to 20 charges in 2013, including six violations of the espionage law, computer fraud and theft.</seg>
<seg id="2132">Through the prison her picture was suppressed, so much that there was only one photo - a grainy, black-white selfie, in which Manning was visibly sitting on a driver's seat and wearing a platinum-blonde wig - with whom she was associated.</seg>
<seg id="2133">In 2015, Dewey-Hagborg was just about the great success of her 2012 project 'Stranger Visions'.</seg>
<seg id="2134">The artist produced portraits of strangers from forensic artifacts such as cigarette butts and chewing gum by extracting DNA from waste to produce a picture of how these people could look.</seg>
<seg id="2135">This was the time she received an e-mail from a newspaper magazine.</seg>
<seg id="2136">"they performed an interview with Chelsea Manning while she was in prison and they wanted a kind of portrait to accompany this article," said Dewey-Hagborg at a press preview of the new exhibition.</seg>
<seg id="2137">And she couldn't be visited at that time and she could not be photographed, so you got in touch with Chelsea and asked her if she wanted to make a DNA portrait.</seg>
<seg id="2138">The artist and her incarcerated mice were turned into unequal spectacles, which in the course of two years exchanged several letters.</seg>
<seg id="2139">They even created a Comic "Suppressed Images" comic illustrated by Shoili Kanungo, which foresaw a future in which the president would convert Chelny's judgment and it would be able to see the exhibition in person.</seg>
<seg id="2140">The fact that Obama was actually only a few days after the book was published to call Manning's release after seven brutal years in a military prison in Kansas was a welcome kind of happy meeting.</seg>
<seg id="2141">There is also now something deep and strong at the opening of the exhibition, as Donald Trump leads a war against informants from the government camp and against Transgender troops, in order to find new, tweetable paths to further inflame the rigid divisions that he was supposed to correct.</seg>
<seg id="2142">When Dewey-Hagborg was asked about the strange timing of all these things, she said that "things are going to happen for a certain reason."</seg>
<seg id="2143">In a artistic statement written on the wall of the gallery Manning called with her oversized signature among them (the "i" in her family name is marked with a heart) an end of "automatic fragmentation, the basis of gender, race, sexuality and culture."</seg>
<seg id="2144">On the opposite wall, their mitochondrial DNA sequence - a thousandth of Cs and Gs and As, is written in pencil.</seg>
<seg id="2145">Dewey-Hagborg hoped to show through the inclusion of the 200 letters (or nucleotides after the highly developed scientific dictionary of the artist), as amazingly similar, at least in organic ways, we are all.</seg>
<seg id="2146">"what people will hopefully take with them is that our genome does not care about who we are and how openly genetic data are for an interpretation and how subjective they are," said Dewey-Hagborg, whose video work from 2007, Spurious Memories, is also to be seen.</seg>
<seg id="2147">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "DNA data can tell so many different stories, therefore these are 30 of these stories." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2148">The last piece in the exhibition, which is stored in a separate room, is a page from the above-mentioned comic novel.</seg>
<seg id="2149">She shows Manning as she appears with a hands-free phone in his hand from the barracks of the United States like King Kong.</seg>
<seg id="2150">"when they make your speech cold, they have won," it says.</seg>
<seg id="2151">"so never stop the mouth."</seg>
<seg id="2152">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "it came directly from a letter that she wrote to me," "" "" "" "said the artist, who greets from Philadelphia." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2153">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "I still get goose bumps when I talk about it." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2154">Manning has not yet seen the exhibition personally - just as it was anticipated in the comic book - but if she should do it, then she will be greeted in the middle of the room by the masks, from her own genomic simulacres, who assemble like hordes of protesters.</seg>
<seg id="2155">This was also target-oriented, like everything in the exhibition, up to the size (5 "2, Manning Statur), in which her genetic haplogroups were written with pencil.</seg>
<seg id="2156">"in the past, I had them on the wall, but I wanted them to feel like a crowd," said Dewey-Hagborg of portraits.</seg>

<seg id="2159">A nation-wide man hunt is underway for a professor at Northwestern University and an employee at Oxford University who are looking for suspects after a man was stabbed in a luxurious apartment in Chicago with deadly injury.</seg>
<seg id="2160">On Monday, for Wyndham Lathem (42) and Andrew Warren (56) arrest warrants were issued on account of their alleged involvement in the death of Trenton H James Cornell-Duranleau, as the acts of the Local Court of Cook County are showing.</seg>
<seg id="2161">The documents say Cornell-Duranleau, 26, died after several stitches.</seg>
<seg id="2162">A common warning system published by the Chicago police authority states that the body was discovered on 27 July.</seg>
<seg id="2163">Officials received a call, arrived at the Grand Plaza Apartments and found the victim with several injuries to his body.</seg>
<seg id="2164">Cornell-Duranleau was declared dead on the spot and detectives investigate the stitches as murder, while the police actively seek the two suspects, said public officials.</seg>
<seg id="2165">Laa has been an associate Professor of Microbiology and Immunology at the Northwestern University since 2007.</seg>
<seg id="2166">Alan K. Cubbin, vice-president for university relations, said in an e-mail statement that he was now in absence and had been excluded from entering the campus of Northwestern University.</seg>

<seg id="2169">A spokesman at the University and Somerville College said in an email explanation that "we are in contact with the police in the UK and ready to help U.S. investigators in any way possible."</seg>
<seg id="2170">The statement added that Warren's colleagues were shocked and want him to stand.</seg>
<seg id="2171">Chief Communications Officer of the Chicago Police Department, Anthony Guglielmi, said he strongly urged the suspects to submit to the authorities.</seg>
<seg id="2172">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "the police have an idea of their whereabouts, and our efforts to locate them strengthen themselves," "" "" "" "said Guglielmi." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2173">Guglielmi said that local, regional and national authorities are helping to find the suspects.</seg>
<seg id="2174">Guglielmi said the police received a call from the building manager of the Grand-Plaza building, who had just received a mysterious tip saying that something had happened in apartment 1008.</seg>
<seg id="2175">The police described the scene as very cruel.</seg>
<seg id="2176">Guglielmi said it was unclear whether the incident occurred on 27 July.</seg>
<seg id="2177">It was confirmed by security cameras that Lathemed and Warren were in the building.</seg>
<seg id="2178">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "we believe Professor Latham and the victim had a relationship," "" "" "" "said Guglielmi." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="2181">Russian Deputy Prime Minister Vitaly Mutko said that it will not take long before the remaining criteria of the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) will be implemented for the restoration of the Russian Anti-Doping Agency (RUSADA).</seg>

<seg id="2184">The PM commented on the second part of the WADA schedule for compliance with the code that describes the criteria for the re-establishment of RUSADA and was recently published on the organization's website.</seg>
<seg id="2185">According to Mutko, he doesn't include anything that could cause concern for Russia.</seg>
<seg id="2186">"everything has been announced, everything is being implemented.</seg>
<seg id="2187">And the results will be presented to the International Olympic Committee (IOC) and WADA in the near future, "he added.</seg>
<seg id="2188">However, one of the criteria listed in the list specifies that the Russian anti-doping authorities must publicly accept the reported results of the investigation approved by the Canadian lawyer Richard McLaren on alleged state funded doping in Russian sports.</seg>
<seg id="2189">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "in terms of the matter," "" "" "" "we carry out the investigation, as our anti-doping system has made a mistake." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="2192">Mother's words coincided with those of Vitaly Smirnov, the head of the independent Russian Anti-Doping Commission.</seg>
<seg id="2193">In conversation with the Russian sales office rsport at the beginning of the day, Smirnov had problems of the past in Russian anti-doping organizations, but added: "we have repeatedly said that the report contains controversial positions and regulations.</seg>
<seg id="2194">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "no one has to accept this report unconditionally," "" "" "" "Smirnov added." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2195">RUSADA was excluded from the implementation of doping controls in Russia in November 2015 as part of the Doping Skandals of the WADA.</seg>
<seg id="2196">However, you were allowed to plan and coordinate testing under the supervision of international experts and the UK Anti-Doping (UKAD).</seg>

<seg id="2203">The start-ups that will help your company not become the next Uber</seg>
<seg id="2204">Amy Errett wanted to measure luck with your e-commerce start-up, but the surveys did not work.</seg>
<seg id="2205">Responses were often vague, little helpful or - worse - deceitful.</seg>
<seg id="2206">And even if you promised anonymity, some workers did not trust the process.</seg>
<seg id="2207">"there was simply never consistency and objectivity," said Errett who runs the 75-person San Francisco e-Commerce Hair Care Company Madison Reed.</seg>
<seg id="2208">She has called people from outside for help.</seg>
<seg id="2209">A new breed of Human Resources start-ups is on the grow to help companies find out how their employees feel.</seg>
<seg id="2210">By creating and licensing software that has the specific purpose of measuring employee engagement, it allows companies to perform surveys, to offer special groups and demographic groups, to address employees anonymity and complaint hotlines, and in some cases allow Whistleblowers to circumvent the C-Suite managers and turn directly to the Board of Directors.</seg>
<seg id="2211">"you now have tools like Strava and Fitbit for tracking your health, but where's the Fitbit for your company?" said Jim Barnett, co-founder and Chief Executive of Redwood City Start-up Glint, whose software analytics tools are used by companies to measure employee engagement.</seg>
<seg id="2212">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "Errett said she had a better insight into what your employees think and feel in the three years with Glint." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2213">In addition to the Snap surveys and surveys of specific teams, it provides a heat card of the company that shows at a glance which units have most complaints and which managers have low consents results - so that you can reboot why.</seg>
<seg id="2214">Companies are coming to see that they have to remain at the top of the workplace culture so that you won't be the next Uber who has been involved in scandals since a former employee has published a blog post that describes an environment of nuisance where those who have spoken have been punished.</seg>
<seg id="2215">For start-ups such as Glint, this wish is an overview of a lucrative business opportunity.</seg>
<seg id="2216">Global governance, regulation and compliance sector could have more than $118.7 billion in 2020, according to the finance-technical website Let's Talk Payments.</seg>
<seg id="2217">Denver, Colorado, Start-up Convercent, the company helps to prevent and detect bad behavior, saw an increasing interest and activity beginning of this year amid the Uber Fall in Misskredit.</seg>
<seg id="2218">Cent has almost 600 clients including Airbnb, Microsoft and Tesla.</seg>
<seg id="2219">Uber has recently signed up as a client.</seg>
<seg id="2220">As Glint, Convercent lets companies send custom "pulse" surveys, collect sensitive answers in real time and view the heat maps of your problem areas.</seg>
<seg id="2221">It also offers an anonymous SMS hotline that allows employees to report bad behavior.</seg>
<seg id="2222">And if the chief executive officer is involved, complaints go directly to the Supervisory Board.</seg>
<seg id="2223">"public opinion has seized the regulators," said Patrick Quinlan, the founder and CEO of Convercent.</seg>
<seg id="2224">If a company is found that treats its employees badly or behave ethically, it can experience costly consequences by consumers boycott, employee fluctuation and complaints, said Quinlan.</seg>
<seg id="2225">Ruby Tuesday, the restaurant chain with more than 25,000 employees and more than 500 sites, has appointed Convercent for more than a year to ensure that employees are aware of the policies and procedures and have an easy way to reach their corporate headquarters.</seg>
<seg id="2226">Previously, if an employee wanted to report a problem, he or she had to find a telephone number or email for the company headquarters, submit a formal complaint and hope he was taken seriously.</seg>
<seg id="2227">It was often a timidation and uncomfortable experience, said James Vitrano, Ruby Tuesdays General Counsel, who said there was no good way to track the complaints of employees.</seg>
<seg id="2228">Now that the company employs Convercent, problems that previously have been hidden by executives who were sitting in offices in cities or states were hidden - such as discrimination, harassment or unfair interns faster and addressed.</seg>
<seg id="2229">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "I can approach this holistic, 360-degree view into the experience with employment," "" "" "" "said Vitrano, who runs the Risk Management Group of Ruby Tuesday." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2230">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "and we protect our shareholders from employment disputes." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2231">Companies began to take Ethics, Values and Employees' involvement in 2002, after the accounting firm Arthur Andersen collapsed because of ethical violations due to the Enron scandal, Quinlan said.</seg>
<seg id="2232">"" "" "" "but it took until the" "" "" "" "social media came to their right" "" "" "" "that companies realized that they could not prevent their dirty laundry being online." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="2234">Both Glint and Convercent offer your software as a service, and charge the companies with recurring charges for the use of their products.</seg>
<seg id="2235">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "it is a business model and a chance that will find the approval of Venture Capital Investors who have supported both start-ups." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2236">Converse received $10 million in funding in February by companies such as Sapphire Ventures and Tola Capital, which raised the total capital to $47 million.</seg>
<seg id="2237">Glitzers secured $10 million in November of Bessemer Venture Partners and raised its total funding to $60 million.</seg>
<seg id="2238">These investments are hardly surprising, given the connected nature of companies, culture and venture capital.</seg>
<seg id="2239">There is a growing research complex that shows that today's employees expect more from their jobs than before.</seg>
<seg id="2240">Competitive markets such as Silicon Valley are high salaries and interesting projects only.</seg>
<seg id="2241">The employees want the feeling that you are accepted and appreciated and that you give your time to a company with a positive mission.</seg>
<seg id="2242">"when people are happy to be in a company that is their voices, and that the work they do is worthwhile, then they feel more committed to making this company successful," said Nina McQueen, Vice President of Global Benefits and Employee Experience at LinkedIn, both Convercent and Glint.</seg>
<seg id="2243">Investors can achieve yields when their portfolio companies run well. companies are running well when employees are committed and committed.</seg>
<seg id="2244">When the analytics tools of third parties promise to increase commitment and commitment of employees, it is no wonder that you will find support.</seg>
<seg id="2245">The data on employee engagement according to the experts of workplace culture is important.</seg>
<seg id="2246">But the data is useless if the administrators of a company do not take action.</seg>
<seg id="2247">In fact, when a company asks staff for your feedback, it may have an expectation that change is on the way.</seg>
<seg id="2248">And if the change does not come quickly enough, or not at all, this disappointment can grow and hire employees.</seg>
<seg id="2249">"if you ask for 4,000 suggestions, you'll have to be willing to have 4,000 talks," said Russell Raath, President of Consulting at the Business Management firm Kotter International, who has seen companies that have relied too much on collecting data.</seg>
<seg id="2250">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "for if you will not follow employees," "" "" "" "Do you really listen to me?" "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="2253">Madison Reed, who now performs monthly employee surveys, was able to initiate actions on the same day if a problem is reported on Glint, so rett.</seg>
<seg id="2254">And after collecting feedback from frustrated employees, it was able to reorganize several teams within the company and add a communication training to address the problems.</seg>
<seg id="2255">In Ruby Tuesday, the company gets new insights into the employees, and it hopes that in the long run, this leads to a better engagement of employees in a sector that is known for high turnover.</seg>

<seg id="2265">The NCAA eliminates two-day exercises to ease the load of the players, and she has actually extended her days - at least until the final on Friday.</seg>
<seg id="2266">For this reason, the first three training sessions of the UCLA should begin at 7: 15 p.m. in order to meet the already packed timetables of the players.</seg>
<seg id="2267">The compromise between the two days is more than a day at which the Bruins postponed the start of the camp almost a week after the last season and during the summer school for the first time during Moras performing six playing times in Westwood practical exercises.</seg>

<seg id="2290">Creating a comic novel: a castle in the history of England</seg>
<seg id="2291">In his recent past, the little Scotney castle was to be seen in a squeeze music video and was a loophole for Margaret Thatcher in the 1970's and 1980's.</seg>
<seg id="2292">But Scotney has experienced 700 years of turbulent history from his comfortable seat in the Irl River valley in Kent and now has become an inspiration for a graphic novel by Jamie Rhodes, a cosmopolitan Yorkshireman with a preference for historical documents.</seg>
<seg id="2293">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "I think it's so nice to look at the handwriting of someone who has been dead for 300 years," "" "" "" "he says boldly." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2294">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "what a personal relationship to hold this letter in my hand." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2295">'A Castle in England 'spans the time from the Middle Ages to the age of Edward and documents the families living in Scotney. each story was illustrated by another, emerging British artist - Isaac Steiewicz, William Exley, Becky Palmer and Isabel Greenberg.</seg>
<seg id="2296">It is not the first book of Rhodes, which is based on an archive: it wrote in 2014 'Dead Men's Teeth and Other Stories', a collection inspired by documents in the British Library - a project that he found unexpectedly emotional.</seg>
<seg id="2297">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "I only reacted to the thumbprint on the side of a letter that was written by a double agent in the 1700" s "" "" "", "he says." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2298">"this is his thumb-print!</seg>
<seg id="2299">And letters always smell of smoke, for at that time a fire was kindled because of the light.</seg>
<seg id="2300">For someone who lives 300 years later, the smell has an effect as if he were himself.</seg>
<seg id="2301">Oh, I love archives! "</seg>
<seg id="2302">For someone who is so beaten with old papers that he is supported by the National Trust and the Arts Council England and lived almost four months in a castle ("To be honest: I have overrated my Welcome-greeting a little") seems to be all too beautiful to be true.</seg>
<seg id="2303">Rhodes spent his days exploring the Victorian "new" castle, viewing the archives, and studying the many treasures and curiosities of the castle, such as the moons of hyena on the walls and the bottles that had spent centuries in the ditch.</seg>
<seg id="2304">He wandered through the grounds and the ruins of the old castle and spoke with landscape care, gardening and sometimes with the artists who worked on the illustrations of his book.</seg>
<seg id="2305">Then at night he drank "Whiskey and started to write."</seg>
<seg id="2306">The intimate history of Scotney is relatively unknown, as the National Trust gained full access only in 2006, when the last heir, Elizabeth Hussey, died.</seg>
<seg id="2307">When Rhodes arrived a decade later, the employees began to take care of the archive, which he described as "hundreds of years in which aristocrats said," Oh, cast it down on the attic. "</seg>
<seg id="2308">Diaries, letters from the time of the English Empire, cards that represent what possessed it: "one could think that land conflicts would be boring," says Rhodes, "but there was a birch fighting the two families.</seg>
<seg id="2309">Guys, let's go all the way! "</seg>
<seg id="2310">Some of the stories in the collection use the castle as a starting point to immerse themselves in English history, among them 'The Labourer', who follows a man who leaves the newly built castle to join the peasant uprising of 1381.</seg>
<seg id="2311">"there is a record of a rebellion, which appeared in the castle in 1380, in this book titled 'Knightly Families of Kent and Sussex', says Rhodes.</seg>
<seg id="2312">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "the peasant uprising began in this area and I thought that an insurrection was a good start." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2313">"" "" "" "maybe they are connected with each other?" "" "" "" "" "" "</seg>
<seg id="2314">Other stories are firmly rooted in the history of the castle - like 'The Priest', which tells the story of the Jesuit Pattern that the Darrell family hid for seven years during the English Reformation.</seg>
<seg id="2315">Or 'The Smuggler', in which the smuggler Arthur Darrell was portrayed from the 18th century, who staged his own funeral by filling a coffin with stones (a discovery that was made only years later when his coffin was excavated).</seg>
<seg id="2316">The darrells are Rhodes' favorite family of Scotney: "the gentlemen seemed to be quite Gauner, always making debts and spending money on things they could not afford.</seg>
<seg id="2317">Other generations of Darrell men solved their debt crisis by marrying rich old women - I imagine them as a heap of well-looking boys, with a talent to promote landlords. "</seg>
<seg id="2318">After the end of his use in the castle Rhodes is searching for other unique writing experiences</seg>
<seg id="2319">He has spent a two week stay in the Finnish wilderness for a comic novel about Elämäki, the terrain of a sanatorium from the early 20th century, which has since been reclaimed by nature.</seg>
<seg id="2320">But Scotney has a special place for him.</seg>

<seg id="2337">Military reforms in Turkey - Erdogan's fear of the army</seg>
<seg id="2338">Every year at the beginning of August, the Supreme Military Council (YAS) consults in Ankara on retirements and promotions in the officer corps.</seg>
<seg id="2339">So also this week.</seg>
<seg id="2340">At first glance, a normal process.</seg>
<seg id="2341">But nothing is routine in the Turkish armed forces one year after attempted coup attempt.</seg>
<seg id="2342">The meeting was held no longer in the building of the General Staff, as previously, but in the presidency of the Prime Minister.</seg>
<seg id="2343">At the meetings of the Heads of State, the five Vice-Presidents and the Minister for Defence, Home Affairs, Justice and Foreign Affairs took part in the discussions.</seg>
<seg id="2344">Thus, the civilians in the YAS were in number.</seg>
<seg id="2345">The government is pulling the reins in the military.</seg>
<seg id="2346">The Chief of Staff, Hulusi Akar, remains in office, but the officers of the army, the forces of air and the Navy were dismissed.</seg>
<seg id="2347">Since the failed coup, President Erdogan 169 has fired the 326 generals and admirals.</seg>
<seg id="2348">More than 10,000 soldiers were removed from the ranks of the army - mostly because of alleged connections to the movement of the exile preacher Fethullah Gülen, the Erdogan as a wireagent of the coup attempt.</seg>
<seg id="2349">Against 486 people who were allegedly involved in the coup attempt, Ankara has been negotiating in Ankara since that week.</seg>
<seg id="2350">Already on the day after the coup, Erdogan had called the crash test as a "gift of God," because he gave him the opportunity to "completely clean up the armed forces."</seg>
<seg id="2351">But does Erdogan really get a grip on the army?</seg>
<seg id="2352">At the end of February, the newspaper Hürriyet published an article entitled "Discomfort in Military Headquarters."</seg>
<seg id="2353">In the General Staff, there are concerns about an increasing "Islamization" of the army, which, among other things, manifests itself in the abolition of the prohibition of security for soldiers, wrote the newspaper.</seg>
<seg id="2354">In any case, the army and security forces in the army and the security forces continue.</seg>
<seg id="2355">In mid-July, Erdogan decreed another 7395 civil servants, including 2303 policemen and 546 soldiers.</seg>
<seg id="2356">It seemed that Erdogan had tamed the military.</seg>
<seg id="2357">The generals were earlier than the actual lords of the country.</seg>
<seg id="2358">Three times, they putted their role as guardians of the secular state order.</seg>
<seg id="2359">After his election victory in 2002, Erdogan pushed back the power of the military step by step, not least on appeal to the reform requirements of the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2360">Former officers say that Erdogan is systematically driving an Islamization of the armed forces.</seg>
<seg id="2361">In the magazine "Vocal Europe," a particularly unnamed officer, who sought asylum after the attempted coup attempt to seek asylum abroad, would be "full of extremists and Salafists" in a few years.</seg>
<seg id="2362">If this is true, NATO could not leave NATO cold.</seg>
<seg id="2363">Anyway, in the alliance after cleansing, there are doubts about the operational readiness of the Turkish army.</seg>

<seg id="2368">The new rules are proposed by the Republicans and supported by the President.</seg>

<seg id="2373">Ministry wants to rehabilitate track for race shuttle</seg>
<seg id="2374">Over and over the past few months have been arguing about the future of the race shuttle - now it should be quite fast.</seg>
<seg id="2375">Before the end of the year, it is planned to build on the ailing route on which the tourist railway runs.</seg>
<seg id="2376">In order to secure the future of the race shuttle in the long term, construction works will begin on the track even this year, according to the Ministry of Transport.</seg>
<seg id="2377">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "with the decision to further order and renovate the track Ilmenau-Rennsteig, the country is committing itself to this particularly important link," "" "" "" "stated traffic state secretary Klaus Punl on Friday in Erfurt." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="2379">The country took 75 percent of this sum.</seg>
<seg id="2380">The agreement, based on which the shuttle is to be ordered by the country in the future, is currently in agreement, declared expiation.</seg>

<seg id="2383">The planned contract between the ministry and the railway company will be closed for a period of eleven years.</seg>
<seg id="2384">This means that the racing platform shuttle will be ordered regularly in December 2017.</seg>
<seg id="2385">The racing platform shuttle is a popular rail link between the Ilmenau and Rennsteig railway stations.</seg>
<seg id="2386">In the course of a pilot operation in the past few months, it has been tested whether the route is used by a large number of people to order them regularly in the future.</seg>
<seg id="2387">The track is also in parts strongly dilapidated.</seg>
<seg id="2388">The rise of sex robots is real, and we should be worried</seg>
<seg id="2389">Just as you thought that 2017 can't be even more crazy, a new report about technological developments in the field of sex robots.</seg>
<seg id="2390">Yes, actually.</seg>
<seg id="2391">Sex robots are currently one big thing.</seg>
<seg id="2392">Recently, the Foundation for Responsible Robotics (FRR) published a report on the development of sex robots in the next five to ten years.</seg>
<seg id="2393">According to Noel Sharkey, Professor of Robotics and Artificial Intelligence at the University of Sheffield and co-founder of the FRR, we must start taking their ascension seriously.</seg>
<seg id="2394">Customers can choose the eye color of the robot, its shape of the nipple and the type of finger nail.</seg>
<seg id="2395">"people make fun of them, but the companies deliver a lot of it and we will see them much more frequently," said Mr. Sharkey at the publication of his new report.</seg>
<seg id="2396">Modern sex dolls have developed from their inflatable partners to robots with a silicone skin that feels warm - with consciously human reactions that are achieved by artificial intelligence.</seg>
<seg id="2397">The user can also "adapt" his robot according to his convictions and select everything from the eye colour of the robot via the shape of the nipples to the type or color of his fingernails.</seg>
<seg id="2398">But it will be more disturbing, as many robots have the "personalities" that would make a stepford woman look progressive.</seg>
<seg id="2399">Modern sex dolls have developed into robots with a silicone skin.</seg>
<seg id="2400">The RealBotix robot, for example, enables its users to adapt their robots to the properties that they find appealing like, for example, shyness.</seg>
<seg id="2401">And then there is the Roxxxy gold sex-robot developed by True Companion with pre-programmed personalities such as "Frigid Farrah" that gives the impression of shyness and "Wild Wendy" with an "adventurous" personality.</seg>
<seg id="2402">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "Roxxxy Gold has a personality which is adapted to your personality as well as possible," "" "" "" "heats the website of True Companion." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2403">So they like what you like, and they don't like what you don't like, etc.</seg>
<seg id="2404">She also has her moods in the course of the day - just like real people!</seg>
<seg id="2405">She can be tired, fixed on conversation, or she can "be in tune"! "</seg>
<seg id="2406">There are many disturbing aspects of this rise of sex robots - not least because they replace real human relationships - but the submissive female features, the allusions to rape, when one goes a step on Frigid (means here: reluctant) Farrah, upset one of the most.</seg>
<seg id="2407">On his website, True Companion Roxxxy with a vibrator but for men.</seg>
<seg id="2408">"if women (sic) can have a vibrator then why can men then have no Roxxxy?" is it on the website?</seg>
<seg id="2409">However, these sex robots are not just a fetish or just a different sex toy.</seg>
<seg id="2410">Their emergence and increasing sophistication point to something dark and deeper in our culture, to a retreat from the ideal of gender equality towards a desire for sex with submission as an optional encore.</seg>
<seg id="2411">Most men will naturally not hold sex robots, and while the FRR notices their rising popularity, they still remain at the edge of consumer culture.</seg>
<seg id="2412">But what seeps out of the fringes can be very instructive regarding the spirit of the time we live in.</seg>
<seg id="2413">And many people are not strange or insulting until the free market for this is given permission.</seg>
<seg id="2414">There is a certain overlap that these highly developed sex robots emerge at a time in which women's rights are threatened all over the world, in which there is a president in the White House who has boasted to have attacked women sexually.</seg>
<seg id="2415">The most deterrent aspect of the TV series' The Hand-maid's Tale '(' The report of the maid ') is not the graphic pictures, the intricate body and the bursting eyes, but how realistic this vision works.</seg>
<seg id="2416">The Republic of Gilead is a leap, but at the moment this does not feel like a big jump.</seg>
<seg id="2417">The goal behind these sex robots is to produce a physical likeness to actual women as realistic as technically possible (albeit with pornostar proportions).</seg>
<seg id="2418">Their builders want them to feel human that they imitate the movement of a real body.</seg>
<seg id="2419">But, when it comes to "personalities," the robots are not real women.</seg>
<seg id="2420">They cannot separate themselves from their companion or simply go away.</seg>
<seg id="2421">They do not have a mediation or a background story, nothing that points to independence or anything that could interfere with the fantasy of total submission.</seg>
<seg id="2422">In other words, they are fake slaves.</seg>
<seg id="2423">Or to express it in the Redemption of 2017: maid</seg>
<seg id="2424">Trumps great performance?</seg>
<seg id="2425">He makes Mitt Romney the epitome of common sense of man</seg>
<seg id="2426">It has become a rush of the Trump-era that the political divisions polarized by the US voters have split even families in small format.</seg>
<seg id="2427">Around Christmas and Thanksgiving there were newspapers in the USA with advice about how to deal with the horror of Trump-choosing relatives.</seg>
<seg id="2428">We all claim to burst our filter bags.</seg>
<seg id="2429">Less noticed is the power of Trumps to bring together families.</seg>
<seg id="2430">I mention this because my cousin, a left-looking poet, who lives in Chicago and has long been working with the republicans in our family, visited me this week in New York.</seg>
<seg id="2431">She reminded me that unity against a common enemy can have a powerful effect.</seg>
<seg id="2432">With Trump in the White House, everyone whom she knows, including the republican relationship with which she had fought for decades on account of politics, is suddenly and quite strange on the same side.</seg>
<seg id="2433">This is certainly a good thing around the dining table, but it is in a further context that this also brings considerable risks.</seg>
<seg id="2434">The left was strengthened by Trump, but the decisive action of his presidency has the power to push us all to the right.</seg>
<seg id="2435">When we speak of "normalisation" and Trump, we refer to the grumpy possibility that his kittens will no longer run away.</seg>
<seg id="2436">However, there is an even more difficult long-term scenario in which Trump Republicans of the right wing are "normalized," which suddenly appear as the notion of reasonableness in comparison with his standards.</seg>
<seg id="2437">I find myself today of an active nostalgia for Mitt Romney's original version of the mad - the dog on the car roof, the 14% income tax (but at least we knew how his tax return looked) - both in fact seem to be a very mild criminal offence.</seg>
<seg id="2438">When Trump goes, the next candidate of the Republicans must be only spiritually healthy in order to qualify as an immeasurable improvement.</seg>
<seg id="2439">When my cousin was in the city, we brought our children to the carousel in Central Park, the largest of the carousels of the New York park department, and the best three dollars you can spend in the city if you don't need a caffeine.</seg>
<seg id="2440">The horses are enormously large, the fiberglass designs on the central cylinder - all clowns are credulous and the animals turn to look full of fear about their own shoulders - extremely dark and the climating music imparts this in a strange way.</seg>
<seg id="2441">So many clichés of a city disappoint: the views of tall buildings become old, the skylines become familiar to offer much excitement, and the reality of the city will not do justice to the dream.</seg>
<seg id="2442">Thirty-five years later, and I am still not quite over the day when I found that Swiss Cottage is indeed not a Swiss Cottage - the themed pub Ye Olde Swiss Cottage does not count - but a large roundabout in the north of London.</seg>
<seg id="2443">The Central Park carousel is still a strangely magical experience as two two-year-olds, a 11-year-old and two women in the 40 "s can go on it and all have a great time.</seg>
<seg id="2444">If I could have evaluated the carousel, I would have given him the full score, but luckily no one asked afterwards.</seg>
<seg id="2445">On the other hand, I was forced into a department store this week to evaluate my "experience" with transactions on a scale of one to five stars before I could pass my credit card.</seg>
<seg id="2446">In the coffee house at the corner of my street it is the same, plus the option to balance the rating with a 15% tip - this to buy something over the counter.</seg>
<seg id="2447">This not only leads to a slowdown of what should be a neutral exchange, but also exerts pressure on the server to bring personality into a situation in which none is required.</seg>
<seg id="2448">The poor woman in the department store was apologizing, while I was tired of the experience to give her my credit card with five stars.</seg>
<seg id="2449">Oscar Pistorius with chest pain transferred from prison to hospital</seg>
<seg id="2450">For the second time, Pistorius left the prison for a hospital visit.</seg>
<seg id="2451">Last year he was brought to hospital for the treatment of cuts to his wrist, according to the prison authorities, according to a case in his cell.</seg>
<seg id="2452">Pistorius was sentenced to a first death sentence for murder following an appeal by the prosecutors.</seg>
<seg id="2453">He killed Steenkamp in the early morning hours of Valentine's Day by firing them several times through a door of the toilet cabin in his house in Pretoria.</seg>
<seg id="2454">Pistorius claimed that he kept his girlfriend for a nighttime intruder, hiding in the cabin.</seg>
<seg id="2455">The prosecutors have announced their intention to appeal this time to the six-year prison sentence of Pistorius Appeal, of which they say that it is too indulgent.</seg>
<seg id="2456">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "the national law enforcement agency said that it will appeal to the Supreme Court of South Africa and the appeal could be heard this year." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2457">Pistorius is at risk that his sentence will be increased to 15 years if the prosecutors are successful.</seg>

<seg id="2459">When farmer Arnold finds a strange egg</seg>
<seg id="2460">As the last of the Blumberger schools, the four-door-dependants were discharged from caps and boilers in the holidays and in the secondary schools.</seg>
<seg id="2461">Three of the students will go to secondary school in the future, four to the secondary school.</seg>
<seg id="2462">On Tuesday evening school director Angelika Sitte welcomed the parents and representatives of the public in the Bürgerhaus Biesental in Epfenhofen.</seg>
<seg id="2463">The 29 students of the four classes, under the leadership of Sophia Schumacher and Regine Meder, chose a young eagle, who grows up in the poultry farm, but then released to freedom.</seg>
<seg id="2464">The lower band performed a musical with the title "The Eagle in the chicken farm."</seg>
<seg id="2465">Farmer Arnold found a strange egg, and left it from his chickens.</seg>
<seg id="2466">Instead of a chicken kens, a small eagle came out.</seg>
<seg id="2467">But the hope of making a chicken out of it smashed, the eagle wiped out its wings on a high mountain and swept away.</seg>
<seg id="2468">Then the classes showed three and four in the studio of Yvonne Frank a chicken tanker.</seg>
<seg id="2469">The hens danced with the young Gockeln, the cylinders worn to the bet.</seg>
<seg id="2470">The eagle stands for the integration, said school director Angelika Sitte.</seg>
<seg id="2471">The kitten may be different from the other kittens (chicks), but belongs to it.</seg>
<seg id="2472">But he will never be like a chicken.</seg>
<seg id="2473">His determination is to be free.</seg>
<seg id="2474">She wished everyone four-year-old that he feels accepted in his new school.</seg>
<seg id="2475">This was followed by a message of thanks to the colleagues, the former school manager Michael Müller, who always jumps in with teaching bottlenecks, and the parents "representatives.</seg>
<seg id="2476">The time of the cucumber was over, said class teacher Sophia Schumacher.</seg>
<seg id="2477">She only reluctantly leaves her students very reluctant after two years, because it had been a really great time.</seg>
<seg id="2478">Finally, they can rely on the four-door dependants.</seg>
<seg id="2479">At the end all students let a song of summer time and holiday season sounded.</seg>

<seg id="2491">How exactly does the software update take place?</seg>
<seg id="2492">Do diesel drivers need to participate in the action?</seg>
<seg id="2493">An overview of the most important questions and answers.</seg>
<seg id="2494">At the diesel summit, BMW, Daimler, Opel and the VW Group have offered software updates for a total of approximately 5.3 million cars.</seg>
<seg id="2495">They aim to improve the emission behaviour of cars in the emissions categories Euro 5 and some Euro 6.</seg>
<seg id="2496">Euro-4 diesel or worse are excluded.</seg>
<seg id="2497">Anja Smetanin from ACE Auto Club Europe gives assessments:</seg>
<seg id="2498">Is the new action mandatory?</seg>
<seg id="2499">No, the software updates negotiated are voluntary.</seg>
<seg id="2500">"the mandatory updates are only valid for vehicles that have authored software," says Anja Smetanin.</seg>
<seg id="2501">The German Federal Office of Technology (KBA) has ordered its retrofitting.</seg>
<seg id="2502">How and when will customers be informed about updates?</seg>
<seg id="2503">The manufacturers have announced rapid implementation over the next few months, but they have not yet known an exact date.</seg>
<seg id="2504">Daimler has informed that Daimler had to write to each person affected.</seg>
<seg id="2505">If an inspection is due in any case, it will be carried out within the framework.</seg>
<seg id="2506">How long will the retrofitting be extended altogether?</seg>
<seg id="2507">"hard to say," says Smetanin.</seg>
<seg id="2508">This depends on the commitment of the manufacturers as well as from political pressure.</seg>
<seg id="2509">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "because we have seen, the car manufacturers do not act voluntarily on the environment so far." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2510">How long should the update last?</seg>
<seg id="2511">The retrofitting could last only three to four hours in the workshop.</seg>
<seg id="2512">Time consuming can be to get an appointment.</seg>
<seg id="2513">What do drivers do, who do not drive a car from BMW, Daimler, Opel and the VW group?</seg>
<seg id="2514">The ACE advises to wait.</seg>
<seg id="2515">Presumably foreign manufacturers would prefer Smetanin.</seg>
<seg id="2516">Is there a massive price fall of Euro-4 cars?</seg>
<seg id="2517">The ACE is afraid of that.</seg>
<seg id="2518">But just in the regions where driving prohibitions threaten.</seg>
<seg id="2519">So far there is no loss of value for older diesel in the rural area.</seg>
<seg id="2520">The ACE advises to wait with a sale.</seg>

<seg id="2579">Red meat, dairy products and chocolate might help alleviate IBD (inflammatory bowel disease)</seg>
<seg id="2580">Red meat and chocolate may sound like a nightmare for your digestive system.</seg>
<seg id="2581">But a new study claims exactly the opposite: a diet rich in meat-based proteins and dairy products could alleviate the symptoms of patients with inflammatory bowel disease.</seg>
<seg id="2582">The incurable condition, which affects approximately 1.3 million in the United States and 300,000 in the United States, causes stomach cramps and flatulence, recurrent or bloody diarrhoea, weight loss, and extreme fatigue.</seg>
<seg id="2583">While those affected are usually advised to avoid meat and dairy products to alleviate their symptoms, researchers found at the Washington University that the essential amino acid tryptophan contributes to proteins to develop immune cells that promote a tolerant intestine.</seg>
<seg id="2584">The senior researcher, Dr. Marco Colonna, stated that immune cells patrol in the gut to ensure that harmful microbes hiding in the food do not penetrate the body.</seg>
<seg id="2585">Cells capable of triggering inflammation are compensated by cells that promote tolerance and protect the body without damaging sensitive tissues.</seg>
<seg id="2586">If the equilibrium tends to be too far in the direction of inflammation, it can result in inflammatory bowel disease.</seg>
<seg id="2587">In experiments it was found that a type of tolerance-promoting immune cell is found in mice carrying a specific bacterium in their intestines.</seg>
<seg id="2588">And the bacterium needs tryptophan - one of the building blocks of proteins - to trigger the appearance of the cells.</seg>
<seg id="2589">Professor Colonna said: "we have a connection between a species of bacteria - Lactobacillus reuteri - which is a normal part of the gut microbiome, and the development of a population of cells that promote tolerance.</seg>
<seg id="2590">The more tryptophan the mice had in their food, the more they had from these immune cells. "</seg>
<seg id="2591">He suggested that the combination of L. reuteri and a diet tolerant of tryptophan contributes to tolerant, less inflammatory bowel milieus if the same system works also in humans.</seg>
<seg id="2592">The post-doctoral candidate Dr. Luisa Cervantes-Barragan examined a type of immune cell that promotes tolerance when she found out that a group of study mice had such cells, but another group of the same family, who had been accommodated separately, did not have this.</seg>
<seg id="2593">She suspected that the difference with the intestinal microbial cells of mice had to do - the community of bacteria, viruses and fungi, which normally live in the gastrointestinal tract.</seg>
<seg id="2594">The intestines of mice were sequenced and six bacterial species found that were present in mice with the immune cells, but were missing in mice.</seg>
<seg id="2595">Mice were raised in a sterile environment, so that an intestinal microbiome was missing and they did not develop this type of immune cells and they received the L. reuteri and the immune cells.</seg>
<seg id="2596">In order to understand how the bacteria worked on the immune system, the researchers L. reuteri spread in a liquid and then transferred small amounts of the liquid - without the bacteria - on immature immune cells isolated from the mice.</seg>
<seg id="2597">The immune cells developed into the tolerant cells.</seg>
<seg id="2598">When the active component was purified from the liquid, it turned out to be a byproduct of tryptophan metabolism, known as an idol-3 lactic acid.</seg>
<seg id="2599">When the researchers doubled the amount of tryptophan in mice's feed, the number of cells increased by about 50 percent, but when tryptophan was halved, the number of cells decreased by half.</seg>
<seg id="2600">Dr. Cervantes-Barragan declared that people have the same tolerant cells as mice, and that most of us protect L. reuteri in our gastrointestinal tracts.</seg>
<seg id="2601">It is not known whether tryptophan auxiliary products from L. reuteri develop the cells in humans as in mice, but defects in genes related to tryptophan have been found in people with inflammatory bowel disease.</seg>
<seg id="2602">"" "" "" "she said," "" "" "" "the development of these cells is probably something we want to promote, as these cells control inflammation on the inner surface of the intestines." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2603">Potentially high tryptophan values can lead to an extension of this population in the presence of L. reuteri. "</seg>

<seg id="2722">The note adds that if the departure from the White House should be delayed due to the limitation of the service hours a second crew would be required for the return flight.</seg>

<seg id="2724">From the records provided by the TIME, it was not clear whether a second flight crew was required.</seg>
<seg id="2725">The Hatch Act forbids federal employees to use state property for political purposes.</seg>

<seg id="2888">Interview: "Domspatzen report relieves Pope brother Georg Ratzinger"</seg>
<seg id="2889">The Regensburger Domspatzen Report on the misuse cases relieves Pope brother Georg Ratzinger.</seg>
<seg id="2890">This is what author and historian Michael Hesemann believes.</seg>
<seg id="2891">The final report on the misuse scandal at the Regensburger Domspatzen provides further discussion.</seg>
<seg id="2892">Christian Weisnder, spokesman for the reform movement "We are Church," declared after publication in front of the Deutsche Presse-Agentur, he acquired an apology from the former Regensburg Bishop and present-day Cardinal Gerhard Ludwig Müller as well as by the Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger, the 93-year-old brother of the Pope Benedict XVI.</seg>
<seg id="2893">It would serve the reputation of the Catholic Church greatly if Müller and Ratzinger expressed their deep regret about their own omissions or their false appraisal of the processes at that time.</seg>
<seg id="2894">On the other hand, the Vatican newspaper "Osservatore Romano" criticized the fact that in the reporting of violence in the domains of the cathedral, "double standards" were measured.</seg>
<seg id="2895">With regard to the assaults in Regensburg nobody doubts that it is "shameful and shameful acts," which should be punished and prevented in the future. however, the "degree of medial manipulation," says the author Lucetta Scaraffia, historian and member of the national Italian Bioethics committee.</seg>
<seg id="2896">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "the habit of denouncing the Catholic Church as a source of all evils is already part of everyday life and prepares public opinion to keep it normal," "" "" "" "writes Scaraffia." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2897">Princess Gloria von Thurn und Taxis also said in an interview with Bayerischer Rundfunk: "you like to go to the church and that's a frozen food."</seg>
<seg id="2898">She also pointed out that "strokes were a very normal educational tool" in their youth, "in order to cope with cheeky children, as I was one."</seg>
<seg id="2899">They find it unfair to apply today's standards to previous decades, as the world has changed.</seg>
<seg id="2900">In connection with the reports on misuse cases, pope-brother Georg Ratzinger often appeared.</seg>
<seg id="2901">Fully justified, author and historian Michael Hesemann, who wrote with Ratzinger the "My Brother of the Pope" (translated into 12 languages).</seg>
<seg id="2902">"I have to take refuge in Georg Ratzinger," says Hesemann, "because all this had nothing to do with him," he analyses the results of the final report.</seg>
<seg id="2903">What exactly is the 440-page report commissioned by the Bistum Regensburg with the Enlightenment attorney Ulrich Weber?</seg>
<seg id="2904">A total of 547 Regensburger Domspatzen were sexually abused between 1945 and the beginning of the 1990s "with high plausibility."</seg>
<seg id="2905">In the final report it is called Georg Ratzinger, who worked in Regensburg from 1964 to 1994: "in summary, the fact that Domkapellmeister R. was used in many cases of physical and psychological violence.</seg>
<seg id="2906">Especially with a high level of emotionality, the punishment for the students was even more severe.</seg>
<seg id="2907">However, in contrast to numerous other allegations, many victims have estimated the general humanity of R. and, in many cases, even combine positive memories with him in many cases. "</seg>
<seg id="2908">In the interview, Hesemann explains why the final report on the misuse scandal at the Regensburger Domspatzen Georg Ratzinger is relieved of his opinion.</seg>
<seg id="2909">Mr Hesemann, the 440-page report on the "incidents of violent exercise on protective animals in the Regensburger Domspatzen" gives a contradictory picture of Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger.</seg>
<seg id="2910">For one, many students emphasize his "humanity."</seg>
<seg id="2911">On the other hand, it also appears as a choleriker and perfectionist, who has become hand-grasped by the Öfteren when a domain record musically did not bring any top performance.</seg>
<seg id="2912">How do you evaluate this final report as his biographer?</seg>
<seg id="2913">Michael Hesemann: if you take the trouble and read the whole 440 pages long report from the front to the back, you have to ask yourself why the name Georg Ratzinger appears at all in it.</seg>
<seg id="2914">He is even dedicated to eight pages and he is clearly exempted from any suspicion of complicity or complicity in the terrible cases of sexual abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2915">The excesses of violence at the preschool also took place outside of his sphere of work.</seg>
<seg id="2916">At best, one can reproach him, learn from it too late or not have taken the first hints seriously enough.</seg>
<seg id="2917">The physical gymnasium, on which he worked, was perceived as literally "redemption," "heaven" and "better world."</seg>
<seg id="2918">The vast majority of his students, Georg Ratzinger, also exemplifies an excellent testimony, describes him as "warm hearted," "sincere," "competent," and "understanding," as extremely good-natured teachers, who supplied the boys regularly with cakes, biscuits and candy and "always surrounded by grapes of children."</seg>
<seg id="2919">Only a minority complains about its perfectionism and its high emotionality, which has also led to hernia.</seg>
<seg id="2920">The fact that he did not only bang with chairs and threw the keyring on the ground, but also put ear-cowards distributed and too naughty boys to the hair or ears, he himself had admitted years ago, deeply regrets and apologized for it.</seg>
<seg id="2921">To its salvation, however, it must be said that such educational methods were widespread in the period in question, the 1960s and 1970s, with parents as with teachers.</seg>
<seg id="2922">Do you know such methods of breeding?</seg>
<seg id="2923">Of course, I think each of us who was born before 1968.</seg>
<seg id="2924">I also experienced this in a secular school, a state gymnasium.</seg>
<seg id="2925">Compared to what is actually going on in this report, namely the horrific sexual abuse and violent excesses at the preschool, these are admittedly dreatballs.</seg>
<seg id="2926">One wonders whether it is not with his familiarity and his role as brother of Benedict XVI that many media have just rushed to him.</seg>
<seg id="2927">Many who have never understood him are still working diligently in the Bavarian pope.</seg>
<seg id="2928">But the truth is: the report relieves Georg Ratzinger in every respect!</seg>
<seg id="2929">The media reported a great deal about the abuse of the Regensburger Domspatzen.</seg>
<seg id="2930">In the final report, Georg Ratzinger is also charged with any involvement or involvement with regard to sexual abuse?</seg>
<seg id="2931">Michael Hesemann: clearly no.</seg>
<seg id="2932">Not a single of the 67 victims of sexual assault claims to be entrusted to the Domkapellmeister.</seg>
<seg id="2933">Not even the parents were inaugurated.</seg>
<seg id="2934">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "I never dared to talk about it with my father or my mother," "" "" "" "said an affected person for the others," "" "" "" "It was all very embarrassing to me." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2935">The real problem in the clarification of sexual abuse was and is, however, that most victims are silent.</seg>
<seg id="2936">If they were not even familiar with parents and siblings, it would not be a choral director who would have been a colleague of the culprits.</seg>
<seg id="2937">How do the Domspatzen students evaluate Ratzinger's role in terms of misuse cases?</seg>
<seg id="2938">Michael Hesemann: a dubious student formulated it like this: "regarding sexual abuse... I see... no case in which he (Georg Ratzinger) had had timely findings and could have been able to stop the respective perpetrator.</seg>
<seg id="2939">I think it... also for really absurd to assume that... Buben have opened themselves more intrusive and clear or even more open than to their parents, dormitory managers, trust teachers, etc.</seg>
<seg id="2940">That one speaks with him about sex... - thinkable. "</seg>
<seg id="2941">"" "" "" "this is how the report concludes with the clear result:" "" "" "" "that in the run-up affected students and / or their environment, could not be confirmed in the course of the investigation." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2942">As far as sexual abuse is concerned, Georg Ratzinger is thus free to speak of any co-worker.</seg>
<seg id="2943">Thus it cannot be accused of preventing it or bringing it to the ad.</seg>
<seg id="2944">Therefore, there is no reason to associate his good name with these crimes against him, as happened in some cases.</seg>
<seg id="2945">In the media much of "violent eating" was to be read at the Regensburger Domspatzen.</seg>
<seg id="2946">The former Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger is thrown into the report "Look at."</seg>
<seg id="2947">Does he have to live with this reproach?</seg>
<seg id="2948">Michael Hesemann: this is the big problem that everything is mixed and mixed up in the coverage of a huge melange of sexual abuse and violence and somewhere, in the middle of it, Georg Ratzinger.</seg>
<seg id="2949">But that is, in turn, a misuse of the report.</seg>
<seg id="2950">There is a clean separation: between the preschool and the gymnasium of the domain pads, between sexual abuse and violent excesses as well as, let's say, other allegations.</seg>
<seg id="2951">In addition, the report deals with incidents from the period since 1945, thus also from four decades in which Georg Ratzinger was not choir director of the Domspatzen.</seg>
<seg id="2952">The whole horrible test pedagogy, the cases in which the boys of sadistic teachers were misguided and maligned and suffered terribly, all took place at the pre-school in Etterzhausen and Pielenhofen, where really scandalous conditions had to prevail.</seg>
<seg id="2953">But with whom Domkapellmeister had nothing to do with Georg Ratzinger, because he only got the boy to face when they were already at the Domasatzenggyasium.</seg>
<seg id="2954">On this was, as most witnesses pointed out, the subject of "pre-school" taboo.</seg>
<seg id="2955">You were only happy to be able to escape and enjoyed the much better treatment and for many even "heavenly" conditions.</seg>
<seg id="2956">What was different in the gymnasium?</seg>
<seg id="2957">Michael Hesemann: there was discipline already, but no sadistic force.</seg>
<seg id="2958">And this is also true for Georg Ratzinger, in which the report concludes that "many victims appreciated the general humanity of R. and, in many cases, even combine positive memories with him in numerous cases."</seg>
<seg id="2959">At most, the blame remains to be taken away.</seg>
<seg id="2960">But despite all efforts, the report could only define two periods in which it was reported by the states at the preschool.</seg>
<seg id="2961">The first time in 1970 / 71, when he began to establish himself and from the events at a school where he was not working and was responsible, (so the witness) did not want to hear anything, and then again in 1993.</seg>
<seg id="2962">Did Georg Ratzinger consistently shut the ears in front of the states?</seg>
<seg id="2963">Michael Hesemann: no, because in 1989 he wrote a letter to the director of the physical gymnasium, who even reproduced the report.</seg>
<seg id="2964">"" "" "" "in this he points out this," "" "" "" "that in the pre-school the auditing penalty will continue to be practised." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2965">In view of the danger of negative press reviews, he recommended an urgent intervention.</seg>
<seg id="2966">This was, of course, at a time when legal clarity existed, as auditing punishments were forbidden in Bavaria long ago.</seg>
<seg id="2967">Before that, they took place in a legal grey area, as each of us probably knows.</seg>
<seg id="2968">It was difficult for him to guess where the persons affected might be exaggerated or dramatised and where really the permissible limit had been exceeded.</seg>
<seg id="2969">But you can't say that he has always looked away.</seg>
<seg id="2970">That's just not right.</seg>
<seg id="2971">Only in 1980, the testing of schools in Bavaria was officially abolished.</seg>
<seg id="2972">Princess Gloria von Thurn und Taxis insisted that it is unfair to apply today's educational standards to the time of that time.</seg>
<seg id="2973">How do you see that?</seg>
<seg id="2974">Michael Hesemann: we historians speak of the "snare of anachronism," i.e. the danger of evaluating the past according to today's moral standards.</seg>
<seg id="2975">The princess has already been right.</seg>
<seg id="2976">But this is of course not true for sexual abuse, which was detrimental at all times, and not for what was broken at the pre-school of adversity and violence against innocent children's souls, that goes far beyond the usual practice.</seg>
<seg id="2977">This is all horrible and I am glad that it will finally be reconditioned.</seg>
<seg id="2978">But at the same time I have to take refuge in Georg Ratzinger, because all that had nothing to do with him.</seg>
<seg id="2979">Its means for disciplining and punishment, i.e. to pull ear-cowards and to the hair and ears, were widespread in the 1970s.</seg>
<seg id="2980">When physical punishment was then forbidden, it has kept strict adherence to it.</seg>
<seg id="2981">What picture of his Regensburg time has Georg Ratzinger reproduced in the talks with you for the book "My Brother of the Pope"?</seg>
<seg id="2982">Did the subject of auditing also come to language?</seg>
<seg id="2983">Michael Hesemann: well, in the book it is about the life of his brother Joseph, thus Pope Benedict XVI, tells from his perspective that the Domspatzen played only a minor role.</seg>
<seg id="2984">Nevertheless, I do not deviate from the fact that he led a strict regiment there.</seg>
<seg id="2985">But even this must be said once: without this perfectionism, without demanding discipline, it would hardly have been possible for him to form an institution of world-trang from the hitherto rather nationally known Regensburger Domspatzen, true cultural ambassadors of Europe and his musical tradition, which went on tour twice in the USA (1983 and 1987) and Japan (1988 and 1991).</seg>
<seg id="2986">With biscuits and candy alone, the unruly boys are not once a big singer and stand before every success, regardless of what area, but always discipline, passion and overcoming.</seg>
<seg id="2987">What kind of man did you experience with Georg Ratzinger during the talks to her book?</seg>
<seg id="2988">Michael Hesemann: through the work on the book and in addition, I met Georg Ratzinger very well and again and again experienced as wonderful, humorous, basic-minded, deeply believing and hearty people, of whom one can't imagine that he could even hurt a fly a little.</seg>
<seg id="2989">I get regular contact with him on a regular basis, like many ex-cats today, 23 years after his retirement, visit him, read him - he is almost blind - and treat him like a member of her family.</seg>
<seg id="2990">Those who have not forgiven him until today, that he was once strictly speaking to them, are thus unequivocally in the minority.</seg>
<seg id="2991">Most of the Domspatzen are thankful to him today that he has enriched their lives and told them the world of music.</seg>
<seg id="2992">And that he is always a good, fatherly teacher - a strict father, certainly, that may be - but also a lovely respect person, to which they still look up today and which they almost worship.</seg>
<seg id="2993">And please, once again, clearly: all that is accused of him are educational methods that were on the agenda at that time.</seg>
<seg id="2994">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "we can be happy that we have long overcame this time." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2995">But it is most unjust to make a man just because he is prominent and has a more prominent brother to make a medial scapegoat.</seg>
<seg id="2996">There is the evil intent behind it, only too obvious.</seg>
<seg id="2997">Because the report, which was just published, relieved him.</seg>
<seg id="2998">Now the anarchist would command a 93-year-old man who acquired great merits and without the outside of Bavaria and perhaps no one would know the Regensburger Domspatzen.</seg>
