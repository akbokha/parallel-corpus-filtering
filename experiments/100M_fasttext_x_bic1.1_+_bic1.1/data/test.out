28 @-@ year @-@ old chef found dead in San Francisco Mall
a 28 @-@ year @-@ old chef , who recently moved to San Francisco , was found dead in the stair@@ way of a local shopping centre .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the victim &apos;s brother said he can &apos;t imagine anyone who would harm him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Fin@@ ally , he went up with him again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the body found on Wednesday morning in West@@ field Mall was identified as the 28 @-@ year @-@ old Frank Gali@@ cia from San Francisco , divided the medical department in San Francisco .
the San Francisco Police Department said that death was clas@@ sed as murder and the investigations are running .
the brother of the victim , Louis Gali@@ cia , told the ABS transmitter K@@ GO in San Francisco that Frank , who previously worked as a cook in Boston , had his dream job as a cook in the S@@ ons &amp; Dau@@ ghters restaurant in San Francisco six months ago .
a spokes@@ man for the S@@ ons &amp; Dau@@ ghters said that they were &quot; shocked and destroyed on the ground . &quot;
&quot; we are a small team working like a close family and we will miss it pain@@ fully , &quot; said the speaker .
our thoughts and con@@ dol@@ ences are in this difficult period at Fran@@ ks &apos;s family and friends .
Louis Gali@@ cia admitted that Frank initially lived in host@@ els , but that &quot; things went up for him at last . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he found an apartment , he had a girlfriend , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; told Louis Gar@@ cia K@@ GO . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Louis Gali@@ cia said he could not imagine anyone who would harm his younger brother .
he was a friendly person with a big heart .
connecting his way with his family was to always cook us something , prepare ourselves for dinner , &quot; said Louis Gali@@ cia .
he never wanted to participate in any sort of dispute .
he was the brother who sw@@ am with the stream .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in everything that goes wrong in the world , he was this un@@ polished diamond that brigh@@ tened every day , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
anyone who has information on the case will be asked to call the information phone of the SF@@ PD under the number 4@@ 15 @-@ 5@@ 75 @-@ 44@@ 44 .
J@@ enni@@ fer Ani@@ ston : I &apos;m always put into drawers
J@@ enni@@ fer Ani@@ ston does not always have to be perfect or successful .
this has made Hollywood star un@@ equi@@ voc@@ ally clear in an interview .
&quot; I always get stuck in drawers or get stuck from outside labels that have little to do with me and the reality . &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t have the desire to always be perfect and successful . &quot;
&quot; to be honest , these things are rather slu@@ gg@@ ish . &quot;
J@@ enni@@ fer Ani@@ ston ( 47 ) can only laugh at the fact that she is considered &quot; Miss Perfect &quot; as explained in the &quot; Cos@@ mop@@ olitan . &quot;
most of all , the act@@ ress sp@@ ends her time at home , a tel@@ ev@@ ised TV with a great de@@ bris and Mexican food , that is in the magazine .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we don &apos;t have to be married or have children to be perfect , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the Hollywood star . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in her new movie &quot; Mother &apos;s Day - Love is not a child &apos;s play &quot; Ani@@ ston is seen as a single mother of two sons .
the film runs on the 25th of August .
Gol@@ fer Lan@@ ger wins the Sports Py@@ ramid
his experiences on the horse are man@@ a@@ geable .
at the end of a golf tournament in South Africa , Bernhard Lan@@ ger was looking for some di@@ version with some colleagues on the beach .
for the 58 @-@ year @-@ old , it was a premiere .
CH@@ IO : &quot; golden sports pyramid &quot; for Bernhard Lan@@ ger
after a few minutes the horses remembered their work , they drove home to the fe@@ ed@@ backs after a quick gal@@ lo@@ p .
a kilometer at this pace , I was afraid .
&quot; it was not a good experience , &quot; Lan@@ ger says .
and thus the equ@@ est@@ rian @-@ career ended already again .
on Saturday Germany was the best gol@@ fer of all time - 101 tournament victories - again close to horses .
he let himself be guided by his family on the system of the AL@@ RV , he did not even bo@@ ar for photo purposes on a horse .
long was the first time in Aachen and therefore also at the CH@@ IO .
the reason was quite convincing .
German sports aid handed the man from An@@ hausen under a small gala to the Golden sports pyramid .
the sy@@ mp@@ a@@ thetic ath@@ lete does not lack awards .
Federal Cross of Mer@@ it , Silver lau@@ rel leaf , Champions @-@ Tour @-@ Player of the Year ...
even the British Queen has already ad@@ ored him .
long is the 18th prize winner of the sports pyramid .
in Aachen he met the first prize winner Hans Günter Win@@ kler on Saturday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this award means a lot to me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Lan@@ ger says , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because it is not only awarded for sporting achievements , but also for social commitment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Lan@@ ger has been promoting the offspring for decades .
and so he continued the prize money of 25,000 euros equally .
with 15 other outstanding athletes , the two @-@ time US master winner was added to the Hall of F@@ ame of German Sports on Saturday .
the winners include the athletes of Hart@@ wig Gau@@ der and Harald Schmit@@ t , the Tur@@ ner Eber@@ hard Gi@@ enger , the F@@ MANN Corn@@ elia Han@@ isch , Alexander P@@ usch and Ar@@ nd Schmit@@ t , the Ru@@ derer Peter @-@ Michael Kol@@ be , the Ju@@ do@@ ka Frank Wi@@ en@@ e@@ ke , the ski@@ er Al@@ win Scho@@ ck@@ em@@ öh@@ le and pos@@ th@@ um the hand@@ ball of Er@@ hard Wunder@@ lich .
many of these sports@@ men came to Aachen on Saturday .
after the official part , the illustri@@ ous company wander@@ ed to the Spring@@ sta@@ dion where the Lav@@ azza prize went .
Bernhard Lan@@ ger kept a distance to the big animals .
Clinton and Tr@@ um@@ ps economic policy in comparison : it &apos;s all about the money
invest in infrastructure and prevent the T@@ TP trade agreement - both Clinton and Tr@@ ump .
however , the two U.S. presidential ri@@ vals are not one of the tax and energy policies as well as in a fundamental issue .
the differences in economic policy between Donald Tr@@ ump and H@@ illary Clinton are fundamental , rather philosophical .
that , on the role of the state .
Tr@@ ump wants to keep those in doubt rather small and warns of how the state of the economy can harm - with taxes and regulations .
Clinton wanted to tax the economy to death and regulate it to death , he says .
he himself , on the other hand , would be quite different , claims tr@@ ump .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he will dras@@ tically rec@@ la@@ im regulations , and he is strong for a far @-@ reaching tax reform with lower tax rates - for private people and for companies . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Clinton , on the other hand , says : the state has to fulfill certain tasks , it has dis@@ advant@@ aged opportunities to open up and needs money .
therefore taxes for the rich would be increased , they say .
interest@@ ingly , both are very close to infrastructure .
in the future , Tr@@ ump and Clinton are almost wor@@ rying .
the democratic candidate announces the largest investment in new jobs since the Second World War .
state investment programs in the infrastructure are traditional democratic policies and are strictly opposed by the State @-@ critical Te@@ ap@@ y wing of the Republi@@ cans .
so on Tr@@ ump you could face party discussions .
the differences in energy and climate policies are more pronounced .
Tr@@ ump wants to build coal @-@ fired power plants and re@@ boot coal mining in the USA .
oil extraction should also be possible in so far protected areas , the Paris climate protection agreement will be canc@@ eled .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Clinton , on the other hand , wants to expand the renew@@ ables &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; renewable energy &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with its investment programme and demands : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a country will become the super power of clean energies and create millions of jobs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it will be either China , Germany or America - I want us to be . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but not only in infrastructure - even in international trade agreements , the two competitors are not too far apart from each other .
T@@ PP , the tran@@ spa@@ zi@@ pan trade agreement , do not want to sign both .
at the same time , both , however , do not want to isol@@ ate the US from international trade , but simply protect American jobs better .
they should be paid better then , for example , Clinton calls .
the current minimum wage of $ 7.@@ 25 is a star@@ vation wage .
he wants to raise it to 15 dollars per hour .
what Tr@@ ump wants to do in this question is not quite clear : once he says : the minimum wage must arise , then he says he cannot be changed .
but the great discussion of the coming months is likely to be more likely to develop the tax policy of the two camps .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the one hand stands Tr@@ ump , who wants to relieve the economy and citizens to boost growth . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his critics are telling him that the budget deficit would be even greater .
on the other hand , Clinton , who wants to demand at least from the rich , is to pay more taxes , and their critics say : more taxes are not the solution either .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; escape : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; every woman who has escaped has experiences with sexual violence &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
sexual violence is almost a part of everyday life for women who are fle@@ eing alone .
when they arrive in Germany they are often traumati@@ zed .
a house offers refuge .
four women sit in a large kitchen .
each one has a baby , which is at most one year old .
one has placed her little son in her arm .
he looks curi@@ ously into the room with big eyes .
his mother star@@ es on the tab@@ let@@ op .
until she notices that she is observed .
she smil@@ ed briefly and kis@@ ses the little ones .
the scene is normal .
until you speak with Kat@@ rin B@@ ahr .
she is a member of Con@@ dro@@ bs , a branch manager for social assistance in Bavaria , and deals among other things with the issue of women on the run .
the four women in the kitchen are poultry .
they live in the north of Munich in one of the few decentr@@ alised accommodations for single @-@ fle@@ dged women and their children in Bavaria .
in January Con@@ dro@@ bs appointed the establishment together with Pro Famili@@ a and the Munich Women &apos;s Aid .
recently it was officially opened .
60 people live there - about 40 women and 20 children .
there are no men - neither as visitors .
the exception is a guard in front of the door .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is not exagger@@ ation to say : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; every woman who arrives here has experience with sexual violence on her escape , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says B@@ ahr . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; men flee for wars because they are persecuted politically because they thre@@ aten torture or death , or because their families send them to Europe as the hope @-@ makers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in women there are other reasons for the escape : &quot; many steal away secretly , because they see no other way out . &quot;
in their homeland , they have experience with sexual violence , forced marri@@ ages , fre@@ edoms , slavery or forced pro@@ stitution .
it drives them away .
on the run , that goes on .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that tu@@ gs for example call for a bottle of water a sexual act is not a r@@ arity , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says B@@ ahr . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and the women are alone , they are not protected by their families .
who believe that when they arrive in Germany , the end tells B@@ ahr .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; here too , single women in refugee camps are often considered inferior and ab@@ used in the worst case . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this means that approximately 90 percent of women living in the housing in the north of Munich are traumati@@ zed , they appreciate .
&quot; some of the children are certainly not made up voluntarily . &quot;
many women are accustomed to saying nothing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or they don &apos;t dare to speak openly about the experience , because the shame is too big . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
since they often don &apos;t know how to help , it needs more accommodations just for them , asks B@@ ahr .
in Bavaria , the seven district governments are responsible for the housing of refugees .
on the question of whether they knew about a similar project as in Munich in their sphere of competence , some respond with no .
in the Upper Pal@@ at@@ inate and Upper Fran@@ con@@ ia there is such a thing in accommodations of governments .
even in Sw@@ ab@@ ia alone , fle@@ eing women are not accommod@@ ated separately , says Karl @-@ Heinz Meyer , spokes@@ man for the government .
in Upper Bavaria , Lower and Middle Fran@@ con@@ ia there are floors or own houses only for single women and their children .
the exception is Nieder@@ bay@@ ern , there are two central accommodations exclusively for women .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Committee &quot; Rights of Women and Gender E@@ quality &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the European Parliament also calls for women to be accommod@@ ated separately from men . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a study published for the committee it says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is very important that men and women are accommod@@ ated separately . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; lack of privacy or will men and women be accommod@@ ated together , it can - perpet@@ r@@ ingly - come against women . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
especially the wash@@ rooms should be separated and easily accessible to women , is in the study .
how much the women feel this vulner@@ ability can be read on the urge to go to the house in Munich .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since we have talked about it , we have a long waiting list , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says B@@ ahr . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
one could easily put up a second house .
assistant physicians argue : demands for new employment promotion measures
assistant physicians have called upon their union to appro@@ ve new employment campaigns in their dispute with regard to a new contract .
the Junior Doc@@ tors Committee ( J@@ DC ) of the British Medical Association ( B@@ MA ) called for its entire Council to appro@@ ve more action from the beginning of September .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the J@@ DC said that ministers ab@@ used ministers to deal with the concerns about the treaty . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
resident doctors and medical students voted in July about the rejection of a contract agreed with the B@@ MA .
it was rejected by 58 % of its members voted in the elections .
in a letter to the members published on Twitter on Thursday evening , the chairman of the J@@ DC Ellen Mc@@ Court said that the government &quot; persist@@ ently cal@@ m@@ ly &quot; had problems , which led to the refusal of the treaty .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; In view of this , the J@@ DC Board has voted to completely reject the proposed new treaty and request official re @-@ negotiations for all your concerns . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
as an answer to the silence of the government , the J@@ DC Board today made a formal request for a special meeting of the B@@ MA Council to appro@@ ve a running program of escal@@ ating work campaigns that begins at the beginning of September .
the disputes have led to the fact that assistance doctors struck six times this year , the first total failures in the history of the N@@ HS .
the head of the B@@ MA Assist@@ enz@@ forschung Dr. Johann Mal@@ aw@@ ana came back after the election for the rejection of the agreed contractual conditions , which had been recommended by the B@@ MA .
he shared B@@ MA members during the meetings , which took place before the vote by 5@@ 4.000 resident doctors and medical students , stating that the contract should be advantageous and accepted .
after the vote , the Minister of Health Jerem@@ y Hun@@ t said that the Treaty for Doc@@ tors in England would be introduced forci@@ bly .
Russia and Turkey : an &quot; out@@ sider &apos;s alliance &quot; ?
it was a gesture that ended a crisis .
the leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to surrender their hands and to proclaim an official end to the eight @-@ month @-@ long war of words and economic sanctions .
but when Vladimir Putin is receiving his Turkish counter@@ player in the gil@@ ded room of the St. Petersburg Palace , I cannot deny the impression that Ankara wants this reconciliation the most .
there was the hand@@ shake , yes .
but Putin &apos;s smile seemed ta@@ sted and he did not radi@@ ate heat even for his restra@@ ined circumstances .
Rec@@ ep Tay@@ y@@ ip Erdo@@ gan , on the other hand , spoke of his &quot; dear friend &quot; Putin - according to a report complete five times .
I couldn &apos;t count it any more .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he also promised that relations with Russia would not only return to their old level before the crisis , but will even improve . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the next day , a newspaper described that Erdo@@ gan had beha@@ ved as if something terrible had never happened .
to me his enthusiasm seemed to be rather the opposite .
but one of Putin &apos;s radi@@ ating , sustainable cool@@ ness showed that Russia &apos;s head of state had nothing to forget .
on the contrary , the cause of the crisis was the first thing he mentioned in his introduc@@ tory words : the shot of a Russian fighter plane on the Syrian border through Turkey .
Moscow &apos;s reaction to the time was fur@@ ious .
Putin den@@ ounced and accused Ankara to have fallen into the back of Russia .
the off@@ ence was even greater , as it was done by a supposed friend .
building up the confidence is difficult , if not impossible .
public opinion in Russia has changed since November .
for months , the state @-@ controlled media launched a violent , un@@ restricted attack on Ankara .
at one time it seemed as if the Turks were to blame for everything .
at the most serious were the alleg@@ ations of senior officials that Erdo@@ gan &apos;s own family had benefited from illegal oil trading in areas of Syria controlled by the so @-@ called Islamic State .
he v@@ ehem@@ ently denied this .
but in St.@@ Petersburg the official message was that it was time to look forward .
finally , this meeting was held only because Putin received the excuse he wanted to hear from President Erdo@@ gan .
Russia could make a kind of victory .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for Ankara , the advantages of a ce@@ ase@@ fire are clear on the hand . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Erdo@@ gan now needs all the friends he can get after he was reli@@ eved of his ministry in a failed coup d &apos;@@ et@@ at last month .
repeated terrorist attacks on Turkey have also shocked him .
but there are economic motives also .
Russian sanctions have hit Turkey hard - in particular the ban on charter flights that usually bring several million Russian tourists to the Turkish coast every year .
the number has declined by almost 90 % .
in Russia , tour operators and charter companies will be reli@@ eved when flights are resum@@ ed .
they are counting on a late @-@ season rush to the Mediterranean .
this week the state television forecast cheaper fruit and vegetables as soon as Turkish agr@@ arian imports are allowed again .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a report in Ve@@ demo@@ s formulated it as follows : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tourists there , tomatoes here long . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the visit had an additional political value for Moscow .
Ankara is fur@@ ious to the West , as it regards its reaction to the attempted sei@@ z@@ ure of power as a weak answer .
in addition , the continued gru@@ dge against the sn@@ ail emp@@ o of EU accession negotiations and Putin - which is pi@@ er@@ ced to take advantage of the cool atmosphere and reduce the relationship between Turkey and the West .
the Russian head of state won in Ankara with certainty a bonus that he demanded support for the elected state organs after the attempted coup d &quot; é@@ tat .
this is well @-@ understood for Moscow , which even has a deep @-@ seated fear of regime change .
the summit in this gl@@ it@@ tering palace by the sea made it possible for Russia and Turkey to present an &quot; alliance of out@@ si@@ ders , &quot; as an analy@@ st once described : two countries that feel abandoned and badly treated by the West and are now alli@@ ed .
nevertheless , despite the public reconciliation , there are still great differences between the two .
the biggest difference is Syria , where Moscow has recently played the role as a peac@@ em@@ akers , but where Russia and Turkey support opposing sides .
it could be significant that after almost three hours of initial talks , both pres@@ idents shou@@ ted at the press conference that they had not even stri@@ pped the issue .
the President of Turkey deliberately avoided a question of their differences , while Putin decided to emphasize them .
there is no clear consensus on where a common denom@@ in@@ ator can be found in Syria .
but after months of open hos@@ tilities - and in view of the potential for a perfect disaster when NATO member Turkey shot the Russian fighter jet - it is certainly better that the two leaders at least speak again .
Royal Bank of Scotland not available for customers outside Scotland
according to the Bank CEO , the R@@ BS brand should only be reduced to a back office role .
the Royal Bank of Scotland will no longer be available to customers outside of Scotland .
Ross Mc@@ E@@ wan shared the BBC Scotland that the R@@ BS brand was associated with the Bank &apos;s global ambi@@ tions .
the Bank has dist@@ anced itself since then , when it had to be collap@@ sed and saved eight years ago .
in this period , brand strate@@ gi@@ sts &quot; R@@ BS &quot; have used to protect other end @-@ consumer trademarks .
she supported the international sport with millions of pounds of sponsor@@ ship , from the Six Nations Ru@@ g@@ by to Wim@@ ble@@ don winner Andy Mur@@ ray .
but now she has decided to put more national marks into focus .
the Royal Bank of Scotland will only be available to customers in Scotland but will not be initi@@ alized .
in England and Wales , all RS@@ B references , the decentr@@ alised head@@ quarter and stock exchange listing to Nat@@ West will change .
the Ul@@ ster Bank brand is already used for customers in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland .
there are other , smaller brands for retail , which are more important - C@@ out@@ ts , Adam &amp; Co , Dr@@ um@@ mond and Hol@@ t &apos;s Military Bank .
Mc@@ E@@ wan was inter@@ viewed during a sightseeing tour of customers and employees in In@@ ver@@ ness @-@ Shi@@ re .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he shared the BBC Scotland with : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the brand RS@@ B becomes our investor brand as well as the brand under which our employees will be employed , as we now become more of a bank of brands . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
when the Bank itself became a global brand , R@@ BS became a global brand .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I now say that we do not pursue global goals , but local goals . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
each of these brands will stand in their own communities for something completely different and our employees will work among these brands with the customers .
R@@ BS has already said that it will no longer continue its Six Nations sponsor@@ ship and that it will increase the percep@@ ti@@ bility of the various brands in its sport sponsor@@ ship .
&quot; it &apos;s time for us to become the bank of the brands , because how do we focus internally ( we asked ) to make this a better bank for customers ? &quot; said the CEO .
it would have been very cy@@ ni@@ cal three years ago , if we had said that we would be a great bank for our customers and have launched these brands .
but with our work , the focus on customer needs and not our own , I think you will see many changes .
we can launch these stamps again , so I think that the time has come .

I am very happy that it happened in New@@ market because I landed here 30 years ago .
it &apos;s not a big meeting , it &apos;s not Royal As@@ cot - it &apos;s a ban@@ al Friday evening with 20.000 people .
I am reli@@ eved and very modest .
D@@ ett@@ ori absor@@ bs the che@@ er when he pi@@ cks up victory on pre@@ dil@@ ection
two Jo@@ ckey players reached the milestone in the obstacle race - Jo@@ ckey Richard Johnson and retired 20 @-@ time winner Sir Anthony Mc@@ Co@@ y , who scored more than 4,@@ 300 victories in a rec@@ ord@@ able career .
L@@ ester Pig@@ got@@ t , the nine @-@ time Der@@ by@@ si@@ eger , had 4,@@ 4@@ 93 career prospects
Frank@@ ie is one of the best jo@@ ckey of Moder@@ nis@@ m and it &apos;s no surprise that he achieved this milestone , which only a few have reached before him .
he has style and is strong , but it &apos;s his tac@@ tical intell@@ ect that distinguishes him from the others in the weight control room .
he is a fantastic ambassador for races , his enthusiasm and charism@@ a has been enth@@ r@@ alled fans for years for this sport .
I said Frank@@ ie several weeks ago at Ep@@ som that he had already taken 6,000 wins if he wasn &apos;t just a weekend and big tournament jo@@ ckey !
Frank@@ ie has already suffered nearly 30 years of winners in the UK , which is great .
he has a living personality , which is good for a British race , but beyond that he is an incredible jo@@ ckey .
Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori celebrated the milestone with a typical Flying Dis@@ mount
from Flying Fin@@ ishes to Flying Dis@@ moun@@ ts , Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori has been the flagship of the British flat race for two decades .
it was nerve wre@@ cking .
a whole series of major tournaments , including his famous Gl@@ orious Si@@ eben in 1996 at As@@ cot , but he also survived a plane crash and was banned from drugs .
three years ago he had difficulties when he returned from his six month lock , but he showed an impressive characteristic strength to def@@ y his doub@@ ters and return to his best form .
and he is not in the end for a long time - D@@ ett@@ ori once said that he wants to continue with competitions up to at least 5@@ 0.@@ ten years of age .
Russian Putin fired Chief of Staff Serge@@ i Ivan@@ ov
Russian President Vladimir Putin has un@@ expect@@ edly dismissed the Chief of Staff Serge@@ i Ivan@@ ov .
IV@@ AN@@ O@@ V was part of Putin &apos;s closest confidence circle for many years .
the 63 @-@ year @-@ old was appointed as special representative for environmental and transport matters .
in a statement by the Krem@@ lin , it says that without stating reasons , Putin has ordered the discharge of Ivan@@ ov@@ s from his duties as Chairman of the Russian Pres@@ idential Administration . &quot;
Anton V@@ ain@@ o , who was Vice @-@ Repres@@ entative since 2012 , was appointed to his successor .
V@@ ain@@ o , 44 , is a former diplom@@ at .
born in the Est@@ onian capital of Tall@@ inn in 1972 , he graduated from the prestigious State Moscow Institute of International Relations ( M@@ GI@@ MO ) and worked at the Embassy in Tokyo .
on the Krem@@ lin &apos;s website ( in Russian ) , he later became the Chief of Staff and Chief of Staff of the Pro@@ visional Government .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said to Putin about his appointment : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thank you for your confidence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I think it is the most important task of the government to support your activities as head of state regarding bills of law and controls for the implementation of your instructions .
Putin told the Russian TV station on Friday that Ivan@@ ov had asked to leave his post and recommended V@@ ain@@ o as his successor .
do the smiling faces convince you ?
this step has made Moscow mysterious .
Serge@@ i Ivan@@ ov was a long time one of Vladimir Putin &apos;s closest confi@@ dant and works as he was for the Soviet intelligence service , the K@@ GB .
as Chief of Staff , he was one of the most powerful men in the country .
during a meeting with President Putin , which was broad@@ cast@@ ed on television , both men claimed that the Chief of Staff will res@@ ign at his own request .
but despite the ridi@@ cu@@ le for the cameras , few of them are convinced - especially now , just before the parliamentary elections .
so is the consequence of a kind of power struggle ?
nobody knows this at this time .
but the official asser@@ tion - that a man who once was tou@@ ted as a potential president , at one time wants to lead Russian environmental policy - met great scep@@ ticism .
in his remarks to Putin , who are quoted on the Krem@@ lin &apos;s website , Ivan@@ ov said it is true that I asked you in a conversation at the beginning of 2012 , to give me this very complicated job - you could almost say - entru@@ sting job for four years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as it turns out , I have been chairman of the Russian presidential administration for four years and eight months . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
IV@@ AN@@ O@@ V accepted the post in December 2011 .
prior to that , he was Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defence .
he is a member of the Russian Security Council and as Putin &apos;s former member of the K@@ GB State Security Service .
in the late 1990s , when Putin was chairman of the Federal Security Service ( FS@@ B ) , who replaced the K@@ GB , Ivan@@ ov was appointed his deputy .
when Putin came to power , he called Ivan@@ ov as one of five people , whom he most trusted .
once it was assumed that after Putin &apos;s second term of office Ivan@@ ov could become President of Russia , as a third term Putin would have viol@@ ated Putin &apos;s constitution .
but this post was taken by another , close friend of Putin , D@@ mit@@ ry Med@@ ve@@ dev .
Putin became Prime Minister before becoming president three and a half years later .
criminal Min@@ ds Star Thomas Gib@@ son fired after he hit producers
Gib@@ son took part in a physical examination at the set of the series in Los Angeles last month .
ABC studios and C@@ BS Television Studios that produce the series announced their termination in a joint statement .
Gib@@ son , who played the Special Agent Aaron Hot@@ chner , publicly ap@@ ologi@@ zed on Thursday before the announcement of his termination .
on the set there were artistic differences and differences of opinion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I regret the incident , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in a message . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
details on how the character Gi@@ bs@@ ons from the series , which follows a team of FB@@ I agents , is expected to be published at a later date according to ABC studios and C@@ BS Television Studios .
the 54 @-@ year @-@ old , who previously played in the Sit@@ com D@@ har@@ ma &amp; Gre@@ g , was with him since the first season of the series in 2005 .
&quot; I love criminal stuff and I have put my whole heart blood in the last twelve years , &quot; said Gib@@ son in a message published on Friday .
I had hoped to be there until the end , but that will no longer be possible .
I would like to thank the authors , producers , actors , our wonderful crew and especially the best fans you can only wish for a series .
the planned broadcast of the twel@@ fth season is scheduled for September 28 .
puzzles for fish that landed in Ban@@ ff &apos;s garden
an inhabit@@ ant of Ban@@ ff demanded help in the identification of the fish that appeared in his garden in Ban@@ ff .
Kevin B@@ ain thinks it could deal with the 75 fish@@ ings around Sand@@ a@@ ale , which were blown out by a fountain .
Mr. B@@ ain , who lives about 500 meters from the sea , published on Per@@ is@@ cope a video of the spectacle in the hope that someone could throw some light on the appearance of the two inch long fish .
Que@@ ens@@ land Crossing : bridge now connected to Fi@@ fe
the € 1.@@ 35 billion project will be completed by May 2017
engineers have connected the northern deck of Que@@ ens@@ land cross@@ ings with the Vi@@ a@@ duct - which means that the bridge is now connected to Fi@@ fe .
it is the first of four closures of the &quot; deck@@ b@@ lower &quot; approaching the completion of each of the three towers of the bridge .
the bridge section of Fi@@ fe is now 600 metres long and weighs 30,000 tons .
it has 10,000 tons of steel and 20,000 tons of concrete and 46 slan@@ t ropes .
the project is expected to be completed by May 2017 .
Minister of Economics Kei@@ th Brown provided a visit to the construction site today and was one of the first to move from the country to the bridge .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; This is a historical and symbolic moment in the construction of Que@@ ens@@ land cross@@ ings . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we are all witnesses of an engineering art of a truly epic extent in this project involving more than 30,000 tons of concrete and steel used alone for this part of the bridge .
despite the massive size and weight of the bridge , completion of the closure between the vi@@ a@@ duct and the bridge deck is a delicate activity requiring extremely precise tolerances for fit .
in total , almost 79 % of the total deck is at its place and the last section of the deck is given a concrete shot for the deck today in Ros@@ y@@ th , which means that the entire deck is ready to be lifted to its place on the bridge .
Michael Martin , Project Manager of For@@ th Crossing Bridge Construc@@ tor said : &quot; the first closure is a major milestone in every bridge project .
this fantastic project represents the closure of forward @-@ looking high and civil engineering .
after the installation of the last block of the road and its connection with the northern tower in the building , we had to close the existing gap on the north or side of the country .
this was achieved by pulling the northern feeder bridge 700 millimeters south .
this was a massive and at the same time very delicate activity .
massive , since the Vi@@ a@@ duct is 2@@ 22 meters long , weighs about 6,000 tons and had to be pulled upwards at an incline of approx . 3 % .
as the tolerances to which the team works were tiny , they were only a few milli@@ metres on each side .
fortunately everything went very well .
Sal@@ vation in Mo@@ el@@ f@@ re Bay : three men have &quot; luck still alive &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; three men have &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; luck still alive &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after they were thrown off their fishing boat in front of Angl@@ es@@ ey . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Mo@@ el@@ f@@ re R@@ N@@ LI rescue station sounded the alarm on Friday at 13 : 20 BS@@ T after a crew watched the event in Mo@@ el@@ f@@ re Bay .
the three men had difficulty swimming in safety , while their boat moved on their own strength .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we saw how the boat turned around and made the worst possible for us , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the head of the rescue station of Mo@@ el@@ f@@ re Vin@@ ce Jones . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fortunately , the strong winds ble@@ w the boat out of its reach until we left to water , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he added . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
two of the men were saved by a local fishing boat , while the third man was exhausted at the age of 60 and was found hanging on a bu@@ o@@ y without a life@@ jacket .
they all came aboard the shore rescue boat and were taken back to the rescue station
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mr Jones said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the three men who were thrown into the water have happiness un@@ har@@ med and still alive . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the boat engine had an emergency stop , but the boat was released from the person who ste@@ ered the boat .
someone today w@@ akes over these men .

who builds cheap apartments from Braunschweig ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the SPD and the Gre@@ ens mean : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in future investors should be put more strongly into duty . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
how do you react to the bad news that Braunschweig is losing nearly 1,@@ 300 affordable apartments in the next few years ?
the SPD is propos@@ ing a &quot; Action Plan Living &quot; to the next council session .
but dispute is programmed .
first and foremost , the question is : who should build the cheap apartments ?
a regulation is missing so far .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said S &amp; D Group president Christoph Brat@@ mann : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we agree with the Gre@@ ens : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; those who want to build on urban areas must in future exhibit 20 percent of all apartments as social housing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , the cheap apartments can also be built in the continu@@ ance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , the major force in the town hall is , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; How to deal with investors who want to build on private surfaces ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want investors to build at least 10 per cent on such areas , but as much as 20 per cent of homes as social housing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a new urban housing development programme that will cost millions and must still be financed should provide incentives . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the problem , said Brat@@ mann : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is currently no agreement between the fac@@ tions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the CD@@ U wants to make as few prescri@@ ptions as possible .
the left wants harder jobs for investors .
despite this , Brat@@ mann said , there is a sharpen@@ ing of the situation on the housing market .
if the action concept is implemented , it will provide additional tasks in the construction management .
more staff is needed .
it is unclear whether we will receive the experts .
but the programme is not yet complete : because the approximately 12@@ 60 new apartments , which should be built anyway .
but how do you compare the loss of other around 1300 advantageous apartments , whose promotion will exp@@ ire in the coming years ?
by 2020 alone , there will be 500 apartments .
to prevent this , the planning oli@@ st Nicole Palm should now be bought out @-@ running ties from the city .
in addition , it would have to be thought of taking flats back into the price bond .
this is possible in the western city .
at one stroke , the problem could be solved .
because in the western city , dead@@ lines run out at the end of the year .
about 1800 apartments could be found there back in the price binding for cheap apartments .
only : this does not want the owners , the housing associations .
because the number of social housing in the western city is increased dramatically , one removes itself from the goal of so @-@ called mixing .
there should be no concentration of socially dis@@ advant@@ aged in just a few districts .
the Gre@@ ens expect that there will be movement in the discussion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Group President Holger Her@@ lit@@ sch@@ ke : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for a broad majority , the CD@@ U must start the boat . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I concentrated on more building sites for single family homes .
but what does not mean that a compromise can not yet be found .
Pok@@ é@@ mon Go , a hunt for health and happiness that pays off
it is fascinating to see how the world changes .
the fact that teenagers and children do not go outside for games but prefer to spend their free time on screens , has been compl@@ ained in the last decade of many .
Pok@@ emon &apos;s Go is about getting people from the sofa and getting more active .
the time on the screen was initially limited to the TV , then on video games and last on smartphones .
so it &apos;s great to see that technology and outdoor activities don &apos;t exclude each other .
of course I refer to the Pok@@ é@@ mon Go @-@ W@@ ahn , an app based on the characters that were initially created for video games in the 1990s ( later developed into a cartoon series , playing cards and other spin @-@ offs ) .
like many pop culture phenomena , the interest in the publication of the game in the USA , Australia and New Zealand fell slightly in the beginning of July .
market launch in other countries was postpon@@ ed by massive demand that over@@ laid the servers .
within a few days , Pok@@ é@@ mon Go had more users than Tin@@ der and nearly as many as Twitter .
how does it work ?
in short , players go outside with their smartphones and look for Pok@@ é@@ m@@ ons that are tra@@ cked with a GPS and as soon as they have been found , &quot; photographs &quot; ( using a screen@@ shot on the mobile phone ) or &quot; captured . &quot;
a generation who played the game when she was younger , joined the del@@ usion and j@@ umped for the sofa .
in the US , the game led to a considerable increase in steps that the average person puts back every day .
Car@@ di@@ ogram , an app for Apple Watch , which follow@@ es 35@@ ,000 users , recently announced that within two days after the launch of the game , the number of followed people who train every day 30 minutes , rose from 45 percent to 53 percent .
the company does not know who plays Pok@@ é@@ mon Go - it only sees the raw data for increasing performance .
many public health awareness campaigns that people want to &quot; take 30 minutes &quot; to &quot; come off the sofa &quot; and &quot; be active every day , &quot; have met de@@ af ears because many public messages are boring to health and come from people who look da@@ zz@@ ling .
nevertheless , the importance of sport cannot be over@@ rated .
anyone who regularly drives sports reduces his chances of developing cancer or depression .
physical activity helps in weight control , high blood pressure , diabetes and a long list of benefits that are too long to lead them here .
but the wonderful thing about Pok@@ é@@ mon Go is that it brings people to do something outdoors that makes them fun .
thus three pillars of health are covered - exercise , fresh air and sunshine as well as fun .
some people even close new friend@@ ships on the hunt .
as always , there are also mos@@ quit@@ oes that have to complain about something .
and yes , someone could run against a door .
what should it be ?
it has been a breakthrough .
even if Smartphone @-@ Apps like Fit@@ bit could already track our activity earlier , they didn &apos;t give us a reason to do sports as it does this game .
the new will lose its attraction and the use will fade with time .
however , due to Pok@@ em@@ ons &apos;s success , there will be more games that will unite the apps and virtual reality with the activity in the real world , helping many people in the hunt to be more active , f@@ itter and healthier .

Sim@@ one Bil@@ es Cre@@ ates Gold in the Dam@@ age
forget the pressure .
forget the hyp@@ e .
Sim@@ one Bil@@ es is immune to all this .
dynamic on the jumping horse .
effort@@ lessly on the bar .
breathtaking on the ground .
brilliant all the way .
and now finally Olympic Champion .
the 19 @-@ year @-@ old American gymn@@ ast inv@@ oked the competition title on Thursday and enlarged the gap between himself and the rest of the world in front of all eyes under the spotlight of the Olympic Games .
their overall result of 6@@ 2,@@ 19@@ 8 was clearly ahead of the Silver Med@@ al winner and &quot; Final Five &quot; crew cam@@ er@@ adi@@ n A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man and the Russian bronze medal winner Ali@@ ya Must@@ af@@ ina .
the American women Sim@@ one Bil@@ es tur@@ nt on the bar @-@ bar during the single multi @-@ competition of women in the gymn@@ as@@ tics stadium in Rio de Jan@@ eiro 2016 , Brazil , Thursday .
Bil@@ es is the fourth h@@ eter@@ os@@ exual American woman who wins a multi @-@ fight title and overall the fifth , while she consoli@@ dates her call to be the best of her generation or even at all .
she burst into tears when her final result was shown and her long journey in that moment came to an end .
this success puts them in the same league as unique athletes like Michael P@@ helps , who have brought their sports to new heights :
Bil@@ es has dominated her sport for the last three years , including 15 World Champion med@@ als - including 10 gold med@@ als - with so amazing exercises that include a mixture of ambition and precision that the 1984 Mary Lo@@ u Res@@ on from her said she is &quot; the best gymn@@ ast I &apos;ve ever seen . &quot;
she expected her last test in Brazil , a competition not so much between Bil@@ es and the rest of the athletes , but rather between her and a load of over@@ sized expectations .
not returning with a handful of gold back to the family in Spring , Texas , would be regarded as dis@@ appointment .
American women Sim@@ one Bil@@ es , left , and A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man hu@@ g themselves after winning gold and silver in the single multi @-@ competition women &apos;s competition in the Summer Olympics 2016 in Rio de Jan@@ eiro , Brazil , Thursday
Bil@@ es took the first medal on Tuesday , while she served as ex@@ clamation mark at the f@@ arewell ceremony of the co @-@ ordin@@ ator Martha Kar@@ oly@@ i .
although Bil@@ es insist@@ ed on having never planned the future during their long journey to the top , this is not really true .
part of their floor exercises - which contain their typical Tum@@ bling Pass - is matched to Latin American music that would fit on the street outside the Olympic arena in Rio .
this is not a coinci@@ dence .
this girl , adopted by her grand@@ parents as a small child and was discovered by trainer A@@ im@@ ee Bo@@ or@@ mans mother during a school discharge into the gymn@@ asi@@ um , in which Bo@@ or@@ man trained , became a force .
since the summer of 2013 , she has no longer lost a multi @-@ competition competition , a winning series that will stop as long as Bil@@ es wishes .
even if Must@@ afa was led slightly by two turns , the image ble@@ ed .
floating @-@ beams and ground floor - in which Bil@@ es holds the world title - lou@@ dly .
she resum@@ ed with 15,@@ 4@@ 33 on the bar @-@ beam again - and on the ground with a 15,@@ 9@@ 33 on the floor .
Ra@@ is@@ man embra@@ ced her sof@@ tly when she expected her grand@@ son - a pure form@@ ality - and tears stre@@ amed on Bil@@ es shiny red , white and blue eyel@@ iner , as the vision she once described in her collection book became reality .
the performance Ra@@ is@@ mans was a revenge for the last time four years ago when she fought for the third place , but the bronze medal went to Must@@ afa in a Ti@@ eb@@ ra@@ ke .
this time , the 22 @-@ year @-@ old team capit@@ ain , which is called the &quot; Grand@@ ma &quot; by Americans , had a head start .
after her practice , she threw out K@@ us@@ sh@@ lands to the public , overwhel@@ med by a com@@ eback , which sometimes seemed doub@@ t@@ ful .
as for Bil@@ es , the rapidly expanding T@@ we@@ et of the 19 @-@ year @-@ old has a whole new meaning from the beginning of this week :
police : 3 victims shot in a serial killer when listening to music in the car
according to police reports published on Thursday , two women and a 12 @-@ year @-@ old girl died , who died in one of the dead@@ liest attacks since a decade in the first serial killer of Phoenix while they stopped in the car and listened to music .
Angela Rochelle Liner , Stefanie R. El@@ lis and El@@ lis &apos;s daughter Mal@@ e@@ ah were shot on June 12 , while the car was par@@ ked in a dri@@ ve@@ way , the authorities said .
the perpet@@ r@@ ator fired eight shots from a hand @-@ made fire@@ arm while he stood on the passenger side of the car and subsequently fled with another vehicle to read in the report .
the police announced that the triple murder would not have been the result of a rob@@ ber@@ y of rob@@ ber@@ y since the aggres@@ sor did not take the hand@@ bags or the $ 2,@@ 900 owned by one of the adult victims .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the police spokes@@ man by Phoenix S@@ g@@ t. Jonathan Howard said that the shooting prompted the investig@@ ators to take a closer look at whether it is connected with four previous attacks . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a total of seven people were killed in h@@ is@@ panic residen@@ ces within four months and two others were injured .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it happens in a residential area in front of a house , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; told Howard the K@@ H@@ PO , a subsidiary of C@@ BS , at the beginning of the month . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is assumed that the suspect has used several vehicles , including a brown N@@ iss@@ ant from the late 1990s , a black BMW from the late 1990s and a white Cadi@@ l@@ lac or Lincoln .
the investig@@ ators refused to disclose the evidence that they have led to the conclusion that the attacks were linked and committed by the same mur@@ derer .
El@@ lis , 33 , was hosp@@ ital@@ ised for her injuries and died later .
liner , 31 , and El@@ lis &apos;s daughter Mal@@ e@@ ah died still on the spot .
a witness told the police that it was not unusual for them to sit in a par@@ ked car and listen to music .
the authorities also published a police report on the shooting , which was aimed at an empty pickup truck half an hour before the triple murder and assumed that it was the work of the serial killer .
investig@@ ators found cartridges and secured a bul@@ let from the seat as well as ball fragments from the engine compartment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mother of a 6 year old with micro@@ cephal@@ y : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it gets better &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what is wrong at all -- of course , one has left on it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
her husband Vincent and her have been told that Ed@@ mund will never be able to recognize her and that he may not even survive .
some doctors even went so far that they proposed to institution@@ alize him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my first answer was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I did not know that people still do , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; declared Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ed@@ mund is able to walk with the help of a help .
Ed@@ mund was unable to sit or craw@@ l up until his third year of life and he still cannot speak .
but he is slowly making progress .
it can run with support and cycle .
he also loves to play and sing with his two brothers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Elizabeth shows the sign language Ed@@ mund has conceived for &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Please sing me something . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; we bring him sign language , &quot; Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to C@@ BS News .
but it &apos;s not a typical sign language -- she says . Ed@@ mund has invented some characters on her own .
micro@@ cephal@@ ia has a variety of causes : genetic like Ed@@ mund and infections with viruses such as meas@@ les or the Zi@@ k@@ avi@@ rus during pregnancy .
the symptoms and progn@@ oses may vary greatly .
it is still too early to say how it will affect the life of the virus infected with the Zi@@ k@@ avi@@ rus .
Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to rec@@ alls the emotional price of an uncertain future .
I constantly asked what will happen ?
what will happen ?
and she still doesn &apos;t know .
I haven &apos;t asked for the forecast for a long time , because I don &apos;t expect someone to really tell me .
but Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to has a hop@@ eful advice for mothers of infants with birth defects caused by the Zi@@ k@@ avi@@ rus .
it gets better .
they know that it will be better for you .
you will love your child and your child will love you .
heavy rainf@@ alls , floo@@ ding gives cause for b@@ ail@@ outs in Lou@@ isi@@ ana , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi
heavy rainf@@ alls and widespread floo@@ ding in Lou@@ isi@@ ana forced the governor to proclaim the emergency on Friday .
numerous rivers in the southeast of Lou@@ isi@@ ana and the south of the Miss@@ issi@@ ppi floo@@ ded their shores and threatened with widespread floo@@ ding to extreme rainf@@ alls , the National Weather Service reported .
the Gover@@ nor of Lou@@ isi@@ ana John B@@ el Edwards announced that civil servants were in constant contact with the local authorities and were already on the road to help the affected communities .
Mike Ste@@ ele , a spokes@@ man for the Office of Hom@@ eland Security and Emergency Prepar@@ edness of the Gover@@ nor , announced that the requests for flood vehicles , boats and sand@@ bags increased .
Ste@@ ele said that the municipality of Tan@@ gi@@ p@@ ah@@ oa alone demanded tens of thousands of sand bags .
a flood warning system is used across large parts in the south of Lou@@ isi@@ ana to Saturday .
the weather service announced that additional 3 to 5 inches of rain could fall in this area .
in the south of Al@@ ab@@ ama a flood warning system was used on Friday , while it was still ra@@ ining in the mobile field .
the river Com@@ ite near Bat@@ on Rou@@ ges and the River Am@@ ite near Den@@ ham Springs , both located in Lou@@ isi@@ ana , will most likely reach record levels over the weekend .
the met@@ er@@ e@@ ologist Ale@@ k Kr@@ aut@@ mann says that both rivers could flood many houses in the suburbs near Bat@@ on Rou@@ ge .
he also said that a stream @-@ downstream flood in Ascension Par@@ ish is a danger , as these flows only slowly into Lake Mau@@ rep@@ as over the tro@@ dden rivers .
the Ti@@ ck@@ fa@@ w River , south of the Miss@@ issi@@ ppi State border in Liverpool , Lou@@ isi@@ ana , reached the highest level ever recorded at 09.@@ 00 on Friday .
rescue teams still sent people out of flood water in the districts of Am@@ ite and Wil@@ kin@@ son in the southwest of Miss@@ issi@@ ppi .
L@@ ero@@ y Hans@@ ford , his wife and his step@@ son were among those who were res@@ cu@@ ed by glo@@ omy on Friday .
Hans@@ ford , 62 , says that water from Be@@ aver Creek , which is normally more than 400 feet away from his house , greatly increased overnight .
he said that he would have warned him of another step @-@ by @-@ step son who lives nearby .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we woke up and the water flow@@ ed and poured in , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Hans@@ ford . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it reached my waist .
his wife said Hans@@ ford , that she had never seen such a high level of the river in the 48 years in which she lived there .
Hans@@ ford said that he and his family members would have all the disabilities and he would be the only one who can swim .
Hans@@ ford said that emergency hel@@ pers would have saved all three in a large military truck and brought them to the next fire station in Glo@@ ster , where they were accommod@@ ated until Friday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kr@@ aut@@ mann said that the flood was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; spread quickly &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; as there were still severe rainf@@ alls and that the authorities would consider ev@@ ac@@ uation instructions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to Kr@@ aut@@ mann , an observer contacted Liv@@ ing@@ stone from midnight to Friday morning of 13.@@ 75 inches of rain .
Kr@@ aut@@ mann said that the soil was considerably balanced by rainf@@ all since Wednesday .
the authorities stated that heavy rainf@@ alls and floo@@ ding caused the rescue of inhabitants from their homes in Tan@@ gi@@ p@@ ah@@ oa Par@@ ish and classroom failure in five schools .
the WW@@ L C@@ BS subsidiary reported that there were 200 floo@@ ded houses in Tan@@ gi@@ p@@ ah@@ oa .
the inhabitants were ev@@ acu@@ ated in two churches , both of which were floo@@ ded .
the leader of the municipality of Rob@@ by Miller said that the authorities would have saved 72 people and seven domestic animals that were washed by the floods .
in the cities of Am@@ ite and Ham@@ mond , emergency shel@@ ters were set up to accommodate the ev@@ ac@@ uation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; once the water begins to go back , they will be able to return to their homes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the town of Ham@@ mond of the municipality of Tan@@ gi@@ p@@ ah@@ oa , almost two dozens of streets were closed due to the high water and sand@@ bags made for the residents to participate , hoping to keep the water out of their houses and shops .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the last big flood we had was in March , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said L@@ acy Land@@ rum from the city administration . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this seems to be a similar incident .
in Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , the emergency manager Ru@@ pert L@@ acy of Har@@ rison Coun@@ t@@ ys said that it was ra@@ ining on the Gulf Coast .
according to his statements , a handful of houses were reported to be floo@@ ded on Thursday but on Friday none were reported .
Kei@@ th Tow@@ n@@ son , Manager at shop@@ per value F@@ oods in Am@@ ite , has been living in the area for 40 years .
&quot; I have seen water in places where I never saw it before , &quot; said Tow@@ n@@ son , &quot; and it still comes . &quot;
Ma@@ ha@@ j Brown , 6 , &quot; enriched by bul@@ lets , &quot; survived shooting in Philadelphia
the police announces that the 6 @-@ year @-@ old boy was shot in Philadelphia , this week already the second time that a 6 year old child is shot .
the grand@@ parents of the boy identified him for C@@ BS Philadelphia as Ma@@ ha@@ j Brown .
the grand@@ parents gave up that Brown suffered several shot injuries , including in the loin , leg , arm and stomach , but that he was in the hospital at his transport to the hospital .
&quot; he has done a lot , his little body was en@@ chan@@ ted by bul@@ lets , &quot; he shared his grand@@ mother Del@@ ores Mel@@ ende@@ z to the transmitter .
I can &apos;t believe it .
the boy &apos;s condition was classified as critical in a hospital and he had to undergo several operations .
the boy &apos;s family told the transmitter that it is expected to recover again .
he would have started the first class in a local elementary school .
brown was one of four people who were shot in German@@ town .
also shot were three men : two at the age of 29 and a 32 @-@ year @-@ old .
one of the 29 @-@ year @-@ old men is in critical condition ; the other two victims are in stable state according to C@@ BS Philadelphia .
the boy was found on the front seat of a car together with the 29 @-@ year @-@ old who finds himself in a critical condition , shot dead , reports the transmitter .
the other two victims were not in the car and the police were investigating whether one of the injured men could be the perpet@@ r@@ ator .
investig@@ ators distributed C@@ BS Philadelphia that it seemed to have come to a cross@@ fire between several arch@@ ers .
cartridge shells for assault ri@@ fl@@ es , which were trac@@ ed back to different storm @-@ guns , over@@ crow@@ ed the crime scene .
it seems that this is clearly a continuing struggle .
on the street , on both sides of the walk@@ way , there were seals .
it seems that there have been several armed fighters who were very active in this area , &quot; said police det@@ ective Anthony Gin@@ al@@ di from the Philadelphia police station .
several houses and vehicles were also found in the area .
there was no arrest and the police are currently checking the surveillance video .
on Tuesday another 6 year old girl was hit by a sc@@ andal at the arm when she played in front of her house in the residential area of the West O@@ ak Lan@@ e .
she reco@@ vers and the police is still searching for a suspect .
why we need Sim@@ one , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie
this is what I imagine at the Women &apos;s Olympics in the gymn@@ as@@ tics and that for more than one reason .
first , I have been with every summer Olympics since 1984 and the US has never been so dominant .
and secondly : this team has three gymn@@ as@@ ins , Sim@@ one Bil@@ es , Gab@@ by Douglas and Lau@@ ren Lau@@ rie &quot; Her@@ nan@@ dez , who worked for many young girls of other skin color .
the structure of this team , the A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man , the Jew is and Ma@@ dison Ko@@ cian , which is ca@@ tho@@ lic , makes everyone proud .
this team finally reflects the US .
it has soli@@ di@@ fied the black and His@@ panic female presence at the top of this sport .
in the last four years the number one among female gymn@@ as@@ tics was an African @-@ American woman .
last year Sim@@ one and Gab@@ by # 1 and # 2 were .
this shows strength .
at the last Olympic Games , Gab@@ by Douglas was a surprise Olympic winner and America .
now the world was able to witness the incredible performance of the triple world champi@@ onships in Sim@@ one Bil@@ es , Douglas and Lau@@ rie Her@@ nan@@ dez as they provided unexpected but master@@ ful gy@@ nec@@ tic routines .
on Thursday Sim@@ one became the fourth h@@ eter@@ os@@ exual American woman who won gold in an individual multi @-@ competition event for women .
team member A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man won silver .
we are experiencing the top of this sport , but so turn @-@ classes across the country do not look like this .
Sim@@ one , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie all beat the same path as A@@ ly and Ma@@ dison to make it into the Olympic team .
they are the &quot; Last Five &quot; because the next Olympic team will only have four female gymn@@ as@@ tics in the team . also , this is the last year with Mart@@ a Kar@@ oly@@ i as a trainer .
but the reality is that gymn@@ as@@ tics are an expensive sport and gymn@@ asts come primarily in private gymn@@ as@@ tics , which are maintained by parents who pay for the training , orientation , travel clothing , competition and hotel costs ( for trainers and their trainers and families ) .
the majority of these gymn@@ as@@ tics are in aff@@ lu@@ ent suburbs that can support the business .
in these clubs the gymn@@ asts get their entire training and this is an expensive and long @-@ term commitment to the families .
A@@ im@@ ee Bo@@ or@@ man , trainer of Sim@@ one Bil@@ es , and Mag@@ gie Han@@ ey , trainer of Lau@@ rie Her@@ nan@@ dez , trained both her athletes since they started the gymn@@ as@@ tics .
we have to provide the communities with inn@@ um@@ erable , young girls who are inspired by Sim@@ one , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie , an affordable and easy @-@ to @-@ reach gymn@@ asi@@ um .
I founded my gymn@@ asi@@ um of 20 years .
at my events , we have offered free and affordable gymn@@ as@@ tics in Harlem for more than 15,000 urban young@@ sters ( especially black and His@@ panic ) and trained national and international vic@@ tors .
in September we will expand to Detroit ( my hom@@ etown ) to offer the youth high quality gymn@@ as@@ tics that deserve the opportunity to learn and benefit from this great Olympic sport .
gymn@@ as@@ tics develop strength , flexibility and coordination for the body as well as hard work , discipline and determination for the mind .
this combination offers lifel@@ ong benefits for health as well as for academic and professional success .
it is the inspiration of this team that attracts thousands of young girls to interest the gymn@@ as@@ tics and that &apos;s great .
it is so important to participate in sports , especially for girls .
this is an exciting time .
thanks Sim@@ one , A@@ ly , Lau@@ rie , Gab@@ by and Ma@@ dison for this real presentation of &quot; Girl Power &quot; by holding the Olympic team gold and thank you for motivated her so many young girls with varying backgrounds to start their way of becoming healthy , strong and successful young women .
veter@@ in@@ arians want to organize more strikes after having rejected Jerem@@ y Hun@@ t &apos;s proposal
the ministers hoped to end the dispute over the changes by adop@@ ting a re@@ formed contract with the function@@ aries of the British Medical Association , but 58 percent of the 3@@ 7.@@ 000 resident doctors who voted in favour of a vote refused him .
in July Hun@@ t plans had revealed plans to forci@@ bly introduce the Treaty and said that the N@@ HS would be in a &quot; Ni@@ em@@ and@@ s@@ land &quot; and any further delay would be harmful to the employees and patients .
the first veter@@ in@@ arians are to receive a new contract , which includes changes to night and weekend supplements in order to improve the maintenance at irregular times .
Dr Ellen Mc@@ Court , Chairman of the B@@ MA Committee for Assistant Doc@@ tors , announced last night in a communication with : &quot; veter@@ in@@ arians tend to have serious concerns about the proposed contract , in particular that it will heat up the current occupancy crisis and will admini@@ ster it to meet all doctors . &quot;
with only eight weeks remaining until the first group of doctors fall under the new contract , progress must be made and the time runs out .
efforts on the part of the B@@ MA to resolve disputes clas@@ hed with the government on behalf of reluc@@ tance and sometimes on de@@ af@@ ening silence .
this was due to a promise by Jerem@@ y Hun@@ t last month that his door would always be open .
Jerem@@ y Hun@@ t must act now to raise the condition and address the worries of the resident doctors . &quot;
should he not do so , the resident doctors have made it clear that they are willing to carry out further training measures .
the last strike at the end of April saw a postpon@@ ement of nearly 13@@ ,000 routine operations and 100,000 appointments , as nur@@ ses and veter@@ in@@ arians were involved to provide coverage for doctors on the strike .
the ministers hoped to end the dispute over the changes by adop@@ ting the re@@ formed contract with the function@@ aries of the British Medical Association .
the B@@ MA wants a better weekend pay for the 5@@ 4.000 resident doctors who are subject to the contract .
Daniel Mor@@ timer , General Director of the N@@ HS employees , requested the assistance doctors to stop the strike .
Mor@@ timer said : &quot; working combat measures do not only achieve a little but strain heavily loaded teams and service providers , and prepare the patients , car@@ egi@@ vers and their families only worries , need and interruption . &quot;
over the last two months , we talked to the committee of the assistance doctors and responded positively to the concerns about guar@@ di@@ an@@ ship and whi@@ st@@ leb@@ low@@ ings with the Ministry of Health and other mini@@ stries .
the employers hoped that the continued positive commitment to other important topics - such as posting , flexibility in training , additional training for those who return from a vocational training time , training rests , mutual recognition of the curriculum , training certificates , mutual recognition of the curriculum , training certificates , mutual recognition of the curriculum , training certificates , mutual recognition of the curriculum in November , February and May .
the £ 2 @-@ per day medicine that can reduce heart attack risk
thousands of heart attack patients will benefit from a £ 2 @-@ per day medicine , recommended by the authorities to admini@@ ster this more people for a longer period of time .
the anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ant medication T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or reduces the risk of repeated heart attacks for people with heart disease .
the drug is administered for 12 months after a heart attack , thereby reducing the risk of stroke or other heart attacks .
the N@@ HS regulatory authority has recommended a four @-@ year intake to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems .
the N@@ HS regulatory authority has recommended a four @-@ year intake to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems .
around 14@@ 0,000 people suffer a heart attack every year and a quarter of them suffer from a further heart attack or stroke .
heart attacks and stro@@ kes are caused by accum@@ ulations of fatty material in the ar@@ tery walls which form bel@@ lows .
if the t@@ opping breaks apart , it can cause a blood cl@@ ots that c@@ logged the blood flow to the heart and thereby cause a heart attack .
when the blood c@@ lot triggers , it can flow through the blood stream and clo@@ g the blood flow to the brain , causing a stroke .
persons who have already had a heart attack are subject to a higher risk of having another .
T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or , which is produced by the British company A@@ stra@@ Zen@@ eca and is marketed under the trade name Bri@@ li@@ que , reduces this risk by making the formation of blood cl@@ ots unlikely .
the draft of N@@ ICE , which was published today , recommends a 12 month intake of 90@@ mg T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or , followed by 60@@ mg with a twice daily intake of aspir@@ in for the next three years .
Professor Car@@ ole Long@@ son , Director of the N@@ ICE health technology evaluation centre said : &quot; despite the availability of secondary prevention , a quarter of all those who have suffered a heart attack have another heart attack or a stroke - often with disa@@ strous consequences . &quot;
the fear of a renewed heart attack can have significant negative effects on the quality of life of a person .
the experience shows that in combination with aspir@@ in , T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or is effective in reducing other heart attacks and stro@@ kes in people who already had a heart attack .
due to a preliminary recommendation of T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or we are pleased that we are able to extend available treatment options to thousands of people who can benefit from it .
the information on efficacy and safety of T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or - especially the risk of bleeding - is limited to a period of up to three years .
culture of Political Cor@@ rect@@ ness flour@@ ishes in Muslim areas
former Mayor of Tower Ham@@ lets Lut@@ on Rah@@ man was removed last year for the dis@@ miss@@ al of a government report on corruption from office
a culture of Political Cor@@ rect@@ ness has led to the fact that widespread electoral fraud in Muslim communities is know@@ ingly ignored , as a devastating government report today revealed .
the former cabinet member Sir Eric Pick@@ les verb@@ ally attacks the police , election ob@@ servers and town coun@@ cils to have ignored evidence of electoral abuse due to &quot; hyper@@ sensitivity to eth@@ ni@@ city and religion . &quot;
the former minister of integration and municipal government , who is now a antagon@@ ist , said that the in@@ timi@@ dation of voters from religious motives would be so bad that the police should be allowed to set up shut @-@ off bands outside of electoral cabins to protect in@@ timi@@ dated voters .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he recommends voters should take a badge to prove their identity in elections . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the moment , a vot@@ er only needs to name his name and address .
the report suggests not to apply removable ink on a person &apos;s finger when they vote their votes in order to prevent someone from choosing twice .
whi@@ st@@ leb@@ lower should receive more protection , says Sir Eric .
it demands that the press should have more access to congreg@@ ational documents and decisions of non @-@ official committees or working groups .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this serves not only against electoral fraud , but also to protect the local government against the broader corruption and financial fraud associated with it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the report was arranged by Dow@@ ning Street as a result of Tower Ham@@ lets El@@ ection Sc@@ andal in the east of London .
last year , a special voting court decided that the acting mayor Lut@@ on Rah@@ man should be reli@@ eved after a lit@@ any of corrupt and illegal practices of his ministry .
the Court found that Rah@@ man had per@@ ver@@ ted the religious feelings of his Muslim community in a cy@@ ni@@ cal way and that he had sil@@ enced his critics with rac@@ ism and Islam@@ opho@@ bia accus@@ ations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Rah@@ man allegedly led &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; his campaign on the basis that it is the religious duty of Muslims to choose him . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
up to 300 voices were either doub@@ t@@ ful or the result of im@@ itation , in which a person el@@ ects as someone else .
Sir Eric said that there would be evidence in the whole country for fraud .
he expressed in particular alar@@ ming to the frau@@ dul@@ ent letter of letters - when the older members of the Muslim community had made pressure on people to choose a candidate of their choice .
Sir Eric , pic@@ tured , made several recommendations to clean the electoral system , including leading ID cards to prove the identity
in his report it says : &quot; as proof it was appropriate that pressure on vulnerable members of some ethnic minorities was exercised , especially women and young people , in order to choose according to the will of the elderly , in particular communities with Pak@@ ist@@ ani or Banglad@@ es@@ hi background .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there were concerns that state institutions had know@@ ingly ignored such behaviour because of &quot; politically correct &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hyper@@ sensitivity to eth@@ ni@@ city and religion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Sir Eric explained 50 recommendations to clean up the system , including the prohibition that political activists edit postal voting documents in order to stop &quot; re@@ aping . &quot;
the report submitted by Ther@@ esa May also requires tough@@ er registration checks to prevent the electoral register being used for immigration and social fraud purposes .
consider options to ask voters before choosing your ID .
do not use removable ink on a person &apos;s finger as soon as she has handed her voice to prevent someone from choosing twice .
systematic reviews of the nationality of a person to ensure that they are eligible .
a three @-@ year limitation to applications for automatic letter selection .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ban that political activists edit full postal elections and envel@@ opes from letter elections . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the police force the authority to set up lock@@ outs for election stations .
a change of law that facilitates an accus@@ ation of in@@ timi@@ dation in accordance with the Act of Repres@@ entation of the People Act in 1983 .
prohibition of photograph@@ ing in election stations .
request that only English may be used in the election stations ( except for Wales ) .
intensi@@ fying the training to ensure that the employees rule out that voters go alone in the election cabin .
Sir Eric falls over the Metropolitan Police and finds it &apos; amazing &apos; that after the Tower Ham@@ lets case no complaint was placed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the electoral court has said Lut@@ on Rah@@ man and his deputy for a lit@@ any of corrupt and illegal practices , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he was found guilty on the basis of a number of reasons - in accordance with the high standards of criminal law .
he also critic@@ ises the in@@ effective &quot; check@@ points &quot; of the election registration departments of the town halls .
Sir Eric said : &quot; the court ruling in Tower Ham@@ lets from last year was a warning signal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our country is a proud heir to the mother of parliam@@ ents , but the wor@@ rying and cover@@ t spread of electoral fraud and den@@ ial of some authorities thre@@ aten this good reputation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
crazy to K@@ ate Rad@@ ler @-@ Doppel@@ gän@@ ger and other famous Doppel@@ gän@@ ger of Olympi@@ as@@ port@@ lern in Rio
fans of the 2016 Olympic Games in Rio have advised the French cycli@@ st Pau@@ line Ferr@@ and @-@ PRE@@ VO@@ T as an impressive Doppel@@ gän@@ ger of the Du@@ chess of Cambridge .
but the 24 @-@ year @-@ old Olympi@@ oni@@ kin is by far not the only one who has its own famous Doppel@@ gän@@ ger , who has its own famous Doppel@@ gän@@ ger - at least not if one is allowed to believe the social media .
in honour of the Olympic Games in Rio and all the famous faces fli@@ ck@@ ering on our screens , F@@ email has created a list of Olympi@@ ans that show more than just a certain simil@@ arity with Hollywood celeb@@ ri@@ ties .
the h@@ unter and the wolf : team member of the U.S. team in arch@@ ery Bra@@ dy El@@ li@@ son , left , is compared since his childhood with Leonardo Di@@ Cap@@ rio
apart from K@@ ate &apos;s Doppel@@ gän@@ ger on the rac@@ et@@ rack , many people on the Internet pointed out how a certain ar@@ cher of the twin of A @-@ Pro@@ mi Leonardo Di@@ Cap@@ rio could be .
the team member of the U.S. team in arch@@ ery Bra@@ dy El@@ li@@ son caused a storm on Twitter after images on which he looks similar to the Wolf of Wall Street Star .
in fact , the ar@@ cher got the ma@@ dness in the social media and admitted that he had already heard since his childhood that he looks like Leo .
&quot; I don &apos;t see any simil@@ arity with the exception of facial hair , &quot; Bra@@ dy shared the Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is a good looking guy , so I guess it &apos;s a compli@@ ment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
one of the most popular compar@@ isons since London 2012 will undoubtedly be the focus of this year : the striking simil@@ arity between the British Wei@@ t@@ spr@@ inger Gre@@ g Ru@@ ther@@ ford and the popular actor N@@ eil Patrick Har@@ ris .
the Russian gymn@@ ast Ali@@ ya Must@@ afa with her large , expressive eyes will be able to go through as a Doppel@@ gän@@ ger for the Cu@@ ban @-@ American singer Gl@@ oria Est@@ ef@@ an .
and in the swimming pool , the South African s@@ wimm@@ ers Cameron van der Bur@@ gh has been compared with G@@ le@@ e Star Matthew Mor@@ rison for years .
one gear higher : this user thinks that Nathan is the &quot; athle@@ tic version &quot; of the In@@ c@@ eption actor
another more persistent comparison was drawn between the tennis star Raf@@ ael Nad@@ al and actor Jos@@ h Hart@@ man , who shows similarly severe ey@@ eb@@ rows and lips .
the Russian silver med@@ alli@@ st Y@@ uli@@ a E@@ fi@@ mo@@ va shows more than just the sun@@ tann@@ ed skin and bl@@ ond hair like the act@@ ress Ann@@ aly@@ n@@ ne Mc@@ C@@ ord , while Nathan Adrian was att@@ ested by fans to compensate for an &quot; athle@@ tic version of Joseph Gordon Lev@@ itt . &quot;
strong women : football star Hope Solo , left , and D@@ ex@@ ter act@@ ress J@@ enni@@ fer Car@@ p@@ enter , right , have a similar facial form and eyes
not the only one : a Twitter user was very happy that others have noticed the simil@@ arities
theory in the room : according to this user , there may be a reason for the simil@@ arity of the couple .
a Twitter user explained their satisfaction that &quot; the rest of the internet thinks that Hope Solo and J@@ enni@@ fer Car@@ p@@ enter are almost identical . &quot;
in fact , the US football star Hope Solo and the D@@ ex@@ ter act@@ ress J@@ enni@@ fer Car@@ p@@ enter have an incredibly similar facial form and eyes .
other popular compar@@ isons included K@@ err@@ i Wal@@ sh J@@ enn@@ ings and her smile , which is almost identical to that of act@@ ress Laura Lin@@ ney as well as the gold medal winner in Tur@@ ning Gab@@ by Douglas , who has her own beautiful , broad smile , similar to that of Br@@ ing It On Star Gabri@@ elle Union .

the comment@@ ator By@@ ron Mac@@ Don@@ al@@ ds thought that his microphone was off when at the end of the 4x@@ 200m free @-@ style swimming pool he had his own opinions .
Mac@@ Donald , who had been brought aboard the C@@ BS commentary team to give more &quot; colour , &quot; could be heard say : &quot; this little 14 @-@ year @-@ old chin@@ ese has lost the connection , baby . &quot;
too excited he went like a s@@ wine , died like a pig .
thank you for that .
the Chinese swi@@ mmer Ai Yan@@ is , 14 , sw@@ am the second stage of the swimming pool 1 : 5@@ 7,@@ 79 - 1,@@ 61 seconds slower than Canada &apos;s Taylor Ru@@ ck , which enabled the Canadian to close the gap to China .
spectators across Canada quickly re@@ acted online after they were shocked by the sound and the language
Emma &apos;s Mac@@ far@@ away twe@@ ete , &quot; H@@ as the C@@ BC comment@@ ator has just said that the 14 @-@ year @-@ old s@@ wimm@@ ers from China &quot; died like a pig ? ? ? ? ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the I@@ di@@ ot has not broken that they were still on air . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ai Yan@@ is from China was described in the final 4 x 200m free @-@ style swimming pool for women as follows : &quot; this little 14 @-@ year @-@ old Chinese woman has lost the connection , baby . &quot;
the criticism against By@@ ron Mac@@ Donald on Twitter came quickly and hard , with which many people asked him
Twitter users were not back when they heard how in@@ sensitive By@@ ron Mac@@ don@@ ald was
another Twitter user in Sarah Paradi@@ s wrote : &quot; w@@ ow , # By@@ ron Mac@@ Donald .
you represent the C@@ BC and Canada and lets us all look like ra@@ cists . # ange@@ ek@@ elt .
a short time later , Scott Russ@@ el , who hosted the C@@ BC broadcast live for the commentary by Mac@@ don@@ ald , said : &quot; we are sorry that the comment on a swimming achievement was broadcast . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was an un@@ fortunate choice , I &apos;m sorry that it happened . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
C@@ BC ap@@ ologi@@ zed at the end of 90 times with the people who answered the B@@ emer@@ ze on Twitter
the comment colleague Scott Russ@@ el had to ap@@ ologi@@ ze in the name of Mac@@ Donald .
C@@ BC copied and added his ap@@ ologies to more than 90 other Twitter users who compl@@ ained about Mac@@ Donald &apos;s comments
the network also ap@@ ologi@@ zed quickly and issued a message .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we sincer@@ ely regret that these statements were made and that it was possible for them to be broadcast . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we ap@@ ologi@@ zed very quickly yesterday night with our viewers on mission and our followers in the social media .
to clarify one , B@@ yr@@ on &apos;s comments related to the performance of s@@ wimm@@ ers and not on them as a person .
nevertheless they were in@@ appropriate and an un@@ happy chosen formulation . By@@ ron does what he said , very sorry .
on Thursday afternoon Mac@@ don@@ ald exc@@ used in the mission and tried to justify his re@@ mark by saying that it was not his intention that it was designed as a personal attack .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I would like to take a moment to ap@@ ologi@@ ze for the comment I made after the women &apos;s swimming pool in the C@@ BC Olympics . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have referred to the performance of the s@@ wimm@@ ers and not to them as a person . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
of course , no cont@@ emp@@ t was intended and I am very sorry . &quot;
buyer in Pri@@ mark indign@@ ant about woman buying sham@@ elessly under@@ wear in the middle of the shop
the buyers did not know where to look , when a woman drew up her clothes in the middle of a pri@@ mark to try under@@ pants .
to ag@@ grav@@ ate the situation , she looked out how she looked at it , drew her out and put her back on the shelf .
she moved on and tried four pairs of under@@ pants in a shop at the Bou@@ ver@@ ie Place Shopping Centre in Folk@@ estone .
the pri@@ mark shop in the Bou@@ ver@@ ie Place Shopping Centre in Folk@@ estone , where the woman tried the under@@ pants before she put them back into the shelf
a mother of two children , J@@ enny Davi@@ dson , who was in the business at the same time , said that after the mysterious woman tried under@@ wear , &quot; she went back and left the business without buying anything . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; people couldn &apos;t believe what they saw . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
standing in the middle of the sales area , she took a pair of under@@ pants from the outside , pulled out her own trousers and pants and tried them .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she did not even try to find a rather dis@@ crete place to do it - she just stood there , che@@ ek@@ y like O@@ sk@@ ar . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; everyone star@@ ed when she pulled out the pants that you obviously didn &apos;t like , as she put her back on the shelf . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
she repeated the same with three further under@@ pants before she finally decided that she didn &apos;t like anything to und@@ ress and go out again .
&quot; she didn &apos;t seem to distur@@ b anyone observing - or thinking about the person who would possibly buy the under@@ pants that she had tried . &quot;
Mrs. Davi@@ dson , 33 , who lives in K@@ ent , said : &quot; how reluc@@ t@@ antly to think that someone would take shelter with home that had another person and who were not washed . &quot;
the incident occurred on Tuesday afternoon .
Mrs. Davi@@ dson added : &quot; as I received , the employees have tried to pull the pieces of clothing from the sale after they went - which is just as good . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I would hate to go home with a new pair of under@@ pants and find out that another woman had her and pulled out and did not wash them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a spokes@@ man from Pri@@ mark said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pri@@ mark is aware of the incident that took place on Tuesday 9 August at our branch in Folk@@ stone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
all products coming into question were withdrawn from the sale .
how to protect yourself from weapons attacks with Kra@@ v Mag@@ a
the world outside is a dangerous place , but this video by Dail@@ y@@ mail@@ .com could make it a bit safer for you .
we spoke with Rh@@ one Miz@@ ra@@ chi , a Grand Master of the Kra@@ v Mag@@ a Association in New York to find out how to deal with armed rob@@ bers at close distance .
regardless of whether you &apos;re approaching from front or back , this video will show you how to turn the sk@@ ewer around for your rob@@ ber .
if you look back from behind , you should turn around as first so that you can see your attack@@ er and go out of the shot line , &quot; says Miz@@ ra@@ chi .
then seize the weapon between your for@@ ear@@ m and your shoulder before hitting him with your free el@@ bow .
kno@@ ck it with your knee in the bar and twist , while the aggres@@ sor ro@@ ams from pain , the weapon out of his hands . hit him with the barrel in the face and move backwards while they strai@@ gh@@ ten the weapon on him .
with aggres@@ sors , approaching from the front , the technique is similar - move your body out of the shot , seize the weapon and twist it so that the attack@@ er can &apos;t shoot .
shift the weight to the weapon at the same time and hit the Att@@ acker on the chest , then twist the weapon out of its grip before moving backwards and the weapon to strai@@ gh@@ ten it .
sounds difficult ?
watch the video to see exactly how it &apos;s done in Miz@@ ra@@ chi .
but remember that in a rob@@ ber@@ y it is the saf@@ est way to transfer your money - if you are not a Kra@@ v Mag@@ a Grand Master .
traveler Ian W@@ right sch@@ ab@@ t for a gu@@ ide@@ book his tongue at the dir@@ ti@@ est places in Europe
a British trav@@ eller under@@ lined his immune system and stran@@ gen@@ ess of a serious test - taking some of the dir@@ ti@@ est and most disgu@@ sting places in Europe .
the moder@@ ator and author Ian W@@ right , 51 , from Su@@ ff@@ ol@@ k scra@@ pped his course on a euro note , a rail@@ ing at Pic@@ ca@@ dil@@ ly Circus , a sink of a train toilet and a public phone in Russia to prove the resili@@ ence of his immune system .
before leak@@ age of each object , he used a lumin@@ ometer to show himself and to show us what he is getting involved .
but the experiment , which was filmed under the title &quot; The Li@@ ck@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to In@@ ner Str@@ ength , &quot; brought some surprising results .
the thought of rej@@ ecting the r@@ ins@@ ing button of a pull toilet that has been used by thousands of others may be totally distra@@ c@@ ting , but actually there are more bad bacteria in a kitchen sink .
on his journey across Europe , Mr. W@@ right talked to doctors and medical professionals about the promotion of intestinal bacteria as well as about his own health .
fortunately nothing left what he li@@ cked , more than a bad taste in the mouth .
Mr. W@@ right was known to test the resili@@ ence of his bow@@ el by travelling through the world and ate peculiar and wonderful things .
from public funds to stations up to sin@@ ks of toilets , the task posed its immune system defini@@ tively under a sample
in the film he said : &quot; as a child I was relatively un@@ concerned about my health and I have put all sorts of things into my mouth , earth , worms and mud water . &quot;
in the film , he was justified in his call .
the only thing he refused was a dirty public toilet in Russia .
his test scre@@ ed showed a lumin@@ ometric number of more than 4000 units .
in comparison to this , the lumin@@ ometric number of freshly washed hands is less than 60 .
but there was a Russian toilet which he refused to refuse after its lumin@@ ometric number exceeded 4000 units while freshly washed hands have one of less than 60 .
W@@ right and Finnish manufacturer of dairy products Vali@@ o produced the travel film &quot; The Li@@ ck@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to In@@ ner Str@@ ength , &quot; which shows the number of bacteria in different places like the bathroom
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the film he says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is close to the worst that I have in a toilet . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is nothing more than that !
I &apos;m not going to lick here because it &apos;s disgu@@ sting here .
&quot; the Li@@ ck@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to In@@ ner Str@@ ength &quot; was produced in collaboration with the Finnish manufacturer of dairy products Vali@@ o .
the company equi@@ ps Mr. W@@ right with Vali@@ o Gef@@ il@@ us , which contains lac@@ tic acid bacteria as well as vitamin C and D to support the promotion of intestinal bacteria and immune system .
vali@@ os Senior Venice President for snacks , juices and new categories Ni@@ ko Vu@@ or@@ en@@ ma@@ a says : &quot; we really wanted to offer consumers something new .
something that is fascinating to look at and at the same time explain the advantages of pro@@ biot@@ ics .
we performed crazy bra@@ inst@@ or@@ ming that ended up saying &quot; Let &apos;s call Ian . &quot;
they claim that the interest in intestinal health is becoming a global phenomenon
instead of talking about the products , we wanted to put them into a larger context - the good and bad bacteria in our everyday surroundings , the importance of gut health and how it is associated with the immune system .
the growing interest in gut health is a global phenomenon and with the documentary we were able to provide consumers with more information in an interesting way .
I also think the film shows that we have a great sense of hum@@ our !
Tom Hak@@ ala , who directed the film , added : &quot; let me say so - I would have lost my respect for Ian , if he had checked out some of the things I have instructed him to lick , like the disgu@@ sting Russian toilet that is shown in the film . &quot;
of course there were things in which it was easier to get Ian to lick her out and others , in which this was quite difficult .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m glad we recorded some of these dirty treats on film . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in a survey conducted by Vali@@ o in 2015 , 84 percent of all respon@@ dents associated lac@@ tic acid bacteria associated with the well @-@ being of stomach and intest@@ ines and 58 percent said they use at least occasionally products containing attached lac@@ tic acid bacteria .
as@@ o@@ ci@@ ale family destroyed in front of Del@@ o@@ ge &apos;s social apartment in S@@ alt@@ ash , Corn@@ wall
an as@@ o@@ ci@@ dal family left their social apartment after del@@ o@@ ading with a damage in the amount of £ 50,000 because it had terr@@ orized its neighbors .
T@@ anya Skel@@ don and her partner Sh@@ au@@ n Tre@@ bil@@ cock were thrown after a long list of complaints from their estate in S@@ alt@@ ash , Corn@@ wall .
after they were forci@@ bly removed from their property , shocked employees of the housing cooperative found the property in an ir@@ repar@@ able condition .
the walls pointed plain@@ tive holes , wood panels were torn up , rub@@ b@@ ish was scattered on the floor and gra@@ ff@@ iti was s@@ me@@ ared to the walls .
the family has been res@@ ett@@ led and it is assumed that they are now living in a private accommodation
Don@@ na Mc@@ E@@ vo@@ y , who works for home management at Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing , said she fears that the apartment is no longer available .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; It was an absolute night@@ mare for the people here and I think people don &apos;t have to live this way . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are many things to consider as this property is thought to be considered not so beautiful part of Corn@@ wall .
the family is not@@ orious and their reputation is likewise .
the couple had three sons who lived in the apartment in the meantime and the police said that the terror which the family had inflic@@ ted , street fights with bas@@ eball bat , in@@ timi@@ dation of residents , drug abuse , drug traffi@@ cking and excessive scre@@ aming , stri@@ ped and cur@@ sing .
Skel@@ don , 47 , whose name was on the lease , got an arrangement for anti @-@ social behavior in June .
in some rooms of the house , which may be torn down under certain circumstances , old rub@@ b@@ ish was found
in the estate in which drugs were tra@@ ded in the past , the wooden boards were torn
neighbors said they had to fight them on the street and regularly call the police to be inv@@ oked .
Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing led her and her partner by force this week , after giving them an extended deadline of 11 weeks to volunteer .
the Del@@ o@@ gi@@ ans were che@@ ered by ligh@@ tened neighbours who said their life was going to hell .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; They were not fighting for anybody . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we lived 20 years next to them and it was always bad .
the countless times we have the police here are incredible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we couldn &apos;t sleep this morning . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we stood up because it was so quiet here - we are not used to it !
now that they are finally gone , it will be nice .
Adam F@@ itz@@ patri@@ ck , N@@ eigh@@ bour@@ hood En@@ forcement Managers of Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing , stated that it would have ab@@ used the family to cooperate with local authorities .
the family lived in the house where the police were called at regular intervals for 20 years
rub@@ b@@ ish and old toys were thrown down on the over@@ grown side of the church building .
he added : &quot; it is a shame that the les@@ see ab@@ used to accept any responsibility for their behavior and family because del@@ o@@ aling is always the final step to consider Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing .
this was a very difficult case because the behaviour was extreme and their actions for their neighbours had to be horri@@ ble .
I appreciate all the work my team , the police of De@@ von and Corn@@ wall as well as members of the community who have cour@@ age@@ ously approached us and have provided us with the information .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I hope that this development will give comfort to some neighbours and the message conve@@ ys that anti@@ social behaviour is not tolerated . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
F@@ itz@@ patri@@ ck said that all three sons had lived in the house at different times , but that they were all over 20 .
a dirty mattress that is left behind in one of the bedrooms of the house after del@@ ousing on the floor
workers of the house administration will now have to swe@@ ep away garbage mountains that surround the house
in 2014 , the police launched a raid in the house and found over 70 grams of cannabis as well as balances , par@@ ap@@ her@@ n@@ alia and cash in the amount of £ 1,@@ 700 .
Skel@@ don received a fine after she ple@@ aded not guilty to the owner of a class B drug in commercial law .
she claimed that the money was a tom@@ bst@@ one of her son Lee Skel@@ don , who died in 2013 in a car accident .
after being homeless , T@@ anya and her partner are now living in a private accommodation in Pl@@ ym@@ outh .
many of the walls of the house were gra@@ ff@@ iti .
the police say that they will deleg@@ ate ten@@ ants who do not abide by the house rules
the police of De@@ von and Corn@@ wall informed Angela C@@ row that del@@ o@@ gi@@ ation is a clear warning to the other ten@@ ants who do not obey house rules .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this goes to those who think that they can behave without self @-@ reproach , as well as those who have been har@@ med by such behavior . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the De@@ von and Corn@@ wall police will never tolerate criminal and anti @-@ social behaviour that will continue to work with partners to protect our communities .
tourists in Portugal in panic sent after an eff@@ or@@ tless military jet beach flies
sun wor@@ ship@@ pers in Av@@ eiro , Portugal experienced the shock of their lives
a portu@@ guese P @-@ 3@@ C Ori@@ on aircraft of the air forces placed an incredible storm flight
the air forces admitted that it was on a training flight , but insist@@ ed that there was no security risk .
this was the moment in which frigh@@ tened tourists start to panic after an eff@@ or@@ tless jet crashing over a full beach .
dramatic video footage showed how the military plane flew close to the beach in Av@@ eiro in the north of Portugal .
the vac@@ ation@@ ers sprang up when they were understand@@ ably beginning to worry about the noise of the nozzle @-@ engines without first seeing what was coming through the clouds .
the incident occurred yesterday afternoon in Costa Nova , near Av@@ eiro .
Daniel Fern@@ andes , one of the many vac@@ ation@@ ers who posted videos on the dramatic F@@ ly @-@ By in social media , said : &quot; it flew very deep twice and there was a moment when it looked like it would crash . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; N@@ un@@ o Ar@@ ro@@ ja added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was just surfing and it felt like the plane would fall down on me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
tourists at the beach of Av@@ eiro were in panic when the plane came out of the darkness and flew incredibly low
the Portuguese Air Force announced today that the pilot of the P @-@ 3@@ C Ori@@ on plane was on a training flight to identify fis@@ her boats off the coast and thus fly so deep that this was the only way to recognize them .
the speaker said that due to the bad visibility of the surface area the jet flew more deeply than usual , but the air forces insist@@ ed that safety at no time was at risk .
area fires destroyed parts of the Portuguese mainland this summer , in which also four people came to death on the island of Madeira .
the Portuguese Air Force today announced that the pilot had to fly so deeply because of the conditions - strong fog and smoke - which restric@@ ts his view
the plane was on a training flight where the pilot needed to identify fis@@ her boats as part of the exercise
Super@@ cup : Bar@@ ca with worries about Sev@@ ille
Sevilla - FC Barcelona is fighting for the first time on Sunday for the first time in the new football season .
the Catal@@ ans compete in the du@@ el around the Spanish Super@@ cup towards FC Sevilla , the back@@ lash climb@@ s three days later at Camp No@@ u .
the Dou@@ ble@@ W@@ inner has to ren@@ ounce the Olympic football tournament in balance with the defeated Cup fin@@ alist and reig@@ ning European League Champion among others on N@@ ey@@ mar , who is competing with Brazil for the Olympic Football tournament .
in addition , Go@@ alie Marc @-@ Andr@@ e ter St@@ egen is missing .
the German suffered a b@@ anding in the knee in the training , which at least initially clari@@ fied the demand for Bar@@ ca in favour of Claudio Bra@@ vo .
the Chil@@ ean International and T@@ er St@@ egen in Barcelona have been competing for the status as number one for two years .
in this respect , coach Luis En@@ rique gave up a clear decision , leaving Bra@@ vo in the league , but T@@ er St@@ egen in most of the other applications .
before the first mandatory game of the new season , the Spanish master doubts about the fitness of the team , which was humili@@ ated on Saturday in a Liverpool test game with 0 : 4 .
Li@@ onel Mess@@ i and Co. didn &apos;t really convince even at the 3 : 2 stop at S@@ amp@@ d@@ oria on Wednesday .
Sevilla , again , has the 2 : 3 defeat after extension in the European Super@@ cup against Real Madrid to di@@ gest and stri@@ ves for the second triumph at the &quot; Super@@ cop@@ a de Esp@@ ana . &quot;
with up to now , Barcelona is the record winner in this competition .
Ma Long in a separate league to table tennis gold
Rio de Jan@@ eiro - The Chinese Ma Long is the new table tennis champion .
the 27 @-@ year @-@ old defeated his comp@@ atri@@ ot and &quot; defending champion &quot; Z@@ hang Ji@@ ke 4 : 0 on Thursday in Rio de Jan@@ eiro .
thus , the World Ran@@ king First took the Golden Grand S@@ lam with successes at World Cup , World Cup , World Tour Fin@@ al@@ tur@@ nier and just Olympics .
bronze went to Japanese Ju@@ n Mi@@ th@@ ani .
the two Chinese managed to get into the final game as expected and made the title among themselves .
thus it was clear that for the third time in a row , a Chinese would fetch the single title in the sign of the Five rings .
last non @-@ Chinese at the top Olympic stand was the former SV@@ S @-@ N@@ Ö Legi@@ on@@ ary Ry@@ u Se@@ ung @-@ min from South Korea .
Ma and Z@@ hang were left alone on the plate , between the sentences and with time @-@ outs they had no coaches .
they had withdrawn on the tri@@ b@@ une and left their guns on their own in a fair competition .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the matches until now have I played for my country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; in the final , I play for myself , &quot; Z@@ hang said in a logical way .
after the match , gold and silver med@@ alists posed with the China flag .
the match itself was un@@ expect@@ edly un@@ il@@ ater@@ ally one @-@ sided .
Ma had really to fight with his 28 @-@ year @-@ old opponent only in the first sentence .
after that he set the pace on the plate and left Z@@ hang only a total of 13 points .
due to the superi@@ ority of Ma did not develop the expected ro@@ using match .
nevertheless , there were enough breathtaking ballo@@ ons to be seen .
Mi@@ th@@ ani won the game for bronze against the 40 @-@ year @-@ old Vladimir Sam@@ son@@ ow 4 : 1 .
in the quar@@ ter@@ fin@@ als of the European champion Dimit@@ ri@@ j Ov@@ t@@ char@@ ov , the White @-@ rus@@ se had contracted a breach of ri@@ b , after that was in medical treatment , had to settle &quot; ultimately &quot; with sheet metal .
inci@@ dentally , the Swe@@ des Jan @-@ O@@ ve Wald@@ ner ( 38 / 2004 ) and Jör@@ gen Pers@@ son ( 42 / 2008 ) had become Olympic @-@ Fourth in similarly high table tennis .
Donald Tr@@ ump ad@@ mits &quot; mighty problems &quot; in the election campaign
the leadership of the US Republi@@ cans is pl@@ agu@@ ed by massive concerns , even in traditional conservative states .
presidential candidate Donald Tr@@ ump now admitted weaknesses of his campaign in the former republi@@ can stron@@ gh@@ old U@@ tah .
a rare moment in which the mul@@ tim@@ il@@ li@@ on@@ aire , normally large @-@ gauge and self @-@ confident , expressed as little as concerns , as correspon@@ dents reported .
after having thrown 16 ri@@ vals out of the race within his own republi@@ can camp , the doubts about his success in the struggle for the White House are now growing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have huge problems in U@@ tah , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Tr@@ ump in front of evangel@@ ical Christians who asked for support in important states like Ohio , Florida or Virginia . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
guilt was false reports on his can@@ did@@ acy , he resum@@ ed his well @-@ known media .
republi@@ can stron@@ gh@@ olds w@@ ob@@ ble
U@@ tah is usually a secure bank for the Republi@@ cans .
according to a survey by Surv@@ ey@@ USA from June , Tr@@ ump and his competi@@ tor were of the Democrats , H@@ illary Clinton .
other institutions see Tr@@ ump in the front , but not with the distance that can be used for Republi@@ can candidates in the state .
Arizona and Georgia are considered to be endangered .
in an interview with CN@@ BC , Tr@@ ump answered the question how to stop the advance of Clin@@ tons : &quot; just as I have done so far . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and whether afterwards : this will be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; either successful or I will make a very very nice , long holiday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he makes no difference to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tell the truth . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if it did not suff@@ ice for him at the end for reasons of political correctness , that was fine , said Tr@@ ump .
then I return to a very good way of life .
according to press reports , the Tr@@ ump party is said to have threatened to aboli@@ sh money in support of its campaign , it should not present better poll@@ s .
instead of this , the candidates of the Republi@@ cans would be stronger than the arms for Congress .
Olympic : three Sc@@ am in Dop@@ ing Test
the IO@@ C wants to establish a disciplinary committee on the event .
Kenya &apos;s athletes face the second dop@@ ing affair at the Rio de Jan@@ eiro event .
after an attempt at a dop@@ ing control in the Olympic village , Kenya has sent a trainer home .
the International Olympic Committee agreed to immediately set up a disciplinary committee in order to investigate the case .
a Ken@@ yan function@@ ary had informed that the former Spr@@ inter and today &apos;s coach , John An@@ z@@ rah , gave a urine sample in the Olympic village under the name of the 800 @-@ meter @-@ runner F@@ erg@@ us@@ on Rot@@ ich .
this was reported to the K@@ eni@@ as team management of the dop@@ ing controllers .
the IA@@ AF World Federation sent the IO@@ C information on the case in order to ex@@ ert its own investigations , an IA@@ AF spokesperson .
&quot; depending on the results of the study and the following measures undertaken by the IO@@ C , IA@@ AF will make an assessment , &quot; he stated in an IA@@ AF explanation .
&quot; he ( An@@ z@@ rah ) went to the dop@@ ing control station and has spent himself as F@@ erg@@ us@@ on Rot@@ i , released the sample and signed , &quot; declared K@@ eni@@ as Chief of Mission Stephan Ara@@ p So@@ i .
he was in possession of the accreditation of the ath@@ lete , who stood on the list for the training controls of the World Anti @-@ Dop@@ ing Agency .
F@@ erg@@ us@@ on Rot@@ ich became more than 800 metres in Beijing in 2015 .
four days earlier , the Ken@@ yan athle@@ tics delegation leader Michael Rot@@ er had been deduc@@ ted from the Rio games .
he is said to have informed athletes of his country about pending dop@@ ing tests .
according to media reports , he was said to have been arrested at his return to Nairobi &apos;s airport .
in Kenya , the IO@@ C has been monitoring many dop@@ ing contracts for some time under special observation .
at the announcement of the more than 2000 dop@@ ing target controls submitted by the IO@@ C before the Rio games , unusual attention was drawn to the fact that athletes from Kenya and Russia were targeted .
the world anti @-@ dop@@ ing agency had put a lot of pressure on the African country before the summer games in Brazil to create an anti @-@ dop@@ ing law and a functioning control system .
the law was passed a few weeks before the Olympics .
as a result , the WA@@ DA Kenya accepted from the list of countries whose dop@@ ing control is compliant with the rules of WA@@ DA .
Kenya is considered a big runner @-@ nation .
the athletes of the country won the most med@@ als at the 2015 World Cup in Beijing .
in a series of TV reports of the ARD , alleg@@ ations were made that in Kenya dop@@ ing means are easily accessible and there should be a considerable ment@@ ality of sports bet@@ ting .
IO@@ C member Richard Po@@ und asked for a similar investigation in Kenya as he had employed in Russian athle@@ tics .
it has been proven that this type of sport has been comprehen@@ sively and systematically sub@@ du@@ ed .
ther@@ eu@@ pon , Russia &apos;s athletes were excluded from the summer games .
&quot; West Side Story &quot; with Ceci@@ lia Bart@@ oli
in the Shakespeare @-@ year , the Salzburg Festival presents the &quot; West Side Story &quot; with Tony and Maria as a tragic romantic couple , similar to Romeo and Juli@@ et .
with it a surprising Ceci@@ lia Bart@@ oli .
a musical conqu@@ ers Salzburg : the West Side Story , &quot; Le@@ orn@@ ard Bernstein &apos;s masterpiece .
the artistic director Ceci@@ lia Bart@@ oli wanted to bring the musical into the temple of classical music and filled himself with the role of Mary a youth dream .
in the orchestra pit the Sim@@ ón Bol@@ í@@ var Orchestra under the direction of the Venezu@@ el@@ an conductor Gu@@ st@@ av@@ o Du@@ dam@@ el : &quot; this music is full of rhythm , &quot; he he@@ ats .
we always say that it is very Latin American .
there are many Latin American ingredients in their tempo and their melody .
it &apos;s a wonderful mixture , the perfect recipe for our orchestra .
I would say that we really have Bern@@ st@@ eins music in our blood !
in this st@@ aging , Bart@@ oli plays an older Maria .
she re@@ members her love with Tony while the younger Maria is playing and dancing .
the role of Mary has always fascinated me .
first of all because it is musi@@ cally unusual !
and then there would be Mary &apos;s personality .
she says it in her song : &quot; I feel pretty , oh so pretty , I feel pretty and wit@@ ty and bright . &quot;
so it is clever , of course also na@@ ï@@ ve , and very passion@@ ately .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she is very similar to me , my Italian character I &apos;m a Roman , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; laughs Bart@@ oli . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Du@@ dam@@ el is full of praise for the opera singer : &quot; Ceci@@ lia is a wonderful artist . &quot;
it is such an honour to work with her .
it is a mon@@ strous generous human being .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and Bart@@ oli returns the compli@@ ment : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Du@@ dam@@ el is such an extraordinary artist and very passionate ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
conducting is a necessity for him .
you see it in each of his movements , in his eyes , it &apos;s his life !
it is such a huge opportunity to share this musical experience with him .
we both have a rather southern temper@@ ament , a fire , a passion and also a happy approach to life , which is very important at all !
for the American director Philip W@@ m . Mc@@ Kin@@ ley is the &quot; West Side Story &quot; up @-@ to @-@ date : &quot; this piece deals with prejudi@@ ce and fan@@ ati@@ cism . &quot;
today we have the refugees , at that time the Pu@@ ert@@ ori@@ ans went to New York , and the New York residents did not want them .
they are the same themes , and they are as meaningful today as they were then .
59 years later , the piece is still relevant .
London school girl , who joined the IS , was killed in Syria
K@@ adi@@ za Sult@@ ana , one of three British school@@ girls who left London last year to join the IS , re@@ port@@ edly died in Syria .
the lawyer Tas@@ ni@@ me A@@ kun@@ je@@ e said that a few weeks ago her family learned about her death in Ra@@ q@@ q@@ a , Syria .
it was thought that she was killed by a Russian air raid in Ra@@ q@@ q@@ a , the Boll@@ werk of the group in the country , I@@ TV News reported on Thursday .
Sult@@ ana was sev@@ ent@@ een years old and , according to her family , died shortly after she had prepared to leave the war @-@ torn country and return to England .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we can only hope that the only good therein lies - as reminder and warning to others that these are the risks associated with going into a war zone - to stop people to ever make this decision , &quot; said A@@ kun@@ je@@ e .
in February 2015 , Sult@@ ana and two other school@@ girls from the east of London climbed into a plane to Turkey and then entering a bus to the Syrian border .
Sul@@ tan@@ as &apos;s family was told that she had married an IS@@ IS fighter in Syria - and became a widow within a few months .
Rei@@ d says Clinton will stay at Gar@@ land as candidates for the Supreme Court in case of election victory
Harry Rei@@ d , Leader of the Democrats in the Senate , is convinced that the Democratic candidate of the Democrats , H@@ illary Clinton , will nom@@ inate the judge Mer@@ ri@@ ck Gar@@ land for the Supreme Court .
Republi@@ cans in the Senate have blocked Gary &apos;s confirmation since his nom@@ ination by Barack Obama in March .
the majority leader in the Senate Mit@@ ch Mc@@ Conn@@ ell believes that the next President will appoint the successor of the late Ju@@ dge at the Supreme Court Anton@@ in Sc@@ alia .
Rei@@ d said on Thursday during a telephone conference that Clinton expects Gar@@ land to &quot; choose &quot; with a certain degree of certainty .
a spokes@@ woman of Rei@@ d later said that he had not talked to Clinton if she would nom@@ inate Gar@@ land and he spec@@ ulated .
he praised Gar@@ land and said Clin@@ tons &apos;s team would not worry about rest@@ lessness with a new candidate .
Gar@@ land is the Supreme Court for the US Court of App@@ eals for the District of Columbia .
RAID said Republi@@ cans were blocking Scotland &apos;s nom@@ ination , be lack@@ eys and hel@@ pers of the Republi@@ can presidential candidate Donald Tr@@ ump .
he also stated that Donald Tr@@ ump is un@@ suitable for the pres@@ idency .
Tre@@ ats wants to have nude calendar for &quot; women and for men &quot;
the Tre@@ ats magazine co@@ operates with photographer David Bell@@ em@@ ere to release a 1970 @-@ year Pir@@ elli @-@ inspired calendar for 2017 .
but instead of famous naked people , they would like to find the next generation of super@@ models for their N@@ U M@@ uses Calendar for 2017 .
the editor @-@ in @-@ chief of Tre@@ ats Steve Sha@@ w told us at the beginning of this year that his n@@ ak@@ edness magazine is distingu@@ ish@@ able from classic school play@@ boys , since Play@@ boy is for men . &quot;
I do this for women .
apparently he &apos;s the view that it also does the calendar .
&quot; we have to return to the representation of timeless and classic nu@@ dity , in which both women and men feel well and feel inspired by these images of a female body , &quot; said Sha@@ w in a press release about the release of the calendar .
women will want to participate in this project because it is a beautiful work of art .
models can submit their pictures online or in person at an open casting call in Los Angeles and New York .
Turkey : Kur@@ dish congregation reck@@ ons with mass flight
&quot; anyone who doesn &apos;t adapt and praise Erdo@@ gan is sitting on packed suit@@ cases , &quot; says the president of the Gü@@ len @-@ near Foundation Di@@ alogue and World , Er@@ can Kar@@ ak@@ oy@@ un .
in the short term , the Kur@@ dish congregation of Germany pays off with tens of thousands of refugees fle@@ eing from Turkey to Germany .
in the medium term , it could even be &quot; a few hundred thousand , &quot; believes Ali Top@@ ra@@ k , the chairman of the association .
following the attempted coup attempt by Turkish President Rec@@ ep Tay@@ y@@ ip Erdo@@ gan after the attempted coup , the Kur@@ dish congregation of Germany anticip@@ ates a mass flight to Germany .
&quot; in the short term , I reck@@ on with tens of thousands , in the medium term with several hundred thousand refugees from Turkey in Germany , when the Erdo@@ gan regime continues to fight the minorities and the democratic opposition , &quot; says the President Ali Top@@ ra@@ k of the &quot; World &quot; on Friday .
because the government had already beaten up Kur@@ dish stron@@ gh@@ olds before months , 500@@ ,000 Kur@@ ds were fle@@ eing within Turkey .
after the vain coup , secular and op@@ posi@@ tional ethnic Turks came to the fore .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many will want to restart in Europe if they are further supp@@ ressed in Turkey . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it cannot be that a state that takes refugees even refugees in their own country &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Top@@ ra@@ k . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the chairman of the Association accused the deliber@@ ate settlement of Syrian Arabs in Kur@@ dish , but also in the Latvian cities .
Erdo@@ gan was aiming to raise the outlet pressure on the remaining Kur@@ ds .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they are the last great minority in Turkey , the Christian Armen@@ ians and Greeks have been exter@@ min@@ ated or displaced in the past hundred years , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Top@@ ra@@ k , who is also a CD@@ U member . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the president demanded that the federal government &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as sharp as Austria is positioned against Erdo@@ gan and his followers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in Germany too , a &quot; witch hunt &quot; takes place against Erdo@@ gan critics .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in recent months , I feel no longer safe in Germany for the first time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the German branch of the Gü@@ len movement also fears the fle@@ eing of many Turks abroad .
more Turks will seek asylum in Germany , especially Kur@@ ds and Op@@ position@@ ists .
the brand mark as Gü@@ len follow@@ er destro@@ ys teachers and other ac@@ adem@@ ics the professional existence .
&quot; whoever does not suit and praise Erdo@@ gan is sitting on packed suit@@ cases , inci@@ dentally also the K@@ em@@ alists and sec@@ ul@@ ars , &quot; said Er@@ can Kar@@ ak@@ oy@@ un , president of the Gü@@ len @-@ near Foundation Di@@ alogue and Education , the &quot; World . &quot;
as the newspaper reports on appeal to the figures of the Federal Ministry of the Interior , the Turks already presented the largest group of the eligible voters who were eligible for political persecution in Germany before the coup .
as of June 30 , this would have been 11,@@ 3@@ 86 people , and thus nearly 29 percent of all recognised as eligible for asylum ( 3@@ 9.@@ 6@@ 25 ) .
in this survey they do not find themselves worthy of war , poverty or lack of perspective .
asylum seek@@ ers according to the Basic Law are exclusively political , i.e. , from the state side , individually persecuted .
Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern : &quot; go where it hur@@ ts &quot;
strange Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern : the locals don &apos;t get anything from the summer election campaign - and the holiday makers from North Rhine @-@ Westphalia are not allowed to choose the country &apos;s day .
they understood in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern .
2021 will not be held directly at the end of the summer holidays , the Schwer@@ in parliament has already decided at the beginning of the year .
because it &apos;s not stupid as to date : summer holidays , heat and a summer bal@@ m fight - this is bit@@ ing .
the locals , who are to be convinced by the election fighters , are on holiday .
most of the vac@@ ation@@ ers in the country on the way to Use@@ dom , Ru@@ egen or Hid@@ den@@ see are no natives , so are not allowed to choose the country &apos;s day .
there are practical problems : the holidays are hel@@ pers who hang posters , infl@@ ate ballo@@ ons , distribute fl@@ yers and en@@ umer@@ ate voices in the end , just drive out troubles@@ ome .
until 4 September 2016 , the election and the last day of the holiday , Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern has to pass an election campaign close to the people .
the hot phase , if you can say it at all , has just begun .
and it &apos;s about something : Prime Minister Er@@ win Sell@@ ering , leader of an SPD / CD@@ U coalition , must fear his ministry .
the SPD , the strongest party since 1998 , is now clearly behind the CD@@ U in surveys .
exciting is how strongly newcom@@ er Af@@ D cuts off and what remains at the end of co@@ ali@@ tions .
cel@@ ery , 66 years old and head of government since 2008 , makes an almost in@@ con@@ spic@@ uous campaign , one can see from his big posters .
he travels across the country , distri@@ butes ro@@ ses and chat@@ ting a bit with the people , just like his legendary elo@@ qu@@ ent predecessor , Harald Ring@@ storff also did .
otherwise , Seel@@ ering has got cold feet and gives Chancellor Merkel the blame for the blo@@ oming of the Af@@ D .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; their refugee policy , their &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; We create this &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; acceler@@ ates the rise of the right @-@ wing pop@@ uli@@ sts , which will probably cost him the nice office . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the CD@@ U with its top channel candidates , the Interior Minister Lor@@ enz C@@ aff@@ ier , has already experienced how it is when you make electoral campaigns at the right time at the wrong time .
she has invited Chancellor Angela Merkel to large @-@ format demonstrations twice ; Merkel &apos;s federal election district is located in the north @-@ east .
but the target group did not agree , there were more Nordrhein @-@ Westfalen , Berliner and Sax@@ onia as Mecklenburg and Vorpommern .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there was probably the majority from other states , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Vincent Kok@@ ert , Secretary General of the CD@@ U in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern , recently in N@@ DR . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but it &apos;s too bad for anyone from other corners of Germany to listen to Angela Merkel once .
otherwise , the Nor@@ theast CD@@ U largely disp@@ enses with the usual election campaigns at market places and in front of shopping m@@ alls with umbrellas and ballo@@ ons .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Kok@@ ert , plays only a &quot; subordin@@ ate role &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
also the Union has noticed that in the country you leave the base , that it needs to be very strict , to find again a wire to the people .
you are on the left , the SPD , the Gre@@ ens : there is hardly any present in the vast expan@@ ses of the country .
the Council of the CD@@ U election fighter Kok@@ ert on his fellow comb@@ at@@ ants is , however , self @-@ revealing : &quot; you have to go where it hur@@ ts , namely , where people are : Dor@@ othe@@ este , golden weddings , every birthday party must be used . &quot;
because much is on the game , Sell@@ ering has now called its SPD to an especially committed campaign .
in surveys , the Socialists and Democrats were at least 22 per cent behind partner CD@@ U ( 25 ) and just ahead of the Af@@ D ( 19 ) .
at the 2011 election , the SPD won still 3@@ 5.@@ 6 percent ahead of the CD@@ U ( 22 ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Gre@@ ens , small party with seven percent in poll@@ s , are likely to make the leap into the rural life . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they make a modern virtue out of the need for a holiday and largely transfer their election campaign into the internet .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; online election campaign , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the president of the country Claudia Müller . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
otherwise , green bal@@ lot fighters go on search for local voters among the vac@@ ation@@ ers .
Sil@@ ke Ga@@ je@@ k , the top candidate , cur@@ v@@ ates straight with a hous@@ ebo@@ at through the Mecklenburg Lake and finds it even beautiful .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; their impression : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; election holidays in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern is not a punishment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
B@@ 27 @-@ Ren@@ ov@@ ation : restaurants suffer from block@@ age
at the speed with which the B 27 is rehabil@@ itated , there is nothing to complain about .
for those responsible for the construction work starting at 5.@@ 30 a.m. and ending at 8@@ pm , there are all praise .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they did everything quite jag@@ ged , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says El@@ vi@@ ra T@@ etz@@ l@@ aff from the jet fuel station . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is a super@@ team .
there is no delay .
the construction site could be moved to the south according to schedule at the beginning of the week , until the end of October everything will be finished .
the opposite of those responsible for the construction work is also commen@@ ded , for example when it comes to the establishment of expe@@ ditions .
since the construction site was mig@@ rated to the south on Monday and also the block@@ age of the asphalt road in O@@ fter@@ d@@ ingen was lifted and the connection to Rot@@ tenburg again exists , the traffic situation within the town has eased .
the citizens can now drive from O@@ fter@@ d@@ ingen on both sides of the B 27 .
the pass traffic through the place seems to go back .
&quot; there were some considerable complaints , &quot; says the Deputy Chief Executive Officer Florian King , responsible for the transport management of the refur@@ bish@@ ment .
the residents of Bach@@ ar@@ straße , Stein@@ la@@ ch@@ strasse , Haf@@ ner@@ straße and Wei@@ her@@ rain had to fight with more traffic noise because many cre@@ eping routes were looking and more familiar with their navigation system than the sign@@ posting .
what led to the fact that some trucks were fran@@ king in residential areas .
since the speed limits were not met , the municipality also called for M@@ ös@@ singen .
&quot; there were significant transgres@@ sions , &quot; says King , who made himself aware of the situation on the spot .
two to three per minute have been bre@@ w@@ ed .
the fastest was on the way at 77 km / h in the Tempo @-@ 30 zone .
since the construction site has been moved on , it has become qui@@ eter .
for the business people on the B 27 it is only a small con@@ sol@@ ation that the road is now open for customers from Rot@@ tenburg .
business@@ men do not like to look into the cards .
but the fact that the B@@ 27 @-@ refur@@ bish@@ ment has led to a fall in sales leads everyone to look through .
however , some are more and some less affected .
those who have less to do with the &quot; end customer &quot; are thus produced for other companies , for whom the refur@@ bish@@ ment has hardly any consequences .
Thomas Sul@@ z also talks about a &quot; maximum slight decline &quot; at the deal@@ er@@ ship in Ma@@ ier , but also ad@@ mits that &quot; the race is missing naturally . &quot;
the most heavily traffi@@ cked are the local along the road .
J. Albert G@@ öh@@ ner , owner of Ste@@ ak@@ house , formerly crown , finds clear words .
this is exist@@ ential threat .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not only him , but all the restaurants &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hit hard &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the customers were missing from H@@ ech@@ ingen , Bal@@ ingen and Rot@@ t@@ weil .
we must be happy about every euro turnover .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he cited the sales losses in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; far above 50 percent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; road marking took its operation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for two years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
half of his co @-@ workers have to be released .
if I had a company with 4000 employees and half had been dismissed , the policy would have re@@ acted differently .
instead , President Jörg Schmidt has made a request from G@@ öh@@ ner if there could be a financial compensation with the hint that the restaurant would otherwise benefit from the advantages of the location on the B 27 .
G@@ öh@@ ner knows from other coun@@ ties , where something more generous has been handled .
in all the complaints , G@@ öh@@ ner is sure that his restaurant will continue to exist .
after all , family business has been settled here since 17@@ 15 , pointing to the long history .
he can understand that other regular passengers are now less frequent due to complicated traffic management .
if you can &apos;t get there , it is also somewhere else beautiful .
G@@ öh@@ ner has no doubt that his regular client@@ ele comes back to the end of the renovation work .
despite the crisis of BSE and avian influ@@ enza , G@@ öh@@ ner considers the impact of the B 27 construction works on his client@@ ele for the greatest crisis that its restaurant has experienced in its long @-@ standing history .
six months of construction work , which is brutal .
in the name of the fight against terrorism , laws are being bol@@ ted to laws .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the recent attacks , Interior Minister de Ma@@ izi@@ ère now presents a thick security package . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but what has a duty to do with terror ?
and what does the coalition partner say about all this ?
Thomas de Ma@@ izi@@ ère gives the satisfaction .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all his proposals are &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; politically reasonable , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says the Federal Minister of the Interior in presenting his new security package . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they don &apos;t overwhel@@ m anyone .
others , further points would first be discussed within the parties .
I also took part in this .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but as the Minister of the Interior he is located on the results and at a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; real@@ is@@ able consensus &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; within the Coalition . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the recent attacks in Würzburg and Ans@@ bach , de Ma@@ izi@@ ère has given a little time to pass before he presents his conclusions for security in the Republic .
but now they are all the more extensive .
some things have already been announced , announced , stated , that a new security agency should take care of the cra@@ cking of encrypted communication is not new .
it is also not the fact that Germany has to implement several EU directives on passenger data and arms legislation .
the call for more video surveillance and personnel for security authorities is also not surprising .
in part , de Ma@@ izi@@ ère starts a second run for proposals which have not been made with the SPD so far : he wants to put sympathy for terrorist groups under penalty and kno@@ ck jihadi@@ sts with dual citizenship to the German passport .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this will be difficult points for the SPD , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; cle@@ ars the CD@@ U man . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he nevertheless believes this to be reasonable and also demands nothing , which in the co@@ ali@@ tional partner has no chance anyway .
a few new ideas also present de Ma@@ izi@@ ère .
they are in part in themselves : he plans quick processes for deport@@ ations and more possibilities to incar@@ cer@@ ate people before deport@@ ation .
refugees who are targeted in the country should check their smartphones first and open social media accounts for a security check .
in the case of suspi@@ ci@@ ons for rejected asylum seek@@ ers , he wants to make some even worse than to date - such as comm@@ itting crimes or deliberately throwing away their papers to disgu@@ ise their identity .
some of these are political and legal .
many things also seem to have been disp@@ le@@ ased and open questions openly .
and at some points - in the im@@ patient treatment of patient - for example - the question arises : what does that have to do with security and terror ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yes , says de Ma@@ izi@@ ère , it is important to differenti@@ ate between the topics refugees and terror . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but it can &apos;t be said that the residents of Ans@@ bach and Würzburg were refugees .
in addition , many people were worried about security in the face of the high number of refugees .
and things that people had deeply devoted themselves could not be excluded even in election times .
inner security has shifted enormously into the focus .
first the attacks in the neighborhood : Paris , Copenhagen , Brussels , Nice .
then the attacks in Würzburg and Ans@@ bach .
the uncertainty is great .
and yes , elections are available .
the Union and the SPD are therefore increasingly in position in the issue of internal security .
in the past few days , the two parties went up high .
only an armed dispute over the equipment of the Federal Police , then on a security policy collection of some Uni@@ ons interior ministers , in which the chiefs also demand a bur@@ ka ban and a departure from the dual citizenship .
de Ma@@ izi@@ ère also struggles here for conci@@ li@@ atory sounds .
he does not think of a departure from the double pass .
we satisfied the discussion in Germany .
to re@@ open it is not sensible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and with a bur@@ ka ban he has constitutional concerns . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
whether its own package at all corners is constitutional and whether it is actually &quot; reasonable &quot; for the coalition partner has yet to show itself .
there is a lot of things that could cause conflict .
but the SPD is currently attempting to pro@@ long itself on the subject of internal security .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the SPD is ready to talk about everything that helps to further increase security . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
even Volkswagen is gli@@ mm@@ ing through .
despite diesel sc@@ and@@ als , delivery volumes increase worldwide .
but it does not run smoothly in all markets .
in the recall action there are vor@@ tices around a term .
Volkswagen starts its deliveries in the second half of the year .
in spite of its many brands and some well @-@ running markets , Europe &apos;s largest car manufacturer can continue to show a plus in the course of the course of the year .
however , in July , the Volkswagen nuclear brand slow@@ ed mainly in Western Europe and therefore res@@ ig@@ ned the total sales , as reported by the company in D@@ ax .
in July , the VW brand sold in July with 44@@ 9@@ 100 cars 1.8 percent less vehicles than in the previous year &apos;s month .
in Western Europe alone , the second most important market in China , sales were 14 percent below the previous year &apos;s level .
in Germany &apos;s home market , deliveries declined by almost one sixth .
brand sales Jürgen St@@ ack@@ mann brought back the weaker figures from July , above all to two sales days less in Europe .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , in some core markets , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; changed economic framework &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has given a reluc@@ tance to buy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition to the situation around the coup attempt in Turkey , also the British vote on leaving the EU stressed , a spokes@@ woman explained .
in the USA , where the exhaust @-@ sc@@ andal has escal@@ ated first , a minus is also on the horizon .
great support for VW is the Chinese market .
all in all , the primarily affected home brand of Lower Saxony is continuing to gli@@ de through the diesel sc@@ andal : after the first seven months , only a distribution minus of 0.@@ 9 percent to 3.@@ 37 million vehicles is available .
from January to July , sales of Group sales Fred Kap@@ pler continued to demonstrate a sales pl@@ aza .
Volkswagen delivered 1.3 percent more vehicles at this time , 5,@@ 9@@ 04 million worldwide .
Volkswagen had manipul@@ ated exhaust tests with a software .
in Germany alone , VW calls around 2.5 million vehicles to retro@@ fit the workshops .
in the course of the conversion VW re@@ affir@@ med that the conversion of cars did not have any negative effects .
after upgrading the vehicles , there is no deterioration in fuel consumption , CO2 emissions or engine power .
after the conversion , the car manufacturer delivered a &quot; guaranteed &quot; certificate , but I do not speak of a &quot; guarantee &quot; as was the case on Friday in business trips .
reason to be legal intri@@ c@@ acies .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Focus &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; had reported that Volkswagen now grants its German customers a guarantee for converted diesel models . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this would have confirmed VW representatives in the Federal Ministry of Transport last Monday .
from the Ministry of Transport it was confirmed that there was this meeting .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; VW has fulfilled the requirements of my investigation commission and the KBA . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; deviations from this are not accepted , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; declared Minister of Transport Alexander Do@@ brin@@ dt ( CS@@ U ) according to the ministry . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
VW has assumed that fuel consumption , CO2 emissions and engine power do not take place after retro@@ fitting , and all type @-@ approved vehicle values remain unchanged .
Volkswagen does not use the term &quot; guarantee &quot; but not as it was meant in business trips .
with the wide term &quot; guarantee &quot; Volkswagen has the possibility that for example , for example , half a year after the conversion , customers might get into a workshop with a motor failure - and this could lead to the new software , even if the damage has nothing to do with it .
even in customer interest , it is important to avoid that in case of any other damage that has nothing to do with the sc@@ andal , there is uncertainty about possible warranty regulations as it was meant .
this is why VW does not use the term &quot; guarantee . &quot;
Rai@@ ff@@ ei@@ sen@@ bank G@@ mund am T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see demands pen@@ alties from rich as@@ par@@ agus in the future - as a second institute in Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bank manager Josef Paul said on Thursday : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is only about 139 clients who park 40 million euros on checking or daily cash accounts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Federal Association of German B@@ anks speaks of an individual case and sees no signal in it : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; normal savers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; must not be afraid of paying for their austerity measures . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; store banks money over night at the European Central Bank ( ECB ) , they have to pay their 0.4 percent penalty . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Rai@@ ff@@ ei@@ sen@@ bank G@@ mund will charge this fee from September of private and corporate customers for deposits of over 100,000 euros to sight deposit account or day @-@ to @-@ day money accounts .
&quot; the first 100,000 euros are free . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the next 100,000 will cost 400 euros in the future , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Paul . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for some time he was jumping 40 million euros , which could be withdrawn from one day to the other and which he could not utilize .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they lie with me on the central bank account and cause 0.4 per cent cost , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Bank CEO . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I can &apos;t lay down for every million Euros . &quot;
after the pol@@ lu@@ ter pays the costs further .
to leave the cash in the v@@ aults of the Rai@@ ff@@ ei@@ sen@@ bank would be too dangerous : &quot; I have already experienced four attacks , I don &apos;t like the fifth ! , &quot; said the Chief Financial Officer .
most customers had understanding and changed to other forms of investment .
only a few mig@@ rated to other banks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Bavarian &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; co @-@ operatives &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; declared : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the ECB &apos;s extreme monetary policy course causes considerable costs in all banks . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to carry it alone , be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; economically not possible permanently . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
some German banks have therefore increased their account management fees , credit cards or bank transfers .
the Thür@@ inger Volks@@ en- und Rai@@ ff@@ ei@@ sen@@ bank Alten@@ burger Land , with its Sk@@ at@@ bank branch in 2014 , made head@@ lines with pen@@ alties for deposits starting from three million euros .
Michael K@@ em@@ mer , head of the banking union , said : &quot; we do not expect private customers to pay nationwide fees for deposits , and the competition in Germany under banks and savings banks is much too strong . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a ban@@ ker said on T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see there is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a client@@ ele , endow@@ ed with wealth a bit more luxuri@@ antly . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this can be a problem for a small bank , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if she &apos;s money for free . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the cooperative bank G@@ mund founded in 1911 has branches in Bad Wies@@ see , Rot@@ t@@ ach @-@ E@@ gern , Kre@@ uth and T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the co @-@ operatives &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bavaria &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; are currently no other banks that charge a compensation set for private customers deposits , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said spokesperson Ernst . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the President of the Bundes@@ verband der deutschen Volks@@ banken and Rai@@ ff@@ ei@@ sen@@ banken ( B@@ VR ) , Uwe Fr@@ öh@@ lich , had declared at the end of June : &quot; the threshold to go into neg@@ atives compared to private customers is very , very high . &quot;
competition is tough , and it threat@@ ens the immigration of investors to competition .
the customers in Germany won &apos;t be able to please that in width .
destination Pl@@ ates : who bu@@ ys records ?
sol@@ itary middle @-@ aged men love plates .
before comm@@ itting to the comment section , under the pseu@@ don@@ ym Non @-@ Alle@@ vi@@ ator Men of the Middle Ages with rough insul@@ ts , this statement deri@@ ves from current data .
according to You@@ Go@@ v , the much discussed re@@ emergence of vinyl records is not attributable to a boom in mill@@ enni@@ als , which want to welcome the news of physical objects , but to Mid@@ life @-@ Nost@@ al@@ gia .
those who recently purchased a plate are all for@@ esi@@ ght for@@ wards between 45 and 54 .
in fact , the age group of 18 @-@ 24 is the most unlikely killing group .
it is also not a hor@@ des by hobby collectors - it has an emotional meaning : older record buyers prefer to retain their feelings for themselves ( 56 % vs. 53 % ) and enjoy spending time alone ( 69 % vs 66 % ) .
but do the results of You@@ Go@@ v match ?
if this blog is a news report on TV , the camera would follow me while I run in the midst of a busy street in Soh@@ o , wearing a modest gray suit and stu@@ ffed wild before I stand , hold my hands and say something better : &quot; so , let &apos;s take a closer look at it . &quot;
so let &apos;s take a look at it .
even if the heart of Soh@@ o is slowly losing its charm - Hotels , restaurants and offices now fill the buildings in which once independent sellers were located - there is still a handful of fantastic plate specialist shops .
I would probably ask the cam@@ er@@ aman to switch off the camera for the next part in which I stand in close proximity to various men in such stores and try to assess their age and minds through observation .
Stu@@ art from Glasgow , 55 , which I of Si@@ ster Ray ( number of data : two young women , three middle aged men ) to Rec@@ kl@@ ess Records ( Number of records : eight middle @-@ aged men , a woman , probably around the 20 ) , is one day long because of a meeting in London and goes through the shops to fill the couple of hours .
is he a collector , I ask ?
&quot; I guess already , &quot; he says .
I have about 3.000 or 4.000 plates .
these records , shown above ( he sent me the snapshot by e @-@ mail , I didn &apos;t follow him at home ) , dress up the walls of his living room .
the reason why he has such a vast number of albums and sing@@ les is the result of his disposable income : he is now able to buy records he could not afford to buy and to buy items that he sold when he was young and pl@@ agu@@ ed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many things I buy are from the late 60s , early 70s , which appeared when I was 11 or 12 . things in which I was probably something too young to buy them , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he agrees that those who buy records are rather intro@@ ver@@ ted and like to spend time alone , adding : &quot; I don &apos;t smoke and I don &apos;t drink much .
this is my vice .
WE@@ Z , 25 , who works with Si@@ ster Ray , also believes that many customers he meets You@@ Go@@ v profile .
however , he has also noticed a new wave of people who are influenced by the media pupp@@ y , people who have heard about com@@ eback and get to buy their old records .
from the conversations I have led , people usually get rid of their collection so around 1998 or 1999 .
customers who once sold their records to buy CDs now sell their CDs to buy their records , &quot; he says .
this would explain the boom to trailers of the record pitch of a certain age .
but what about the alleged emotional meaning of records ?
it takes only a few seconds in a shop like Ph@@ onica to realize that record stores offer a soothing community of like @-@ minded people .
according to WE@@ Z , some of the older customers imp@@ acted the cont@@ ac@@ tless payment system .
some plate fans feel overwhel@@ med by the digital world and want to withdraw to the stability of familiar vinyl covers , from objects that are awakening lucky youth memories .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think sometimes it can be the filling of empt@@ iness or possession of material possessions as a kind of comfort , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says WE@@ Z . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is the case with me as a collector and I think it is so with many people .
it is a simple way to mentally engage oneself .
&quot; we are like their social workers ! &quot; an employee fli@@ rts from a record stack .
a survey by IC@@ M in April revealed that almost 50 % of people who bought a record last month have not yet listened .
the survey also found that 41 % have a record player they never use , while 7 % of those who buy a record have no record player .
at this time of the news report I would probably look very worried as I smo@@ other through a pile of Bos@@ sa Nova compil@@ ations .
Jon@@ ny , 42 , who works at Sounds of the Universe ( Number of records : three middle aged men ) has noticed a &quot; tro@@ phy aspect &quot; of the Revi@@ val .
&quot; someone recently came in here and said , &quot; I don &apos;t own a record player , but I would like to buy a Radi@@ oh@@ ead pod , so that I can put it on the shelf , &quot; he says .
this is not a big percentage , but it definitely happens .
more productive , less music @-@ class .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have people who say : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t have a record player . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
these are younger people , not older ones , who only slowly get in .
F@@ opp , which has devoted the sound panels to almost a whole floor , has a b@@ lower audience when I go in .
there are couples around the 70 , tourists who make photos , teen@@ age boys and middle @-@ aged women .
even if the atmosphere is somewhat less relaxed than in the above @-@ mentioned shops - Wild Be@@ ast &apos;s newest syn@@ thesizer and sex@@ t@@ pack@@ et pop instead of experimental jazz sounds from the loudspeakers - it is good to see such a diversity among the customers .
no one of them looks very lonely , but next psych@@ ic trau@@ mas are hard to find when standing next to someone 30 seconds long .
E@@ lan@@ ora , 27 , runs around in the shop for a few minutes and looks at the variety of records available for sale .
it is more of a window @-@ shopping than a wholesale shopping .
it doesn &apos;t deserve much , so collecting records is not a real option , says it .
it costs a lot .
it is easy to hear music from a computer or any other way , but the beauty of records is ... &quot; it drives with a loving si@@ gh .
I don &apos;t know how to explain it - it &apos;s really unique .
my last stop is a business that is said to have inspired a new generation of record lovers : urban out@@ fit@@ ters .
while I appear to be wearing je@@ ans hot pants , I watch a group of young teen@@ age girls who are group@@ ing for a moment around Pol@@ aro@@ id cameras before a father and his daughter are considering buying a cros@@ ley record player .
on the left is a staircase , a wall full of panels of Adel@@ e , Jeff Buck@@ ley , A@@ my Win@@ ehouse and Fle@@ et@@ wood Mac : a mixture of contemporary music and classics , the essential plates for an average collection .
no one looks at them - maybe because they are only purely decorative , some so far up that it is impossible to touch them .
it is pure &quot; plate art . &quot;
but considering that any attraction for these items imp@@ ly more money for the industry and some customers could send to the depths of Soh@@ o for more , there is nothing to complain about .
it is no surprise that a population group , which has more time and money than others , is also the one that is most suitable for luxury items such as records .
even if my research showed that the results of You@@ Go@@ v are right , they , at least in record stores in Soh@@ o , let the large number of female collectors exist , who exist in the reality , record stores and online forums .
these people are probably working hard at school or in offices .
they spend their Thursday mor@@ nings with security not by bit@@ ing the tops of Ber@@ wick Street and the sheets through sheets while they ste@@ er clear of an unc@@ anny , 30 @-@ year @-@ old fake moder@@ ator , who raises nothing of middle @-@ aged men over the shoulders .

French court re@@ jects offer on demoli@@ tion of shops in the jungle refugee camp
a French court rejected a quote from the authorities in Cal@@ ais , dozens of temporary shops and restaurants in the jungle of Cal@@ ais , where thousands of refugees live .
during a court hearing this week , the authorities in Cal@@ ais argued that the state should be authorised to sell 72 temporary shops in which individuals within the camp sell goods , cigar@@ ettes to energy drinks , sell hair@@ dressing services , or sell tea for 50 c@@ ents ( 40 p@@ ence ) or simple meals for a few euros in temporary restaurants .
the pre@@ f@@ ecture of Cal@@ ais argued that these places were to be dra@@ gged down because they would represent a parallel economy from which no taxes would be paid and which would have a risk of fire and sickness .
humanitarian groups told the court that the shops and restaurants were important as the free meals offered by the state @-@ assisted union and other groups would not provide enough food for the growing numbers in the camp .
they also suggested that the temporary shops and restaurants would often offer accommodation and free meals for people in need .
a court in L@@ ille decided that there would be no legal basis for expul@@ sion of people who run the 72 temporary businesses , but admitted that the concerns of the pre@@ f@@ ecture of Cal@@ ais were absolutely comprehensible . &quot;
judge Jean @-@ François M@@ oll@@ a said that grocery stores , cafes and restaurants would play a much greater role than to feed only people living in extremely prec@@ arious conditions . &quot;
he said that the areas offer quiet meeting points between refugees and volunteers .
one of the places that was threatened by the t@@ ear@@ ing was the Jung@@ le Book Kids &apos; café of the camp , which is operated in a community and offers 200 meals a day , English and French classes as well as advice on asylum cases for the hundreds of vulnerable , un@@ accompanied min@@ ors in the camp .
more than 17@@ 0,000 people signed the petition to preserve the Kids &apos; Café .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a letter to the Guardian , it meant that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the closure &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for these children would be a catastrophe , of which the youngest eight years are old . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the two aid organizations Help Refu@@ ge@@ es and L &apos;@@ Au@@ berge des Mig@@ rants estimated on Friday that the number of living in the jungle camp has risen to more than 9@@ ,000 people - the highest number to now - after a steep increase in new arri@@ vals during the summer .

here comes the En@@ forcement Tra@@ iler
Germany &apos;s rac@@ er must adapt to the next generation speed@@ ometer : in different federal states , among others in H@@ esse and Brandenburg , new flas@@ hes are being tested which will effectively transfer tem@@ pos@@ als .
the futur@@ istic En@@ forcement Tra@@ iler from Vit@@ ronic from Wiesbaden , for example , can be used at accident areas where it would be too dangerous for a mobile measurement by the police .
for example , on motorway construction sites or to sandy bridges with temporary speed poli@@ sh@@ es there is often no necessary infrastructure to ensure that there is a stationary bl@@ itz to ensure compliance with the speed limit .
however , a permanent mobile construction can be too dangerous or complex .
the En@@ forcement Tra@@ iler is self @-@ sufficient : its battery lasts five days with un@@ interrupted measurement operation , the case data is transmitted encrypted via a modem .
laser measurement technology can also detect all vehicles across multiple tracks simultaneously .
variable speed limits as well as drive @-@ through b@@ ans by time , travel strips and vehicle class can also be monitored .
according to the manufacturer , the trailer can be moved by car with trailer hit@@ ch .
so that it is not simply st@@ owed , it is lowered in the measuring mode , so that the wheels disappear in the arm@@ oured and by the way also a fire@@ proof outer cover .
in addition , a built @-@ in alarm system is intended to protect the cameras from v@@ and@@ alism .
since 2015 , the trailer has been tested by Vit@@ ronic in various federal states and is now also used .
even foreign authorities flash with the new technology : recently , France has ordered 100 copies , after an order of 150 pieces last year .
Britain fet@@ ches silver in 7 @-@ year Ru@@ g@@ by after Fi@@ ji Master@@ class reco@@ vers gold
Britain &apos;s impressive performance at 7 @-@ 7 rug@@ by came to an ab@@ rupt halt in the finale on Thursday evening in the form of Fi@@ j@@ is when they were hit here in Rio with a result of 43 @-@ 7 at the final stage .
Fi@@ ji raised a master class in handling , side @-@ stepping , back , line and raw power to gain gold - their first Olympic medal of any colour .
the defeat was defeated by the not too bad silver medal - Britain &apos;s fourth on that day - and they could be proud of their efforts in this tournament in which they beat New Zealand , Argentina and South Africa .
the clear defeat of the Bo@@ ks , 7 @-@ 5 in the semi@@ fin@@ als the same day could fall back to them in the final .
but apart from that , Fi@@ ji might have beaten a 15 @-@ man @-@ team in this form .
it could be a con@@ sol@@ ation for GB - but probably it won &apos;t - that at least a Brit@@ on tomorrow will hang a gold medal around his neck : Fi@@ j@@ is boss coach Ben Ry@@ an , former boss for England from Wim@@ ble@@ don .
GB had a difficult path .
eight years ago , Ry@@ an lost every game with the Adel@@ ai@@ de Sev@@ ens .
here they lost only one .
this hat@@ ch will hurt , but progress is amazing .
Fi@@ ji started wondering and let the attacks bring G@@ Bs out of fun .
it felt for Captain Tom Mit@@ ch@@ ell and Co. as if they were running in running buses . the World Series winners went 5 @-@ 0 upwards , as O@@ sea Kol@@ in@@ is@@ au fro@@ sted in the corner .
with four minutes of playing , Jer@@ ry Tu@@ wa@@ i added another attack from the right @-@ hand corner .
12 @-@ 0 and GB hardly touched the ball .
a T@@ ackle T@@ ackle from Mit@@ ch@@ ell stopped the mountain of man Leone N@@ ak@@ ar@@ awa open a third gate , but Fi@@ ji only stopped .
in the seventh minute Ath@@ ena Ver@@ em@@ al@@ ua found a touch @-@ down in the right corner and it was 0 @-@ 17 for GB .
N@@ ak@@ ar@@ awa added a new member since the re@@ union and there was still a minute of playing ... in the first half .
V@@ atem@@ o Rav@@ ou@@ vo@@ u pres@@ sured by further weak Tac@@ kl@@ ings of the GB team and stor@@ med up to the line to make a gate .
the conversion brought a 29 @-@ 0 to a break .
it is like Fi@@ ji was born to play 7 , while GB is still learning .
this is how it is .
GB introduced fundamental changes to half @-@ time and closed the fi@@ ji@@ an gap ... for a total of four minutes , which was good for the conditions of the first half @-@ time until Joshua went through Tu@@ is@@ ova after a brilliant intermediate play of Fi@@ ji .
Dan Nor@@ ton launched an attempt for GB , made a touch @-@ down in the left corner for a 36 @-@ 7 , but the game went for a long time in favour of the South Sea sul@@ phi@@ de , whose fans sang , wave flags and d@@ anced on the tri@@ b@@ une .
it was not difficult to admire the playful approach Fi@@ j@@ is .
Mat@@ a V@@ ili@@ ame put the icing on the cake with another attempt in the last few seconds .
the whi@@ ff was crow@@ ned , the Fi@@ j@@ is hu@@ gged and the Great Britain ki@@ cked in the law@@ ns .
earlier on the day Fi@@ ji had defeated Japan in semi @-@ fin@@ als with 20 @-@ 5 and Britain pressed South Africa in a tight half @-@ fin@@ al@@ match from the race - Great Britain &apos;s conversion of the difference .
K@@ yle Brown introduced the Bo@@ ks in the first half to the front , but Dan Nor@@ ton left the line with an impressive foot@@ work and scored a gate among the posts in the second half .
a brilliant late Tac@@ kl@@ ing by Marcus Wat@@ son , the brother of Anthony of the English 15 @-@ A@@ side Team , secured winning - and thus the silver medal .
Hel@@ en Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning inspired by the fight with the trainer &apos;s cancer
there will be no more em@@ otic gold than with these games , and that will mean what is to be called .
from the first stroke to the last 220 hard H@@ ieve , which enter the story , Hel@@ en Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning found an additional meaning in their golden moment at the Est@@ acio da Lag@@ oa .
even if there were only those who were sitting at the helm , there were three voices in the boat . the echo of the trainer Robin Williams , was omni@@ present when they row@@ ed to the second Olympi@@ ag@@ old in the second without a tax @-@ woman , the first women in the history of British sports who put on such a scale .
her domin@@ ance was absolute , after all her 3@@ 9.@@ th un@@ ru@@ ined bet , which is also un@@ parall@@ eled .
what we see are two brilliant ath@@ let@@ ins floating over the surface with the elegance of sw@@ ans , which does not reflect the type of trium@@ ph@@ al go@@ ose .
behind every gold in the rowing , there is a batt@@ ali@@ on of willing hel@@ pers who contribute to incre@@ mental advances that make the difference and no one was more helpful than the coach who did not know whether he would survive this day at all when he was diagnosed with cancer .
as he said , he ris@@ ked .
I had bladder cancer that is oper@@ able and that they did .
if you do not , it spreads everywhere .
it would have been a rather bad situation .
it changes a bit of the outlook .
Williams was diagnosed in December 2013 .
the trio was lucky that he could start treatment at the beginning of 2014 , out of season , which kept the interruption to a minimum , if that was the right term at all under such circumstances .
I needed money , so I had to go better soon .
it was an incentive .
I was in the hospital and ran on the station - 20 feet , 30 feet , 50 feet at a time when they said that some steps would suff@@ ice .
this is how it begins .
rowing itself is a challenge , but that makes it an even greater one .
in the immedi@@ acy of victory , their first thoughts went to Williams , who spent a nerve @-@ raising morning with something more than usual , trying to handle his own fears .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; p@@ anning who was a Captain in the Royal Arti@@ llery Regi@@ ment in a deployment in Afghanistan said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was an emotional wre@@ ck this week . that may be something extreme , but it means so much . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it repe@@ ats just how much I mean , how much I and Hel@@ en and also Robin worked .
there were three fantastic years with Hel@@ en and Robin .
without Robin we would be no one , so a massive thank you goes to him . he is the best coach in the world .
I couldn &apos;t have wished for a better person for training or a better trainer .
Helena Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning have lost no race over the last five years .
the couple had a hard rhythm with which their opponents could not keep up .
even in the last 500 metres , when the teams from New Zealand and Denmark started to stop , St@@ anning and Glo@@ ver had too much in reserve .
we were caught very much at the moment .
Hel@@ en called &quot; stay in the process , stay in the process . &quot;
it is really important not to get carried away .
we had a good start and at the same time we weren &apos;t looking to make something better .
we didn &apos;t want fire@@ works today , we just wanted to get a good result , go out and win the race what we did .
the couple will take a break for one year before making decisions about their future .
Glo@@ ver has to appear next week at a wedding , her own with the TV @-@ advent@@ urer Steve Back@@ shall .
now she just wants to enjoy the moment .
I didn &apos;t want to say that was my last race .
that would have meant too much pressure .
it took about six months in London to understand that I am an Olympic Champion .
it was all so new for me and I was so stressed .
it took about four minutes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this feels so much better , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
exemplary for clarity for 31 years
the managing director of the water expe@@ dient association &quot; V@@ ei@@ ten@@ stein Group , &quot; Rup@@ pert G@@ öl@@ ler , is reti@@ ring .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the association is regarded as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bavarian far exemplary . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a small Fran@@ con@@ ian drinking water @-@ purpose association as a model for large water producers .
some time ago , the original sound was made in a contribution by the Bavarian Radio .
little later , the water forum of the government of Unter@@ fran@@ ken proclaimed the purpose .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the work of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; V@@ ei@@ ten@@ stein &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; group was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bavaria far as exemplary . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
behind all this stands Ru@@ pert G@@ öl@@ ler , who was 31 years in the Con@@ federation of Emplo@@ ye@@ es , 28 of whom served as Managing Director .
now he was retired at the age of 65 .
the drinking water @-@ purpose association of the V@@ ei@@ ten@@ stein group , based in Kot@@ ten@@ dorf , municipality of Breit@@ brun@@ n , promotes annually about 150@@ 000 cubic meters of water and supplies 32 places and ham@@ lets with approximately 5@@ 500 inhabitants .
the municipalities are the commun@@ es of Kirch@@ lou@@ brun@@ n , Breit@@ brun@@ n , Lau@@ ter , E@@ bel@@ s@@ bach and the town of Ba@@ un@@ ach .
there are water supply contracts for other towns and municipalities .
the current chairman , Breit@@ brun@@ n Bürger@@ meister@@ ei Ger@@ tru@@ d Büh@@ l ( F@@ W ) , rec@@ alled that Ru@@ pert G@@ öl@@ ler was appointed a water @-@ keeper in 1985 and was appointed Managing Director of the Zw@@ eck@@ Association in 1988 .
&quot; his duties have been very diverse and they extended from water management and maintenance to office and organizational activities , budget planning , calculation of fees and contributions to emergency interventions at weekends , &quot; said the chairman .
as an outstanding event , she called the start @-@ up and inauguration of the new fountain ( 1994 ) , land purchases in the area of the new fountain ( 1998 ) and compensation of farmers , the reconstruction of the high tanks ( 1999 ) , the re@@ purchase of a central computer control system ( 2004 ) and the partial renewal of water pipes .
there has never been any down@@ time , and there has always been new additions , because water is living and drinking water is the most important food .
in her lau@@ d@@ atio , she praised Gö@@ ll@@ ers loyal , reliable and correct service over 31 years .
he has used a lot of heart blood for his water @-@ purpose association and he regulated the water @-@ purpose association , as if it were his own company .
a few weeks ago , as a real practitioner , he was allowed to present the successful concept of the V@@ ei@@ ten@@ stein Group for nit@@ rate reduction in front of the water forum of the Lower Fran@@ con@@ ia district .
for this he received a lot of praise and praise .
Ru@@ pert G@@ öl@@ ler , on his part , praised Al@@ f@@ ons G@@ rie@@ bel , who worked with him for 28 years .
he is the best water @-@ go@@ er and he was a faithful boy .
together we were an unbe@@ atable team .
as high points from his point of view , he described the well construction and the restructuring of the purpose association .
but the biggest challenge and the most difficult task , however , were the pipe burst at the high container near Kirch@@ ner on a third of January .
here we had to work at minus 17 degrees all night so that the villages could be supplied with water .
also the supply of Neu@@ brun@@ n can only be maintained , because one filled the high can@@ ister of P@@ ett@@ stadt with hoses .
the management of the drinking water utility association was handed over to Daniel Stür@@ mer from Lau@@ ter , who succ@@ eeds Ru@@ pert G@@ öl@@ ler .

relationship at Bar@@ g@@ t@@ eh@@ ei@@ de - man shoots at risk of life
on Friday , a 35 @-@ year @-@ old man shot at 10.@@ 45 in a multi @-@ family house in Bar@@ g@@ t@@ eh@@ ei@@ de ( Stor@@ mar@@ n district ) on his partner and mort@@ ally wounded .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the man himself called and stated to have shot his partner in life , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a police spokes@@ woman . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the perpet@@ r@@ ator is on the run , according to him will be publicly prosec@@ uted .
now nationwide , because Sven S. could be travelling by car .
the man is approximately 1,80 meters tall , muscular , brown burnt and has a bald head .
meanwhile the police have published a photo of him .
however , it is a couple of years old .
meanwhile the man we@@ ars a bald head .
the man should not be addressed directly .
he could still carry the weapon in himself , like the police .
if you see Sven S. , you should call 110 .
the police speak of a &quot; rel@@ ational state . &quot;
the victim was born in 1988 , the perpet@@ r@@ ator in 1981 .
the responsible police in Lü@@ beck at first did not want to give any information about the Ta@@ vern or the relationship between perpet@@ rators and victims ; but she confirmed that a person had been killed .
&quot; it is a crime crime . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we don &apos;t say more at this time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a police spokes@@ woman in Lü@@ beck . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to e@@ ye@@ witnesses , a Special Operations Command ( SE@@ K ) was at the scene of the crime .
steel - Licht@@ blick for the German Steel Industry
the crisis @-@ packed and energy @-@ intensive German steel industry remains unaffected by additional costs in millions of euros .
financial burdens arising from the sector of green electricity production are from the table .
the German Federal Minister for Economic Affairs , Sig@@ mar Gabriel ( SPD ) , said the &quot; West German Allgemeine Zeitung &quot; ( WA@@ Z , Friday edition ) at the release of the Renewable Energy Suppl@@ ement in the existing plants for the so @-@ called self @-@ current production in the German steel industry .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m really happy that we could finally reach this after two years of tough negotiations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the European Commission therefore initially planned to ask the steel producers to use the gas from the blast furnace to generate electricity for their own consumption .
according to the German industry association , the steel industry has threatened additional costs of 120 to 240 million euros a year .
Gabriel said the WA@@ Z , there is now a basic agreement with the European Commission for talks with Commissioner Mar@@ gre@@ the V@@ est@@ ager .
only when the generators are replaced in the steel plants , an EEG reserve of 20 percent would fall .
but even this is not raised in the steel industry .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; IG Metall welcomed Germany &apos;s agreement with the European Commission on self @-@ electricity generation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
as a result , the status quo is largely dict@@ ated by the current regulation .
Gabriel &apos;s successful effort for the steel industry is of particular importance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in view of our &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Steel is Future &quot; campaign is this a first step . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; more must follow . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; even in the reform of emission trading trade , climate and employment targets must be weigh@@ ed down , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stated IG Metall CEO Jörg Hof@@ mann in Frankfurt . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
since the financial crisis in 2008 , the steel industry in Europe has been suffering from over@@ capacity and considerable price pressure .
last year , the situation continued to ag@@ grav@@ ate when the world &apos;s largest producer of producers threw steel on the world market in view of the weak@@ ening domestic demand .
European manufacturers acc@@ use Chinese steel companies price dump@@ ing .
in the course of this spring , the situation has eased a little .
on the one hand , imported import duties on import @-@ steel have effect , on the other hand , the economic prospects in China have brigh@@ tened .
it is not clear how sustainable the price collection is .
the German industry leader Th@@ ys@@ senk@@ ru@@ pp was cau@@ tious on Thursday .
last but not least the prices would have stagn@@ ated more .
the industry respon@@ ds to the difficult situation with further cost reductions .
at last , Th@@ ys@@ sen@@ Kru@@ pp did not want to exclude certain closures of individual works .
at the end of 2015 , some 8@@ ,000 people were employed in the German steel industry .
in July , the German steel manufacturers are cau@@ tious despite rising prices and increasing orders .
at 3.4 million tonnes , they produced a good six percent less crude steel than the previous year &apos;s month , as the Steel Community announced on Friday .
after a short increase in May , the quantity produced was returned to the second month .
since the beginning of the year , production has been around two percent lower than the previous year &apos;s figure .
in the coming months , the association expects an improved order situation with increasing output .
community , mind , health : singing does sen@@ iors good
the singing has accompanied Ur@@ sel Ki@@ pp all her life : as a young girl she was in the school choir , in the Magi@@ st@@ erium course she occupied the subject of music , and today the 78 @-@ year @-@ old sings in a sen@@ iors choir .
&quot; singing moves me - emotion@@ ally and physically , &quot; she describes .
after a rehear@@ sal , she feels balanced , cheerful and more alive , she says .
by the way , she does something good in her health and mind .
because singing is a great hobby for sen@@ iors from several perspectives , says Er@@ hard H@@ ac@@ kler from the German senior league .
most sen@@ iors sing in the choir and share with like @-@ minded people the joy of music , describes H@@ ac@@ kler .
through regular meetings , sen@@ iors can soci@@ alize and maintain social contacts .
because often social and family structures dissolve in old age , a choir is then an ideal opportunity to spend time with other people .
this experience has also made Ur@@ sel Ki@@ pp in her choir : &quot; to talk and organise , to be able to rely on others and to learn from each other - a choir is a very special form of being together . &quot;
singing can be exhau@@ sting in the positive sense , says H@@ ac@@ kler .
for doing so , sen@@ iors train a deep and controlled breathing .
those who regularly demand their lungs are not so fast in everyday life .
even if it is about getting the sound of the voice in old age , singing is an optimal hobby .
for older people , S@@ ingen often has a very special effect , says Ursul@@ a L@@ enz from the Federal Association of Sen@@ iors .
in the older generations the common singing had a much higher value , it belonged to everyday life , both in school and in leisure , it explains .
L@@ enz often ob@@ serves that singing or listening to songs in elderly people awak@@ ens many memories , often associated with positive feelings of their youth .
through lyrics and especially melodies , dementia @-@ sick people de@@ compose to long @-@ lying events .
while singing , a special achievement is demanded to the head , explains L@@ enz .
to concentrate simultaneously on one &apos;s own voice and to a given rhythm and adapt to the other singers - this is a major cognitive challenge .
just older people who live alone are doing so not only to concentrate on themselves .
another positive aspect is the recognition that one lear@@ ns through singing in the choir , says H@@ ac@@ kler .
an enthusiastic audience is a great praise .
the self @-@ este@@ em also grows through singing in the choir .
to show yourself : if I practise for something long , I get better and grow beyond me - this experience strengthens .
good reasons to start singing , so there is enough .
those who want to try out a new hobby should not hesitate - even if he thinks he has little talent , L@@ enz advises .
you don &apos;t sing alone - with 50 singing people , who hears when a ton goes beside it ?
in search of the right offer , sen@@ iors have different options , says H@@ ac@@ kler .
if someone sings from the circle of acquain@@ tance in a senior choir , you can simply join .
many cities also offer views of the choirs in the surroundings .
those who want to sing in a church choir can turn directly to the church or the church leader .
many senior choirs can also be found on the internet .
anyone who has no access to the Internet can ask the family , friends or neighbours for help in the internet research .
those who want to sing should definitely join a choir , advises H@@ ac@@ kler .
singing does the soul good and has something liber@@ ating - that is true for all ages .
cats react more sensi@@ tively than males to scre@@ ams of the k@@ itt@@ ens
bi@@ ologists have investigated in Hanover what effect the calls of cat babies have on adult animals .
to their surprise , also the males did not leave the males cold - however they always beha@@ ved in the difference to the females always the same .
female cats can recognize the degree of reg@@ ression of cat babies at the sight of the little ones .
they react by ten percent faster to sounds of k@@ itt@@ ens who are in great need , as scientists have found out from the Veter@@ inary Academy and the Hannover Medical School ( MH@@ H ) .
males also react to the calls of k@@ itt@@ ens - however always the same .
&quot; obviously the acoustic differences between the mi@@ ch@@ ewing of less and strongly excited young for the males are either not percep@@ tible or not of significance , &quot; said the bi@@ ologist Wi@@ eb@@ ke Kon@@ er@@ ding from the MH@@ H .
she is the first author of the study published on this Friday in the journal &quot; BM@@ C Evol@@ ution@@ ary Biology . &quot;
in a previous investigation , the research team had already found out that the duration and pitch of the k@@ itt@@ ens cri@@ es differ@@ ed with the ur@@ gency of their need@@ iness .
nine adult males and eight female k@@ itt@@ ens were observed from the animal hus@@ band@@ ry of the MH@@ H .
they were played for a rep@@ ut@@ ations of little ones , taken from the litter box for three minutes and separated from mother and si@@ bl@@ ings .
on the other hand , they were confronted with cri@@ es of more excited k@@ itt@@ ens , which were raised in addition .
despite the small sample of the sample , the researchers keep their results meaningful .
&quot; all the females , even those who have not had their own offspring , re@@ acted differentiated to the scre@@ ams , &quot; Kon@@ er@@ ding said .
they turned around faster to the loudspeaker , when this calls played out the very excited k@@ itt@@ ens .
this ability may possibly be inn@@ ate or develop with sexual maturity .
&quot; a surprise was that the males did react at all , &quot; said the bi@@ ologist .
in the past , scientists have repeatedly examined the reactions of women and men to baby no@@ ises in humans .
some studies showed that women re@@ acted more sensi@@ tively to babies , regardless of whether they were already mothers or not , told the bi@@ ologist Marina Sche@@ um@@ ann .
Po@@ dol@@ sky acc@@ esses the Super@@ cup with &quot; Gala &quot;
Hak@@ an Sü@@ ku@@ r is a football legend in Turkey .
a arrest warrant has been issued against the former S@@ occ@@ er Hak@@ an Sü@@ ver in Turkey .
he is accused of being a member of a terrorist group .
for the first time after the attempted coup attempt , an important football match will take place in Turkey .
before the du@@ el of the arch@@ rival between Bes@@ ik@@ tas Istanbul and Lukas Po@@ dol@@ sky Gal@@ at@@ as@@ ar@@ ay Istanbul around the Super@@ cup in Kon@@ ya , the official line is clear : &quot; business as usual &quot; is announced .
even with the im@@ position of the state of emergency after the attempted coup attempt in July , the government felt that the everyday life of normal citizens should not be com@@ promised .
but this does not apply to those who are suspected of belonging to the movement of the Pre@@ acher Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len , which is responsible for the attempted coup attempt .
it is also not stopped in front of football .
the public prosec@@ utor issued an arrest warrant against the former Stark@@ ie Hak@@ an Sü@@ thu@@ b .
accordingly , South America living in America is accused of being a member of a terrorist group .
Sü@@ ku@@ r should be followers of the Pre@@ acher Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len , who is responsible for the coup attempt by President Rec@@ ep Tay@@ y@@ ip Erdo@@ gan .
although the exception is for 90 days , it is still valid until October , but in fact that has no effect on the lives of most Turks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the ni@@ gh@@ tly &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; democracy guards &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in public places throughout the country has declared Erdoğan on Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the sport is - like the whole country - split into supporters and enemies of Erdo@@ gan .
especially fans of the worker @-@ club Bes@@ ik@@ tas are traditionally not among the friends of the president .
but what unites the majority of the Turks in the face of dramatic experiences in history is the strict rejection of military put@@ ties .
even the fans agree - no matter if their heart beats for Gal@@ at@@ as@@ ar@@ ay or Bes@@ ik@@ tas .
at Po@@ kal@@ si@@ eger &quot; Gala , &quot; there will be a special response to Lukas Po@@ dol@@ ski .
Cologne presented its sporty value in the past season : with 17 gates and nine templates in all competitions , the 31 @-@ year @-@ old ended his first playing time as a top scor@@ er of his association .
in the final match against F@@ ener@@ bah@@ ce he achieved the 1 : 0 victory hit .
the newspaper &quot; FA@@ NA@@ TI@@ K &quot; che@@ ered him : &quot; he was the best in the place . &quot;
he finished the season in an excellent way and his team secured the tro@@ phy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thanks to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pol@@ di &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the dis@@ ap@@ pointing season for the record master found a conci@@ li@@ atory conclusion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the pre @-@ round K.@@ O in the Champions League , the &quot; lions &quot; also leave early in the Europa League .
in the Sü@@ per Li@@ g , it was only sixth .
the season was not good .
the cup was the only way to win something .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have done this and that is the most important thing , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Po@@ dol@@ sky . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for Master Bes@@ ik@@ tas , the game year was better .
especially thanks to Mario Gom@@ ez , who laid the basis for the 14th title as Sü@@ per @-@ Li@@ g @-@ Tor@@ cher King with 26 seasons of the season .
this is also the reason that the fans will continue to hope for the return of the 31 @-@ year @-@ old .
at the time of AC Florence , the Gom@@ ez only rented out under contract and sent to Bes@@ ik@@ tas after the attempted coup attempt failed to return because of the political situation in the country after his EM holiday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if Mario wants to come to us , he only needs to say , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; cited the magazine &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ki@@ cker &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Club CEO Fi@@ kre@@ t Or@@ man . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the storm would have to be willing to ren@@ ounce about a third of its estimated par value of 7.5 million Euros , Or@@ man made clear that &quot; his salary at Florence cannot be paid . &quot;
despite dop@@ ing : these athletes have med@@ als opportunities at Olympia in Rio
the 34 @-@ year @-@ old Jus@@ tin Gat@@ lin was locked twice for dop@@ ing ( 2001 and 2006 ) .
Rio de Jan@@ eiro - W@@ hist@@ le@@ blo@@ wer@@ in Julia Step@@ an@@ ova is not allowed to start in Rio .
other convic@@ ted athle@@ tics sinners can only laugh about it - they fight in Rio for med@@ als .
the theme of dop@@ ing is still the head@@ lines at the Rio Olympics .
the Russian s@@ wimm@@ ers Juli@@ ja Je@@ fi@@ m@@ owa , who after a dop@@ ing lock compl@@ ained their start right just before the games , was st@@ un@@ ned and hat@@ ched mer@@ cil@@ essly at her start ( 100 meters chest ) .
a whi@@ m@@ si@@ cal scenery was offered : she was still in the hall with a set smile and provoked her appearance .
when she found out that she won &apos;t get gold , the audience broke out into a che@@ ering tower .
but there are numerous other sports@@ men who go to the start despite the dop@@ ing past at the Rio Olympics .
here is an overview :
Jus@@ tin Gat@@ lin ( 100 , 200 , 4x@@ 100 @-@ m @-@ season / USA ) : the 34 @-@ year @-@ old is one of the most controversial figures in athle@@ tics .
he was already locked twice for dop@@ ing ( 2001 and 2006 to 2010 ) .
since its spell the Olympic Champion of 2004 and ex @-@ World Champion is even faster than before , he is the number one in the world over 100 m in 9.@@ 80 seconds and is regarded as the greatest chall@@ enger of U@@ sa@@ in Bol@@ t .
Shel@@ ly @-@ An@@ n F@@ ras@@ er @-@ Pr@@ yce ( 100 , 4x@@ 100 @-@ m @-@ season / Jam@@ ai@@ ka ) : the two @-@ time Olympic champion and seven times world champion had to shut down a six @-@ month lock in 2010 after receiving the pain using Ox@@ y@@ co@@ don .
after an operation she had a strong tooth@@ ache , the 29 @-@ year @-@ old was defending herself .
Sandra Per@@ ko@@ vic ( Dis@@ cus / Croatia ) : in 2011 , the Olympic champion of 2012 , World Champion in 2013 and European Champion , was tested positively by the banned stimul@@ ant meth@@ yl@@ hex@@ an@@ amine from 2010 to 2016 .
Per@@ ko@@ vic denied the scientific intake and was closed for six months .
the four far@@ th@@ est th@@ rows this year go to the account of the big gold @-@ fav@@ ori@@ tin .
La@@ Sha@@ wn Mer@@ ritt ( 200 , 400 , 4x@@ 400 @-@ m @-@ Season / USA ) : the Beijing Olympic Champion and two @-@ time World Champion over 400 m , had been positively tested in 2010 and locked for 21 months in 2010 .
a means of penis enlargement have been responsible , em@@ bed Mer@@ ritt .
this year , the 30 @-@ year @-@ old is the fastest man in the world over 200 and 400 m .
I@@ wan T@@ ich@@ on ( Hammer@@ fall , Belarus ) : hardly any ath@@ lete has been awarded as many med@@ als afterwards .
thus T@@ ich@@ on lost his World Cup title from 2005 nine years later , after having found testosterone dop@@ ing in him .
the 40 @-@ year @-@ old also had to release the Olympic silver in 2004 because of ster@@ oid dop@@ ing and the 2006 European title because of testosterone abuse .
he also received the bronze medal of the 2008 Olympic Games on the basis of a judgment of the International Sports Court CA@@ S .
at 8@@ 0,@@ 04 m he is in rank two of the world rank@@ ings .
Li@@ u Hong ( 20 km walk , China ) : the world record holder and Gold@@ fav@@ ori@@ tin were first tested in May , but may still start in Rio .
in the 29 @-@ year @-@ old world champion , instructions for taking a prohibited food supplement were found , the lock of the World Anti @-@ Dop@@ ing agency WA@@ DA coinci@@ ded mil@@ dly and ran off on July 13th .
bomb terror in Thailand - Austrian injured - Sever@@ al dead
the Austrian Embassy in Thailand is in contact with the woman , said the spokes@@ man of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs , Thomas Schn@@ ö@@ ll , Friday .
she suffered injuries and had been treated in the hospital , but I have already left it .
she planned her home trip for the beginning of September .
whether the further explo@@ sions on the holiday island of Ph@@ u@@ ket as well as in the southern cities of Sur@@ at Th@@ ani , Ph@@ ang N@@ ga , Tran@@ g and Ch@@ um@@ phon are also Austrian citizens , be unclear for the time being .
the Ministry of Foreign Affairs is in constant contact with the local authorities .
Hu@@ a H@@ in , located approximately 200 kilometres south of Bangkok &apos;s capital , were initially explo@@ ded by two bombs on Thursday evening .
according to the police , a Thai woman was killed and about 20 people were injured , including the Austrian , three Germans , three Dutch and three Itali@@ ans .
Friday morning two explo@@ sives went up again , and another person was killed according to the authorities .
also from Ph@@ u@@ ket a bomb explosion was reported in the morning .
a taxi driver was injured in the det@@ onation in the vicinity of the popular bathing beach in Pat@@ ong .
in Sur@@ at Th@@ ani on the south @-@ east coast of the country another bomb explo@@ ded , killing an urban cler@@ k .
according to the authorities in a flower be@@ et , the explosive device went into the air in front of the territory of the coastal police .
finally , det@@ on@@ ations in Ph@@ ang N@@ ga and Tran@@ g on the south @-@ west coast as well as in Ch@@ um@@ phon on the south @-@ eastern coast demanded several injuries .
it was said that there was a connection with the explo@@ sions in Hu@@ a H@@ in .
&quot; the bomb attacks carry the same manuscript , &quot; said Army general Dan@@ ai K@@ rit@@ am@@ av@@ ee Friday morning to journalists .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we assume that this is a coordinated attack . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is too early to manifest themselves as possible motives , but it is likely to be the acts of Muslim rebels .
Thai media also wanted to recognize a pattern typical of the bom@@ b@@ ings of Muslim separ@@ ati@@ sts in the south of the country .
the Thai police , on the other hand , declared that the attacks were not in connection with the Islam@@ ist insur@@ rec@@ tionary movement or with international terrorism .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is only local sab@@ otage which is limited to limited areas and provinces , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a spokes@@ man in Bangkok . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
rather , it is assumed that the bombs were placed by opponents of the ruling military j@@ un@@ ta .
in the past few days , the authorities would have kept secret indications of im@@ min@@ ent attacks in the south of the country - however , they were not informed about the exact time and places .
it is still unclear which group is behind the attacks .
the police put their officials across the country to enhance security around important government buildings as well as airports , train stations , tourist attractions , restaurants and entertainment districts .
in Thailand there are again and again smaller bom@@ b@@ ings , but mostly do not address tourists .
in Hu@@ a H@@ in is a palace that was used over the years by Thailand &apos;s King B@@ hum@@ i@@ bo@@ l Ad@@ ul@@ y@@ ade@@ j .
after the bomb explo@@ sions , the Austrian Ministry of Foreign Affairs strongly recommends that the Thai security authorities follow the instructions of the Thai security authorities .
high security risk ( security level 3 ) applies to the provinces of Nar@@ ath@@ i@@ w@@ at , Y@@ ala , P@@ att@@ ani and Son@@ gh@@ kl@@ a as well as Pre@@ ah V@@ ih@@ ear and its surroundings .
after confron@@ tations between security forces and Muslim populations , not necessary trips to these provinces will be dis@@ cour@@ aged .
increased security risk ( security level 2 ) applies to the rest of the country .
the attacks on Thursday and Friday took place a few days after a controversial referendum on a constitution dra@@ fted by the military j@@ un@@ ta .
this gives the military great influence over the coming years .
Jun@@ ta CEO and Prime Minister Pra@@ y@@ ut Ch@@ an @-@ o @-@ cha said that the bombs were an attempt to fom@@ ent chaos while the country moves toward stability , improving economic conditions and tourism .
the military un@@ ta , which had seized power in 2014 after a period of bloody tur@@ mo@@ il , will benefit herself to restore the kingdom again to stability and order .
however , the military has not managed to get a grip on the revol@@ ting insur@@ gency of Muslim rebels for years in the extreme south of the country .
more than 6@@ 500 people have already been killed in the conflict .
almost a year ago , in Bangkok , 20 people were killed in a stop by a popular Hin@@ du shr@@ ine - most of them foreign tourists .
it was the bloo@@ dies@@ t stop of the recent history of the country .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the right &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; identical movement &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is targeted at the Federal Office of Constitutional Protection . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to several regional offices , the constitutional guar@@ dians in the federal government have also placed the group under observation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we see evidence of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Identi@@ ty Movement &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for aspir@@ ations against the liberal democratic constitution , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said constitutional chief Hans @-@ Georg Ma@@ aß &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Berlin . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in this way , immigrants in Islamic faith or from the Middle East are being diff@@ used in extrem@@ ist ways .
that &apos;s why we are watching the movement now .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; identical movement &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is a group@@ ing with French roots , which has been active in Germany since 2012 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is directed against &quot; Mul@@ tik@@ ul@@ ti @-@ W@@ ahn , &quot; &quot; un@@ controlled mass immigration &quot; and the &quot; loss of one &apos;s own identity by est@@ ran@@ gement . &quot;
constitutional guards in nine federal states - Bremen , Bavaria , Hessen , Berlin , Baden @-@ Württemberg , NRW , Lower Saxony , Saxony and Thur@@ in@@ gia - are already observing the &quot; identi@@ fiers . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ma@@ iden said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; his authority was closely aligned with the offices . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; groups like the &apos; identical movement &apos; attempt to pick up their target group where it stands , &quot; said the Chief of the Constitutional Court .
in general , extre@@ mi@@ sts try to address them with you@@ thful language , often with p@@ opp@@ y music .
the fac@@ ul@@ ties of Islam@@ ists as well as right @-@ wing extre@@ mi@@ sts .
this is not a solic@@ it@@ ous advertisement for one &apos;s own thing .
propaganda should appeal to people emotion@@ ally .
young people are particularly vulnerable .
this is dangerous .
last but not least , there were reports on contacts of the &quot; identi@@ ties &quot; to Af@@ D politicians from several federal states .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ma@@ iden said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for the constitutional protection , possible contacts of this species are only relevant at a certain point .
it depends on whether the respective party - in this case the Af@@ D - changes its target direction by certain individuals who are extrem@@ ist and so extrem@@ ist .
the decisive factor is whether such persons have a controlling influence on the party .
this is not to be seen .
with a view to the significant increase in illegal crimes and attacks on asylum seek@@ ers and refugee shel@@ ters , Ma@@ fia said he would not yet speak of new righ@@ tist terrorism .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but we have established in recent years that there can be ri@@ ght@@ less structures . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there was the group &apos; Old School Society &apos; or the Frei@@ tal Group .
it may be possible that further ri@@ ghtful terrorist groups or small groups are planning to plan the attacks against asylum seek@@ ers , refugee homes or attacks from other right @-@ wing extrem@@ ist motives .
however , a nationwide or pan @-@ European control of right @-@ wing terrorism is not recognizable .
the previous groups were created on the regional level or in social networks .
they expressed concern about the fact that many attacks came to the account of people who had not previously appeared in the right scene .
that is the wor@@ rying .
many of the crimes suspect in case of attacks on asylum accommodation were not known as criminals , politically motivated offen@@ ders or supporters of the right @-@ wing scene .
&quot; a lot of people have committed criminal off@@ ences , who previously had nothing to do with righ@@ tist extre@@ mi@@ sts who were perhaps politically indiffer@@ ent or elected for example CD@@ U , SPD or lef@@ ti@@ sts , which , however , have radic@@ alized themselves through right @-@ wing extre@@ mi@@ sts . &quot;
Rio 2016 : RO@@ BE@@ L Ki@@ ros Gre@@ te becomes an Inter@@ ne@@ th@@ ite
not always the Olympi@@ ans or world records determine the head@@ lines at the Olympic Games .
this shows the bold show of Ro@@ bel Ki@@ rill : at the summer games in Rio de Jan@@ eiro .
in the Aqu@@ atics Center the slightly overl@@ apping s@@ wimm@@ ers from Ethiopia slowly sw@@ am so slowly that it was no longer seen in the TV pictures .
he simply disappeared - no matter how far the detail was chosen .
then , in the social networks , Hab@@ te became the viral interim .
in fact , the 24 @-@ year @-@ old ended up with a gap of 48 seconds and finished the 59@@ th position of 59 star@@ ters .
but it was rather its not exactly sporty figure that attracted the attention of the international media .
why does the 24 @-@ year @-@ old participate in the Olympics ?
the Ethiop@@ ian got a special start right from the international swimming association .
this is distributed to make swimming in under@@ represented countries more popular .
since most athletes are running in Ethiopia , I just wanted to do something different .
preparation is all : RO@@ BE@@ L Ki@@ cker Hab@@ te is ready for the big race .
quickly the first nick@@ names made the rounds .
some media referred it as &quot; ro@@ ar of the wh@@ ale . &quot;
based on a &quot; well @-@ being &quot; the English tab@@ lo@@ id &quot; The Sun &quot; made fun of him with &quot; D@@ ad B@@ od . &quot;
his time , he only struck a minute and almost five seconds over the 100 meter free @-@ style , played no role .
compar@@ isons with &quot; Eric the E@@ el &quot; were also drawn .
Eric M@@ ous@@ sam@@ ban@@ i created media attention at the Olympic Games 2000 in Sydney .
unforgettable was the appearance of the swimming pool from Equ@@ at@@ orial Guinea , when he had to compete in a pre @-@ run over 100 m Fre@@ estyle alone .
M@@ ous@@ sam@@ ban@@ i was then fired f@@ ren@@ e@@ tically at that time .
the then 22 @-@ year @-@ old learned to swim in front of Olympia eight months and had never completed such a long distance before the competition .

Ger@@ ets@@ ried - The owner of a shop at the New Place has been fo@@ aled .
according to the police , the 67 @-@ year @-@ old Ger@@ ets@@ rie@@ der@@ in left their business on Monday at 5.@@ 30 pm and forgot to close a window on the ground floor .

Tr@@ ump sees the im@@ pending electoral defeat
the Republi@@ can presidential candidate Donald Tr@@ ump speaks at a campaign event in Florida .
should there be nothing with the election to the US president , Donald Tr@@ ump has an alternative video .
he then goes on vacation .
lo@@ osing Donald Tr@@ ump the U.S. presidential elections in November , it wouldn &apos;t matter to him : &quot; in the end it will either work , or I have a very , very nice , long holiday , &quot; said the candidate of the Republi@@ cans in a telephone interview with the US television station CN@@ BC .
if it did not suff@@ ice for him at the end for reasons of political correctness , that was right , said Tr@@ ump .
he described US President Barack Obama and the Democrats , H@@ illary Clinton , as the founder of the terrorist militia Islamic State ( IS ) .
within his party , more and more resistance was formed .
post is entering the trade with electric @-@ transpor@@ ters
an electric car of the Deutsche Post in action .
the interest of other companies on the vehicle is obviously great .
the post is planning to sell its electric vehicle Stre@@ et@@ Sco@@ oter .
in brief , the Group plans to launch the trade with the transpor@@ ter .
next year , the postal bus wants to offer its electric transpor@@ ters on the free car market .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to enter the sale to third parties , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a post @-@ spokes@@ man on Friday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the company has been checking for months whether they want to sell their self @-@ developed Stre@@ et@@ Sco@@ oter with the letters and pack@@ ets to sell to other companies .
post @-@ director Jürgen Ger@@ den said that there are always inquiries , such as handic@@ ra@@ fts@@ men .
according to the news magazine Der Spiegel , &quot; the Bon@@ ner Group will shortly be entering the mass production of vehicles .
in its own fabri@@ cation , the company plans to build up to 10,000 cars per year and shift .
Ger@@ d announced that the Group wanted to significantly increase its fleet of electric cars and make a long @-@ term transition to environmentally friendly vehicles .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will make a very robust step towards 2020 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said at the end of July . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I can imagine that we change the whole fleet .
the Stre@@ et@@ Sco@@ oter has been active on Germany &apos;s roads since 2014 .
GF@@ RP leading to dis@@ ap@@ pointing business figures
the consumer research company G@@ f@@ K exchanges his boss Matthias Hart@@ mann .
the tail@@ oring came suddenly - but not quite surprising .
the difficult situation of the market research company G@@ f@@ K fores@@ had@@ owed that the chair of CEO Matthias Hart@@ mann becomes even more uncertain , the longer the successes promised by him .
turbul@@ ence at the top of the Nuremberg market research company G@@ f@@ K : after again dis@@ ap@@ pointing business figures and the res@@ ignation of corporate management , the world &apos;s number five represents a new beginning .
GF@@ RP Chief Executive Officer wants to leave the company at the end of the year .
the Chairman of the G@@ f@@ K Supervisory Board Ar@@ no Mahl@@ ert already dischar@@ ges from the Supervisory Board with effect from 12 September .
as early as September 1 , the leadership of the Executive Board will take over the previous board member Gerhard Haus@@ ru@@ ck@@ inger , informed the company .
he shall officially assume the function of a &quot; CEO , &quot; until a successor is found for Hart@@ mann .
as a reason for the res@@ ign@@ ations , the company called &quot; different views &quot; for long @-@ term business policy orientation .
details did not want to name a company spokes@@ man on Friday .
who will be the market research company in the future , is still unclear at present .
it was in An@@ le@@ ger@@ ence on Friday that the shareholders were recently disappointed with the dis@@ appointment of the continued success of the restructuring initiated years ago .
Mr. Hart@@ mann has been at the G@@ f@@ K top since 2011 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but the fruits of restructuring are not to be seen even after 5 years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in view of the last bad G@@ f@@ K business figures , each shareholder will eventually become rest@@ less at some point .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if that would be the case with BMW , it would also do the torture , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after set@@ backs in the previous quarters , the company did not stop its losses in the second quarter of 2016 .
at € 36@@ 1.2 million , sales were 6.1 percent lower than the comparable prior @-@ year figure .
in the first half of the year , sales of 7@@ 21.@@ 2 million euros shr@@ ank by 3.4 percent .
in view of its difficult economic situation , earnings in the second quarter mainly imp@@ acted the company &apos;s s@@ unken asset .
the Group &apos;s sales of EUR 139 million , which were needed in the Consumer Experience business unit , gave the Group a loss of 14@@ 8.2 million euros .
in the second quarter of 2015 , G@@ f@@ K still managed to generate a consolidated profit of 19.@@ 7 million .
accidents - Bus sli@@ ps in Kr@@ um@@ m@@ hör@@ n in Gra@@ ben : eight wounded
in the event of an accident involving 43 senior passengers as passengers , eight people were injured in Kr@@ um@@ m@@ hör@@ n on Thursday .
two of the occup@@ ants suffered severe injuries , shared the police with them .
according to her data , the 66 @-@ year @-@ old driver of the coach of a travel company from Eisen@@ ach , according to her information , had to ev@@ ade a vice that was partly on the road .
the bus came to the right of the road and sli@@ d into a dit@@ ch , as a spokes@@ woman of the police Aur@@ ich / Witt@@ mund reported .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to the location of the bus , the people could not leave the bus independently , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the fire bri@@ g@@ ade liber@@ ated the occup@@ ants .
six ambul@@ ances and a ambul@@ ance ambul@@ ance came to the accident site on the provincial road 2 .
the un@@ injured trav@@ eller was brought back to Kr@@ um@@ m@@ hör@@ ner district of P@@ ew@@ sum .
there they should wait for a replacement bus of the travel company .
the investig@@ ators asked the truck driver and possible witnesses to report to the police .
the fees per cubic metre of wastewater amount to 3,@@ 44 instead of 2.@@ 10 euros for the sewage plant in Neu@@ dorf / Re@@ uth / Wel@@ h@@ ahl 3.@@ 44 as from 1 October 2016 ; for Zul@@ ten@@ berg / Lin@@ den@@ berg / L@@ opp 3,@@ 36 euros ( currently 2.@@ 26 euros ) and for Az@@ endorf 3.@@ 64 euros ( up to now 2.@@ 18 euros ) .
at the plant in Az@@ endorf , the waste water fee will be increased at the latest when appropriate improvement measures are necessary .
after a long @-@ term calculation , the waste water price in Az@@ endorf will then be at 4.@@ 37 euros per cubic metre .
as mayor Bernd Stein@@ häuser ( CS@@ U ) reported , at the approval of the budget by the district office Kul@@ mb@@ ach , Unter@@ deck@@ ungen had been established for these sewage systems .
due to legal foundations , the Kas@@ endorf market is obliged to operate the facilities in a cost @-@ covering manner .
as of 1 October 2016 , the citizens and the commercial and industrial companies from Wel@@ sh ahl , Neu@@ dorf , Re@@ uth , Az@@ endorf , L@@ opp , Lin@@ den@@ berg and Zul@@ ten@@ berg will have to go deeper into the pur@@ se .
fee increases are between 48 and 67 percent .
as Managing Director Herbert Schmidt presented the board , a new calculation of the fees for the wastewater facilities of the market community was necessary .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the period from October 2016 to September 2020 , also over and over @-@ covers from the previous calculation period are to be equ@@ ated . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the major rise in fees was based on the fact that all three wastewater facilities have relatively small facilities with a very low waste water intake , lying between 6@@ 800 and 1@@ 2000 cubic meters per year .
for example , due to the low distribution basis , expenses for necessary repairs of several thousand Euros would have a serious impact .
in addition , the waste water volume in all three plants is slightly decreasing .
furthermore , due to their age renovation and repair costs , in the rec@@ umbent cal@@ c@@ cul@@ ation period , renovation and repair costs have fallen to a considerable extent .
the plant in Az@@ endorf is nearly 30 years old , the facilities for Wel@@ sh ahl , Neu@@ dorf and Re@@ uth as well as Zul@@ ten@@ berg , Lin@@ den@@ berg and L@@ opp almost 20 years .
Schmidt showed that in the waste water system Az@@ endorf the mechanical ventilation system had to be replaced because of damage .
in the pumping station Wel@@ sh Steel , the almost 20 @-@ year @-@ old conveyor systems had to be over@@ hau@@ led from the ground up and at the L@@ opp pond treatment plant , the first sewage slu@@ dge had to be dischar@@ ged , the sewage slu@@ dge was dispos@@ ed of and an additional ventilation option was installed in order to meet the requirements of the water legal requirements in the future .
Schmidt : &quot; these extraordinary expenses resulted in the continued care and maintenance costs , which must be taken into account in accordance with the new calculation period . &quot;
the same applies to electricity costs , which were still considerably below the current level during the previous calculation in 2011 / 2012 .
stone houses made it clear that in the case of low waste water in the three plants , the expenses for the operation and maintenance were &quot; full . &quot;
Schmidt , the market community of large entertainment costs in the waste water installations in the past 20 years has been spar@@ ed .
the situation for the mentioned plants will remain prec@@ arious in the opinion of stone houses in the long run , especially since the supply area of the Fri@@ esen@@ bach@@ tal sewage treatment association can not be extended because it is a deficit .
Bulgaria registers for the first time in 8 months of inflation
national statistics show that in July , inflation in Bulgaria amounted to 1 % on a monthly basis .
this is the highest value ( since June 2012 ) and the first above zero since October last year , when positive 0.2 % were recorded .
the annual average rate of the last 12 months ( August 2015 - July 2016 ) compared to the previous 12 months ( August 2014 - July 2015 ) was measured according to the CP@@ I -@@ 0.8 % .
the consumer price index in July 2016 compared to June 2016 amounted to 10@@ 1.0 % , i.e. the monthly inflation amounted to 1.0 % .
the inflation rate since the beginning of the year ( July 2016 compared to December 2015 ) was -@@ 0.2 % and the annual inflation in July 2016 compared to July 2015 was -@@ 0.2 % .
in July 2016 , a price increase of the following groups of consumer goods was observed in comparison to the previous month : food and non @-@ alcoholic beverages ( 1.7 % ) ; transport ( 1.8 % ) ; leisure and culture ( 6.3 % ) ; restaurants and hotels ( 1.2 % ) ; various goods and services ( 0.3 % ) .
prices fell in clothing and shoes ( 2.2 % ) ; furniture , household appliances and routine maintenance ( 0.5 % ) ; health ( 0.1 % ) .
prices remained as in the pre @-@ month for alcoholic beverages and tobacco ; flats , water , electricity , gas and other fuels ; communication ; as well as education remained unchanged .
Snap@@ chat &quot; Ani@@ me &quot; -@@ Eff@@ ect critici@@ zed as an Asian car@@ ic@@ ature
Snap@@ chat says that this filter is anim@@ e @-@ inspired , but some ob@@ servers say it is in@@ sensitive to races .
with its filter tool , Snap@@ chat allows around 150 million daily users to change reality and play with identi@@ ties in such a way that borders on the absurd .
you can turn into a p@@ ine@@ apple , a dog or a figure that could be from a Roy Licht@@ enstein painting .
the filters are bl@@ unt , self @-@ rotating tools that generate more than 30 million improved sel@@ fies per day .
all mis@@ carriage returns to the public .
the Snap@@ chat filters have been critic@@ ised in the past in which they were charged that the Black@@ face app would promote or propag@@ ate white skin as a beauty ideal .
when this week proposed a filter to some users who gave them s@@ lit @-@ eyes , false teeth and blo@@ ated che@@ eks , some critics called it a rac@@ ist car@@ ic@@ ature of Asi@@ ans - &quot; yellow face . &quot;
they wonder@@ ed if these repeated controversi@@ es pointed to a greater problem that the company has diversity .
the news and ou@@ trage were widespread on Wednesday , with reports from The Ver@@ ge and Mo@@ ther@@ board , a day after Snap@@ chat announced that it would have de@@ activated the feature .
the company offered an ap@@ ology : the filter was intended as a tribute to anim@@ e characters and not as car@@ ic@@ ature of Asi@@ ans .
but out@@ si@@ ders who have experienced rac@@ ism reminded the filter of vulnerable c@@ lich@@ és .
others rejected the anim@@ e comparison .
in an e @-@ mail , Grace Spar@@ ap@@ ani , a Korean @-@ American art student whose tweet over the photos has been widely publi@@ ci@@ zed that the filter was &quot; vulnerable and mil@@ dly said unpleasant . &quot;
she added that &quot; it is difficult to argue with the ju@@ x@@ tap@@ osition of a very disgu@@ sting Asian carto@@ on@@ ist and the filter effects .
it shows that the filter is not yellow @-@ protected , but that the yellow face was pulled into the fl@@ aring extreme .
Snap@@ chat is not the only company that crosses these cultural stum@@ bling blocks .
American culture seems to be involved in an endless diversity of diversity and integration , from conference rooms to Hollywood and devices that we all hold in hand .
and Snap@@ ch@@ ats &apos;s great audience of young people - who are more vers@@ ed in the breed than their older opponents - might expect to expect sensitivity .
when one of Snap@@ ch@@ ats filters creates a picture that is insul@@ ting for a user , &quot; it is much more difficult that such items remain un@@ noticed than it was before , &quot; said the 25 @-@ year @-@ old K@@ atie Z@@ hu in an interview on Thursday .
on Thursday Z@@ hu , who worked as a product manager and engineer for medium , decided to er@@ ase her Snap@@ chat account and asked others to do the same .
in an es@@ say for medium and in a telephone interview , she said she believes that ra@@ cial controversi@@ es reflect a lack of diversity in the setting practices of Snap@@ chat .
Z@@ hu cri@@ tically critici@@ zed the white , only male leadership , and finished her es@@ say with a h@@ ash@@ tag : # Del@@ et@@ e@@ Snap@@ chat .
&quot; either they have no diverse representation of people with other skin colors in their staff so that they can make such decisions , &quot; said the Chinese Z@@ hu , &quot; or they have people with other skin colors that work there but are not in positions where they feel safe or comfortable to say about it . &quot;
others share their opinion , a complaint that has largely left Snap@@ chat un@@ answered .
the company does not publish figures on the diversity of its workforce and indicates its status as a private company .
on Thursday , it rejected Snap@@ chat to discuss the cultural background of its employees , but according to a spokes@@ man , the company recently hired a personnel responsible focusing on under@@ represented population groups and internal integration efforts .
Z@@ hu in turn said that she will have her Snap@@ chat account closed and added , &quot; I wonder if they need more users than us to say that it is not O.@@ K. . &quot;
military leadership fal@@ si@@ fies IS@@ IS intelligence information , establishes committee of Congress
military personnel of the United States Central Command changed intelligence @-@ to @-@ order information in order to draw an optim@@ istic picture of the war against the so @-@ called Islamic State in Iraq and Syria when the actual conditions were allowed on site , an investigation committee of the Congress reported in a report on Thursday .
the preliminary report , created by a Task Force of the republi@@ can members of the army committee , secret service committees , and the military budget , reports of great dis@@ satisfaction among Central Command Secret Service analysts who reported how superi@@ ors changed their estimates to American efforts in the fight against the Islamic State .
the Central Command , short C@@ en@@ com , is the military headquarters in T@@ amp@@ a , Florida , which controls the American military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia .
&quot; intelligence intelligence , typically inspired by high @-@ ranking Cent@@ Com com@@ man@@ ders , regularly recorded a positive image of US efforts against terrorism as it allowed the actual conditions on site and were consistently positive as analyses of other intelligence agencies , &quot; a newspaper article cited the report .
&quot; what happened at Cent@@ Com is unacceptable - our soldiers suffer if bad analyses are presented to our political leaders , &quot; K@@ en Cal@@ vert , a member of the House of Repres@@ ent@@ atives , established .
the management mistakes in the Cent@@ Com reach the top of the organization .
the ten @-@ page report shows detailed problems in the years 2014 and 2015 in the descriptions and analysis of American efforts in the formation of the Iraqi forces .
although there is no direct indication that government peaks under Obama have given instructions to change reports , it shows how analysts saw themselves exposed to pressure from their superi@@ ors , an optim@@ istic picture of the threat of the Islamic State , also known as IS@@ IS or IS@@ IL .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; during the first half of 2015 , many Central Command Press Rel@@ eases , comments and statements prior to the congress were much more positive than it corresponds to the facts &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for example , a Cent@@ Com member publicly announced that a military re@@ conquest of Mos@@ sul@@ s could begin in April or May 2015 .
Mos@@ ul , the second largest city in Iraq , remains under the control of the Islamic State .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after months of investigations , so much is clear . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mike Pom@@ pe@@ o , Republi@@ can Con@@ gres@@ s@@ man from K@@ ans@@ as , in a statement . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
from the middle of 2014 to the middle of 2015 , the leaders of the Central Command changed the intelligence reports to play the threat of IS@@ IS in Iraq .
the Republi@@ cans called the Task Force to life after they were admitted that analysts were concerned about the manipulation of reports on the Islamic State .
the report published on Thursday will be completed by more detailed findings while the investigations are continued .
in addition , further investigation of Cent@@ Com reports is underway due to the Chief In@@ spec@@ tor of the Ministry of Defense .
democratic members of the Intelligence Committee published their own findings on Thursday that coinci@@ ded with some of the conclusions of the Republi@@ can Task Force .
&quot; in 2014 and 2015 , Cent@@ Com has created an exc@@ essively limited process for the creation of intelligence assessments of IS@@ IL and the Iraqi security services , &quot; announced the highest level demo@@ cra@@ t in the committee , Member of the House of Repres@@ ent@@ atives Adam B. Schiff , in a statement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this process , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mr Schiff , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; delayed the publication of intelligence reports , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reported mor@@ als among analysts and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; gave too little space for diver@@ gent opinions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but Mr. Schiff and the Democrats gave no clu@@ es to the intervention of the White House at the Cent@@ Com analysts with regard to a &quot; certain political opinion . &quot;
the preliminary results of the investigation of the Congress were published on Tuesday by &quot; The Daily Be@@ ast . &quot;
last August , the New York Times reported investigations by the Pentagon &apos;s general inspec@@ tor , who were admitted to Cent@@ Com analysts &quot; complaints .
according to C@@ m@@ dr@@ . Patrick Ev@@ ans , a Pentagon spokes@@ man , stated in a statement that the Ministry of Defence would not comment on the Congress , while the investigations of the General In@@ spec@@ tor are still under way .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but he also stated that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; experts can sometimes have diver@@ gent opinions about the interpretation of complex data and that the intelligence services and the Ministry of Defence welcome a controversial discussion of these important issues of national defence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the investigations have re@@ perc@@ ussions on the question of a successful air campaign led by American leadership in Iraq and Syria ( an asser@@ tion that is now being made by a growing number of members of the Ministry of Defense ) .
however , the alleg@@ ations of last year raised the question to what extent President Obama can rely on Central Command for honest assessments of military operations in Iraq , Afghanistan , Libya and other crisis regions .
the criticism of the secret information on the Islamic State recall feu@@ ds of more than ten years ago , as a Cent@@ Com analy@@ st , Greg@@ ory Hoo@@ ker , wrote a piece about how the then government under George W. Bush cau@@ tioned only a small occupation force in Iraq and had little time to think about the consequences of the invasion of 2003 .
Mr. Hoo@@ ker also played a key role in revol@@ t against the current coverage of the Islamic State .
last year , the team headed by Mr. Hoo@@ ker stated that contrary to the government &apos;s statements against the refin@@ eries held by the Islamic State , there were no significant effects on the financial situation of the terrorist group , since these temporary refin@@ eries had put into operation in order to sell oil on the black market .
this recognition , however , was not published , reported the Times in September .
Cent@@ com@@ s dam@@ al commander , Doctor Lloyd J. Austin III , was critic@@ ised by members of the legislature on his over@@ ly positive assessment of the situation at a hearing before the Senate .
general Austin retired in April and was replaced at the Central Command by Gen@@ . Joseph L. V@@ otel .
the United States wins fourth match in women &apos;s field ho@@ ckey , a show@@ down with Britain is ahead
one day after having shot three goals during a 6 @-@ 1 victory over Japan , K@@ atie B@@ am also made the first two goals for the American field ho@@ ckey team of women in a match on Thursday against India that the Americans won 3 @-@ 0 .
five goals in two games should actually be a memorable achievement , but B@@ am ( 27 ) said she couldn &apos;t remember that ever done .
&quot; I have no idea . &quot; she said .
I am not among the people who keep their gates in memory .
but she knows : the Americans are at 4 @-@ 0 in the Olympic competition and are also in their group with the Brit@@ ons in the first place , which after their 2 @-@ 0 victory against Japan will remain un@@ defeated .
great Britain and the United States will meet on Saturday in the final game of the first round .
both teams have already qualified for the quarter final , the game will decide which of the two teams will win the first and second place within their group of six teams .
the first place will go slightly longer by the strong Dutch runners who lead the other group .
whatever the game takes place on Saturday , the Americans have triggered a surprising vor@@ tex through their success story , four years after they ended up at the last London Games on the last of 12 places .
BA@@ M was part of this team .
she grew up in Blue Bell , Pennsylvania , and had the first time with three years a ho@@ ckey club in her hands ( her two older sisters played the sport at Dre@@ xel University ) , with 16 years she became national player of the USA , the youngest in the history of the team .
she missed the Olympics in 2008 , as she could not qualify for the cad@@ re .
then came the year 2012 in which everything went wrong for her and her team .
during the following year Cra@@ ig Par@@ n@@ ham , an Engli@@ sh@@ man , became a trainer of the national team and started to turn things better .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a change of culture , mental change and a physical change , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said B@@ am . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we didn &apos;t have the work@@ load in London that we now have .
we have been able to pull the ru@@ dder completely around .
on Thursday evening B@@ am opened the door in the first half of the game with a back @-@ hand from the close @-@ up area .
India was going to play without victory in the tournament , but the team was surprisingly tough and kept the score from 1 @-@ 0 down to the third quarter until B@@ am took the game into her hands .
she carried out a spr@@ int with the flat ball over the left flan@@ k , then moved into the middle and le@@ aped the ball into the gate to give the Americans a 2 @-@ 0 guide .
Mel@@ issa Gon@@ z@@ al@@ ez made the final goal in the middle of the last quarter .
the Sh@@ ut@@ out was the first of the whole tournament for the US , Jack@@ ie Brig@@ gs , who had to record a gate in each of the previous games .
it has a run .
just like B@@ am .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are in a good position , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Par@@ n@@ ham , but how good will depend on the outcome of the next game on Saturday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the middle of the R@@ age of the Olympic Games , the zen of the trampoline
wherever you are , as late it is , it is the Olympic Games .
the events in Rio de Jan@@ eiro feel constant and inevitable , a fast relay race between competition and aspir@@ ation .
it is as if the olymp@@ ic torch itself is a burning staff , which is passed by the w@@ rist@@ band to the swi@@ mmer to the gymn@@ ast for tri@@ athletes .
you can &apos;t turn on the TV , read a newspaper or listen to your neighbour &apos;s conversation in the coffee shop without listening to Sim@@ one Bil@@ es , K@@ atie Le@@ cover@@ y or the fight between Michael P@@ helps and C@@ had le C@@ los .
and then there is Log@@ an Do@@ ol@@ ey .
Do@@ ol@@ ey , who for the first time at the Olympic Games and a female s@@ warm with dimples , could have been under these known names that were sent to Prime Time built by sponsors and feel @-@ good TV advertising , if he were a swi@@ mmer , gymn@@ ast or even fen@@ c@@ er .
but Do@@ ol@@ ey , 28 , from Lake Forest , California , fights for gold at Olympic tramp@@ ol@@ ines .
the Olympic flame does not illumin@@ ate any event .
further from the center , partly in the shadow are the sports that are not generally accepted : air gun shooting , arch@@ ery , bad@@ min@@ ton , ta@@ ek@@ won@@ do .
we will always have the breast @-@ swimming and may it reign for a long time .
but if I have modest arguments for my particular dar@@ ling , let me draw attention to the dis@@ crete charm of the trampoline .
although the trampoline has been an Olympic event since 2000 , when it had its debut in Sydney , the last 16 years have been so scar@@ c@@ ely perceived that many of them , I had surv@@ eyed , did not know that it is an Olympic sport at all .
this could also be regional ignorance .
although the USA sent athletes to competition , it has never won a medal in jumping on tramp@@ ol@@ ines and had had an ath@@ lete until 2012 who made it up to the final round .
the Chinese and the Russians are inclined to divide the prices for the men and the Chinese and the Canadian ones for the women .
D@@ ong D@@ ong from China and Ro@@ sie Mac@@ L@@ enn@@ an from Canada will defend their gold medal this year from London .
the trampoline has a certain out@@ sider charm , partly because it sounds suitable for the un@@ enligh@@ tened ear for a c@@ lown school as the one for the Olympic Games .
at this point I should admit that I am not an expert , but a devoted enthusi@@ ast .
it has humor@@ ous potential - the carto@@ on@@ ous trem@@ bling of his never @-@ ending impact - but also the Gra@@ zie of Turn@@ out and Scu@@ ba Diving , the two sports that essentially unite .
the word &quot; trampoline &quot; comes from the Spanish El Tramp@@ oline , which means as much as &quot; stepping stone . &quot;
emerging winners jump on a giant trampoline , shoot almost up to 30 feet in the air and need a number of falling movements ( turning , pi@@ ke and sal@@ tos ) before they land on the feet .
according to the official Olympi@@ ad , they will be assessed according to performance , degree of difficulty and &quot; flight time . &quot;
thirty @-@ two athletes from 17 countries , 16 men and 16 women , will compete in Rio .
the most common Olympic v@@ ector is straight ahead .
med@@ alli@@ sts have to go further , faster , up and down in their quest for gold , sometimes up to the finish , sometimes back and forth , up and down on the playground .
they do not only hunt the finish line or the starting wall , but also a further highlight in television transmission : the world or the Olympi@@ ap@@ ord .
the goal @-@ oriented pursuit is no@@ bel , ad@@ mira@@ ble , even fan@@ atic - and it is enough to even stir a viewer to tears .
but it is also what I feel fati@@ gu@@ ed when watching these games .
the trampoline offers a resp@@ ite .
the v@@ ector of the trampoline &apos;s jum@@ per is above .
a forward movement is not the goal .
he or she boun@@ ces off , seemingly wei@@ ght@@ less like an a@@ stron@@ aut , goes up , then down , then effort@@ lessly back up .
there is also a competition , of course not without difficulty , but during the exercise there is no hec@@ tic attack on the goal , no wol@@ ves into the distance , only the dre@@ amy , elegant lifting of time and gravity .
it is so Zen like the competition in the Olympic Games can only be .
the women &apos;s qualification and final rounds will take place on Friday afternoon , in streaming at 13.@@ 00 Eastern Time ; the men on Saturday also around 13.@@ 00 .
N@@ BC will radi@@ ate the final rounds as part of an afternoon block from 14.@@ 00 on both days .
in the midst of the Olympia Man@@ ia they promise a quiet , nice moment , one that is probably over@@ looked in the general tum@@ ult .
if the increase in consciousness can only be achieved by the fear and obj@@ ecti@@ fication of male athletes - as the male US @-@ Tur@@ ner proposed recently - according to the Wall Street Journal - then Mr. Do@@ ol@@ ey anticip@@ ates his new fan community .
&quot; one generation protests &quot; in Ethiopia , Long an ally of the US
violent protests in Ethiopia
prot@@ esters calling for political changes in Ethiopia met with the government &apos;s violent resistance .
witnesses say that during the clas@@ hes with the police , ump@@ teen prot@@ esters were killed during sho@@ ot@@ ings .
is Ethiopia just going to collapse ?
in the last ten years , it was one of the most stable countries in Africa , a solid ally of the West with a fast growing economy .
but in recent months , protests against the government sh@@ ook the country and expanded into more and more areas .
last week thousands of people ra@@ ged on the streets and demanded fundamental political changes .
according to human rights organisations , the government &apos;s response was ru@@ th@@ less .
witnesses gave up that police fired and killed tens of un@@ armed demonstr@@ ators .
in circulation videos about the protests , which are probably from the last or the beginning of this year , show how security people hit young people with sticks while they were forced to make a hand against a wall .
the head of the UN Human Rights Authority is now calling for a detailed investigation .
&quot; it has always been difficult to keep this country together and in the future it will become even more difficult , &quot; said Ras@@ hid Ab@@ di , the leader of the Horn of Africa of the International Cris@@ is Group , a research group .
Ethiopia is the most popul@@ ous country in Africa and its stability is estimated by the West .
American military and intelligence services work closely with the Ethiop@@ ians to fight terrorism across the region , especially in Somalia . only a few countries in Africa , if ever , receive so much Western help .
Ethiopia &apos;s economy expanded at a considerable pace .
its infrastructure has improved dras@@ tically - there is a new commu@@ ter train in the capital Ad@@ dis Ab@@ aba .
the roads are usually quiet , safe and clean .
even if Ethiopia was anything but a model for democracy - human rights organizations continued to supp@@ ress oppression by the government - the opposition in the country was restricted , with dissi@@ dents effectively sil@@ enced .
many were sent to exile or in prison , killed or driven to the des@@ erts of the desert .
but that could change .
&quot; if you supp@@ ress people and they have no other options except to protest , it breaks out , &quot; said Se@@ you@@ m Tes@@ home , a lecturer in Central Asia .
the whole youth protests .
a generation protests .
there are numerous complaints that cover everything from land use to stran@@ gl@@ ehold in relation to the power of the ruling coalition .
after a widely critici@@ zed election last year , the ruling party and its allies received the last seat of the opposition and now control 100 percent of the parliament .
at the same time , tension rises along the border with Er@@ it@@ rea ; a struggle for this jag@@ ged , controversial line demanded hundreds of lives in June .
analysts fear that separ@@ ati@@ sts like the O@@ rom@@ o Liber@@ ation Front or the National Liber@@ ation Front of the O@@ ga@@ den , which have been forced more or less in recent years , could use the turbul@@ ence and re@@ arm themselves .
several factors explain why feelings of bitter@@ ness explo@@ de after years of before H@@ ink@@ öch@@ el@@ ns below the surface .
the first seems to be harmless : smartphones .
only in recent years , very many Ethiop@@ ians have been able to communicate with the social media because cheaper smartphones have become more and more frequent and the internet services improved .
even if the government blocks access to Facebook and Twitter , which it does at regular intervals , especially in protests , many people can still communicate via internet pro@@ x@@ ies hiding where they are .
several young Ethiop@@ ians gave an indication that they gathered to protest .
the second factor is that there is more solidarity between the Oro@@ mos and Am@@ har@@ as , the two largest eth@@ ni@@ cities in Ethiopia .
the Oro@@ mos and Am@@ har@@ as are not natural enemies .
for e@@ ons the Am@@ har@@ as , who come from Ethiopia &apos;s predominantly Christian high@@ lands , prosp@@ ered in politics and economy , while they exploited the Oro@@ mos , of which many Muslims are and live in low@@ land areas .
but this too is changing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are here to coordinate under one umbrella , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mul@@ at@@ u Gem@@ ech@@ u , a leader of the Oro@@ mos . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the biggest protests took place in areas of Am@@ har@@ a and Oro@@ mos .
many Am@@ har@@ as and Oro@@ mos feel that Ethiopia is in@@ adequately dominated by members of the ethnic group of Tig@@ ray who account for about 6 percent of the population and are dominant in the military , intelligence services , trade and politics .
the third reason for the un@@ rest is the death of Mel@@ es Zen@@ awi .
Mr. Mel@@ es , a former rebel leader , was Ethiop@@ ian Prime Minister for 17 years until his death in a non @-@ publi@@ ci@@ zed disease in 2012 .
he was seen as a tac@@ tical genius , a man who could think of corners .
analysts say that he was particularly well vers@@ ed in perc@@ ei@@ ving early signs of dis@@ content and using special appoint@@ ees to process opponents and make them harmless .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the present regime lacks this fundamental skill , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mr Ab@@ di , a conflict analy@@ st . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ethiopia &apos;s new prime minister , H@@ ail@@ em@@ ari@@ am Des@@ al@@ eg@@ n , was chosen for relatively un@@ transparent reasons to take the position of Mr Mel@@ es .
unlike Mr Mel@@ es , who came from the Tig@@ ray region North Ethiop@@ ian , Mr. H@@ ail@@ em@@ ari@@ am from the South comes .
analysts say that he does not enjoy the confidence of the security services controlled by the Tig@@ ray .
many fear that the result will be more blood@@ shed .
the last time Ethiopia had experienced such a tur@@ mo@@ il in 2005 , after prot@@ esting thousands of elections , which , according to the statements of analysts , were apparently fed by the government and were then stolen .
during the subsequent ra@@ ids , many prot@@ esters were killed , even if they were less than in the last months and this time of tur@@ mo@@ il passed relatively quickly .
development experts praised Ethiopia &apos;s leaders for their vision@@ ary infrastructure planning , such as the new commu@@ ter train , as well as for their meas@@ urable progress in fighting poverty .
but obviously , this has not prevented the intensi@@ fication of the internal mis@@ use of the Ethiop@@ ian government .
and it adop@@ ts a dangerous ethnic form .
last month prot@@ esters in Gon@@ dar , an am@@ har@@ an city , attacked by Tig@@ ray and hatred towards the Tig@@ ray becomes more and more common in the social media .
analysts say that the protests bring the US and other Western allies into a peculiar position .
the American government used Ethiopia as the basis for D@@ ron@@ en@@ flights over the neighboring Somalia , even if it recently announced that it closed this base .
while the West wants to support democracy clearly , he doesn &apos;t want his ally to collapse in an already volati@@ le area .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this , &quot; said Mr Ab@@ di , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is a very thin ti@@ ght@@ rope walk . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

Donald J. Tr@@ ump tried to disp@@ el the last controversy surrounding his campaign by attacking his multiple repeated claim that President Obama and H@@ illary Clinton were the &quot; founders &quot; of the terrorist group Islamic State , not serious .
this clari@@ fication raises new questions on the communication skills of the Republi@@ cans &apos; presidential candidates , whether he is able to communicate clearly and easily with the American public .
it also brings his fellow comb@@ at@@ ants , who endeav@@ our to take care of him during an event@@ ful phase , in the peculiar position to declare his statements , which he could not have meant at all .
after having made the announcement at an election event on Wednesday evening , Mr. Tr@@ ump with@@ drew in terms of the alleg@@ ation on Thursday and insist@@ ed that he really did not intend to indicate that President and Mrs. Clinton had created IS@@ IS .
but in an early morning T@@ we@@ et on Friday Mr. Tr@@ ump said he was simply sar@@ c@@ astic .
the tweet was contrary to the previous day , on which Mr. Tr@@ ump said in a number of interviews , he said the accus@@ ation completely serious .
when the conservative Radi@@ om@@ or@@ ator Hu@@ gh He@@ wit@@ t wanted to help Mr. Tr@@ ump to we@@ aken the statement by remin@@ ding him that Mr. Obama wants to destroy IS@@ IS , the Republi@@ can presidential candidate did not want to know anything about it .
the last storm of criticism came down upon Mr. Tr@@ ump while he attempted to ste@@ er the focus of his campaign due to falling demand values on the economic situation .
Mr. Tr@@ ump and Mrs. Clinton talked about the economic situation in Mich@@ igan this week .
on Friday Mr. Tr@@ ump tried to return to this subject again .
talking about Twitter , he warned that Mrs. Clinton &apos;s suggestions would lead to higher taxes and that he found her speech boring .
Mr. Tr@@ ump has already brought sar@@ cas@@ m to his defense .
at the end of July he critic@@ ised himself when he said the Russians should h@@ ack Mr@@ s Clinton &apos;s emails , but later he explained &quot; Of course , I said the sar@@ c@@ astic . &quot;
this method allows Mr. Tr@@ ump to post@@ p@@ one the linguistic boundaries in politics and then back down as needed .
&quot; I think it &apos;s one of his methods to test how certain messages are received by his fans , how they arrive , and then &quot; clarify &quot; depending on how the reaction falls . &quot; said Ruth Sher@@ man , a communication expert who ob@@ serves the language of both candidates .
but I think he &apos;s clever enough to keep his statements vag@@ ue enough so that they can be interpreted in different ways .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; instead of def@@ using the tone for the presidential elections , Mr. Tr@@ ump has assumed an even more corro@@ sive sound , as his cargo values have gone further . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a new survey by N@@ BC / Wall Street Journal / Mar@@ ist , which was published on Friday , showed a lead with a great advantage in the states of North Carolina , Virginia , Colorado and a head @-@ to @-@ head @-@ race in Florida .
while Mr. Tr@@ ump generally tries to excuse himself for his pro@@ voc@@ ative statements , he often acc@@ uses his critics of distor@@ ting his statements or mis@@ understanding his hum@@ our .
but while he emphas@@ ises the focus of attention in the last months of his presidential campaign , Mr. Tr@@ um@@ ps Scher@@ ze has brought his loyal co @-@ workers into the uncomfortable situation to stand up to him regardless of how pro@@ voc@@ ally his statements may be .
Rudol@@ ph W. Giuli@@ ani , former mayor of New York and one of Tr@@ um@@ ps &apos;s most prominent advoc@@ ates , took great effort to defend the candidate from Thursday in a CN@@ N interview .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I believe what he says are legitimate , political comments &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mr. Giuli@@ ani if Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton had founded the Islamic State . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is true in this sense that before Obama IS@@ IS was an almost unknown , small organization , he called them back@@ stra@@ ws , completely wrong and therefore it happened because he removed the troops from Iraq .
most of the mainstream republi@@ can try to argue that under Obama , in which Mrs. Clinton served as Minister of Foreign Affairs , IS@@ IS allowed IS@@ IS to spread by taking control of the situation in the Middle East aggres@@ sively .
before the events in Pennsylvania on Friday , Mr. Tr@@ ump continued his attacks on the media and accused them of being on each of his words and being pre@@ ju@@ dic@@ ed against him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he mo@@ cked &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; poor , twi@@ light &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; television experts trying to understand and said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; You can &apos;t ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
some of the democr@@ ats mo@@ cked Mr. Tr@@ um@@ ps &apos;s ap@@ ology as a further proof that he was un@@ suitable for the pres@@ idency .
once driven over the price of the market , Café in Green@@ point returns
Ver@@ b Cafe was a big@@ oted café in Willi@@ am@@ sburg , where you could only pay cash that didn &apos;t have Wi @-@ Fi , but served a good coffee for 15 years .
of course , the prices from his Bed@@ ford Avenue store front were displaced .
soap Cher@@ ie &apos;s shop , which was sold in summer 2014 , sells soap in the form of cup@@ cakes .
local people smo@@ ked it as the last loss in a gent@@ ri@@ fying city .
the artist Mol@@ ly Cra@@ b@@ apple wrote on Twitter , &quot; I know , New York is change , but I still can &apos;t believe that CB@@ GB is dead , the Chelsea Hotel is apart and verb is now a soap business . &quot;
but if New York is change , then it is also new invention .
a re@@ vit@@ alized Ver@@ b Cafe opened last November in Green@@ point , less than a mile north of its original location .
the new verb has Wi @-@ Fi and accepts credit cards , but still has some of the same staff and a similarly simple atmosphere .
the coffee is still good .
the new owner of the club is Cisco Rodri@@ gu@@ ez , a long @-@ standing employee of the old café , the owner and managing director of the new café .
he started working in Ver@@ b in 2001 and remained there until the end .
when a customer offered to provide money for a new exterior , he was excited to do it , he said .
Rodri@@ gu@@ ez , 36 , kept many things .
Ver@@ b uses the same distributor for the bag@@ els bought the same espresso machine model .
it even uses the same lamps from the old verb .
but Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said he wanted to experiment .
he introduced new ingredients .
on the menu there are sand@@ wiches with bac@@ on and cheese and there are gar@@ nish tops like cap@@ ers and s@@ aut@@ é@@ ed onions .
there are natural rice dishes .
the café does not serve beer anymore , but there are fresh juices .
after nine months Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said he had noticed a steady stream of old regular customers .
&quot; many old customers were also displaced by prices from Willi@@ am@@ sburg , &quot; he said .
just on a Sunday , Rebecca Oli@@ v@@ eira was such a customer .
Oli@@ v@@ eira , 34 , lived earlier in Willi@@ am@@ sburg and visited the club regularly .
even after she moved to Green@@ point , she would take the way .
after the verb closed , she gave up the coffee for a while , she said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I realized that it was in the coffee and the culture in the verb that liked me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
now she drinks coffee again , even though she ordered a Bl@@ ended Cha@@ i Tea on that day instead of her usual iced coffee , which is another new addition .
Tom Ros@@ enthal has been a long@@ standing and loyal customer since the beginning of the club in 2003 .
he went there before the work and in@@ vari@@ ably ordered the same .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I came quarter after seven , every day , like a Swiss pocket watch and they prepare my Every@@ thing Ba@@ gel with butter , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
photo Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said he wanted to experiment and record new ingredients in the menu .
nowadays Ros@@ enthal still gets his usual order , but sometimes he changes his Every@@ thing @-@ Ba@@ gel with bac@@ on , egg and cheese .
Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said that he did not make a gru@@ dge about the fact that the soap @-@ shop occupied the old business area .
in fact , the owners of So@@ ap Cher@@ ie offered to produce a special soap for ver@@ b with the coffee of coffee in the café .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think we will still deal with it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Rodri@@ gu@@ ez . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and the traditional Polish inhabitants Green@@ points also accepted the café .
a new customer has translated the menu into Polish and Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said he has prepared to exhibit them soon , so that his new neighbors feel welcome .
the location has further advantages .
a local juice pub wants to fill and sell the cold coffee .
there is a chance that the café expands to a neighboring building .
a new verb suff@@ ices for many customers to get their old favour@@ ites .
Joseph W@@ itt was a regular customer and said that he was destroyed by the ground when the café closed .
when the new café opened , Wh@@ itt said that entering the restaurant and ordering felt a new coff@@ ees like a return home .
&quot; I had to smell it , &quot; he said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the de@@ pressing food of the economic crisis in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a rich meal &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in March 1933 , shortly after his ascension to the President , Fran@@ klin Del@@ ano Ro@@ os@@ ev@@ elt took his lunch at the O@@ val Office .
as a g@@ our@@ mets , President Ro@@ os@@ ev@@ elt had a fi@@ ai@@ ble for refined delicacies of Fi@@ fth Avenue like P@@ â@@ te de fo@@ ie gr@@ as and Mary@@ land Water@@ tur@@ tle Sou@@ p .
his menu on that day was a little more modest : stu@@ ffed eggs in tomato sauce , mas@@ hed potatoes and dessert a pl@@ um pu@@ dding .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was an act of culinary solidarity with suffering people , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Jane Ziegel@@ man . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; her husband Andrew Co@@ e added , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; It was also a message to the Americans how they should eat . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the couple lives in Brooklyn Heights and are both food histori@@ ans .
Co@@ es &apos;s latest book &quot; C@@ hop Su@@ ey &quot; was talking about Chinese cuisine in the US while brick in her book &quot; 97 Orch@@ ard &quot; tells about life in a house on the Lower East Side of the food perspective .
their latest collaboration , &quot; A decent meal , &quot; which will appear on Tuesday at the Har@@ per Publishing House , illustrates the history of American cuisine during the Great Depression .
they show culinary solidarity as they meet with a repor@@ ter at the Eisen@@ berg &apos;s Sand@@ wich Shop for dinner , a small , fri@@ lls in the Fl@@ ati@@ ron District , which has been in store since the stock market crash in 1929 .
brick , 54 , ordered a fresh cheese sandwich with olive pieces , while Co@@ e , 57 , tur@@ key with mas@@ hed potatoes and vegetable mix ate .
when the repor@@ ter ordered Hack@@ ney , this found the couple suitable for a discussion about the food in the era of great depression .
&quot; rich food products were very popular , &quot; said Ziegel@@ man .
there were pe@@ an@@ ut bread , liver cheese and bean bread .
they were prepared from an ingredient and a little cheaper that stretches the ingredient .
imagine eating so many pe@@ an@@ uts as they serve them as dinner .
co@@ E gr@@ inn@@ ed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it has to be placed in the stomach like lead , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the years before the Great Depression the table was in an American budget , especially in rural areas , an All @-@ You @-@ Can @-@ E@@ at @-@ Buffet .
teams of women cook for male fel@@ lows and it was served freshly baked p@@ ate for breakfast , lunch and dinner .
it was Americans who sent food to star@@ ving Europeans during the First World War . &quot; a Square Me@@ al &quot; traces the ways in which the country was going to be no longer the land of Cock@@ aig@@ ne .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was a time when the food for Americans became a pi@@ vot@@ al issue , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Co@@ e , why he and his wife wanted to write about it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the new budget@@ ed diet was just as ten@@ se : mysterious foods such as bre@@ ads and c@@ asser@@ ol@@ es were added to stap@@ le foods , the c@@ asser@@ ole was a &quot; wonderful way to recy@@ cle food lef@@ to@@ vers , &quot; because coo@@ ks could hide un@@ appeti@@ zing ingredients under a cre@@ amy sauce .
fresh fruit was replaced by cheaper dr@@ y@@ beans .
meat that was the central focus of the American kitchen for years became a rare luxury .
peculiar bl@@ ends have been tried out , as a calorie @-@ rich and nutri@@ tious gr@@ ati@@ fication took preced@@ ence over taste or even common sense .
while resear@@ ching the book , which also includes recipes , tile prepared a dish from that period , baked onions with pe@@ an@@ ut butter .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was not a popular addition at noon , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Co@@ e . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ziegel@@ man continues : &quot; it was sur@@ real . &quot;
pe@@ an@@ ut butter and fried onions do not fit together .
it was typical for many of the house@@ keeping recipes .
as never before or since then , budget econom@@ ists - including Lou@@ ise Stan@@ ley , head of the Federal Bureau of Home Economics from 1923 to 1943 - had such an approach to eating habits in the country .
by publishing recipes and articles in newspapers and magazines , they encouraged women to become &quot; household politicians &quot; and the challenge of turning pamp@@ h@@ lets such as cre@@ amy sp@@ agh@@ etti with car@@ rots into delicious meals .
&quot; a Square Me@@ al &quot; is a festival of historical delicacies .
in particular , the reports on the response of the government to the star@@ ving citizens , such as President Herbert Hoo@@ ver &apos;s L@@ ass @-@ me @-@ Cake food attitude .
while he publicly praised the simple I@@ owa peasant house kitchen of his kitchen , he fed like the million@@ fold man of the world he became .
&quot; he liked continental cuisine like fish with cu@@ cum@@ ber sauce , &quot; Co@@ e said .
he ate in an almost gil@@ ded dining room and took a tu@@ x@@ edo .
he was super@@ bly alien to reality .
President Ro@@ os@@ ev@@ elt might have made the same mistake if his wife Ele@@ an@@ or had called upon him to stamp an example with his stomach .
as described in the book , the present of a house@@ keeper with no interest in flavors by Mrs. Ro@@ os@@ ev@@ elt suggested that the White House produced the most boring food in Washington , but also one of the most comfor@@ ting ones . &quot;
many of the species from the era of Great Depression to deal with food was rejected as soon as the country returned to the legs .
the legacy is on our continuing focus on calories and food , said Ziegel@@ man , as well as how science was applied to foods .
in writing the book , the couple gave a better understanding of the eating habits of a mother @-@ in @-@ law , for example , how they could not throw food away .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she had a real fear of food waste , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Co@@ e . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he remembered : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she really made people ill . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there was the outbreak of the wind .
after the plates were ev@@ acu@@ ated at Eisen@@ berg &apos;s place , they and Co@@ e produced a dessert that they had prepared at home : the picking dessert , the president Ro@@ os@@ ev@@ elt ate at lunch .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is called Pr@@ une Whi@@ p , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ziegel@@ man said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was a common trick to miss a nice name . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there was no whi@@ pped cream , only pl@@ ums , some flour , sugar , water and cinnamon .
each di@@ ved somewhat reluc@@ t@@ antly a spoon in the t@@ amed , brown gli@@ b@@ ber .
amaz@@ ingly , it ta@@ sted not bad .
Co@@ E got three times a supplement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said to his wife , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A couple of chopped wal@@ nuts would help . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
killed in bombs attack : he was the hero of Ale@@ ppo
he put his own life on the game to help others : Khal@@ ed O@@ mar .
he was the hero of Ale@@ ppo : Khal@@ ed O@@ mar dedicated his life to the people of Syria .
he ris@@ ked everything to save others life .
now the 30 @-@ year @-@ old himself died during a barrel bomb attack by the Assad regime .
O@@ mar was a member of the White Helm@@ ets , a civil defence group who , according to the Bild @-@ Zeitung , saved nearly 6@@ 0,000 people alive .
29@@ 00 volunteers put their own lives on the game in order to pull people out of sh@@ attered homes and to provide first aid in the war zone .
they are the heroes of war in Syria .
O@@ mar was the face of the group : a video of the civil defence , which shows him during an 11 @-@ hour rescue of an acid from the rub@@ ble of a house , went around the world in 2014 .
it made the Syrians a shining icon in the horror of the war .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but he never saw himself as heroes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for me this is the genuine Ji@@ had . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when I die to save lives , I think God sees a mart@@ yr in me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
shortly before O@@ mar himself fell victim to an attack , he had spoken in a video about the last bom@@ b@@ ings in Syria .
the helicop@@ ters have dropped four barrel bombs on the Alz@@ adi@@ a District , one was filled with chlorine gas .
a woman and two children died , seven people suffer from short@@ ness of breath .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we now eliminate the po@@ ison@@ ous rem@@ n@@ ants of the bomb , so that children do not play with it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the picture quotes his final words before he died . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the deadly bomb of the Assad regime had to strike terrorists .
Greenland : the oldest verteb@@ ra@@ e is almost 400 years old
rare sight .
Greenland &apos;s hair@@ s usually come to the surface only in winter .
this shar@@ k was allowed to return to the sea after an investigation on board the research ship S@@ anna .
he was born in 16@@ 24 and flo@@ ats with a good 1 km / h through the North Atlantic - to this day .
Greenland &apos;s ha@@ i@@ ries only get up with 150 years of offspring .
lei@@ surely the Greenland @-@ shar@@ k flo@@ ats along the bottom of the North Atlantic , in an hour he arrives at an average just 1.@@ 220 meters .
only when it arrives on it acceler@@ ates the five @-@ meter @-@ long animal at a full 2,@@ 6 km / h - and is half as fast as a seal with this top speed .
this lifestyle characterized by slow@@ ness , however , seems to be a pan@@ ac@@ ea for a high age .
Julius N@@ iel@@ sen from the University of Copenhagen and his colleagues report in the journal &quot; Science &quot; at any rate from a Greenland hai who could be 3@@ 92 years old .
&quot; ma@@ dness , &quot; Alexander Sch@@ euer@@ lein , from the Max Planck Institute for Dem@@ ographic Research in Rostock , comments this life span , which means a world record for verteb@@ rates .
ad@@ mitt@@ edly , the evolution@@ bi@@ ologist suspected that Greenland &apos;s hair will be stone @-@ old .
only the evidence was lacking .
Greenland &apos;s sh@@ arks are hard to observe , finally they live mainly in the ice sea in front of the spar@@ sely populated coasts of Canada , Greenland , Norway and S@@ val@@ bard .
because they prefer water temperatures around the six degrees Celsius , they usually appear only in winter on the surface .
researchers know little about the li@@ fest@@ y@@ les of Greenland .
their slow @-@ motion @-@ motion measured it when they presented six animals with one transmitter in front of S@@ val@@ bard .
however , in the stomach of an animal , researchers found the remains of a seal , another had swal@@ lowed the jaw@@ bone of a young polar bear .
maybe they hunt sleeping animals or pat@@ rol on the bottom of the ice cream and seek cad@@ aver that tor@@ tured from higher water layers down .
Julius N@@ iel@@ sen and his colleagues investigated 28 Greenland Sh@@ arks , fishermen between 2010 and 2013 fet@@ ched from Greenland or S@@ val@@ bard as by@@ catch from the depths of the North Atlantic .
the smallest shar@@ k was just 81 centimet@@ res long , while the largest is 50@@ 2 centimet@@ ers .
to determine the age of the animals , the carbon @-@ 14 method analysed the lens nucle@@ us of the sh@@ arks .
this center of the eye lens is formed already before the birth of the sh@@ arks , the proteins contained in it will no longer be renewed .
the two smallest sh@@ arks had a remarkable amount of carbon @-@ 14 in the lens nucle@@ us .
their birth , therefore , was to lie after the early 1960s when nuclear dis@@ arm@@ ament attempts in@@ filtr@@ ated large amounts of this radioactive carbon into the atmosphere .
in the third smallest animal with a length of 220 centimet@@ res , the lens nucle@@ us contained a small surplus of carbon @-@ 14 from nuclear weapons tests , it is likely to have celebrated its 50@@ th birthday in its investigation in 2012 .
in their lens nucle@@ us all larger Greenland hair@@ s , on the other hand , had normal carbon @-@ 14 quantities produced by cosmic rays in the atmosphere .
in fact , the Carbon @-@ 14 clock for a 4@@ 93 cen@@ timeter long Greenland showed an age of 3@@ 35 years , while the record shar@@ k with 50@@ 2 centimet@@ ers might be 3@@ 92 years old .
that Greenland @-@ hai @-@ females only get offspring when they are longer than four meters , was known .
now the researchers were able to assign an age to the length .
since one of the animals with 3@@ 92 centimet@@ res was probably at the threshold for sexual maturity and its age was determined at 156 years , Greenland &apos;s hair with reproduction obviously let itself at least one and a half centuries of time .
this is also likely to be world record for verteb@@ rates .
it is not a coinci@@ dence that such methane waves live mainly in icy waters .
the previous record holder , a 211 year old Greenland w@@ ale , in whose bac@@ on at the neck was a 120 year old har@@ poon tip , was caught up in front of Alaska .
due to the low temperatures , the organism of the animals living there often runs on low @-@ fl@@ ames .
so they mature later - and age slower .
in order to keep warm in the cold water , the animals are often very large .
because the volume grows much faster than its surface by which the animal loses heat .
the heat loss of one gram of mouse is therefore much larger than with a gram of elephant .
another advantage : you have fewer enemies .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a smaller animal therefore lives more dangerous and should focus on having as many descendants as possible as possible , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; declares Sch@@ euer@@ lein &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a very big animal , on the other hand , should invest its resources rather in a long life .
building plot in double pack
in the recent session , the municipal council focuses on issues relating to building .
with relief , the Panel on Mayor Robert P@@ utz announced that &quot; finally , the marketing of the recently reported living areas can begin . &quot;
after clari@@ fying the plots of land , par@@ c@@ els and closures and the applications for surve@@ ying , the sale of land in the residential areas &quot; Stre@@ der@@ straße &quot; and &quot; Schön@@ au @-@ West &quot; ( section 1 ) is no longer available to interested parties .
the Municipal Council is convinced that the construction areas in the rural and quiet residential community Schön@@ au attract young families and former senior citizens alike .
as it was said , building volunteers can immediately report to the Town Hall , which is expected to provide advice on the awar@@ ding of the plots in September .
in order to be able to meet requests for the establishment of other commercial enterprises , connected with the creation of jobs , the municipal council decided to change the land use plan newly created in the spring of this year in sub @-@ sections .
in the area of Unter@@ zeit@@ lar@@ n , the area already wi@@ dened by two plots in the direction of state road 2@@ 112 is extended .
Frankfurt benefits from the Bre@@ x@@ it
consequently , the city on the Main has the best chances of attrac@@ ting jobs and companies from London in the competition with Paris , Dublin and Luxemburg .
&quot; it is very likely that Frankfurt benefits most from the Bre@@ x@@ it V@@ ot@@ um , &quot; says Michael Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ länder , Head of the Financial Markets and Real Estate Markets of the I@@ W .
after the Bre@@ x@@ it referendum , it is uncertain whether money stores will continue to operate from London from financial transactions across the EU .
for the so @-@ called EU passport , they have been granted approval in the UK .
they are using large US banks .
several banks have already announced to shift jobs .
the lobby association &quot; Frankfurt am Main Finance &quot; anticip@@ ates 10,000 new jobs on the Main within five years .
for Frankfurt , the I@@ W , the headquarters of the European Central Bank ( ECB ) , which combines responsibility for monetary policy and supervision of the largest banks in the Eurozone , and other important authorities such as the European Insurance Super@@ vision E@@ IO@@ PA and ES@@ R@@ B .
in Paris , the Organisation for Economic Co @-@ operation and Development ( OECD ) has its headquarters , but this is less significant for the financial sector than the ECB .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; proximity to the central bank is important for banks as they can communicate directly with supervision , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says I@@ W @-@ Professor Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ länder . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
while Luxembourg has a large fund industry , it does not cut itself off as well as Dublin when it comes to infrastructure .
thanks to the large airport , Frankfurt is much easier to reach .
the city also points to the easily available commercial properties .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Paris it is not so easy to find free high @-@ quality offices , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ länder . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the Seine , the rent for first @-@ class commercial real estate was 50 percent higher than the Main .
in addition , Frankfurt offers a higher quality of life than competition due to good medical care and infrastructure as well as less crime .
in a ranking of the Merc@@ er consulting firm , the city is ranked 7th , Luxembourg in No. 19 , Dublin on No. 33 and Paris in 3@@ 7th place .
even if quality of life is a matter of preference : &quot; with its already strong position as a financial hub for the European single market , Frankfurt could attract more banks and investors , &quot; said the I@@ W .
but despite Bre@@ x@@ it @-@ V@@ ot@@ um , London will remain the most important financial center in Europe , my economic researchers .
in London , according to figures from the Landes@@ bank Hel@@ aba , some 14@@ 4,000 people worked in the banking industry at the end of 2015 , in Frankfurt there were 6@@ 2,500 .
Gilead receives legal charges from the hepatitis C patent dispute with Mer@@ ck
a US District Ju@@ dge ruled that Gilead Sciences Inc is entitled to a refund of legal costs arising from the H@@ ep@@ ati@@ ts C legal dispute with the pharmaceutical company Mer@@ ck &amp; Co Inc .
in June , Gilead was freed from a compensation payment of $ 200 million for the violation of two patents of Mer@@ ck , which were related to the block@@ bu@@ ster drugs S@@ ov@@ al@@ di and Har@@ is@@ i of Gilead , after a U.S. judge uncovered a pattern of mis@@ conduct on the part of Mer@@ ck , including the Mein@@ bia and other non @-@ ethical actions .
in the case of a law@@ suit filed on Thursday , US District Ju@@ dge Beth Lab@@ son Fre@@ eman said that Gilead is entitled to grant the costs incurred during the defence of the case .
Mer@@ ck tries to align with Gilead that controls the market of a new generation of hepatitis C medications , which can heal more than 90 percent of the patients with liver disease .
the case goes back to 2013 when Gilead and Mer@@ ck compl@@ ained each other and claimed ownership of laboratory work , which was based on Sof@@ os@@ bu@@ vir , the active ingredient in the drugs of Gilead .
troops supported by the U.S. say that they have reg@@ ained full control over Man@@ o@@ j from the Islamic State
troops supported by the U.S. have reg@@ ained full control over the northern city of Man@@ o@@ j near the Turkish border after the last IS fighters in the city have left this , said a group spokes@@ man on Friday .
the Democratic Forces of Syria ( D@@ KS ) , on the move of the remaining group of fighters who have under@@ min@@ ed themselves within the city , are currently comb@@ ating the city .
they liber@@ ated over 2,000 civilians held by the fighters as ho@@ stages , shared Shar@@ fan Dar@@ wish of the Man@@ i Military Council Reu@@ ters , alli@@ ed with the D@@ KS .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the city is now under perfect control , but we just carry out clean @-@ up work , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he told Reu@@ ters . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; clin@@ tons deserve 10.@@ 75 million in 2015 and pay 3@@ 4.2 % federal taxes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
H@@ illary Clinton announced on Friday its tax return for 2015 , which gave rise to USD 10.@@ 75 million and an effective 3@@ 4.2 % tax rate for the democr@@ ats and their husband .
in 2015 , the Clinton Foundation donated $ 1 million for char@@ itable purposes , mainly to the Clinton Foundation ; former President Bill Clinton spent almost USD 5.3 million in Rede@@ mp@@ tor@@ ars ; the former Foreign Minister issued an income of USD 3 million from the publisher Simon &amp; Schu@@ ster for her book on her term of office in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs .
Clinton &apos;s candidate for vice @-@ pres@@ idency , Sen@@ ator Tim ka@@ ine from Virginia , has published his tax declarations of the last ten years along with his wife Anne Hol@@ ton .
they paid an effective federal VAT rate of 20.@@ 3 % in 2015 .
&quot; H@@ illary Clinton and Tim ka@@ ine continue to set standards in terms of financial transparency , &quot; said Clinton &apos;s campaign hel@@ per J@@ enni@@ fer Pal@@ mier@@ i in a statement .
in a stark contrast , Donald Tr@@ ump hi@@ des behind false statements and re@@ trac@@ ts in reference to his previous promises to publish his tax declarations .
it is common for U.S. presidential candidates to publish their tax declarations although they are not obliged to do so by law .
Tr@@ ump , a New York business@@ man , and his attor@@ neys have stated a tax audit by the tax authorities .
&quot; they are on the train , &quot; wrote Clin@@ tons campaign hel@@ pers Ian Sam@@ s on Twitter , with reference to the release of the Democrats candidate .
on Thursday Michael C@@ oh@@ en , Tr@@ um@@ ps Special Consul@@ tant , told CN@@ N that he would not allow Tr@@ ump to release anything before tax inspections are not complete .
Tr@@ um@@ ps critics , including the Republi@@ can presidential candidate of 2012 Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney , have already announced that his refusal to raise questions regarding wealth , his donations for char@@ itable organisations , his business alliance and various other connections , in particular with Russia .
Clinton has already over@@ thrown himself on the subject and posted a video on the Internet on Friday in which high @-@ ranking Republi@@ can Tr@@ ump asks him to publish his tax return .
on Thursday she spoke about the topic also during a speech on the economy in Mich@@ igan .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he refuses to do what every other presidential candidate has done in recent decades and publish his tax declarations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said to the crowd . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Poli@@ tico has reported that during the 1990s , Tr@@ ump has paid no or very little tax during the 1990s , and a business journalist in the New York Times quoted a number of tax lawyers and tax advis@@ ors on Friday that could still be the case .
federal taxes have become a topic in the election campaign .
Clinton supports a scheme named after the billi@@ on@@ aire and investor War@@ ren Buff@@ ett who would ensure that individuals who earn more than USD 1 million earn a tax rate of at least 30 % .
President Obama also supports the proposal .
during an election campaign for H@@ illary Clinton in O@@ ma@@ ha , Neb@@ ras@@ ka , Buff@@ ett called for Buff@@ ett , whose Ber@@ k@@ shire H@@ ath@@ away industrial con@@ glomer@@ ate has its seat here , Tr@@ ump to exchange their tax declarations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Buff@@ ett said he had also under@@ gone a tax check of the I@@ RS and I was afraid of the voters and not before the tax authorities . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Clinton &apos;s campaign has published a tax return until 2007 .
the Clin@@ tons , now living in Ch@@ app@@ aqu@@ a , New York , on average paid an effective federal tax rate of about 32 % between 2007 and 2014 and an effective combined tax rate of approximately 4@@ 0.5 % .
the tax return of the Clin@@ tons of 2015 showed that these only USD 100 of their income as wages , unlike most Americans .
their main investment was a cost @-@ effective index fund , from which the Clin@@ tons divi@@ den@@ ds and income from USD 10@@ 9@@ ,000 were tax@@ ed .

con@@ doms with Chi@@ li@@ pu@@ der , fire@@ works promote Tanz@@ anian eleph@@ ants protection
conserv@@ ation@@ ists in Tanzania use an un@@ orthodo@@ x way to prevent eleph@@ ants from walking in inhabited settlements - they throw con@@ doms on them that are filled with chill@@ i powder .
the method has proven to be effective and the Hon@@ ey@@ guide Foundation , which already had the idea for years , has intensified its promotion along with the U.S. natural protection by training volunteers in villages in northern Tanzania to use a non @-@ violent four @-@ step method to protect their homes and harvest without hur@@ ting animals .
prior to that , many sp@@ ears used to defend themselves .
Friday is world telep@@ hon@@ y day dedicated to animal protection .
&quot; since we have developed the ... Tool@@ kit , we could observe a change in their attitude within these communities , and they are much more confident that they can stop the eleph@@ ants from their fields without har@@ ming the elephant . &quot;
the first two steps include the light of the elephant with a torch and blowing into a horn .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if he is not deter@@ red , a so @-@ called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Chi@@ li@@ wol@@ ke &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is thrown . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
chill@@ i powder mixed with earth is packed together with a fire@@ work body in a con@@ dom , whose end is turned to the ignition cord .
when it is lit , the con@@ dom bur@@ sts with a b@@ ang and spreads fine dust to the air .
a hint quite usually already out to hunt the elephant .
one last option is a shi@@ mmer that shoots a fire@@ work fire@@ work in the air , causing a loud , bright explosion .
Stad@@ thalle resol@@ ves unanim@@ ously : no Ki@@ osk building at the St. Go@@ ar@@ er Rhein@@ u@@ fer
normally , the St. Go@@ ar@@ er investment projects of commercial traders use K@@ us@@ sh@@ and - especially the retail trade in the core city is significantly out@@ dated .
the City Council , however , unanim@@ ously rejected the application for the new construction of a sales car on the Rhine bank in the immediate vicinity of the Rhine Bal@@ cons currently under construction .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; basically we welcome new tra@@ des@@ people , but this ki@@ osk does not fit in an exposed location on the Rhine bank , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Michael Hu@@ br@@ ath for the CD@@ U faction . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Jewish director breaks Berlin &apos;s hotel , because Israeli pres@@ election was removed after &quot; Arab &quot; demand - RT News
a French director with Jewish roots released a media insurrection after he had betra@@ yed that the Kemp@@ inski B@@ rist@@ ol Hotel in Berlin did not list Israel &apos;s pre @-@ election as there were Arab guests according to an employee . &quot;
Claude Lanz@@ mann , author of the Holocaust documentation &quot; Sho@@ ah &quot; made his anger at the Kemp@@ inski B@@ rist@@ ol Hotel in Berlin , writing an open letter to the German newspaper FA@@ Z .
during his last stay , Lanz@@ mann tried to find Israel on the country &apos;s country selection list .
however , the country was not listed among the countries that can be called directly from the hotel room .
how is it possible in 2016 in Berlin , the capital of the new Germany , that Israel was eliminated and extingu@@ ished ?
wrote Lanz@@ mann .
instead , the Kemp@@ in@@ ks@@ i B@@ rist@@ ol offers a possibility to choose Israel via their own call center .
looking for an explanation , the director turned to the hotel reception .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the answer he received there &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; shocked him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as Lanz@@ mann wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the hotel staff said that the measure was a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; deliber@@ ate decision of management of the Kemp@@ inski hotels . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the reason behind it triggered even more fur@@ y in the director .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; most of our guests are Arabs and they have demanded that the pre @-@ election is deleted , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the employee of Lanz@@ mann cited . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Israeli ambassador to Germany Y@@ ak@@ ov Ha@@ das @-@ Handels@@ man called this a &quot; big dis@@ grace , &quot; reports the Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung .
we were horri@@ fied and shocked by this event .
this is really sham@@ eful .
the fact that this has happened in Germany in exactly this hotel chain is even an even greater shame .
this does not require explanation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we expect the hotel to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; draw the right conclusions &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said the minister . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the incident triggered a quite large resonance on the Internet , where people called it a sc@@ andal .
some subordin@@ ated to the Kemp@@ inski Hotel that it had given the alleged promp@@ ts for Arab guests . &quot;
&quot; ashamed , &quot; he said in another article , in which it was pointed out that the hotel , which is located on the noble Kur@@ für@@ st@@ end@@ amm , is close to a synagogue .
the hotel quickly referred to all alleg@@ ations and called the incident a &quot; mistake &quot; and &quot; ap@@ ologi@@ zed &quot; by Lanz@@ mann , The Mir@@ ror told .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there was never a direct order , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Don &apos;t enter the quick election list , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung a spokes@@ man for the Kemp@@ inski Hotel . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it adds that the country code has now been added .
police put tear gas and rubber bul@@ lets against prot@@ esting Brazilian students
students met with the police on Thursday in Sao Paulo , Brazil , when they gathered to protest against the government &apos;s reforms for the public education system .
police put tear gas and rubber bul@@ lets against the demonstr@@ ators .
the difficulties began when police officers tried to disper@@ se the students , which led the police to use rubber bul@@ lets and tear gas .
several hundred students participated in the demonstrations to express their const@@ ern@@ ation on plans .
according to the Gover@@ nor of the Federal State of Sao Paulo Ger@@ al@@ do Al@@ ck@@ min , a little less than 100 public schools will be closed while 300@@ ,000 students will be implemented to save money .
some of the protest participants could see gra@@ ff@@ iti on the provisional president Michel Tem@@ er on walls .
the recent protests took place a few days after demonstr@@ ators went to the streets to support the suspended President Dil@@ ma Rous@@ se@@ ff , who had been removed from office by a vote of the Senate .
trade between Russia &amp; Iran suddenly rises to 71 % - RT Business
with the lifting of sanctions , according to the Russian ambassador in Iran , Lev@@ an D@@ zh@@ ag@@ ar@@ yan , the trade turnover between Moscow and T@@ eher@@ an grew by 7@@ 0.@@ 9 percent .
since the international sanctions against Iran have been lifted , interest in the part of Russian companies on businesses in the country has increased strongly , the ambassador announced .
Russian companies have existing connections with Iran , while new companies are ready to access the market .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course , further commercial expansion is one of the main priorities of bilateral cooperation with Iran , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said D@@ zh@@ ag@@ ar@@ yan . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he noted that the trading turnover between Russia and Iran in the first five months of 2016 increased by 7@@ 0.@@ 9 percent compared to the same period in 2015 and was $ 8@@ 56 million .
in particular , Russian imports in Iran increased by 9@@ 1.5 percent and amounted to $ 6@@ 97 million .
Russian imports from Iran rose by 16 percent to $ 158 million .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the trade down@@ turn was achieved by deliveries of machinery , agricultural vehicles and weapons , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the ambassador . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this year , D@@ zh@@ ag@@ ar@@ yan goes from a record number of Iranian tourists in Russia .
last year , the Russian agency abroad issued approximately 35@@ ,000 Vis@@ as , primarily travel visa , to Iranian citizens .
in addition , Iran reached the top 20 of the countries concerned with the number of tourists in Russia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it could be said that the record numbers of Iranian tourists in Russia last year , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the same time , only relatively few Russians visit Iran , something that the ambassador hopes that it will change .
&quot; I personally can recommend visiting the cities of Is@@ f@@ ah@@ an , Shi@@ ra@@ z and Y@@ az@@ d who have received monuments of the ancient Persian civilization in good condition , &quot; he said .
looking for witnesses : drow@@ ning the beverage market in Wald@@ br@@ öl
a rob@@ ber@@ y of prey has been practi@@ sed on Thursday evening on the drinks market of Re@@ we XXL at the Wald@@ br@@ ö@@ ler Ger@@ ber@@ straße .
under the support of a fire@@ arm three dark @-@ dressed people , who had m@@ um@@ med their faces , demanded the release of cash from the employee of the beverage market and then fled first on foot and then presumably with a silver @-@ colored VW Golf .
how much money has been captured doesn &apos;t tell the police .
the perpet@@ rators should have been between 1.@@ 60 and 1.@@ 70 meters in size , thus relatively small .
the drinks market is directly accessible from the parking deck of the Re@@ we market and is poorly visible .
the perpet@@ rators must be scre@@ ened in the direction of Ger@@ ber@@ straße , Friedrich @-@ Engel@@ bert @-@ Weg and , from the gravel car park located opposite the car park entrance , could be escaped with the silver @-@ coloured car , possibly towards B 256 ( Schla@@ der@@ n@@ ring ) .
who made observations at the time of the crime ( at 19.@@ 45 p.m. ) , which are in connection with the rob@@ ber@@ y case , should urgently report to the police .

Ha@@ ig@@ er@@ loch : pilgri@@ m to the gate of mercy
the young people from the pastoral care unit E@@ yach@@ tal @-@ Ha@@ ig@@ er@@ loch , St. Anna , were on the road for a four @-@ day pilgrimage from Vil@@ lingen to Freiburg .
four stages were tackl@@ ed together .
in order to bridge the time up to the next morning pilgrimage of all the young regi@@ stran@@ ts in the next two years , the senior ministry round St. Anna decided to prepare and carry out a long @-@ day pilgri@@ m journey .
various pilgrimage destinations have been tested and it was decided finally for the Freiburg Epis@@ cop@@ al Center , where this year , on the occasion of the Holy Year of Mer@@ cy , a special pilgrimage destination was offered for the Holy Year of Mer@@ cy at Freiburg &apos;s Mu@@ enster .

Scot@@ s@@ man Call@@ um Sk@@ inner storms home when Br@@ ite Gold wins for cycling
Scotland &apos;s Call@@ um Sk@@ inner ra@@ zed last night in the men &apos;s team @-@ Sprint in the Vel@@ od@@ rom in Rio to fame when the British team defended the London 2012 title .
the 23 @-@ year @-@ old from Glasgow took the anchor roll , which his comp@@ atri@@ ot Sir Chris Ho@@ y made himself to E@@ igen . he was proud of the legend when he stor@@ med home in order to win a victory from the favour@@ ites of New Zealand .
Britain claimed a sho@@ cking victory four years ago while Ho@@ y won the fifth of six Olympic med@@ als .
they repeated the trick after finishing in March at the London Under@@ ground World Championships in spite of Ho@@ ys &apos;s withdrawal only a modest sixth place .
the problem between Beijing and London was the replacement of the An@@ fahr@@ ers Jamie staff .
they did this in good time as a Hin@@ du .
his retirement created a gap , the Ki@@ an E@@ ma@@ di and Matt Cra@@ mp@@ ton tried to close .
Sk@@ inner was the man in whom they remained , when they saw potential in the Scot@@ s@@ man , which has now un@@ folded .
Hin@@ du , Kenn@@ y - who four years ago with Ho@@ y won - and Sk@@ inner rounded the qualification round a Olympi@@ ap@@ ord , but in the standard rounds the New Ze@@ al@@ anders won in the first round .
and the British trio won the du@@ el with gold .
after his lap he fell short , but Kenn@@ y brought the team forward and Sk@@ inner kept it .
a change of strategy made a major part of the transformation , while Hin@@ du went in a higher gear to slow it down and allow Kenn@@ y and especially Sk@@ inner to keep pace .
Ho@@ y looked from his position as BBC expert and dropped Sk@@ inner , Kenn@@ y and Hin@@ du , when they climbed to the podium .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the 23 @-@ year @-@ old Sk@@ inner from Glasgow said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a fl@@ attering comparison . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I &apos;m just here to do my best and make a name for myself .
in the final round we set up an Olympic ch@@ ord and defeated the world champion .
it was just incredible .
there is no better way to win this .
after the triumph in 2012 on the side of Kenn@@ ys and Ho@@ ys , Hin@@ du admitted that after a weak start he deliberately fell on the track .
he with@@ drew this statement later and there was no appeal of England &apos;s rival .
with such an outstanding victory this time there was no such problem .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hin@@ du said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it feels with all the GB flags on the platform like London . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we have come together as a team in the last three months .
we have so badly hit so many world titles that it was unbelievable to win again at the Olympi@@ ad .
this is an event , a gold medal for the nation winning seven of 10 titles in both Beijing and London .
if that is a bar@@ ometer of our progress over the past five months , we expect successful five days in the Vel@@ od@@ rom .
with the form Kenn@@ ys it is in the field of possibility that he repeated Ho@@ ys &apos;s victory of three Olympic gold med@@ als in a competition .
that would be for Kenn@@ y - who was exactly 12 years younger than Ho@@ y , who was also born on March 23 ( a seemingly holy date for British sports ; on that day Steve Red@@ grave , Mo Far@@ ah and Roger Ban@@ ni@@ ster were born ) - a yield of six gold med@@ als and a silver medal .
that would be the same for Ho@@ y .
Kenn@@ y is next in the spr@@ int that starts today and will go over three days .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the 28 @-@ year @-@ old from Bol@@ ton said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I enjoy this only for the moment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the team event is always the best .
you can win it with his colleagues .
it feels a bit lonely to win alone .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; If he wins two more gold med@@ als , he should be beaten to the k@@ night . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

Sir Brad W@@ ig@@ gins , Ed C@@ lan@@ cy , Steven Bur@@ ke and O@@ wa@@ in Dou@@ ll qualified with the fastest performance in four @-@ four @-@ kilomet@@ re races .
they arrived at the destination in 3 : 5@@ 1,@@ 9@@ 42 .

the GB team relies on his strong train team to dominate the middle period of the Olympic Games and to bring a crowd of med@@ als .
after a truly exceptional portra@@ yal of absolute domin@@ ance in Beijing and London , the expectations for Rio were shut down .
Dra@@ mas played in the background , so the res@@ ignation of Sh@@ ane S@@ ut@@ ton technical director in April was in the midst of sex@@ ism and bul@@ b@@ bing repro@@ aches , as well as the retirement of sizes such as Ho@@ y and Victoria Pend@@ let@@ on .
however , if you look at the first evening of the competition in the Vel@@ od@@ rom , it looks like the legendary reputation of G@@ Bs , which has reached its peak at the perfect moment , will be repeated again .
the future of the melting plant of Port@@ land as a result of the lifting of the energy contract
the future of the aluminium mel@@ tdown of Port@@ land in Victoria - as well as hundreds of work@@ places by workers - stand in the game as the system operator termin@@ ates the energy supply contract and thus aboli@@ sh@@ es all supply contracts , as the supplying energy company announced .
this move was followed by the government &apos;s decision in Victoria at the beginning of this year , not to grant any further subsidies for the operation of the plant .
a subsi@@ dy for 20 years will exp@@ ire in November .
up to 2000 jobs at the Al@@ coa plant in Port@@ land are at stake .
no less than 2000 work@@ stations - direct and indirect - could be at risk of closure .
in addition , it could come to dom@@ ino effects as the melt consum@@ es around 10 percent of the total electricity output of Victori@@ as .
in 2014 Al@@ coa closed the Point Henry Schmel@@ ing , which led to a closure of the Angl@@ es@@ ea power plant last year .
the melting of Al@@ coa in Port@@ land loses money and risks closure .
this step follows the years of spec@@ ulation in terms of the future of the plant , originally as a result of the strong Australian dollar and last because of the electricity price for the plant .
AG@@ L , which supplies the large aluminium melting plant with its Lo@@ y Y@@ ang A power plant in Lat@@ robe Valley , announced that three other owners are expected to termin@@ ate their contracts .
the plant is in the majority ownership of a joint venture between Al@@ coa and Al@@ um@@ ina , of which the Chinese company C@@ IT@@ IC and the Japanese Mar@@ u@@ ben@@ i Cor@@ p hold smaller portions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; AG@@ L expects that the plant will continue to operate in Port@@ land , which means further physical demand for electricity by sm@@ el@@ ting , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the company . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; AG@@ L further said that the contracts were called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hed@@ ging transactions &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which should come into force from November 2016 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
contracts have a 12 month period of notice , so that they will end 2017 .
&quot; hence , AG@@ L assumes that the contracts in the financial year 17 will contribute to revenues , &quot; said the current supplier .
all potential impact on earnings on AG@@ L from the G@@ J 18 is currently limited by forecasts of strong fut@@ ures markets for wholesale prices .
AG@@ L shared with the fact that the value of the contracts was already written in its annual closing in the amount of $ 18@@ 7 million in &quot; anticip@@ ation of a termination . &quot;
Al@@ coa said that the decision to book the Tre@@ aties was the &quot; Ab@@ ility of Al@@ co@@ as ... to operate the melt or to guarantee the power supply to the melt . &quot;
the US company said that it concluded a 20 year contract with Lo@@ y Y@@ ang in 2010 , which should have entered into force from November this year even if it is still a statement guilty of why it has withdrawn from the contract .
due to the poor economic conditions of the industry , analysts warn of the possible closure of the Port@@ land melt in Victoria and the Tom@@ ago plant near New@@ castle .
in reference to the analysts &apos; statements at the beginning of the week , the Head of Operations Stephen Mik@@ kel@@ sen said that Port@@ land annually consume around 600 MW and Tom@@ ago about 900 meg@@ a@@ watts of electricity .
should both systems disappear from the market , this would mean a significant reduction in demand on the &#91; electricity market &#93; .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and for us as a generator that wouldn &apos;t be good , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
more than just a das@@ h of reality TV @-@ star , K@@ end@@ all is on the cover of the September edition of Vo@@ gue
K@@ end@@ all J@@ en@@ ner , 20 , Model and fourth daughter of the manager and mother of the Kar@@ d@@ hi@@ an @-@ J@@ en@@ ner C@@ lans Kris is on the cover of the cov@@ eted September edition of the US Vo@@ gue .
K@@ end@@ all , the brand ambassador of Est@@ ee Lau@@ der and ran on Fashion We@@ eks in Milan , Paris and New York , announced on Thursday the news on their Inst@@ agra@@ m account .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a room full of people I love , the sight of this verse made me cry , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; K@@ end@@ all wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the cover of the cover followed a bizarre ( or just keeping Up with the Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ ans similar ? ) , common reality video showing the whole Car@@ das@@ hi@@ an @-@ J@@ en@@ ner family ( with the exception of the problem cases Ro@@ b and Ca@@ it@@ ly@@ n as well as in the presence of the most popular show@@ bi@@ z @-@ unc@@ le and producer of Ke@@ eping Up Ry@@ an Se@@ ac@@ Rest ) , which ends with a classic turn : they all planned a surprise party .
this represents the c@@ lich@@ é action nearly every birthday sep@@ tic of a child &apos;s return ( Se@@ ac@@ rest brought the sentence , &quot; You thought we had forgotten you ? &quot; ) , with the hon@@ esty of a cartoon on a slot at 8 o &apos;clock in the morning ) , but Kris had to let her other girls take part in this publicity .
with regard to the September edition of Vo@@ gue , a new era of car@@ dan has certainly begun .
K@@ end@@ alls &apos;s big sister Kim likes her , as for the Vo@@ gue cover ( she and her husband K@@ any@@ e West were on it in April 2014 ) , but the cover of the September edition of the magazine is a league for itself .
the September edition is the most popular edition of the year for Vo@@ gue .
with a circum@@ ference that is more similar to an illustrated book than a fashion magazine , the issue draws a large number of adverti@@ sers ( Accor@@ ding to Fas@@ hi@@ on@@ ist@@ a were about 8@@ 32 pages of the em@@ bank@@ ment 6@@ 15 pages advertising ) .
the revelation of his cover stars is eag@@ erly awa@@ ited that in the last two years pictures of the magazine le@@ aked before the official announcement .
women who were already on the cover include Na@@ omi Camp@@ bell , Linda Evangel@@ ist@@ a and K@@ ate Mos@@ s .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in recent years there have been more &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; celeb@@ ri@@ ties , the fashion &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; models that are celeb@@ ri@@ ties &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the cover . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Oscar winner and Di@@ or brand ambassador J@@ enni@@ fer La@@ wr@@ ence was in 2013 on the cover , a year after Lady G@@ aga had the honor .
but even with the small chance that Mrs. J@@ en@@ ner - who is described by the magazine as the &quot; breakthrough model &quot; of her generation - falls under the previous category , she is in good company .
these celeb@@ ri@@ ties are not related to famous people or reality stars or young@@ sters of today who know how to turn a good Snap@@ chat video ( even though everything is applicable to J@@ en@@ ner ) .
they are truly talented women who stand out in the entertainment industry .
Be@@ y@@ once , who appeared on the last cover , had one of the most successful years of her career with the publication of Lem@@ on@@ ade .
of course , J@@ enn@@ er &apos;s success does not appeal to everyone .
with her reality TV story J@@ enn@@ er &apos;s position in the world of fashion was always something ten@@ se .
in June , the former Victoria &apos;s Secret model Stephan@@ ie Se@@ ym@@ our J@@ en@@ ner and her colleague Gig@@ i Ha@@ did critici@@ zed them and called them &quot; Mist@@ akes of the Moment . &quot;
these feelings che@@ ered up again when the message came out with the appearance J@@ enn@@ er on the Vo@@ gue cover .
but walking around on the Mis@@ sm@@ ut seems to pass by the point .
K@@ end@@ all J@@ en@@ ner is on the cover of the September edition of Vo@@ gue .
it is a super@@ model in the tru@@ est sense of the word .
she runs for Marc Jac@@ obs .
it makes advertising for your pri@@ mer of Est@@ ee Lau@@ der .
she and all her sisters sell pictures of herself on their respective pay@@ wall apps .
she sells her made pictures of Cin@@ dy Cra@@ w@@ ford &apos;s daughter to the magazine LOVE .
and in her free time she is in reality TV . probably only to see her sister K@@ our@@ t@@ ney and her children .
centres of community centre every year 16@@ 0,000 people
more than 16@@ 0,000 of the country &apos;s auxiliary units are reported annually by the municipal centres , while the industry is preparing for the impact of further short@@ cuts to already over@@ loaded transactions .
in Que@@ ens@@ land , three out of five people - mostly elderly , immigrants , needy workers , victims of violence and those who have no means of un@@ just del@@ o@@ gi@@ ances and similar - are rejected in their search for free legal advice and legal assistance .
legal services of the municipality , which are already over@@ ly utili@@ sed , are ready for further cuts .
as of June next year , these legal centres will lose another 30 percent of their federal funds .
the Director of the Regional Centr@@ es of Que@@ bec James Far@@ rel@@ l said that the last survey of the National Association of Community Centers indicates that thousands of people have already been rejected each year .
Far@@ rel@@ l said that the situation would only be worse without the federal government &apos;s resolution .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Que@@ ens@@ land &apos;s community centers are chron@@ ically under@@ financed , which means that thousands of people are rejected by important services you need , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
people who leave violent relationships , people with un@@ man@@ a@@ geable and oppres@@ sive debts , families going through separ@@ ations , workers who have been dismissed un@@ ju@@ stly - all these people have problems of legal nature and this survey shows that they can &apos;t get the help they need .
the federal government will cut the funding by 30 percent from June 2017 , which means that thousands of needy people from Que@@ ens@@ land will be forced to cope with their legal problems without any help .
we urge the German At@@ tor@@ ney General and Federal Office of Justice and Sen@@ ators from Que@@ ens@@ land George Bran@@ dis to delay these short@@ cuts immediately so that people can receive the help they need in case of legal problems .
last year , the state government fulfilled its commitment to raise funds for guidance on the national average .
it is now time to look at the needs of the community centers and their communities , and that the government of Pal@@ as@@ z@@ c@@ zu@@ k inv@@ ests in this important work .
Donald Tr@@ ump Choice Camp@@ aig@@ n indic@@ ted after employees allegedly drew weapon
new York : Donald Tr@@ um@@ ps Camp@@ aig@@ n was indic@@ ted for alleged in@@ action after telling that their campaign leader for North Carolina put a fire@@ arm on one employee in February , while they were in a je@@ ep in February .
the incident was described in an indictment filed on Wednesday in Charlotte by Vincent B@@ ordin@@ i , a former software programmer for the campaign in this state .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; B@@ ordin@@ i announced to have waited for months that the matter would be settled internally before he realized that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that would not happen . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the campaign leader , Earl Philip , &quot; drew a gun , put his right index finger on the trigger , and ra@@ mm@@ ed the barrel in Vinc@@ ents kne@@ ec@@ eh@@ le , &quot; B@@ ordin@@ i stated in his indictment .
after he compl@@ ained to the local and regional campaign leadership , B@@ ordin@@ i stated that at least four more people had the same experience with Phil@@ lip , he was charged with the indictment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; weapons must not be fired to cause harm , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; B@@ ordin@@ i announced . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the accus@@ ation comes only two days after the Republi@@ can presidential candidate dis@@ b@@ anded a tur@@ mo@@ il when he told a crowd in North Carolina that the &quot; Second A@@ mend@@ ment People &quot; - fire@@ arm owners and arms fans - should take action if his rival H@@ illary Clinton should be elected and judges .
Tr@@ um@@ ps campaign made it clear that the media had torn his words out of the context and that he would not viol@@ ate violence .
B@@ ordin@@ is complaint demands compensation from the campaign for breach of due di@@ ligence and Philip for bodily injury and lasting emotional damage .
Tr@@ um@@ ps press spokesperson on Hope Hi@@ cks failed to reach an opinion .
attempts to contact Philip did not beat too .
W@@ C@@ CB , a local news channel in Charlotte , reports that Phil@@ lip is no longer employee of the campaign .
responding to calls to his consulting firm , Innov@@ ative Consulting Services , has not been re@@ acted .

Berlin / Schwer@@ in : survey before country elections : SPD and CD@@ U lose
in the upcoming elections in the federal states of Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern ( 4 September ) and Berlin ( September 18 ) considerable losses are recorded for the government party SPD and CD@@ U .
this resulted in representative surveys of the opinion research institute In@@ sa for the &quot; Bild &quot; newspaper ( Friday ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; while the red @-@ black government coalition in the North could scar@@ c@@ ely go@@ vern , this is not possible after the survey values in Berlin . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in both states , the SPD would be the strongest party and would have a good chance of continuing to head the head of government .
in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern , the SPD fell from 3@@ 5.@@ 6 percent to 24 percent five years ago .
according to the survey , the party only s@@ miles ahead of the CD@@ U , which could rise to 23 per cent again .
the third place is disputed between the left and the Af@@ D .
the left would come to 19 percent ( 18.@@ 4 percent earlier ) , the Af@@ D would be represented by 19 percent for the first time in the parliament .
despite a slight losses of 6 per cent ( previously 8.@@ 7 percent ) , the Green Party again hes@@ itated into the Schwer@@ in Land@@ tag .
N@@ PD and F@@ DP were not represented at the Land@@ tag with 3 per cent respectively .
according to the survey in Berlin , the SPD , according to the survey , only came to 23 per cent ( election 2011 : 28.@@ 3 percent ) .
the CD@@ U reached only 18 percent after 23.@@ 4 percent .
in this way , it still stands behind the green with 19 percent ( 2011 : 17.@@ 6 percent ) , but before the left at 15 percent ( previously 11.@@ 7 percent ) .
the Af@@ D would be represented at the Chamber of Dep@@ u@@ ties with 14 percent for the first time .
with 5 per cent , the F@@ DP could hope for a return , while the pir@@ ates would not miss the entry in contrast to 2011 .
Nokia 9000 Communic@@ ator : the first smartphone
e @-@ Mail and Internet in slow motion : 20 years ago Nokia communic@@ ator joined the market .
the success@@ ors dominate the world today - his maker experienced disaster .
the unit weigh@@ ed almost half a kilogram and was more than four times as heavy as an iPhone 5 .
it was thicker and bigger , so it wasn &apos;t well in the hand either .
on the contrary , it was pretty cl@@ ums@@ y .
the built @-@ in memory was initially eight meg@@ ab@@ ytes , which would be enough for about two sel@@ fies with high resolution .
an iPhone is now delivered with at least 16 gigab@@ ytes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Nokia 9000 Communic@@ ator &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; came into business 20 years ago , on 15 August 1996 , and it was the first smartphone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for a few Euro lovers can buy the devices on the internet , but they somehow come from the stone age of the internet age .
20 years ago , however , the communic@@ ator was a sensation .
the Finnish mobile phone maker announced the product a few months earlier at the C@@ eb@@ it computer fair in Hanover as an &quot; Western pocket format office . &quot;
in fact , the new mobile phone could receive a lot for then standards : SMS and e @-@ mails could be sent and received , even via fax was the communic@@ ator .
even access to web pages was possible via HTML browser , al@@ beit cru@@ el@@ ly slow .
a calcul@@ ator was available , a digital address book and an electronic calendar .
there was a small antenna and the mobile phone could be folded like a laptop .
then there was a small keyboard and a black and white screen .
quite proud the price was : 27@@ 00 D @-@ Mark , so about 1400 Euros .
the average retail price of a smartphone in Germany was 3@@ 92 euros in 2015 .
no one could suspect in August 1996 that the communic@@ ator would become the beginning of the smartphone era .
since then everything is different .
smart phones are a success story though not for Nokia .
the mobile division of the Finn@@ s experienced an un@@ exam@@ pled disaster , was finally sold to Microsoft and handled .
today , the market is ruled by suppliers who came much later than Nokia .
being online always and everywhere today is a lot of everyday life for a lot of people .
in 2015 , there were nearly two billion smartphone users around the world .
about 1.4 billion units were sold , Samsung and Apple alone account for 5@@ 55 million units .
worldwide sales with the devices are around 400 billion euros .
this includes the well @-@ running businesses of the countless app providers and telecommunications companies .
a whole industry has now emerged around the smartphone .
the decisive breakthrough on the mass market came only at the beginning of 2007 , then Apple CEO Steve Jobs on Mac @-@ World announced the introduction of the iPhone .
he promised three devices in one : a music player , a telephone and an internet communic@@ ator , everything via touch screen is easy to use .
Apple &apos;s trium@@ ph@@ al procession began , and today the iPhone is the most important product of the Group .
Nokia , Motor@@ ola and Black@@ berry , who dominated the market , had the look .
she finally disappeared , Black@@ berry has to fight .
the sa@@ wing now has Apple and Asian vendors like Samsung .
the smartphone is a matter of course for 20 years after its invention .
on average , every German now looks at his mobile phone 88 times a day .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we all have to learn to get the smartphone even away , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Jan@@ ina Ball , responsible for staff in the Siemens &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
permanent availability is now considered a curse and a blessing at the same time .
England must guide the Olympic spirit and expand He@@ ath@@ row
He@@ ath@@ row will bring renewal and prosperity not only in our local communities and throughout London , but throughout the country .
for me , this was the biggest attraction of He@@ ath@@ row , just like in 2012 in London when we had a great effort to ensure that all of our nations and regions benefited from the games .
the Olympics brought great advantages to Str@@ at@@ ford and the East End .
and this will be achieved again by creating new opportunities for local residents and companies near He@@ ath@@ row .
for our local congregations there will be 10,000 new apprenti@@ ces alone , 40,000 new jobs will be created and the youth unemployment in the airport environment will end .
just as they were ahead of us in London 2012 , there will be those who will think that the challenge of the He@@ ath@@ row extension is too big .
I was told that England will never be ready for the games and that we will embar@@ k on the world stage .
the doub@@ ters had wron@@ ged in 2012 and they will also be wrong with He@@ ath@@ row .
there are always obstacles to overcome , but He@@ ath@@ row answers every question asked to him .
like the Olympic Games He@@ ath@@ row is for many and not for individual an infrastructure project .
expansion is a way to create up to 18@@ 0,000 new jobs , to create £ 211 billion in terms of weather and to bequ@@ e@@ ath skills and jobs to both the airport and the UK .
we have a great team in He@@ ath@@ row , which has implemented a £ 11 billion of expensive infrastructure investment program in time and budget , from the T@@ 5 to the world &apos;s best airport terminal , up to T2 , which was built in the midst of the world &apos;s two most frequ@@ ented run@@ ways .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now they are ready to deliver a third cat@@ walk , which is supported by £ 16 billion in private investment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the London Games of 2012 were a great success for the UK and I am confident that He@@ ath@@ row &apos;s expansion will also be one .
it is time for us to guide this Olympic spirit and bro@@ aden He@@ ath@@ row as well as secure our future trade and create a legacy of skills and jobs that England can be proud of .

Ad@@ block Plus , Facebook in &quot; K@@ atz and Maus@@ spiel &quot; regarding ad blocking
for companies that earn money with online advertising , according to one of the software manufacturers , attempts to b@@ ypass ad blocking are the same as a &quot; cat and mouse game . &quot;
on Thursday , only two days after Facebook announced that it would block scor@@ ing on its desktop site , Ad@@ block Plus published a blog post in which it announced that users could update their filters in the program to re @-@ block advertising on the social network .
on Tuesday , Facebook shared that his desktop site would change coding concerning its advertising display to make it more difficult to recognize the indication of which part of the advertisement is advertising .
but Ad@@ block announced that it has found a new way to circum@@ vent the new codes .
in a blog post , the spokes@@ man of Ad@@ block Ben Williams wrote that &quot; this kind of H@@ in @-@ and @-@ Her @-@ battle between the an@@ tim@@ ed open source community and the conver@@ ters has been underway since the invention of display block@@ ers , &quot; and that Facebook will soon come with a new solution .
the fact that the world &apos;s largest social media company has engaged in combat is a strong indication of how wor@@ rying indicators have become for the industry .
according to a study from the last year of Pa@@ ge@@ air and Adobe , around 200 million people worldwide use display lock@@ ers ; almost four times as much in 2013 .
with 1.@@ 03 billion daily active users accessing Facebook about their mobile devices , mobile advertising prints 84 percent of the advertising revenue of Facebook .
the company has opted for ad block@@ ers on desktop PCs because mobile ad block@@ ers have no effect on Facebook &apos;s mobile app for the social network and Inst@@ agra@@ m , shared a spokes@@ man .
advertisement on Desktop PCs makes a large proportion of income from Facebook , so that Facebook appears to be worthwhile to invest in such a step .
on Tuesday , Facebook shared that it would update its &quot; display preference tool &quot; to give people more control over their advertising .
on Thursday Facebook claimed that Ad@@ blocks would be wor@@ rying about new filters because they also block content on the site that are not advertising .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not a positive experience for the users , therefore we plan to address the issue , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; shared a Facebook spokes@@ man in an e @-@ mail message . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
ad block@@ ers are a bl@@ unt tool , which is why we have focused on developing tools such as Ad Pre@@ ferences to put more control into the hands of people .
woman suspected of comm@@ itting suicide on Swiss motorway
the victim was lying in the middle of the night on the motorway .
the police call on witnesses after a woman was convic@@ ted of several vehicles on a highway in the early morning hours on Thursday .
the incident occurred on the A1 near Morges in the canton of Vau@@ d shortly after midnight .
a woman laid out in the dark in an act of despair &quot; on the streets and were hit by several cars , said the police in Vau@@ d .
it is obvious that , at the age of 49 , a Swiss woman , including a truck , wanted to kill himself .
she died on the spot .
several drivers have already been heard , but some have not yet been identified , said the police who asked these as well as any witnesses of the incident to report .
an investig@@ ative procedure was opened , which is a &quot; logical &quot; step in such a situation , G@@ illes Hof@@ st@@ etter shared with Le Tri@@ b@@ une de Gen@@ eve .
however , it remains to be seen whether one of the drivers will be shown .
was a collision avoid@@ able ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is something the prosec@@ utor must decide , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Hof@@ st@@ etter . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
two similar cases in the last five years show that drivers are not responsible .
in each of the two cases - in which a person in the dark ran on the highway - it was decided that drivers should not assume that a pedestrian is running in the middle of the night on the motorway , as was the case in the newspaper .
last year a polic@@ ew@@ oman was acqu@@ itted of the negli@@ gent killing after crossing a man and killed one night on the A1 near Pay@@ erne in August 2014 .
the 22 @-@ year @-@ old sacrifice had drunk and had become un@@ conscious on the road , took the judgment .
the court found that the polic@@ ew@@ oman who had replied to an emergency call -- ro@@ de in a justified way and that the presence of a man on the street was a &quot; completely exceptional and unfor@@ es@@ eeable situation &quot; said the judge .
anyone who has further information on the incident on Thursday in the vicinity of Morges should report to the police under the number 0@@ 21 6@@ 44 83 46 or 0@@ 21 6@@ 44 44 44 .
NASA Climate model : Venus was once inhab@@ itable
according to the projections of a new NASA climate model , Venus was probably once inhab@@ itable .
scientists at the Go@@ dd@@ ard Institute for Space Studies from NASA developed a model to discover the past of Venus using tools and algorithms that are similar to those of climate scientists .
the model was designed to determine if the Venus with its hot , water@@ less surface and CO2 @-@ tight atmosphere was once brought up under similar conditions .
scientists have previously indicated that the slow revolution of Venus could be explained by their dense atmosphere .
but the latest simulation suggests that Venus could have had a thin , earth @-@ like atmosphere , and nevertheless slowly turned on .
the model also illuminated the top@@ ography of the early Venus .
the planet probably had more dry areas than Earth , but once had enough water and geographical vari@@ ability to house life and protected from rapid evap@@ oration .
the early Venus also benefited from a sun that was 30 percent weaker .
&quot; in the G@@ ISS model simulation , the slow revolution of Venus is exposed for almost two months , &quot; explained G@@ ISS scientist Anthony Del Gen@@ io in a press release .
this war@@ ms the surface and produces rain that creates a thick layer of clouds , which works like an umbrella to shield the surface from a large part of the solar heat .
the result is average temperatures that are some degrees cooler than the Earth today .
the model produced a history of Venus , similar to evolution that was previously suspected of planetary explor@@ ers .
although it was originally inhab@@ itable , Venus -- in the course of several billions years -- exposed too much heat and ultra@@ violet light .
their oceans were evapor@@ ated and their water vap@@ or was burned from ultra@@ violet light .
as their hydro@@ gen escaped , only a thick atmosphere of carbon dioxide fell back with a deadly greenhouse effect -- the Venus , the way we know it today .
the researchers shared the results of their new Venus climate model in the Ge@@ ophysi@@ cal Research Let@@ ters .
Patrick Roy stepping back as a coach of the A@@ val@@ an@@ che
Patrick Roy coming back on Thursday as a trainer and Vice President Of Ho@@ ckey Operations of the Colorado A@@ val@@ an@@ che and led to low decision @-@ making right in the decision @-@ making process of the team .
alternatively President / General Manager of the Color@@ ados Joe Sak@@ ic confirmed this decision and noted that the association will immediately look for a new trainer .
&quot; over the past three years I have fulfilled my duties as head coach and vice president Of Ho@@ ckey Operations of the Colorado A@@ val@@ an@@ che with energy , passion and determination , &quot; said the 50 @-@ year @-@ old Roy in a statement .
in the course of the summer , I thought about how I could improve this team to give it more depth , that it needs and to bring it to a higher level .
in order to achieve this , the Vision of Train@@ ers and Vice President Of Ho@@ ckey Operations must be perfectly matched to the organization .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he must also have a right of co @-@ determination in decisions affecting the team &apos;s performance . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
these conditions are currently not met .
Sak@@ ic , who had hired Roy on 23 May 2013 , thank@@ ed him for his contributions to the team .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today Patrick informed me about this decision , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sak@@ ic said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we all appreciate what he has done for our organisation and wish him only the best for the future .
during his debut season Roy has won the 2013 @-@ 14 A@@ val@@ an@@ ches as the winner of the Jack Adams Awards as the best coach of the League .
he took the club on 112 points and at first place in Central Vision , but Colorado was defeated in the first round of the pla@@ yo@@ ffs of Minn@@ es@@ ota and missed the late season in each of the last two years .
the A@@ val@@ an@@ ches recorded a 39 @-@ 39 @-@ 4 brand in the 2015 @-@ 16 season and dropped behind the Wild for a second Wild@@ card Spot in the Western Conference by five points .
as Hall of F@@ ame Tor@@ wart , Roy has won four Stan@@ ley C@@ ups -- two pieces with the Montreal Can@@ adi@@ ens and the A@@ val@@ an@@ che .
Nor@@ th@@ ee@@ pers pick up talks again , put off strike
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the labour struggles for the remuneration for North Sea workers are suspended as all the conflic@@ ting parties sit at the table for a new round of talks , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; negoti@@ ators said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
strikes against the oil field service provider Wood Group were carried out spor@@ adic@@ ally on platforms in the North Sea operated by Royal Dutch Shell .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wood Group as well as the Un@@ ites and R@@ MT Trade Uni@@ ons can confirm that we have agreed to restart the resolution process of the present stri@@ pe , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says it in a joint statement . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we will stop some day @-@ to @-@ day sessions over the next few weeks , starting next year to restart the problems .
the unions told that their last strike , which was the first in over 25 years , was a protest against possible wage cuts of up to 30 percent .
this year , Wood Group has shortened the rates of its tractors in the North Sea by around 9 percent due to negative market pressure .
the company &apos;s down@@ turn follows a 10 percent drop in on@@ shore contractors in 2014 .
the company said that additional cuts give the company the required space to come through the market down@@ turn .
shell has released for its part thousands of people and announced plans to abandon its oil and gas operations in up to 10 countries , as it ration@@ alizes its business activities as a result of its merger with the British energy company BG Group .
energy companies are under pressure due to lower oil prices , an economic situation that had reinforced by the decision of the British in June to leave the European Union .
the Scottish parliament member Dave Anderson met with workers leaders at the beginning of this week to discuss one of the biggest labour disputes that have been taking place for a generation in the North Sea .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the North Sea is important for the regional economy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the North Sea and across the country we need an economy that works for many and not only for a few , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in a statement . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 2016 , fewer than $ 1.4 billion spent on spending on new projects in the North Sea compared to an average of around $ 7 billion in the past five years .
Ke@@ pler measures the rotation rate of stars in the star cluster of the P@@ lei@@ ades
the latest mission with the Ke@@ pler Space Teles@@ cope has helped astronom@@ ers to gather the most complete catalogue of rotation rates among the stars of the star cluster of the P@@ lei@@ ades .
the new data help astronom@@ ers understand why stars revol@@ ve at different rates in the star cluster and in what context the rotation time periods with planetary origin are .
&quot; we hope that through comparing our results with other star cluster , we learn more about the relationship between the mass of a star , its age and even the history of its solar system , &quot; said Lu@@ isa Reb@@ ull , a researcher at Cal@@ tech &apos;s Infr@@ ared Processing and Analysis Center in Pas@@ ad@@ ena , in a press release .
the star cluster of the P@@ lei@@ ades is 4@@ 45 light years distant from the Earth .
many stars in this star cluster , which originated approximately 125 million years ago , now reach adul@@ thood .
they are turning on the quick@@ est now .
at peak rot@@ ational rates , these po@@ ign@@ ant stars exp@@ el large quantities of star@@ ches .
since these winds travel through the magnetic fields of the stars , they have a braking effect on the stars .
when a star al@@ tert , its rotation rate begins to slow down .
Ke@@ pler measures the rotation rate of each star by recogni@@ zing the time between the appearance of a recognizable star spot -- like sun@@ spots -- .
the latest catalogue of rot@@ ational rates indicates that more massive stars revol@@ ve more slowly than less massive stars .
Reb@@ ull compar@@ es the stars with dancers , with bigger stars more slow pi@@ rou@@ ettes than smaller ones .
&quot; in the &quot; ballet &quot; of the P@@ lei@@ ades we see that slow rot@@ ors tend to be more solid , whereas faster rot@@ ors tend to be very bright stars , &quot; said Reb@@ ull .
as the star cluster of the P@@ lei@@ ades is so close , it serves as an ideal cosmic laboratory to compare stell@@ ar qualities like rotation rates .
&quot; the star cluster of the P@@ lei@@ ades offers an anchor for theoretical models of stell@@ ar rotation in both directions , both younger and older , &quot; said Reb@@ ull .
it is still much ahead of us what we would like to learn more about how , when , and why stars slow down their rotation rates and so to speak , hang up their &quot; dance shoes . &quot;
Reb@@ ull and her colleagues have reported in three newspaper reports extensively about their latest analysis of the rot@@ ational rates of the P@@ lei@@ ades , which will soon appear in the Astronom@@ ical Journal .
a controversial bas@@ eball star emerges
the tears ran faster with Alex Rodri@@ gu@@ ez than the US bas@@ eball star in the best days from Base to Base .
after his emotional release announcement , the 41 @-@ year @-@ old pro will bear the jer@@ sey of his New York Yan@@ ke@@ es last time on August 12 against the T@@ amp@@ a Bay Ra@@ ys .
&quot; I love this game and this team . &quot;
&quot; I say good@@ bye to Goo@@ db@@ ye , &quot; explained the 14 @-@ time all @-@ star game participant in the Major League Bas@@ eball ( ML@@ B ) .
three times , Rodri@@ gu@@ ez was voted the most valuable player in the League , in 2009 he won the World Series with the Yan@@ ke@@ es .
his signature under a ten @-@ year contract awarded him $ 27 million annually since 2007 .
until the end of the contract on 31 December 2017 , he will in future be a consultant and youth coach - with full salary .
as a player , Rodri@@ gu@@ ez paid for a long time with performance .
with 6@@ 96 hom@@ er@@ uns , 3@@ 114 Hits and 2021 points for his teams ( &quot; R@@ uns &quot; ) for the Seattle marin@@ ers ( 1994 to 2000 ) , Texas R@@ angers ( 2001 to 2004 ) and since 2005 the Yan@@ ke@@ es he managed some mil@@ estones .
with Hall @-@ of @-@ F@@ ame @-@ Members H@@ ank Aaron and Wil@@ lie Ma@@ ys only two other bas@@ eball players have similar values in the most important statistics .
but in the hall of the Bas@@ eb@@ alls the 41 @-@ year @-@ old shouldn &apos;t be taken up yet .
for as successful Rodri@@ gu@@ ez - nick@@ name &quot; A @-@ R@@ od &quot; - was on the field , his appearance outside the square was so controversial .
already in 2009 , the super@@ star at &quot; ES@@ PN &quot; admitted , between 2001 and 2003 , forbidden ster@@ oids to be taken .
in August 2013 , he was closed for 211 games due to an involvement in the so @-@ called Bio@@ gen@@ esis sc@@ andal until the end of 2014 .
Rodri@@ gu@@ ez is considered the main suspect to have received high performance funding for years through an anti aging clinic in South Florida .
after a dispute , the lock was reduced to 162 meetings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the League could even have done a favour for the year 2014 because I have played for 20 years without a break , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Rodri@@ gu@@ ez back then . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
also his f@@ arewell @-@ days are not silent .
while many bas@@ eball legends get the big stage in their last games , Rodri@@ gu@@ ez frequently had to sit on the bench .
&quot; my job does not include a f@@ arewell tour . &quot;
&quot; my job ent@@ ails trying to win any game , &quot; said Yan@@ ke@@ es @-@ Coach Joe Gir@@ ardi .
after all , Rodri@@ gu@@ ez , who was married to the act@@ ress Cameron Di@@ az and told the relations with Pop@@ star Madonna and act@@ ress K@@ ate Hudson , got sympathy @-@ expressions of fans from Y@@ ank@@ ee @-@ arch@@ rival Boston Red So@@ x .
&quot; we want A @-@ R@@ od , &quot; the fans sang at the 4 : 9 defeat against the Rodri@@ gu@@ ez team .
Olympic 2016 : chen X@@ in@@ yi , Sil@@ wi@@ a Dan@@ ek@@ ova and Adrian Ziel@@ inski are first dop@@ ing cases
caught : because of a positive dop@@ ing test , wei@@ ght@@ lif@@ ter Adrian Ziel@@ inski from Poland in Rio will not be able to start .
Rio de Jan@@ eiro - The 2016 Olympic Games are over@@ shad@@ owed by the first official dop@@ ing cases .
an inqu@@ isi@@ tive ath@@ lete would have won almost a medal .
before the seventh race day , the first official dop@@ ing events have become known in Rio de Jan@@ eiro .
the chin@@ ese swi@@ mmer Ch@@ en X@@ in@@ yi , 3000 @-@ meter @-@ obstacle ski@@ pper Sil@@ wi@@ a Dan@@ ek@@ ova from Bulgaria and Polish wei@@ ght@@ lif@@ ter Adrian Ziel@@ inski were positively tested and excluded - these messages come to an end immediately before the start of the already critical athle@@ tics competitions .
in Ch@@ en last Sunday the di@@ ure@@ tic hydro@@ chlor@@ oth@@ i@@ azi@@ de was detected , which is used as a mas@@ ked agent for dop@@ ing substances .
the International Sports Court CA@@ S confirmed its expul@@ sion from the Olympic Games on Friday afternoon .
on Sunday , the 18 @-@ year @-@ old had the fourth place in the fin@@ als over 100 m Butter@@ fly , only 0.@@ 09 seconds she missed the bronze medal .
on Friday , Ch@@ en had to take part in the course of more than 50 m Fre@@ estyle .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the International Olympic Committee ( IO@@ C ) requested the opening of the B @-@ trial and a hearing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the national association takes the matter &quot; very seriously and demands full cooperation in the investigations , &quot; quoted X@@ in@@ hua from a message : &quot; we will work together with the International Sports Court CA@@ S and will accept the judgement . &quot;
for the first time in history the IO@@ C , but the CA@@ S , is responsible for the sanc@@ tion of athletes with positive cases .
also in the night of Rio the news le@@ aked across the positive test at G@@ dan@@ ek@@ ova , the 33 @-@ year @-@ old went on to the offensive .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I had three tests , all negative , and my fourth test was positive , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was an incredible shock , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she told the Bulgarian TV station B@@ NT . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is innocent , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the only explanation could be nutritional supplements , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained the ath@@ lete . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to the report , the banned substance should be the blood dop@@ ing agent EP@@ O .
Dan@@ ek@@ ova has been suspended for the time being , according to B@@ NT , the B @-@ rehear@@ sal should already have been positive .
Bulgarian Prime Minister Bo@@ y@@ ko Bor@@ is@@ so@@ v immediately reported a criticism of the ath@@ lete .
&quot; I don &apos;t understand why athletes don &apos;t draw the right conclusions , &quot; he said : &quot; we Bulg@@ arians are under observation , so many have already been excluded . &quot;
for example , all weight lif@@ ters from the chron@@ ically dop@@ ing nation are not allowed to take part in Rio .
on Friday the case &quot; Adrian Ziel@@ inski &quot; was also known , the London Olympic Champion in the class up to 85 kg was tested as his brother Tom@@ as@@ z three days earlier on the an@@ abolic ster@@ oid ne@@ and@@ ro@@ lon .
both of them deny the intake , but both may not start in the class up to 94 kg .
before the start of the athletes , especially the case of Dan@@ ek@@ ova is another serious blow for the reputation of the whole sport .
the World Federation of IA@@ AF had prohibited the entire Russian team except for systematic dop@@ ing the launch , also the nation @-@ nation Kenya produces numerous bad news in Rio .
in the swimming sport , the previous off@@ ences in China had also taken care of violent confron@@ tations among athletes .
the Fren@@ ch@@ man Cam@@ ille Lac@@ our@@ t attacked the Chinese Olympic Champion Sun Y@@ ang har@@ sch .
sun Y@@ ang p@@ ink@@ elt purple .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when I see the podium above 200 m Fre@@ estyle , I want to hand over , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Lac@@ our@@ t said in the French Radio . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
sun was also the focal point of a debate with the Australian M@@ ack Hor@@ ton .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have no time and no respect for dop@@ ing fraud , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said this . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
sun had been positively tested in the Chinese champi@@ onships in 2014 on the stimul@@ ant Tri@@ met@@ azi@@ din , but had to shut down only a three month lock .
Dat@@ enk@@ lau : so per@@ fi@@ de black@@ mail h@@ ack@@ ers their ran@@ som
program@@ mers of black@@ mailing malware are currently target@@ ing companies - and are successful .
according to a recent survey of malware infection specialists , Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ ytes , among 540 companies in North America , Great Britain and Germany , 40 percent of the surv@@ eyed companies were at least once in the past twelve months , partially victims of an attack with black@@ mail software .
in Germany , just under 20 per cent of the companies were already aiming for ran@@ som@@ ware compres@@ sors .
40 per cent of the victims willingly paid the ran@@ som demanded by the perpet@@ rators in order to be able to use the attacked systems and data again .
according to the observations of Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ ytes , the perpet@@ rators are notic@@ e@@ ably speci@@ alizing in attacks in corporate networks .
if they are successful there , the potentially rede@@ em@@ ing ran@@ som is much higher than in private users .
&quot; we are currently watching a frigh@@ tening fast evolution of the malware , &quot; says Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ ytes boss Mar@@ cin Kl@@ ec@@ zy@@ n@@ ski in conversation with the &quot; world . &quot;
in 2008 , most malware programs were still designed to send advertising .
then the perpet@@ rators discovered black@@ mail software for themselves .
only private users were the target , but the change to company attacks was quickly done in the past few months .
Ran@@ som@@ ware works on a simple pattern : once on a victim &apos;s computer , it searches specifically for recently changed files such as Word , Excel or database files , as well as archives of images and videos .
these files encryp@@ t the ran@@ som@@ ware and del@@ etes the origin@@ als sustain@@ ably .
the software then presents the recei@@ v@@ ables of the black@@ mail .
in order to get the end key code to the files , the victims must pay money - mostly in the form of the cryp@@ to@@ currency Bit@@ coin .
but where private users are the personal photo database at stake , companies are dealing with sensitive customer data or project databases without stopping production .
the damage is correspon@@ dingly higher when a ran@@ som@@ ware hits .
22 percent of affected German companies reported sales losses through ran@@ som@@ ware , 13 percent even had to completely inter@@ rupt business operations , in one case people were in danger of life .
in Germany there were already several hospitals victims of attacks whose patients can be ac@@ utely threatened by the loss of medical records .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we always tell the victims : don &apos;t pay , you only support the problem , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains Kl@@ ec@@ zy@@ n@@ ski . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but 80 to 90 percent of companies pay their data again .
it is difficult for managers to reject the perpet@@ rators &quot; demand in the face of a stand@@ still during operation .
the h@@ ack@@ ers again know this and try everything to build a good reputation .
in a current study , F @-@ Secure security researchers investigated the user interfaces and contact with black@@ mail and came to the conclusion : the perpet@@ rators are actually trying to build up some kind of customer service to take more money .
they tell their victims via chat how they can pay via Bit@@ coin , set free accessible support websites or dec@@ r@@ yp@@ t free sample files .
and if private people are redeemed for payments of just a few hundred euros , companies need to negotiate hard and pay five @-@ digit sums to return their data un@@ encrypted .
in view of the potentially high and relatively ris@@ ky winn@@ ings from ran@@ som@@ ware ex@@ tor@@ tion , h@@ ack@@ ers become more professional and share the work , declares security expert Ch@@ ester Wis@@ ni@@ ew@@ ski of the anti @-@ virus provider SO@@ PH@@ OS : &quot; a single person can write a ran@@ som@@ ware approximately within a week . &quot;
it is more likely that this is three or four people .
the program@@ mers then sell their malware in the form of a software module to the actual black@@ mail .
the previous malware kits have been created by buying malware , consulting and additional tools for a unique , fixed price between $ 1000 and $ 10,000 .
&quot; the scope of delivery includes an adjustment tool , so that smaller configurations , appearance and br@@ anding can be changed , &quot; says Wis@@ ni@@ ew@@ ski .
the black@@ heads are then looking for further h@@ ack@@ ers to spread the newly purchased software among the victims .
we live in a service industry .
so one logs in one of the forums underground , bu@@ ys the set of a criminal and instruc@@ ts another to install the software on as many PCs as possible .
payment is per infected machine .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; usually the criminals employ sp@@ amm@@ ers with spreading , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Wis@@ ni@@ ew@@ ski . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the risk of ran@@ som@@ ware is now known for many companies that better secure their data .
over 50 percent of the companies IT managers in the Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ ytes survey put their trust in resist@@ ing ran@@ som@@ ware by means of file @-@ back @-@ ups and scanner software .
accordingly , the perpet@@ rators are already pursuing new strategies .
&quot; if the encryption of data alone is not a sufficient threat to successful recovery , the perpet@@ rators are instead threatening to publish sensitive data such as customer lists or price calculations , &quot; says Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ ytes boss Mar@@ cin Kl@@ ec@@ zy@@ n@@ ski .
this means that the damage potential , depending on the type of data , is much higher than before .
the perpet@@ rators will also be able to take up completely new targets on the internet of things in the future .
at the Hack@@ er@@ konferenz , Def@@ con , security researchers demonstrated how they could get a thermo@@ stat connected to the Internet under their control .
in the middle of the winter , the activation of such a blocked heater might be worth a ran@@ som .
if the perpet@@ rators do not block entire production lines in a factory instead of heating in the future , Ran@@ som@@ ware could also become a topic in Industry 4.0 .
one for all eventu@@ alities
Honda HR @-@ V is flexible and suitable for everyday use
Honda wants to pack everything in the small HR @-@ V : a little SUV , a little cou@@ pe and also the versatility of a mini van .
sounds rather over@@ loaded , but the HR @-@ V , which was constructed on the same new platform as the new jazz , actually proves to be extremely flexible in everyday life .
although the HR @-@ V is only 1.@@ 60 m high , the passengers have a lot of space both in the first row and in the rear , it doesn &apos;t work tight at any point .
the interior materials are well finished and have a pleasant effect , only the cockpit top is falling off .
the HR @-@ V is more versatile than comparable vehicles .
there is not only a trunk of 4@@ 53 l on high @-@ level and 10@@ 26 l@@ bs with inver@@ ted back rests , but there is the &quot; Magic Se@@ ats . &quot;
this is less magical than it sounds : the seat surfaces of the rear bench can be folded like a chin @-@ up seat and thus offer storage space that is 1,@@ 24 m high from the floor to the ceiling .
the luggage compartment can be loaded well , but the load height is 650 mm higher than the comparable Peugeot 2008 .
the tested 1.6 @-@ liter diesel with 88 kW / 120 hp acceler@@ ates the HR @-@ V very powerful thanks to the torque of up to 300 Nm in wide speed ranges .
however , he should do a bit qui@@ eter for his work .
the daily consumption of 4.@@ 7 l / 100 km is pleasing .
another engine is available : a 1.5 litre petrol engine with 96 kW / 130 hp .
an all @-@ wheel drive is not offered .
the driving behavior is balanced , a good compromise between dynamics and comfort .
but the steering might be a bit more direct .
the equipment in the &quot; Executive &quot; tested top version leaves nothing to be desired .
the security systems include the City emergency braking assistant ( works up to speed 32 ) , the collision warning system and the lane keeping assistant .
the collision warning sometimes irrit@@ ates because when maneu@@ vering , it evalu@@ ates many obstacles as &quot; approaching objects . &quot;
the teles@@ copic assistant works very reliably .
and the intelligent speed controller respon@@ ds to the traffic sign recognition and throt@@ tles the speed if required .
but the full connectivity is only available for the top features : 7 @-@ inch touch@@ screen , navigation device , app integration and more .
two USB and one HDMI socket are under the arm@@ rest and are therefore somewhat cum@@ ber@@ some to achieve .
the roughly 29@@ ,000 euros for the well @-@ equipped top diesel are fine .
if you don &apos;t want to invest so much , you will receive the petrol engine from 200@@ 00 Euro , the diesel from 23@@ ,000 euros .
the engines comply with the Euro 6 emission standard .
with the HR @-@ V , Honda offers a versatile and everyday car .
Air@@ line is not liable : fall on passenger bridge
an airline is not liable for the fall of a passenger on the passenger bridge .
the Ober@@ landes@@ gericht Düsseldorf ( A@@ z . : 18 U 124 / 14 ) argued that liability is only conceivable with haz@@ ards that are typical of air traffic .
the plain@@ ti@@ ff broke a kne@@ ec@@ ap during the fall .
however , the accident could have happened everywhere - it was a general risk of life , such as the court .
the airline had to pay no damages to the man .
case of illness : when will the host be paid
sick tourists only get money back after their trip if the cause of the disease is to be found without any doubt in the hotel .
but this is only the case if more than ten percent of the guests have proven to show the same symptoms .
in the case of the trial , a family on the second day of their tur@@ mo@@ il was severely ill with diar@@ rho@@ ea and vom@@ iting .
she spent almost the whole vacation in the room .
their illness brought back the vac@@ ation@@ ers to a defective sewage treatment plant , which pur@@ port@@ edly had poll@@ uted the sea@@ water .
the family felt that the trip was lacking - and compl@@ ained against the organis@@ er .
the plain@@ ti@@ ffs did not succeed in court .
indeed , the sewage plant was in fact defective .
but the organizers only learned about it shortly before the departure of the plain@@ ti@@ ff .
until then , he had to assume that the sea@@ water was fine .
he did not viol@@ ate his duty of information , thus the judgment .
no im@@ puri@@ ties were found in the samples of the water .
the disease of several hotel guests - possibly by connecting one another - belongs to the general risk of living .
of 6@@ 91 guests only 38 were ill .
de Ma@@ izi@@ ère said , after the violence committed by refugees in Würzburg and Ans@@ bach in July , many people were worried about further attacks .
the state must be pru@@ dent and resol@@ utely at the same time to react to terrorist attacks .
it is certain that our country will not answer the violence of the perpet@@ rators with hate and division .
we will not grant this triumph to the terrorists .
if offen@@ ders would have to leave the country faster , the security and strength also increase the consent of the population for refugee policy .
de Ma@@ izi@@ ère wants to achieve a implementation of the proposals up to the Bundestag election in 2017 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he also announced another personnel strengthening of security forces , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in mid @-@ fourth magnitude over several years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the sy@@ mp@@ a@@ thetic campaign for terrorism must be punished again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is important that the interior minister declared himself clearly against action . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was a sla@@ p for the sni@@ pers in the CD@@ U / CS@@ U , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gabriel told the newspapers of the Fun@@ ke media group ( Friday ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; de Ma@@ izi@@ ère had rejected calls from the Union after a bur@@ ka ban and the aboli@@ tion of double nationality . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

better traffic flow on the motorway bridge
it st@@ ews itself regularly on the b@@ ypass - here is a picture of November .
but this should change : the right of law is to be extended .
this is a good news for all car drivers who are standing in traffic every evening in traffic on the surrounding road , when driving via the highway to the cross@@ roads ( A 43 ) .
the road construction will be extended on Tuesday and Wednesday ( 16 / 17 August ) in the area between the Hammer Street and the De@@ par@@ ture Wes@@ er Straße the right @-@ hand road to 700 meters .
drivers can then thread directly from the hammer street to the right .
the big advantage is that traffic jams up early , whereby the overall process is improved on the busy section of the Bundes@@ straße 51 .
the idea with the extended exit had the CD@@ U faction in the district to represent Münster @-@ West .
the road nar@@ rowing on the feeder anno@@ ys drivers particularly between 17 and 19 o &apos;clock .
on week@@ days , the return traffic goes up to the bridge across the Alber@@ slo@@ her path and sometimes beyond .
the reason for this is the needle @-@ eye on the B 51 just before the exit Wes@@ er Straße .
from here , traffic is only chann@@ eled via the motorway bridge .
the second track had to be built back in three @-@ quarters of years ago .
the reason : static calculations had shown that the bridge no longer has the required load capacity to record the heavy load on two lanes .
as long as this bott@@ len@@ eck and the associated work traffic jam will last , the competent state business cannot say .
however , it has to be reck@@ oned with years : because the bridge has an official remaining service life up to 20@@ 34 .
for the extension of the legal balance , the state business consciously chose the weaker time during the school holidays because of disability .
traffic is passed on the construction site on Tuesday and on Wednesday .
intercultural Travel : cultural offers for schools
the international class of the forest school visited the theatre play &quot; The invisible house . &quot;
the club N@@ ima and the Young Theatre are now planning a music project .
the NGO &quot; N@@ ima &quot; enables young people with a migration and refugee background to visit cultural institutions in Mu@@ enster .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Children &apos;s House &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; class International &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has a presentation of the award @-@ winning piece &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The invisible home &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of the young theater Münster . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the context of the &quot; Inter@@ cultural Journey &quot; initiated by the association N@@ ima &apos;s , 19 students visited the Small House between eleven and 15 years .
since the beginning of the year , the association , which aims to promote the cultural integration of young people with a migration and refugee background , offers schools with welcome classes the opportunity to visit cultural institutions in Mu@@ enster within the framework of this project .
most of the young people of the class had come to Mu@@ enster between September 2015 and March 2016 , including Afghanistan , Iran , Serbia and Syria , and speak little German .
thanks to the chore@@ ographies , the scenic images and video animations , it was possible for them to follow the course of action , thus the press release of the Young Theatre of Münster .
N@@ ima &apos;s club , founded by Dr. Tann@@ häuser West@@ er@@ berg from Spra@@ kel , and the Young Theatre will work together in the upcoming season as part of a music theatre project .
from October to December , teenagers with and without an escape and migration background will have the opportunity to attend professionally guided courses in the fields of singing , dance , acting and music .
offers for children and families in the field of theatre play and theat@@ rical language mediation are planned .
the Inter@@ cultural Travel project continues .
in view of the increased number of refugees , the association expects many classes to participate .
rain instead of shooting stars : hope for improvement of weather
the weather made a das@@ h through the bill in the southwest of Germany in the south @-@ west of Germany - but there is still hope .
the night was bad for clouds and rain to watch the heavenly spectacle , said the Chairman of the observ@@ atory Wel@@ z@@ heim , Hans @-@ Ulrich Keller , on Friday morning .
our hope lies on the night to Saturday .
the weather is supposed to be good , then we see a lot of star@@ ry ri@@ bs in the sky .
the Stern@@ schu@@ ppen are Per@@ sei@@ ds , which belong to the fastest star @-@ cliffs with 2@@ 16@@ ,000 kilometers per hour .
they have their names , because they apparently come from the con@@ stellation Per@@ se@@ us , which rises in the north @-@ east .
relaxing night : tips for sleeping disorders
in the evening , one rolls around etern@@ ally , at night , one is awake for hours , in the morning already before the wake @-@ up ring@@ ing , it is no longer necessary to think of sleep .
this is anything but relaxing .
after all , one is in good company with such problems : according to the Robert Koch Institute , about a quarter of adults have sleep disorders and more than ten percent feel their sleep frequently or permanently rather than relaxing .
how do sleeping problems or sleep disorders express ?
there are several forms of sleep disorders , and there can be various causes behind them , emphas@@ ises Hans @-@ Günter We@@ eß , member of the board of the German Society for Fi@@ ghting Equipment and Sle@@ ep Medicine .
but what you understand for the time being is the in@@ som@@ nia , that is , a break @-@ in and sleep @-@ distur@@ b@@ ance .
many people feel inadequate or inadequate , says Jens Wagen@@ kne@@ cht , member of the Executive Board of the German Medical Association , with practice in the Lower Saxony region of Var@@ el .
what &apos;s behind sleep disorders ?
the causes of sleep disorders are complex .
behind this can be organic , psychological or behavi@@ our@@ al factors , but also medicines .
in@@ frequently , sleeping disorder is an expression of another disorder .
&quot; very early awakening is most common in depression , &quot; says We@@ eß .
and it can be that different factors would like to thank each other .
those who have a her@@ ni@@ ated disc , for example , can lie badly , wake up every two to three hours and may possibly start to pon@@ der about everyday problems and worries , there &apos;s an example .
this leads to tension , and sleep is no longer possible .
when should sleep problems become a doctor ?
those who do not sleep well over a period of one month at a minimum of three nights a week should go to the doctor , advises the doctor .
the impair@@ ment can look quite different : one is beaten , tired , un@@ slept , has difficulties with the attention and concentration , is easily irrit@@ able , has mood sw@@ ings or physical ail@@ ments such as stomach or headache .
in order to allevi@@ ate sleep problems , it is important to find out their causes .
as treatment options include behavi@@ our@@ al changes , cognitive behavi@@ our@@ al therapy or even drugs - classic sleeping tablets only in exceptional cases and at most for two weeks - in@@ quired .
there is hardly any lower sleeping physician in Germany , says Prof. In@@ go Fi@@ etze , Head of the interdisciplinary sleeping medical centre of the Char@@ ité Universitäts@@ medizin Berlin .
therefore , if you have trouble sleeping , you should contact your GP first , advise you to shoot .
this can clarify if the problems have a physical cause .
who should go to the sleep lab and what happens ?
for an investigation in the sleep laboratory , doctors advise doctors , for example , snor@@ ing with breathing problems , in case of illness of the day , in case of in@@ som@@ nia , or if one does not find the cause of a sleeping disorder , explains fi@@ etze .
it is not necessary to prepare for the investigation .
you should spend the day normal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; please do not make a n@@ ap , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Fi@@ etze . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after pan@@ eling , you go to bed at its normal time .
in addition to the electrodes on the body , one carries a nose go@@ ggles , a chest strap and a fe@@ eler at the finger .
in addition , a camera records the sleeping ber@@ e@@ ens on the ceiling .
how can those affected get a grip on the problems ?
there are quite a lot of adjusting screws where you can get a better sleep .
strike counts on : regular sleep and ti@@ d@@ ging times , not sleeping too long in bed , not watching TV for falling asleep , avoiding watching alcohol and not looking at the watch at night - then one begins to reck@@ on immediately , and that is quite and at all not con@@ duci@@ ve .
what the jungle camp with missing med@@ als in swimming has to offer
the former German swimming pool Markus Dei@@ bler has expressed himself on Facebook for the dis@@ ap@@ pointing cut of the DS@@ V team at Olymp@@ is .
in December 2014 , he premi@@ ered gold at the World Cup Championships in Doh@@ a and at the same time presented his first world record .
the former DS@@ V @-@ Ath@@ lete Markus Dei@@ bler has now protected himself via Facebook in front of his ex @-@ team mates .
&quot; in a country where an Olympic winner gets 20,000 € award and a jungle @-@ king 15@@ 0,000 € should no one wonder about missing med@@ als , &quot; the 26 @-@ year @-@ old wrote on his Facebook page on Friday .
the transport system in swimming is bad , while dop@@ ing controls are very good .
this means that we can &apos;t compete with countries that promote a great deal and do not see or even operate the dop@@ ing issue .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am not saying that the controls should be set here , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he explained further . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if he wanted to start a com@@ eback , Dei@@ bler would have to be reported nine months before his first launch of the National Anti @-@ Dop@@ ing Agency Germany ( NA@@ DA ) .
that &apos;s exactly how you should keep it with countries .
&quot; those who cannot be controlled for a certain time before WM / OS by independent controllers of the WA@@ DA / FIN@@ A must not participate , &quot; says the election @-@ burger , who meanwhile operates an ice cream par@@ lor .
airport : bags arrested by baggage
professional thi@@ eves at Düsseldorf Airport
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; police officers of the Düsseldorf police managed to arrest two women and two men aged 50 to 61 years on Thursday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
as a band , the susp@@ ects had made several bags and bags of baggage .
at 9 : 30 p.m. , civil servants in the area of Düsseldorf Airport recognised a gang that was known to the polic@@ emen from past theft .
the two women and two men had committed several off@@ ences since mid @-@ July and had worked together in a collaborative , professional and professional manner .
the specialists of the Cri@@ min@@ ate Com@@ miss@@ ari@@ ats 34 can demonstrate four acts to the dict@@ ates who entered Germany for crimes against Germany .
they had a total of more than 15,000 Euros .
old buildings , some lin@@ den trees , in between still another cob@@ ble@@ stone pav@@ ement : the Rig@@ a@@ er Straße in Berlin @-@ Friedrich@@ sh@@ ain looks not like that , but the police is one of the &quot; dangerous places &quot; of the city .
when one goes along the road from east to west , one passes to play@@ grounds , a fres@@ co@@ ed kinder@@ garten and a Bi@@ ol@@ aden .
someone &quot; ug@@ ly ! &quot; spra@@ yed on the facade of a grey house .
in contrast to a Li@@ dl , which is to be demoli@@ shed soon , a house with high windows and 133 new apartments will be built here until 2017 .
article on this &quot; trendy district , &quot; as the responsible real estate agency Friedrich@@ sh@@ ain calls , is preferred over the last few weeks with burning cars .
the reason is the house with number 94 : once it was occupied , meanwhile the ten@@ ants have rental contracts , but on the ground floor there are still rooms occupied and are used for events .
since the beginning of the year , especially the Berlin inner sen@@ ator Henkel has spoken several times for a hard action by the police against the project , the area referred to as &quot; no @-@ go zone &quot; for polic@@ emen and the 94 as the starting point of autonomous violence .
after having been cleared on 22 June , the rooms on the ground floor , the Kad@@ ter@@ schmi@@ ede , with 300 police officers pat@@ rolling out official statements with 30 to 40 officials and three team cars on site , locked parts of the road and stopped visitors from entering the house with number 94 .
in the meantime , construction workers renovated the rooms on behalf of the unknown house owner .
on 13 July , a Berlin Administr@@ ative Court decided that the clearing had been illegal , and a day later , police and construction workers retired from sympath@@ iz@@ ers and residents .
on this summer afternoon the road works peac@@ efully : parents walk with children , people sit on the side@@ walk in front of the houses in the sun , others are talking about late .
in the immediate vicinity of the house there are a primary school and kinder@@ gar@@ tens .
lef@@ tist force is not the main concern of many residents : Ker@@ stin Neu@@ geb@@ auer , who lives in Kie@@ z since 1999 , and J@@ ana * , who is raising three children here , are mainly anno@@ yed by the police presence .
they share the concern of rising r@@ ents and gent@@ ri@@ fication with the residents of the house @-@ projects .
it doesn &apos;t sound like a Kie@@ z , who wants mostly police protection from the v@@ and@@ ali@@ atory left .
the dit@@ ch , which the Berlin inner sen@@ ator and the police put up between occup@@ ants and their neighbors , obviously does not exist .
Friedrich@@ sh@@ ain in the East of Berlin was actually a traditional working class district , which today has a low average income compared to the rest of the city and has a high risk of poverty .
also house occup@@ ations and the born housing projects have been part of the Kie@@ z for a long time : in 1990 , numerous houses were occupied in the former G@@ DR , including almost the entire Main@@ zer Street close to the Rig@@ a@@ er .
while the Main@@ zer was swe@@ pt under large police orders in a regular street battle , many of the projects were leg@@ alized in the Riga and are partly inhabited by the people they occupied 26 years ago .
at the same time , the district has become a magnet for tourists and ball@@ ots from all over the world over the last few years : residents of G@@ DR times and former home owners now share their neighbourhood with them .
this is also reflected in the r@@ ents that have risen by almost 60 per cent since 2009 for new rentals .
many of the new@@ buildings in the Rig@@ a@@ er are attacked as symbols for this development : you can see them at raised windows or freshly painted facades , which were thrown with ink bags .
no other road was mentioned this year as often together with the words &quot; left @-@ autonomous violence . &quot;
one reason not all neighbours consider this as a problem might be that they are not necessarily affected by crime : crime such as body injury statistics is almost exclusively directed against polic@@ emen .
the largest part of the off@@ ences make property damage that tends to meet new buildings and newly renovated houses .
for Ker@@ stin Neu@@ geb@@ auer , who has been living in a rented house for 17 years alongside the controversial 94 , there can be no question of uncertainty .
as for violence , it is crucial : the people in the 94 are their neighbors , which were certainly not .
even the famous burning cars no longer give it to the Rig@@ a@@ er anymore .
for the studied architecture , her street is not a criminal offen@@ se , on the contrary : &quot; here one helps one another , lives together on the street and gets more from each other than elsewhere . &quot;
Neu@@ geb@@ auer has been consciously drawn into the Riga @-@ Straße - and remained .
this is why it was so important for her to get back to the streets : from the police , the politics and the media , which in July all suddenly claimed the sovereignty of the city .
but in the eyes of residents like Neu@@ geb@@ auer , the road continues to be taken away from them : fac@@ eless new@@ buildings in former construction gaps that disp@@ lace the old residents .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these are con@@ domini@@ ums , which are not interesting for many - here people live rather than people who are not so well contaminated , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I can absolutely not appro@@ ve violence and destruction . &quot;
but what should you do if you never listen to someone ?
there is fru@@ stration on all sides , also with the police and the inhabitants .
for those who are angry about color bom@@ b@@ ings Ker@@ stin Neu@@ geb@@ auer has little understanding : the Hau@@ tes and the left scene were part of the Kie@@ z .
who draws , should be aware of it - just like someone who runs into a pub area that can complain badly there about noise .
all persons presented with the first names have asked to not be called with their correct name .
Ur@@ bach : Anni@@ ka deu@@ sch@@ le is a new Commissioner for Refu@@ ge@@ es
Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le is the contact person in matters of integration and organizer .
she is also a social worker on site .
since July Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le has been the Commissioner for Refu@@ ge@@ es for Ur@@ bach .
the social education team supports the team of management around Ach@@ im Gro@@ cken@@ berger .
it sees itself as a contact partner for all actors : refugees , working group refugee aid , administration , authorities and who else is involved .
Reg@@ ine &apos;s customer of the working group suggests that the volunteers are more than grateful that Deu@@ sch@@ le is now there , the ei@@ s@@ ling wo@@ ollen mill , which above all has a problem .
for example , some - less ridi@@ cul@@ ed than on the multitude of desired tasks - meant that the administration wanted to leave the place .
looking for an administrative power with a talent for languages and people , combined with a long @-@ standing experience in social work , just an ei@@ ving wo@@ ollen mill .
but administrative work is not its central area , meaning Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le .
above all , it concerns organisation , work with local people and behind the scenes as well as network activity .
the 31 @-@ year @-@ old has been there for about six weeks .
it has a 50 percent position on three years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was high time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Reg@@ ine client , that Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le supports hon@@ orable and full @-@ time actors . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are big and small problems , organizational , human and communication problems .
new containers soon stand in the Was@@ en@@ straße
a serious problem has been for some time to find homes for the connecting refugees who have been recognized .
the municipalities are responsible for the connection provision .
you must take the refugees in their own or rented living rooms .
the costs for the construction , the rent or the renovation of these accommodation must be borne by the local authorities themselves .
the responsibility changes from the administrative office to the municipality and the job centre .
problem : there are free objects , but not every landlord wants to offer his apartment .
the search has been very difficult for some time .
de facto , the administration does not find private apartments .
so far , it is not working to rely on private apartments , so Deu@@ sch@@ le .
therefore , common apartments need to be in@@ famous as it is so beautiful .
so , new containers will soon be installed in the Was@@ en@@ straße .
but it &apos;s not done with apartments .
perspective is the keyword , Reg@@ ine customer and Anni@@ ka deu@@ sch@@ le agree .
in addition to a permanent residence there are intern@@ ships , apprentices@@ hips , school grounds , one @-@ euro jobs and employment assistance for refugees and migrants who have to be und@@ ressed or established .
&quot; more places would be good , &quot; Reg@@ ine reported .
many work in the building yard or help house master builders , do char@@ itable work - and that motiv@@ ates and very ti@@ dy , as Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le reports .
she hopes that working for the community leads to a positive external effect .
this is &quot; no employment therapy . &quot;
but activity does not only mean work .
the day needs a solid structure , say Deu@@ sch@@ le and Client .
people need to develop a sense of belonging .
so it takes offers like sports , contacts with locals and above all language courses .
professional courses are rare .
so here is also the Administration and Hon@@ orary Director .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is central that the refugees feel they are welcome and welcome in Germany . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the long duration of the procedure is a problem .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they must explain to the refugees that it is just and they can bridge the time wis@@ ely , for example with language courses . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
those who at some point develop the feeling that he can &apos;t help anyone in Ur@@ bach , do not work and be useless , he will never integrate himself .
the clear majority was motivated .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but there are also problems , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says customer honest , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; people with whom nothing is concerned . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the work of Deu@@ sch@@ le and the customer is therefore always to motiv@@ ate others . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
all this is already a &quot; mamm@@ oth task . &quot;
a difficult question : do the two according to recent occur@@ ren@@ ces fear radic@@ alization , even in a small congregation like Ur@@ bach ?
&quot; no , &quot; Reg@@ ine &apos;s customer clearly states &quot; what some nai@@ ve name might call . &quot; a residual risk can and does not want to exclude it .
however , the hel@@ pers are already sensi@@ ti@@ sed .
these incidents are also the issue of refugees .
they were afraid that the assass@@ ins would completely dis@@ miss them .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they want to show that they have nothing to do with it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Reg@@ ine customer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
many would like to stay in Ur@@ bach .
so you have to look for major and honorary members on site and in the region for activities .
they always have in the background that a new blow to refugees and migrants would soon come to Ur@@ bach .
does Germany need an upper limit ?
to answer this question clearly , politics ab@@ h@@ ors .
actually it is unfair to put them on the spot .
&quot; in Ur@@ bach we haven &apos;t arrived yet where we want to go , &quot; Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le says .
no new refugees , that would relax the situation .
Reg@@ ine &apos;s customer also makes it clear that the Ur@@ bach@@ s are already busy to integrate the existing people in a reasonable way .
currently , these are about 100 people , mainly young men .
but if people are in need , they must help them , both women agree .
the political world situation is so complicated , there are no simple answers .
