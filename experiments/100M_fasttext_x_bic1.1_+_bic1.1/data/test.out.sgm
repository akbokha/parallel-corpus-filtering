<seg id="1">Golfer Langer wins the Sports Pyramid</seg>
<seg id="2">His experiences on the horse are manageable.</seg>
<seg id="3">At the end of a golf tournament in South Africa, Bernhard Langer was looking for some diversion with some colleagues on the beach.</seg>
<seg id="4">For the 58-year-old, it was a premiere.</seg>
<seg id="5">CHIO: "golden sports pyramid" for Bernhard Langer</seg>
<seg id="6">After a few minutes the horses remembered their work, they drove home to the feedbacks after a quick gallop.</seg>
<seg id="7">A kilometer at this pace, I was afraid.</seg>
<seg id="8">"it was not a good experience," Langer says.</seg>
<seg id="9">And thus the equestrian-career ended already again.</seg>
<seg id="10">On Saturday Germany was the best golfer of all time - 101 tournament victories - again close to horses.</seg>
<seg id="11">He let himself be guided by his family on the system of the ALRV, he did not even boar for photo purposes on a horse.</seg>
<seg id="12">Long was the first time in Aachen and therefore also at the CHIO.</seg>
<seg id="13">The reason was quite convincing.</seg>
<seg id="14">German sports aid handed the man from Anhausen under a small gala to the Golden sports pyramid.</seg>
<seg id="15">The sympathetic athlete does not lack awards.</seg>
<seg id="16">Federal Cross of Merit, Silver laurel leaf, Champions-Tour-Player of the Year...</seg>
<seg id="17">Even the British Queen has already adored him.</seg>
<seg id="18">Long is the 18th prize winner of the sports pyramid.</seg>
<seg id="19">In Aachen he met the first prize winner Hans Günter Winkler on Saturday.</seg>
<seg id="20">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "this award means a lot to me," "" "" "" "Langer says," "" "" "" "because it is not only awarded for sporting achievements, but also for social commitment." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="21">Langer has been promoting the offspring for decades.</seg>
<seg id="22">And so he continued the prize money of 25,000 euros equally.</seg>
<seg id="23">With 15 other outstanding athletes, the two-time US master winner was added to the Hall of Fame of German Sports on Saturday.</seg>
<seg id="24">The winners include the athletes of Hartwig Gauder and Harald Schmitt, the Turner Eberhard Gienger, the FMANN Cornelia Hanisch, Alexander Pusch and Arnd Schmitt, the Ruderer Peter-Michael Kolbe, the Judoka Frank Wieneke, the skier Alwin Schockemöhle and posthum the handball of Erhard Wunderlich.</seg>
<seg id="25">Many of these sportsmen came to Aachen on Saturday.</seg>
<seg id="26">After the official part, the illustrious company wandered to the Springstadion where the Lavazza prize went.</seg>
<seg id="27">Bernhard Langer kept a distance to the big animals.</seg>

<seg id="1">Clinton and Trumps economic policy in comparison: it's all about the money</seg>
<seg id="2">Invest in infrastructure and prevent the TTP trade agreement - both Clinton and Trump.</seg>
<seg id="3">However, the two U.S. presidential rivals are not one of the tax and energy policies as well as in a fundamental issue.</seg>
<seg id="4">The differences in economic policy between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton are fundamental, rather philosophical.</seg>
<seg id="5">That, on the role of the state.</seg>
<seg id="6">Trump wants to keep those in doubt rather small and warns of how the state of the economy can harm - with taxes and regulations.</seg>
<seg id="7">Clinton wanted to tax the economy to death and regulate it to death, he says.</seg>
<seg id="8">He himself, on the other hand, would be quite different, claims trump.</seg>
<seg id="9">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "he will drastically reclaim regulations, and he is strong for a far-reaching tax reform with lower tax rates - for private people and for companies." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="10">Clinton, on the other hand, says: the state has to fulfill certain tasks, it has disadvantaged opportunities to open up and needs money.</seg>
<seg id="11">Therefore taxes for the rich would be increased, they say.</seg>
<seg id="12">Interestingly, both are very close to infrastructure.</seg>
<seg id="13">In the future, Trump and Clinton are almost worrying.</seg>
<seg id="14">The democratic candidate announces the largest investment in new jobs since the Second World War.</seg>
<seg id="15">State investment programs in the infrastructure are traditional democratic policies and are strictly opposed by the State-critical Teapy wing of the Republicans.</seg>
<seg id="16">So on Trump you could face party discussions.</seg>
<seg id="17">The differences in energy and climate policies are more pronounced.</seg>
<seg id="18">Trump wants to build coal-fired power plants and reboot coal mining in the USA.</seg>
<seg id="19">Oil extraction should also be possible in so far protected areas, the Paris climate protection agreement will be canceled.</seg>
<seg id="20">"" "" "" "Clinton, on the other hand, wants to expand the renewables" "" "" "" "renewable energy" "" "" "" "with its investment programme and demands:" "" "" "" "a country will become the super power of clean energies and create millions of jobs." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="21">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "it will be either China, Germany or America - I want us to be." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="22">But not only in infrastructure - even in international trade agreements, the two competitors are not too far apart from each other.</seg>
<seg id="23">TPP, the transpazipan trade agreement, do not want to sign both.</seg>
<seg id="24">At the same time, both, however, do not want to isolate the US from international trade, but simply protect American jobs better.</seg>
<seg id="25">They should be paid better then, for example, Clinton calls.</seg>
<seg id="26">The current minimum wage of $7.25 is a starvation wage.</seg>
<seg id="27">He wants to raise it to 15 dollars per hour.</seg>
<seg id="28">What Trump wants to do in this question is not quite clear: once he says: the minimum wage must arise, then he says he cannot be changed.</seg>
<seg id="29">But the great discussion of the coming months is likely to be more likely to develop the tax policy of the two camps.</seg>
<seg id="30">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "on the one hand stands Trump, who wants to relieve the economy and citizens to boost growth." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="31">His critics are telling him that the budget deficit would be even greater.</seg>
<seg id="32">On the other hand, Clinton, who wants to demand at least from the rich, is to pay more taxes, and their critics say: more taxes are not the solution either.</seg>

<seg id="2">Sexual violence is almost a part of everyday life for women who are fleeing alone.</seg>

<seg id="5">Four women sit in a large kitchen.</seg>
<seg id="6">Each one has a baby, which is at most one year old.</seg>
<seg id="7">One has placed her little son in her arm.</seg>
<seg id="8">He looks curiously into the room with big eyes.</seg>

<seg id="11">She smiled briefly and kisses the little ones.</seg>
<seg id="12">The scene is normal.</seg>
<seg id="13">Until you speak with Katrin Bahr.</seg>
<seg id="14">She is a member of Condrobs, a branch manager for social assistance in Bavaria, and deals among other things with the issue of women on the run.</seg>
<seg id="15">The four women in the kitchen are poultry.</seg>
<seg id="16">They live in the north of Munich in one of the few decentralised accommodations for single-fledged women and their children in Bavaria.</seg>
<seg id="17">In January Condrobs appointed the establishment together with Pro Familia and the Munich Women's Aid.</seg>
<seg id="18">Recently it was officially opened.</seg>
<seg id="19">60 people live there - about 40 women and 20 children.</seg>
<seg id="20">There are no men - neither as visitors.</seg>

<seg id="24">In women there are other reasons for the escape: "many steal away secretly, because they see no other way out."</seg>
<seg id="25">In their homeland, they have experience with sexual violence, forced marriages, freedoms, slavery or forced prostitution.</seg>
<seg id="26">It drives them away.</seg>
<seg id="27">On the run, that goes on.</seg>
<seg id="28">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "that tugs for example call for a bottle of water a sexual act is not a rarity," "" "" "" "says Bahr." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="29">And the women are alone, they are not protected by their families.</seg>

<seg id="31">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "here too, single women in refugee camps are often considered inferior and abused in the worst case." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="32">This means that approximately 90 percent of women living in the housing in the north of Munich are traumatized, they appreciate.</seg>
<seg id="33">"some of the children are certainly not made up voluntarily."</seg>

<seg id="35">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "or they don't dare to speak openly about the experience, because the shame is too big." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="36">Since they often don't know how to help, it needs more accommodations just for them, asks Bahr.</seg>
<seg id="37">In Bavaria, the seven district governments are responsible for the housing of refugees.</seg>
<seg id="38">On the question of whether they knew about a similar project as in Munich in their sphere of competence, some respond with no.</seg>
<seg id="39">In the Upper Palatinate and Upper Franconia there is such a thing in accommodations of governments.</seg>
<seg id="40">Even in Swabia alone, fleeing women are not accommodated separately, says Karl-Heinz Meyer, spokesman for the government.</seg>
<seg id="41">In Upper Bavaria, Lower and Middle Franconia there are floors or own houses only for single women and their children.</seg>

<seg id="1">Russia and Turkey: an "outsider's alliance"?</seg>
<seg id="2">It was a gesture that ended a crisis.</seg>
<seg id="3">The leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to surrender their hands and to proclaim an official end to the eight-month-long war of words and economic sanctions.</seg>
<seg id="4">But when Vladimir Putin is receiving his Turkish counterplayer in the gilded room of the St. Petersburg Palace, I cannot deny the impression that Ankara wants this reconciliation the most.</seg>
<seg id="5">There was the handshake, yes.</seg>
<seg id="6">But Putin's smile seemed tasted and he did not radiate heat even for his restrained circumstances.</seg>
<seg id="7">Recep Tayyip Erdogan, on the other hand, spoke of his "dear friend" Putin - according to a report complete five times.</seg>
<seg id="8">I couldn't count it any more.</seg>
<seg id="9">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "he also promised that relations with Russia would not only return to their old level before the crisis, but will even improve." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="10">The next day, a newspaper described that Erdogan had behaved as if something terrible had never happened.</seg>
<seg id="11">To me his enthusiasm seemed to be rather the opposite.</seg>
<seg id="12">But one of Putin's radiating, sustainable coolness showed that Russia's head of state had nothing to forget.</seg>
<seg id="13">On the contrary, the cause of the crisis was the first thing he mentioned in his introductory words: the shot of a Russian fighter plane on the Syrian border through Turkey.</seg>
<seg id="14">Moscow's reaction to the time was furious.</seg>
<seg id="15">Putin denounced and accused Ankara to have fallen into the back of Russia.</seg>
<seg id="16">The offence was even greater, as it was done by a supposed friend.</seg>
<seg id="17">Building up the confidence is difficult, if not impossible.</seg>
<seg id="18">Public opinion in Russia has changed since November.</seg>
<seg id="19">For months, the state-controlled media launched a violent, unrestricted attack on Ankara.</seg>
<seg id="20">At one time it seemed as if the Turks were to blame for everything.</seg>
<seg id="21">At the most serious were the allegations of senior officials that Erdogan's own family had benefited from illegal oil trading in areas of Syria controlled by the so-called Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="22">He vehemently denied this.</seg>
<seg id="23">But in St.Petersburg the official message was that it was time to look forward.</seg>
<seg id="24">Finally, this meeting was held only because Putin received the excuse he wanted to hear from President Erdogan.</seg>
<seg id="25">Russia could make a kind of victory.</seg>
<seg id="26">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "for Ankara, the advantages of a ceasefire are clear on the hand." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="27">Erdogan now needs all the friends he can get after he was relieved of his ministry in a failed coup d'etat last month.</seg>
<seg id="28">Repeated terrorist attacks on Turkey have also shocked him.</seg>
<seg id="29">But there are economic motives also.</seg>
<seg id="30">Russian sanctions have hit Turkey hard - in particular the ban on charter flights that usually bring several million Russian tourists to the Turkish coast every year.</seg>
<seg id="31">The number has declined by almost 90%.</seg>
<seg id="32">In Russia, tour operators and charter companies will be relieved when flights are resumed.</seg>
<seg id="33">They are counting on a late-season rush to the Mediterranean.</seg>
<seg id="34">This week the state television forecast cheaper fruit and vegetables as soon as Turkish agrarian imports are allowed again.</seg>
<seg id="35">"" "" "" "a report in Vedemos formulated it as follows:" "" "" "" "tourists there, tomatoes here long." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="36">But the visit had an additional political value for Moscow.</seg>
<seg id="37">Ankara is furious to the West, as it regards its reaction to the attempted seizure of power as a weak answer.</seg>
<seg id="38">In addition, the continued grudge against the snail empo of EU accession negotiations and Putin - which is pierced to take advantage of the cool atmosphere and reduce the relationship between Turkey and the West.</seg>
<seg id="39">The Russian head of state won in Ankara with certainty a bonus that he demanded support for the elected state organs after the attempted coup d "état.</seg>
<seg id="40">This is well-understood for Moscow, which even has a deep-seated fear of regime change.</seg>
<seg id="41">The summit in this glittering palace by the sea made it possible for Russia and Turkey to present an "alliance of outsiders," as an analyst once described: two countries that feel abandoned and badly treated by the West and are now allied.</seg>
<seg id="42">Nevertheless, despite the public reconciliation, there are still great differences between the two.</seg>
<seg id="43">The biggest difference is Syria, where Moscow has recently played the role as a peacemakers, but where Russia and Turkey support opposing sides.</seg>
<seg id="44">It could be significant that after almost three hours of initial talks, both presidents shouted at the press conference that they had not even stripped the issue.</seg>
<seg id="45">The President of Turkey deliberately avoided a question of their differences, while Putin decided to emphasize them.</seg>
<seg id="46">There is no clear consensus on where a common denominator can be found in Syria.</seg>
<seg id="47">But after months of open hostilities - and in view of the potential for a perfect disaster when NATO member Turkey shot the Russian fighter jet - it is certainly better that the two leaders at least speak again.</seg>

<seg id="4">Ross McEwan shared the BBC Scotland that the RBS brand was associated with the Bank's global ambitions.</seg>

<seg id="19">"it's time for us to become the bank of the brands, because how do we focus internally (we asked) to make this a better bank for customers?" said the CEO.</seg>
<seg id="20">It would have been very cynical three years ago, if we had said that we would be a great bank for our customers and have launched these brands.</seg>

<seg id="1">Russian Putin fired Chief of Staff Sergei Ivanov</seg>
<seg id="2">Russian President Vladimir Putin has unexpectedly dismissed the Chief of Staff Sergei Ivanov.</seg>
<seg id="3">IVANOV was part of Putin's closest confidence circle for many years.</seg>
<seg id="4">The 63-year-old was appointed as special representative for environmental and transport matters.</seg>
<seg id="5">In a statement by the Kremlin, it says that without stating reasons, Putin has ordered the discharge of Ivanovs from his duties as Chairman of the Russian Presidential Administration. "</seg>
<seg id="6">Anton Vaino, who was Vice-Representative since 2012, was appointed to his successor.</seg>
<seg id="7">Vaino, 44, is a former diplomat.</seg>
<seg id="8">Born in the Estonian capital of Tallinn in 1972, he graduated from the prestigious State Moscow Institute of International Relations (MGIMO) and worked at the Embassy in Tokyo.</seg>
<seg id="9">On the Kremlin's website (in Russian), he later became the Chief of Staff and Chief of Staff of the Provisional Government.</seg>
<seg id="10">"" "" "" "he said to Putin about his appointment:" "" "" "" "thank you for your confidence." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="11">I think it is the most important task of the government to support your activities as head of state regarding bills of law and controls for the implementation of your instructions.</seg>
<seg id="12">Putin told the Russian TV station on Friday that Ivanov had asked to leave his post and recommended Vaino as his successor.</seg>
<seg id="13">Do the smiling faces convince you?</seg>
<seg id="14">This step has made Moscow mysterious.</seg>
<seg id="15">Sergei Ivanov was a long time one of Vladimir Putin's closest confidant and works as he was for the Soviet intelligence service, the KGB.</seg>
<seg id="16">As Chief of Staff, he was one of the most powerful men in the country.</seg>
<seg id="17">During a meeting with President Putin, which was broadcasted on television, both men claimed that the Chief of Staff will resign at his own request.</seg>
<seg id="18">But despite the ridicule for the cameras, few of them are convinced - especially now, just before the parliamentary elections.</seg>
<seg id="19">So is the consequence of a kind of power struggle?</seg>
<seg id="20">Nobody knows this at this time.</seg>
<seg id="21">But the official assertion - that a man who once was touted as a potential president, at one time wants to lead Russian environmental policy - met great scepticism.</seg>
<seg id="22">In his remarks to Putin, who are quoted on the Kremlin's website, Ivanov said it is true that I asked you in a conversation at the beginning of 2012, to give me this very complicated job - you could almost say - entrusting job for four years.</seg>
<seg id="23">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "as it turns out, I have been chairman of the Russian presidential administration for four years and eight months." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="24">IVANOV accepted the post in December 2011.</seg>
<seg id="25">Prior to that, he was Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defence.</seg>
<seg id="26">He is a member of the Russian Security Council and as Putin's former member of the KGB State Security Service.</seg>
<seg id="27">In the late 1990s, when Putin was chairman of the Federal Security Service (FSB), who replaced the KGB, Ivanov was appointed his deputy.</seg>
<seg id="28">When Putin came to power, he called Ivanov as one of five people, whom he most trusted.</seg>
<seg id="29">Once it was assumed that after Putin's second term of office Ivanov could become President of Russia, as a third term Putin would have violated Putin's constitution.</seg>
<seg id="30">But this post was taken by another, close friend of Putin, Dmitry Medvedev.</seg>
<seg id="31">Putin became Prime Minister before becoming president three and a half years later.</seg>

<seg id="2">The €1.35 billion project will be completed by May 2017</seg>
<seg id="3">Engineers have connected the northern deck of Queensland crossings with the Viaduct - which means that the bridge is now connected to Fife.</seg>
<seg id="4">It is the first of four closures of the "deckblower" approaching the completion of each of the three towers of the bridge.</seg>
<seg id="5">The bridge section of Fife is now 600 metres long and weighs 30,000 tons.</seg>
<seg id="6">It has 10,000 tons of steel and 20,000 tons of concrete and 46 slant ropes.</seg>
<seg id="7">The project is expected to be completed by May 2017.</seg>
<seg id="8">Minister of Economics Keith Brown provided a visit to the construction site today and was one of the first to move from the country to the bridge.</seg>
<seg id="9">"" "" "" "he said," "" "" "" "This is a historical and symbolic moment in the construction of Queensland crossings." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="10">We are all witnesses of an engineering art of a truly epic extent in this project involving more than 30,000 tons of concrete and steel used alone for this part of the bridge.</seg>
<seg id="11">Despite the massive size and weight of the bridge, completion of the closure between the viaduct and the bridge deck is a delicate activity requiring extremely precise tolerances for fit.</seg>
<seg id="12">In total, almost 79% of the total deck is at its place and the last section of the deck is given a concrete shot for the deck today in Rosyth, which means that the entire deck is ready to be lifted to its place on the bridge.</seg>
<seg id="13">Michael Martin, Project Manager of Forth Crossing Bridge Constructor said: "the first closure is a major milestone in every bridge project.</seg>
<seg id="14">This fantastic project represents the closure of forward-looking high and civil engineering.</seg>
<seg id="15">After the installation of the last block of the road and its connection with the northern tower in the building, we had to close the existing gap on the north or side of the country.</seg>
<seg id="16">This was achieved by pulling the northern feeder bridge 700 millimeters south.</seg>
<seg id="17">This was a massive and at the same time very delicate activity.</seg>
<seg id="18">Massive, since the Viaduct is 222 meters long, weighs about 6,000 tons and had to be pulled upwards at an incline of approx. 3%.</seg>
<seg id="19">As the tolerances to which the team works were tiny, they were only a few millimetres on each side.</seg>

<seg id="4">The SPD is proposing a "Action Plan Living" to the next council session.</seg>

<seg id="7">A regulation is missing so far.</seg>
<seg id="8">"" "" "" "said S & D Group president Christoph Bratmann:" "" "" "" "we agree with the Greens:" "" "" "" "those who want to build on urban areas must in future exhibit 20 percent of all apartments as social housing." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="13">"" "" "" "the problem, said Bratmann:" "" "" "" "there is currently no agreement between the factions." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="14">The CDU wants to make as few prescriptions as possible.</seg>
<seg id="15">The left wants harder jobs for investors.</seg>
<seg id="16">Despite this, Bratmann said, there is a sharpening of the situation on the housing market.</seg>
<seg id="17">If the action concept is implemented, it will provide additional tasks in the construction management.</seg>
<seg id="18">More staff is needed.</seg>
<seg id="19">It is unclear whether we will receive the experts.</seg>
<seg id="20">But the programme is not yet complete: because the approximately 1260 new apartments, which should be built anyway.</seg>
<seg id="21">But how do you compare the loss of other around 1300 advantageous apartments, whose promotion will expire in the coming years?</seg>

<seg id="23">To prevent this, the planning olist Nicole Palm should now be bought out-running ties from the city.</seg>
<seg id="24">In addition, it would have to be thought of taking flats back into the price bond.</seg>
<seg id="25">This is possible in the western city.</seg>

<seg id="29">Only: this does not want the owners, the housing associations.</seg>
<seg id="30">Because the number of social housing in the western city is increased dramatically, one removes itself from the goal of so-called mixing.</seg>

<seg id="1">Pokémon Go, a hunt for health and happiness that pays off</seg>
<seg id="2">It is fascinating to see how the world changes.</seg>
<seg id="3">The fact that teenagers and children do not go outside for games but prefer to spend their free time on screens, has been complained in the last decade of many.</seg>
<seg id="4">Pokemon's Go is about getting people from the sofa and getting more active.</seg>
<seg id="5">The time on the screen was initially limited to the TV, then on video games and last on smartphones.</seg>
<seg id="6">So it's great to see that technology and outdoor activities don't exclude each other.</seg>
<seg id="7">Of course I refer to the Pokémon Go-Wahn, an app based on the characters that were initially created for video games in the 1990s (later developed into a cartoon series, playing cards and other spin-offs).</seg>
<seg id="8">Like many pop culture phenomena, the interest in the publication of the game in the USA, Australia and New Zealand fell slightly in the beginning of July.</seg>
<seg id="9">Market launch in other countries was postponed by massive demand that overlaid the servers.</seg>
<seg id="10">Within a few days, Pokémon Go had more users than Tinder and nearly as many as Twitter.</seg>
<seg id="11">How does it work?</seg>
<seg id="12">In short, players go outside with their smartphones and look for Pokémons that are tracked with a GPS and as soon as they have been found, "photographs" (using a screenshot on the mobile phone) or "captured."</seg>
<seg id="13">A generation who played the game when she was younger, joined the delusion and jumped for the sofa.</seg>
<seg id="14">In the US, the game led to a considerable increase in steps that the average person puts back every day.</seg>
<seg id="15">Cardiogram, an app for Apple Watch, which followes 35,000 users, recently announced that within two days after the launch of the game, the number of followed people who train every day 30 minutes, rose from 45 percent to 53 percent.</seg>
<seg id="16">The company does not know who plays Pokémon Go - it only sees the raw data for increasing performance.</seg>
<seg id="17">Many public health awareness campaigns that people want to "take 30 minutes" to "come off the sofa" and "be active every day," have met deaf ears because many public messages are boring to health and come from people who look dazzling.</seg>
<seg id="18">Nevertheless, the importance of sport cannot be overrated.</seg>
<seg id="19">Anyone who regularly drives sports reduces his chances of developing cancer or depression.</seg>
<seg id="20">Physical activity helps in weight control, high blood pressure, diabetes and a long list of benefits that are too long to lead them here.</seg>
<seg id="21">But the wonderful thing about Pokémon Go is that it brings people to do something outdoors that makes them fun.</seg>
<seg id="22">Thus three pillars of health are covered - exercise, fresh air and sunshine as well as fun.</seg>
<seg id="23">Some people even close new friendships on the hunt.</seg>
<seg id="24">As always, there are also mosquitoes that have to complain about something.</seg>
<seg id="25">And yes, someone could run against a door.</seg>
<seg id="26">What should it be?</seg>
<seg id="27">It has been a breakthrough.</seg>
<seg id="28">Even if Smartphone-Apps like Fitbit could already track our activity earlier, they didn't give us a reason to do sports as it does this game.</seg>
<seg id="29">The new will lose its attraction and the use will fade with time.</seg>
<seg id="30">However, due to Pokemons's success, there will be more games that will unite the apps and virtual reality with the activity in the real world, helping many people in the hunt to be more active, fitter and healthier.</seg>

<seg id="2">Forget the pressure.</seg>
<seg id="3">Forget the hype.</seg>
<seg id="4">Simone Biles is immune to all this.</seg>
<seg id="5">Dynamic on the jumping horse.</seg>
<seg id="6">Effortlessly on the bar.</seg>
<seg id="7">Breathtaking on the ground.</seg>
<seg id="8">Brilliant all the way.</seg>
<seg id="9">And now finally Olympic Champion.</seg>
<seg id="10">The 19-year-old American gymnast invoked the competition title on Thursday and enlarged the gap between himself and the rest of the world in front of all eyes under the spotlight of the Olympic Games.</seg>
<seg id="11">Their overall result of 62,198 was clearly ahead of the Silver Medal winner and "Final Five" crew cameradin Aly Raisman and the Russian bronze medal winner Aliya Mustafina.</seg>
<seg id="12">The American women Simone Biles turnt on the bar-bar during the single multi-competition of women in the gymnastics stadium in Rio de Janeiro 2016, Brazil, Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="13">Biles is the fourth heterosexual American woman who wins a multi-fight title and overall the fifth, while she consolidates her call to be the best of her generation or even at all.</seg>
<seg id="14">She burst into tears when her final result was shown and her long journey in that moment came to an end.</seg>
<seg id="15">This success puts them in the same league as unique athletes like Michael Phelps, who have brought their sports to new heights:</seg>
<seg id="16">Biles has dominated her sport for the last three years, including 15 World Champion medals - including 10 gold medals - with so amazing exercises that include a mixture of ambition and precision that the 1984 Mary Lou Reson from her said she is "the best gymnast I've ever seen."</seg>
<seg id="17">She expected her last test in Brazil, a competition not so much between Biles and the rest of the athletes, but rather between her and a load of oversized expectations.</seg>
<seg id="18">Not returning with a handful of gold back to the family in Spring, Texas, would be regarded as disappointment.</seg>
<seg id="19">American women Simone Biles, left, and Aly Raisman hug themselves after winning gold and silver in the single multi-competition women's competition in the Summer Olympics 2016 in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, Thursday</seg>
<seg id="20">Biles took the first medal on Tuesday, while she served as exclamation mark at the farewell ceremony of the co-ordinator Martha Karolyi.</seg>
<seg id="21">Although Biles insisted on having never planned the future during their long journey to the top, this is not really true.</seg>
<seg id="22">Part of their floor exercises - which contain their typical Tumbling Pass - is matched to Latin American music that would fit on the street outside the Olympic arena in Rio.</seg>
<seg id="23">This is not a coincidence.</seg>
<seg id="24">This girl, adopted by her grandparents as a small child and was discovered by trainer Aimee Boormans mother during a school discharge into the gymnasium, in which Boorman trained, became a force.</seg>
<seg id="25">Since the summer of 2013, she has no longer lost a multi-competition competition, a winning series that will stop as long as Biles wishes.</seg>
<seg id="26">Even if Mustafa was led slightly by two turns, the image bleed.</seg>
<seg id="27">Floating-beams and ground floor - in which Biles holds the world title - loudly.</seg>
<seg id="28">She resumed with 15,433 on the bar-beam again - and on the ground with a 15,933 on the floor.</seg>
<seg id="29">Raisman embraced her softly when she expected her grandson - a pure formality - and tears streamed on Biles shiny red, white and blue eyeliner, as the vision she once described in her collection book became reality.</seg>
<seg id="30">The performance Raismans was a revenge for the last time four years ago when she fought for the third place, but the bronze medal went to Mustafa in a Tiebrake.</seg>
<seg id="31">This time, the 22-year-old team capitain, which is called the "Grandma" by Americans, had a head start.</seg>
<seg id="32">After her practice, she threw out Kusshlands to the public, overwhelmed by a comeback, which sometimes seemed doubtful.</seg>
<seg id="33">As for Biles, the rapidly expanding Tweet of the 19-year-old has a whole new meaning from the beginning of this week:</seg>

<seg id="1">Why we need Simone, Gabby and Laurie</seg>
<seg id="2">This is what I imagine at the Women's Olympics in the gymnastics and that for more than one reason.</seg>
<seg id="3">First, I have been with every summer Olympics since 1984 and the US has never been so dominant.</seg>
<seg id="4">And secondly: this team has three gymnasins, Simone Biles, Gabby Douglas and Lauren Laurie "Hernandez, who worked for many young girls of other skin color.</seg>
<seg id="5">The structure of this team, the Aly Raisman, the Jew is and Madison Kocian, which is catholic, makes everyone proud.</seg>
<seg id="6">This team finally reflects the US.</seg>
<seg id="7">It has solidified the black and Hispanic female presence at the top of this sport.</seg>
<seg id="8">In the last four years the number one among female gymnastics was an African-American woman.</seg>
<seg id="9">Last year Simone and Gabby # 1 and # 2 were.</seg>
<seg id="10">This shows strength.</seg>
<seg id="11">At the last Olympic Games, Gabby Douglas was a surprise Olympic winner and America.</seg>
<seg id="12">Now the world was able to witness the incredible performance of the triple world championships in Simone Biles, Douglas and Laurie Hernandez as they provided unexpected but masterful gynectic routines.</seg>
<seg id="13">On Thursday Simone became the fourth heterosexual American woman who won gold in an individual multi-competition event for women.</seg>
<seg id="14">Team member Aly Raisman won silver.</seg>
<seg id="15">We are experiencing the top of this sport, but so turn-classes across the country do not look like this.</seg>
<seg id="16">Simone, Gabby and Laurie all beat the same path as Aly and Madison to make it into the Olympic team.</seg>
<seg id="17">They are the "Last Five" because the next Olympic team will only have four female gymnastics in the team. also, this is the last year with Marta Karolyi as a trainer.</seg>
<seg id="18">But the reality is that gymnastics are an expensive sport and gymnasts come primarily in private gymnastics, which are maintained by parents who pay for the training, orientation, travel clothing, competition and hotel costs (for trainers and their trainers and families).</seg>
<seg id="19">The majority of these gymnastics are in affluent suburbs that can support the business.</seg>
<seg id="20">In these clubs the gymnasts get their entire training and this is an expensive and long-term commitment to the families.</seg>
<seg id="21">Aimee Boorman, trainer of Simone Biles, and Maggie Haney, trainer of Laurie Hernandez, trained both her athletes since they started the gymnastics.</seg>
<seg id="22">We have to provide the communities with innumerable, young girls who are inspired by Simone, Gabby and Laurie, an affordable and easy-to-reach gymnasium.</seg>
<seg id="23">I founded my gymnasium of 20 years.</seg>
<seg id="24">At my events, we have offered free and affordable gymnastics in Harlem for more than 15,000 urban youngsters (especially black and Hispanic) and trained national and international victors.</seg>
<seg id="25">In September we will expand to Detroit (my hometown) to offer the youth high quality gymnastics that deserve the opportunity to learn and benefit from this great Olympic sport.</seg>
<seg id="26">Gymnastics develop strength, flexibility and coordination for the body as well as hard work, discipline and determination for the mind.</seg>
<seg id="27">This combination offers lifelong benefits for health as well as for academic and professional success.</seg>
<seg id="28">It is the inspiration of this team that attracts thousands of young girls to interest the gymnastics and that's great.</seg>
<seg id="29">It is so important to participate in sports, especially for girls.</seg>
<seg id="30">This is an exciting time.</seg>
<seg id="31">Thanks Simone, Aly, Laurie, Gabby and Madison for this real presentation of "Girl Power" by holding the Olympic team gold and thank you for motivated her so many young girls with varying backgrounds to start their way of becoming healthy, strong and successful young women.</seg>

<seg id="1">Veterinarians want to organize more strikes after having rejected Jeremy Hunt's proposal</seg>
<seg id="2">The ministers hoped to end the dispute over the changes by adopting a reformed contract with the functionaries of the British Medical Association, but 58 percent of the 37.000 resident doctors who voted in favour of a vote refused him.</seg>
<seg id="3">In July Hunt plans had revealed plans to forcibly introduce the Treaty and said that the NHS would be in a "Niemandsland" and any further delay would be harmful to the employees and patients.</seg>
<seg id="4">The first veterinarians are to receive a new contract, which includes changes to night and weekend supplements in order to improve the maintenance at irregular times.</seg>
<seg id="5">Dr Ellen McCourt, Chairman of the BMA Committee for Assistant Doctors, announced last night in a communication with: "veterinarians tend to have serious concerns about the proposed contract, in particular that it will heat up the current occupancy crisis and will administer it to meet all doctors."</seg>
<seg id="6">With only eight weeks remaining until the first group of doctors fall under the new contract, progress must be made and the time runs out.</seg>
<seg id="7">Efforts on the part of the BMA to resolve disputes clashed with the government on behalf of reluctance and sometimes on deafening silence.</seg>
<seg id="8">This was due to a promise by Jeremy Hunt last month that his door would always be open.</seg>
<seg id="9">Jeremy Hunt must act now to raise the condition and address the worries of the resident doctors. "</seg>
<seg id="10">Should he not do so, the resident doctors have made it clear that they are willing to carry out further training measures.</seg>
<seg id="11">The last strike at the end of April saw a postponement of nearly 13,000 routine operations and 100,000 appointments, as nurses and veterinarians were involved to provide coverage for doctors on the strike.</seg>
<seg id="12">The ministers hoped to end the dispute over the changes by adopting the reformed contract with the functionaries of the British Medical Association.</seg>
<seg id="13">The BMA wants a better weekend pay for the 54.000 resident doctors who are subject to the contract.</seg>
<seg id="14">Daniel Mortimer, General Director of the NHS employees, requested the assistance doctors to stop the strike.</seg>
<seg id="15">Mortimer said: "working combat measures do not only achieve a little but strain heavily loaded teams and service providers, and prepare the patients, caregivers and their families only worries, need and interruption."</seg>
<seg id="16">Over the last two months, we talked to the committee of the assistance doctors and responded positively to the concerns about guardianship and whistleblowings with the Ministry of Health and other ministries.</seg>
<seg id="17">The employers hoped that the continued positive commitment to other important topics - such as posting, flexibility in training, additional training for those who return from a vocational training time, training rests, mutual recognition of the curriculum, training certificates, mutual recognition of the curriculum, training certificates, mutual recognition of the curriculum, training certificates, mutual recognition of the curriculum in November, February and May.</seg>

<seg id="3">The anticoagulant medication Ticagrelor reduces the risk of repeated heart attacks for people with heart disease.</seg>

<seg id="6">The NHS regulatory authority has recommended a four-year intake to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems.</seg>
<seg id="7">Around 140,000 people suffer a heart attack every year and a quarter of them suffer from a further heart attack or stroke.</seg>
<seg id="8">Heart attacks and strokes are caused by accumulations of fatty material in the artery walls which form bellows.</seg>
<seg id="9">If the topping breaks apart, it can cause a blood clots that clogged the blood flow to the heart and thereby cause a heart attack.</seg>
<seg id="10">When the blood clot triggers, it can flow through the blood stream and clog the blood flow to the brain, causing a stroke.</seg>
<seg id="11">Persons who have already had a heart attack are subject to a higher risk of having another.</seg>
<seg id="12">Ticagrelor, which is produced by the British company AstraZeneca and is marketed under the trade name Brilique, reduces this risk by making the formation of blood clots unlikely.</seg>
<seg id="13">The draft of NICE, which was published today, recommends a 12 month intake of 90mg Ticagrelor, followed by 60mg with a twice daily intake of aspirin for the next three years.</seg>
<seg id="14">Professor Carole Longson, Director of the NICE health technology evaluation centre said: "despite the availability of secondary prevention, a quarter of all those who have suffered a heart attack have another heart attack or a stroke - often with disastrous consequences."</seg>
<seg id="15">The fear of a renewed heart attack can have significant negative effects on the quality of life of a person.</seg>
<seg id="16">The experience shows that in combination with aspirin, Ticagrelor is effective in reducing other heart attacks and strokes in people who already had a heart attack.</seg>
<seg id="17">Due to a preliminary recommendation of Ticagrelor we are pleased that we are able to extend available treatment options to thousands of people who can benefit from it.</seg>
<seg id="18">The information on efficacy and safety of Ticagrelor - especially the risk of bleeding - is limited to a period of up to three years.</seg>

<seg id="2">The world outside is a dangerous place, but this video by Dailymail.com could make it a bit safer for you.</seg>
<seg id="3">We spoke with Rhone Mizrachi, a Grand Master of the Krav Maga Association in New York to find out how to deal with armed robbers at close distance.</seg>
<seg id="4">Regardless of whether you're approaching from front or back, this video will show you how to turn the skewer around for your robber.</seg>
<seg id="5">If you look back from behind, you should turn around as first so that you can see your attacker and go out of the shot line, "says Mizrachi.</seg>
<seg id="6">Then seize the weapon between your forearm and your shoulder before hitting him with your free elbow.</seg>
<seg id="7">Knock it with your knee in the bar and twist, while the aggressor roams from pain, the weapon out of his hands. hit him with the barrel in the face and move backwards while they straighten the weapon on him.</seg>
<seg id="8">With aggressors, approaching from the front, the technique is similar - move your body out of the shot, seize the weapon and twist it so that the attacker can't shoot.</seg>
<seg id="9">Shift the weight to the weapon at the same time and hit the Attacker on the chest, then twist the weapon out of its grip before moving backwards and the weapon to straighten it.</seg>
<seg id="10">Sounds difficult?</seg>
<seg id="11">Watch the video to see exactly how it's done in Mizrachi.</seg>

<seg id="2">A British traveller underlined his immune system and strangeness of a serious test - taking some of the dirtiest and most disgusting places in Europe.</seg>
<seg id="3">The moderator and author Ian Wright, 51, from Suffolk scrapped his course on a euro note, a railing at Piccadilly Circus, a sink of a train toilet and a public phone in Russia to prove the resilience of his immune system.</seg>
<seg id="4">Before leakage of each object, he used a luminometer to show himself and to show us what he is getting involved.</seg>
<seg id="5">But the experiment, which was filmed under the title "The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength," brought some surprising results.</seg>
<seg id="6">The thought of rejecting the rinsing button of a pull toilet that has been used by thousands of others may be totally distracting, but actually there are more bad bacteria in a kitchen sink.</seg>
<seg id="7">On his journey across Europe, Mr. Wright talked to doctors and medical professionals about the promotion of intestinal bacteria as well as about his own health.</seg>
<seg id="8">Fortunately nothing left what he licked, more than a bad taste in the mouth.</seg>
<seg id="9">Mr. Wright was known to test the resilience of his bowel by travelling through the world and ate peculiar and wonderful things.</seg>
<seg id="10">From public funds to stations up to sinks of toilets, the task posed its immune system definitively under a sample</seg>
<seg id="11">In the film he said: "as a child I was relatively unconcerned about my health and I have put all sorts of things into my mouth, earth, worms and mud water."</seg>
<seg id="12">In the film, he was justified in his call.</seg>
<seg id="13">The only thing he refused was a dirty public toilet in Russia.</seg>
<seg id="14">His test screed showed a luminometric number of more than 4000 units.</seg>
<seg id="15">In comparison to this, the luminometric number of freshly washed hands is less than 60.</seg>
<seg id="16">But there was a Russian toilet which he refused to refuse after its luminometric number exceeded 4000 units while freshly washed hands have one of less than 60.</seg>
<seg id="17">Wright and Finnish manufacturer of dairy products Valio produced the travel film "The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength," which shows the number of bacteria in different places like the bathroom</seg>
<seg id="18">"" "" "" "in the film he says:" "" "" "" "this is close to the worst that I have in a toilet." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="19">There is nothing more than that!</seg>
<seg id="20">I'm not going to lick here because it's disgusting here.</seg>
<seg id="21">"the Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength" was produced in collaboration with the Finnish manufacturer of dairy products Valio.</seg>
<seg id="22">The company equips Mr. Wright with Valio Gefilus, which contains lactic acid bacteria as well as vitamin C and D to support the promotion of intestinal bacteria and immune system.</seg>
<seg id="23">Valios Senior Venice President for snacks, juices and new categories Niko Vuorenmaa says: "we really wanted to offer consumers something new.</seg>
<seg id="24">Something that is fascinating to look at and at the same time explain the advantages of probiotics.</seg>
<seg id="25">We performed crazy brainstorming that ended up saying "Let's call Ian."</seg>
<seg id="26">They claim that the interest in intestinal health is becoming a global phenomenon</seg>
<seg id="27">Instead of talking about the products, we wanted to put them into a larger context - the good and bad bacteria in our everyday surroundings, the importance of gut health and how it is associated with the immune system.</seg>
<seg id="28">The growing interest in gut health is a global phenomenon and with the documentary we were able to provide consumers with more information in an interesting way.</seg>
<seg id="29">I also think the film shows that we have a great sense of humour!</seg>
<seg id="30">Tom Hakala, who directed the film, added: "let me say so - I would have lost my respect for Ian, if he had checked out some of the things I have instructed him to lick, like the disgusting Russian toilet that is shown in the film."</seg>
<seg id="31">Of course there were things in which it was easier to get Ian to lick her out and others, in which this was quite difficult.</seg>
<seg id="32">"" "" "" "I'm glad we recorded some of these dirty treats on film." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="33">In a survey conducted by Valio in 2015, 84 percent of all respondents associated lactic acid bacteria associated with the well-being of stomach and intestines and 58 percent said they use at least occasionally products containing attached lactic acid bacteria.</seg>

<seg id="2">An asocidal family left their social apartment after deloading with a damage in the amount of £50,000 because it had terrorized its neighbors.</seg>
<seg id="3">Tanya Skeldon and her partner Shaun Trebilcock were thrown after a long list of complaints from their estate in Saltash, Cornwall.</seg>
<seg id="4">After they were forcibly removed from their property, shocked employees of the housing cooperative found the property in an irreparable condition.</seg>
<seg id="5">The walls pointed plaintive holes, wood panels were torn up, rubbish was scattered on the floor and graffiti was smeared to the walls.</seg>
<seg id="6">The family has been resettled and it is assumed that they are now living in a private accommodation</seg>
<seg id="7">Donna McEvoy, who works for home management at Cornwall Housing, said she fears that the apartment is no longer available.</seg>
<seg id="8">"" "" "" "she said," "" "" "" "It was an absolute nightmare for the people here and I think people don't have to live this way." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="10">The family is notorious and their reputation is likewise.</seg>
<seg id="11">The couple had three sons who lived in the apartment in the meantime and the police said that the terror which the family had inflicted, street fights with baseball bat, intimidation of residents, drug abuse, drug trafficking and excessive screaming, striped and cursing.</seg>
<seg id="12">Skeldon, 47, whose name was on the lease, got an arrangement for anti-social behavior in June.</seg>

<seg id="24">Adam Fitzpatrick, Neighbourhood Enforcement Managers of Cornwall Housing, stated that it would have abused the family to cooperate with local authorities.</seg>
<seg id="25">The family lived in the house where the police were called at regular intervals for 20 years</seg>
<seg id="26">Rubbish and old toys were thrown down on the overgrown side of the church building.</seg>
<seg id="27">He added: "it is a shame that the lessee abused to accept any responsibility for their behavior and family because deloaling is always the final step to consider Cornwall Housing.</seg>
<seg id="28">This was a very difficult case because the behaviour was extreme and their actions for their neighbours had to be horrible.</seg>

<seg id="2">The IOC wants to establish a disciplinary committee on the event.</seg>
<seg id="3">Kenya's athletes face the second doping affair at the Rio de Janeiro event.</seg>
<seg id="4">After an attempt at a doping control in the Olympic village, Kenya has sent a trainer home.</seg>
<seg id="5">The International Olympic Committee agreed to immediately set up a disciplinary committee in order to investigate the case.</seg>
<seg id="6">A Kenyan functionary had informed that the former Sprinter and today's coach, John Anzrah, gave a urine sample in the Olympic village under the name of the 800-meter-runner Ferguson Rotich.</seg>
<seg id="7">This was reported to the Kenias team management of the doping controllers.</seg>
<seg id="8">The IAAF World Federation sent the IOC information on the case in order to exert its own investigations, an IAAF spokesperson.</seg>
<seg id="9">"depending on the results of the study and the following measures undertaken by the IOC, IAAF will make an assessment," he stated in an IAAF explanation.</seg>
<seg id="10">"he (Anzrah) went to the doping control station and has spent himself as Ferguson Roti, released the sample and signed," declared Kenias Chief of Mission Stephan Arap Soi.</seg>
<seg id="11">He was in possession of the accreditation of the athlete, who stood on the list for the training controls of the World Anti-Doping Agency.</seg>
<seg id="12">Ferguson Rotich became more than 800 metres in Beijing in 2015.</seg>
<seg id="13">Four days earlier, the Kenyan athletics delegation leader Michael Roter had been deducted from the Rio games.</seg>
<seg id="14">He is said to have informed athletes of his country about pending doping tests.</seg>
<seg id="15">According to media reports, he was said to have been arrested at his return to Nairobi's airport.</seg>
<seg id="16">In Kenya, the IOC has been monitoring many doping contracts for some time under special observation.</seg>
<seg id="17">At the announcement of the more than 2000 doping target controls submitted by the IOC before the Rio games, unusual attention was drawn to the fact that athletes from Kenya and Russia were targeted.</seg>
<seg id="18">The world anti-doping agency had put a lot of pressure on the African country before the summer games in Brazil to create an anti-doping law and a functioning control system.</seg>
<seg id="19">The law was passed a few weeks before the Olympics.</seg>
<seg id="20">As a result, the WADA Kenya accepted from the list of countries whose doping control is compliant with the rules of WADA.</seg>
<seg id="21">Kenya is considered a big runner-nation.</seg>
<seg id="22">The athletes of the country won the most medals at the 2015 World Cup in Beijing.</seg>
<seg id="23">In a series of TV reports of the ARD, allegations were made that in Kenya doping means are easily accessible and there should be a considerable mentality of sports betting.</seg>

<seg id="1">"West Side Story" with Cecilia Bartoli</seg>
<seg id="2">In the Shakespeare-year, the Salzburg Festival presents the "West Side Story" with Tony and Maria as a tragic romantic couple, similar to Romeo and Juliet.</seg>
<seg id="3">With it a surprising Cecilia Bartoli.</seg>
<seg id="4">A musical conquers Salzburg: the West Side Story, "Leornard Bernstein's masterpiece.</seg>
<seg id="5">The artistic director Cecilia Bartoli wanted to bring the musical into the temple of classical music and filled himself with the role of Mary a youth dream.</seg>
<seg id="6">In the orchestra pit the Simón Bolívar Orchestra under the direction of the Venezuelan conductor Gustavo Dudamel: "this music is full of rhythm," he heats.</seg>
<seg id="7">We always say that it is very Latin American.</seg>
<seg id="8">There are many Latin American ingredients in their tempo and their melody.</seg>
<seg id="9">It's a wonderful mixture, the perfect recipe for our orchestra.</seg>
<seg id="10">I would say that we really have Bernsteins music in our blood!</seg>
<seg id="11">In this staging, Bartoli plays an older Maria.</seg>
<seg id="12">She remembers her love with Tony while the younger Maria is playing and dancing.</seg>
<seg id="13">The role of Mary has always fascinated me.</seg>
<seg id="14">First of all because it is musically unusual!</seg>
<seg id="15">And then there would be Mary's personality.</seg>
<seg id="16">She says it in her song: "I feel pretty, oh so pretty, I feel pretty and witty and bright."</seg>
<seg id="17">So it is clever, of course also naïve, and very passionately.</seg>
<seg id="18">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "she is very similar to me, my Italian character I'm a Roman," "" "" "" "laughs Bartoli." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="19">Dudamel is full of praise for the opera singer: "Cecilia is a wonderful artist."</seg>
<seg id="20">It is such an honour to work with her.</seg>
<seg id="21">It is a monstrous generous human being.</seg>
<seg id="22">"" "" "" "and Bartoli returns the compliment:" "" "" "" "Dudamel is such an extraordinary artist and very passionate!" "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="23">Conducting is a necessity for him.</seg>
<seg id="24">You see it in each of his movements, in his eyes, it's his life!</seg>
<seg id="25">It is such a huge opportunity to share this musical experience with him.</seg>
<seg id="26">We both have a rather southern temperament, a fire, a passion and also a happy approach to life, which is very important at all!</seg>
<seg id="27">For the American director Philip Wm. McKinley is the "West Side Story" up-to-date: "this piece deals with prejudice and fanaticism."</seg>
<seg id="28">Today we have the refugees, at that time the Puertorians went to New York, and the New York residents did not want them.</seg>
<seg id="29">They are the same themes, and they are as meaningful today as they were then.</seg>
<seg id="30">59 years later, the piece is still relevant.</seg>

<seg id="2">"anyone who doesn't adapt and praise Erdogan is sitting on packed suitcases," says the president of the Gülen-near Foundation Dialogue and World, Ercan Karakoyun.</seg>
<seg id="3">In the short term, the Kurdish congregation of Germany pays off with tens of thousands of refugees fleeing from Turkey to Germany.</seg>
<seg id="4">In the medium term, it could even be "a few hundred thousand," believes Ali Toprak, the chairman of the association.</seg>
<seg id="5">Following the attempted coup attempt by Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan after the attempted coup, the Kurdish congregation of Germany anticipates a mass flight to Germany.</seg>
<seg id="6">"in the short term, I reckon with tens of thousands, in the medium term with several hundred thousand refugees from Turkey in Germany, when the Erdogan regime continues to fight the minorities and the democratic opposition," says the President Ali Toprak of the "World" on Friday.</seg>
<seg id="7">Because the government had already beaten up Kurdish strongholds before months, 500,000 Kurds were fleeing within Turkey.</seg>

<seg id="2">Strange Mecklenburg-Vorpommern: the locals don't get anything from the summer election campaign - and the holiday makers from North Rhine-Westphalia are not allowed to choose the country's day.</seg>
<seg id="3">They understood in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern.</seg>
<seg id="4">2021 will not be held directly at the end of the summer holidays, the Schwerin parliament has already decided at the beginning of the year.</seg>
<seg id="5">Because it's not stupid as to date: summer holidays, heat and a summer balm fight - this is biting.</seg>
<seg id="6">The locals, who are to be convinced by the election fighters, are on holiday.</seg>
<seg id="7">Most of the vacationers in the country on the way to Usedom, Ruegen or Hiddensee are no natives, so are not allowed to choose the country's day.</seg>
<seg id="8">There are practical problems: the holidays are helpers who hang posters, inflate balloons, distribute flyers and enumerate voices in the end, just drive out troublesome.</seg>
<seg id="9">Until 4 September 2016, the election and the last day of the holiday, Mecklenburg-Vorpommern has to pass an election campaign close to the people.</seg>
<seg id="10">The hot phase, if you can say it at all, has just begun.</seg>
<seg id="11">And it's about something: Prime Minister Erwin Sellering, leader of an SPD / CDU coalition, must fear his ministry.</seg>
<seg id="12">The SPD, the strongest party since 1998, is now clearly behind the CDU in surveys.</seg>
<seg id="13">Exciting is how strongly newcomer AfD cuts off and what remains at the end of coalitions.</seg>
<seg id="14">Celery, 66 years old and head of government since 2008, makes an almost inconspicuous campaign, one can see from his big posters.</seg>
<seg id="15">He travels across the country, distributes roses and chatting a bit with the people, just like his legendary eloquent predecessor, Harald Ringstorff also did.</seg>
<seg id="16">Otherwise, Seelering has got cold feet and gives Chancellor Merkel the blame for the blooming of the AfD.</seg>
<seg id="17">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "their refugee policy, their" "" "" "" "We create this" "" "" "" "accelerates the rise of the right-wing populists, which will probably cost him the nice office." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="18">The CDU with its top channel candidates, the Interior Minister Lorenz Caffier, has already experienced how it is when you make electoral campaigns at the right time at the wrong time.</seg>
<seg id="19">She has invited Chancellor Angela Merkel to large-format demonstrations twice; Merkel's federal election district is located in the north-east.</seg>
<seg id="20">But the target group did not agree, there were more Nordrhein-Westfalen, Berliner and Saxonia as Mecklenburg and Vorpommern.</seg>
<seg id="21">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "there was probably the majority from other states," "" "" "" "said Vincent Kokert, Secretary General of the CDU in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, recently in NDR." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="22">But it's too bad for anyone from other corners of Germany to listen to Angela Merkel once.</seg>
<seg id="23">Otherwise, the Northeast CDU largely dispenses with the usual election campaigns at market places and in front of shopping malls with umbrellas and balloons.</seg>
<seg id="24">"" "" "" "this," "" "" "" "says Kokert, plays only a" subordinate role "" "" "" "." "" "" "" "</seg>
<seg id="25">Also the Union has noticed that in the country you leave the base, that it needs to be very strict, to find again a wire to the people.</seg>
<seg id="26">You are on the left, the SPD, the Greens: there is hardly any present in the vast expanses of the country.</seg>
<seg id="27">The Council of the CDU election fighter Kokert on his fellow combatants is, however, self-revealing: "you have to go where it hurts, namely, where people are: Dorotheeste, golden weddings, every birthday party must be used."</seg>
<seg id="28">Because much is on the game, Sellering has now called its SPD to an especially committed campaign.</seg>
<seg id="29">In surveys, the Socialists and Democrats were at least 22 per cent behind partner CDU (25) and just ahead of the AfD (19).</seg>
<seg id="30">At the 2011 election, the SPD won still 35.6 percent ahead of the CDU (22).</seg>
<seg id="31">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "the Greens, small party with seven percent in polls, are likely to make the leap into the rural life." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="32">They make a modern virtue out of the need for a holiday and largely transfer their election campaign into the internet.</seg>
<seg id="33">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "online election campaign," "" "" "" "says the president of the country Claudia Müller." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="34">Otherwise, green ballot fighters go on search for local voters among the vacationers.</seg>

<seg id="2">At the speed with which the B 27 is rehabilitated, there is nothing to complain about.</seg>
<seg id="3">For those responsible for the construction work starting at 5.30 a.m. and ending at 8pm, there are all praise.</seg>
<seg id="4">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "they did everything quite jagged," "" "" "" "says Elvira Tetzlaff from the jet fuel station." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="5">This is a superteam.</seg>
<seg id="6">There is no delay.</seg>
<seg id="7">The construction site could be moved to the south according to schedule at the beginning of the week, until the end of October everything will be finished.</seg>
<seg id="8">The opposite of those responsible for the construction work is also commended, for example when it comes to the establishment of expeditions.</seg>
<seg id="9">Since the construction site was migrated to the south on Monday and also the blockage of the asphalt road in Ofterdingen was lifted and the connection to Rottenburg again exists, the traffic situation within the town has eased.</seg>
<seg id="10">The citizens can now drive from Ofterdingen on both sides of the B 27.</seg>
<seg id="11">The pass traffic through the place seems to go back.</seg>
<seg id="12">"there were some considerable complaints," says the Deputy Chief Executive Officer Florian King, responsible for the transport management of the refurbishment.</seg>
<seg id="13">The residents of Bacharstraße, Steinlachstrasse, Hafnerstraße and Weiherrain had to fight with more traffic noise because many creeping routes were looking and more familiar with their navigation system than the signposting.</seg>
<seg id="14">What led to the fact that some trucks were franking in residential areas.</seg>
<seg id="15">Since the speed limits were not met, the municipality also called for Mössingen.</seg>
<seg id="16">"there were significant transgressions," says King, who made himself aware of the situation on the spot.</seg>
<seg id="17">Two to three per minute have been brewed.</seg>
<seg id="18">The fastest was on the way at 77 km / h in the Tempo-30 zone.</seg>
<seg id="19">Since the construction site has been moved on, it has become quieter.</seg>
<seg id="20">For the business people on the B 27 it is only a small consolation that the road is now open for customers from Rottenburg.</seg>
<seg id="21">Businessmen do not like to look into the cards.</seg>
<seg id="22">But the fact that the B27-refurbishment has led to a fall in sales leads everyone to look through.</seg>
<seg id="23">However, some are more and some less affected.</seg>
<seg id="24">Those who have less to do with the "end customer" are thus produced for other companies, for whom the refurbishment has hardly any consequences.</seg>
<seg id="25">Thomas Sulz also talks about a "maximum slight decline" at the dealership in Maier, but also admits that "the race is missing naturally."</seg>
<seg id="26">The most heavily trafficked are the local along the road.</seg>
<seg id="27">J. Albert Göhner, owner of Steakhouse, formerly crown, finds clear words.</seg>
<seg id="28">This is existential threat.</seg>
<seg id="29">"" "" "" "not only him, but all the restaurants" "" "" "" "hit hard" "" "" "". "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="30">The customers were missing from Hechingen, Balingen and Rottweil.</seg>
<seg id="31">We must be happy about every euro turnover.</seg>
<seg id="32">"" "" "" "he cited the sales losses in" "" "" "" "far above 50 percent." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="33">"" "" "" "road marking took its operation" "" "" "" "for two years." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="34">Half of his co-workers have to be released.</seg>
<seg id="35">If I had a company with 4000 employees and half had been dismissed, the policy would have reacted differently.</seg>
<seg id="36">Instead, President Jörg Schmidt has made a request from Göhner if there could be a financial compensation with the hint that the restaurant would otherwise benefit from the advantages of the location on the B 27.</seg>
<seg id="37">Göhner knows from other counties, where something more generous has been handled.</seg>
<seg id="38">In all the complaints, Göhner is sure that his restaurant will continue to exist.</seg>
<seg id="39">After all, family business has been settled here since 1715, pointing to the long history.</seg>
<seg id="40">He can understand that other regular passengers are now less frequent due to complicated traffic management.</seg>
<seg id="41">If you can't get there, it is also somewhere else beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="42">Göhner has no doubt that his regular clientele comes back to the end of the renovation work.</seg>
<seg id="43">Despite the crisis of BSE and avian influenza, Göhner considers the impact of the B 27 construction works on his clientele for the greatest crisis that its restaurant has experienced in its long-standing history.</seg>
<seg id="44">Six months of construction work, which is brutal.</seg>

<seg id="15">The call for more video surveillance and personnel for security authorities is also not surprising.</seg>
<seg id="16">In part, de Maizière starts a second run for proposals which have not been made with the SPD so far: he wants to put sympathy for terrorist groups under penalty and knock jihadists with dual citizenship to the German passport.</seg>
<seg id="17">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "this will be difficult points for the SPD," "" "" "" "clears the CDU man." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="18">He nevertheless believes this to be reasonable and also demands nothing, which in the coalitional partner has no chance anyway.</seg>
<seg id="19">A few new ideas also present de Maizière.</seg>
<seg id="20">They are in part in themselves: he plans quick processes for deportations and more possibilities to incarcerate people before deportation.</seg>
<seg id="21">Refugees who are targeted in the country should check their smartphones first and open social media accounts for a security check.</seg>
<seg id="22">In the case of suspicions for rejected asylum seekers, he wants to make some even worse than to date - such as committing crimes or deliberately throwing away their papers to disguise their identity.</seg>
<seg id="23">Some of these are political and legal.</seg>
<seg id="24">Many things also seem to have been displeased and open questions openly.</seg>
<seg id="25">And at some points - in the impatient treatment of patient - for example - the question arises: what does that have to do with security and terror?</seg>
<seg id="26">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "yes, says de Maizière, it is important to differentiate between the topics refugees and terror." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="27">But it can't be said that the residents of Ansbach and Würzburg were refugees.</seg>
<seg id="28">In addition, many people were worried about security in the face of the high number of refugees.</seg>
<seg id="29">And things that people had deeply devoted themselves could not be excluded even in election times.</seg>
<seg id="30">Inner security has shifted enormously into the focus.</seg>

<seg id="32">Then the attacks in Würzburg and Ansbach.</seg>
<seg id="33">The uncertainty is great.</seg>
<seg id="34">And yes, elections are available.</seg>
<seg id="35">The Union and the SPD are therefore increasingly in position in the issue of internal security.</seg>
<seg id="36">In the past few days, the two parties went up high.</seg>
<seg id="37">Only an armed dispute over the equipment of the Federal Police, then on a security policy collection of some Unions interior ministers, in which the chiefs also demand a burka ban and a departure from the dual citizenship.</seg>

<seg id="25">"" "" "" "the" "" "" "" "Focus" "" "" "" "had reported that Volkswagen now grants its German customers a guarantee for converted diesel models." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="26">This would have confirmed VW representatives in the Federal Ministry of Transport last Monday.</seg>

<seg id="29">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "deviations from this are not accepted," "" "" "" "declared Minister of Transport Alexander Dobrindt (CSU) according to the ministry." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="30">VW has assumed that fuel consumption, CO2 emissions and engine power do not take place after retrofitting, and all type-approved vehicle values remain unchanged.</seg>
<seg id="31">Volkswagen does not use the term "guarantee" but not as it was meant in business trips.</seg>
<seg id="32">With the wide term "guarantee" Volkswagen has the possibility that for example, for example, half a year after the conversion, customers might get into a workshop with a motor failure - and this could lead to the new software, even if the damage has nothing to do with it.</seg>
<seg id="33">Even in customer interest, it is important to avoid that in case of any other damage that has nothing to do with the scandal, there is uncertainty about possible warranty regulations as it was meant.</seg>
<seg id="34">This is why VW does not use the term "guarantee."</seg>

<seg id="1">Destination Plates: who buys records?</seg>
<seg id="2">Solitary middle-aged men love plates.</seg>
<seg id="3">Before committing to the comment section, under the pseudonym Non-Alleviator Men of the Middle Ages with rough insults, this statement derives from current data.</seg>
<seg id="4">According to YouGov, the much discussed reemergence of vinyl records is not attributable to a boom in millennials, which want to welcome the news of physical objects, but to Midlife-Nostalgia.</seg>
<seg id="5">Those who recently purchased a plate are all foresight forwards between 45 and 54.</seg>
<seg id="6">In fact, the age group of 18-24 is the most unlikely killing group.</seg>
<seg id="7">It is also not a hordes by hobby collectors - it has an emotional meaning: older record buyers prefer to retain their feelings for themselves (56% vs. 53%) and enjoy spending time alone (69% vs 66%).</seg>
<seg id="8">But do the results of YouGov match?</seg>
<seg id="9">If this blog is a news report on TV, the camera would follow me while I run in the midst of a busy street in Soho, wearing a modest gray suit and stuffed wild before I stand, hold my hands and say something better: "so, let's take a closer look at it."</seg>
<seg id="10">So let's take a look at it.</seg>
<seg id="11">Even if the heart of Soho is slowly losing its charm - Hotels, restaurants and offices now fill the buildings in which once independent sellers were located - there is still a handful of fantastic plate specialist shops.</seg>
<seg id="12">I would probably ask the cameraman to switch off the camera for the next part in which I stand in close proximity to various men in such stores and try to assess their age and minds through observation.</seg>
<seg id="13">Stuart from Glasgow, 55, which I of Sister Ray (number of data: two young women, three middle aged men) to Reckless Records (Number of records: eight middle-aged men, a woman, probably around the 20), is one day long because of a meeting in London and goes through the shops to fill the couple of hours.</seg>
<seg id="14">Is he a collector, I ask?</seg>
<seg id="15">"I guess already," he says.</seg>
<seg id="16">I have about 3.000 or 4.000 plates.</seg>
<seg id="17">These records, shown above (he sent me the snapshot by e-mail, I didn't follow him at home), dress up the walls of his living room.</seg>
<seg id="18">The reason why he has such a vast number of albums and singles is the result of his disposable income: he is now able to buy records he could not afford to buy and to buy items that he sold when he was young and plagued.</seg>
<seg id="19">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "many things I buy are from the late 60s, early 70s, which appeared when I was 11 or 12. things in which I was probably something too young to buy them," "" "" "" "he says." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="20">He agrees that those who buy records are rather introverted and like to spend time alone, adding: "I don't smoke and I don't drink much.</seg>
<seg id="21">This is my vice.</seg>
<seg id="22">WEZ, 25, who works with Sister Ray, also believes that many customers he meets YouGov profile.</seg>
<seg id="23">However, he has also noticed a new wave of people who are influenced by the media puppy, people who have heard about comeback and get to buy their old records.</seg>
<seg id="24">From the conversations I have led, people usually get rid of their collection so around 1998 or 1999.</seg>
<seg id="25">Customers who once sold their records to buy CDs now sell their CDs to buy their records, "he says.</seg>
<seg id="26">This would explain the boom to trailers of the record pitch of a certain age.</seg>
<seg id="27">But what about the alleged emotional meaning of records?</seg>
<seg id="28">It takes only a few seconds in a shop like Phonica to realize that record stores offer a soothing community of like-minded people.</seg>
<seg id="29">According to WEZ, some of the older customers impacted the contactless payment system.</seg>
<seg id="30">Some plate fans feel overwhelmed by the digital world and want to withdraw to the stability of familiar vinyl covers, from objects that are awakening lucky youth memories.</seg>
<seg id="31">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "I think sometimes it can be the filling of emptiness or possession of material possessions as a kind of comfort," "" "" "" "says WEZ." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="32">This is the case with me as a collector and I think it is so with many people.</seg>
<seg id="33">It is a simple way to mentally engage oneself.</seg>
<seg id="34">"we are like their social workers!" an employee flirts from a record stack.</seg>
<seg id="35">A survey by ICM in April revealed that almost 50% of people who bought a record last month have not yet listened.</seg>
<seg id="36">The survey also found that 41% have a record player they never use, while 7% of those who buy a record have no record player.</seg>
<seg id="37">At this time of the news report I would probably look very worried as I smoother through a pile of Bossa Nova compilations.</seg>
<seg id="38">Jonny, 42, who works at Sounds of the Universe (Number of records: three middle aged men) has noticed a "trophy aspect" of the Revival.</seg>
<seg id="39">"someone recently came in here and said," I don't own a record player, but I would like to buy a Radiohead pod, so that I can put it on the shelf, "he says.</seg>
<seg id="40">This is not a big percentage, but it definitely happens.</seg>
<seg id="41">More productive, less music-class.</seg>
<seg id="42">"" "" "" "we have people who say:" "" "" "" "I don't have a record player." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="43">These are younger people, not older ones, who only slowly get in.</seg>
<seg id="44">Fopp, which has devoted the sound panels to almost a whole floor, has a blower audience when I go in.</seg>
<seg id="45">There are couples around the 70, tourists who make photos, teenage boys and middle-aged women.</seg>
<seg id="46">Even if the atmosphere is somewhat less relaxed than in the above-mentioned shops - Wild Beast's newest synthesizer and sextpacket pop instead of experimental jazz sounds from the loudspeakers - it is good to see such a diversity among the customers.</seg>
<seg id="47">No one of them looks very lonely, but next psychic traumas are hard to find when standing next to someone 30 seconds long.</seg>
<seg id="48">Elanora, 27, runs around in the shop for a few minutes and looks at the variety of records available for sale.</seg>
<seg id="49">It is more of a window-shopping than a wholesale shopping.</seg>
<seg id="50">It doesn't deserve much, so collecting records is not a real option, says it.</seg>
<seg id="51">It costs a lot.</seg>
<seg id="52">It is easy to hear music from a computer or any other way, but the beauty of records is... "it drives with a loving sigh.</seg>
<seg id="53">I don't know how to explain it - it's really unique.</seg>
<seg id="54">My last stop is a business that is said to have inspired a new generation of record lovers: urban outfitters.</seg>
<seg id="55">While I appear to be wearing jeans hot pants, I watch a group of young teenage girls who are grouping for a moment around Polaroid cameras before a father and his daughter are considering buying a crosley record player.</seg>
<seg id="56">On the left is a staircase, a wall full of panels of Adele, Jeff Buckley, Amy Winehouse and Fleetwood Mac: a mixture of contemporary music and classics, the essential plates for an average collection.</seg>
<seg id="57">No one looks at them - maybe because they are only purely decorative, some so far up that it is impossible to touch them.</seg>
<seg id="58">It is pure "plate art."</seg>
<seg id="59">But considering that any attraction for these items imply more money for the industry and some customers could send to the depths of Soho for more, there is nothing to complain about.</seg>
<seg id="60">It is no surprise that a population group, which has more time and money than others, is also the one that is most suitable for luxury items such as records.</seg>
<seg id="61">Even if my research showed that the results of YouGov are right, they, at least in record stores in Soho, let the large number of female collectors exist, who exist in the reality, record stores and online forums.</seg>
<seg id="62">These people are probably working hard at school or in offices.</seg>
<seg id="63">They spend their Thursday mornings with security not by biting the tops of Berwick Street and the sheets through sheets while they steer clear of an uncanny, 30-year-old fake moderator, who raises nothing of middle-aged men over the shoulders.</seg>

<seg id="2">A French court rejected a quote from the authorities in Calais, dozens of temporary shops and restaurants in the jungle of Calais, where thousands of refugees live.</seg>
<seg id="3">During a court hearing this week, the authorities in Calais argued that the state should be authorised to sell 72 temporary shops in which individuals within the camp sell goods, cigarettes to energy drinks, sell hairdressing services, or sell tea for 50 cents (40 pence) or simple meals for a few euros in temporary restaurants.</seg>
<seg id="4">The prefecture of Calais argued that these places were to be dragged down because they would represent a parallel economy from which no taxes would be paid and which would have a risk of fire and sickness.</seg>
<seg id="5">Humanitarian groups told the court that the shops and restaurants were important as the free meals offered by the state-assisted union and other groups would not provide enough food for the growing numbers in the camp.</seg>
<seg id="6">They also suggested that the temporary shops and restaurants would often offer accommodation and free meals for people in need.</seg>
<seg id="7">A court in Lille decided that there would be no legal basis for expulsion of people who run the 72 temporary businesses, but admitted that the concerns of the prefecture of Calais were absolutely comprehensible. "</seg>
<seg id="8">Judge Jean-François Molla said that grocery stores, cafes and restaurants would play a much greater role than to feed only people living in extremely precarious conditions. "</seg>
<seg id="9">He said that the areas offer quiet meeting points between refugees and volunteers.</seg>
<seg id="10">One of the places that was threatened by the tearing was the Jungle Book Kids' café of the camp, which is operated in a community and offers 200 meals a day, English and French classes as well as advice on asylum cases for the hundreds of vulnerable, unaccompanied minors in the camp.</seg>
<seg id="11">More than 170,000 people signed the petition to preserve the Kids' Café.</seg>

<seg id="3">The futuristic Enforcement Trailer from Vitronic from Wiesbaden, for example, can be used at accident areas where it would be too dangerous for a mobile measurement by the police.</seg>
<seg id="4">For example, on motorway construction sites or to sandy bridges with temporary speed polishes there is often no necessary infrastructure to ensure that there is a stationary blitz to ensure compliance with the speed limit.</seg>

<seg id="6">The Enforcement Trailer is self-sufficient: its battery lasts five days with uninterrupted measurement operation, the case data is transmitted encrypted via a modem.</seg>
<seg id="7">Laser measurement technology can also detect all vehicles across multiple tracks simultaneously.</seg>
<seg id="8">Variable speed limits as well as drive-through bans by time, travel strips and vehicle class can also be monitored.</seg>
<seg id="9">According to the manufacturer, the trailer can be moved by car with trailer hitch.</seg>

<seg id="2">Britain's impressive performance at 7-7 rugby came to an abrupt halt in the finale on Thursday evening in the form of Fijis when they were hit here in Rio with a result of 43-7 at the final stage.</seg>
<seg id="3">Fiji raised a master class in handling, side-stepping, back, line and raw power to gain gold - their first Olympic medal of any colour.</seg>
<seg id="4">The defeat was defeated by the not too bad silver medal - Britain's fourth on that day - and they could be proud of their efforts in this tournament in which they beat New Zealand, Argentina and South Africa.</seg>
<seg id="5">The clear defeat of the Boks, 7-5 in the semifinals the same day could fall back to them in the final.</seg>
<seg id="6">But apart from that, Fiji might have beaten a 15-man-team in this form.</seg>
<seg id="7">It could be a consolation for GB - but probably it won't - that at least a Briton tomorrow will hang a gold medal around his neck: Fijis boss coach Ben Ryan, former boss for England from Wimbledon.</seg>
<seg id="8">GB had a difficult path.</seg>
<seg id="9">Eight years ago, Ryan lost every game with the Adelaide Sevens.</seg>
<seg id="10">Here they lost only one.</seg>
<seg id="11">This hatch will hurt, but progress is amazing.</seg>
<seg id="12">Fiji started wondering and let the attacks bring GBs out of fun.</seg>
<seg id="13">It felt for Captain Tom Mitchell and Co. as if they were running in running buses. the World Series winners went 5-0 upwards, as Osea Kolinisau frosted in the corner.</seg>
<seg id="14">With four minutes of playing, Jerry Tuwai added another attack from the right-hand corner.</seg>
<seg id="15">12-0 and GB hardly touched the ball.</seg>
<seg id="16">A Tackle Tackle from Mitchell stopped the mountain of man Leone Nakarawa open a third gate, but Fiji only stopped.</seg>
<seg id="17">In the seventh minute Athena Veremalua found a touch-down in the right corner and it was 0-17 for GB.</seg>
<seg id="18">Nakarawa added a new member since the reunion and there was still a minute of playing... in the first half.</seg>
<seg id="19">Vatemo Ravouvou pressured by further weak Tacklings of the GB team and stormed up to the line to make a gate.</seg>
<seg id="20">The conversion brought a 29-0 to a break.</seg>
<seg id="21">It is like Fiji was born to play 7, while GB is still learning.</seg>
<seg id="22">This is how it is.</seg>
<seg id="23">GB introduced fundamental changes to half-time and closed the fijian gap... for a total of four minutes, which was good for the conditions of the first half-time until Joshua went through Tuisova after a brilliant intermediate play of Fiji.</seg>
<seg id="24">Dan Norton launched an attempt for GB, made a touch-down in the left corner for a 36-7, but the game went for a long time in favour of the South Sea sulphide, whose fans sang, wave flags and danced on the tribune.</seg>
<seg id="25">It was not difficult to admire the playful approach Fijis.</seg>
<seg id="26">Mata Viliame put the icing on the cake with another attempt in the last few seconds.</seg>
<seg id="27">The whiff was crowned, the Fijis hugged and the Great Britain kicked in the lawns.</seg>
<seg id="28">Earlier on the day Fiji had defeated Japan in semi-finals with 20-5 and Britain pressed South Africa in a tight half-finalmatch from the race - Great Britain's conversion of the difference.</seg>
<seg id="29">Kyle Brown introduced the Boks in the first half to the front, but Dan Norton left the line with an impressive footwork and scored a gate among the posts in the second half.</seg>
<seg id="30">A brilliant late Tackling by Marcus Watson, the brother of Anthony of the English 15-Aside Team, secured winning - and thus the silver medal.</seg>

<seg id="2">There will be no more emotic gold than with these games, and that will mean what is to be called.</seg>
<seg id="3">From the first stroke to the last 220 hard Hieve, which enter the story, Helen Glover and Heather Stanning found an additional meaning in their golden moment at the Estacio da Lagoa.</seg>
<seg id="4">Even if there were only those who were sitting at the helm, there were three voices in the boat. the echo of the trainer Robin Williams, was omnipresent when they rowed to the second Olympiagold in the second without a tax-woman, the first women in the history of British sports who put on such a scale.</seg>
<seg id="5">Her dominance was absolute, after all her 39.th unruined bet, which is also unparalleled.</seg>
<seg id="6">What we see are two brilliant athletins floating over the surface with the elegance of swans, which does not reflect the type of triumphal goose.</seg>
<seg id="7">Behind every gold in the rowing, there is a battalion of willing helpers who contribute to incremental advances that make the difference and no one was more helpful than the coach who did not know whether he would survive this day at all when he was diagnosed with cancer.</seg>
<seg id="8">As he said, he risked.</seg>
<seg id="9">I had bladder cancer that is operable and that they did.</seg>
<seg id="10">If you do not, it spreads everywhere.</seg>
<seg id="11">It would have been a rather bad situation.</seg>

<seg id="3">"" "" "" "the association is regarded as" "" "" "" "Bavarian far exemplary." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="4">A small Franconian drinking water-purpose association as a model for large water producers.</seg>

<seg id="7">"" "" "" "the work of the" "" "" "" "Veitenstein" "" "" "" "group was" "" "" "" "Bavaria far as exemplary." "" "" "" "" "" "" "</seg>
<seg id="8">Behind all this stands Rupert Göller, who was 31 years in the Confederation of Employees, 28 of whom served as Managing Director.</seg>
<seg id="9">Now he was retired at the age of 65.</seg>
<seg id="10">The drinking water-purpose association of the Veitenstein group, based in Kottendorf, municipality of Breitbrunn, promotes annually about 150000 cubic meters of water and supplies 32 places and hamlets with approximately 5500 inhabitants.</seg>
<seg id="11">The municipalities are the communes of Kirchloubrunn, Breitbrunn, Lauter, Ebelsbach and the town of Baunach.</seg>
<seg id="12">There are water supply contracts for other towns and municipalities.</seg>
<seg id="13">The current chairman, Breitbrunn Bürgermeisterei Gertrud Bühl (FW), recalled that Rupert Göller was appointed a water-keeper in 1985 and was appointed Managing Director of the ZweckAssociation in 1988.</seg>
<seg id="14">"his duties have been very diverse and they extended from water management and maintenance to office and organizational activities, budget planning, calculation of fees and contributions to emergency interventions at weekends," said the chairman.</seg>
<seg id="15">As an outstanding event, she called the start-up and inauguration of the new fountain (1994), land purchases in the area of the new fountain (1998) and compensation of farmers, the reconstruction of the high tanks (1999), the repurchase of a central computer control system (2004) and the partial renewal of water pipes.</seg>
<seg id="16">There has never been any downtime, and there has always been new additions, because water is living and drinking water is the most important food.</seg>
<seg id="17">In her laudatio, she praised Göllers loyal, reliable and correct service over 31 years.</seg>
<seg id="18">He has used a lot of heart blood for his water-purpose association and he regulated the water-purpose association, as if it were his own company.</seg>
<seg id="19">A few weeks ago, as a real practitioner, he was allowed to present the successful concept of the Veitenstein Group for nitrate reduction in front of the water forum of the Lower Franconia district.</seg>
<seg id="20">For this he received a lot of praise and praise.</seg>
<seg id="21">Rupert Göller, on his part, praised Alfons Griebel, who worked with him for 28 years.</seg>
<seg id="22">He is the best water-goer and he was a faithful boy.</seg>
<seg id="23">Together we were an unbeatable team.</seg>
<seg id="24">As high points from his point of view, he described the well construction and the restructuring of the purpose association.</seg>
<seg id="25">But the biggest challenge and the most difficult task, however, were the pipe burst at the high container near Kirchner on a third of January.</seg>
<seg id="26">Here we had to work at minus 17 degrees all night so that the villages could be supplied with water.</seg>
<seg id="27">Also the supply of Neubrunn can only be maintained, because one filled the high canister of Pettstadt with hoses.</seg>
<seg id="28">The management of the drinking water utility association was handed over to Daniel Stürmer from Lauter, who succeeds Rupert Göller.</seg>

<seg id="1">Steel - Lichtblick for the German Steel Industry</seg>
<seg id="2">The crisis-packed and energy-intensive German steel industry remains unaffected by additional costs in millions of euros.</seg>
<seg id="3">Financial burdens arising from the sector of green electricity production are from the table.</seg>
<seg id="4">The German Federal Minister for Economic Affairs, Sigmar Gabriel (SPD), said the "West German Allgemeine Zeitung" (WAZ, Friday edition) at the release of the Renewable Energy Supplement in the existing plants for the so-called self-current production in the German steel industry.</seg>
<seg id="5">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "I'm really happy that we could finally reach this after two years of tough negotiations." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="6">The European Commission therefore initially planned to ask the steel producers to use the gas from the blast furnace to generate electricity for their own consumption.</seg>
<seg id="7">According to the German industry association, the steel industry has threatened additional costs of 120 to 240 million euros a year.</seg>
<seg id="8">Gabriel said the WAZ, there is now a basic agreement with the European Commission for talks with Commissioner Margrethe Vestager.</seg>
<seg id="9">Only when the generators are replaced in the steel plants, an EEG reserve of 20 percent would fall.</seg>
<seg id="10">But even this is not raised in the steel industry.</seg>
<seg id="11">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "IG Metall welcomed Germany's agreement with the European Commission on self-electricity generation." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="12">As a result, the status quo is largely dictated by the current regulation.</seg>
<seg id="13">Gabriel's successful effort for the steel industry is of particular importance.</seg>
<seg id="14">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "in view of our" "" "" "" "Steel is Future" campaign is this a first step. "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "</seg>

<seg id="16">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "even in the reform of emission trading trade, climate and employment targets must be weighed down," "" "" "" "stated IG Metall CEO Jörg Hofmann in Frankfurt." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="17">Since the financial crisis in 2008, the steel industry in Europe has been suffering from overcapacity and considerable price pressure.</seg>
<seg id="18">Last year, the situation continued to aggravate when the world's largest producer of producers threw steel on the world market in view of the weakening domestic demand.</seg>
<seg id="19">European manufacturers accuse Chinese steel companies price dumping.</seg>
<seg id="20">In the course of this spring, the situation has eased a little.</seg>
<seg id="21">On the one hand, imported import duties on import-steel have effect, on the other hand, the economic prospects in China have brightened.</seg>
<seg id="22">It is not clear how sustainable the price collection is.</seg>
<seg id="23">The German industry leader Thyssenkrupp was cautious on Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="24">Last but not least the prices would have stagnated more.</seg>
<seg id="25">The industry responds to the difficult situation with further cost reductions.</seg>
<seg id="26">At last, ThyssenKrupp did not want to exclude certain closures of individual works.</seg>
<seg id="27">At the end of 2015, some 8,000 people were employed in the German steel industry.</seg>
<seg id="28">In July, the German steel manufacturers are cautious despite rising prices and increasing orders.</seg>
<seg id="29">At 3.4 million tonnes, they produced a good six percent less crude steel than the previous year's month, as the Steel Community announced on Friday.</seg>
<seg id="30">After a short increase in May, the quantity produced was returned to the second month.</seg>
<seg id="31">Since the beginning of the year, production has been around two percent lower than the previous year's figure.</seg>
<seg id="32">In the coming months, the association expects an improved order situation with increasing output.</seg>

<seg id="1">Community, mind, health: singing does seniors good</seg>
<seg id="2">The singing has accompanied Ursel Kipp all her life: as a young girl she was in the school choir, in the Magisterium course she occupied the subject of music, and today the 78-year-old sings in a seniors choir.</seg>
<seg id="3">"singing moves me - emotionally and physically," she describes.</seg>
<seg id="4">After a rehearsal, she feels balanced, cheerful and more alive, she says.</seg>
<seg id="5">By the way, she does something good in her health and mind.</seg>
<seg id="6">Because singing is a great hobby for seniors from several perspectives, says Erhard Hackler from the German senior league.</seg>
<seg id="7">Most seniors sing in the choir and share with like-minded people the joy of music, describes Hackler.</seg>
<seg id="8">Through regular meetings, seniors can socialize and maintain social contacts.</seg>
<seg id="9">Because often social and family structures dissolve in old age, a choir is then an ideal opportunity to spend time with other people.</seg>
<seg id="10">This experience has also made Ursel Kipp in her choir: "to talk and organise, to be able to rely on others and to learn from each other - a choir is a very special form of being together."</seg>
<seg id="11">Singing can be exhausting in the positive sense, says Hackler.</seg>
<seg id="12">For doing so, seniors train a deep and controlled breathing.</seg>
<seg id="13">Those who regularly demand their lungs are not so fast in everyday life.</seg>
<seg id="14">Even if it is about getting the sound of the voice in old age, singing is an optimal hobby.</seg>
<seg id="15">For older people, Singen often has a very special effect, says Ursula Lenz from the Federal Association of Seniors.</seg>
<seg id="16">In the older generations the common singing had a much higher value, it belonged to everyday life, both in school and in leisure, it explains.</seg>
<seg id="17">Lenz often observes that singing or listening to songs in elderly people awakens many memories, often associated with positive feelings of their youth.</seg>
<seg id="18">Through lyrics and especially melodies, dementia-sick people decompose to long-lying events.</seg>
<seg id="19">While singing, a special achievement is demanded to the head, explains Lenz.</seg>
<seg id="20">To concentrate simultaneously on one's own voice and to a given rhythm and adapt to the other singers - this is a major cognitive challenge.</seg>
<seg id="21">Just older people who live alone are doing so not only to concentrate on themselves.</seg>
<seg id="22">Another positive aspect is the recognition that one learns through singing in the choir, says Hackler.</seg>
<seg id="23">An enthusiastic audience is a great praise.</seg>
<seg id="24">The self-esteem also grows through singing in the choir.</seg>
<seg id="25">To show yourself: if I practise for something long, I get better and grow beyond me - this experience strengthens.</seg>
<seg id="26">Good reasons to start singing, so there is enough.</seg>
<seg id="27">Those who want to try out a new hobby should not hesitate - even if he thinks he has little talent, Lenz advises.</seg>
<seg id="28">You don't sing alone - with 50 singing people, who hears when a ton goes beside it?</seg>
<seg id="29">In search of the right offer, seniors have different options, says Hackler.</seg>
<seg id="30">If someone sings from the circle of acquaintance in a senior choir, you can simply join.</seg>
<seg id="31">Many cities also offer views of the choirs in the surroundings.</seg>
<seg id="32">Those who want to sing in a church choir can turn directly to the church or the church leader.</seg>
<seg id="33">Many senior choirs can also be found on the internet.</seg>
<seg id="34">Anyone who has no access to the Internet can ask the family, friends or neighbours for help in the internet research.</seg>
<seg id="35">Those who want to sing should definitely join a choir, advises Hackler.</seg>
<seg id="36">Singing does the soul good and has something liberating - that is true for all ages.</seg>

<seg id="2">Biologists have investigated in Hanover what effect the calls of cat babies have on adult animals.</seg>
<seg id="3">To their surprise, also the males did not leave the males cold - however they always behaved in the difference to the females always the same.</seg>
<seg id="4">Female cats can recognize the degree of regression of cat babies at the sight of the little ones.</seg>
<seg id="5">They react by ten percent faster to sounds of kittens who are in great need, as scientists have found out from the Veterinary Academy and the Hannover Medical School (MHH).</seg>
<seg id="6">Males also react to the calls of kittens - however always the same.</seg>
<seg id="7">"obviously the acoustic differences between the michewing of less and strongly excited young for the males are either not perceptible or not of significance," said the biologist Wiebke Konerding from the MHH.</seg>
<seg id="8">She is the first author of the study published on this Friday in the journal "BMC Evolutionary Biology."</seg>
<seg id="9">In a previous investigation, the research team had already found out that the duration and pitch of the kittens cries differed with the urgency of their neediness.</seg>
<seg id="10">Nine adult males and eight female kittens were observed from the animal husbandry of the MHH.</seg>
<seg id="11">They were played for a reputations of little ones, taken from the litter box for three minutes and separated from mother and siblings.</seg>
<seg id="12">On the other hand, they were confronted with cries of more excited kittens, which were raised in addition.</seg>
<seg id="13">Despite the small sample of the sample, the researchers keep their results meaningful.</seg>
<seg id="14">"all the females, even those who have not had their own offspring, reacted differentiated to the screams," Konerding said.</seg>
<seg id="15">They turned around faster to the loudspeaker, when this calls played out the very excited kittens.</seg>
<seg id="16">This ability may possibly be innate or develop with sexual maturity.</seg>
<seg id="17">"a surprise was that the males did react at all," said the biologist.</seg>
<seg id="18">In the past, scientists have repeatedly examined the reactions of women and men to baby noises in humans.</seg>
<seg id="19">Some studies showed that women reacted more sensitively to babies, regardless of whether they were already mothers or not, told the biologist Marina Scheumann.</seg>

<seg id="2">The Austrian Embassy in Thailand is in contact with the woman, said the spokesman of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Thomas Schnöll, Friday.</seg>
<seg id="3">She suffered injuries and had been treated in the hospital, but I have already left it.</seg>
<seg id="4">She planned her home trip for the beginning of September.</seg>
<seg id="5">Whether the further explosions on the holiday island of Phuket as well as in the southern cities of Surat Thani, Phang Nga, Trang and Chumphon are also Austrian citizens, be unclear for the time being.</seg>
<seg id="6">The Ministry of Foreign Affairs is in constant contact with the local authorities.</seg>
<seg id="7">Hua Hin, located approximately 200 kilometres south of Bangkok's capital, were initially exploded by two bombs on Thursday evening.</seg>
<seg id="8">According to the police, a Thai woman was killed and about 20 people were injured, including the Austrian, three Germans, three Dutch and three Italians.</seg>
<seg id="9">Friday morning two explosives went up again, and another person was killed according to the authorities.</seg>
<seg id="10">Also from Phuket a bomb explosion was reported in the morning.</seg>
<seg id="11">A taxi driver was injured in the detonation in the vicinity of the popular bathing beach in Patong.</seg>
<seg id="12">In Surat Thani on the south-east coast of the country another bomb exploded, killing an urban clerk.</seg>
<seg id="13">According to the authorities in a flower beet, the explosive device went into the air in front of the territory of the coastal police.</seg>
<seg id="14">Finally, detonations in Phang Nga and Trang on the south-west coast as well as in Chumphon on the south-eastern coast demanded several injuries.</seg>
<seg id="15">It was said that there was a connection with the explosions in Hua Hin.</seg>
<seg id="16">"the bomb attacks carry the same manuscript," said Army general Danai Kritamavee Friday morning to journalists.</seg>
<seg id="17">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "we assume that this is a coordinated attack." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="18">It is too early to manifest themselves as possible motives, but it is likely to be the acts of Muslim rebels.</seg>
<seg id="19">Thai media also wanted to recognize a pattern typical of the bombings of Muslim separatists in the south of the country.</seg>
<seg id="20">The Thai police, on the other hand, declared that the attacks were not in connection with the Islamist insurrectionary movement or with international terrorism.</seg>
<seg id="21">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "this is only local sabotage which is limited to limited areas and provinces," "" "" "" "said a spokesman in Bangkok." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="22">Rather, it is assumed that the bombs were placed by opponents of the ruling military junta.</seg>
<seg id="23">In the past few days, the authorities would have kept secret indications of imminent attacks in the south of the country - however, they were not informed about the exact time and places.</seg>
<seg id="24">It is still unclear which group is behind the attacks.</seg>
<seg id="25">The police put their officials across the country to enhance security around important government buildings as well as airports, train stations, tourist attractions, restaurants and entertainment districts.</seg>
<seg id="26">In Thailand there are again and again smaller bombings, but mostly do not address tourists.</seg>
<seg id="27">In Hua Hin is a palace that was used over the years by Thailand's King Bhumibol Adulyadej.</seg>
<seg id="28">After the bomb explosions, the Austrian Ministry of Foreign Affairs strongly recommends that the Thai security authorities follow the instructions of the Thai security authorities.</seg>
<seg id="29">High security risk (security level 3) applies to the provinces of Narathiwat, Yala, Pattani and Songhkla as well as Preah Vihear and its surroundings.</seg>
<seg id="30">After confrontations between security forces and Muslim populations, not necessary trips to these provinces will be discouraged.</seg>
<seg id="31">Increased security risk (security level 2) applies to the rest of the country.</seg>
<seg id="32">The attacks on Thursday and Friday took place a few days after a controversial referendum on a constitution drafted by the military junta.</seg>
<seg id="33">This gives the military great influence over the coming years.</seg>
<seg id="34">Junta CEO and Prime Minister Prayut Chan-o-cha said that the bombs were an attempt to foment chaos while the country moves toward stability, improving economic conditions and tourism.</seg>
<seg id="35">The military unta, which had seized power in 2014 after a period of bloody turmoil, will benefit herself to restore the kingdom again to stability and order.</seg>
<seg id="36">However, the military has not managed to get a grip on the revolting insurgency of Muslim rebels for years in the extreme south of the country.</seg>
<seg id="37">More than 6500 people have already been killed in the conflict.</seg>
<seg id="38">Almost a year ago, in Bangkok, 20 people were killed in a stop by a popular Hindu shrine - most of them foreign tourists.</seg>
<seg id="39">It was the bloodiest stop of the recent history of the country.</seg>

<seg id="2">Not always the Olympians or world records determine the headlines at the Olympic Games.</seg>
<seg id="3">This shows the bold show of Robel Kirill: at the summer games in Rio de Janeiro.</seg>
<seg id="4">In the Aquatics Center the slightly overlapping swimmers from Ethiopia slowly swam so slowly that it was no longer seen in the TV pictures.</seg>
<seg id="5">He simply disappeared - no matter how far the detail was chosen.</seg>
<seg id="6">Then, in the social networks, Habte became the viral interim.</seg>
<seg id="7">In fact, the 24-year-old ended up with a gap of 48 seconds and finished the 59th position of 59 starters.</seg>
<seg id="8">But it was rather its not exactly sporty figure that attracted the attention of the international media.</seg>
<seg id="9">Why does the 24-year-old participate in the Olympics?</seg>
<seg id="10">The Ethiopian got a special start right from the international swimming association.</seg>
<seg id="11">This is distributed to make swimming in underrepresented countries more popular.</seg>
<seg id="12">Since most athletes are running in Ethiopia, I just wanted to do something different.</seg>

<seg id="15">Some media referred it as "roar of the whale."</seg>
<seg id="16">Based on a "well-being" the English tabloid "The Sun" made fun of him with "Dad Bod."</seg>
<seg id="17">His time, he only struck a minute and almost five seconds over the 100 meter free-style, played no role.</seg>
<seg id="18">Comparisons with "Eric the Eel" were also drawn.</seg>
<seg id="19">Eric Moussambani created media attention at the Olympic Games 2000 in Sydney.</seg>
<seg id="20">Unforgettable was the appearance of the swimming pool from Equatorial Guinea, when he had to compete in a pre-run over 100 m Freestyle alone.</seg>
<seg id="21">Moussambani was then fired frenetically at that time.</seg>
<seg id="22">The then 22-year-old learned to swim in front of Olympia eight months and had never completed such a long distance before the competition.</seg>

<seg id="1">The fees per cubic metre of wastewater amount to 3,44 instead of 2.10 euros for the sewage plant in Neudorf / Reuth / Welhahl 3.44 as from 1 October 2016; for Zultenberg / Lindenberg / Lopp 3,36 euros (currently 2.26 euros) and for Azendorf 3.64 euros (up to now 2.18 euros).</seg>
<seg id="2">At the plant in Azendorf, the waste water fee will be increased at the latest when appropriate improvement measures are necessary.</seg>
<seg id="3">After a long-term calculation, the waste water price in Azendorf will then be at 4.37 euros per cubic metre.</seg>
<seg id="4">As mayor Bernd Steinhäuser (CSU) reported, at the approval of the budget by the district office Kulmbach, Unterdeckungen had been established for these sewage systems.</seg>
<seg id="5">Due to legal foundations, the Kasendorf market is obliged to operate the facilities in a cost-covering manner.</seg>
<seg id="6">As of 1 October 2016, the citizens and the commercial and industrial companies from Welsh ahl, Neudorf, Reuth, Azendorf, Lopp, Lindenberg and Zultenberg will have to go deeper into the purse.</seg>
<seg id="7">Fee increases are between 48 and 67 percent.</seg>
<seg id="8">As Managing Director Herbert Schmidt presented the board, a new calculation of the fees for the wastewater facilities of the market community was necessary.</seg>
<seg id="9">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "in the period from October 2016 to September 2020, also over and over-covers from the previous calculation period are to be equated." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="10">The major rise in fees was based on the fact that all three wastewater facilities have relatively small facilities with a very low waste water intake, lying between 6800 and 12000 cubic meters per year.</seg>
<seg id="11">For example, due to the low distribution basis, expenses for necessary repairs of several thousand Euros would have a serious impact.</seg>
<seg id="12">In addition, the waste water volume in all three plants is slightly decreasing.</seg>
<seg id="13">Furthermore, due to their age renovation and repair costs, in the recumbent calcculation period, renovation and repair costs have fallen to a considerable extent.</seg>
<seg id="14">The plant in Azendorf is nearly 30 years old, the facilities for Welsh ahl, Neudorf and Reuth as well as Zultenberg, Lindenberg and Lopp almost 20 years.</seg>
<seg id="15">Schmidt showed that in the waste water system Azendorf the mechanical ventilation system had to be replaced because of damage.</seg>
<seg id="16">In the pumping station Welsh Steel, the almost 20-year-old conveyor systems had to be overhauled from the ground up and at the Lopp pond treatment plant, the first sewage sludge had to be discharged, the sewage sludge was disposed of and an additional ventilation option was installed in order to meet the requirements of the water legal requirements in the future.</seg>
<seg id="17">Schmidt: "these extraordinary expenses resulted in the continued care and maintenance costs, which must be taken into account in accordance with the new calculation period."</seg>
<seg id="18">The same applies to electricity costs, which were still considerably below the current level during the previous calculation in 2011 / 2012.</seg>
<seg id="19">Stone houses made it clear that in the case of low waste water in the three plants, the expenses for the operation and maintenance were "full."</seg>
<seg id="20">Schmidt, the market community of large entertainment costs in the waste water installations in the past 20 years has been spared.</seg>
<seg id="21">The situation for the mentioned plants will remain precarious in the opinion of stone houses in the long run, especially since the supply area of the Friesenbachtal sewage treatment association can not be extended because it is a deficit.</seg>

<seg id="1">Snapchat "Anime" -Effect criticized as an Asian caricature</seg>
<seg id="2">Snapchat says that this filter is anime-inspired, but some observers say it is insensitive to races.</seg>
<seg id="3">With its filter tool, Snapchat allows around 150 million daily users to change reality and play with identities in such a way that borders on the absurd.</seg>
<seg id="4">You can turn into a pineapple, a dog or a figure that could be from a Roy Lichtenstein painting.</seg>
<seg id="5">The filters are blunt, self-rotating tools that generate more than 30 million improved selfies per day.</seg>
<seg id="6">All miscarriage returns to the public.</seg>
<seg id="7">The Snapchat filters have been criticised in the past in which they were charged that the Blackface app would promote or propagate white skin as a beauty ideal.</seg>
<seg id="8">When this week proposed a filter to some users who gave them slit-eyes, false teeth and bloated cheeks, some critics called it a racist caricature of Asians - "yellow face."</seg>
<seg id="9">They wondered if these repeated controversies pointed to a greater problem that the company has diversity.</seg>
<seg id="10">The news and outrage were widespread on Wednesday, with reports from The Verge and Motherboard, a day after Snapchat announced that it would have deactivated the feature.</seg>
<seg id="11">The company offered an apology: the filter was intended as a tribute to anime characters and not as caricature of Asians.</seg>
<seg id="12">But outsiders who have experienced racism reminded the filter of vulnerable clichés.</seg>
<seg id="13">Others rejected the anime comparison.</seg>
<seg id="14">In an e-mail, Grace Sparapani, a Korean-American art student whose tweet over the photos has been widely publicized that the filter was "vulnerable and mildly said unpleasant."</seg>
<seg id="15">She added that "it is difficult to argue with the juxtaposition of a very disgusting Asian cartoonist and the filter effects.</seg>
<seg id="16">It shows that the filter is not yellow-protected, but that the yellow face was pulled into the flaring extreme.</seg>
<seg id="17">Snapchat is not the only company that crosses these cultural stumbling blocks.</seg>
<seg id="18">American culture seems to be involved in an endless diversity of diversity and integration, from conference rooms to Hollywood and devices that we all hold in hand.</seg>
<seg id="19">And Snapchats's great audience of young people - who are more versed in the breed than their older opponents - might expect to expect sensitivity.</seg>
<seg id="20">When one of Snapchats filters creates a picture that is insulting for a user, "it is much more difficult that such items remain unnoticed than it was before," said the 25-year-old Katie Zhu in an interview on Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="21">On Thursday Zhu, who worked as a product manager and engineer for medium, decided to erase her Snapchat account and asked others to do the same.</seg>
<seg id="22">In an essay for medium and in a telephone interview, she said she believes that racial controversies reflect a lack of diversity in the setting practices of Snapchat.</seg>
<seg id="23">Zhu critically criticized the white, only male leadership, and finished her essay with a hashtag: # DeleteSnapchat.</seg>
<seg id="24">"either they have no diverse representation of people with other skin colors in their staff so that they can make such decisions," said the Chinese Zhu, "or they have people with other skin colors that work there but are not in positions where they feel safe or comfortable to say about it."</seg>
<seg id="25">Others share their opinion, a complaint that has largely left Snapchat unanswered.</seg>
<seg id="26">The company does not publish figures on the diversity of its workforce and indicates its status as a private company.</seg>
<seg id="27">On Thursday, it rejected Snapchat to discuss the cultural background of its employees, but according to a spokesman, the company recently hired a personnel responsible focusing on underrepresented population groups and internal integration efforts.</seg>
<seg id="28">Zhu in turn said that she will have her Snapchat account closed and added, "I wonder if they need more users than us to say that it is not O.K.."</seg>

<seg id="1">Military leadership falsifies ISIS intelligence information, establishes committee of Congress</seg>
<seg id="2">Military personnel of the United States Central Command changed intelligence-to-order information in order to draw an optimistic picture of the war against the so-called Islamic State in Iraq and Syria when the actual conditions were allowed on site, an investigation committee of the Congress reported in a report on Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="3">The preliminary report, created by a Task Force of the republican members of the army committee, secret service committees, and the military budget, reports of great dissatisfaction among Central Command Secret Service analysts who reported how superiors changed their estimates to American efforts in the fight against the Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="4">The Central Command, short Cencom, is the military headquarters in Tampa, Florida, which controls the American military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia.</seg>
<seg id="5">"intelligence intelligence, typically inspired by high-ranking CentCom commanders, regularly recorded a positive image of US efforts against terrorism as it allowed the actual conditions on site and were consistently positive as analyses of other intelligence agencies," a newspaper article cited the report.</seg>
<seg id="6">"what happened at CentCom is unacceptable - our soldiers suffer if bad analyses are presented to our political leaders," Ken Calvert, a member of the House of Representatives, established.</seg>
<seg id="7">The management mistakes in the CentCom reach the top of the organization.</seg>
<seg id="8">The ten-page report shows detailed problems in the years 2014 and 2015 in the descriptions and analysis of American efforts in the formation of the Iraqi forces.</seg>
<seg id="9">Although there is no direct indication that government peaks under Obama have given instructions to change reports, it shows how analysts saw themselves exposed to pressure from their superiors, an optimistic picture of the threat of the Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL.</seg>
<seg id="10">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "during the first half of 2015, many Central Command Press Releases, comments and statements prior to the congress were much more positive than it corresponds to the facts" "" "" "". "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="11">For example, a CentCom member publicly announced that a military reconquest of Mossuls could begin in April or May 2015.</seg>
<seg id="12">Mosul, the second largest city in Iraq, remains under the control of the Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="13">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "after months of investigations, so much is clear." "" "" "" "said Mike Pompeo, Republican Congressman from Kansas, in a statement." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="14">From the middle of 2014 to the middle of 2015, the leaders of the Central Command changed the intelligence reports to play the threat of ISIS in Iraq.</seg>
<seg id="15">The Republicans called the Task Force to life after they were admitted that analysts were concerned about the manipulation of reports on the Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="16">The report published on Thursday will be completed by more detailed findings while the investigations are continued.</seg>
<seg id="17">In addition, further investigation of CentCom reports is underway due to the Chief Inspector of the Ministry of Defense.</seg>
<seg id="18">Democratic members of the Intelligence Committee published their own findings on Thursday that coincided with some of the conclusions of the Republican Task Force.</seg>
<seg id="19">"in 2014 and 2015, CentCom has created an excessively limited process for the creation of intelligence assessments of ISIL and the Iraqi security services," announced the highest level democrat in the committee, Member of the House of Representatives Adam B. Schiff, in a statement.</seg>
<seg id="20">"" "" "" "this process," "" "" "" "Mr Schiff," "" "" "" "delayed the publication of intelligence reports," "" "" "" "reported morals among analysts and" "" "" "" "gave too little space for divergent opinions." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="21">But Mr. Schiff and the Democrats gave no clues to the intervention of the White House at the CentCom analysts with regard to a "certain political opinion."</seg>
<seg id="22">The preliminary results of the investigation of the Congress were published on Tuesday by "The Daily Beast."</seg>
<seg id="23">Last August, the New York Times reported investigations by the Pentagon's general inspector, who were admitted to CentCom analysts "complaints.</seg>
<seg id="24">According to Cmdr. Patrick Evans, a Pentagon spokesman, stated in a statement that the Ministry of Defence would not comment on the Congress, while the investigations of the General Inspector are still under way.</seg>
<seg id="25">"" "" "" "but he also stated that" "" "" "" "experts can sometimes have divergent opinions about the interpretation of complex data and that the intelligence services and the Ministry of Defence welcome a controversial discussion of these important issues of national defence." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="26">The investigations have repercussions on the question of a successful air campaign led by American leadership in Iraq and Syria (an assertion that is now being made by a growing number of members of the Ministry of Defense).</seg>
<seg id="27">However, the allegations of last year raised the question to what extent President Obama can rely on Central Command for honest assessments of military operations in Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya and other crisis regions.</seg>
<seg id="28">The criticism of the secret information on the Islamic State recall feuds of more than ten years ago, as a CentCom analyst, Gregory Hooker, wrote a piece about how the then government under George W. Bush cautioned only a small occupation force in Iraq and had little time to think about the consequences of the invasion of 2003.</seg>
<seg id="29">Mr. Hooker also played a key role in revolt against the current coverage of the Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="30">Last year, the team headed by Mr. Hooker stated that contrary to the government's statements against the refineries held by the Islamic State, there were no significant effects on the financial situation of the terrorist group, since these temporary refineries had put into operation in order to sell oil on the black market.</seg>
<seg id="31">This recognition, however, was not published, reported the Times in September.</seg>
<seg id="32">Centcoms damal commander, Doctor Lloyd J. Austin III, was criticised by members of the legislature on his overly positive assessment of the situation at a hearing before the Senate.</seg>
<seg id="33">General Austin retired in April and was replaced at the Central Command by Gen. Joseph L. Votel.</seg>

<seg id="2">One day after having shot three goals during a 6-1 victory over Japan, Katie Bam also made the first two goals for the American field hockey team of women in a match on Thursday against India that the Americans won 3-0.</seg>
<seg id="3">Five goals in two games should actually be a memorable achievement, but Bam (27) said she couldn't remember that ever done.</seg>
<seg id="4">"I have no idea." she said.</seg>
<seg id="5">I am not among the people who keep their gates in memory.</seg>
<seg id="6">But she knows: the Americans are at 4-0 in the Olympic competition and are also in their group with the Britons in the first place, which after their 2-0 victory against Japan will remain undefeated.</seg>
<seg id="7">Great Britain and the United States will meet on Saturday in the final game of the first round.</seg>
<seg id="8">Both teams have already qualified for the quarter final, the game will decide which of the two teams will win the first and second place within their group of six teams.</seg>
<seg id="9">The first place will go slightly longer by the strong Dutch runners who lead the other group.</seg>
<seg id="10">Whatever the game takes place on Saturday, the Americans have triggered a surprising vortex through their success story, four years after they ended up at the last London Games on the last of 12 places.</seg>
<seg id="11">BAM was part of this team.</seg>
<seg id="12">She grew up in Blue Bell, Pennsylvania, and had the first time with three years a hockey club in her hands (her two older sisters played the sport at Drexel University), with 16 years she became national player of the USA, the youngest in the history of the team.</seg>

<seg id="14">Then came the year 2012 in which everything went wrong for her and her team.</seg>

<seg id="1">In the middle of the Rage of the Olympic Games, the zen of the trampoline</seg>
<seg id="2">Wherever you are, as late it is, it is the Olympic Games.</seg>
<seg id="3">The events in Rio de Janeiro feel constant and inevitable, a fast relay race between competition and aspiration.</seg>
<seg id="4">It is as if the olympic torch itself is a burning staff, which is passed by the wristband to the swimmer to the gymnast for triathletes.</seg>
<seg id="5">You can't turn on the TV, read a newspaper or listen to your neighbour's conversation in the coffee shop without listening to Simone Biles, Katie Lecovery or the fight between Michael Phelps and Chad le Clos.</seg>
<seg id="6">And then there is Logan Dooley.</seg>
<seg id="7">Dooley, who for the first time at the Olympic Games and a female swarm with dimples, could have been under these known names that were sent to Prime Time built by sponsors and feel-good TV advertising, if he were a swimmer, gymnast or even fencer.</seg>
<seg id="8">But Dooley, 28, from Lake Forest, California, fights for gold at Olympic trampolines.</seg>
<seg id="9">The Olympic flame does not illuminate any event.</seg>
<seg id="10">Further from the center, partly in the shadow are the sports that are not generally accepted: air gun shooting, archery, badminton, taekwondo.</seg>
<seg id="11">We will always have the breast-swimming and may it reign for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="12">But if I have modest arguments for my particular darling, let me draw attention to the discrete charm of the trampoline.</seg>
<seg id="13">Although the trampoline has been an Olympic event since 2000, when it had its debut in Sydney, the last 16 years have been so scarcely perceived that many of them, I had surveyed, did not know that it is an Olympic sport at all.</seg>
<seg id="14">This could also be regional ignorance.</seg>
<seg id="15">Although the USA sent athletes to competition, it has never won a medal in jumping on trampolines and had had an athlete until 2012 who made it up to the final round.</seg>
<seg id="16">The Chinese and the Russians are inclined to divide the prices for the men and the Chinese and the Canadian ones for the women.</seg>
<seg id="17">Dong Dong from China and Rosie MacLennan from Canada will defend their gold medal this year from London.</seg>
<seg id="18">The trampoline has a certain outsider charm, partly because it sounds suitable for the unenlightened ear for a clown school as the one for the Olympic Games.</seg>
<seg id="19">At this point I should admit that I am not an expert, but a devoted enthusiast.</seg>
<seg id="20">It has humorous potential - the cartoonous trembling of his never-ending impact - but also the Grazie of Turnout and Scuba Diving, the two sports that essentially unite.</seg>
<seg id="21">The word "trampoline" comes from the Spanish El Trampoline, which means as much as "stepping stone."</seg>
<seg id="22">Emerging winners jump on a giant trampoline, shoot almost up to 30 feet in the air and need a number of falling movements (turning, pike and saltos) before they land on the feet.</seg>
<seg id="23">According to the official Olympiad, they will be assessed according to performance, degree of difficulty and "flight time."</seg>
<seg id="24">Thirty-two athletes from 17 countries, 16 men and 16 women, will compete in Rio.</seg>
<seg id="25">The most common Olympic vector is straight ahead.</seg>
<seg id="26">Medallists have to go further, faster, up and down in their quest for gold, sometimes up to the finish, sometimes back and forth, up and down on the playground.</seg>
<seg id="27">They do not only hunt the finish line or the starting wall, but also a further highlight in television transmission: the world or the Olympiapord.</seg>
<seg id="28">The goal-oriented pursuit is nobel, admirable, even fanatic - and it is enough to even stir a viewer to tears.</seg>
<seg id="29">But it is also what I feel fatigued when watching these games.</seg>
<seg id="30">The trampoline offers a respite.</seg>
<seg id="31">The vector of the trampoline's jumper is above.</seg>
<seg id="32">A forward movement is not the goal.</seg>
<seg id="33">He or she bounces off, seemingly weightless like an astronaut, goes up, then down, then effortlessly back up.</seg>
<seg id="34">There is also a competition, of course not without difficulty, but during the exercise there is no hectic attack on the goal, no wolves into the distance, only the dreamy, elegant lifting of time and gravity.</seg>
<seg id="35">It is so Zen like the competition in the Olympic Games can only be.</seg>
<seg id="36">The women's qualification and final rounds will take place on Friday afternoon, in streaming at 13.00 Eastern Time; the men on Saturday also around 13.00.</seg>
<seg id="37">NBC will radiate the final rounds as part of an afternoon block from 14.00 on both days.</seg>
<seg id="38">In the midst of the Olympia Mania they promise a quiet, nice moment, one that is probably overlooked in the general tumult.</seg>
<seg id="39">If the increase in consciousness can only be achieved by the fear and objectification of male athletes - as the male US-Turner proposed recently - according to the Wall Street Journal - then Mr. Dooley anticipates his new fan community.</seg>

<seg id="1">"one generation protests" in Ethiopia, Long an ally of the US</seg>
<seg id="2">Violent protests in Ethiopia</seg>
<seg id="3">Protesters calling for political changes in Ethiopia met with the government's violent resistance.</seg>
<seg id="4">Witnesses say that during the clashes with the police, umpteen protesters were killed during shootings.</seg>
<seg id="5">Is Ethiopia just going to collapse?</seg>
<seg id="6">In the last ten years, it was one of the most stable countries in Africa, a solid ally of the West with a fast growing economy.</seg>
<seg id="7">But in recent months, protests against the government shook the country and expanded into more and more areas.</seg>
<seg id="8">Last week thousands of people raged on the streets and demanded fundamental political changes.</seg>
<seg id="9">According to human rights organisations, the government's response was ruthless.</seg>
<seg id="10">Witnesses gave up that police fired and killed tens of unarmed demonstrators.</seg>
<seg id="11">In circulation videos about the protests, which are probably from the last or the beginning of this year, show how security people hit young people with sticks while they were forced to make a hand against a wall.</seg>
<seg id="12">The head of the UN Human Rights Authority is now calling for a detailed investigation.</seg>
<seg id="13">"it has always been difficult to keep this country together and in the future it will become even more difficult," said Rashid Abdi, the leader of the Horn of Africa of the International Crisis Group, a research group.</seg>
<seg id="14">Ethiopia is the most populous country in Africa and its stability is estimated by the West.</seg>
<seg id="15">American military and intelligence services work closely with the Ethiopians to fight terrorism across the region, especially in Somalia. only a few countries in Africa, if ever, receive so much Western help.</seg>
<seg id="16">Ethiopia's economy expanded at a considerable pace.</seg>
<seg id="17">Its infrastructure has improved drastically - there is a new commuter train in the capital Addis Ababa.</seg>
<seg id="18">The roads are usually quiet, safe and clean.</seg>
<seg id="19">Even if Ethiopia was anything but a model for democracy - human rights organizations continued to suppress oppression by the government - the opposition in the country was restricted, with dissidents effectively silenced.</seg>
<seg id="20">Many were sent to exile or in prison, killed or driven to the deserts of the desert.</seg>
<seg id="21">But that could change.</seg>
<seg id="22">"if you suppress people and they have no other options except to protest, it breaks out," said Seyoum Teshome, a lecturer in Central Asia.</seg>
<seg id="23">The whole youth protests.</seg>
<seg id="24">A generation protests.</seg>
<seg id="25">There are numerous complaints that cover everything from land use to stranglehold in relation to the power of the ruling coalition.</seg>
<seg id="26">After a widely criticized election last year, the ruling party and its allies received the last seat of the opposition and now control 100 percent of the parliament.</seg>
<seg id="27">At the same time, tension rises along the border with Eritrea; a struggle for this jagged, controversial line demanded hundreds of lives in June.</seg>
<seg id="28">Analysts fear that separatists like the Oromo Liberation Front or the National Liberation Front of the Ogaden, which have been forced more or less in recent years, could use the turbulence and rearm themselves.</seg>
<seg id="29">Several factors explain why feelings of bitterness explode after years of before Hinköchelns below the surface.</seg>
<seg id="30">The first seems to be harmless: smartphones.</seg>
<seg id="31">Only in recent years, very many Ethiopians have been able to communicate with the social media because cheaper smartphones have become more and more frequent and the internet services improved.</seg>
<seg id="32">Even if the government blocks access to Facebook and Twitter, which it does at regular intervals, especially in protests, many people can still communicate via internet proxies hiding where they are.</seg>
<seg id="33">Several young Ethiopians gave an indication that they gathered to protest.</seg>
<seg id="34">The second factor is that there is more solidarity between the Oromos and Amharas, the two largest ethnicities in Ethiopia.</seg>
<seg id="35">The Oromos and Amharas are not natural enemies.</seg>
<seg id="36">For eons the Amharas, who come from Ethiopia's predominantly Christian highlands, prospered in politics and economy, while they exploited the Oromos, of which many Muslims are and live in lowland areas.</seg>
<seg id="37">But this too is changing.</seg>
<seg id="38">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "we are here to coordinate under one umbrella," "" "" "" "said Mulatu Gemechu, a leader of the Oromos." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="39">The biggest protests took place in areas of Amhara and Oromos.</seg>
<seg id="40">Many Amharas and Oromos feel that Ethiopia is inadequately dominated by members of the ethnic group of Tigray who account for about 6 percent of the population and are dominant in the military, intelligence services, trade and politics.</seg>
<seg id="41">The third reason for the unrest is the death of Meles Zenawi.</seg>
<seg id="42">Mr. Meles, a former rebel leader, was Ethiopian Prime Minister for 17 years until his death in a non-publicized disease in 2012.</seg>
<seg id="43">He was seen as a tactical genius, a man who could think of corners.</seg>
<seg id="44">Analysts say that he was particularly well versed in perceiving early signs of discontent and using special appointees to process opponents and make them harmless.</seg>
<seg id="45">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "the present regime lacks this fundamental skill," "" "" "" "said Mr Abdi, a conflict analyst." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="46">Ethiopia's new prime minister, Hailemariam Desalegn, was chosen for relatively untransparent reasons to take the position of Mr Meles.</seg>
<seg id="47">Unlike Mr Meles, who came from the Tigray region North Ethiopian, Mr. Hailemariam from the South comes.</seg>
<seg id="48">Analysts say that he does not enjoy the confidence of the security services controlled by the Tigray.</seg>
<seg id="49">Many fear that the result will be more bloodshed.</seg>
<seg id="50">The last time Ethiopia had experienced such a turmoil in 2005, after protesting thousands of elections, which, according to the statements of analysts, were apparently fed by the government and were then stolen.</seg>
<seg id="51">During the subsequent raids, many protesters were killed, even if they were less than in the last months and this time of turmoil passed relatively quickly.</seg>
<seg id="52">Development experts praised Ethiopia's leaders for their visionary infrastructure planning, such as the new commuter train, as well as for their measurable progress in fighting poverty.</seg>
<seg id="53">But obviously, this has not prevented the intensification of the internal misuse of the Ethiopian government.</seg>
<seg id="54">And it adopts a dangerous ethnic form.</seg>
<seg id="55">Last month protesters in Gondar, an amharan city, attacked by Tigray and hatred towards the Tigray becomes more and more common in the social media.</seg>
<seg id="56">Analysts say that the protests bring the US and other Western allies into a peculiar position.</seg>
<seg id="57">The American government used Ethiopia as the basis for Dronenflights over the neighboring Somalia, even if it recently announced that it closed this base.</seg>
<seg id="58">While the West wants to support democracy clearly, he doesn't want his ally to collapse in an already volatile area.</seg>
<seg id="59">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "this," said Mr Abdi, "" "" "" "" is a very thin tightrope walk. "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "</seg>

<seg id="1">Donald Trump explains his claim Obama had founded ISIS was "sarcasm"</seg>
<seg id="2">Donald J. Trump tried to dispel the last controversy surrounding his campaign by attacking his multiple repeated claim that President Obama and Hillary Clinton were the "founders" of the terrorist group Islamic State, not serious.</seg>
<seg id="3">This clarification raises new questions on the communication skills of the Republicans' presidential candidates, whether he is able to communicate clearly and easily with the American public.</seg>
<seg id="4">It also brings his fellow combatants, who endeavour to take care of him during an eventful phase, in the peculiar position to declare his statements, which he could not have meant at all.</seg>
<seg id="5">After having made the announcement at an election event on Wednesday evening, Mr. Trump withdrew in terms of the allegation on Thursday and insisted that he really did not intend to indicate that President and Mrs. Clinton had created ISIS.</seg>
<seg id="6">But in an early morning Tweet on Friday Mr. Trump said he was simply sarcastic.</seg>
<seg id="7">The tweet was contrary to the previous day, on which Mr. Trump said in a number of interviews, he said the accusation completely serious.</seg>
<seg id="8">When the conservative Radiomorator Hugh Hewitt wanted to help Mr. Trump to weaken the statement by reminding him that Mr. Obama wants to destroy ISIS, the Republican presidential candidate did not want to know anything about it.</seg>
<seg id="9">The last storm of criticism came down upon Mr. Trump while he attempted to steer the focus of his campaign due to falling demand values on the economic situation.</seg>
<seg id="10">Mr. Trump and Mrs. Clinton talked about the economic situation in Michigan this week.</seg>
<seg id="11">On Friday Mr. Trump tried to return to this subject again.</seg>
<seg id="12">Talking about Twitter, he warned that Mrs. Clinton's suggestions would lead to higher taxes and that he found her speech boring.</seg>
<seg id="13">Mr. Trump has already brought sarcasm to his defense.</seg>
<seg id="14">At the end of July he criticised himself when he said the Russians should hack Mrs Clinton's emails, but later he explained "Of course, I said the sarcastic."</seg>
<seg id="15">This method allows Mr. Trump to postpone the linguistic boundaries in politics and then back down as needed.</seg>
<seg id="16">"I think it's one of his methods to test how certain messages are received by his fans, how they arrive, and then" clarify "depending on how the reaction falls." said Ruth Sherman, a communication expert who observes the language of both candidates.</seg>
<seg id="17">But I think he's clever enough to keep his statements vague enough so that they can be interpreted in different ways.</seg>
<seg id="18">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "instead of defusing the tone for the presidential elections, Mr. Trump has assumed an even more corrosive sound, as his cargo values have gone further." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="19">A new survey by NBC / Wall Street Journal / Marist, which was published on Friday, showed a lead with a great advantage in the states of North Carolina, Virginia, Colorado and a head-to-head-race in Florida.</seg>
<seg id="20">While Mr. Trump generally tries to excuse himself for his provocative statements, he often accuses his critics of distorting his statements or misunderstanding his humour.</seg>
<seg id="21">But while he emphasises the focus of attention in the last months of his presidential campaign, Mr. Trumps Scherze has brought his loyal co-workers into the uncomfortable situation to stand up to him regardless of how provocally his statements may be.</seg>
<seg id="22">Rudolph W. Giuliani, former mayor of New York and one of Trumps's most prominent advocates, took great effort to defend the candidate from Thursday in a CNN interview.</seg>

<seg id="25">Most of the mainstream republican try to argue that under Obama, in which Mrs. Clinton served as Minister of Foreign Affairs, ISIS allowed ISIS to spread by taking control of the situation in the Middle East aggressively.</seg>

<seg id="9">Their latest collaboration, "A decent meal," which will appear on Tuesday at the Harper Publishing House, illustrates the history of American cuisine during the Great Depression.</seg>

<seg id="12">When the reporter ordered Hackney, this found the couple suitable for a discussion about the food in the era of great depression.</seg>
<seg id="13">"rich food products were very popular," said Ziegelman.</seg>

<seg id="19">In the years before the Great Depression the table was in an American budget, especially in rural areas, an All-You-Can-Eat-Buffet.</seg>
<seg id="20">Teams of women cook for male fellows and it was served freshly baked pate for breakfast, lunch and dinner.</seg>

<seg id="23">The new budgeted diet was just as tense: mysterious foods such as breads and casseroles were added to staple foods, the casserole was a "wonderful way to recycle food leftovers," because cooks could hide unappetizing ingredients under a creamy sauce.</seg>
<seg id="24">Fresh fruit was replaced by cheaper drybeans.</seg>
<seg id="25">Meat that was the central focus of the American kitchen for years became a rare luxury.</seg>
<seg id="26">Peculiar blends have been tried out, as a calorie-rich and nutritious gratification took precedence over taste or even common sense.</seg>

<seg id="31">It was typical for many of the housekeeping recipes.</seg>
<seg id="32">As never before or since then, budget economists - including Louise Stanley, head of the Federal Bureau of Home Economics from 1923 to 1943 - had such an approach to eating habits in the country.</seg>
<seg id="33">By publishing recipes and articles in newspapers and magazines, they encouraged women to become "household politicians" and the challenge of turning pamphlets such as creamy spaghetti with carrots into delicious meals.</seg>
<seg id="34">"a Square Meal" is a festival of historical delicacies.</seg>
<seg id="35">In particular, the reports on the response of the government to the starving citizens, such as President Herbert Hoover's Lass-me-Cake food attitude.</seg>
<seg id="36">While he publicly praised the simple Iowa peasant house kitchen of his kitchen, he fed like the millionfold man of the world he became.</seg>

<seg id="38">He ate in an almost gilded dining room and took a tuxedo.</seg>
<seg id="39">He was superbly alien to reality.</seg>
<seg id="40">President Roosevelt might have made the same mistake if his wife Eleanor had called upon him to stamp an example with his stomach.</seg>
<seg id="41">As described in the book, the present of a housekeeper with no interest in flavors by Mrs. Roosevelt suggested that the White House produced the most boring food in Washington, but also one of the most comforting ones. "</seg>
<seg id="42">Many of the species from the era of Great Depression to deal with food was rejected as soon as the country returned to the legs.</seg>
<seg id="43">The legacy is on our continuing focus on calories and food, said Ziegelman, as well as how science was applied to foods.</seg>

<seg id="1">Greenland: the oldest vertebrae is almost 400 years old</seg>
<seg id="2">Rare sight.</seg>
<seg id="3">Greenland's hairs usually come to the surface only in winter.</seg>
<seg id="4">This shark was allowed to return to the sea after an investigation on board the research ship Sanna.</seg>
<seg id="5">He was born in 1624 and floats with a good 1 km / h through the North Atlantic - to this day.</seg>
<seg id="6">Greenland's hairies only get up with 150 years of offspring.</seg>
<seg id="7">Leisurely the Greenland-shark floats along the bottom of the North Atlantic, in an hour he arrives at an average just 1.220 meters.</seg>
<seg id="8">Only when it arrives on it accelerates the five-meter-long animal at a full 2,6 km / h - and is half as fast as a seal with this top speed.</seg>
<seg id="9">This lifestyle characterized by slowness, however, seems to be a panacea for a high age.</seg>
<seg id="10">Julius Nielsen from the University of Copenhagen and his colleagues report in the journal "Science" at any rate from a Greenland hai who could be 392 years old.</seg>
<seg id="11">"madness," Alexander Scheuerlein, from the Max Planck Institute for Demographic Research in Rostock, comments this life span, which means a world record for vertebrates.</seg>
<seg id="12">Admittedly, the evolutionbiologist suspected that Greenland's hair will be stone-old.</seg>
<seg id="13">Only the evidence was lacking.</seg>
<seg id="14">Greenland's sharks are hard to observe, finally they live mainly in the ice sea in front of the sparsely populated coasts of Canada, Greenland, Norway and Svalbard.</seg>
<seg id="15">Because they prefer water temperatures around the six degrees Celsius, they usually appear only in winter on the surface.</seg>
<seg id="16">Researchers know little about the lifestyles of Greenland.</seg>
<seg id="17">Their slow-motion-motion measured it when they presented six animals with one transmitter in front of Svalbard.</seg>
<seg id="18">However, in the stomach of an animal, researchers found the remains of a seal, another had swallowed the jawbone of a young polar bear.</seg>
<seg id="19">Maybe they hunt sleeping animals or patrol on the bottom of the ice cream and seek cadaver that tortured from higher water layers down.</seg>
<seg id="20">Julius Nielsen and his colleagues investigated 28 Greenland Sharks, fishermen between 2010 and 2013 fetched from Greenland or Svalbard as bycatch from the depths of the North Atlantic.</seg>
<seg id="21">The smallest shark was just 81 centimetres long, while the largest is 502 centimeters.</seg>
<seg id="22">To determine the age of the animals, the carbon-14 method analysed the lens nucleus of the sharks.</seg>
<seg id="23">This center of the eye lens is formed already before the birth of the sharks, the proteins contained in it will no longer be renewed.</seg>
<seg id="24">The two smallest sharks had a remarkable amount of carbon-14 in the lens nucleus.</seg>
<seg id="25">Their birth, therefore, was to lie after the early 1960s when nuclear disarmament attempts infiltrated large amounts of this radioactive carbon into the atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="26">In the third smallest animal with a length of 220 centimetres, the lens nucleus contained a small surplus of carbon-14 from nuclear weapons tests, it is likely to have celebrated its 50th birthday in its investigation in 2012.</seg>
<seg id="27">In their lens nucleus all larger Greenland hairs, on the other hand, had normal carbon-14 quantities produced by cosmic rays in the atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="28">In fact, the Carbon-14 clock for a 493 centimeter long Greenland showed an age of 335 years, while the record shark with 502 centimeters might be 392 years old.</seg>
<seg id="29">That Greenland-hai-females only get offspring when they are longer than four meters, was known.</seg>
<seg id="30">Now the researchers were able to assign an age to the length.</seg>
<seg id="31">Since one of the animals with 392 centimetres was probably at the threshold for sexual maturity and its age was determined at 156 years, Greenland's hair with reproduction obviously let itself at least one and a half centuries of time.</seg>
<seg id="32">This is also likely to be world record for vertebrates.</seg>
<seg id="33">It is not a coincidence that such methane waves live mainly in icy waters.</seg>
<seg id="34">The previous record holder, a 211 year old Greenland wale, in whose bacon at the neck was a 120 year old harpoon tip, was caught up in front of Alaska.</seg>
<seg id="35">Due to the low temperatures, the organism of the animals living there often runs on low-flames.</seg>
<seg id="36">So they mature later - and age slower.</seg>
<seg id="37">In order to keep warm in the cold water, the animals are often very large.</seg>
<seg id="38">Because the volume grows much faster than its surface by which the animal loses heat.</seg>
<seg id="39">The heat loss of one gram of mouse is therefore much larger than with a gram of elephant.</seg>
<seg id="40">Another advantage: you have fewer enemies.</seg>
<seg id="41">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "a smaller animal therefore lives more dangerous and should focus on having as many descendants as possible as possible," "" "" "" "declares Scheuerlein" "" "" "". "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="42">A very big animal, on the other hand, should invest its resources rather in a long life.</seg>

<seg id="2">Hillary Clinton announced on Friday its tax return for 2015, which gave rise to USD 10.75 million and an effective 34.2% tax rate for the democrats and their husband.</seg>
<seg id="3">In 2015, the Clinton Foundation donated $1 million for charitable purposes, mainly to the Clinton Foundation; former President Bill Clinton spent almost USD 5.3 million in Redemptorars; the former Foreign Minister issued an income of USD 3 million from the publisher Simon & Schuster for her book on her term of office in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.</seg>

<seg id="7">In a stark contrast, Donald Trump hides behind false statements and retracts in reference to his previous promises to publish his tax declarations.</seg>
<seg id="8">It is common for U.S. presidential candidates to publish their tax declarations although they are not obliged to do so by law.</seg>

<seg id="2">Scotland's Callum Skinner razed last night in the men's team-Sprint in the Velodrom in Rio to fame when the British team defended the London 2012 title.</seg>
<seg id="3">The 23-year-old from Glasgow took the anchor roll, which his compatriot Sir Chris Hoy made himself to Eigen. he was proud of the legend when he stormed home in order to win a victory from the favourites of New Zealand.</seg>
<seg id="4">Britain claimed a shocking victory four years ago while Hoy won the fifth of six Olympic medals.</seg>
<seg id="5">They repeated the trick after finishing in March at the London Underground World Championships in spite of Hoys's withdrawal only a modest sixth place.</seg>
<seg id="6">The problem between Beijing and London was the replacement of the Anfahrers Jamie staff.</seg>
<seg id="7">They did this in good time as a Hindu.</seg>
<seg id="8">His retirement created a gap, the Kian Emadi and Matt Crampton tried to close.</seg>
<seg id="9">Skinner was the man in whom they remained, when they saw potential in the Scotsman, which has now unfolded.</seg>
<seg id="10">Hindu, Kenny - who four years ago with Hoy won - and Skinner rounded the qualification round a Olympiapord, but in the standard rounds the New Zealanders won in the first round.</seg>
<seg id="11">And the British trio won the duel with gold.</seg>
<seg id="12">After his lap he fell short, but Kenny brought the team forward and Skinner kept it.</seg>
<seg id="13">A change of strategy made a major part of the transformation, while Hindu went in a higher gear to slow it down and allow Kenny and especially Skinner to keep pace.</seg>
<seg id="14">Hoy looked from his position as BBC expert and dropped Skinner, Kenny and Hindu, when they climbed to the podium.</seg>
<seg id="15">"" "" "" "the 23-year-old Skinner from Glasgow said:" "" "" "" "it is a flattering comparison." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="16">I'm just here to do my best and make a name for myself.</seg>
<seg id="17">In the final round we set up an Olympic chord and defeated the world champion.</seg>
<seg id="18">It was just incredible.</seg>
<seg id="19">There is no better way to win this.</seg>
<seg id="20">After the triumph in 2012 on the side of Kennys and Hoys, Hindu admitted that after a weak start he deliberately fell on the track.</seg>
<seg id="21">He withdrew this statement later and there was no appeal of England's rival.</seg>
<seg id="22">With such an outstanding victory this time there was no such problem.</seg>
<seg id="23">"" "" "" "Hindu said:" "" "" "" "it feels with all the GB flags on the platform like London." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="24">We have come together as a team in the last three months.</seg>
<seg id="25">We have so badly hit so many world titles that it was unbelievable to win again at the Olympiad.</seg>
<seg id="26">This is an event, a gold medal for the nation winning seven of 10 titles in both Beijing and London.</seg>
<seg id="27">If that is a barometer of our progress over the past five months, we expect successful five days in the Velodrom.</seg>
<seg id="28">With the form Kennys it is in the field of possibility that he repeated Hoys's victory of three Olympic gold medals in a competition.</seg>
<seg id="29">That would be for Kenny - who was exactly 12 years younger than Hoy, who was also born on March 23 (a seemingly holy date for British sports; on that day Steve Redgrave, Mo Farah and Roger Bannister were born) - a yield of six gold medals and a silver medal.</seg>
<seg id="30">That would be the same for Hoy.</seg>

<seg id="37">It was the only medal competition of the day, but there were other good news for England.</seg>
<seg id="38">Sir Brad Wiggins, Ed Clancy, Steven Burke and Owain Doull qualified with the fastest performance in four-four-kilometre races.</seg>
<seg id="39">They arrived at the destination in 3: 51,942.</seg>
<seg id="40">The world record that won gold in London in 2012 was 3: 51,659.</seg>
<seg id="41">The first and final round (22.42) will take place on the second day of the competition where Wiggins will focus on safety.</seg>
<seg id="42">He had fought with delegates before the qualification yesterday, when officials called him to measure his body size.</seg>
<seg id="43">In the corresponding women's competition, which will be continued and finished tomorrow, Laura Trott, Joanna Rowel Squarters, Elinor Barker and Katie Archives soon of Milngavie went to world record time in 4: 13,260.</seg>
<seg id="44">The GB team relies on his strong train team to dominate the middle period of the Olympic Games and to bring a crowd of medals.</seg>
<seg id="45">After a truly exceptional portrayal of absolute dominance in Beijing and London, the expectations for Rio were shut down.</seg>
<seg id="46">Dramas played in the background, so the resignation of Shane Sutton technical director in April was in the midst of sexism and bulbbing reproaches, as well as the retirement of sizes such as Hoy and Victoria Pendleton.</seg>
<seg id="47">However, if you look at the first evening of the competition in the Velodrom, it looks like the legendary reputation of GBs, which has reached its peak at the perfect moment, will be repeated again.</seg>

<seg id="2">The future of the aluminium meltdown of Portland in Victoria - as well as hundreds of workplaces by workers - stand in the game as the system operator terminates the energy supply contract and thus abolishes all supply contracts, as the supplying energy company announced.</seg>
<seg id="3">This move was followed by the government's decision in Victoria at the beginning of this year, not to grant any further subsidies for the operation of the plant.</seg>
<seg id="4">A subsidy for 20 years will expire in November.</seg>
<seg id="5">Up to 2000 jobs at the Alcoa plant in Portland are at stake.</seg>
<seg id="6">No less than 2000 workstations - direct and indirect - could be at risk of closure.</seg>
<seg id="7">In addition, it could come to domino effects as the melt consumes around 10 percent of the total electricity output of Victorias.</seg>
<seg id="8">In 2014 Alcoa closed the Point Henry Schmeling, which led to a closure of the Anglesea power plant last year.</seg>
<seg id="9">The melting of Alcoa in Portland loses money and risks closure.</seg>
<seg id="10">This step follows the years of speculation in terms of the future of the plant, originally as a result of the strong Australian dollar and last because of the electricity price for the plant.</seg>
<seg id="11">AGL, which supplies the large aluminium melting plant with its Loy Yang A power plant in Latrobe Valley, announced that three other owners are expected to terminate their contracts.</seg>
<seg id="12">The plant is in the majority ownership of a joint venture between Alcoa and Alumina, of which the Chinese company CITIC and the Japanese Marubeni Corp hold smaller portions.</seg>
<seg id="13">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "AGL expects that the plant will continue to operate in Portland, which means further physical demand for electricity by smelting," "" "" "" "said the company." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="14">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "AGL further said that the contracts were called" "" "" "" "hedging transactions" "" "" "", "which should come into force from November 2016." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="15">Contracts have a 12 month period of notice, so that they will end 2017.</seg>
<seg id="16">"hence, AGL assumes that the contracts in the financial year 17 will contribute to revenues," said the current supplier.</seg>
<seg id="17">All potential impact on earnings on AGL from the GJ 18 is currently limited by forecasts of strong futures markets for wholesale prices.</seg>
<seg id="18">AGL shared with the fact that the value of the contracts was already written in its annual closing in the amount of $187 million in "anticipation of a termination."</seg>
<seg id="19">Alcoa said that the decision to book the Treaties was the "Ability of Alcoas... to operate the melt or to guarantee the power supply to the melt."</seg>
<seg id="20">The US company said that it concluded a 20 year contract with Loy Yang in 2010, which should have entered into force from November this year even if it is still a statement guilty of why it has withdrawn from the contract.</seg>
<seg id="21">Due to the poor economic conditions of the industry, analysts warn of the possible closure of the Portland melt in Victoria and the Tomago plant near Newcastle.</seg>
<seg id="22">In reference to the analysts' statements at the beginning of the week, the Head of Operations Stephen Mikkelsen said that Portland annually consume around 600 MW and Tomago about 900 megawatts of electricity.</seg>

<seg id="6">This represents the cliché action nearly every birthday septic of a child's return (Seacrest brought the sentence, "You thought we had forgotten you?"), with the honesty of a cartoon on a slot at 8 o'clock in the morning), but Kris had to let her other girls take part in this publicity.</seg>
<seg id="7">With regard to the September edition of Vogue, a new era of cardan has certainly begun.</seg>
<seg id="8">Kendalls's big sister Kim likes her, as for the Vogue cover (she and her husband Kanye West were on it in April 2014), but the cover of the September edition of the magazine is a league for itself.</seg>

<seg id="15">But even with the small chance that Mrs. Jenner - who is described by the magazine as the "breakthrough model" of her generation - falls under the previous category, she is in good company.</seg>
<seg id="16">These celebrities are not related to famous people or reality stars or youngsters of today who know how to turn a good Snapchat video (even though everything is applicable to Jenner).</seg>

<seg id="2">More than 160,000 of the country's auxiliary units are reported annually by the municipal centres, while the industry is preparing for the impact of further shortcuts to already overloaded transactions.</seg>
<seg id="3">In Queensland, three out of five people - mostly elderly, immigrants, needy workers, victims of violence and those who have no means of unjust delogiances and similar - are rejected in their search for free legal advice and legal assistance.</seg>

<seg id="5">As of June next year, these legal centres will lose another 30 percent of their federal funds.</seg>
<seg id="6">The Director of the Regional Centres of Quebec James Farrell said that the last survey of the National Association of Community Centers indicates that thousands of people have already been rejected each year.</seg>
<seg id="7">Farrell said that the situation would only be worse without the federal government's resolution.</seg>

<seg id="9">People who leave violent relationships, people with unmanageable and oppressive debts, families going through separations, workers who have been dismissed unjustly - all these people have problems of legal nature and this survey shows that they can't get the help they need.</seg>
<seg id="10">The federal government will cut the funding by 30 percent from June 2017, which means that thousands of needy people from Queensland will be forced to cope with their legal problems without any help.</seg>
<seg id="11">We urge the German Attorney General and Federal Office of Justice and Senators from Queensland George Brandis to delay these shortcuts immediately so that people can receive the help they need in case of legal problems.</seg>

<seg id="5">It was thicker and bigger, so it wasn't well in the hand either.</seg>
<seg id="6">On the contrary, it was pretty clumsy.</seg>
<seg id="7">The built-in memory was initially eight megabytes, which would be enough for about two selfies with high resolution.</seg>

<seg id="9">"" "" "" "the" "" "" "" "Nokia 9000 Communicator" "" "" "" "came into business 20 years ago, on 15 August 1996, and it was the first smartphone." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="10">For a few Euro lovers can buy the devices on the internet, but they somehow come from the stone age of the internet age.</seg>
<seg id="11">20 years ago, however, the communicator was a sensation.</seg>
<seg id="12">The Finnish mobile phone maker announced the product a few months earlier at the Cebit computer fair in Hanover as an "Western pocket format office."</seg>
<seg id="13">In fact, the new mobile phone could receive a lot for then standards: SMS and e-mails could be sent and received, even via fax was the communicator.</seg>
<seg id="14">Even access to web pages was possible via HTML browser, albeit cruelly slow.</seg>
<seg id="15">A calculator was available, a digital address book and an electronic calendar.</seg>

<seg id="19">The average retail price of a smartphone in Germany was 392 euros in 2015.</seg>
<seg id="20">No one could suspect in August 1996 that the communicator would become the beginning of the smartphone era.</seg>

<seg id="2">For companies that earn money with online advertising, according to one of the software manufacturers, attempts to bypass ad blocking are the same as a "cat and mouse game."</seg>
<seg id="3">On Thursday, only two days after Facebook announced that it would block scoring on its desktop site, Adblock Plus published a blog post in which it announced that users could update their filters in the program to re-block advertising on the social network.</seg>
<seg id="4">On Tuesday, Facebook shared that his desktop site would change coding concerning its advertising display to make it more difficult to recognize the indication of which part of the advertisement is advertising.</seg>
<seg id="5">But Adblock announced that it has found a new way to circumvent the new codes.</seg>
<seg id="6">In a blog post, the spokesman of Adblock Ben Williams wrote that "this kind of Hin-and-Her-battle between the antimed open source community and the converters has been underway since the invention of display blockers," and that Facebook will soon come with a new solution.</seg>

<seg id="3">The police call on witnesses after a woman was convicted of several vehicles on a highway in the early morning hours on Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="4">The incident occurred on the A1 near Morges in the canton of Vaud shortly after midnight.</seg>
<seg id="5">A woman laid out in the dark in an act of despair "on the streets and were hit by several cars, said the police in Vaud.</seg>

<seg id="10">However, it remains to be seen whether one of the drivers will be shown.</seg>

<seg id="2">According to the projections of a new NASA climate model, Venus was probably once inhabitable.</seg>
<seg id="3">Scientists at the Goddard Institute for Space Studies from NASA developed a model to discover the past of Venus using tools and algorithms that are similar to those of climate scientists.</seg>
<seg id="4">The model was designed to determine if the Venus with its hot, waterless surface and CO2-tight atmosphere was once brought up under similar conditions.</seg>
<seg id="5">Scientists have previously indicated that the slow revolution of Venus could be explained by their dense atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="6">But the latest simulation suggests that Venus could have had a thin, earth-like atmosphere, and nevertheless slowly turned on.</seg>
<seg id="7">The model also illuminated the topography of the early Venus.</seg>
<seg id="8">The planet probably had more dry areas than Earth, but once had enough water and geographical variability to house life and protected from rapid evaporation.</seg>
<seg id="9">The early Venus also benefited from a sun that was 30 percent weaker.</seg>
<seg id="10">"in the GISS model simulation, the slow revolution of Venus is exposed for almost two months," explained GISS scientist Anthony Del Genio in a press release.</seg>
<seg id="11">This warms the surface and produces rain that creates a thick layer of clouds, which works like an umbrella to shield the surface from a large part of the solar heat.</seg>
<seg id="12">The result is average temperatures that are some degrees cooler than the Earth today.</seg>
<seg id="13">The model produced a history of Venus, similar to evolution that was previously suspected of planetary explorers.</seg>
<seg id="14">Although it was originally inhabitable, Venus -- in the course of several billions years -- exposed too much heat and ultraviolet light.</seg>
<seg id="15">Their oceans were evaporated and their water vapor was burned from ultraviolet light.</seg>
<seg id="16">As their hydrogen escaped, only a thick atmosphere of carbon dioxide fell back with a deadly greenhouse effect -- the Venus, the way we know it today.</seg>
<seg id="17">The researchers shared the results of their new Venus climate model in the Geophysical Research Letters.</seg>

<seg id="2">The latest mission with the Kepler Space Telescope has helped astronomers to gather the most complete catalogue of rotation rates among the stars of the star cluster of the Pleiades.</seg>
<seg id="3">The new data help astronomers understand why stars revolve at different rates in the star cluster and in what context the rotation time periods with planetary origin are.</seg>
<seg id="4">"we hope that through comparing our results with other star cluster, we learn more about the relationship between the mass of a star, its age and even the history of its solar system," said Luisa Rebull, a researcher at Caltech's Infrared Processing and Analysis Center in Pasadena, in a press release.</seg>
<seg id="5">The star cluster of the Pleiades is 445 light years distant from the Earth.</seg>
<seg id="6">Many stars in this star cluster, which originated approximately 125 million years ago, now reach adulthood.</seg>
<seg id="7">They are turning on the quickest now.</seg>
<seg id="8">At peak rotational rates, these poignant stars expel large quantities of starches.</seg>
<seg id="9">Since these winds travel through the magnetic fields of the stars, they have a braking effect on the stars.</seg>
<seg id="10">When a star altert, its rotation rate begins to slow down.</seg>
<seg id="11">Kepler measures the rotation rate of each star by recognizing the time between the appearance of a recognizable star spot -- like sunspots --.</seg>
<seg id="12">The latest catalogue of rotational rates indicates that more massive stars revolve more slowly than less massive stars.</seg>
<seg id="13">Rebull compares the stars with dancers, with bigger stars more slow pirouettes than smaller ones.</seg>
<seg id="14">"in the" ballet "of the Pleiades we see that slow rotors tend to be more solid, whereas faster rotors tend to be very bright stars," said Rebull.</seg>
<seg id="15">As the star cluster of the Pleiades is so close, it serves as an ideal cosmic laboratory to compare stellar qualities like rotation rates.</seg>
<seg id="16">"the star cluster of the Pleiades offers an anchor for theoretical models of stellar rotation in both directions, both younger and older," said Rebull.</seg>
<seg id="17">It is still much ahead of us what we would like to learn more about how, when, and why stars slow down their rotation rates and so to speak, hang up their "dance shoes."</seg>
<seg id="18">Rebull and her colleagues have reported in three newspaper reports extensively about their latest analysis of the rotational rates of the Pleiades, which will soon appear in the Astronomical Journal.</seg>

<seg id="10">With 696 homeruns, 3114 Hits and 2021 points for his teams ("Runs") for the Seattle mariners (1994 to 2000), Texas Rangers (2001 to 2004) and since 2005 the Yankees he managed some milestones.</seg>
<seg id="11">With Hall-of-Fame-Members Hank Aaron and Willie Mays only two other baseball players have similar values in the most important statistics.</seg>
<seg id="12">But in the hall of the Baseballs the 41-year-old shouldn't be taken up yet.</seg>
<seg id="13">For as successful Rodriguez - nickname "A-Rod" - was on the field, his appearance outside the square was so controversial.</seg>
<seg id="14">Already in 2009, the superstar at "ESPN" admitted, between 2001 and 2003, forbidden steroids to be taken.</seg>
<seg id="15">In August 2013, he was closed for 211 games due to an involvement in the so-called Biogenesis scandal until the end of 2014.</seg>
<seg id="16">Rodriguez is considered the main suspect to have received high performance funding for years through an anti aging clinic in South Florida.</seg>
<seg id="17">After a dispute, the lock was reduced to 162 meetings.</seg>
<seg id="18">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "the League could even have done a favour for the year 2014 because I have played for 20 years without a break," "" "" "" "said Rodriguez back then." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="19">Also his farewell-days are not silent.</seg>
<seg id="20">While many baseball legends get the big stage in their last games, Rodriguez frequently had to sit on the bench.</seg>
<seg id="21">"my job does not include a farewell tour."</seg>
<seg id="22">"my job entails trying to win any game," said Yankees-Coach Joe Girardi.</seg>
<seg id="23">After all, Rodriguez, who was married to the actress Cameron Diaz and told the relations with Popstar Madonna and actress Kate Hudson, got sympathy-expressions of fans from Yankee-archrival Boston Red Sox.</seg>
<seg id="24">"we want A-Rod," the fans sang at the 4: 9 defeat against the Rodriguez team.</seg>

<seg id="2">Caught: because of a positive doping test, weightlifter Adrian Zielinski from Poland in Rio will not be able to start.</seg>
<seg id="3">Rio de Janeiro - The 2016 Olympic Games are overshadowed by the first official doping cases.</seg>
<seg id="4">An inquisitive athlete would have won almost a medal.</seg>
<seg id="5">Before the seventh race day, the first official doping events have become known in Rio de Janeiro.</seg>
<seg id="6">The chinese swimmer Chen Xinyi, 3000-meter-obstacle skipper Silwia Danekova from Bulgaria and Polish weightlifter Adrian Zielinski were positively tested and excluded - these messages come to an end immediately before the start of the already critical athletics competitions.</seg>
<seg id="7">In Chen last Sunday the diuretic hydrochlorothiazide was detected, which is used as a masked agent for doping substances.</seg>
<seg id="8">The International Sports Court CAS confirmed its expulsion from the Olympic Games on Friday afternoon.</seg>
<seg id="9">On Sunday, the 18-year-old had the fourth place in the finals over 100 m Butterfly, only 0.09 seconds she missed the bronze medal.</seg>
<seg id="10">On Friday, Chen had to take part in the course of more than 50 m Freestyle.</seg>
<seg id="11">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "the International Olympic Committee (IOC) requested the opening of the B-trial and a hearing." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="12">The national association takes the matter "very seriously and demands full cooperation in the investigations," quoted Xinhua from a message: "we will work together with the International Sports Court CAS and will accept the judgement."</seg>
<seg id="13">For the first time in history the IOC, but the CAS, is responsible for the sanction of athletes with positive cases.</seg>
<seg id="14">Also in the night of Rio the news leaked across the positive test at Gdanekova, the 33-year-old went on to the offensive.</seg>
<seg id="15">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "I had three tests, all negative, and my fourth test was positive," "" "" "" "this was an incredible shock," "" "" "" "she told the Bulgarian TV station BNT." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="17">According to the report, the banned substance should be the blood doping agent EPO.</seg>
<seg id="18">Danekova has been suspended for the time being, according to BNT, the B-rehearsal should already have been positive.</seg>
<seg id="19">Bulgarian Prime Minister Boyko Borissov immediately reported a criticism of the athlete.</seg>
<seg id="20">"I don't understand why athletes don't draw the right conclusions," he said: "we Bulgarians are under observation, so many have already been excluded."</seg>
<seg id="21">For example, all weight lifters from the chronically doping nation are not allowed to take part in Rio.</seg>
<seg id="22">On Friday the case "Adrian Zielinski" was also known, the London Olympic Champion in the class up to 85 kg was tested as his brother Tomasz three days earlier on the anabolic steroid neandrolon.</seg>
<seg id="23">Both of them deny the intake, but both may not start in the class up to 94 kg.</seg>
<seg id="24">Before the start of the athletes, especially the case of Danekova is another serious blow for the reputation of the whole sport.</seg>
<seg id="25">The World Federation of IAAF had prohibited the entire Russian team except for systematic doping the launch, also the nation-nation Kenya produces numerous bad news in Rio.</seg>

<seg id="1">Datenklau: so perfide blackmail hackers their ransom</seg>
<seg id="2">Programmers of blackmailing malware are currently targeting companies - and are successful.</seg>
<seg id="3">According to a recent survey of malware infection specialists, Malwarebytes, among 540 companies in North America, Great Britain and Germany, 40 percent of the surveyed companies were at least once in the past twelve months, partially victims of an attack with blackmail software.</seg>
<seg id="4">In Germany, just under 20 per cent of the companies were already aiming for ransomware compressors.</seg>
<seg id="5">40 per cent of the victims willingly paid the ransom demanded by the perpetrators in order to be able to use the attacked systems and data again.</seg>
<seg id="6">According to the observations of Malwarebytes, the perpetrators are noticeably specializing in attacks in corporate networks.</seg>
<seg id="7">If they are successful there, the potentially redeeming ransom is much higher than in private users.</seg>
<seg id="8">"we are currently watching a frightening fast evolution of the malware," says Malwarebytes boss Marcin Kleczynski in conversation with the "world."</seg>
<seg id="9">In 2008, most malware programs were still designed to send advertising.</seg>
<seg id="10">Then the perpetrators discovered blackmail software for themselves.</seg>
<seg id="11">Only private users were the target, but the change to company attacks was quickly done in the past few months.</seg>
<seg id="12">Ransomware works on a simple pattern: once on a victim's computer, it searches specifically for recently changed files such as Word, Excel or database files, as well as archives of images and videos.</seg>
<seg id="13">These files encrypt the ransomware and deletes the originals sustainably.</seg>
<seg id="14">The software then presents the receivables of the blackmail.</seg>
<seg id="15">In order to get the end key code to the files, the victims must pay money - mostly in the form of the cryptocurrency Bitcoin.</seg>
<seg id="16">But where private users are the personal photo database at stake, companies are dealing with sensitive customer data or project databases without stopping production.</seg>
<seg id="17">The damage is correspondingly higher when a ransomware hits.</seg>
<seg id="18">22 percent of affected German companies reported sales losses through ransomware, 13 percent even had to completely interrupt business operations, in one case people were in danger of life.</seg>
<seg id="19">In Germany there were already several hospitals victims of attacks whose patients can be acutely threatened by the loss of medical records.</seg>
<seg id="20">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "we always tell the victims: don't pay, you only support the problem," "" "" "" "explains Kleczynski." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="21">But 80 to 90 percent of companies pay their data again.</seg>
<seg id="22">It is difficult for managers to reject the perpetrators "demand in the face of a standstill during operation.</seg>
<seg id="23">The hackers again know this and try everything to build a good reputation.</seg>
<seg id="24">In a current study, F-Secure security researchers investigated the user interfaces and contact with blackmail and came to the conclusion: the perpetrators are actually trying to build up some kind of customer service to take more money.</seg>
<seg id="25">They tell their victims via chat how they can pay via Bitcoin, set free accessible support websites or decrypt free sample files.</seg>
<seg id="26">And if private people are redeemed for payments of just a few hundred euros, companies need to negotiate hard and pay five-digit sums to return their data unencrypted.</seg>
<seg id="27">In view of the potentially high and relatively risky winnings from ransomware extortion, hackers become more professional and share the work, declares security expert Chester Wisniewski of the anti-virus provider SOPHOS: "a single person can write a ransomware approximately within a week."</seg>
<seg id="28">It is more likely that this is three or four people.</seg>
<seg id="29">The programmers then sell their malware in the form of a software module to the actual blackmail.</seg>
<seg id="30">The previous malware kits have been created by buying malware, consulting and additional tools for a unique, fixed price between $1000 and $10,000.</seg>
<seg id="31">"the scope of delivery includes an adjustment tool, so that smaller configurations, appearance and branding can be changed," says Wisniewski.</seg>
<seg id="32">The blackheads are then looking for further hackers to spread the newly purchased software among the victims.</seg>
<seg id="33">We live in a service industry.</seg>
<seg id="34">So one logs in one of the forums underground, buys the set of a criminal and instructs another to install the software on as many PCs as possible.</seg>
<seg id="35">Payment is per infected machine.</seg>
<seg id="36">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "usually the criminals employ spammers with spreading," "" "" "" "says Wisniewski." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="37">The risk of ransomware is now known for many companies that better secure their data.</seg>
<seg id="38">Over 50 percent of the companies IT managers in the Malwarebytes survey put their trust in resisting ransomware by means of file-back-ups and scanner software.</seg>
<seg id="39">Accordingly, the perpetrators are already pursuing new strategies.</seg>
<seg id="40">"if the encryption of data alone is not a sufficient threat to successful recovery, the perpetrators are instead threatening to publish sensitive data such as customer lists or price calculations," says Malwarebytes boss Marcin Kleczynski.</seg>
<seg id="41">This means that the damage potential, depending on the type of data, is much higher than before.</seg>
<seg id="42">The perpetrators will also be able to take up completely new targets on the internet of things in the future.</seg>
<seg id="43">At the Hackerkonferenz, Defcon, security researchers demonstrated how they could get a thermostat connected to the Internet under their control.</seg>
<seg id="44">In the middle of the winter, the activation of such a blocked heater might be worth a ransom.</seg>
<seg id="45">If the perpetrators do not block entire production lines in a factory instead of heating in the future, Ransomware could also become a topic in Industry 4.0.</seg>

<seg id="1">One for all eventualities</seg>
<seg id="2">Honda HR-V is flexible and suitable for everyday use</seg>
<seg id="3">Honda wants to pack everything in the small HR-V: a little SUV, a little coupe and also the versatility of a mini van.</seg>
<seg id="4">Sounds rather overloaded, but the HR-V, which was constructed on the same new platform as the new jazz, actually proves to be extremely flexible in everyday life.</seg>
<seg id="5">Although the HR-V is only 1.60 m high, the passengers have a lot of space both in the first row and in the rear, it doesn't work tight at any point.</seg>
<seg id="6">The interior materials are well finished and have a pleasant effect, only the cockpit top is falling off.</seg>
<seg id="7">The HR-V is more versatile than comparable vehicles.</seg>
<seg id="8">There is not only a trunk of 453 l on high-level and 1026 lbs with inverted back rests, but there is the "Magic Seats."</seg>
<seg id="9">This is less magical than it sounds: the seat surfaces of the rear bench can be folded like a chin-up seat and thus offer storage space that is 1,24 m high from the floor to the ceiling.</seg>
<seg id="10">The luggage compartment can be loaded well, but the load height is 650 mm higher than the comparable Peugeot 2008.</seg>
<seg id="11">The tested 1.6-liter diesel with 88 kW / 120 hp accelerates the HR-V very powerful thanks to the torque of up to 300 Nm in wide speed ranges.</seg>
<seg id="12">However, he should do a bit quieter for his work.</seg>
<seg id="13">The daily consumption of 4.7 l / 100 km is pleasing.</seg>
<seg id="14">Another engine is available: a 1.5 litre petrol engine with 96 kW / 130 hp.</seg>
<seg id="15">An all-wheel drive is not offered.</seg>
<seg id="16">The driving behavior is balanced, a good compromise between dynamics and comfort.</seg>
<seg id="17">But the steering might be a bit more direct.</seg>
<seg id="18">The equipment in the "Executive" tested top version leaves nothing to be desired.</seg>
<seg id="19">The security systems include the City emergency braking assistant (works up to speed 32), the collision warning system and the lane keeping assistant.</seg>
<seg id="20">The collision warning sometimes irritates because when maneuvering, it evaluates many obstacles as "approaching objects."</seg>
<seg id="21">The telescopic assistant works very reliably.</seg>
<seg id="22">And the intelligent speed controller responds to the traffic sign recognition and throttles the speed if required.</seg>
<seg id="23">But the full connectivity is only available for the top features: 7-inch touchscreen, navigation device, app integration and more.</seg>
<seg id="24">Two USB and one HDMI socket are under the armrest and are therefore somewhat cumbersome to achieve.</seg>
<seg id="25">The roughly 29,000 euros for the well-equipped top diesel are fine.</seg>
<seg id="26">If you don't want to invest so much, you will receive the petrol engine from 20000 Euro, the diesel from 23,000 euros.</seg>
<seg id="27">The engines comply with the Euro 6 emission standard.</seg>
<seg id="28">With the HR-V, Honda offers a versatile and everyday car.</seg>

<seg id="1">Better traffic flow on the motorway bridge</seg>
<seg id="2">It stews itself regularly on the bypass - here is a picture of November.</seg>
<seg id="3">But this should change: the right of law is to be extended.</seg>
<seg id="4">This is a good news for all car drivers who are standing in traffic every evening in traffic on the surrounding road, when driving via the highway to the crossroads (A 43).</seg>
<seg id="5">The road construction will be extended on Tuesday and Wednesday (16 / 17 August) in the area between the Hammer Street and the Departure Weser Straße the right-hand road to 700 meters.</seg>
<seg id="6">Drivers can then thread directly from the hammer street to the right.</seg>
<seg id="7">The big advantage is that traffic jams up early, whereby the overall process is improved on the busy section of the Bundesstraße 51.</seg>
<seg id="8">The idea with the extended exit had the CDU faction in the district to represent Münster-West.</seg>
<seg id="9">The road narrowing on the feeder annoys drivers particularly between 17 and 19 o'clock.</seg>
<seg id="10">On weekdays, the return traffic goes up to the bridge across the Albersloher path and sometimes beyond.</seg>
<seg id="11">The reason for this is the needle-eye on the B 51 just before the exit Weser Straße.</seg>
<seg id="12">From here, traffic is only channeled via the motorway bridge.</seg>
<seg id="13">The second track had to be built back in three-quarters of years ago.</seg>

<seg id="1">Relaxing night: tips for sleeping disorders</seg>
<seg id="2">In the evening, one rolls around eternally, at night, one is awake for hours, in the morning already before the wake-up ringing, it is no longer necessary to think of sleep.</seg>
<seg id="3">This is anything but relaxing.</seg>
<seg id="4">After all, one is in good company with such problems: according to the Robert Koch Institute, about a quarter of adults have sleep disorders and more than ten percent feel their sleep frequently or permanently rather than relaxing.</seg>
<seg id="5">How do sleeping problems or sleep disorders express?</seg>
<seg id="6">There are several forms of sleep disorders, and there can be various causes behind them, emphasises Hans-Günter Weeß, member of the board of the German Society for Fighting Equipment and Sleep Medicine.</seg>
<seg id="7">But what you understand for the time being is the insomnia, that is, a break-in and sleep-disturbance.</seg>
<seg id="8">Many people feel inadequate or inadequate, says Jens Wagenknecht, member of the Executive Board of the German Medical Association, with practice in the Lower Saxony region of Varel.</seg>
<seg id="9">What's behind sleep disorders?</seg>
<seg id="10">The causes of sleep disorders are complex.</seg>
<seg id="11">Behind this can be organic, psychological or behavioural factors, but also medicines.</seg>
<seg id="12">Infrequently, sleeping disorder is an expression of another disorder.</seg>
<seg id="13">"very early awakening is most common in depression," says Weeß.</seg>
<seg id="14">And it can be that different factors would like to thank each other.</seg>
<seg id="15">Those who have a herniated disc, for example, can lie badly, wake up every two to three hours and may possibly start to ponder about everyday problems and worries, there's an example.</seg>
<seg id="16">This leads to tension, and sleep is no longer possible.</seg>
<seg id="17">When should sleep problems become a doctor?</seg>
<seg id="18">Those who do not sleep well over a period of one month at a minimum of three nights a week should go to the doctor, advises the doctor.</seg>
<seg id="19">The impairment can look quite different: one is beaten, tired, unslept, has difficulties with the attention and concentration, is easily irritable, has mood swings or physical ailments such as stomach or headache.</seg>
<seg id="20">In order to alleviate sleep problems, it is important to find out their causes.</seg>
<seg id="21">As treatment options include behavioural changes, cognitive behavioural therapy or even drugs - classic sleeping tablets only in exceptional cases and at most for two weeks - inquired.</seg>
<seg id="22">There is hardly any lower sleeping physician in Germany, says Prof. Ingo Fietze, Head of the interdisciplinary sleeping medical centre of the Charité Universitätsmedizin Berlin.</seg>
<seg id="23">Therefore, if you have trouble sleeping, you should contact your GP first, advise you to shoot.</seg>
<seg id="24">This can clarify if the problems have a physical cause.</seg>
<seg id="25">Who should go to the sleep lab and what happens?</seg>
<seg id="26">For an investigation in the sleep laboratory, doctors advise doctors, for example, snoring with breathing problems, in case of illness of the day, in case of insomnia, or if one does not find the cause of a sleeping disorder, explains fietze.</seg>
<seg id="27">It is not necessary to prepare for the investigation.</seg>
<seg id="28">You should spend the day normal.</seg>
<seg id="29">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "please do not make a nap," "" "" "" "says Fietze." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="30">After paneling, you go to bed at its normal time.</seg>
<seg id="31">In addition to the electrodes on the body, one carries a nose goggles, a chest strap and a feeler at the finger.</seg>
<seg id="32">In addition, a camera records the sleeping bereens on the ceiling.</seg>
<seg id="33">How can those affected get a grip on the problems?</seg>
<seg id="34">There are quite a lot of adjusting screws where you can get a better sleep.</seg>
<seg id="35">Strike counts on: regular sleep and tidging times, not sleeping too long in bed, not watching TV for falling asleep, avoiding watching alcohol and not looking at the watch at night - then one begins to reckon immediately, and that is quite and at all not conducive.</seg>

<seg id="2">The former German swimming pool Markus Deibler has expressed himself on Facebook for the disappointing cut of the DSV team at Olympis.</seg>
<seg id="3">In December 2014, he premiered gold at the World Cup Championships in Doha and at the same time presented his first world record.</seg>
<seg id="4">The former DSV-Athlete Markus Deibler has now protected himself via Facebook in front of his ex-team mates.</seg>
<seg id="5">"in a country where an Olympic winner gets 20,000 €award and a jungle-king 150,000 €should no one wonder about missing medals," the 26-year-old wrote on his Facebook page on Friday.</seg>
<seg id="6">The transport system in swimming is bad, while doping controls are very good.</seg>
<seg id="7">This means that we can't compete with countries that promote a great deal and do not see or even operate the doping issue.</seg>
<seg id="8">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "I am not saying that the controls should be set here," "" "" "" "he explained further." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="9">If he wanted to start a comeback, Deibler would have to be reported nine months before his first launch of the National Anti-Doping Agency Germany (NADA).</seg>
<seg id="10">That's exactly how you should keep it with countries.</seg>
<seg id="11">"those who cannot be controlled for a certain time before WM / OS by independent controllers of the WADA / FINA must not participate," says the election-burger, who meanwhile operates an ice cream parlor.</seg>

<seg id="1">Old buildings, some linden trees, in between still another cobblestone pavement: the Rigaer Straße in Berlin-Friedrichshain looks not like that, but the police is one of the "dangerous places" of the city.</seg>
<seg id="2">When one goes along the road from east to west, one passes to playgrounds, a frescoed kindergarten and a Bioladen.</seg>
<seg id="3">Someone "ugly!" sprayed on the facade of a grey house.</seg>
<seg id="4">In contrast to a Lidl, which is to be demolished soon, a house with high windows and 133 new apartments will be built here until 2017.</seg>
<seg id="5">Article on this "trendy district," as the responsible real estate agency Friedrichshain calls, is preferred over the last few weeks with burning cars.</seg>
<seg id="6">The reason is the house with number 94: once it was occupied, meanwhile the tenants have rental contracts, but on the ground floor there are still rooms occupied and are used for events.</seg>
<seg id="7">Since the beginning of the year, especially the Berlin inner senator Henkel has spoken several times for a hard action by the police against the project, the area referred to as "no-go zone" for policemen and the 94 as the starting point of autonomous violence.</seg>
<seg id="8">After having been cleared on 22 June, the rooms on the ground floor, the Kadterschmiede, with 300 police officers patrolling out official statements with 30 to 40 officials and three team cars on site, locked parts of the road and stopped visitors from entering the house with number 94.</seg>
<seg id="9">In the meantime, construction workers renovated the rooms on behalf of the unknown house owner.</seg>
<seg id="10">On 13 July, a Berlin Administrative Court decided that the clearing had been illegal, and a day later, police and construction workers retired from sympathizers and residents.</seg>
<seg id="11">On this summer afternoon the road works peacefully: parents walk with children, people sit on the sidewalk in front of the houses in the sun, others are talking about late.</seg>
<seg id="12">In the immediate vicinity of the house there are a primary school and kindergartens.</seg>
<seg id="13">Leftist force is not the main concern of many residents: Kerstin Neugebauer, who lives in Kiez since 1999, and Jana *, who is raising three children here, are mainly annoyed by the police presence.</seg>
<seg id="14">They share the concern of rising rents and gentrification with the residents of the house-projects.</seg>
<seg id="15">It doesn't sound like a Kiez, who wants mostly police protection from the vandaliatory left.</seg>
<seg id="16">The ditch, which the Berlin inner senator and the police put up between occupants and their neighbors, obviously does not exist.</seg>
<seg id="17">Friedrichshain in the East of Berlin was actually a traditional working class district, which today has a low average income compared to the rest of the city and has a high risk of poverty.</seg>
<seg id="18">Also house occupations and the born housing projects have been part of the Kiez for a long time: in 1990, numerous houses were occupied in the former GDR, including almost the entire Mainzer Street close to the Rigaer.</seg>
<seg id="19">While the Mainzer was swept under large police orders in a regular street battle, many of the projects were legalized in the Riga and are partly inhabited by the people they occupied 26 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="20">At the same time, the district has become a magnet for tourists and ballots from all over the world over the last few years: residents of GDR times and former home owners now share their neighbourhood with them.</seg>
<seg id="21">This is also reflected in the rents that have risen by almost 60 per cent since 2009 for new rentals.</seg>
<seg id="22">Many of the newbuildings in the Rigaer are attacked as symbols for this development: you can see them at raised windows or freshly painted facades, which were thrown with ink bags.</seg>
<seg id="23">No other road was mentioned this year as often together with the words "left-autonomous violence."</seg>
<seg id="24">One reason not all neighbours consider this as a problem might be that they are not necessarily affected by crime: crime such as body injury statistics is almost exclusively directed against policemen.</seg>
<seg id="25">The largest part of the offences make property damage that tends to meet new buildings and newly renovated houses.</seg>
<seg id="26">For Kerstin Neugebauer, who has been living in a rented house for 17 years alongside the controversial 94, there can be no question of uncertainty.</seg>
<seg id="27">As for violence, it is crucial: the people in the 94 are their neighbors, which were certainly not.</seg>
<seg id="28">Even the famous burning cars no longer give it to the Rigaer anymore.</seg>
<seg id="29">For the studied architecture, her street is not a criminal offense, on the contrary: "here one helps one another, lives together on the street and gets more from each other than elsewhere."</seg>
<seg id="30">Neugebauer has been consciously drawn into the Riga-Straße - and remained.</seg>
<seg id="31">This is why it was so important for her to get back to the streets: from the police, the politics and the media, which in July all suddenly claimed the sovereignty of the city.</seg>
<seg id="32">But in the eyes of residents like Neugebauer, the road continues to be taken away from them: faceless newbuildings in former construction gaps that displace the old residents.</seg>
<seg id="33">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "these are condominiums, which are not interesting for many - here people live rather than people who are not so well contaminated," "" "" "" "she says." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="34">"I can absolutely not approve violence and destruction."</seg>
<seg id="35">But what should you do if you never listen to someone?</seg>
<seg id="36">There is frustration on all sides, also with the police and the inhabitants.</seg>
<seg id="37">For those who are angry about color bombings Kerstin Neugebauer has little understanding: the Hautes and the left scene were part of the Kiez.</seg>
<seg id="38">Who draws, should be aware of it - just like someone who runs into a pub area that can complain badly there about noise.</seg>
<seg id="39">All persons presented with the first names have asked to not be called with their correct name.</seg>

<seg id="1">Urbach: Annika deuschle is a new Commissioner for Refugees</seg>
<seg id="2">Annika Deuschle is the contact person in matters of integration and organizer.</seg>
<seg id="3">She is also a social worker on site.</seg>
<seg id="4">Since July Annika Deuschle has been the Commissioner for Refugees for Urbach.</seg>
<seg id="5">The social education team supports the team of management around Achim Grockenberger.</seg>
<seg id="6">It sees itself as a contact partner for all actors: refugees, working group refugee aid, administration, authorities and who else is involved.</seg>
<seg id="7">Regine's customer of the working group suggests that the volunteers are more than grateful that Deuschle is now there, the eisling woollen mill, which above all has a problem.</seg>
<seg id="8">For example, some - less ridiculed than on the multitude of desired tasks - meant that the administration wanted to leave the place.</seg>
<seg id="9">Looking for an administrative power with a talent for languages and people, combined with a long-standing experience in social work, just an eiving woollen mill.</seg>
<seg id="10">But administrative work is not its central area, meaning Annika Deuschle.</seg>
<seg id="11">Above all, it concerns organisation, work with local people and behind the scenes as well as network activity.</seg>
<seg id="12">The 31-year-old has been there for about six weeks.</seg>
<seg id="13">It has a 50 percent position on three years.</seg>
<seg id="14">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "it was high time," "" "" "" "says Regine client, that Annika Deuschle supports honorable and full-time actors." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="15">There are big and small problems, organizational, human and communication problems.</seg>
<seg id="16">New containers soon stand in the Wasenstraße</seg>
<seg id="17">A serious problem has been for some time to find homes for the connecting refugees who have been recognized.</seg>
<seg id="18">The municipalities are responsible for the connection provision.</seg>
<seg id="19">You must take the refugees in their own or rented living rooms.</seg>
<seg id="20">The costs for the construction, the rent or the renovation of these accommodation must be borne by the local authorities themselves.</seg>
<seg id="21">The responsibility changes from the administrative office to the municipality and the job centre.</seg>
<seg id="22">Problem: there are free objects, but not every landlord wants to offer his apartment.</seg>
<seg id="23">The search has been very difficult for some time.</seg>
<seg id="24">De facto, the administration does not find private apartments.</seg>
<seg id="25">So far, it is not working to rely on private apartments, so Deuschle.</seg>
<seg id="26">Therefore, common apartments need to be infamous as it is so beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="27">So, new containers will soon be installed in the Wasenstraße.</seg>
<seg id="28">But it's not done with apartments.</seg>
<seg id="29">Perspective is the keyword, Regine customer and Annika deuschle agree.</seg>
<seg id="30">In addition to a permanent residence there are internships, apprenticeships, school grounds, one-euro jobs and employment assistance for refugees and migrants who have to be undressed or established.</seg>
<seg id="31">"more places would be good," Regine reported.</seg>
<seg id="32">Many work in the building yard or help house master builders, do charitable work - and that motivates and very tidy, as Annika Deuschle reports.</seg>
<seg id="33">She hopes that working for the community leads to a positive external effect.</seg>
<seg id="34">This is "no employment therapy."</seg>
<seg id="35">But activity does not only mean work.</seg>
<seg id="36">The day needs a solid structure, say Deuschle and Client.</seg>
<seg id="37">People need to develop a sense of belonging.</seg>
<seg id="38">So it takes offers like sports, contacts with locals and above all language courses.</seg>
<seg id="39">Professional courses are rare.</seg>
<seg id="40">So here is also the Administration and Honorary Director.</seg>
<seg id="41">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "it is central that the refugees feel they are welcome and welcome in Germany." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="42">The long duration of the procedure is a problem.</seg>
<seg id="43">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "they must explain to the refugees that it is just and they can bridge the time wisely, for example with language courses." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="44">Those who at some point develop the feeling that he can't help anyone in Urbach, do not work and be useless, he will never integrate himself.</seg>
<seg id="45">The clear majority was motivated.</seg>
<seg id="46">"" "" "" "but there are also problems," "" "" "" "says customer honest," "" "" "" "people with whom nothing is concerned." "" "" "" "the work of Deuschle and the customer is therefore always to motivate others." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="47">All this is already a "mammoth task."</seg>
<seg id="48">A difficult question: do the two according to recent occurrences fear radicalization, even in a small congregation like Urbach?</seg>
<seg id="49">"no," Regine's customer clearly states "what some naive name might call." a residual risk can and does not want to exclude it.</seg>
<seg id="50">However, the helpers are already sensitised.</seg>
<seg id="51">These incidents are also the issue of refugees.</seg>
<seg id="52">They were afraid that the assassins would completely dismiss them.</seg>
<seg id="53">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "they want to show that they have nothing to do with it," "" "" "" "says Regine customer." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="54">Many would like to stay in Urbach.</seg>
<seg id="55">So you have to look for major and honorary members on site and in the region for activities.</seg>
<seg id="56">They always have in the background that a new blow to refugees and migrants would soon come to Urbach.</seg>
<seg id="57">Does Germany need an upper limit?</seg>
<seg id="58">To answer this question clearly, politics abhors.</seg>
<seg id="59">Actually it is unfair to put them on the spot.</seg>
<seg id="60">"in Urbach we haven't arrived yet where we want to go," Annika Deuschle says.</seg>
<seg id="61">No new refugees, that would relax the situation.</seg>
<seg id="62">Regine's customer also makes it clear that the Urbachs are already busy to integrate the existing people in a reasonable way.</seg>
<seg id="63">Currently, these are about 100 people, mainly young men.</seg>
<seg id="64">But if people are in need, they must help them, both women agree.</seg>
<seg id="65">The political world situation is so complicated, there are no simple answers.</seg>
