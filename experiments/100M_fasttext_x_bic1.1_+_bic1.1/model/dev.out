Obama receives Net@@ any@@ ahu
the relationship between Obama and Net@@ any@@ ahu is not friendly .
the two wanted to discuss the implementation of the international agreement as well as on Te@@ hr@@ an &apos;s dest@@ abili@@ zing actions in the Middle East .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the meeting , however , it is also about the conflict with the Palestinians and the two @-@ state solution discussed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the relationship between Obama and Net@@ any@@ ahu has been ten@@ se for years .
Washington critic@@ ises Israel &apos;s continuing settlement construction and acc@@ uses Net@@ any@@ ahu &apos;s lack of will in the peace process .
the deal with the Iranian nuclear programme promoted by Obama has wor@@ sen@@ ed the relationship between the two .
in March Net@@ any@@ ahu held a controversial speech at the invitation of the Republi@@ cans before the US Congress , which was partly considered an aff@@ ront to Obama .
the speech was not discussed with Obama , a meeting was rejected with reference to the election im@@ pending in Israel .
in an emergency call , Professor to have shot his girlfriend
in an emergency call , Professor Sh@@ ann@@ on Lamb told with a somewhat c@@ unning voice of the police that he shot his girlfriend and that the officials would have to come to his house .
lamb was important to stress that his &quot; sweet dog &quot; was still alive and probably excited , and he said the family contacts of the dead woman could be found on the phone .
inside the house , the officers found the cor@@ p@@ ses of A@@ my Pr@@ enti@@ ss and a hand@@ written note , which was scri@@ b@@ bled on a white block : &quot; I am sorry I wanted to und@@ o it , I loved A@@ my and she is the only woman who ever loved me . &quot; this was according to the authorities in the letter , and he was signed by Lamb .
there was no indication that Lamb who taught in two online courses for the Delta State University in Cle@@ vel@@ and , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , had already travelled 300 miles to the school grounds , where he , according to the police , shot a popular historian , E@@ than Schmidt , at the door to his office and killed .
Delta State University Poli@@ ti@@ ff Lyn@@ n Bu@@ ford said that university staff members heard the shooting at 10 : 18 .
he said that Lamb made the fatal emergency at some point afterwards .
until the end of the day there was another death : lamb took the life when the police tied him .
one day after shooting in the university , students and lec@@ turers forced to hide behind closed doors , the authorities still try to get a picture of what Lamb motivated .
the details published by the investig@@ ators at both ends of the state , as well as what students and staff who knew him , helped to draw a picture of a talented , but possibly difficult teacher .
students said they were looking forward to his teaching .
the police in Gau@@ tier , where Pr@@ enti@@ ss died , said he has no history of violence or a criminal background .
Schmidt himself mentioned Lamb in a book written by him in which he mentioned the &quot; wonderful people &quot; with whom he shared his academic life .
both taught in the Department of Social Sciences and History whose faculty includes 17 members , and many students visited courses of both .
at the same time there were some inclin@@ ations to problematic behavior .
a student , Brand@@ on Be@@ a@@ vers , who praised Lamb , said he seemed a little nervous and nervous , &quot; as if something was wrong with him . &quot;
another student , Mik@@ el Sy@@ kes , said that he told him that he had to deal with stress at the end of the academic year 2014 @-@ 15 .
lamb before had asked the Delta State University for health reasons and said he had any health problem .
this year he taught only two online courses .
the latest changes in the university &apos;s employment policy meant that the promotion , for which Lamb had worked so hard for him , would be no guarantee for an automatic path to employment as Assistant Professor .
the university president William La@@ For@@ ge said he didn &apos;t know anything about a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt , but &quot; of course there was something in Mr Lam@@ bs &apos;s performance . &quot;
these are questions that Lamb cannot answer any more .
after the flight from the campus , the police found Lam@@ bs lane later when he returned to Miss@@ issi@@ ppi from Ar@@ kan@@ s@@ as .
before he could be arrested , Lamb killed himself with a .@@ 38 cali@@ ber gun in the back@@ yard of a house about a mile south of his childhood home on the outskirts of Green@@ ville , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , said Washington County Cor@@ oner Meth@@ el Johnson .
his car was still running in the dri@@ ve@@ way .
it was not immediately clear why lamb went to this house , but Johnson said they knew he knew the people who lived there .
lamb grew up in the area .
in 2009 , Lamb began his work at the university , which has 3,@@ 500 students in a city with approximately 12@@ ,000 inhabitants and taught ge@@ ography and pedago@@ gy .
he completed his doc@@ torate in the spring in pedago@@ gy .
one of the long @-@ standing friends Lam@@ bs described him as intelligent , charism@@ atic and funny .
Car@@ la H@@ air@@ ston said she was 15 and lamb was 20 when they met by common friends .
she and her friends were in the High School , and he was the cool elderly guy who tried several years to teach her the guitar game .
he was the s@@ warm of women at that time .
all the girls were melting away when he was there , &quot; H@@ air@@ ston said , 40 and living in Jackson &apos;s subur@@ b of Brand@@ on .
lamb and c@@ enti@@ ss were obviously some time together .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in emergency call Lamb &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I killed my wife , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but there was no certificate from a marriage . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they had a dog named Light@@ ning , who lived with them in the brick house adjoining a ba@@ you in Gau@@ tier .
the police said that the dog was fine .
the ex @-@ husband of Pr@@ enti@@ ss , Sha@@ wn O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en , said that they were divor@@ ced 15 years ago but had stayed friends and had a daughter who was 19 years old now .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she was totally destroyed by the ground , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en about his daughter . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
she and her mother were absolutely best friends .
O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said he never met Lamb , but by his daughter Ab@@ ig@@ ail he heard that Lamb was interested in music and played blues .
Lamb met Pr@@ enti@@ ss , when he and Ab@@ ig@@ ail appeared on a summer @-@ fair three years ago .
later they played together the one or the other gig .
O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said his daughter writes and sings their own music .
Pr@@ enti@@ ss was a nurse who worked on various companies online .
Mike Sha@@ ffer , a bar@@ tender and sometimes entertainment coordinator at The Ju@@ le@@ p Room , a poorly lit bar near Gau@@ tier , said that he saw Lamb and Pr@@ enti@@ ss Night at night 5 . September for the last time after Lamb had finished his guitar and mouth harmon@@ ica in front of a spar@@ se audience .
there was no sign that anything was wrong .
&quot; just a happy couple , &quot; he said .
we were at clean up and jo@@ king together .
I mean they both had a good sense of joke .
Schmidt , the dead professor , led the first semester program and specialized in American native people and colonial history , said Don Allan Mit@@ ch@@ ell , an English professor at the school .
he was married and had three little children .
he studied at the Empor@@ ia State University in K@@ ans@@ as and was President of his Brotherhood and the student committee .
on Tuesday evening approximately 900 people attended the Delta State Campus in Cle@@ vel@@ and , including lec@@ turers , employees , students and members of the congregation at a cand@@ l@@ eli@@ ght memorial service .
Sch@@ mid@@ ts &apos;s wife Li@@ z and his brother Jeff Schmidt also participated in the guard guard while the Univers@@ it@@ or &quot; B@@ right Mor@@ ning Star &quot; and Ama@@ zing Grace sang .
the lessons will be resum@@ ed on Wednesday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we try to move our students back to return , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said La@@ For@@ ge . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the crisis is over .
this is a day of healing .
A@@ my and Ro@@ geli@@ o Soli@@ s reported from Cle@@ vel@@ and , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi .
associated Press Auth@@ ors E@@ mil@@ y Wag@@ ster P@@ ett@@ us in Green@@ ville , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , and Rebecca Sant@@ ana in New Orleans contributed to this report .
this story has been corrected to reflect that the police now says that Lamb made the emergency call after he shot Schmidt , and that Lamb in his emergency call was called Pr@@ enti@@ ss as his wife , but there is no indication that the two have ever married .
Toys R Us plans to hire fewer workers for Christmas time

while the holidays are still months away , the Christmas business is getting closer and companies are preparing to hire temporary workers to equip shops with employees who sell , send and deliver products .
Michael J. Fox j@@ okes about his &quot; Date &quot; with Princess Diana
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the premiere of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Back to the Future &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was a great moment for Michael J. Fox . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was also remarkable for personal reasons .
&quot; we sat in the theatre waiting for the ro@@ y@@ als , and I notice that the seat is empty next to me , and it becomes clear to me that Princess Diana will sit next to me , &quot; he said in a trailer for an upcoming documentary &quot; Back in Time . &quot;
the film begins , and it comes to my mind that I am a simul@@ ated y@@ awn and an arm length from being with the princess of Wales on a date .
back in Time , a documentary about &quot; Back to the Future , &quot; presents interviews with Fox , Le@@ a Thom@@ p@@ son and Christopher Lloyd , as well as with director Robert Z@@ em@@ eck@@ is and the producer Steven Spiel@@ berg .
&quot; back for the Future &quot; premi@@ ered 30 years ago .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it really is for me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Spiel@@ berg said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; un@@ disputed the biggest time travel film ever filmed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

UN leader says there is no military solution in Syria
Secretary General B@@ an K@@ i @-@ moon says his response to Russia &apos;s enhanced military support for Syria is : &quot; there is no military solution &quot; of the almost five years lasting conflict , and more weapons will only wor@@ sen violence and misery for millions of people .
the UN chief again calls for all parties , including the shared UN Security Council , to unite and support inclusive negotiations on finding a political solution .
B@@ an said a press conference on Wednesday that he plans to meet the Foreign Ministers of the five permanent member nations of the Council - US , Russia , China , Great Britain and France - at the edge of the meeting of the General Meeting of Shar@@ eholders in this month to discuss the situation in Syria .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he regre@@ ts that the spl@@ its in the Council and the Syrian people and the regional powers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; make this situation in@@ soluble . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; B@@ an called for the five permanent members to show the same solidarity and unity in Syria dealing with Iran &apos;s nuclear deal . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
8 survey values showing that Donald Tr@@ ump is serious .
some have tried to brand him as a flop .
others have dismissed him as a joke .
and some wait for a collapse .
but no matter how some Republi@@ cans try to pull Donald Tr@@ ump from the upper ranks in poll@@ s down , it hasn &apos;t worked ( yet ) .
ten of the last eleven national surveys showed Donald Tr@@ ump in the double @-@ digit range , and some begin to seriously ask what it means to the odds of nom@@ in@@ ating the real estate mo@@ gul@@ s .
of course , it is still too early in the election period .
nobody claims that Tr@@ ump is likely to win the Republi@@ can nom@@ ination .
experts emphasize that at that time , in 2011 , Rick Per@@ ry &apos;s leadership was handed over to the rising Her@@ man Cain , none of whom only gained a state in the nom@@ ination process .
and there are many reasons why he would have to fight in a general election .
but out@@ si@@ ders such as J@@ eb Bus@@ h@@ s Super PA@@ C and the conservative economic group Club for Growth now recognise Tr@@ um@@ ps &apos;s stamina and begin to drop their dollars to overthrow him .
here are some current survey values indicating that the real estate mo@@ gu@@ l is not just a temporary phase :
Tr@@ um@@ ps Pop@@ ular values have turned 180 degrees .
shortly before Donald Tr@@ ump announced his can@@ did@@ acy in mid @-@ June , a survey from the Mon@@ mouth University revealed that only two of ten Republi@@ cans saw the real estate mo@@ gu@@ l positive .
by mid @-@ July , it was 40 percent .
at the beginning of August there were 52 percent .
now six of 10 Republi@@ cans have a positive view of Donald Tr@@ ump .
about three out of ten say that they have a negative opinion .
and these figures are held in early states .
a Qu@@ in@@ ni@@ pi@@ ac vote in I@@ owa last week noticed that 60 percent of the Republi@@ cans have a good opinion of Tr@@ ump .
two thirds of GO@@ P voters would be happy with Tr@@ ump as candidates .
in a CN@@ N / OR@@ C survey last week 67 percent of the Republi@@ cans said they were either &quot; delighted &quot; or &quot; satisfied &quot; when Tr@@ ump was nominated .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; only two of ten say they would be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; anno@@ yed &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if he were the candidate . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
only Ben Car@@ son creates about the same enthusiasm as tr@@ ump ( 43 per cent say they would be &quot; enth@@ r@@ alled &quot; vs. 40 percent that say the same about tr@@ ump ) .
next in terms of enthusiasm ?
Marco Ru@@ bio with just 21 percent .
on the other hand , 47 percent of the Republi@@ can voters say that they would be &quot; dis@@ satisfied &quot; or &quot; anno@@ yed &quot; if J@@ eb Bush , the favorite of the establishment , would be the candidate .
a majority of the Republi@@ cans see Tr@@ um@@ ps temper@@ ament not as a problem .
while Donald Tr@@ ump is widely critic@@ ised for his bom@@ b@@ astic and offensive statements , 52 percent of Irish voters ten@@ ding to the Republi@@ cans believe that the real estate mo@@ gu@@ l has the right temper@@ ament for a president , so ABC News / Washington Post on Monday .
the same number is true of the nation &apos;s first pres@@ election state , the state of I@@ owa , where the same 52 percent of the Republi@@ cans think that he has the personality for a supreme commander , according to Qu@@ in@@ ni@@ pi@@ ac last week .
nevertheless , 44 percent think that he did not have the personality to effectively carry out his office , and almost six out of 10 In@@ depend@@ ents say that his tem@@ per did not fit into the White House , so ABC / Post .
Republi@@ can voters get used to the idea .
when they set up their lo@@ fty hats , Republi@@ can voters hold Tr@@ ump for real .
if they are asked who most likely the GO@@ P nom@@ ination wins , say after a CN@@ N / OR@@ C survey last week four out of ten that Tr@@ ump is the best bet .
this is a change since the time when four of ten end of July put their money on J@@ eb Bush .
complete disclosure : GO@@ P voters did not have the clear@@ est crystal ball in the past .
at this time in the last cycle four of ten Republi@@ cans thought that Rick Per@@ ry would win the nom@@ ination by just 28 % for the final candidate Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney .
nevertheless , a large number of GO@@ P voters look at Tr@@ um@@ ps Camp@@ aig@@ n as plau@@ sible .
even if the Republi@@ cans gathered around another candidate , Tr@@ ump sums up almost everyone .
some experts point out that the fragmented field probably contributes to tr@@ um@@ ps leadership while the anti @-@ Tr@@ ump support is spread to more than a dozen other candidates .
but a survey conducted by Mon@@ mouth University in early September shows that in a hypo@@ the@@ tical head @-@ on @-@ head @-@ race between Tr@@ ump and most other Republi@@ can candidates , Tr@@ ump re@@ aps the majority support .
he has 13 points ahead of Car@@ ly Fi@@ or@@ ina , before Marco Ru@@ bio 14 points , before Walker 15 points , before J@@ eb Bush 19 points and finally before Rand Paul , John Ka@@ sich and Chris Christi@@ e 33 points .
it is a head @-@ to @-@ head @-@ race with T@@ ed Cruz .
the only candidate who beats him ?
Ben Car@@ son would over@@ take the entrepren@@ eur with 19 points in a hypo@@ the@@ tical head @-@ to @-@ head race .
a scar@@ ce majority of Donald Tr@@ ump fans say they have formed their mind .
a new survey by C@@ BS / NY@@ T on Tuesday shows that only slightly more than half of voters support Tr@@ ump saying they have forgiven their votes .
of course , much can happen to change that , and no one can really say never change the mind .
46 percent said they left the door open to change to other candidates .
nevertheless , Tr@@ um@@ ps is the strongest competi@@ tor at the moment of other out@@ si@@ ders , the neuro@@ surgeon Ben Car@@ son , but voters who say they have formed their mind are twice as common for Tr@@ ump .
six out of 10 Republi@@ cans say they agree with Tr@@ ump on immigration .
since Donald Tr@@ ump in his election campaign before two months ago , immigrants from Mexico called &quot; rap@@ ists , &quot; was the immigration and fishing point in the public discourse on 2016 .
some are concerned that the bom@@ b@@ astic expression of Tr@@ ump &apos;s crucial His@@ panic @-@ Americans will keep away from the Republi@@ can Party and will damage the re@@ orientation efforts .
but after the new ABC / Post @-@ survey of Monday , six out of 10 Republi@@ cans say they agree with Tr@@ ump in questions of immigration .
so long as immigration remains in the spotlight , it seems that Donald Tr@@ ump will do it .
the fru@@ stration of the government climb@@ s to new levels .
meanwhile , Donald Tr@@ ump and Ben Car@@ son account for about half the support of Republi@@ can voters , especially by their out@@ si@@ ders status .
six out of 10 Republi@@ cans say in the new Mon@@ days pol@@ l of ABC / Post , they prefer a political out@@ sider than someone with government experience .
and they are angry at Washington .
a survey by Des Mo@@ ines Register / Blo@@ om@@ berg in I@@ owa two weeks ago shows that three of four I@@ owa Republi@@ cans were frustr@@ ated about the Republi@@ cans in Congress , with 54 percent &quot; un@@ satisfied &quot; and 21 percent &quot; in@@ fer@@ nal . &quot;
Munich , Sy@@ lt and Co. : the five most exclusive residential areas in Germany
here in the Hob@@ ook@@ en@@ weg is the most expensive residential complex - with a view over the North Sea row@@ att .
in the street , a square meter of a single roof house costs 7@@ 3,@@ 300 euros .
&quot; on Sy@@ lt , the range of objects is naturally limited , &quot; says the study - therefore the high price .
a new study shows in which special layers a square meter costs most .
of course , 18,@@ 70 euros per square meter for a student bust in Munich are not really little .
in contrast to Germany &apos;s top homes , however , one of the prices comes as Pe@@ an@@ uts .
the Real Estate Service Provider Angel &amp; Völ@@ kers has published a ranking of the most exclusive German residential locations - with square meter prices in di@@ zz@@ ying heights .
there are several tens of thousands of Euros - per square meter , well @-@ noticed .
but good , who can afford it ...
inci@@ dentally : Munich is not at the top here as an exception .
champi@@ ons League : Bavaria dream start thanks to Müller and Götz@@ e
double Tor@@ rem@@ e in Pi@@ ra@@ eus : Bavaria @-@ Star Thomas Müller has just one run .
a happy hit by Thomas Müller gave the FC Bayern the way to a deser@@ ved 3 : 0 at the Olympi@@ ac@@ os Pi@@ ra@@ eus - then it ran .
a sovereign pr@@ el@@ ude to the Champions League season .
world champion Thomas Müller and Mario Götz@@ e received a dream start in the &quot; Mission Milan &quot; in the Hex@@ enk@@ essel of Pi@@ ra@@ eus .
the team of coaches P@@ ep Guardi@@ ola won their kick @-@ off in the Champions League in the Greek record champion Olympi@@ ac@@ os in hot atmosphere thanks to Müll@@ ers Doppel@@ pack ( 5@@ 2nd / 90@@ . + 2 ) and id@@ ol@@ at@@ ry hits ( 8@@ 9. ) earned at 3 : 0 ( 0 : 0 ) .
the twel@@ fth tournament success in series should be the first step towards the final on May 28 , 2016 in Italy , where Guardi@@ ola finally wants to bring the H@@ enk@@ el@@ pot@@ t to Munich in the third attempt .
in his 28 hit in the Champions League , Müller received good help from Olympi@@ ac@@ os @-@ Tor@@ wart Roberto , who had caused a shot of the world master as a flan@@ k .
&quot; we will not under@@ estimate them , &quot; Bayern @-@ captain Philipp L@@ ah@@ m promised hot @-@ bloo@@ ded fans in front of the game at the Kar@@ ais@@ k@@ ak@@ is Stadium before 31.@@ 6@@ 88 - and the Munich @-@ based people were talking .
they showed a concentrated and committed performance without shining .
Pi@@ ra@@ eus has won his most recent six home games in the top class , including some famous clubs such as Manchester United , At@@ l@@ é@@ tico Madrid or Ju@@ vent@@ us Turin .
in 2011 Bor@@ ussi@@ a Dortmund again stum@@ bled ( 1 : 3 ) .
but the Bavaria , in seven European @-@ up du@@ els with Greek teams un@@ defeated , did not want to be the next victim .
they cour@@ age@@ ously went to work with their offen@@ sion@@ ist efforts , but often too in@@ ventive .
the attacks were in@@ stituted too often on the left side of Douglas Costa , which rarely came through against the former O@@ mar El@@ ab@@ d@@ ell@@ a@@ ou@@ i from the former Braunschwei@@ ger O@@ mar El@@ ab@@ d@@ ell@@ a@@ ou@@ i .
Müller had more luck from the right , when his flan@@ k came from the right half field in the left upper tor@@ ment .
in the 6@@ 7th minute the world champion for@@ gave the possible 2 : 0 .
Robert Lew@@ and@@ owski had the best opportunities in half a year .
first of all , when Olympi@@ ac@@ os @-@ Stür@@ mer Ide@@ ye Brown struck the Pol@@ es of the Pol@@ es from the line ( 26 ) .
then by a direct debit , the Tor@@ wart Roberto was par@@ ked with his knee ( 3@@ 5. ) .
even though Bavaria had its usual dominant play , Pi@@ ra@@ eus could put con@@ i@@ fer stit@@ ches .
on door@@ keepers Manuel Neu@@ er , however , was reli@@ eved .
for example , when he drew a shot of ide@@ o@@ ye about the Lat@@ te ( 5@@ 6th ) .
before Neu@@ er Guardi@@ ola left a four @-@ chain with David Al@@ aba in the centre next to Jer@@ ome Bo@@ at@@ eng who made it well .
Mario Götz@@ e , after muscular problems back in the ca@@ der , sat outside .
the World Cup hero was given the green light only after the final training , &quot; said sports director Matthias Sam@@ mer at &quot; Sky &quot; : &quot; if you want to make something different from it , this is malign@@ ant . &quot;
also at the first change , Guardi@@ ola decided against him when he brought King@@ sley Com@@ an to the slain Lew@@ and@@ owski ( 59@@ . ) .
id@@ ol@@ at@@ ry arrived late for Ar@@ tur@@ o Vi@@ dal ( 7@@ 6th ) and made it clear 13 minutes later .
in front of the game it had come to the stadium in the stadium .
after a smaller group of war@@ med Bayern fans apparently provoked the supporters of Pi@@ ra@@ eus with words and gest@@ ures , the security forces attacked and attacked the Munich supporters .
at least one Bayern @-@ Fan was injured and transported from the stadium .
smo@@ kes , has a higher risk of losing teeth
who smo@@ kes , har@@ ms not only the lungs , but also the teeth - that suggests a Potsdam long @-@ term study .
the good news : when reno@@ unc@@ ing , the risk is reduced quickly .
smo@@ kers have a significantly increased risk of losing their teeth early .
this results from the long @-@ term study of an international research team , including several employees of the German Institute for Nutri@@ tional Research ( DI@@ f@@ E ) in Potsdam .
compared to non @-@ smo@@ kers , smo@@ kers had the risk of losing their teeth pre@@ mat@@ urely in order to increase the 2.@@ 5@@ - to 3,@@ 6 times higher .
the scientists observed more than 23@@ 300 participants .
root causes for tooth decay are decay and inflammation of the gum , emphasizes the DI@@ f@@ E .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for these perio@@ don@@ ti@@ tis smoking is a risk factor , emphas@@ ise the authors . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the connection between smoking and tooth loss is therefore reduced to more frequent gin@@ gi@@ vi@@ tis in smo@@ kers .
it is not clear to what extent smoking increases the risk of c@@ aries .
people who quit smoking could reduce their risk but within a short time , the researchers write in the &quot; Journal of Dental Research . &quot;
however , it could take over ten years until the endanger@@ ing again sin@@ ks to the level of non @-@ smoking , first author Thomas Dietrich from the English University of Birmingham .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; people must convince people to become non @-@ smo@@ kers , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained study manager H@@ einer Boeing from DI@@ f@@ E : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; smoking shor@@ tens the lifetime . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
not smoking is good for lungs and vessels and also leads to good dental health up to the old age .
in Germany , over 20 percent of the population in the age of 65 to 74 years are affected by tooth@@ lessness , the DI@@ f@@ E shared with .
earlier studies have already pointed out that smoking increases the risk of early tooth loss .
the new long @-@ term study under@@ lines the findings .
archae@@ ologists stum@@ ble on rem@@ n@@ ants from the late Anti@@ quity at the Rhein@@ u@@ fer in Cologne
for the repeated time , archaeological findings have been made on the right bank of the Rhine in Cologne .
in the vicinity of the construction site for the new Rhine bou@@ levard , archae@@ ologists of the Roman @-@ German@@ ic @-@ Museum skel@@ et@@ ons and rem@@ n@@ ants of historical buildings excav@@ ated , said Museum Director Marcus Trier on Tuesday .
since the beginning of construction works on the Rhine , histori@@ ans are searching for so @-@ called soil monuments .
in all construction projects in the city district of Cologne , the museum is always referred to as the Department of Archae@@ ological Natural Monument Care .
in the third part of the Rhine Boulevard , archae@@ ologists have now found five .
text documents have already been known that in the 4th century a fortress and in the 8th century have stood a church , Trier explained .
in addition to the remains of the fortress and the church tower , there was also a cemetery with around 350 graves that belonged to the church .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the EU Commission has proposed a comprehensive reform of the current arbit@@ ration system for the determination of the dispute over the planned Trans@@ atlan@@ tic Trade Agreement ( TT@@ IP ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the controversial private arbit@@ ration institutions for disputes between companies and states should therefore be replaced by a more transparent system equivalent to more traditional dishes in its functioning .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to set up a system that citizens dare , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the responsible EU Commissioner Ceci@@ lia Malm@@ ström during the performance . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Swe@@ de proposed introducing the proposal as a European negotiating position in the free trade talks with the US . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the German government announced support .
TT@@ IP aims to create the largest free trade zone in the world with 800 million people .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the plans for the reform of the current arbit@@ ration proceedings stipul@@ ate that the EU and the US will jointly select independent judges for a new Investment Court . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they should come to equal parts from the EU , the US and third countries . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a second instance is fores@@ een for the first time .
it would allow obj@@ ections to be obj@@ ected against judgments .
until now , the parties involved agreed on arbit@@ rators , an obj@@ ection to their judgment did not exist .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the discussion of recent months it has become clear that citizens of the old IS@@ DS system in terms of fair@@ ness and justice did not trust , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Malm@@ ström commented . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the long term , it wants to work towards an International Investment Court according to its own specifications .
there could then be clari@@ fied conflicts between Chinese companies and EU states , for example .
the investor @-@ state arbit@@ ration proceedings ( IS@@ DS ) , above all , are considered one of the main reasons for the great opposition in Europe against TT@@ IP .
the traditional arbit@@ ration tri@@ bun@@ als are critic@@ ised by opponents as a sort of parall@@ el@@ ism in which the tax@@ pay@@ ers are able to pay compensation to tax@@ pay@@ ers , le@@ verage national legislation or en@@ force a reduction in consumer and environmental standards .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the first comments anti @-@ TT@@ IP organizations such as Camp@@ act described the proposals of the European Commission as inadequate . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was above all critic@@ ised that they should not apply to the already negotiated free trade agreement with Canada ( C@@ eta ) .
the German economic secretary Matthias Mach@@ nig ( SPD ) , on the other hand , described the plans as great progress .
the Commission took into account key points in the reform that the Federal Minister of Economics Sig@@ mar Gabriel worked with other EU trade ministers in the spring .
the old system of private arbit@@ ration courts is from the table .
the French government also welcomed the plans of Malm@@ ström .
the European company B@@ US@@ IN@@ ES@@ S@@ EURO@@ PE warned against restric@@ ting the economic action of the economy by too many new rules .
especially small and medium @-@ sized enterprises could be dis@@ advant@@ aged .
when the talks on the TT@@ IP ( Trans@@ atlan@@ tic Trade and Investment Partnership ) agreement can be concluded , it remained unclear on Wednesday .
the negotiations have been running since mid @-@ 2013 .
however , the issue of investor protection has not been discussed with the US .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; originally , a framework for the agreement should be at the end of this year . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this date is regarded as un@@ sustainable .
delicate Folk of Su@@ f@@ jan St@@ ev@@ ens in Hamburg
eleven years ago Su@@ f@@ jan St@@ ev@@ ens sits on stage in the Cologne Prime Club ( today : Lux@@ or ) .
next to him is a fli@@ p@@ chart , on which the timi@@ dly acting folk singer has recorded the picturesque US state Mich@@ igan with felt @-@ pin .
the entire audience , about 40 people , is almost captured by St@@ ev@@ ens &apos;s lecture .
he tells the story of various places he always records on the map , about his meticul@@ ous and delicate arranged songs .
where they came from and how it looks there , in his homeland .
since then St@@ ev@@ ens has proven to be a wonderful creative Ir@@ rer .
the 2003 and third album &quot; Gre@@ etings from Mich@@ igan : the Great Lake State &quot; seem to be smart composed songs that harmon@@ i@@ ously close to American folk of the late six@@ ties , but at any time drift to opul@@ ent opul@@ ent songs .
it is rum@@ oured that &quot; Mich@@ igan &quot; would be the first part of a bold series : each of the 50 US states should be sung in a row .
but already in 2004 and near the Rhine , &quot; Seven Sw@@ ans &quot; has already appeared and has a positive effect on expectations .
St@@ ev@@ ens is reduced here .
live with him guitar and ban@@ jo .
a year later , the musician who lives in New York returns to the series .
with &quot; Illinois &quot; ( &quot; Su@@ f@@ jan St@@ ev@@ ens Inv@@ ites You To : come on Fe@@ el The Il@@ lin@@ oise &quot; ) a nationwide masterpiece appears in 2005 .
captiv@@ ating ideas and styli@@ stic fin@@ esse .
the album entered the American Bill@@ board charts and is not missing in any yearly list of the influential music media .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after extremely productive experim@@ entation , St@@ ev@@ ens then relies on &quot; The Age of Ad@@ ore &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( 2010 ) very extensive electronic components . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this sixth studio album is still broad@@ ly orchest@@ rated , but carried by programmed sequences or beats and plays with all sorts of effects and rever@@ ber@@ ation .
far from the smaller clubs , the stage shows are shown here for the colourful spectacle of ne@@ on head@@ bands and big fluorescent stage de@@ co .
Su@@ f@@ jan St@@ ev@@ ens is currently touring as part of a five @-@ member band through Germany .
in the dark held Hamburg More !
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he mainly presents the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Car@@ rie &amp; Low@@ ell &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; available since March . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
even though there are almost 2000 guests sitting in their chairs , the clearly ripe St@@ ev@@ ens returns to in@@ timacy and folk .
without judging the audience , the group plays an excellent musician through the broad @-@ enriched album .
you hear from the audience : the lecture is &quot; opul@@ ent &quot; and you can basically throw away the &quot; album . &quot;
first of all St@@ ev@@ ens would like to thank St@@ ev@@ ens , playing acousti@@ cally few older songs and finally dec@@ lines under thunder@@ ous applause .
Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s debut at the Fra@@ c@@ unde of the Prime Minister
since his election Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s debut is expected with suspen@@ se of the Prime Minister
the new Labour leader Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ n will be making his debut at the Fra@@ c@@ unde of the Prime Minister and for the first time put up with David Cameron .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n will rise to make the first of his six prescribed questions shortly after noon , whereby his performance is likely to be examined by the media and the Labour MEPs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he called for &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; less theatre and more facts &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at this weekly event . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he also said that he could skip some sessions to leave them to colleagues .
the meeting will be the first parliamentary review for Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s leadership , as it comes after his appointment as a member of the Shadow Cab@@ inet and after his speech at the TU@@ C Annual Meeting on Tuesday .
in the meantime , the Labour leader &apos;s decision to remain silent on Tuesday during the singing of the National An@@ them during a commemor@@ ative celebration of the 7@@ 5th anniversary of the Battle of Britain , provoked a criticism of a number of T@@ ory @-@ MPs and is at the heart of several title pages in the newspapers .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s decision not to sing the national an@@ them has attracted attention
a spokes@@ man by Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said he was &quot; in respect@@ ful silence &quot; and he recognized the &quot; hero@@ ism of the Royal Air Force in the Battle of England . &quot;
but a member of Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s Shadow Cab@@ inet , O@@ wen Smith , told the Labour leader to sing the national an@@ them , &quot; independently &quot; of his belief that the monarchy should be aboli@@ shed .
nearly a dozen of shadow ministers have refused to serve in Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s top team , and they are called upon differences in the economy , defence and foreign policy , while less than a sixth of the Par@@ liam@@ entary party originally supported him as a leader .
the Political Cor@@ respon@@ dent of the BBC Robin Bran@@ t says that political differences can also be st@@ acking within Labour , &quot; according to Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s statements on the position of the European Union and the limitation with profits .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said the TU@@ C conference that Labour made changes to remove the whole idea of a limit altogether .
hours later , Mr Smith , the shadow @-@ working and pensions @-@ minister said that the party was &quot; very clear &quot; that it was only against the government plans to reduce the limit of 26@@ ,000 pounds to 23@@ ,000 pounds .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n will be the fifth Labour leader David Cameron , since he is T@@ ory boss , over the last decade of the dis@@ patch cabinet across the Parliament .
the Labour President , who has promised another policy approach , says he has &quot; Crow@@ d @-@ sour@@ ced &quot; ideas for Mr Cameron &apos;s questions and gave him more than 30.000 suggestions .
the Is@@ lington North MP has said that the Fra@@ mas of the Prime Minister is too con@@ front , and that he will refra@@ in from &quot; dr@@ unk@@ enness &quot; and stri@@ kers with ad@@ versaries instead of concentr@@ ating on serious problems such as poverty , ine@@ quality and the challenges for young people .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said that Angela Eagle , the shadow economic minister , will represent him if he does not participate - for example when Mr Cameron is travelling abroad .
he also introduced the idea that other colleagues occasionally take the word , and that he spoke to John Ber@@ cow , the spokes@@ man of the lower house , to discuss the problem .
when he became a leader in 2005 , Mr Cameron said he wanted to remove himself from politics in the style of a &quot; Ju@@ dy Show , &quot; often associated with the Prime Minister &apos;s question@@ ings . but some years later he admitted that he failed .
since it was first broad@@ cast@@ ed on TV in 1990 , the Fra@@ mas with the Prime Minister was considered the most important bar@@ ometer of the judgment of a leader and his leadership in the House of Comm@@ ons and his position among his parliam@@ ent@@ arians , although critics have argued that they have become a car@@ ic@@ ature and need far @-@ reaching reforms .

pound increases by accelerated wage growth in the United Kingdom
the pound increased sharply to data showing an increase in the UK &apos;s wage growth . parallel to this , the FT@@ SE 100 was increased by the bid target SA@@ BM@@ iller .
between May and July , earnings without bonuses in the UK grew by 2.@@ 9 % compared to the same period of the previous year .
this percentage has been the fastest and raised assessments on the date of an increase in interest rates since 2009 .
the pound increased by more than 1 % compared to the dollar to $ 1,@@ 5@@ 50@@ 5 and was climbed by 0.@@ 84 % compared to the euro to 1.@@ 37@@ 30 € .
the FT@@ SE 100 index ended with an increase of 1.@@ 49 % to 6.@@ 2@@ 29@@ ,@@ 21 .
SA@@ BM@@ iller was the outstanding share on the market and made a jump of 20 % after tak@@ eover offer of the Ri@@ val AB In@@ Be@@ v was received .
a transaction would combine the world &apos;s two largest bre@@ wer@@ ies and bring together brands such as Bud@@ weiser , Stella Ar@@ to@@ is , Per@@ oni and Gro@@ l@@ sch .
Bur@@ berry shares were higher after encouraging news from the competition group for luxury goods Rich@@ em@@ ont 0.@@ 9 % higher .
Rich@@ em@@ on@@ ts latest sales figures beat all expectations and showed that sales in China - a key market for Bur@@ berry - reported growth again .
shares of Gl@@ en@@ core rose 5 % after the mining giant said he took 2.5 billion $ by a stock sales as part of his debt reduction strategy .
the shares in the Mon@@ di packaging and paper group were the largest los@@ ers on the index , with a decline of 4.3 % after Gold@@ man Sach@@ s had set his app@@ rais@@ al for the company rating on &quot; sell . &quot;
J@@ D Sports increased 3.1 % after the sports clothing company reported a pre @-@ tax profit of 4@@ 6.@@ 6 million for the first half of the year .
the boss of J@@ D Sports says higher wages would je@@ op@@ ardi@@ ze expansion .
the managing director of J@@ D Sports Peter Cow@@ g@@ ill says that a higher minimum wage for UK workers could be &quot; more purchasing power in the pockets of potential customers . &quot;
but it is unlikely that this purchasing power will compensate for the higher labour costs for his company , he says .
the cost could meet the expansion plans of J@@ D Sports , he added , and that could mean there are fewer additional jobs .
Jus@@ tin Bie@@ ber in the capital : on Bie@@ ber expedition in Berlin
Jus@@ tin Bie@@ ber , Meg@@ ast@@ ar .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; L@@ itt@@ y 21 years young , a hanging with a top @-@ layer f@@ rise . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the type with plat@@ inum bl@@ ond hair is 100 million euros heavy .
rather even more .
at present , Mon@@ si@@ eur Bie@@ ber is in Berlin .
and the generation U@@ 17 is spinning .
like Wi@@ k@@ tori@@ a Ru@@ d@@ zin@@ ska .
the 15 @-@ year @-@ old has never heard the name &quot; R@@ itz Carl@@ ton . &quot;
not bad .
hundreds of fans accompanied Jus@@ tin yesterday .
among them E@@ wa and Vik@@ tori@@ a from Poland .
since 7 o &apos;clock in the morning , however , the Pol@@ on sits on the cold stone s@@ labs of the Berlin luxury hotel at Pots@@ dam@@ er Platz .
the Bie@@ ber construction : here you live i@@ dol , whose posters hang in St@@ et@@ tin , since Monday evening .
the suite in which the Canadian singer lives , costs exactly as much as her mother E@@ wa deserves in half a year .
if at all .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she says , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; actually my Wi@@ k@@ tori@@ a would have to sit in the 10th grade in the gymn@@ asi@@ um . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I fulfil her a dream . &quot;
compulsory scho@@ oling ?
who is it@@ ching ?
the fans don &apos;t .
not even Bie@@ ber himself .
it has taken care of it anyway .
for the advertisement in the promotional period of the Super@@ market , he cas@@ hed three million , a two @-@ year deal with an anti @-@ p@@ im@@ ple company flus@@ hed many , many dollars on the Bie@@ ber account .
and with every doll that looks like he and about the counter , Bie@@ ber also cas@@ ca@@ des .
when Jus@@ tin Bie@@ ber drinks a coffee , you are amazed at the window disc .
he is said to have captured more than 100 million people .
some say , the hyp@@ e went too far .
others stress that Bie@@ ber is finally in the USA and the UK with his new single &quot; What do you mean ? &quot; ranked # 1 .
Bie@@ ber himself , whose fourth album is to follow in November , are not interested in the many zer@@ os .
at least he does this way .
PE@@ GI@@ DA @-@ poster brings Leban@@ ese to the idea of mas@@ hed potatoes
potatoes or twe@@ eter ?
it is both in the potato d@@ öner , which the Ol@@ den@@ burger I@@ mb@@ iss@@ owner Han@@ i Al@@ ha@@ y developed .
inspired by the &quot; potato instead of D@@ öner &quot; on a plac@@ ard of the Pe@@ gi@@ da movement Al@@ ha@@ y potato and meat have put together on a sk@@ ewer .
the idea brought him a poster in a Pe@@ gi@@ da demonstration with the inscription &quot; Pot@@ atoes instead of D@@ öner , &quot; which he had accidentally seen on television .
since then , there is a barbecue in his shop , which is equipped with meat and potatoes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is Mul@@ tik@@ ul@@ ti for the stomach , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Al@@ ha@@ y . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the meantime , the Leban@@ ese had the idea to register for the patent office in Munich .
according to the authority , it has recently been protected as a utility model .
as much meat and how much potatoes the sk@@ ewer contains , Al@@ ha@@ y does not want to betra@@ y .
only as much : &quot; it tastes better together , &quot; he finds .
culinary international understanding is also good for its customers .
Met@@ cash La@@ un@@ ches Resources Camp@@ aig@@ n to Com@@ bat Al@@ di@@ - In@@ fall
Met@@ cash is trying to protect the I@@ GA stores from an Al@@ di march in South Australia and Western Australia .
food wholes@@ aler Met@@ cash has launched a floor@@ standing campaign to defend the market share of the I@@ GA retailers in South Australia and Western Australia in advance of a $ 700 million Al@@ di invasion .
while Al@@ di prepared the opening of two sales centers and the first 120 shops in South Australia and Western Australia early next year , Met@@ cash and I@@ GA supermarkets strengthen their relationships with local food suppliers and build the I@@ GA brand through mainstream marketing and marketing about social media , as well as events such as Adel@@ ai@@ de @-@ Show .
Ig@@ A dealers and suppliers jump on board , with brands such as ice manufacturer S@@ immo from Dun@@ s@@ bor@@ ough , who distri@@ butes samples in I@@ GA stores and shop owners selling dis@@ counted tickets for the South Australian football league to loyal customers .
it is expected that Met@@ cash will publish further details of its defense strategy on September 29 , if the wholes@@ aler of food , alcohol and equipment performs its annual investor strategy day .
it is much in the game as South Australia and Western Australia accounts for nearly 30 percent of Met@@ a &apos;s I@@ GA stores and generate higher profit margins as Met@@ a &apos;s I@@ GA network in the eastern states .
buyers in South Australia and Western Australia are not@@ ori@@ ously provincial and I@@ GA retailers have a much stronger market share than in New South Wales , Victoria and Que@@ ens@@ land - more than 30 percent in South Australia and 24 percent in Western Australia compared to around 14 percent in the Eastern states .
however , analysts like Morgan Stan@@ ley believe that in the opening of its first markets , Al@@ di will take around five percent of the food market in these two states and take away all existing players , but mainly independent retailers .
according to a report published this week , the analy@@ st Tom K@@ ier@@ ath of Morgan Stan@@ ley estimates that I@@ GA retailers could lose 360 $ million turnover per year and Met@@ cash $ 250 million by the end of 2016 .
this pro@@ g@@ nosis is based on the assumption that Al@@ di in the next year will open 25 branches in SA and 30 in WA , and will generate sales of $ 500 million and $ 600 million in each market .
the loss in food and food business and amounts on Met@@ a &apos;s high fixed cost base could cost Met@@ cash around $ 13 million pre @-@ interest and tax profit , said Mr K@@ ier@@ ath .
at the same time , Met@@ cash loses market shares in the eastern states , mainly to Al@@ di and Col@@ es , although a recent survey by Roy Morgan found that I@@ GA buyers are the most loyal .
Morgan Stan@@ ley assumes that Met@@ a &apos;s sales in the food and food business fall by 3.8 percent in 2016 , by 4.1 percent in 2017 , and 2.1 percent in 2018 , and will reduce the market share of 14 percent by 2015 to 10.@@ 3 percent by 2020 .
last week , the leading fund manager Ham@@ ish Dou@@ glass , founder of the Mag@@ ell@@ an Financial Group , told a business dinner in Melbourne that Met@@ cash would likely disappear within a decade .
Met@@ cash declined to publicly respond to Mr Dou@@ glass &apos;s comments .
but it is assumed that a board member of Met@@ cash received contact with Mr Dou@@ glass last week .
since 2010 , i@@ G@@ AS market share has fallen from 18 percent to 14 percent , and revenues from Met@@ a &apos;s food and food trade , which supplies about 1,@@ 200 I@@ GA retailers , has fallen by 43 percent since 2012 , reflecting operational debt reduction for equal pressure on sales and margins .
the wholes@@ aler , however , resist@@ s and inv@@ ests more than 150 million dollars to equ@@ alize sales prices with col@@ es and Wo@@ ol@@ wor@@ ths in hundreds of products every week and to improve I@@ GA retailers in improving their stores by growing faster fresh food and delivering a better choice of private label foods .
Met@@ a &apos;s main managing director Ian Mor@@ rice says that the price adjustments and shop refur@@ bish@@ ment programs will grow to El@@ an and hopes that the wholes@@ aler will return to profit again in 2017 for the first time in four years .
Th@@ an@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is is supported by the president of the Australian tennis federation Steve He@@ aly
Th@@ an@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is deserves praise as criticism for his behaviour .
Th@@ an@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is was one of the &quot; coll@@ ateral damage &quot; in the recent storm around his friend Nick Kyr@@ gios , and , according to the president of the Australian tennis federation , Steve He@@ aly deserves praise as criticism for his own behavior .
Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is , the younger of the talented Du@@ os , which is often referred to as &quot; Special K@@ s , &quot; got ra@@ mp@@ ed through the in@@ famous confrontation of Kyr@@ gy@@ z with St@@ an Wa@@ wr@@ in@@ ka at the Montreal Masters .
in a fi@@ ery qualification game in C@@ inc@@ inn@@ ati soon Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is and his opponent Ry@@ an Har@@ rison had to be separated twice by the refer@@ ee , with Har@@ rison crying out : &quot; W@@ wr@@ in@@ ka would have sm@@ ashed the child , and I should beat the child . &quot;
while he was recently seen how he sm@@ ashed a tennis ra@@ cket after a cra@@ mp finished a potential US Open win by Richard Gas@@ quet , Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is was defended by He@@ aly .
the teen@@ ager is currently in Glasgow , competing with Sam Gr@@ oth around the second place in the zel behind Bernard Tom@@ ic in the Davis Cup semi @-@ fin@@ als against Britain .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a thing about which I am pretty rich is the fact that after my view , Th@@ an@@ asi was drawn into the conflict , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said He@@ aly . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he has broken a ra@@ cket when he lost a cra@@ mp in the US Open , but he is not the first player who has broken a ra@@ cket from fru@@ stration with himself , and I know Th@@ an@@ asi good enough to know that he is not proud of it .
but , really , he has beha@@ ved extremely well in the US Open , even under the rather pro@@ voc@@ ative circumstances with Har@@ rison and so on , and I think he deserves much recognition .
he has a great team around him , he has a great family around him , and I think he was treated a little too severely .
he is a very mature 19 @-@ year @-@ old , he works very hard and he goes into the team and so on , he has never had a problem with the other players , he is well in shape , he is well in shape , he is a very stable and mature young guy , and I think he deserves to be judged according to his own mer@@ its .
He@@ aly also supported the decision not to consider Kyr@@ gios on Friday , and he describes the &quot; common decision &quot; as the right one for all , but he ass@@ ures the man from Can@@ ber@@ ra to return as a long @-@ term fixed component to the team . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; first we wish that the team is completely focused on the competition and not all the controversi@@ es around &#91; Kyr@@ gy@@ z &#93; , &quot; said He@@ aly .
and I think that Nick was very quick to get out of what people like Feder@@ er and Mur@@ ray pointed out . he climb@@ s up in the eyes of the public , and he has made some bad mistakes and deserves all the criticism he gets , but we try to make him understand the consequences of his actions .
Europe &apos;s refugee crisis : Hungary declares emergency , closes the border , keeps refugees back
Hungary explains the emergency and ri@@ p@@ pled the southern border with Serbia on Tuesday and held all those trying to get illeg@@ ally into the country . all with the aim of stopping the influ@@ x of migrants .
chaos followed at the border when hundreds of migrants gathered in a Ni@@ em@@ and@@ land and re@@ acted Serbian officials with indignation .
the people who fled from violence ended up for an unknown time in a land strip on the road between the two control points of the countries and built tents and settled there .
but frustr@@ ations were rising .
when a police helicopter was ho@@ vering over them , the migrants &quot; opened the border ! &quot; and cried insul@@ ts against the Hungarian pro@@ visi@@ oning police .
some rejected food and water from protest .
Serbia &apos;s Foreign Minister stated that it was &quot; unacceptable &quot; that migrants from Hungary were sent back while more and more came from Macedonia and Greece .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( Serbia ) wants to be part of the solution and not a coll@@ ateral damage . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; talks with Brussels and other countries must take place in the coming days , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said I@@ vi@@ ca D@@ ac@@ ic in Prague . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the turbul@@ ence on the Hungarian @-@ Serbian border ended a day after the 28 @-@ Nations block at a disputed meeting in Brussels no common immigration policy could be agreed .
however , the ministers agreed to share responsibility for 40,000 people who were seeking refuge in the crowded Italy and Greece . they expressed their hope that the EU states would eventually receive another 120@@ ,000 refugees , including some from Hungary .
German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria requested a special summit of the European Union on Tuesday to discuss the immigration crisis of the continent .
but Hungary did not put its hopes on either Brussels or its neighbors .
the emergency room , which was run on Tuesday in two southern regions , gave authorities more powers to cope with the crisis , so that they could block roads and accelerate asylum procedures .
the Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter S@@ zi@@ j@@ jar@@ to stated that his country also plans to build a bar@@ bed wire fence along its border with Romania to stop the influ@@ x of migrants through the country after it has ended a fence on the Serbian border .
C@@ BS News correspon@@ dent Charlie D &apos;@@ Ag@@ ata reported that even prison in@@ mates were used in the race to create bar@@ bed wire fence between Hungary and Serbia .
in recent months Hungary has become a significant bott@@ len@@ eck and an entry point to the European Union for many war refugees from Syria and elsewhere in the Middle East .
however , Prime Minister Viktor Or@@ ban insist@@ ed that most of the incoming business refugees are looking for a better life , and not war refugees who are entitled to protection - a view strongly opposed to other EU countries , including Germany .
the new laws , which came into force at midnight in Hungary , make the crossing of the border or damaging the 4 @-@ meter ( 13 feet ) high fence that the government had built along the southern border with Serbia to a crime . these laws also impose higher prison sentences for convic@@ ted traffi@@ ckers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to the situation created by mass migration , the Hungarian government declares emergency , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; MEP Z@@ ol@@ tan K@@ ov@@ acs Repor@@ ters in the southern city of Sz@@ eg@@ ed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we say it very clearly : illegal border crossing is a crime . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Parliament must still agree with the use of the military , which is expected for next week , but repor@@ ters from Associated Press have already seen on the border heavily armed soldiers with vehicles and dogs for days .
Gy@@ or@@ gy Bak@@ on@@ di , country security advis@@ er for Or@@ ban , said that authorities caught 45 people in trying to cross the border , 15 others had already penet@@ rated deeper into the country .
they come across by damaging the fence , they are now in police custody and are accused of comm@@ itting crimes according to the new laws .
authorities are trying to repair the fence .
Hungarian officials also closed two of the seven border cross@@ ings with Serbia on Tuesday morning after a train wagon with bar@@ bed wire to close the borders had arrived .
chaos surrounded the most important border crossing near Ros@@ z@@ ke , Hungary , when Hungary opened a small office in a metal container to process the data of people and squee@@ ze a crowd to push themselves there .
about 20 managed to enter , but thousands remained outside .
another group of migrants blocked the most important highway connection between Serbia and Hungary and said that they would refuse food and water until they are allowed to enter Hungary .
election @-@ 2016 : H@@ illary Clinton &apos;s lead ahead of Ber@@ nie S@@ anders in national survey
the former US Secretary of State H@@ illary Clinton continues to hold a double @-@ digit advance in the democratic race for nom@@ ination at national level , but Sen@@ ator Ber@@ nie S@@ anders wins over against the ground .
Clinton now has the support of 47 percent of the democratic voters in the pre @-@ elections ( 58 percent earlier ) , while S@@ anders is second , with 27 percent ( rise by 17 percent ) .
vice @-@ President Joe Bi@@ den , who has not yet announced whether he is chann@@ elled for the pres@@ idency , receives support from 15 percent of the democratic voters of the prim@@ aries .
more than five months before the start of the elections , most democratic voters say that it is too early to say that their opinion determines which candidate they will support .
but Clinton &apos;s supporters are more consistent in their election than those of other candidates .
since the C@@ BS News survey Clinton has lost a number of demographic groups , while S@@ anders posted some gains .
Clinton has a big advantage in women and thir@@ ties , but these projections have dimin@@ ished .
their support for the men has declined significantly , and S@@ anders returns only with 5 points .
Clinton &apos;s advantage of democratic voters under the age of 50 has evapor@@ ated , and they and S@@ anders are now at the same level .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , Clinton has a great advantage over the older voters . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
last month Clinton was in front of S@@ anders with a double @-@ digit advance at the Liber@@ als , but S@@ anders now has a 5 @-@ point advantage in this group .
about half of the democratic voters of the pre @-@ elections say that they would support Clinton , if they were nominated by the party .
one quarter would support it with some reservations and another 15 percent would only support it because it is the candidate .
they would not support six percent .
perhaps not surprising that Clinton &apos;s current supporters are especially enthusiastic about her .
the views are more mixed with those who currently don &apos;t support Clinton - only about one quarter would love them enthusias@@ tically .
while 48 percent of the democratic voters of the prim@@ aries say that they support Clinton with enthusiasm , less Republi@@ can voters say this about their peak channel data Donald Tr@@ ump ( 35 percent ) .
when Clinton supporters are asked in an open question why they want it to be the candidate , the most common answer is that it has the right experience ( 16 percent ) , followed by the view that it is time that a woman president is ( 13 percent ) and that she is the best candidate for the job ( 10 percent ) .
Clinton &apos;s supporters also mentioned their connection with Bill Clinton ( 9 percent ) .
consent to dealing with the problems and the di@@ v@@ ability are also cited .
as the Vice President casts a potential for the pres@@ idency in the scales , 57 per cent of the democratic voters of the prim@@ aries would like to see him in the race - although a third believes he should not do it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if democratic voters of the prim@@ aries are asked who for the party would be their second choice , Bi@@ den is at the head . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
von Clinton &apos;s followers say more than half that Bi@@ den would be their second choice far ahead of S@@ anders .
if Bi@@ den decides not to fight for the nom@@ ination of the democr@@ ats , H@@ illary Clinton &apos;s edge is raised in front of S@@ anders , from 20 points with Bi@@ den in race to 30 points without him in the race .
fifty @-@ five percent of the democratic voters see Clinton as a candidate with the best chances of winning the election ; however , this figure has fallen from 78 percent last month .
Bi@@ den is a second in this measurement , but the percentage that sees it as the &quot; cho@@ ic@@ est &quot; has risen .
nevertheless , on the question of what is more important in a candidate , Democratic voters call questions about the choice of elec@@ torate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; similar to last month , no single democratic candidate or potential candidate for these voters stands out to be unacceptable . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Democratic candidates or potential candidates produce good results with some important tra@@ its in voters of the prim@@ aries of their party .
maj@@ orities consider Clinton , S@@ anders and Bi@@ den as honest and trust@@ worthy and equipped with strong leadership qualities .
Bi@@ den best deals with the three candidates for hon@@ esty , while Clinton &apos;s strength is the leadership .
thirty percent of the democratic voters do not believe Clinton is honest and trust@@ worthy , twice as many say this about S@@ anders ( 15 percent ) , but 27 percent do not believe him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; democratic voters in the prim@@ aries generally see Clinton , S@@ anders and Bi@@ den ide@@ ologically in accordance with their views . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for all these measurements , about a quarter of the democratic voters have no opinion of S@@ anders .
since questions about H@@ illary Clinton &apos;s use of a personal e @-@ mail address and a server during the term of office as foreign ministers continue to be questioned , most Democratic voters are satisfied with their statement of the matter and say that it has not influenced their opinions overall .
but it is another story in the American public altogether .
half of Americans are now dis@@ satisfied with their explanation , while only about a third is satisfied .
public opinion was split in March , shortly after the problem came to light .
most Americans said that the e @-@ mail controversy had no impact on Clinton &apos;s general opinion , although 36 percent said that their opinion was still wor@@ sen@@ ing .
there are mainly Republi@@ cans , more than six of 10 who say their views of Clinton became worse .
although Clinton is considered hon@@ estly and trust@@ worthy by the voters of her party , this continues to be a problem for her among registered voters : only 32 per cent see her as honest and trust@@ worthy , eight percent less than last month and 15 points less since May .
62 percent of voters do not hold them for an honest and trust@@ worthy person .
at the same time , 55 per cent of voters are not honest and un@@ trust@@ worthy .
however , Clinton and Tr@@ ump have good marks for guidance .
out of the six candidates , Bi@@ den , Car@@ son and Bush rank best with hon@@ esty .
a majority sees S@@ anders rather hon@@ estly , but as with Car@@ son many have no opinion of him .
the error rate for the sample of 3@@ 51 Democratic voters in the prim@@ aries is 6 percentage points .
Ben Car@@ son puts near Donald Tr@@ ump on a nationwide survey
Ben Car@@ son is in the latest survey of C@@ BS News / New York Times densely behind Donald Tr@@ ump
half of the voters &apos; support in the new survey is no longer necessary for the two candidates , and others will lose their grip dramatically .
Republi@@ can voters still support Tr@@ ump in large numbers nationwide . support is growing from 23 % in the last C@@ BS survey conducted in front of Fox News Deb@@ ate last month , by 27 % in the survey on Tuesday .
but Car@@ son shot from 6 % to 23 % in the same period .
the survey also revealed that Car@@ son in demo@@ graphics groups is well received and Tr@@ ump exceeds Republi@@ can voters with higher education .
the rest of the field , with the exception of Car@@ ly Fi@@ or@@ ina and Ohio Gover@@ nor John Ka@@ sich , is beaten with Wis@@ cons@@ ins Gover@@ nor Scott Walker , who is the deepest , and 10 % support last month to now 2 % .
former Gover@@ nor J@@ eb Bush , former Gover@@ nor of Ar@@ kan@@ s@@ as Mike Hu@@ ck@@ ab@@ ee and Florida Sen@@ ator Marco Ru@@ bio , are in third place at 6 % .
the error margin in the sample of 3@@ 76 people from Republi@@ can voters in this latest survey is Plus or Min@@ us 6 % and was conducted in September .
the latest CN@@ N / OR@@ C survey , which was published last week , shows that Car@@ son climb@@ s in the surveys - with 19 % support from the Republi@@ cans , behind the Tr@@ ump with 32 % support .
the latest news from ABC News / Washington Post also showed Tr@@ ump in front of Car@@ son .
with a view to a Car@@ son rising in the last week , Tr@@ ump found some si@@ eves for the former neuro@@ surgeon , even after Car@@ son ap@@ ologi@@ zed to question Tr@@ um@@ ps &apos;s faith .
&quot; we need energy , &quot; said Tr@@ ump last Saturday during a campaign show in I@@ owa .
pleasant bathing temperatures : the eastern Mediterranean is currently up to 29 degrees warm .
even if peak values are measured only in the distance , a trip to the Mediterranean is enough for bathing vac@@ ation@@ ers to find even hot water .
a bath in the North Sea or Baltic Sea is likely to be a rather short pleasure with a maximum of 17 degrees .
some people are no longer going into the sea : at maximum 18 degrees the water in the North Sea and the Baltic Sea in this week , the German Weather Service ( DW@@ D ) shares with .
on the other hand , bathing temperatures still offer the Mediterranean : in the east it is even up to 29 degrees .
in the Adriatic it is at the top 25 degrees , in France 23 degrees .
the Red Sea in Egypt comes to 28 degrees .
five members of the Brotherhood bur@@ dened with the death of Bar@@ uch College newcom@@ ers
almost two years after a student died during a hur@@ ri@@ cane ritual of a student connection in Po@@ con@@ o Mountains , Pennsylvania , murder accus@@ ations were submitted against five persons .
members of the New York Bar@@ uch College P@@ i @-@ Delta @-@ P@@ si bro@@ therhood attacked Ch@@ un &quot; Michael &quot; Den@@ g during an introduc@@ tory ceremony in September 2013 brut@@ ally and delayed his transport to the hospital , which contributed to his death , shared the police with .
officials said that he was loaded with blin@@ d@@ folded eyes with a 30 @-@ pound back@@ pack full of sand , and repeatedly attacked while he tried to go over a frozen field to a goal .
Mr. Den@@ g compl@@ ained about head@@ aches , then he fell un@@ conscious .
the members of the P@@ i @-@ Delta @-@ P@@ si Brotherhood didn &apos;t call the emergency number 911 after Den@@ g was power@@ less , waiting for an hour before they brought him to a hospital , so the police .
however , they had the time to change D@@ eng@@ s &apos;s clothing , goo@@ gle his symptoms and contact Andy Men@@ g , the national president of the Brotherhood , to seek advice , said Poli@@ ti@@ ff Chris Wagner at a press conference .
&quot; at this point the members began to hide utensils and set the well @-@ being of the Brotherhood in general about that of Michael Den@@ g , &quot; said Poli@@ gra@@ ef Wagner .
he could not be revi@@ ved , and the next morning he died of his injuries .
after an aut@@ op@@ sy report Den@@ g was repeatedly added to the head , body and th@@ igh with bl@@ unt force .
&quot; too many families have been destroyed by the Brotherhood of the Brotherhood . at least one student dies in the ch@@ ic@@ ane every year since 1970 , &quot; said Douglas Fi@@ er@@ berg , a lawyer who represents D@@ eng@@ s &apos;s family in an explanation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; bro@@ ther@@ hoods and their members must be held accoun@@ table , and this step by authorities is very important . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a County Grand Jury of Mon@@ ro@@ e recommended an indictment for murder of the third grade for the first five members .
thirty @-@ two members of the Brotherhood , including Mr Men@@ g , are also indic@@ ted for false attacks and the formation of a criminal association .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we do not only want to be responsible for the persons involved , but if there is an organization that has been sanc@@ tioned - officially or un@@ officially - that is what we will take account of . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wagner at a press conference on Tuesday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Bar@@ uch College has banned the Brotherhood , and the national bro@@ therhood has rev@@ oked its affili@@ ation to the local community .
this will happen if the F@@ ed increases interest rates
an increase in interest comes , and the domestic trip will be subsi@@ dis@@ ed , yields for bonds will rise , and the economy will slide into recession .
we know that .
what we don &apos;t know is how long it will last and how long it will stop .
in particular , the history of the economy offers only little guidance to the process .
a recession came within just 11 months after the first rate of interest and lasted 86 months .
the aggres@@ si@@ veness of the Federal Reserve in raising interest rates is often , al@@ beit not always , a factor in how the economy and financial investments react .
therefore representatives of the US Central Bank have strongly emphasized that investors should not concentrate when it begins to increase interest rates , but rather on the period required for normal@@ isation .
in fact , several variables play a role .
however , in the end market participants could find that the whole excitement might be exagger@@ ated because of an increase in interest rates .
&quot; the first increase in the F@@ ed since the global financial crisis will inevitably be interpreted by some as a signal for the end of the &quot; cheap money &quot; era , &quot; said Julian Jes@@ so@@ p , Chief Econom@@ ist at Capital Economics , in a communication to customers .
in contrast , we do not expect the gradual return of US interest to normal heights , but still at a low level to lead to sei@@ s@@ mic shock that many seem to fear .
this does not mean that there will be no effect .
here is a view based on historical trends that could react to some areas of the economy :
as the market has seen last month , the anticip@@ ation of interest increases can make things volati@@ le for a while .
as soon as the increase occurs , the impact is not so dramatic .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there seems to be a tendency that assets can be offset 12 to 24 months after the first increase , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Deutsche Bank analysts in a recent study on what happens after the interest rate of the F@@ ed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
more specifically , the market is usually upward trend in the past 35 years - about 14 percent - on the way to increase interest rates , fairly flat in the 250 days thereafter ( average gain of 2.6 percent ) , then back to normal state after 500 days , with an average return in the past six previous cycles of 14.@@ 4 percent , according to a current analysis , which Bob D@@ oll , chief facility manager at Nu@@ ve@@ en Asset Management , published at Bar@@ ron &apos;s .
Deutsche Bank said that the impact on the shares tends to occur later in the increases cycle and the return on investment begins to decrease .
rec@@ essions are a fact of economic life , but interest increases often promote it .
in the current case , the F@@ ed is confronted with some conditions that could not exist before and which could accelerate the recession .
it is extremely not@@ e@@ worthy that the gross domestic product will be near its lowest point at an interest rate of the F@@ ed .
according to Deutsche Bank , in the case of the 118 interest rate increases since 1950 , only twice the nominal GDP was below 4.5 percent .
although the second quarter of 2015 was 3.6 percent , few expect this to continue and expect only 1.5 percent for the third quarter , according to the Atlanta F@@ ed .
interest increases in such fragile economic setting could be ris@@ ky and raise the question as to whether it is different this time , &quot; said Deutsche Bank .
market players have taken a net interest rate of the F@@ ed all year round , and all eyes were addressed to the meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee this week , which ends on Thursday .
while many strate@@ gi@@ sts and econom@@ ists believe that the FO@@ MC could appro@@ ve an increase in this session , the fut@@ ures trading gives only a chance of 25 percent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in our study , all elev@@ ations cycles from 1950 to today have taken place in a super @-@ cycle with increasing momentum in GDP and pre @-@ rec@@ es@@ sion@@ ary heights very quickly put into the shadow after the start of recovery , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the report . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in contrast , this is a clearly slow recovery from what was the worst recession in the observed phase .
the current cycle is by far the longest which the F@@ ed has been waiting since the end of the last recession ; the record was 35 months , and this has been 74 months so far .
fixed income was also volati@@ le , as the market anticip@@ ates an increase in interest rates , and the pattern is quite similar to that of the capital market .
the main difference is that the effect of bonds is faster than in shares if they change their strategic course .
bonds seem to change direction as soon as the first increase / decrease occurs in the cycle .
at the end of the climb @-@ cycle , the bond @-@ endi@@ ces fall immediately , said the Deutsche Bank .
the strate@@ gi@@ sts of Charles Sch@@ wa@@ b believe that the rise in interest rates will result in yields coming closer together between longer and shorter bonds and lead to a fl@@ atten@@ ing of the curve .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; high @-@ interest bonds often bring superior yields in such a climate , although &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are still cau@@ tious to expect higher yields , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Kath@@ y Jones , fixed @-@ income analy@@ st at Sch@@ wa@@ b , in an analysis . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is interesting , says Jones , that the markets have already adapted to F@@ ed strategy expectations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition to the strength of the dollar and the decline in inflation expectations , there are some indications that the market has adapted to the prospect of more stringent monetary policy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
short @-@ term interest has risen , the earning curve is fl@@ atter , lending margins have wi@@ dened and volati@@ lity has risen - all features of the market when the F@@ ed tigh@@ tened its strategy .
in the large and whole , companies that deal with the greater part of their business activities in the US will benefit when interest rates rise and local products become more attractive .
multinational companies with high debts will be worse , as an increase in dollars makes their products more expensive in the global market and also the financing of their debts .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; history shows that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; quality &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; shares tend to react extremely positively three months after initial interest rate , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gold@@ man Sach@@ s analysts said in a report for the customers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
companies with a strong balance sheet have exceeded by 5 percentage points on average after each of the interest rate increases in 1994 , 1999 and 2004 .
companies with high capital returns and low volati@@ lity in their shares also exceeded their lower quality counter@@ parts by 4 ( percentage points ) and 3 ( percentage points ) .
debts will be a big issue .
companies with a high share of flexible interest will lose most , Gold@@ man said .
outside of pure share games , consumers will also benefit from the rising dollars .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; savers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; savings can be seen by higher earnings , even if experts are of different opinions how quickly this will take place . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
BBC Radio 3 is a copy of the Classic FM , says Par@@ liam@@ entary Member Andrew B@@ ing@@ ham
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Conserv@@ ative Member of Parliament critic@@ ised the channel because of its &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; arrest &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he ar@@ gues that he is increasingly not distingu@@ ish@@ able from commercial ri@@ vals .
he also quoted the BBC Music Awards and said that they only im@@ itated The Br@@ its
Parliament @-@ colleague Dam@@ ien Coll@@ ins attacked the broadcast The Voice and said that this was not very original .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; BBC Radio 3 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; converts &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Classic FM , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; maintains a leading parliament member and raises new pressure on the transmitter to prove that he does something that the private transm@@ it@@ ters do not do . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Conserv@@ ative MP Andrew B@@ ing@@ ham also said the BBC @-@ Bos@@ ses that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stupid &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and increasingly no longer be distinguished from its commercial competitors . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; radio 3 seems - I don &apos;t like to use the word &quot; sil@@ ly &quot; - but it seems to turn to Classic FM , &quot; he said .
he also quoted the BBC Music Awards , which started last December .
the BBC Music Awards , which started last year , appear to be just under another name The Br@@ its .
so if you try to do something else - these are two spontaneous examples where you can only im@@ itate what is already on the market , &quot; Mr B@@ ing@@ ham said .
BBC Radio Director rejected the alleg@@ ations and argued that BBC Radio 3 was far ahead of its commercial competitors when it comes to public music and public education .
what I &apos;m learning from Radio 3 , I won &apos;t learn about classical music anywhere else .
and there is a commitment to live music and music that is truly un@@ sur@@ passed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and the commitment of Radio 3 to find new music and to commission new works is really important , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the beginning of this year , BBC Radio 3 Controller Alan Dav@@ ey argued that he had to work harder to engage the audience as it did in the past because the British were less informed about classical music .
however , Radio 3 was not the only element of BBC production , which during the hearing in the Committee on the selection of culture , media and sport was under fire to tramp@@ le on the commercial ri@@ vals .
the T@@ ory MP Dam@@ ien Coll@@ ins attacked The Voice - the BBC &apos;s musical talent show , which was bought by the Dutch producer T@@ alp@@ a Media for an estimated cost of £ 22 million .
do you see why this program is often discussed because it is not original and not particularly striking ?
Lord Hall insist@@ ed that the BBC 1 show - with Pal@@ oma Faith and Boy George as Ju@@ dge - was &quot; produced in a special BBC way . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he added , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he would like the company to find &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a hit from our in @-@ house stall &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when it starts the next time an entertainment series . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , he refused to exclude the order from other series of The Voice in the future or to give money to the fee @-@ pay@@ ers for other entertainment formats .
Internet sales in August on the slow@@ est and Black Friday can be responsible for it
in the first three months of 2015 , there were seven percent increase in online sales .
last month there was the lowest result since the beginning of records in 2000
online sales increased three years ago by using mobile phones for shopping
experts believe that Black Friday has slow@@ ed the issues in November
for over a decade , the virtual shopping has bo@@ oted , and many of Britain &apos;s main shopping streets have turned into gh@@ ost cities .
but experts say that there are signs now that online sales stagn@@ ate after new figures showed only seven percent in the first three months of 2015 .
the total expenditure for August represented the lowest increase in growth since the beginning of records in 2000 , with only five percent increase compared to the previous year .
experts say that there are signs that online sales stagn@@ ate after new numbers showed only seven percent growth in the first three months of 2015
&quot; if you look at the growth rates for the previous years and go back to 2000 , then that has always evolved over time , &quot; said Andy Mul@@ c@@ ah@@ y , editor of the IM@@ R@@ G sales index of the Guardian .
he explained that the online sales increased three years ago when buyers started making purchases with their mobile phones .
it meant that more people could shop online and that people could do this in different environments , e.g. at home on the sofa .
but now that is a swing , and we may experience that growth is dimin@@ ished .
the Black Friday phenomenon imported from America is cited as a reason for the decreasing turnover .
experts believe that buyers will hold their purchases back before this event , which will take place on the last Friday of November .
last year , five times the average number of buyers revol@@ ved around their computers to make their bar@@ gains , and some dealer sites crashed .
experts believe that Black Friday , on which the buyers fought for bar@@ gains , could prevent buyers from making purchases .
a study by the British Retail Con@@ sortium found out that £ 5 £ was spent online by £ 5 .
for some products , such as TV and washing machines , more than one third of purchases are now carried out via web shops .
at the same time more than a quarter of people bu@@ ys clothing and shoes online instead of in the fashion chains in the inner cities .
Muslims bury the killed in Mec@@ ca in the crane accident - Bin Laden &apos;s family is sanc@@ tioned
the bodies of 29 dead are carried by Muslims in the first bur@@ ial pris@@ ons in Mec@@ ca through the streets .
Saudi Arabia partially dis@@ covers the collapse of the huge Saudi bin Laden batch
the Ministry of Health said that a total of 3@@ 94 people were injured after the crane collap@@ sed .
hundreds of Muslims gathered when 29 of the victims were carried through the streets to bury the slain who were killed when a crane collap@@ sed in Mec@@ ca &apos;s grandfather .
mour@@ ning @-@ filled , largely dressed in white , the route to clo@@ the their respect when the first of the dead joined their last trip to the Al @-@ Renaissance cemetery .
the procession passed on to the Holy Place where only days had been a building crane through the ceiling of the mos@@ que and then rus@@ hed onto the bed .
the bodies were approved for the funeral , when the Saudi king talked about the construction company of the Bin Laden &apos;s family because of the disaster that left 3@@ 94 wounded , a sanc@@ tion .
the cor@@ p@@ ses of 29 people who were killed when a crane collap@@ sed through the Great central mos@@ que of Mec@@ ca were carried through the streets .
among the dead , Q@@ asi@@ m Ak@@ ram from Bol@@ ton , Greater Manchester , was the father of four children who was on his first pilgrimage to support the crane .
Mr Ak@@ ram was with his parents before the beginning of the annual H@@ add@@ ling in the Great Mos@@ que .
Saudi officials have already stated that the H@@ add@@ an will continue to Mec@@ ca with thousands who will continue to come to the city .
today King Sal@@ man said the bin Laden group should not have been allowed to steal the arm of the crane when it was not used .
an Arab version of the decree published by the state Saudi Press Agency said that the Bin Laden Group was responsible for the collapse .
the news agency &apos;s English @-@ language service did not report this detail , but said that the management of the company was forbidden abroad .
at the beginning of this week , Sal@@ man promised to reveal what caused the fall of the crane , which fell into an inner courtyard of the Grand Mo@@ sch@@ ee , where hundreds of thousands of Muslims were gathered in front of the H@@ add@@ an who later took place this month .
the Bin Laden Group has issued no statements about the collapse of the crane , and its representatives were not available for a statement .
the Royal Dec@@ ree also rebu@@ ked the group because of not current security measures and because they did not cooperate with meteor@@ ologists .
dozens of cranes surround Mek@@ ka &apos;s Groß@@ mo@@ sch@@ ee as part of the massive building project managed by the bin Laden group .
the Bin Laden family has been associated with the Saudi family of Saudi Arabia for decades and takes over bigger construction projects .
the dec@@ eased leader of Al Qaeda , Os@@ ama bin Laden , was a non @-@ violent son who was ex@@ propri@@ ated by the family in the 1990 &quot; s .
the crash of the crane came in the midst of strong winds and rain , only a few days before the arrival of millions in the kingdom for the pilgrimage , which is required at least once in the life of each healthy Muslims .
officials said that 158 people remain in the hospital .
government officials stated that 1 million Ri@@ al ( £ 17@@ 4.000 ) should be paid to the relatives of the killed and the same amount of permanently wounded .
other wounded get half of this amount .
B &amp; Q Bos@@ s says that the time of cheap Eastern European tra@@ des@@ men is over
British employ arti@@ sans more and more , says Ver@@ oni@@ que Lau@@ ry
the number of qualified craftsmen from Eastern Europe has increased
this means that 200 other Scre@@ w@@ fix stores target@@ ing professional tra@@ des@@ people are opened .
at the same time , King@@ fis@@ her will close 60 B &amp; Q outlets nationwide
by Ru@@ pert St@@ einer , City Chef correspon@@ dent of the Daily Mail
it is alleged that Br@@ its put down their h@@ amm@@ ers and brushes in favor of the use of qualified Eastern European arti@@ sans that carry out work in their homes .
if you can use a hammer or a brush to paint walls , you seem to belong to a minority today .
for the British increasingly employ arti@@ sans in order to carry out DIY jobs in their houses , so the boss of the company behind B &amp; Q .
V@@ é@@ ron@@ ique Lau@@ ry , new Managing Director of King@@ fis@@ her , who owns the DIY chain , said that a large increase in the number of qualified professional tra@@ des@@ men from Eastern Europe offer services at low prices are now over@@ hau@@ led .
therefore , King@@ fis@@ her plans to open 200 other Scre@@ w@@ fix stores that are aimed at tra@@ des@@ people and close 60 sales points from B &amp; Q .
Mr@@ s Lau@@ ry said she wants to employ more women in B &amp; Q shops , because eight of ten purchase decisions are made by women .
at the moment , men predomin@@ ate .
she said it was necessary to face the growing demographic trends that have more female single households performing more renov@@ ations than in the past .
Mr@@ s Lau@@ ry said : &quot; it still works a majority of men in our branches .
we have to shift this more strongly towards a balance .
basically , half of our clients consist of women with 80 percent of decisions on purchasing articles by women .
women play a major role in the decision @-@ making process .
Mr@@ s Lau@@ ry , who is one of only five women listed at the top of a British in the FT@@ SE@@ 100 index , has also re@@ structured her top team to reflect an equal number of men and women in executive positions .
king@@ fis@@ her is almost the only company that occupies exactly 50 percent of the team with women , including its management and Chief Financial Officer .
Mr@@ s Lau@@ ry said : &quot; this was a conscious decision - diversity is an important issue here .
it was not difficult to find good women for our Supervisory Board .
the King@@ Fis@@ her reported a decline in the half @-@ year profit and sales after the group was responsible for closing the stores .
because of the trends , King@@ fis@@ her , who owns Scre@@ w@@ fix and B &amp; Q , will open 200 new branches .
officials of A@@ ich / D@@ ob due to in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity before court
on Wednesday , two function@@ aries of the Austrian volleyball champion A@@ ich / D@@ ob have to be responsible for in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity and abor@@ tion .
the def@@ end@@ ants were not guilty .
one of them had also been accused of abuse .
he has been acqu@@ itted of this accus@@ ation in May .
the current process was postpon@@ ed .
according to the At@@ tor@@ ney General , Robert Ri@@ ffel had cryst@@ alli@@ sed in the preliminary investigation that the def@@ end@@ ants used money from club accounts in the years 2006 to 2011 , about which they were allowed to disp@@ ose in their functions , for private purposes .
he will deal with some 400@@ ,000 Euros for the damage .
the sports officials are also charged with financial problems .
this fact gave rise to the chair@@ woman of the Sho@@ v@@ eller , judge Micha@@ ela San@@ in .
it shall be negotiated at a later date .
in order to blame the in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity , the defence argued that at no time an asset was created .
the sports officials only comp@@ eted expenses and the sports club for which they had been operating from 1982 to 2011 , and in which they invested a lot of time and money out of the debt - the Pas@@ si@@ va sold around 600@@ ,000 Sch@@ ill@@ ings in 2001 ( approx . 4@@ 4.000 Euro ) .
&quot; back then we stood in front of the situation : do we keep the club further or do we stop ? &quot; said one of the def@@ end@@ ants , in the bread profession of the audi@@ tor of the financial office .
with his colleague and co @-@ accused , he then decided to take over this task .
with all risks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have poured money , our life insurance policies as security for the bank , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said during the arrest . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the association has been agreed : you can freely admini@@ ster the money , it is not allowed to pay any debts .
in case of a corresponding financial success , the payment of the allowance for expenses had been resolved retro@@ actively until 1991 .
for this reason , one part of the reimbur@@ sement of expenses was paid for years later , namely from 2003 , when a plus had been on the account .
therefore , l@@ ump sum and not detailed bookings appeared , the former chairman explained the proceedings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the accounts and books managed to manage the two def@@ end@@ ants together , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the second accused . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why the pay@@ outs were not disclosed in detail to the association , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the judge . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the association did not care in detail for the financial reinforcement , it was important to have only the freedom of debt , so the answer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
when in 2011 against the one functional investigation started for office abuse , an amount of 120@@ ,000 euros was transferred to the club account .
these were appropri@@ ations , the def@@ end@@ ants declared .
this securities account ran on the name of the second accused and was not known according to the association &apos;s statement .
&quot; why ? &quot; the judge wanted to know .
the respon@@ dent did not know for a long time .
then he finally thought that this was the best thing for the club .
if something had happened to him , no one would have known anything about that money , the prosec@@ utor put it into the room .
the accused was informed , justified the function@@ ary .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this transfer was formulated as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; damage compensation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
why compensation ? , judge and prosec@@ utor wanted to know .
the first def@@ end@@ ant stated that he did not agree with this formulation because the association had never been damaged .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but what should I do if the lawyer says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with this you are all from the tailor . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; am I a legal representative ? &quot; he asked .
furthermore , the function@@ ary , he never paid a c@@ ents salary , he just paid mil@@ eage and di@@ ets .
he charged 1,000 euros per month to di@@ ets , but the actual expenditure was much higher , he added .
the def@@ end@@ ants were unable to present precise documents for the early years .
these were no longer kept , according to an audit , in which everything had been judged correctly , they declared .
the second accused took o@@ dom@@ eter money .
in his statement , he stated in his statement that he had to leave the international market to the bank to Blei@@ burg from his place of residence .
the main hearing is continued on 23 September with the interview of witnesses .
Hewlett @-@ Packard presents another 30,000 jobs
in addition to personnel reduction for three years , the Compu@@ terri@@ ese will continue to disman@@ tle further jobs in the company &apos;s spl@@ itting up .
the positions of the Hewlett @-@ Packard ( HP ) computer do not have an end .
as part of its restructuring , the US technology group plans to reduce the reduction of 25,000 to 30,000 jobs in its corporate customer segment .
as a result , costs in the amount of EUR 2.7 billion are to be saved ( 2.4 billion euros ) , the company announced on Tuesday .
the step will lead to a special load of around 2.7 billion dollars , which will be incurred from the fourth quarter .
the disman@@ tling of 55@@ ,000 jobs , which has been running for three years , has not yet been completed .
at the end of the fiscal year 2013 / 14 , HP employed some 30@@ 2,000 associates at the end of the fiscal year 2013 / 14 .
the Hewlett @-@ Packard @-@ Share gave a 2.3 percent after@@ market share .
the large group of printers from California Pal@@ o Alto is currently spl@@ itting up : the computer and printer business is to be bund@@ led in a new company , separated from the more promising areas with computer servers and data storage for companies and other services .
both business units are to be listed on the stock exchange .

the 76 @-@ year @-@ old company under the leadership of Me@@ g Whit@@ man has recently re@@ acted to the fact that customers increasingly purchase smartphones and tablets instead of traditional computers and do more business online .
in total , Whit@@ man &apos;s restructuring plans envis@@ age the reduction of around 55@@ ,000 jobs .

24 percent are opposed to interven@@ ing in the conflict .
a collaboration with Syrian rulers Bas@@ har al @-@ Assad declined 51 percent of those surv@@ eyed , 20 percent would be .

R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke : violent breach of Serbian @-@ Hungarian border
the Hungarian police put in the Ser@@ b border near R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke Tr@@ än@@ eng@@ as and Wasser@@ ej@@ ector against several hundred refugees .
Eur@@ on@@ ews correspon@@ dent D@@ á@@ ni@@ el Bo@@ z@@ si@@ k has witnessed the breach of violence at the border control point .
he reported by telephone :
a group of refugees broke the border .
behind it was a police line formed and behind the polic@@ emen there was a water lamp ready .
40 to 50 refugees started throwing stones , sticks and plastic bottles to the officials .
the officials initially set un@@ interrup@@ t@@ edly pepper spray .
after that the police used tear gas .
a lot of tear gas was spra@@ yed towards the refugees .
the group was thus dissolved .
the refugees have now withdrawn a little bit .
a pregnant and apparently injured woman was removed from the zone .
children who inhal@@ ed the tear gas cried out .
other refugees collap@@ sed and suffered from short@@ ness of breath .
the press spokes@@ men of the Serbian police also suffered injuries by the use of tear gas and pepper spray .
time of decision on interest rates for the US central bank
the world ob@@ serves when the U.S. bank is coming together on two days , Wednesday and Thursday to make the most important decision whether for the first time since almost a decade the interest is raised or not .
a survey among 80 econom@@ ists surv@@ eyed by Reu@@ ters found out that a little more than half the last week of view was that the F@@ ed will do this , now think that the F@@ ed will remain a little longer and the interest rates at the current level will be from 0 to 0.@@ 25 percent .
it is a historical event because it has been seven years since F@@ ed Inter@@ est bet on NU@@ LL .
&quot; for the first time , we approach a situation in which a large central bank may leave the zero area and start a process of normal@@ ising interest rates , &quot; said Angel U@@ bid , Chief of Staff at the Peter@@ son Institute for International Economics .
the U.S. economy is on a relatively good level of power , tri@@ l@@ lion dollars are added to the balance sheet and generate only a low inflation .
however , the F@@ ed cannot ignore the less raw outlook on global conditions .
it has warned the markets to adjust to an increase , but the signs point out that the odds against such a step are good .
the decision is to be announced at 20.00 o &apos;clock CE@@ T on Thursday
death Prot@@ ector at Delta State University left sorry
after the shooting and killing of his girlfriend in Miss@@ issi@@ ppi on Monday morning - and before he later shot his colleague and killed - Sh@@ ann@@ on Lamb wrote a note to say that he was &quot; sorry &quot; in the first murder and wanted , &quot; he could not make it happen , &quot; authorities announced on Tuesday .
the police in Gau@@ tier , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , said that Lamb , professor of ge@@ ography and social science education at the Delta State University , called the emergency number at 10 : 00 on Monday morning
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; He shot on someone and killed someone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
lamb told the staff of the emergency call center that the police had to send police officers to his home .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I shot my wife yesterday evening &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and he also mentioned that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sweet dog &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is in the house , but &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nobody will distur@@ b , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but probably will be excited . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the police asked the c@@ aller according to his name , but he did not give him .
lamb did not give any explanation for his shots .
when police entered the scene , they found the body of A@@ my Pr@@ enti@@ ss , 41 , and a hand@@ written notice from Lamb , 45 who said : &quot; I am sorry I wanted , I could und@@ o it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I loved A@@ my , and she is the only woman ever loved me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after writing the note , Lamb slain 300 miles to Delta State University , where he killed E@@ than Schmidt , a professor of history , before finally killed his own life on Monday evening when polic@@ emen were surrounded .
the university president William La@@ For@@ ge said he didn &apos;t know anything about a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt , but &quot; of course there was something in Mr Lam@@ bs &apos;s performance . &quot;
despite reports on Monday that Lamb believed that Pr@@ é@@ ss had also had a relationship with Schmidt , authorities said on Tuesday that there is &quot; no information , no evidence &quot; for a &quot; tri@@ angular relationship . &quot;
Pr@@ enti@@ ss was told by Sha@@ wn O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en who said that they were married for about seven years , as a &quot; good man . &quot;
the two were divor@@ ced 15 years ago , but they remained friends .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said he and Pr@@ enti@@ ss would have a daughter who is 19 , and she was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; destroyed on the ground . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said that Pr@@ enti@@ ss was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; absolutely best friends &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Pr@@ enti@@ ss worked online from home , according to L@@ ins@@ day Know@@ les , who was identified by Sun Her@@ ald as a close friend of Pr@@ enti@@ ss .
Know@@ les said that Pr@@ enti@@ ss , who owned a dog named Light@@ ning , met with Lamb for about three years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she always wanted to help other people , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Know@@ les . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the police said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Lamb had called relatives at a certain time on Monday to tell them , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he does not go to jail . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
when polic@@ emen picked him on Highway 1 near Green@@ ville that night , Lamb drove his car to the side , fled to foot , ran into the forest and killed himself with a shot .
in the spring of 2015 , Lamb received a doc@@ torate from the Delta State University as his curriculum at the University &apos;s website .

Eu@@ row@@ ings : Lufthansa builds the Group around
Lufthansa is planning a large group conversion .
the Lufthansa Group wants to save half a billion euros a year alone with a better organization .
150 of the approximately 1000 executives around the world will cost the Group conversion to the workplace .
with the pilot union , however , there are new negotiations .
the Lufthansa builds its corporate structure and evalu@@ ates the cheap ud@@ ders .
the target of the real@@ ignment is a contribution to earnings of some 500 million euros a year from cost and revenue syner@@ gies , the airline shared with it on Wednesday .
among other things , Lufthansa will have no more board for the passenger business in the future .
the squ@@ ir@@ t line Eu@@ row@@ ings should be developed as independent as possible .
in the management team headed by Car@@ sten Sp@@ oh@@ r , Karl Ulrich Gar@@ n@@ adt will be responsible for Eu@@ row@@ ings in the future .
with the real@@ ignment , Sp@@ oh@@ r emphas@@ ises the importance of Eu@@ row@@ ings , with which the Group wants to compete against Ry@@ an@@ air and Easy@@ jet in the future .
until now , the organization of the 120 000 employees has been complex .
the airlines operated under the roof of the Passage Air@@ line Group , which places three quarters of the annual turnover of 30 billion euros .
new negotiations with the pilots
in the conflict of tari@@ ff with the cockpit of the cockpit ( VC ) , negotiations will be resum@@ ed on this Thursday after the first strike .
this shared the union with them .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the theme of talks should be the retirement provision for pilots . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a year with a predicted record result , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; cockpit &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; will come as quickly as possible to sustainable results . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the conflict between the union and airline led to various strikes in recent months .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition to the transitional provision of the pilots the background is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wings &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is fores@@ eeable that in the fight against competitors , Lufthansa is en@@ lag@@ ging on the Group &apos;s own cheap line Eu@@ row@@ ings .

Luke Sha@@ w from Manchester United can &apos;t play for months due to double frac@@ ture
Luke Sha@@ w received a double frac@@ ture of his right leg at the Manchester &apos;s Champions League defeat at PS@@ V Ein@@ d@@ hoven .
while this brought the left outside defender to the wine and shut him out for at least six months from playing , Louis van Ga@@ al does not give up hope that Sha@@ w can play again in this season .
the injury was caused by a ru@@ th@@ less attack by H@@ é@@ c@@ tor Mor@@ eno in the 15th minute after the 20 year old Sha@@ w had collap@@ sed into the PS@@ V area .
he was treated for nine minutes on the playground and needed oxygen before he was taken to hospital .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; van Ga@@ al said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he has a double leg score and is in the hospital . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he will be reloc@@ ated tomorrow or maybe a day later and then operated in Manchester .
it &apos;s horri@@ ble - a boy who comes with 18 to Manchester United , it has very hard and then fantastic to play , and then that happens .
in the locker room he had an oxygen mask .
he cried .
I &apos;m not a doctor , but if you have a double frac@@ ture , then it takes six months and it will not play in the group phase .
I hope he can play this season again .
Mor@@ eno seemed happy to be able to escape a red card and the suspension of an El@@ f@@ meter .
Nic@@ ola Ri@@ zz@@ oli , the refer@@ ee , did not punish the Mexican .
van Ga@@ al assumed the Italian arbit@@ er had er@@ red .
you can judge for yourself if I say that an El@@ f@@ meter and a red card were due .
it was a very serious attack with both legs .
a tweet to Sha@@ w &apos;s account was : &quot; thank you all for your messages . words cannot describe how broken I am , my way to recovery starts now , I come back more strongly . &quot;
related to this : Manchester United suffers the loss of Luke Sha@@ w in defeat at PS@@ V
with the European Championship in France , the United Kingdom def@@ enders had an additional incentive to recover until the next June .
Phil@@ lip Coc@@ u , the PS@@ V @-@ Trainer , said : &quot; it &apos;s a very bad injury . &quot;
when a player with this kind of injury leaves the place , all are very sad about it .
it is never the intention of our players to hurt an opponent .
Mor@@ eno suffered a leg break when Mexico played against Van Ga@@ al Holland team at the World Cup in 2014 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is very difficult because it wasn &apos;t his intention to hurt the opponent , and if you hear it &apos;s a very bad injury , that &apos;s not good , &quot; said Coc@@ u .
for me it was not possible to see the moment .
the only thing I could see was the ball moving in a different direction , so it looked like he had touched him , but I could not see the attack on Luke .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in conversation with S@@ BS@@ 6 , Mor@@ eno said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I know how it feels , I know how difficult it can be . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I feel very bad about it . I &apos;m so sorry .
the PS@@ V player Andr@@ és Gu@@ ard@@ ado was also brought to hospital - after a f@@ oul@@ der by Chris Sm@@ alling .
surely David Cameron knows better The Lor@@ ax ?
it is a matter that all parents will soon learn : if your child loves a book , it will not take long before you know it almost .
unless you are David Cameron .
when he was asked by a provider of child@@ care systems to call his favorite children &apos;s book , the Prime Minister for The Lor@@ ax , the environmental be@@ ak published in 1971 , decided by Dr Se@@ uss .
it was a difficult choice , writes Cameron in a message on Super@@ Camp@@ s website , and continues : &quot; funny , moving , creative and with a powerful message , it &apos;s a book that I like to read my children , as it always seems to be a picture or message that we have missed so far . &quot;
everything nice and good , except that the following paragraph describing Cameron is supposed to describe the story of the book instead of re @-@ giving a content of the 2012 movie version that added new characters and details to extend the rather short original text .
&quot; amid the walled city of Th@@ ought @-@ Ville , where all nature is gone and even the air is a commodity , a boy named T@@ ed hopes to win the heart of Au@@ dre@@ y , the girl of his dreams , &quot; reads . a love interest was Dr. Se@@ uss , whose real name was The@@ odor Se@@ uss Gei@@ sel and who died in 1991 , however completely unknown .
as if this would not be suspi@@ cious enough : the text presented by Cameron is partly read like the summary of the Lor@@ ax movie , which is presented on the website of the Internet Movie Database and thus begins : &quot; in the walled city of Th@@ ought @-@ Ville , where everything is arti@@ fici@@ ally and even the air is a commodity , a boy named T@@ ed , the heart of Au@@ dre@@ y , hopes to win the girl of his dreams . &quot;
although he ad@@ mits to be a pra@@ g@@ matic father , it seems unlikely that Cameron is so familiar with the story of the book . here , an un@@ named boy , like the local environment , hears thri@@ ving , thri@@ ving , thri@@ cking On@@ ce @-@ ler in spite of the protests of the name of the name of the name of the name of the trees , &quot; rav@@ aged by the name of the trees . &quot;
most likely , such a relatively low PR task was deleg@@ ated to a hel@@ per who did not read The Lor@@ ax 20 times consec@@ u@@ tively to a child .
a Dow@@ ning @-@ Street spokesperson said that the text was probably from Cameron &apos;s election bul@@ letin .
Super@@ Camp@@ s confirmed that the text was delivered by Cameron &apos;s staff , but there were no more direct comments .
Adam Ly@@ th was clearly threatened by the expul@@ sion from England &apos;s crew , but it is still difficult
hitting Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates is a difficult task , but if you see the cad@@ re that England has chosen for the tour , a repeat of the 3 @-@ 0 test series defeat is not on my card .
I would not exclude a downward trend .
A@@ last@@ air C@@ ooks page may be less experienced than those three years ago , but there are good spin players in the bat@@ ting list , and the community spirit is strong ; they will not wear sc@@ ars of 2012 , only a you@@ thful positive attitude .
with the ball Mo@@ een Ali is developing as a spin @-@ bow@@ ler and Adi@@ l Ras@@ hid , even if he represents an unknown size at the test level , is an option for the attack .
related news : Adam Ly@@ th fails from the UK test cad@@ re and is replaced by Alex H@@ ales .
the decision to release Adam Ly@@ th is of course for me as his head coach in Yor@@ k@@ shire , difficult to analyze .
with its seven tests , there were two good attacks under difficult conditions , and the simple but hard reality is that cri@@ cket players are focused on results .
there were no question marks with Joe R@@ oot , for example , and that led to the nom@@ ination , there - and I said that - players are their own best selection .
long ago we would have extended the course of Ly@@ th , but he had control of his own fate .
if he hopefully kno@@ cks out further shopping for Yor@@ k@@ shire , another chance comes .
the England @-@ Trainer Tre@@ vor Bay@@ li@@ ss praised his attitude even if he did not get such good performances , and that doesn &apos;t surprise me ; he is above all a team @-@ man .
the question of how much time a test person receives to put his character is difficult .
Ly@@ th got seven chances - like Sam Rob@@ son before him - while Nick Comp@@ ton got nine .
only Comp@@ ton got the chance to play home and forward .
the only accus@@ ation that one can raise was that England first used Jonathan Des@@ p@@ ite in the Caribbean - when Ly@@ th was in top form - but this lost chance is now in the past .
Alex H@@ ales is coming in , and he is a hammer I highly in@@ timi@@ date .
he is an X @-@ factor cri@@ cket player , which we saw in Yor@@ k@@ shire early in this season when he scored 2@@ 36 against us on a Tr@@ ent Bridge , which met us very much .
he must have at least the same opportunities as those before him , but this depends on the team order in the United Arab Emirates .
the idea of hitting Mo@@ een next to Cook , which would provide an extra spin Bow@@ ler and get four Qui@@ cks , appeared , and I have nothing against it .
I don &apos;t see why a hammer can &apos;t beat there , and this left @-@ h@@ ander has already shown that he is a vi@@ cious circle of cri@@ cket players .
mos@@ ques may not have done his job for his County Wor@@ c@@ ester@@ shire , but he &apos;s a number 3 for them , and there is no big difference .
my former team @-@ mate Jus@@ tin Lan@@ ger played his first 38 tests at the first drop before he appeared as an op@@ ener in 2001 .
he immediately made three hundred of us and did not look back .
Z@@ afar Ans@@ ari comes in the cad@@ res as back @-@ up sp@@ inner , and in my limited handling with him he has impressed me as a young man .
people may see his statistics - average 31 with the bat and 35 with the ball - and think it &apos;s a pun@@ t , but there is no large number of backup sp@@ inners that raise their hands and the trainers have opted for youth .
he will learn a lot on this tour .
apart from the team , England has made some smart additions to the train@@ ee .
the appointment of Mah@@ ela J@@ ay@@ awar@@ dene , the B@@ ats@@ man from Sri Lanka , as a consultant for the test games could be a master coup .
he is one of the nic@@ est guys in the game , who will bring a wealth of experience , since he has played under all conditions and against all attacks .
Paul Coll@@ ing@@ wood comes to the white ball stage of the tour and brings energy and a powerful commitment to the setup .
I always felt he was created for the International Cri@@ cket contest as a player or coach , and like Mah@@ ela he has insights from which we can benefit .
sometimes new voices in the locker room can bring fresh air , even if the messages are in line with the previous one .
Coll@@ ys team @-@ mate at Dur@@ ham , Ben St@@ okes , is not used in the One Day@@ ers , R@@ oot got a similar break against Australia and I have no problem with it for my part .
some will not agree , but coaches and team players do not determine the schedule .
and you must remember that , as with the players , their jobs depend on the results .
such decisions are not taken lightly .
the Bre@@ x@@ it camp ( Bre@@ x@@ it = exit from Britain from the EU ) could gain access to Zul@@ u if the economy reaches a sl@@ ur@@ ry until 2017
David Cameron &apos;s un@@ wi@@ ped ren@@ eg@@ oti@@ ation strategy to keep Britain in the EU is getting deeper every day even without the election of the brilliant Jerem@@ y &quot; Is it Yes or No ? &quot; Cor@@ by@@ n to the leader of Labour or the TU@@ C , which is fierce because of Europe on Tuesday .
foreigners also have their Cor@@ by@@ ns and Ni@@ gel Far@@ ages .
a European diplom@@ ati@@ al said recently that some member states , as deeply involved in various crises , as the EU is now , and not always on their own fault , Britain &apos;s self @-@ created agenda with split conc@@ essions and disrup@@ tive treaty changes that they usually do not want to be full .
in Bri@@ gh@@ ton , the TU@@ C decided on its annual meeting that it does not like it if it je@@ op@@ ardi@@ zes social protection .
we could also call it Dave and Georges Sel@@ f@@ ie &apos;s agenda .
Prime Minister and Finance ministers climb to summit or bilateral meetings in foreign capitals , make a photo of themselves in front of a famous local monument , with or without local sizes , come home and say that they win allies for reforms .
it &apos;s always about me .
my European boy@@ friend , looking forward to outside the EU tent - &quot; Let &apos;s not alone with France , &quot; says Berlin - and lets you see that more and more short @-@ si@@ ghted ministers and officials have come to the point where it doesn &apos;t matter whether we stay or go .
Germany &apos;s cau@@ tious chan@@ cell@@ or Angela Merkel is an ally , but she has been in power for 10 years and wants to leave the office before it looks bad for her as it happened in the exc@@ essively long endurance such as T@@ hat@@ cher ( 11 years ) , Mit@@ ter@@ rand ( 14 ) and K@@ ohl ( 16 ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; France &apos;s François Hollande can look back on his re @-@ election or replacement in 2017 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he is also a f@@ ading force .
Poland may soon have a nation@@ alist right government , Spain a left one .
it is hard to imagine that they will get a leg to help the Sel@@ f@@ ie British whose energy should be better used to prevent Scotland &apos;s withdrawal from the UK - something they don &apos;t want , because most similar separ@@ ati@@ st tendencies have .
therefore , some such ministers may even intentionally not plan helpful comments , entirely in SN@@ P style , while Britain &apos;s referendum campaign 2017 to speed up the Bre@@ x@@ it process susp@@ ects my friend .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the ren@@ eg@@ oti@@ ation was a bank@@ rupt@@ cy &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Great Britain has won no value from the ren@@ eg@@ oti@@ ation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Europeans know how pre@@ dat@@ ory Fle@@ et Street can be at their expense and what EU scep@@ tics are the oli@@ gar@@ chy of the press @-@ ons as they did during the 1975 referendum inspired by Tony Ben@@ n , which supported our entry in 1973 with a ratio of 2 : 1 .
they can easily remember Boris Johnson , the Er@@ z @-@ Euro opport@@ uni@@ sts who made a name as a &quot; EU @-@ Ger@@ ade ban@@ anas &quot; Brussels correspon@@ dent in the early 90 &quot; s .
with all his ma@@ dness , Ed Mili@@ band knew who his enemies were .
this included the Med@@ ley of tax @-@ fear@@ ing vil@@ la@@ ins , phone @-@ h@@ ack@@ ening ali@@ ens and the pseu@@ do @-@ non @-@ countries that possess most of our large newspapers .
actually Tony Bla@@ ir thought about her , but realized that when you sit with a hot gor@@ illa in a cage , you are better distributed ban@@ anas to distra@@ ct him instead of going for lunch and dinner .
in fact , Mili@@ band was more Bla@@ ir than Bla@@ ir himself when he resist@@ ed Cameron &apos;s referendum , because Bla@@ ir had put the principle of the un@@ approved constitution of the EU , which was then rejected by French and Dutch voters in 2005 , which opened him a backdoor .
the press has never forgiven him either .
but the nice Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ n , who gave me a friendly rap@@ es@@ eed on Monday in Westminster - I told him that he didn &apos;t need time for me - seems in danger of repe@@ ating N@@ eil Kin@@ no@@ cks boy@@ cot@@ t Mur@@ doch &apos;s strategy of the 80 &quot; s , an error back then and today .
it may take , but he must develop a coherent strategy to win the media , not with me , but certainly with Andrew Mar@@ r , whose BBC @-@ sofa he left on Sunday .
Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s official position in Europe is - I think it &apos;s kind - in development .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says we should stay in a re@@ formed EU . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
well , most people outside of U@@ ki@@ ps &apos;s traditional blo@@ b @-@ off tendency and the wild gra@@ dient of Tor@@ ey &apos;s Klein @-@ Engli@@ sh@@ ism can say yes .
it is what Hil@@ ary &quot; A Ben@@ n , but no B@@ enn@@ ie &quot; Ben@@ n on the radio and television this week said when the boy sc@@ outs fought in him , not admit that Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s appointment of the provo@@ king John Mc@@ Don@@ n@@ ell was a bad idea .
it reminded me of the 70 &quot; s when his old father tried television to be il@@ loyal to his Labour Cab@@ inet , without going too far and losing his cabinet job .
Hil@@ ar@@ ys &apos;s struggle was even more attractive .
but to fight to &quot; remain under all circumstances &quot; - B@@ enn@@ s expression - was not what Mc@@ Don@@ n@@ ell said , nor what J@@ C told his comrades and de@@ pu@@ ties after all reports on their cl@@ auses on Monday evening .
whatever the original bottom @-@ up image of Cor@@ by@@ n wants to convey - remember that he even touched me - News discipline remains important in the era of TV round the clock and above all in the whirlpool of social media , a breeding site of par@@ ano@@ ia and betra@@ yal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is right to give Cameron a free ticket for Europe which allows him to maintain Lab@@ ours support in the referendum campaign for a matter of course , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mc@@ Don@@ n@@ ell said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Simon J@@ enk@@ ins certainly thinks like that .
but Mc@@ Don@@ n@@ ell and Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s fundamental ambig@@ u@@ ities for EU membership - in accordance with its B@@ enn@@ ite siege economy , its anti @-@ capitalist past - is no longer just a question of es@@ ot@@ eric discussion among left dissi@@ dents , for which the nar@@ c@@ iss@@ ism of the small difference is a central principle of dog@@ matic disputes .
as with his ambig@@ u@@ ities for Nato - Tom Wat@@ son is sure that J@@ C does not start a campaign to leave - foreign diplom@@ ats will be obliged to try to find a sense of their superi@@ ors at home .
why should Paris or Berlin waste political capital - they also have suspi@@ cious voters - to make conc@@ essions to the British when all this can be meaning@@ less ?
the US is already quite disappointed with the weak military power in Iraq , Libya and Syria , even with a cost reduction of the T@@ ory government in power , which I was reminded on Monday by something that was called British In@@ flu@@ ence Security Forum .
experts critic@@ ise Public Health Report on E @-@ cigar@@ ettes
claims of a state @-@ financed agency that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are less harmful than smoking originated from a meeting of 12 people , some with connections to the tobacco industry , researchers said .
experts who write in the British Medical Journal ( BM@@ J ) joined L@@ anc@@ et by critic@@ ising the evidence used by Public Health England ( P@@ he ) in her report on e @-@ cigar@@ ettes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he published the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; basic report &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; last month and describes it as a &quot; comprehensive review of the evidence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , some researchers have questioned the resili@@ ence of the data and pointed to the connections between some experts and the tobacco industry .
an editorial in the medical journal L@@ anc@@ et last month attacked the &quot; extra@@ ordinarily win@@ dy foundation &quot; on which P@@ he founded his most important conclusion .
two more researchers write in BM@@ J and asked whether the claims &quot; build on stone or sand . &quot;
Martin Mc@@ K@@ ee , Professor of European Public Health at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine and Simon Cap@@ e@@ well , Professor of Clinical Epide@@ mi@@ ology at the University of Liverpool , said : &quot; a basic principle of public health is that strategies should be based on proof of efficacy . &quot;
they said that the public expects that the alleg@@ ation of P@@ it that &quot; the present best estimate is that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are about 95 % less harmful than smoking &quot; based on a detailed review of evidence and modelling .
in fact , this statement comes from a single session of 12 people who were conven@@ ed to develop a model for multi @-@ criteria Decision Analysis ( MC@@ DA ) in order to lead their opinions on the damages caused by different ni@@ cot@@ ine @-@ containing products to a synthesis ; the results of the meeting were summar@@ ised in a research report .
Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well said that a sponsor of the meeting was a company called Euro@@ Swiss Health , whose managing director had previously been awarded by British American Tob@@ acco Resource ( BA@@ T ) for an independent study .
he also signed BA@@ T references to public health in a sustainability report , they said .
one of the 12 participants at the meeting explained how to get funds from an E @-@ cigarette manufacturer , but not the funding he has received after reports from the tobacco company Philip Mor@@ ris International , added them .
the reasons for the selection of the members of the committee are not delivered , but there are several well @-@ known e @-@ cigar@@ ettes champi@@ ons , some of which also include a sector financing in the paper .
some other participants at this meeting are not known for their know @-@ how in tobacco control .
at the meeting also the tobacco management of P@@ he took part .
the Group &apos;s research work says that there is a lack of &quot; hard evidence for most of the products &quot; damage to most criteria , &quot; wrote Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well .
however , none of these links or limitations will be discussed in the P@@ he report .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well said that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is no evidence that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there has been no evidence that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes were used as a way to smoke for children or non @-@ smo@@ kers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Pro@@ f Kevin F@@ enton , Director of Health and Well @-@ being at P@@ he said that he has already re@@ acted to the alleg@@ ations of BM@@ J .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; electric cigar@@ ettes are essentially less harmful than smoking . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
every second lifel@@ ong smo@@ ker dies at his ad@@ diction .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all evidence suggests that the health risks of e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are small compared to that , but that we continue to study the long @-@ term impact . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
P@@ he has the clear duty of inform@@ ing the public about what evidence shows and what not , especially if there is so much public confusion about the relative dangers compared to tobacco .
almost 8@@ 0,000 people die every year on a disease related to smoking , and smoking costs the National Health System two billion pounds per year .
through the clear presentation of current evidence that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are not without risk , but only a fraction of the damage caused by smoking , we comply with our national jurisdiction .
BBC should give up East@@ er@@ date , says former head of Channel 4
the former chairman of Channel 4 , Luke Johnson , said that the BBC should stop sending programs like East@@ er@@ enders and The Voice . he said that commercial ri@@ vals would give their right arm &quot; for hit shows like the Albert Square So@@ ap .
Johnson said that the broadcast fee should only be used to make the kind of programs that are not broadcast by other UK transm@@ it@@ ters .
he critic@@ ised the BBC for making public @-@ law programmes , which are likely to be seen by a smaller audience , to place in hard controversial time windows against the most popular shows of their ri@@ vals and from transm@@ it@@ ters such as BB@@ C4 .
after the BBC &apos;s CEO , Tony Hall , said that the company wanted to do more in partnership with other organizations , Johnson said that he tried to get in touch with the BBC for six years in his time at Channel 4 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have problems with the idea that BBC programs are commissioned or sent , which would also clearly be shown by non @-@ subsidi@@ zed ri@@ vals , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Johnson to the Chief of the Communication Committee as part of his investigation on the future of BBC . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if you would like to keep the broadcast fee , which I do not hold for a good idea in the medium or long term , you should at least invest in your production on programs that others do not do or commission .
they send The Voice in a first @-@ class time window because they want to achieve as broad support for their future .
the idea that otherwise nobody would show it is a joke , it &apos;s ridi@@ culous , it &apos;s of course non@@ sense .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Johnson said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t see why a reg@@ res@@ sive tax funding could be financed without subsidies . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Voice is such a program , East@@ ering is another , ad@@ mitt@@ edly both own productions .
to be honest , other channels would give their right arm .
I must see how this is meant to be public television .
I don &apos;t think this would reduce the BBC at all .
Johnson , an entrepren@@ eur for series , who led Channel 4 from 2004 to 2010 said that the BBC is to blame for reviews &quot; because of the ambi@@ tions of people working there , and because they believe this is the best way to secure long @-@ term support . &quot;
his comments on BBC &apos;s most popular broad@@ casts are what the former head of Sky , Tony Ball , suggested in his Mac@@ Tag@@ gart presentation in Edinburgh in 2003 that the BBC shows how East@@ er@@ enders should sell .
Johnson said that the more public @-@ legal niche programs should go to BB@@ C4 , where you can &apos;t measure the audience , but they perform their tasks , and they can argue if they go to their apparent missions for justi@@ fying 4 billion £ broadcast charges , &quot; Well , of course , we have created all these obsc@@ ure programs that no one has ever seen . &quot;
they put them in a time window in which no one ever wanted to see them .
Johnson said to the Committee on the broadcast fee : &quot; I urge you to find a more reg@@ res@@ sive system in terms of conditions , who can get the best value here .
of course , all of us think that one gets a great value for £ 150 a year , but for people who are a lot of money for the £ 150 per year , I wonder if this is true , because they don &apos;t consume much of the BBC .
former Sky@@ - and Channel 5 boss David El@@ stein , who also testified before the committee on Tuesday , demanded that the BBC should check their ethics mission to &quot; inform , train and maintain . &quot;
he said that only little of the BBC production would now be officially classified as education - he said that it was 1 % of their TV production and 0.1 % on the radio - and they should take an example of this in &quot; inform@@ ing , educ@@ ating and talking about the public broad@@ ca@@ ster television broad@@ casts in Australia and Canada . &quot;
to the question of partnerships , El@@ stein said that the BBC should do more in areas like the pro@@ ms , of which he said that only a handful of television are shown , and with the commercial Sen@@ ders Alli@@ ances to make everything available online .
&apos;@@ Son@@ o@@ genetic &apos; can control brain cells by sound waves
the video shows how the n@@ em@@ ato@@ des change the direction in the moment they are be@@ amed with sound impulses .
scientists have bred worms with genetically modified nerve systems , which can be controlled by break@@ outs of sound waves .
the tiny n@@ em@@ ato@@ des change the direction in which they are be@@ amed with sound impulses that have too high frequencies for the human ear to be heard .
the impulses work through the switch @-@ on of Mot@@ on@@ eur@@ on cells that are genetically modified to wear the membrane channels that respond to ultras@@ onic waves .
more about this topic : researchers read and write brain activity with light
the researchers said the worms showed the power of a new method called Son@@ o@@ genetic , in which ultrasound can be used to activate a number of brain , heart and muscle cells outside the body .
Sre@@ ek@@ an@@ th Chal@@ as@@ ani , researcher at the Sal@@ k Institute in La J@@ oll@@ a , California , told the Guardian that the procedure of one day could replace the deep brain stimulation , an invasive procedure that releases electrical impulses in the brain of people to treat the symptoms of Parkinson &apos;s disease .
thread worms usually do not react to ultrasound , but Chal@@ as@@ ani found that they did it when they were surrounded by a liquid with micro@@ scopic bubbles .
the bubbles , he found out , ampli@@ fy the ultras@@ onic waves , which then penetrate the worms .
the ampli@@ fied ultras@@ onic waves act on structures called TR@@ P @-@ 4 ion channels and are found in the membranes of some of the worms .
the sound waves cause the opening of these ion channels and activate the cells they are assigned , such as a report of Nature Communications .
to create ultrasound @-@ controlled n@@ em@@ ato@@ des , Chal@@ as@@ ani genetically modified the worms in such a way that some of their mot@@ on@@ eur@@ ons carry TR@@ P @-@ 4 ion channels .
when applied ultrasound to the modified creatures , the sound waves are ampli@@ fied by the micro@@ ves@@ icles and transferred to the worms , where they turn on the modified mot@@ on@@ eur@@ ons .
the procedure has some simil@@ arities with op@@ to@@ genetic , a ground@@ breaking tool that allows scientists to turn on and off neur@@ ons with impulses of light .
but Chal@@ as@@ ani said that Son@@ o@@ genetic might have some advantages over this technique .
in contrast to light , which has to be sent down to the desired place in the brain , low @-@ frequency ultras@@ onic waves can pass un@@ hin@@ dered and can thus be sent to the brain from above on the skull .
&quot; we believe that with gene therapy and a therapeutic virus it is possible to temporarily make the targeted human neur@@ ons vulnerable to the ultrasound signal in a clinical setting for certain neuro@@ logical treatments , &quot; said Chal@@ as@@ ani .
other applications could focus on muscle cells and insulin @-@ producing cells , he added .

according to Gav@@ in Grin@@ don , cur@@ ator of Cru@@ e@@ ol designs and lecturer at the University of Es@@ sex , artists will become more critical and attempt to bring political work to the audience outside galleries .
many artists are working with activists within protest movements to work and notice that they have to go out into the real world outside so that their art has an influence on society .
another of the anti @-@ arms trade posters greet commuters in the subway .
the Am@@ ne@@ sty video was viewed more than 100,000 times in 24 hours via Facebook and was created by the advertising agency V@@ C@@ CP , which works non @-@ profit with the graphic artist and Vo@@ ic@@ e@@ Over @-@ artist , who also works for free .
V@@ C@@ CP Creative Director Matt L@@ ever was amazed at the silence that reigned around the advertising for the ce@@ ase@@ fire - and thought , &quot; Give them the campaign they try to avoid . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they played with the invention of a more realistic shad@@ y company advertising , but &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by the blu@@ ep@@ r@@ ints with bright colors and animation , it remains stronger . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they have done a fantastic job by helping us to raise awareness of the sale of illegal torture equipment at the fair , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Tom Davi@@ es of Am@@ ne@@ sty . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
what we need now is an intervention of the British government and the guarantee that torture instruments are not illeg@@ ally tra@@ ded on our door@@ step .
perhaps the most creative arts around the arms trade fair comes from the area within Ex@@ Ce@@ L , where exhibitors will f@@ end fantastic eu@@ ph@@ em@@ istic products .

eight golden rules for living in student homes
eleven years ago , as a self @-@ forgotten 19 @-@ year @-@ old I moved to a student residence , still in faith in Ber@@ ets and moral rel@@ ati@@ vis@@ m , but only now I remember the ten@@ se smile of those who I anno@@ yed - and to the numerous , lengthy complaints about others .
most of what I have learned can be di@@ sti@@ lled into eight simple rules .
the entrance into residence halls ranges from slightly nerve @-@ picking up to absolutely terri@@ fying .
it is temp@@ ting to tie : people tell whence you come from , and where you have taken Sab@@ bat@@ Years , where you are in terms of Cor@@ by@@ n and why you &quot; hon@@ estly said Mar@@ m@@ ite neither love nor hate , because in ear@@ nest , guys , it &apos;s just a yeast extract ha@@ ha@@ ha , I am in my room . &quot;
breathe through .
and help others to do the same thing - Ask questions and show interest .
it direc@@ ts the conversation and helps you find out the people you like in contrast to those you wouldn &apos;t speak with , even if your lashes were burned in fire and these fire extingu@@ ish@@ ers were .
let &apos;s get people .
the rooms of people often turn into drinks form@@ ulations , film night events venues and community meeting points , but they are also the places where people attract and put on their under@@ wear .
related to this : don &apos;t forget to start a relationship with your university
intro@@ vert will receive a rough treatment at the university .
your room should be a refuge , but many student residen@@ ces form a room @-@ to @-@ room @-@ b@@ um@@ mel culture that is friendly and social and can lead to life @-@ long friendship .
this can be hell for someone trying to recover .
nothing in culture allows you to say : &quot; I like you and I want our friendship to go on , but you have to go away so that I get back the energy that I have consumed for the interaction with you . &quot;
try to feel when a fellow student is exhausted by soci@@ alizing - and send him an SMS instead of kno@@ cking .
apro@@ pos plan@@ ing : do it .
a guy in my student residen@@ ces had the idea that an un@@ locked door was an invitation .
he saw some things .
friendship with B@@ aking .
since you start the university at the height of the back man@@ ia , the kno@@ cking at the doors of people to imagine with a plate full of brow@@ ni@@ es is less strange than the welcome of the 1950 &quot; s &quot; welcome in the neighborhood , I have baked something . so , and now please smile when I ask you some personal questions . &quot;
offering homemade treats is a good way to make friends .
your room@@ mates feel obliged to talk and will eventually associate your face with a delicious surprise .
of course , this depends on whether you are a decent bakery .
bad mixed l@@ ump of flour , sugar and fat lead people sleeping when you drop .
ste@@ aling food is a common crime in student residen@@ ces .
of course , the c@@ law of chicken is a theft , but is it taking a drop of milk for your tea also ?
check that with the milk owner .
chances are good that they say to use themselves , even if they cook inside .
if someone ste@@ als your stuff , it &apos;s annoying and you have my compassion - but try to deal with it as my room@@ mate , who added a washing liquid to her milk to punish thi@@ eves .
she is now in prison .
they should not make any noise that keeps people from sleep or from work .
it is not just about being a decent person , but that you belong in the true sense of the pro@@ verb to the people sitting in the glas@@ sh@@ ouse .
a girl in my hall@@ way asked her neighbors , whether it makes them something , drum &amp; bass a bit qui@@ eter than at three o &apos;clock in the morning , and she had a test in the morning .
they responded with even more loud music .
when she finally heard about 5 o &apos;clock , she kindly allowed her neighbours to sleep two hours before she let her own music rang , shut her door and went to her three hour exam .
wouldn &apos;t it be romantic if your future spouse would accidentally move into the same student residence ?
conver@@ sely , it wouldn &apos;t be deep embarrass@@ ing if you hold a room@@ mate for your future spouse to go to them , separate yourself and then see them every day and perhaps experience how they all mig@@ rate together to each other ?
of course , the heart goes its own way - but if a hot room@@ mate is definitely not your future spouse , try at least to speak a little reason to your abdom@@ en .
in the exciting moment you notice that someone has his keys in his un@@ locked room , the border between an ul@@ k and bul@@ lying is fin@@ er than it seems .
a good stroke is funny , but it only takes moments until it becomes a bo@@ omer@@ ang .
by hiding a valuable and am@@ using lesson on security - but never def@@ rost any one &apos;s room with tooth@@ paste and sham@@ poo .
close your door , and place your keys in a glass of water , which you then put in the freezer - but do not t@@ ack your hol@@ dings at the ceiling more than twice .
terra@@ ced houses for Refu@@ ge@@ es , Sol@@ di@@ ers , Ger@@ ing@@ ver@@ servants
the real estate entrepren@@ eur Markus Gil@@ dner builds in the Middle @-@ Fran@@ con@@ ian Eck@@ ental terra@@ ced houses for people who don &apos;t have much money .
for example , for refugees - but also as a signal : &quot; not only refugees do not need a room for living , but also the mother and the ear@@ ner who are educ@@ ators alone . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I show how to build good and well @-@ built today , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the 44 @-@ year @-@ old in an interview . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
thousands of refugees are displaced to the housing market .
the entrepren@@ eur Markus Gil@@ bert believes to know how quickly affordable housing can be created : he builds in a project terra@@ ced houses for refugees .
Mr. Gil@@ bert , many refugees are being pushed to the housing market .
what solution do you offer ?
Markus Gil@@ dner : the mass housing in containers or gy@@ ms has no sustainability .
for people remain a great part here .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in view of the stream of refugees , we need enough space for the next few decades . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a completely ban@@ al , three @-@ storey semi @-@ detached house is the solution .
guil@@ der : a terra@@ ced house needs a minimum of space .
it facilitates integration .
this is different if the people are accommod@@ ated in blocks of living .
each of the six houses , which are currently being built in the pilot project , consists of three residential units for four asylum seek@@ ers each .
each unit has two bedrooms , a bathroom , a kitchen and a lounge .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it can be that many refugees will say it is peace , I go back . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
then the houses can be easily converted according to their needs .
how high are the costs ?
guil@@ d : the price for 160 square meters of living space per house amounts to 184 000 Euros , without property .
this is man@@ a@@ geable .
the construction lasted six months .
this is appropriate .
have the building regulations complicated their plans ?
guil@@ der : I have dra@@ gged my project correctly .
it is particularly complicated that it is always the lo@@ oming dam sword of special construction and the Rest@@ ri@@ ction Ord@@ in@@ ance .
sp@@ ook@@ y .
it is still under@@ lined who creates three apartments in a terra@@ ced house , needs at least three plots .
only in cities is the place missing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; refugees and asylum seek@@ ers have no cars . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
how did local residents react to their terra@@ ced project ?
guil@@ d : there were those who accused me of creating luxury buildings for asylum seek@@ ers .
which is definitely not true .
but do you not tigh@@ ten the competition for affordable housing ?
Gil@@ bert : true is : we had a building boom in Germany over the last five years , but we have built luxury apartments that can hardly afford any more .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my project has the message , even the normal people need living space . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
not only refugees , but also the single mother or of the Ger@@ ing@@ ver@@ servants .
I &apos;ll show you how to build good and well @-@ built today .
that &apos;s why it is all about .

iOS 9 : how to get the new iPhone operating system when Apple update is released
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the new operating system can be requested by going to the recruitment app , type &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; General &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and then select &quot; Software Update . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if it is ready , the phone gives you the option to download and then install .
some have encountered problems after installation , since they receive an error message telling that the &quot; software update failed . &quot;
to deal with the problem , users are advised to either wait until the ons@@ lau@@ ght returns or attempt to update via iTunes .
the phone itself leads you through the rest of the process .
this may mean del@@ eting apps to create space - but Apple has made it more likely due to the stream@@ lining of the update . similarly , it will be easier to do this if you use a special tool to delete apps and then re@@ install them as soon as the process is complete .
it is worthwhile to ensure that your mobile phone is charged during the update or is near a charger , so that the battery is charged .
if the load is too low , Apple does not allow the update to be continued , as the phone could possibly switch to half way and this could lead to a down@@ turn of the update .

Ros@@ enberg &apos;s sole motto : full attack
N@@ ico Ros@@ berg knows only one motto in the fight for the World Cup title in Formula 1 against his clearly leading Mercedes team @-@ mate Lewis Hamilton : &quot; full attack . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the World Cup second emphasized the decisive seven overseas races ahead of the start , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that I have nothing to lose . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
53 points separate the vice world champion in front of the race in Singapore on this Sunday of defending champion and double champion Hamilton .
the Br@@ ite already won seven of the twelve season races and takes the floo@@ d@@ light Grand Prix in the city state as a favorite in attack .
in 2009 and last year , the 30 @-@ year old Br@@ ite was able to win the race .
whether the current smo@@ g in the city state will have influence on the Grand Prix of Singapore is still unclear .
for days a ha@@ ze @-@ bell hangs over the city , triggered by fires on the neighbouring island of Sum@@ atra .
bad Kis@@ singer Schach@@ club has a prominent member
the chess club &quot; Schach@@ freunde Bad Kis@@ singen , &quot; which was founded three months ago , has added another member in its ranks , thus increasing the number of members to 19 players .
the new member is the entrepren@@ eur Paul G@@ aus@@ el@@ mann , a passionate chess and tennis player who stayed in Bad Kis@@ singen more than 40 times in Bad Kis@@ singen .
G@@ aus@@ el@@ mann is the carrier of the Federal Cross of Mer@@ it 1st Class and honorary citizen of the cities of Esp@@ el@@ kam@@ p and L@@ üb@@ be@@ cke .
G@@ aus@@ el@@ mann has supported the chess club in Bad Kis@@ singen with a donation which was accepted by the chairman Alfred Klein .
this makes it possible to record chess players who cannot record the membership fee .
youth work and talent search should also be pushed forward .
G@@ aus@@ el@@ mann wants the membership in the chess club and also a friendly contact with the tennis club &quot; Red @-@ White &quot; as an expression of its connec@@ t@@ edness with the spa town .
district office seeks direct contact
Sal@@ u@@ dis and the Alten@@ zentrum Anton@@ isti@@ ft have joined forces under the man@@ tle of the social foundation and opened a new starting point at the Graf @-@ Stau@@ ff@@ enberg @-@ Platz .
in addition to consultations , one can also participate in courses there .
the social foundation pul@@ ls it down from the mountain into the city centre .
more precisely to the Graf @-@ Stau@@ ff@@ enberg @-@ Platz .
there was recently opened a new district office .
here , immediately next to the shopping market , sen@@ iors and advice @-@ seek@@ ers receive information on questions such as nursing insurance or health and nursing insurance benefits .
for years , our ambul@@ ant care service has been established that often nur@@ turing relatives are left alone .
there are so many questions .
&quot; many of the services of the insurance companies are not rarely used because the complexity of insur@@ ances is hardly understood , &quot; explained the new landlord J@@ utta W@@ eig@@ and , who is also responsible for the Anton@@ isti@@ ft and the citizen hospital as a business assistant , and for the out@@ patient service &quot; Ama@@ de@@ us . &quot;
in addition to the consultations , the new district office also offers prevention , health and wellness .
for this purpose the Sal@@ u@@ dis was taken into the boat .
therefore , additional offers such as fall prevention , memory training or physi@@ o@@ therapeutic treatment can be used .
the offers from the retirement center and the Sal@@ u@@ dis complement each other in an ideal way .
Sal@@ u@@ dis stands for prevention , prevention and rehabilitation .
&quot; the retirement center for care and care , &quot; said Hei@@ ke R@@ ie@@ del , Managing Director of Sal@@ u@@ dis .
the reason for the opening of the new district office in the city centre is the result of both business leaders in demographic change .
because this makes a good decentr@@ alised infrastructure in the individual districts of Bam@@ berg in the future essential .
in addition , mayor Wolfgang Metz@@ ner ( SPD ) under@@ lined the inauguration celebrations , dedic@@ ates itself to the association &apos;s office as well : &quot; there are numerous events and offers on the agenda and they invite to a regular soci@@ al@@ ising . &quot;
the social foundation thus makes a big contribution to the fact that senior citizens can live as independently and well in their familiar environment .
the accommodation office is open Monday , Wednesday and Friday from 9 a.m. to 2 p.m. , Tuesday and Thursday from 16 a.m. to 6 p.m. and Satur@@ days from 10 a.m. to 12 p.m .

men beat on 17 @-@ year @-@ old Afgh@@ ans
witnesses are looking for the police for a incident in Bad So@@ den @-@ Sal@@ mün@@ ster : on Friday evening , at 23.@@ 45 hrs , three young men were on foot from Bad So@@ den in the direction of Sal@@ mün@@ ster .
one out of the group , a sev@@ ent@@ een @-@ year @-@ old Afgh@@ an , was following the police with his two friends at a distance of about five meters and called them to wait for him .
at that time the group was at the height of the b@@ ft gas station .
there were also three persons on the site of the gas station .
one of these men cried out to the young boy and hit the face with the f@@ ist .
the victim suffered from a nas@@ al hem@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ ge and ble@@ ed strongly out of the nose .
when his two friends hur@@ ried and appe@@ aled to the bat , he first left his victim .
the injured young man was brought home from his friends .
the perpet@@ r@@ ator pursued the group with a passenger car up to the apartment and drove there demonstr@@ atively several times .
when one no longer saw the vehicle , the injured one went in front of the building to smoke a cigarette .
there he was attacked again by the bat and another male member .
under the help of a stroke , one checked on the face and thi@@ ghs of the victim .
the injured person had to be hospit@@ alized for medical care .
so far only a vag@@ ue item description is available .
one of the men was about 1,80 meters tall .
the second ra@@ cket was supposed to have been about 1.@@ 65 meters tall and was dressed with a je@@ ans and a brown @-@ white shirt .

Dr. Frank Müller takes over practice Fel@@ lows and inv@@ ests € 3@@ 10@@ 000
Silvia Müller @-@ Gon@@ gol@@ l and Frank Müller ( from left ) take over the practice of Karl @-@ Heinrich and Ur@@ sel Fel@@ steh@@ ausen .
the mayor Bernd Bor@@ mann , econom@@ ist U@@ ta Sei@@ m @-@ Schwar@@ tz and A@@ sen@@ dor@@ fs mayor Hein@@ fried Kab@@ bert , are also happy about this .
in many places in the country doctors - A@@ sen@@ dorf , on the other hand , is lucky : Dr. Frank Müller takes over the practice Fel@@ ber ausen on October 1 .
while Ur@@ sel &apos;s reti@@ ring goes into retirement , her husband Karl @-@ Heinrich is still on his side in the next few months .
after a reconstruction phase Müller opened the practice on 12 October , until then he invested 3@@ 10@@ 000 euros in the premises at St@@ .-@@ Mar@@ cell@@ us@@ strasse 6 .
it was sympathy at first sight when the ri@@ ms met Frank Müller and his wife , Dr. Silvia Müller @-@ Gon@@ gol@@ l , who currently completed their specialist training at the Ver@@ den Hospital and will also go into practice this year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we always had in mind that the mill@@ ers would fit well into this practice , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Dr. Ur@@ sel Fel@@ steh@@ ausen and laughs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; when it was so far , I simply called them . &quot;
the married couple Müller liked the idea of running his own practice in A@@ sen@@ dorf in the future .
&quot; the proximity and constant contact to the patients are very attractive to us , &quot; says the 39 @-@ year @-@ old Müller .
&quot; we want to know and accompany the families over the years . &quot;
as an advantage , he can see his own boss as soon as possible .
and so they agreed , the mill@@ ers bought the house with practice .
however , they will continue to live in Bruch@@ hausen @-@ Vil@@ sen .
the two @-@ time father Frank Müller has also grown up there , his medical studies in Hanover followed stations in several doctor &apos;s offices as well as in hospitals in Sul@@ ingen , Ni@@ enburg and Rot@@ enburg .
he is currently working as a senior physician in Sul@@ ingen , and in 2009 he was appointed chief physician in the Di@@ ep@@ holz group and is engaged in the DR@@ K @-@ readiness of Bruch@@ hausen @-@ Vil@@ sen .
starting September 19 , the practice will be prepared for the new boss .
while the surgeon Dr. Karl @-@ Heinrich Fel@@ steh@@ ausen works as a family doctor , his wife Ur@@ sel ( Inter@@ nis@@ tin ) special@@ ises in gastro@@ enter@@ ology .
the mill@@ ers , both inter@@ ne@@ sts , want to settle down as a home doctor .
&quot; the end@@ os@@ copy therefore comes out , &quot; says the 38 @-@ year @-@ old Silvia Müller @-@ Gon@@ gol@@ l .
after the renovation the rooms will look modern .
we will offer more ultrasound examinations as well as long @-@ term and stress EC@@ Gs and need a room more .
in addition , the ED@@ V is completely renewed .
a subsi@@ dy of a total of 50@@ 000 Euros will be allocated to the land@@ fill in the framework of a funding programme of the district ( 25@@ 000 Euro ) and the seed community ( 12@@ 500 Euro ) and the municipality ( 12@@ 500 Euro ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this shows how proud and happy we are that the practice is continued , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Samsung &apos;s Mayor Bernd Bor@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to Silvia Müller @-@ Gon@@ gol@@ l , about 2000 patients come into practice in the field of rock @-@ breaks every quarter , in the North German average there are about 500 .
there is another GP practice in A@@ sen@@ dorf .
a positive side effect of the tak@@ eover by Frank Müller : according to Ur@@ sel , the pharmacy remains in A@@ sen@@ dorf .
if no successor could have found herself , she would have gone too .
who visits Müll@@ ers &apos;s consultation hour , by the way , still looks particularly in familiar faces : takes over the seven medical specialists and the cleaning power of the ri@@ ms .
with their f@@ arewell in A@@ sen@@ dorf an era ends , after all the doctors have practiced there for 30 years .
&quot; at the beginning we had only two rooms , &quot; Ur@@ sel remembered ri@@ len@@ eck .
after a long time , a little sad@@ ness has already felt .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but we live in Hohen@@ mo@@ or and will certainly see many patients often , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the Inter@@ nis@@ tin . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; her husband says laugh@@ ing : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have a 6,000 square meter plot . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so far I have always pressed myself from gardening , now it could be different . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition , the pair has two grand@@ children and likes to travel .
Croatia : &quot; we let the refugees pass through &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now the border controls are also raised at our southern border , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Interior Minister Joh@@ anna Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the controls on the Hungarian border remain in parallel .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; still , it is clear that anyone who wants to put an asylum application can &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the care and safety of the people stands in the foreground .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but it is clear , however , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that it needs clear signals , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the minister . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; people need to know that we do not accept bor@@ der@@ less migration flows , even beyond the Austrian @-@ Slovenian border . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it needs a controlled approach .
Croatia is considering &quot; Cor@@ ridor &quot; - Slovenia refuses
the Croatian government had previously announced that Slovenia would continue to travel on arriving refugees in the direction of Austria and Germany and may also set up cor@@ rid@@ ors for the refugees .
the interior minister Ves@@ na Gy@@ ör@@ kö@@ s Z@@ ni@@ dar in Lai@@ bach did not look like this .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the idea of cor@@ rid@@ ors is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; absolutely unacceptable , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Slovenia would rather intensi@@ fy the surveillance of the border - especially to Hungary . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the other hand , the border with Croatia is already highly controlled as the outer border of the Schengen area .
like the Minister of Ministers , Slovenia is trying to limit its limits to refugees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; every member of the EU must fill out its obligations , otherwise the system cannot work , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stressed Gy@@ ör@@ kö@@ s Z@@ ni@@ dar . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
as the Croatian government announced that the first refugees tried to leave in eastern Croatia at the border crossing T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik / S@@ id to avoid registration .
the Croatian police were able to attack them in the near fields of corn .
according to local media , police vehicles with new refugees ever since arrived in the Croatian town of T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik .
it is primarily a matter of Syrians and Afgh@@ ans , including numerous women and children .
rescue services and the Red Cross are already in use .
in the coming days his country reck@@ oned with around 4,000 refugees , said Interior Minister R@@ ank@@ o O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic .
in addition , buses from Pres@@ evo to the Mac@@ ed@@ onian @-@ Ser@@ b border , which had previously brought migrants to the Hungarian border , would have diver@@ ted Croatia and Serbian media on Wednesday .
however , the Belgrade government denied that it was to suggest people to suggest certain routes : &quot; neither can we , nor do we want to do it , &quot; it was said .
according to the media reports , in the morning , a first bus with around 50 refugees arrived in the Serbian border town S@@ id , in the course of the day further buses would be expected .
about Croatia , Slovenia and Austria to Germany
the occup@@ ants had been travelling throughout the night from the Mac@@ ed@@ onian border that was around 500 kilometers away from Serbia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have heard that Hungary has admitted , so the police told us that we should go here , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said one of the refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they wanted to travel to Germany through Croatia , Slovenia and Austria .
as a result , the postpon@@ ed displacement of the previous Balkan Route Turkey @-@ Greece @-@ Macedonia @-@ Serbia @-@ Hungary could actually come to a somewhat further west route .
Croatia : &quot; comprehensive border control options &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Croatia &apos;s Interior Minister O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic pointed out that his country had prepared appropriate plans for possible exceptional situations in the event of a strong influ@@ x of refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he did not mention the details , but he pointed out that Croatia as non @-@ Schengen member has &quot; comprehensive border control options . &quot;
strict controls are carried out in order to qualify for membership in the Schengen area .
Slovenia has been part of this since 2007 , the EU partners have consistently obtained a good testimony to the country , concerning the standard of border controls .
on the Serbian side there are still 300 refugees stuck behind the Hungarian border fence .
according to Bel@@ gra@@ der &apos;s media reports , they had spent the last night at the border crossing of Hor@@ gos , which leads to R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke .
according to the Hungarian authorities , the two border cross@@ ings Hor@@ gos and Back@@ i Bre@@ g continue to be completely blocked .
whether the remaining refugees are now going to go on to the Croatian border is still unclear .
the Serbian interior minister N@@ ebo@@ j@@ sa Stef@@ an@@ ovic tried to calm down Wednesday morning with a local note in Hor@@ gos : he stops the debates on alternative routes of refugees after the Hungarian border has now been closed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there would be no very high number of refugees at this time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
one cannot say whether they would continue their journey through Hungary , Croatia or another country .
hel@@ pers advise migrants - dangerous - alternative routes
however , private Hungarian refugee shel@@ ters have already begun distributing maps on which alternative routes are marked by Croatia .
however , the border crossing between Serbia and Croatia is not safe : in parts of the border area there are also 20 years after the end of the Croatian war still not cleared min@@ e@@ fields .
on Wednesday afternoon the Croatian police announced that a team of mine clear@@ ers was sent to the border region .
counter h@@ ack@@ ers : Ukra@@ inians pay $ 30 million
Sup@@ ran@@ on@@ ok should have heard about a ring of cy@@ ber criminals who have been accused of having provided insight into even un@@ published financial reports and press releases on websites like Business Wire , Market@@ place and PR News@@ wire since 2010 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the captured information should have been made in@@ sider stores on the financial markets . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in this way , a total of more than 100 million dollars were launched to the investig@@ ators .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today &apos;s comparison shows that even those outside our borders will ultimately be caught , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says it in the SE@@ C message . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the proceedings against 32 further accused in the case continued .
most of the def@@ end@@ ants are from Ukraine and Georgia .
the perpet@@ rators are to act both in the USA and Eastern Europe .
ec@@ umen@@ ical hos@@ pi@@ ce Mannheim exists for 20 years
there is a lively operation around the Mannheim Par@@ ade@@ platz .
people do their worries , partly fast pac@@ ed , partly comfortably bum@@ bling .
they control the two stations of the Mannheim car park at the Par@@ ade@@ platz .
keep the city railways .
puls@@ ating , pl@@ ou@@ gh@@ ing life with wonderful autumn sunshine and in the midst of four big boards each with the heading &quot; Before I die I want .... &quot;
the E@@ cum@@ en@@ ical hos@@ pi@@ ce aid drew attention to her 20 years of existence with this action and is quite confronted with mixed reactions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s about life , so we went with the action in the middle of the city and among people , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Jos@@ ef@@ ine Lam@@ mer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the director of the E@@ cum@@ en@@ ical Hos@@ pi@@ ce remedy is also available to the p@@ asser@@ s @-@ by as well as for questions and talks like the volunteers .
while a Pass@@ ant interven@@ es spontaneously to the chal@@ k and &quot; affir@@ ming my life , &quot; &quot; reading &quot; with the camper through the US , &quot; &quot; stopping the war &quot; or &quot; not long suffering , &quot; others remain short , read , say sentences like &quot; so far I am not yet &quot; and go on .
again and again on the fr@@ inge of small discussions about the action itself , about life , dealing with dying .
also Peter H@@ üb@@ inger is on the spot .
&quot; only when I realize that at some point the end of this world comes , I can live responsi@@ bly , &quot; says Director of the Mannheim Di@@ ak@@ on Works , which is together with the Car@@ it@@ as@@ verband carrier of the E@@ cum@@ en@@ ical hos@@ pi@@ ce aid .
therefore , this public @-@ effective action is good for the 20 @-@ year @-@ old .
however , that not everyone wants to communicate publicly on the boards is understandable , after all , it is a very personal matter .
the subject of death and death is still attached to tab@@ oos , so the experience of Jos@@ ef@@ ine Lam@@ mer , although the hos@@ pi@@ ce movement in recent years has contributed much to the opening of the people .
an assessment that shares An@@ geli@@ ka Go@@ def@@ roid .
the death and mour@@ ning atten@@ dant is one of the volunteers of the first hour .
confronted by personal experience with the subject , she read a lot of literature and decided to get involved in eu@@ than@@ asia .
when the E@@ cum@@ en@@ ical hos@@ pi@@ ce was seeking volunteers by appeals , she immediately reported to her and was present at the founding in 1995 .
Go@@ def@@ roid belongs to a team of 45 volunteers - 43 women and two men - the affected and relatives in private households , hospitals , nursing homes and in the Hos@@ pi@@ z Sankt Vincent .
all of them are carefully trained .
Angel@@ ica Go@@ def@@ roid can handle her task and experience and experience .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I see life from another wart , consider it precious and appreciate the moment , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the offer of the ambul@@ ant E@@ cum@@ en@@ ical hos@@ pi@@ ce service is free of charge and denom@@ in@@ ational .
the financial support of the health insurance funds and donations of relatives and associations enables training as well as training and supervision of the death and mour@@ ning atten@@ d@@ ants .
every two years , training sessions will be offered for new employees .
the tables described on Saturday are now exhibited in the house of the Protestant Church ( M1 , 1@@ a ) and in the house of the Catholic Church ( F@@ 2 , 6 ) .

F@@ ed@@ Ex result mixed , financial prospects for 2016 lowered
F@@ ed@@ Ex reports dis@@ ap@@ pointing results for the last quarter , and the delivery giant lowered its profit outlook for a whole year due to the weaker demand for freight services and higher costs in its ground transport service .
the company also said that it plans to hire around 55@@ ,000 seasonal workers for the holiday .
at this time last year F@@ ed@@ Ex announced that the company would like to set 50,000 seasonal workers for the holiday season .
the share fell by 2.5 percent in the pre@@ market trade 45 minutes before the opening on Wednesday .
F@@ ed@@ Ex Corp. Anno@@ un@@ ces to earn $ 10.@@ 40 $ and $ 10,@@ 90 in the business year ending in May , 20 c@@ ents less than in previous forecast .
according to a survey of Fac@@ t@@ Set 10,@@ 84 $ , analysts expected .
the lower view comes despite the price increases , aver@@ aging 4.@@ 9 percent on the 4th of January and despite higher allow@@ ances for ground transportation of heavy and large packages , which will be collected from November onwards .
the company said it nonetheless expected that the result will increase compared to the previous year due to cost reduction , higher revenues and due to growth in online retail .
Chairman and CEO Fred Smith said that the company yields &quot; solid income , considering the weaker as expected economic conditions , especially in manufacturing and global trade . &quot;
the plans for the vacation rental were announced a day later than that of the Ri@@ val UPS , which plans to hire 9@@ 0,000 to 9@@ 5,000 additional workers , such as the same number as last year .
in the quarter that ended on 31 August , F@@ ed@@ Ex earned $ 6@@ 92 million , 6 percent more than in the previous year .
earnings per share amounted to $ 2.@@ 42 per share , just behind the 2.@@ 44 $ per share , which analysts predicted twelve of Z@@ acks Investment Research .
sales increased by 5 percent to 12.@@ 3 billion dollars .
six of Z@@ acks questioned analysts expected $ 12.@@ 23 billion .
in recent years , F@@ ed@@ Ex has recorded a decline in international priority shipping , which resulted in sales in its unit express shipping to stagn@@ ate .
but the boom in online shopping has increased the results at F@@ ed@@ Ex Ground .
in the last quarter , sales of bo@@ d@@ transport rose by 29 percent , but the operating result was basically flat because of higher costs for larger packages and self @-@ insurance .
the Express unit recorded higher earnings due to higher prices , while the result was falling due to higher labour costs in the freight business .
in the pre@@ market trade , about an hour before the opening , the F@@ ed@@ Ex shares fell by 3.@@ 85 $ , or 2.5 percent , to 15@@ 0.@@ 15 $ .
on Tuesday they closed with 11 percent loss for the year and 17 percent below a record high on June 11 .
on their most awa@@ ited session in the year , Federal Reserve strate@@ gi@@ sts spend two days a week around a 27 @-@ foot Hondur@@ an ma@@ ho@@ gan@@ y table to decide if it &apos;s time to raise the Lei@@ tz@@ ins for the first time for almost a decade .
lo@@ oming over them at one end of the decorated two @-@ storey meeting room is a mur@@ al of the United States .
the card is a reminder that the F@@ ed chair@@ woman Jan@@ et L. Y@@ ellen and her colleagues want to set the economic interests of the nation in front of all other things .
the central bank has a tw@@ o@@ fold mandate from Congress : maxim@@ izing US employment and prices stable here .
but since the big recession , the F@@ ed leaders have acknowledged that there is an un@@ written third mandate : financial stability .
and this third mandate could be the X factor in a decision that is too tight to predict it . it will be announced on Thursday whether the U.S. economy is ready to be we@@ aned from unprecedented incentives by the close @-@ to @-@ zero interest rate at the end of 2008 .
although most of the data of the economy show that it grows solid , the recent tur@@ mo@@ il in the global financial markets could make the cau@@ tious F@@ ed representatives anxi@@ ous to reinforce this volati@@ lity by raising the interest rate for federal bonds - and be it just a quarter of a percentage point .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; obviously , the labour market and inflation are primarily the most important thing they observe , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Lind@@ sey M. Pi@@ eg@@ za , chief econom@@ ist at the bro@@ ker company Sti@@ fel Nicol@@ aus &amp; Co . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I think if they were looking for a pre@@ text to increase the rate of interest , the increased uncertainty surrounding the global market is enough justification to continue &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is no consensus on what the F@@ ed will do , which sec@@ ures itself to the financial market itself .
about half of the econom@@ ists recently inter@@ viewed by Blo@@ om@@ berg have predicted an increase in interest this week .
the financial markets , however , expect a shut@@ down of the F@@ ed , with a key indicator that shows only a 30 % chance of an increase .
this indicates a decline in the stock market , if the F@@ ed increases the proposition , unless the strate@@ gi@@ sts sof@@ ten the blow by promising that another increase is far away .
on Tuesday the D@@ ow Jones Industrial A@@ verage weigh@@ ed 2@@ 28@@ ,@@ 89 points or 1.4 % to 16,@@ 59@@ 9,@@ 85 .
the action was triggered by expectations that the F@@ ed policy maintains the proposition this week , said John Lon@@ ski , chief econom@@ ist at M@@ oo@@ dy &apos;s Capital Markets Research Group .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it would be a surprise if the F@@ ed would raise the sentences at that time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if she does it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she would have to go very far in her statement to calm the financial markets so that they don &apos;t panic . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
other experts argued that interest rate would calm the financial markets because it would eliminate the uncertainty about when the F@@ ed would act .
a month ago , the F@@ ed seemed to increase the set by 0.@@ 25 percentage points this month , the first small step in a slow tigh@@ tening of monetary conditions that would test the strength of recovery in the US .
Y@@ ellen had said in spring and early summer that in this year , despite the complaints of liber@@ als that more economic progress would be required , an increase of the sentence was expected .
although the creation of jobs slow@@ ed in August , the improvement in the labour market was solid this year .
the unemployment rate decreased to 5.1 % last month , the lowest for over seven years and near the level that the F@@ ed sees as full employment .
wage increases have shown signs of recovery .
and although inflation was constantly under the annual target of 2 % of the central bank , the F@@ ed representatives said that the main reason was the temporary effect of significantly lower oil prices .
the economy &quot; can handle higher interest rates and needs it because of tension on the labour market , &quot; said Ian Sh@@ ep@@ her@@ dson , Chief econom@@ ist at Pan@@ the@@ on Macro@@ economics .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but the financial markets around the world joined the end of the last month after China had de@@ valued its currency . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the D@@ ow Jones Industrial A@@ verage Rate fell by more than 16 % in May , as investors were afraid that a slow@@ down of the Chinese economy would throt@@ tle global growth .
the market has recovered slightly this month , whereas the D@@ ow is now around 10 % below the pole of May .
for the F@@ ed representatives , the market turbul@@ ences affect the complex calculation when increasing interest rates .
&quot; if the events on the financial markets and the news on the weakness of the Chinese economy had not occurred in the past few weeks , they would attract the re@@ ins at this meeting , &quot; said Stephen D. O@@ liner , Senior Research Fel@@ low at U@@ C@@ LA Zim@@ an Center for Real Estate and a former staff of the US central bank .
now he predic@@ ts that she will wait at least one month to get better grip on the effects .
&quot; there is a lot of uncertainty about what the impact on the US economy will be , and there are almost no reliable data describing the developments in China , &quot; said O@@ liner .
the health of the global economy is not one of the main concerns of the F@@ ed , so it should be technically not included in the decision making process .
but in the end , the F@@ ed currency authority has become the world .
the influence of the central bank was enormous in recent years .
the mere indication of the former director Ben S. Bern@@ anke in 2013 that the F@@ ed could &quot; narrow down their monetary expansion &quot; triggered confusion around the globe .
in a world where markets and economies are increasingly inter@@ tw@@ ined , the F@@ ed representatives are expected to not only monitor developments elsewhere , but also consult other central banks and experts to gain a better understanding of the global economy .
her decision @-@ making is &quot; more art than science , &quot; said Zach@@ ary Kar@@ ab@@ ell , head of the global strategy for asset management of En@@ v@@ est@@ net Inc .
Jeff@@ rey Lack@@ er , President of the Federal Reserve Bank of Rich@@ mond , VA . , noted this month that &quot; the F@@ ed has a history of transactions on financial market movements that are apparently not associated with economic fundament@@ als . &quot;
Lack@@ er , Member of the Federal Open Market Committee , who advoc@@ ates an increase in interest , quoted decisions in 1998 / 1999 as an example .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the F@@ ed added a financial crisis in Asia to reduce its body interest by 0.@@ 75 percentage points in three sessions &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; despite a limited apparent impact on growth in the US . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
one year later , the F@@ ed representatives vo@@ iced these cuts .
the F@@ ed should first put aspects of financial stability to the first place during a severe crisis like the Mark@@ tz@@ us@@ ammen@@ bruch 2008 , said Adam S. P@@ osen , former member of the Committee on Inter@@ est Rate of the Bank of England .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the latest turbul@@ ence does not come close to this level , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; she certainly doesn &apos;t want to get into the situation in which she is afraid of an increase in interest because the markets are exciting , &quot; said P@@ osen , President of the Peter@@ son Institute for International Economics .
the Federal Reserve Act still contains the dual mandate and does not mention financial stability , and until this is changed I do not believe that it should prec@@ ede the time .

Ho@@ y@@ ers@@ wer@@ da : small Leben@@ shilfe for Refu@@ ge@@ es
more and more refugees arrive in Germany this day .
to give you a warm welcome is not without the dedication of countless volunteer hel@@ pers .
also in Ho@@ y@@ ers@@ wer@@ da there are a number of people who support un@@ sel@@ fish asylum seek@@ ers in the city .
Petra and Klaus H@@ eine are among them .
Petra H@@ eine is a teacher with body and soul .
she still loves to teach her 74 l@@ ences .
every Thursday , she is doing it at asylum seek@@ ers at D@@ ill@@ inger Straße .
there they help refugees from Syria , Kur@@ dist@@ an , Kosovo and Pakistan to learn German language .
of course , this is quite different than at a proper school .
Brazil &apos;s pa@@ edi@@ at@@ ric society Rio Grande promotes nutrition for healthy breast@@ feeding
Brazilian pa@@ edi@@ at@@ ric organization SP@@ RS attempts to clarify how important good nutrition is during breast@@ feeding . it does this with the presentation of images of babies that su@@ ck breasts that are painted with represent@@ ations of un@@ healthy foods .
breast milk consists of a variety of proteins , fats , vitamins and carbohydrates that give babies all the nutrients they need to build a strong immune system .
due to the additional energy requirements pregnant and young mothers are advised to increase their daily calorie intake by about 500 calories per day .
however , new research suggests that higher calorie intake is not the only dietary adjustment that mothers should do .
a recent study conducted by Robert Water@@ land , Professor at Bay@@ lor College of Medicine in Texas , showed that a healthy diet actually affects women &apos;s genes and protects them from the development of tumours .
unfortunately , an un@@ healthy diet of the child can adver@@ sely affect the immune system .
exceptions for the new Bern@@ rie@@ der sports hall
the Municipal Council of Bern@@ ried approved the construction application for the 2.3 million euro sports hall .
and he made an exception .
the roof may be fl@@ atten@@ ed for solar installation .
the plans for the long @-@ awa@@ ited Turn@@ halle Building at Bern@@ rie@@ der Sport@@ welt are progres@@ sing step by step : in the recent council meeting , the revised construction application was unanim@@ ously agreed with no big discussions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before the committee , among other things , a proposal for a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; exemp@@ tion &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; exemp@@ tion &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from the valid development plan had been decided . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Exc@@ eption &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was the permission for a special form concerning the roof construction . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to this , a &quot; saddle roof with a non @-@ central first and roof super@@ structure &quot; is to be erected .
background of the planning is the planned use of the roof area for solar systems : &quot; in this way , we get a wonderfully large south roof , &quot; explained mayor Josef St@@ eigen@@ berger in the meeting .
at &quot; liberation &quot; it was again about the roof inclin@@ ation , which is supposed to be below ten degrees for energy reasons - unlike in the development plan .
this significantly reduces the volume of the hall .
a &quot; liberation &quot; was therefore necessary because the development plan in relation to the roof inclin@@ ation does not allow &quot; exceptions , &quot; whereby Bern@@ rie@@ der Municipal Council generally does not drive restric@@ tively in the case of exemp@@ tion orders .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , a repeat project is not a recurring project : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we do not create a preced@@ ent , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; St@@ eigen@@ berger . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the gym building at the Sports Centre is a joint project of the municipality and the S@@ V Bern@@ ried .
at the cost , some 2.3 million euros are calculated .
subsidies are expected from school and Brei@@ ten@@ sport@@ sponsor@@ ing .
in the next step , the building application for the 18 x 36 metres large hall is now presented to the district council office for testing .
clinic P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg moves to Sch@@ ong@@ au
the P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg Hospital is planned to be closed earlier than planned - namely 2016 .
at the same time , Dr. Wilhelm Fischer ( 66 ) is appointed new medical director at the Sch@@ ong@@ au Hospital .
the station and the majority of the employees move from P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg to Sch@@ ong@@ au .
this shows the surprising plans of the hospital GmbH of the county , confirmed by the coun@@ cill@@ or Andrea J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiß .
however , a decision on this will meet the Supervisory Board , and the next Wednesday will be September 23 .
should the plans be implemented , then all of the nearly 50 staff would be employed at the hospital in P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg .
the overwhelming majority should move to Sch@@ ong@@ au with Fischer and the further existing In@@ ner Station .
the rooms are available .
in Wei@@ l@@ heim , employees who cannot come to Sch@@ ong@@ au should be offered a workplace in Wei@@ l@@ heim , such as J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiß .
employees are informed about the plans .
the change has triggered the termination of Dr. Andreas E@@ der , who is the director of the Sch@@ ong@@ auer Klinik since the beginning of the year and now changes to a private practice in close proximity to the hospital .
according to J@@ och@@ ner @-@ White , the name &quot; Fischer &quot; came into play , who agreed to take over the direction from October 1 and switch to Sch@@ ong@@ au with his team .
for the house in Sch@@ ong@@ au this meant a &quot; appreciation &quot; in every case and a wi@@ dening of the offer in the field of &quot; internal medicine , &quot; says J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiß .
Fischer is a specialist for pac@@ em@@ akers and de@@ fi@@ bri@@ ll@@ ators .
Sch@@ ong@@ au ( 180 beds ) is specialized in gastro@@ enter@@ ologic illnesses on the inside of the station .
for the next two years , if the Supervisory Board agrees to appro@@ ve both houses until the next year , the former hospital of the group , which has more than 35 beds , will finally be closed in P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg after almost 140 years .
until now , the county has planned this for 2018 if the current refur@@ bish@@ ment at the Wei@@ l@@ heim Hospital has been completed .
Land@@ rä@@ tin J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiß , who is also chairman of the Supervisory Board , met rum@@ ors that the house , which is owned by the Federal Co@@ unc@@ ill@@ or , should be used as an accommodation for asylum seek@@ ers in the future .
&quot; I exclude it . &quot; as it continues with the property , J@@ och@@ ner @-@ White could not say , there are several considerations .
there are currently a short @-@ term care of Car@@ itas and a day@@ time psychiat@@ ry .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what better could not happen to us , such an opportunity does not come back , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Fischer on the Qu@@ asi move to the Le@@ ch , which was received positively by the staff &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there was no real perspective for the house where Fischer has been working as chief physician for more than 30 years .
he was asked by Sch@@ ong@@ auer colleagues to take over the post of the medical director .
the hospital P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg ( once 100 beds ) was again threatened by closure in recent decades , departments were closed , for example the surgery and the obst@@ et@@ rics .
the hand b@@ aller of the Rhein @-@ Neck@@ ar lions are demanded tonight ( 20.@@ 15 pm ) at the Berg@@ ischen HC .
although the leader of the league of the Bundes@@ lig@@ a in Wuppertal is the clear favourite , there is no reason for arro@@ gan@@ ce .
in the past season , the Bad@@ ener took a painful defeat at Bh@@ c and got something good there .
hunting event with two injured at Pr@@ at@@ au
two tractor drivers were seriously injured during their ma@@ ize harvest on Tuesday afternoon by shots .
during the super@@ sti@@ tion on a corn field near Pr@@ at@@ au ( district Witt@@ enberg ) several h@@ unters were in use , as the police hur@@ ried .
after a shot , a 63@@ - and a 22 @-@ year @-@ old man suffered severe injuries and were brought to hospital .
it was unclear how exactly it could come to the accident .
the crime police identified .
missing 16 @-@ year @-@ old from Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate victims of violent crimes
a suspect has led the police to the cor@@ p@@ se of the 16 @-@ year @-@ olds of Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate which have been missing since Saturday .
in the inter@@ ro@@ gation , the 20 @-@ year @-@ old admitted that the young@@ sters were killed and their bodies were thrown into a channel in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen .
a 16 @-@ year @-@ old from Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate , which has been missing since Saturday , has fallen victim to a violent crime .
the body of the young woman was found on Tuesday evening in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen near Kais@@ ers@@ lau@@ tern , as public prosec@@ ut@@ ors and police were wed@@ ged on Wednesday .
the 20 @-@ year @-@ old , captured on Tuesday evening , is also considered to be active and the investig@@ ator declared the place of discovery of the cor@@ p@@ ses .
the 16 @-@ year @-@ old had been reported missing on Sunday morning after having come home after a visit to a fall festival in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen on the eve after a visit to a fall festival in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen .
in the search for the young woman , the investig@@ ators first met personal objects of the victim .
in the case of ques@@ tioning in the circle of friends and acquain@@ tan@@ ces of the mis@@ chief , there was finally a crime against the 20 @-@ year @-@ old .
the alleged perpet@@ r@@ ator then led the police to a channel in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen , where the body was found .
according to the authorities , the det@@ ain@@ ee reported to the authorities that the 16 @-@ year @-@ old was killed and the cor@@ p@@ ses placed in the canal .
the 20 @-@ year @-@ old was to be introduced on Wednesday to the Haf@@ e@@ ater , the investig@@ ators put him to death .
the further investigation should bring about the near@@ er circumstances of the act .
refugees need accommodation : study warns of housing gap
the location on the German housing market is ten@@ se .
more and more refugees are looking for affordable pen@@ ises .
pressure on the housing market is growing .
social housing is facing a challenge .
the distribution struggles on the German housing market have long begun .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the upcoming refugees and job seek@@ ers from the EU , more and more people are pushing for a market that is already over@@ loaded in many big cities . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they compete with low @-@ income citizens around the last affordable housing .
in order to meet the demand for affordable housing , 400@@ ,000 new units have to be built by 2020 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the result of a study commissioned by the association &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; social housing construction . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for comparison , 26@@ 0,000 units will be completed in Germany this year .
in this way 14@@ 0,000 apartments are missing .
after the first three months of their stay , refugees are no longer obliged to live as asylum seek@@ ers in an initial shelter .
many then come to the housing market and place themselves in the long queu@@ es in front of the apartment rentals .
according to the Federal Statisti@@ cal Office , however , less than half of all asylum seek@@ ers lived for rent last year .
however , the negative development of the housing market is not only due to the increasing number of refugees .
the study also makes substantial om@@ is@@ sions in the housing policy of recent years .
Germany hi@@ des an apartment deficit in front of itself , which becomes bigger from year to year .
currently , around 77@@ 0,000 residential units were missing in the metrop@@ olitan areas , compl@@ ains Matthias Günther , author of the study .
for this reason many working people lived in big cities in need of WG @-@ rooms .
because of the lau@@ ts on the housing market young adults remained un@@ willingly in the &quot; Hotel Mama . &quot;
in large cities , the number of square meters per cap@@ ita has fallen for the first time in recent years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to solve the problem , the Alliance &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; social housing construction &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; suggests a re@@ boot . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
new incentives should be stimulated again in the process of social housing construction .
thus , the estate tax could be dispens@@ ed with and the property tax for subsi@@ dis@@ ed flats is temporarily suspended .
in addition , attractive tax amor@@ tis@@ ation options are necessary according to the Alliance .
the Kf@@ W funding programme is now well received by cities and municipalities .
a good week after the start on Monday evening with 184 million euros more than half of the available around 300 million euros had already been retri@@ eved .
now the project could even be increased .
refugees have free validity : Croatia and Slovenia wre@@ ak a corridor
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is practically no passing in Hungary , as more and more refugees choose the way to Croatia . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Zagreb is announc@@ ing a journey through Slovenia to the north without hur@@ d@@ les .
but the route is dangerous .
Croatia wants to communicate with the neighbouring country of Slovenia on the establishment of a corridor for refugees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have spoken with the Slovenian interior minister and if necessary we will organise a corridor , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Croatian Minister of Interior R@@ ank@@ o O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Slovenia is located between Croatia and Austria and is already part of the Schengen zone .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the EU country Croatia is not yet a Schengen country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the settlement of the Serbian @-@ Hungarian border , hundreds of refugees came to Croatia to get to Western Europe .
500 people have come across the border at T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik , the Croatian television station RT@@ L reports .
Hungary had closed off its border to refugees on the eve of the day .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; new laws that came into force on the same day make ordinary asylum procedures virtually unnecessary in Hungary . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Croatia wants to let the refugees pass .
the Croatian Prime Minister Zor@@ an Mil@@ an@@ ovic stated : &quot; you can travel through , and we are preparing for this opportunity . &quot;
these people are there , they are women , children and men who want to live and achieve something .
however , people who did not want to live in Croatia .
in the morning , the Croatian police attacked the first refugees on Serbia &apos;s border to the EU neighbouring country .
the majority of the media reports came from Syria , Iran and Afghanistan .
they came to the Serbian border town of S@@ id , both by bus and taxis .
immediately after their arrival , they would have tried to get on foot over the green border to Croatia .
at the Croatian @-@ Serbian border , the refugees do not meet fen@@ f@@ ences .
for this , the border strip contains other dangers : there are still sharp mines from the Yugosla@@ vian civil war in the 90@@ s .
mine clear@@ ers should now quickly create a safe passage .
however , after the closure of the border , no more refugees come to Hungary .
on Tuesday the police numbered 3@@ 66 people .
shortly before tor@@ sion on Monday there were 9@@ 380 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the new Hungarian La@@ ws stages the overcoming and damage of the border zone as a crime . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the South @-@ Hungarian border town Sz@@ eg@@ ed , 35 criminal proceedings were initiated .
the convic@@ ted convic@@ ted sentences of up to five years and deport@@ ation from the country .
according to the immigration authority , a total of 94 asylum applications were received on Tuesday in the newly established &quot; Tran@@ sit &quot; - almost all - 93 - at the most important transition in R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke .
among the applicants are 13 families with small children and two older people .
on Wednesday morning there were still 40 refugees there .
practically no one has a view to get asylum in Hungary .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to Hungarian opinion , Serbia is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; secure third country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the rejected asylum seek@@ ers shall be de@@ ported there .
only a few hundred refugees gathered in front of the &quot; transit zone &quot; in R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke .
workers began to clean up in R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke .
they collected the garbage that tens of thousands of people had left the road@@ side in the last weeks .
barrier gri@@ lles were broken down and one of the recording stores at the border was rebuilt .
nobody wanted to comment on the aim of this reconstruction .
after the closure of the border between Serbia and Hungary , Austria only reaches a few refugees .
the country has also strengthened its border controls .
but around 20,000 migrants still remained in the country by government information .
in Salzburg , about 1400 people are waiting for the journey to Germany .
the train traffic from there to Germany was stopped in the morning by the instructions of German authorities .
in Frei@@ las@@ sing regularly smaller groups of refugees arrived on foot .
mayor ro@@ de &quot; str@@ and@@ ete &quot; across the border
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we were occupied by the Brück@@ en@@ fest on Sunday with the clearing , when suddenly ten people stood at the entrance of the tent , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said W@@ ern@@ st@@ eins Mayor Alo@@ is Stad@@ ler . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
tourists , they wanted to train to Passa@@ u .
because Germany had surprisingly closed the railway traffic with Austria on Sunday because of the refugee flow in Austria , Stad@@ ler , who immediately offered his help and drew the frames along with two other hel@@ pers and their cars across the border into Nah@@ e Passa@@ u .
before we left the un@@ expect@@ ant guests only once , with snack and drinks .
we said the same , we bring them to Passa@@ u by car .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was a matter of course for us , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Stad@@ ler in the O@@ Ö@@ N interview . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they were very grateful .
a man did not let him take a generous donation - 100 Euro for the fire bri@@ g@@ ade .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this has been very happy to us , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Stad@@ ler . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on Sunday evening in W@@ els the str@@ anded train passengers had switched from an ICE train to a regional train in direction Passa@@ u . after the short notice , the railway traffic to Germany was stopped , but still trying to cross the border .
but the regional train was shut off at the border in W@@ ern@@ stein am Inn .
in W@@ ern@@ stein , the cross border is generally high in the course .
the Brück@@ en@@ fest association with the Bavarian neighbours on Sunday soci@@ ably , in the day before a two @-@ brid@@ le run sporty - organized by the Union W@@ ern@@ stein and Bavaria from Neu@@ kirchen .
the fact that Viktor Or@@ b@@ án sends thousands of thousands to us now is a logical result of hypo@@ critical politics :
instead of helping to establish structures in the R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke camp immediately in the establishment of structures , our German Chancellor has publicly tra@@ cked up the position of the Hungarian government in the m@@ ist circle of National Socialism .
the leaders of this policy are not only those Austri@@ ans who are now confronted with cha@@ otic conditions in the border regions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the refugees will also have to find that the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; praised land &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that she has invited and welcomed is nothing but another refugee camp . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it will be a great challenge , in view of the ongoing refugee streams and the approaching winter , to create decent conditions for protection @-@ seek@@ ers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and there will be an even greater peace , security and stability in Austria . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Konrad in search of 35@@ ,000 winter @-@ proof quarters
Konrad has all hands to do with the provision of refugees .
Christian Konrad is used to the fact that his word has weight .
the government has used the former mighty Rai@@ ff@@ eisen ban@@ ker to place quarters for the thousands of refugees .
the chaos in the first tak@@ eover center Tra@@ is@@ kirchen has already gotten a grip on Konrad .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have no homeless people in Tra@@ is@@ kirchen , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he told his first success . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the 20,000 refugees who came to Austria on Monday were also without a great vor@@ tex , said Konrad , and praised the organizational &quot; master performance . &quot;
on the other hand , the Ministry of the Interior spoke of a &quot; crisis @-@ like situation . &quot;
in total , Konrad expects a demand of 8@@ 5.000 quarters in the he@@ ur@@ ish year .
in order to meet the number , 35@@ ,000 establishments have to be found in the next few weeks - 20.000 countries should provide , 15,000 of the federal government .
if there are more refugees , we can create it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but there is no drum without soil , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Konrad said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he has already held talks with the provincial leaders .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they would have assured him to create quarters for the coming refugees too . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s good in Upper Austria , &quot; said Fer@@ ry Ma@@ ier .
the former VP @-@ Mand@@ at@@ ary supports Konrad .
tomorrow will be a meeting with Cardinal Christoph Schön@@ born who will be clari@@ fied as the Church will help .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; great expectations of the asylum @-@ ordin@@ ator are also in the ORF action &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hel@@ ping as we &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the platform private individuals can easily offer accommodations .
in addition , one hopes for hotels that are empty in the winter .
yesterday Konrad and Ma@@ ier critici@@ zed the standards for placing as &quot; very high . &quot;
in times of emergency it could not be that arti@@ fici@@ aries have to comply with a certain amount of the towel bars or the size of the duties .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for a temporary period , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; emergency standards &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; would have to apply . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Konrad , with his experience , founded that he was successful in contrast to the Interior Ministry when he was accommod@@ ated .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am an older gent@@ leman , whom one does not say without any further into the face of un@@ truth . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
persu@@ asi@@ veness is his most important weapon .
Konrad and Ma@@ ier do not cause the Republic to cost as they themselves declared .
they want to increase their number of employees on three to four .
so far , my own quest for debt has not been successful yet .
Konrad wanted to set up a container at the Stephan@@ splatz as an office .
but there are obviously problems with hom@@ olog@@ ation .
Linz calls for a better distribution
for the time being , no opening of urban sports halls and other buildings such as Tips @-@ Arena and Design Center for the placing of refugees is planning the city of Linz .
this is not necessary at the moment , as the persons concerned cannot be accommod@@ ated without these measures , says mayor Klaus Lu@@ ger ( SP ) .
for an emergency , however , further sites are to be tested for their suitability .
criticism exercised by the city chief on the division of the refugees within the federal state .
other districts also need to make their contribution here .
Seeh@@ of@@ er : &quot; borders are not sealed &quot;
in a longer telephone call with the Bavarian Prime Minister Horst Seeh@@ of@@ er ( CS@@ U ) , Landes@@ haupt@@ mann Josef P@@ ühr@@ inger ( VP ) announced further action in the refugee issue on Monday .
Seeh@@ of@@ er has assured me that the German borders are not sealed .
the further journey of refugees to the Federal Republic is still possible .
however , there are now the corresponding border controls .
there will be no more special trains with refugees to Germany for the time being .
the guards , however , would be brought to Germany with regular trains .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from the other EU member states , P@@ ühr@@ inger once again demanded greater solidarity in the refugee issue . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the fact that Austria is again introducing controls at its borders is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a logical consequence &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from the action of the Germans . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the next Run@@ t@@ astic is a Mat@@ ter of Time
the general refur@@ bish@@ ment of the &quot; Neue Wer@@ ft &quot; in the Linz industry line has been officially completed .
in four of the six floors of the office and production building , the publicly listed IT Group S &amp; T has moved , the rest ( 27@@ 00 square meters ) is to be le@@ ased to young , innovative companies from the technology sector .
&quot; in IT , smart minds are our raw material - and we must try to work for us , &quot; says S &amp; D CEO Hannes Nieder@@ haus@@ er .
he could imagine investing in the startup companies of the new shi@@ py@@ ard and later also to acquire some of them .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from the very beginning S &amp; T wants to cooperate with the new neighbors , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the next Run@@ t@@ astic is just a matter of time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Euro 1.7 million was invested by S &amp; T , 3.3 million euros from Tech@@ Center , which is one third of the city of Linz , the land of Upper Austria and the Bund ( FF@@ G ) .
the building is le@@ ased from Linz AG for 60 years at S &amp; T as well as Tech@@ Center .
30 percent of the 27@@ 00 square metres remaining space in the building are already rented , for another 40 percent there are requests .
Li@@ a @-@ Per@@ oni @-@ In@@ hab@@ erin opened second business in the arcade
the new shop focuses on Fur@@ la hand@@ bags .
actually J@@ utta Br@@ eit wanted to get a dog .
this project had to push the 49 year old owner of Li@@ a Per@@ oni in the do@@ ve market in the twi@@ light : finally , she has got an increase in the form of another business location .
in the Fur@@ la @-@ Shop opposite the shop , where it sells among other things bags , suit@@ cases , shoes and garments from various manufacturers , everything about women &apos;s hand@@ bags of the brand Fur@@ la , wall@@ ets are starting from 75 Euro .
larger bags and accessories cost up to 500 euros .
the new shop has been in operation since yesterday .
it was rebuilt several weeks ago .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I have long considered whether I should open a shop , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Br@@ eit . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the deciding factor for the decision was , among other things , that the Fur@@ la producers , who are at home in Bologna , were impressed by the idea of an own site where only their hand@@ bags were sold .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are the only ones in Greater Linz that sell this brand , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the mother of two daughters , who even has Italian roots . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
her fashion interest has been placed in the cra@@ dle from her mother .
I am most happy when something develops and I can show new trends at affordable prices .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why some women are in rap@@ ture at the sight of a beautiful hand@@ bag , the professional woman can &apos;t answer with last security . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
perhaps it is due to the fact that a beautiful bag is used for every outfit .

Donald Tr@@ ump ( 69 ) is always good for up@@ sets .
whether he expresses foreign affairs , concerns journalists or reveals knowledge gaps in international crisis politics - the candidate for the US presidential office ki@@ cks up the election campaign vigor@@ ously .
and cut off well .
this is also recorded in the Pal@@ at@@ inate K@@ all@@ stadt , where the grand@@ parents of the real estate million@@ aire come from .
the New Yorker with the F@@ öhn@@ fres@@ ur is a concept for many in the win@@ eg@@ rowing village on the wine route .
some in the 1200 @-@ inhabit@@ ant village is related to him over -@@ zig corners .
his grandfather came from K@@ all@@ stadt in the Pal@@ at@@ inate : Donald Tr@@ ump , here in campaign mode .
the K@@ all@@ städ@@ ter Sim@@ one Wen@@ del turned a film about Tr@@ ump .
and what do the vill@@ agers think about his goal to become the most powerful man in the world ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think they find it somehow exciting , but they are not so deeply impressed in their K@@ all@@ stadt manner , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Sim@@ one Wen@@ del . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the native K@@ all@@ städ@@ ter has shot an am@@ using documentary about the place and his famous children , including Tr@@ ump as well as the K@@ et@@ ch@@ up family Heinz .
Tr@@ ump , who is not known for hum@@ ility , comes in &quot; Kings of K@@ all@@ stadt &quot; ( 2014 ) - so with the statement that he would certainly be successful if he would live in K@@ all@@ stadt .
he did not bring it to the king of the hearts .
although there is no respect for the performance of the family , but also the opinion that Tr@@ ump is a bit a big mouth , &quot; Wen@@ del says .
coinci@@ dentally , the nick@@ name , the K@@ all@@ stadt in the vicinity , was &quot; The Br@@ ull@@ j@@ es@@ macher &quot; - in High German : the investors , they say .
so Tr@@ ump comes from the village of the An@@ ders .
the Tr@@ ump &apos;s success story began in 18@@ 85 when the later grandfather emig@@ rated and opened a restaurant for gold dig@@ gers in the USA .
the foundation stone of the real estate company was first real estate purchases in New York .
but the life of the grand@@ parents was not free from tragedy : their desire to return to home in the long run failed in the Bavarian state to which the Pfalz belonged .
he did not record Tr@@ ump because he was once without permission , the director of the Institute for Pal@@ at@@ inate History and Volk@@ sk@@ unde , Roland Paul , declared the film start .
Tr@@ ump is the grand@@ son of an illegal immig@@ rant .
this contrasts with the sometimes distinctive statements of the descend@@ ant .
he had repeatedly talked about Mexican immigrants in the United States and demanded the construction of a boundary wall to frigh@@ ten illegal immigrants .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not so li@@ ke@@ able , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Hans @-@ Joachim Ben@@ der , a distant relative Tr@@ um@@ ps ( &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Grand@@ ma was a born tr@@ ump , the grand@@ pa was born Heinz &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the win@@ emaker in retirement looks rather dist@@ ancing the Americans , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is always so &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
does he think Tr@@ ump arrives ?
&quot; I can &apos;t imagine this , &quot; says the 72 @-@ year @-@ old .
&quot; he never cared about K@@ all@@ stadt . &quot;
the Pen@@ sion@@ wirt Ver@@ oni@@ ka Sch@@ ra@@ mm men@@ tions like some K@@ all@@ stad@@ ters that a descend@@ ant of the Heinz family donated something for the church organ during a visit , which is generally well anch@@ ored .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I can &apos;t imagine this by the Donald , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the 68 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they find it better if he didn &apos;t win the election , because &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he has such radical views , I don &apos;t know if that &apos;s good . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if those who had the sa@@ wing at the time of his grandfather in the US would have been like him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he would never have arrived there . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are more interesting themes than him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Win@@ zer@@ to@@ chter Sarah Büh@@ ler . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and as president ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my President is not , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the grapes are also ripe without the president Tr@@ ump . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Wend@@ els Film , for which Tr@@ ump has been inter@@ viewed for a long time , have seen 12@@ ,000 children &apos;s go@@ ers , even in the US a@@ woke the interest .
the Upper Bavarian community Ram@@ sau with Ber@@ cht@@ es@@ ga@@ den is Germany &apos;s first mountain@@ eering village .
in the Ber@@ cht@@ es@@ ga@@ den National Park , the 1800 inhabitants of the Ber@@ cht@@ es@@ ga@@ den National Park received the award for gentle tourism in the Ber@@ cht@@ es@@ ga@@ den National Park on Wednesday .
in Austria there are already 20 &quot; mountain clim@@ bers . &quot;
in the neighbouring country , the local Alpine Club is responsible for awar@@ ding the award .
a &quot; mountain climbing village &quot; may have a maximum of 2500 inhabitants .
at least one fifth of its surface must be designated as a protected area .
seven &apos;s Sunrise domin@@ ates the reviews , despite attempts by N@@ ine to take over the loss of leadership in the Today Show
Karl Stef@@ an@@ ovic and Lisa Wil@@ kin@@ son rush to Can@@ ber@@ ra to report to the loss of the leadership of the liber@@ als , but there has been no major shifts in the reviews for today .
the N@@ ine &apos;s breakfast show was broadcast by the federal capital , when Mal@@ col@@ m Turn@@ bull made the fall of Tony Ab@@ bot@@ t .
the Ri@@ val Sunrise , with the moder@@ ators David Koch and Sam@@ anth@@ a Ar@@ my@@ tage , was part of a one @-@ week series of international TV shows , including Dubai , New York , Niag@@ ara Falls and Can@@ cu@@ n .
this down@@ side of the distance seemed to play no role for Australian TV viewers because sunrise achieved an average of 39@@ 7@@ ,000 spectators in the five capitals , compared with Today 33@@ 9@@ ,000 .
today , Today recorded a slight increase compared to the ratings for Monday ( 3@@ 17@@ ,000 ) and last Tuesday ( 28@@ 3,000 ) , but its number remained behind the last Thursday ( 34@@ 3,000 ) .
in recent months Today , Today , closed the gap to Sunrise .
in August Today , an average of 3@@ 18@@ ,000 arrived in comparison to the 33@@ 0,000 of Sunrise .
at the beginning of the year the distance was between 40,000 and 50.000 .
until now in September , Sunrise has an average of 34@@ 9@@ ,000 spectators at 3@@ 14.@@ 000 at Today .
this is the most interesting thing that happens every morning .
the winds of change affect these morning men more than the Parliament !
Karl and Lisa are fine , thank you for the review !

the great news for Seven was the impressive debut of 800 words with the former Pack@@ ed to the Raf@@ ters Erik Thom@@ son series .
the new drama about a recently weather@@ ed father who decides to settle with his two children on New Zealand &apos;s coast reached a very impressive figure of 1.@@ 2@@ 19 million viewers .
critics asked if Thom@@ son could wear a hit show solo without the ra@@ fting star Rebecca Gib@@ ney .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the result of yesterday evening responded with a clear &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Yes &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the X @-@ Factor of Seven stayed strongly with 1.@@ 136 million viewers and easily hit The Block ( 8@@ 3@@ 8.000 ) and T@@ BL family ( 7@@ 26@@ ,000 ) .
seven had mixed results in evening two of The Ch@@ ase Australia .
the first half hour ( 17 : 00 to 17 : 30 ) is the new quiz show , moder@@ ated by Andrew O &apos;@@ Ke@@ ef@@ e on average 44@@ ,000 spectators .
the second half hour ( 17 : 30 to 18 : 00 ) j@@ umped to 6@@ 23@@ ,000 spectators - enough for a small victory over Ed@@ die Mc@@ Gu@@ ires Hot @-@ Se@@ at ( 6@@ 13@@ ,000 ) .
on Monday evening , the first half hour of The Ch@@ ase Australia scored 5@@ 20,000 spectators and in the second half an hour was 7@@ 20,000 .
hot @-@ Se@@ at an average of 6@@ 20,000 .
the decline in the quot@@ as of the second evening of The Ch@@ ase Australia will make N@@ ine confident that hot seed will ultimately prevail at 17 : 30 .
the Ch@@ ase Australia is a replacement for a million dollars that failed to over@@ lap the Mc@@ Gu@@ ires show .

the last three agree : Bachelor &apos;s Sam Wood is the perfect man - but who will he choose ?
secret revealed ? ...
L@@ ana Je@@ wel@@ ons Fel@@ lows , Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay and S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana Mark@@ os@@ ki probably have un@@ wit@@ t@@ ingly revealed who the Bachelor wins .
the woman , at which Sam Wood eventually lands in The Bachelor , was wrapped in the greatest sec@@ rec@@ y .
and none of the three remaining girls will certainly not reveal whether she is the one who received the last rose .
but when we checked out with Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay , S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana Mark@@ os@@ ki and L@@ ana Je@@ av@@ on Fel@@ lows on the day before being made up of three two , you may have accidentally added a hint of who will be the winner .
Sam Wood has sealed his lips until the final on Thursday
all three women have expressed themselves in a ly@@ rical manner why Wood is the perfect man and called his sense of hum@@ our , ambition , family values and positive attitude as reasons why they would like to be his partner .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but if the question is asked , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; If you don &apos;t , who should get W@@ oods last rose ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; could their answers to the game per@@ tain@@ er who won the heart of the Bach@@ el@@ ors . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
everyone named Je@@ av@@ on Fel@@ lows and Mark@@ os@@ ki both quickly - apart from themselves - M@@ ack@@ ay as the best partner for Wood .
Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay and Sam Wood have had a simple relationship from the first day .
&quot; from the moment I went to the house and noticed ( Sarah &apos;s ) and Sam@@ s energies , I felt that they were quite compatible , and I thought that throughout the course of the show , &quot; said Je@@ av@@ ons Fel@@ lows .
&quot; Sarah stands on the ground with both feet , making it so much fun to be with her , &quot; Mark@@ os@@ ki added .
I have seen them together and they have the right chemistry .
they feel comfortable and comfortable with each other .
Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay believes that she and Sam Wood are well suited as a couple .
from her point of view , M@@ ack@@ ay said that the house visit last week made her clear that Wood was &quot; the One . &quot;
&quot; as soon as I saw him with my friends and family , it became clear to me that this is obviously not just a game - I am now set un@@ condition@@ ally to him , &quot; she said .
and when she was asked whom Wood should choose , if not she , she was en@@ ig@@ matic .
&quot; I don &apos;t know if I can say it , &quot; she said .
I love the remaining girls equally - it &apos;s a tie between S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana and L@@ ana .
the bach@@ elor will be broad@@ cast@@ ed on ten on Wednesday , 19 : 30 .
originally released as Sarah &apos;s first choice for Sam Wood ?
Jar@@ ry@@ d Hay@@ ne had several options to start his N@@ FL career .
Detroit and Seattle showed great interest after his move to the USA - and there were many other teams who sent requests after his impressive open training day at the end of last year .
but Hay@@ ne chose the San Francisco 49@@ ers and Trainer Jim Tom@@ sul@@ a and it looks like a wise decision .
some trainers would have banned Hay@@ ne for the rest of the game on the bank when he lost a don@@ or as the Aus@@ sie Ru@@ g@@ by League converter did on Tuesday at 20 @-@ 3 victory against Minn@@ es@@ ota on Tuesday .
but Tom@@ sul@@ a trusted his husband and gave Hay@@ ne the next opportunity for a punch @-@ return and also in the running game after a violation of Reg@@ gie Bush .
Tom@@ sul@@ a continued to show his true face in the locker room after the game .
instead of grinding his ro@@ ok@@ ies before the rest of the team through the mill , he encouraged them .
Tom@@ br@@ a also publi@@ ci@@ zed Hay@@ ne in his press conference after the game .
the 49@@ ers Spor@@ tre@@ por@@ ter Cam In@@ man reported that Hay@@ ne was also encouraged by special team coordinator Thomas Mc@@ Gau@@ gh@@ ey who advised him to forget his scrat@@ ched catch and take care of the next game .
Jar@@ ry@@ d Hay@@ ne p@@ atz@@ t with a pun@@ t , which was restored in the first game quarter of Minn@@ es@@ ota Vi@@ kings
it was certainly not the start that Hay@@ ne and his massive Australian followers had hoped for his N@@ FL debut .
Hay@@ ne left the playing field after the f@@ um@@ ble and later told the Australian Radio Duo Ham@@ ish &amp; Andy on 2@@ Day@@ FM 10@@ 4.1 that he couldn &apos;t imagine a worse start into his N@@ FL career ,
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was a thing that happens now , you just take care of the next game , and that &apos;s it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hay@@ ne said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Hay@@ ne compared the Schn@@ itzer with his Orig@@ in debut back then in 2007 when a passport with his own in @-@ Go@@ al area led to a T@@ ry for Que@@ ens@@ land .
overall , it was nevertheless a great experience for the 27 @-@ year @-@ old .

free voters demand the setting of 1,000 new teachers in Bavaria because of the high number of refugees .
party and group leader Hubert Ai@@ wan@@ ger warned at the beginning of the F@@ W autumn sage in Groß@@ wall@@ stadt before a severe crisis in Bavaria &apos;s schools , if there are not correspon@@ dingly new teachers for the many new students : &quot; we need at least 1000 additional teachers to protect schools from collapse , &quot; said Ai@@ wan@@ ger .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; otherwise we will get the Bavarian education system . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the open @-@ air parliamentary fraction meets Friday in the Fran@@ con@@ ian Commun@@ e .
in fact , quite different main themes were planned .
but the record number of refugees is now dominated by the Free voters &apos; meeting .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course , the subject of asylum will survive the retreat , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ai@@ wan@@ ger . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
ai@@ wan@@ ger called for the establishment of UN protection zones for refugees in Syria , as did during the Yugosla@@ v War in the n@@ ine@@ ties .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so it &apos;s not going on , we have to go to the causes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Free voters boss . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
rejected asylum seek@@ ers want to post@@ p@@ one Free voters as soon as possible .
for this reason , Ai@@ wan@@ ger also demanded more personnel for the administration courts responsible for asylum requests : &quot; we also need at least 50 new asylum seek@@ ers , &quot; Ai@@ wan@@ ger said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the F@@ W boss critic@@ ised that several federal states are not consistent : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need federal standards of federal states throughout Germany . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; Bavaria is postpon@@ ing , others are not . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we must become more responsive . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the state policy in Groß@@ wall@@ stadt is not to fall under the table .
a long @-@ standing perpet@@ ual torch remains on the agenda : the educational policy .
for the new school year , the Minister of Culture Ludwig Spa@@ en@@ le ( CS@@ U ) started the pilot study &quot; Mittel@@ stufe plus &quot; at 47 grammar schools in which an extension of the secondary school of three to four years is tested .
but Ai@@ wan@@ ger is not far enough .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the issue of G@@ 9 must be accelerated , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the F@@ W boss . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we call for freedom of choice for all secondary schools who want this . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
free travel at G@@ 9 wherever it is desired .
fir@@ mer Wall Street helps D@@ ax to jump on the jumps
the German stock market has closed with profits over long stretches of directional and nervous trade history .
only in the afternoon was a fir@@ mer start to the US stock exchanges for a clear direction , which ultimately promoted the D@@ ax by 0.@@ 56 percent to 10 18@@ 8.@@ 13 points upward .
the M@@ DA@@ X medium @-@ sized values gained 0.@@ 54 percent to 19 55@@ 2,@@ 88 points .

solid profits also comp@@ eted in London and Paris .
in the US , the D@@ ow Jones Index ranked around 1 percent in Plus .
many stock markets expect markets to be replaced by the markets up to the interest rate decision in the US and the large decline on the fut@@ ures exchanges this Friday .
the debate about the burdens of nuclear ph@@ asing has meanwhile pushed the shares of RW@@ E to a record low and left deep traces on E@@ on .
according to &quot; Spiegel , &quot; German energy companies may be missing 30 billion euros in provisions .
the federal government denied the figures mentioned in the press .
as a result , the shares of the two largest German energy companies recovered slightly but ultimately lost 3.3 per cent ( RW@@ E ) and 6.@@ 15 percent ( E@@ on ) .
Infin@@ eon shares increased by a further 3.3 percent at the D@@ ax summit .
according to a dealer , a positive report from the US investor magazine &quot; Bar@@ ron &apos;s &quot; had a positive effect on the weekend .
accordingly , investors made little attention to the German chip@@ maker .
investments in promising wafer technologies and the focus on the car market should be paid .
car values were in demand : even in the traditionally weak summer month of August more cars were sold than in the same period of the previous year , as the AC@@ EA trade association announced the launch of the International Motor Show IAA in Frankfurt .
the papers from the Daimler and BMW car manufacturers increased by 1.@@ 34 percent and 2.@@ 21 percent respectively .
Volkswagen virtu@@ es increased by 1.@@ 26 percent .

4 people killed after police shoot rubber bul@@ lets on demonstr@@ ators in Nepal
four people , including a 4 @-@ year @-@ old boy , were killed in Southern Nepal after the police fired rubber bul@@ lets into a crowd that demonstrated against the proposed new constitution , a civil servant said on Wednesday .
the violence broke out on Tuesday evening in the district of Rup@@ pers@@ deh@@ i , about 175 miles west of the capital Kath@@ mand@@ u .
B@@ ish@@ n@@ u Pr@@ as@@ ad D@@ ha@@ kal , Chief Ac@@ coun@@ s@@ ellor , said that more than 1,000 demonstr@@ ators had gathered outside a police station , throwing some of you stones and fire@@ bombs .
Mr D@@ ha@@ kal said that the police have used tear gas and then shot in the air before res@@ or@@ ting to rubber bul@@ lets .
20 polic@@ emen and five civilians were injured , he said .
it was not immediately clear why the rubber bul@@ lets used , which are known to be able to kill , which are traditionally used as a less le@@ thal alternative , apparently produced such a high death rate .
the debate was the last in weeks of violent protests in Nepal &apos;s southern plains , where members of the ethnic group of the Mad@@ rec@@ i say that new provinces being formed within the proposed new constitution would reduce their political influence .
there were also protests in Western Nepal from the ethnic group of the Th@@ arus who want to have their own state .
at least 40 people , including 11 police officers , were in violent clas@@ hes since the 10th .
August killed when the four major political parties signed an agreement to divide the country into provinces - an important step towards a new constitution , but a very controversial subject in Nepal , which has been ruled central for centuries .
working on a new constitution has been on its way since 2008 , but the law@@ makers accelerated the process after the devastating earthquake that killed thousands of people in April .
the legislation adopted this week on certain cl@@ auses in the draft constitution in Kath@@ mand@@ u , and officials said that the new constitution could enter into force on Sunday .
construction site planned in the city
the property at the Em@@ den Youth Centre Alte Post shall be restored .
the city is currently preparing everything for the marketing of the 4000 square meter area .
a mixture of trade , commerce and housing is planned - but there are no concrete offers yet .
Em@@ den - The city of Em@@ den wants to market an approximately 4000 square metre plot in direct vicinity to the youth centre Alte Post .
the preparations for this are currently underway .
the plan is to use the premises for a mix of trade , commerce and housing .
waiting for appropriate offers , it is said by the city .
which investor would come into question is not yet clear .
accordingly , no contracts were concluded .
the city of Em@@ den had a part of the land , which is located at the ring road / corner of the Great Street , already a few months ago and had the building demoli@@ shed .
project H@@ ieve : details are on the table
the plans for the holiday settlement at the Small Sea near Em@@ den take shape .
the investor made public plans for the project for the first time .
some An@@ li@@ eger are still worried - they fear the selling of their leisure time
for months , behind closed doors was negotiated , sc@@ ared , deb@@ ated and drawn .
the plans for a new holiday resort on the Little Sea are now close to Em@@ den on the table .
the interest , the medium @-@ sized em@@ blem of the company &quot; System @-@ Bau , &quot; presented his plans for the first time in the city development committee of the Em@@ den Council on Monday evening .
originally this point had been on the non @-@ public part of the agenda .
under the pressure of the project critic and the F@@ DP faction , which accused the investors and the administration of sec@@ rec@@ y , Ralf Be@@ hr@@ inger went on the offensive by the system construction management : &quot; we have not yet responded to all questions , &quot; he said before the Council members and more than 50 visitors .
but it is good to be able to meet all the rum@@ ors now .
the project has been around ten to twelve million euros for months in the discussion .
violent reactions under sea @-@ bu@@ ster owners who had come to the meeting called the pictures and new details about the desired hotel building .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Roberto Schulz , the owner of the sea and a member of the Executive Board at the advoc@@ acy of the An@@ li@@ eger , Pro H@@ ieve , compl@@ ains : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a giant cla@@ p that over@@ looks all the other buildings . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , he fears like a number of other project critics that the traffic would increase sharply due to the intended size of the system : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there must be whole bus dischar@@ ges so that it pays off , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Schulz . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , what is happening exactly on the well @-@ planted area of the former inn is still open .
there is no operator yet .

Google launches dou@@ bling donations campaign to collect $ 11 million for refugees
Google Inc ( Goo@@ gle@@ . O ) announced a dou@@ bling @-@ donation campaign to raise $ 11 million for humanitarian organizations that will help thousands of refugees who have over@@ run the European nations , as they flee from war torn and im@@ pover@@ ished countries .
Google has an un@@ usually personal approach to announc@@ ing the donations call on his blog .
instead of giving a manager the announcement , Rita Mas@@ oud , a Google employee who fled with her family from Kab@@ ul when she was seven years old , wrote about her personal experiences .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our trip included many dark railway and bus journeys , as well as hunger , thirst , cold and fear , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I was lucky .
but since the refugee and migrant crisis has grown in Europe , many people like my family are desper@@ ately looking for help .
donations go to four non @-@ profit organizations that provide assistance to refugees and migrants : doctors without borders , International Res@@ cue Committee , Save the Children and UN High Commissioner for Refu@@ ge@@ es .
Google said that the first globally collected donations up to a value of 5.5 million on goo@@ gle@@ .com / could be doubled to $ 11 million .
Europe is facing its worst refugee crisis since the Second World War , largely caused by the four @-@ year civil war in Syria , which has driven more than 4 million people this year .
many also flee from war @-@ torn Afghanistan , Yemen , Iraq and Libya .
reporting of Y@@ as@@ me@@ en Ab@@ ut@@ al@@ eb ; processing by Christian Pl@@ umb
for slightly overweight diab@@ e@@ tics , weight loss surgery may be helpful .
the advantages of weight loss surgery for obes@@ e people with type 2 diabetes may last for at least five years after a new study .
it is still too early to say if slightly overweight people with diabetes after weight loss surgery live longer than those who receive non @-@ surgical treatments .
&quot; the mortality data need a long time to show something , &quot; said Dr. Robin Black@@ stone , an expert in weight loss surgery , who wrote an editorial to the new study in J@@ AM@@ A Surgery .
weight loss surgery or obesity surgery , use different methods to reduce the size of the stomach .
they reduce hunger and limit the body &apos;s ability to absorb food .
over the years , obesity operations have proven to be effective in the treatment of type 2 diabetes , but most of the studies have been carried out in people who are obes@@ e with a Body Mass Index ( BM@@ I ) of 35 or higher .
BM@@ I , a certain amount of weight regarding size , is considered normal between 18@@ ,5 and 24.@@ 9 .
a BM@@ I of 25 or more indicates that someone is overweight and people with a BM@@ I above 30 are considered obes@@ e .
you can calculate your BM@@ I here : 1.@@ us@@ a.@@ go@@ v / 1@@ D@@ 0@@ Z@@ q@@ D@@ v .
for the new study , the researchers from Tai@@ w@@ ans Min @-@ Sh@@ eng General Hospital used data that they have collected in a study since 2007 and compare two types of obesity surgery - ga@@ stri@@ c b@@ ypass and ga@@ stri@@ c catar@@ act - for medical treatments for type 2 diabetes for people who were slightly overweight .
the average BM@@ I among those undergoing this operation decreased from 31 to 24.@@ 5 to the end of the fifth year in this study .
meanwhile , the BM@@ I was with those who received non @-@ surgical diabetes treatments approximately at 29 .
among those undergoing a surgical procedure , 36 % of the diabetes condition resolved completely and at 28 % in part .
in the medi@@ cally treated group , diabetes was completely dissolved in only one percent and in some cases only about two percent .
in addition , the results of the controls of blood pressure , tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ des and &quot; bad &quot; LD@@ L cholesterol were generally better in the &quot; surgical &quot; group , &quot; the authors found out .
the researchers also monitored hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c blood glucose levels reflecting the blood sugar levels over time .
hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c is best kept below 7 percent , the researchers write .
after surgery , the average hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c decreased from around 9 percent to around 6 percent .
however , it remained stable at about 8 percent in the medical therapy group .
but this better gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic control - as reflected in the improved hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c level - did not dimin@@ ish mortality in five years , says leading researcher Dr. Chi@@ h @-@ Ch@@ eng H@@ su and his colleagues .
the research team also compared the average results for the two types of surgery .
in the fifth year , the b@@ ypass surgery group lost more weight compared to the guest rec@@ tomy group ( 18.@@ 7 vs. 14.@@ 2 kg ) , reaching greater rec@@ esses in BM@@ I ( 7.@@ 4 vs. 5.1 ) and hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c ( 3.1 % vs. 2.1 % ) and recorded a complete overcoming of diabetes ( 4@@ 6.@@ 9 % vs. 16.@@ 7 % ) .
while the new study shows no survival benefit of the surgery after five years , there are evidence from a study of heavy people in Sweden that surgery leads to a longer life , says Black@@ stone from the University of Arizona , College of Medicine Phoenix .
in the Swedish study , it was with obes@@ e people who underwent an obesity operation , about 29 percent less likely to die over the course of 15 years - compared to a group that tried conventional methods .
although the new study showed no benefit for survival in the surgery patient , Black@@ stone said it was cal@@ ming for people with a BM@@ I of 35 who are interested in the procedure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the critical point of this study because it says that this operation is lower in this lower BM@@ I group , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; without increased risk of death or kidney disease , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Black@@ stone added that people and their doctors should start taking weight seriously as soon as the patient lies with his BM@@ I between 27 and 30 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think we wait too long for people to take this seriously , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think that once they have accumulated these genetic changes that have soli@@ di@@ fied their bodies with obesity and diabetes , a revers@@ al is really difficult . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; it is impossible that everyone can come to Europe &quot; - Dalai Lama - RT @-@ News
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Europe cannot accept all refugees , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Dalai Lama said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the real solution of the refugee crisis in the Middle East . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Tibetan Buddhist guide urged him to stop violence in the refugees &apos; home countries .
the Dalai Lama spoke to the problem of the ongoing refugee crisis at the beginning of his ten @-@ day visit to the UK in his speech on the occasion of the opening of the Dalai Lama Centre for Com@@ passion in Oxford that dedic@@ ates himself to ethics studies .
he demanded that under the given circumstances the interests of humanity should be placed before the interests of the individual nations or even continents .
he also stressed that the reaction of Western European countries to the refugee crisis is ad@@ mira@@ ble , but the situation is not appropriate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is impossible that everyone can come to Europe , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in his speech . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
even though the Dalai Lama praised Germany and Austria &apos;s efforts to cope with the crisis , he stressed that it was only a temporary solution .
&quot; taking care of several thousand refugees is wonderful , but in the meantime , you need to think about long @-@ term solutions , such as true peace and genuine development , mainly through education , for these Muslim countries , &quot; he stressed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the end , we need to think about how the killing is reduced in their countries . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we must reduce the use of violence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the use of violence has never solved these problems , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he added . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Dalai Lama spoke the problem of violence and also commented George Bush &apos;s action after the terrorist attack of September 11 , and turned out that the violent reaction of the US moved a chain of un@@ controll@@ able events .
after September 11 , I expressed my con@@ dol@@ ences in a letter to President Bush , and I told him the way to solve this problem lies in non @-@ violence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I know his motives were good , but he put violence and this caused unexpected consequences , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Dalai Lama . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
four@@ fold increase of intake of hand disinf@@ ect@@ ant by children in the last 4 years
poison control centres in the US report about an almost 400 percent increase in the number of children under 12 years of age who swal@@ low strong alcoholic hand des@@ infection , such as Georgia &apos;s Po@@ ison Center .
according to Dr. Gay@@ lord Lop@@ ez , Director of Georgia Po@@ ison Center , the cases of revenue of hand des@@ infection products in children under 12 years of age reported the poison control centres reported from 3,@@ 26@@ 6 in 2010 to 16.@@ 117 in 2014 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; children are increasingly coming to these products , and unfortunately a percentage of them land in the emergency room , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Lop@@ ez CN@@ N . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he said that some children pur@@ pos@@ efully drink disinf@@ ect@@ ants while some do it to impress their friends or because of a mut@@ ation in the social media .
YouTube videos show how young people drink disinf@@ ect@@ ants only because of a cheap experience .
adolescents are said to have mixed disinf@@ ect@@ ants with alcohol containing mou@@ th@@ wash to obtain a harder drink .
younger children can be attracted by attractive fragrances of the disinf@@ ect@@ ant .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a child does not think that this is bad for it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Lop@@ ez . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
many of the most attractive ( hand @-@ dis@@ infection products ) are those that are perf@@ um@@ ed .
there are disinf@@ ect@@ ants with straw@@ berry , grape and orange scent , which are very appealing to children .
hand disinf@@ ect@@ ants contain somewhere between 45 and 95 percent alcohol .
especially in infants , a few sp@@ lashes can lead to alcohol intoxic@@ ation .
&quot; it is highly concentrated alcohol , &quot; said Dr. Stephen Thor@@ n@@ ton , Medical Director of the Tox@@ ic Emergency Centre at the University of K@@ ans@@ as , the Fox 4 station in K@@ ansa City .
so , you wouldn &apos;t let any si@@ p whis@@ key around , but people leave this hand @-@ disinf@@ ect@@ ant within reach of children , and when children come to it , then it is a quick way to consume lots of alcohol .
N@@ ha@@ i@@ jah Rus@@ sell , a six year old girl , who recently took four sy@@ ring@@ es of after straw@@ berry fra@@ grant drugs in the school , was brought to an emergency room .
her blood alcohol concentration was 17@@ 9 , twice higher than the threshold , which is considered drunk by an adult , said Dr. Chris Rit@@ ch@@ ey , an emergency doctor who treated her in the G@@ winn@@ ett Medical Center outside Atlanta .
N@@ ha@@ i@@ jah l@@ all@@ ched her words and was not able to go when she arrived in the emergency room .
doctors monitored them overnight in a separate children &apos;s hospital on signs of brain trauma , as the girl had fallen by the alcohol and had pushed the head , said Rit@@ ch@@ ey .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was very frigh@@ tening , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Or@@ tori@@ a Scott , N@@ ha@@ i@@ jah &apos;s mother , CN@@ N . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it could have been fatal to my child .
Lop@@ ez has recommended parents and teachers to use non @-@ alcoholic products or dis@@ infection hand@@ ker@@ chiefs or to store hands @-@ on disinf@@ ect@@ ants outside the reach of the child .
in addition , some disinf@@ ect@@ ants were associated with deaths as a result of alcohol intoxic@@ ation .
in 2013 , two women died in Ontario after swal@@ lowing hand disinf@@ ect@@ ants which contained a toxic , non @-@ declared ingredient .
health authorities suspect that the product contained meth@@ anol , a le@@ thal solution instead of eth@@ yl alcohol , which was noted as an active ingredient .
in January , three students of the fourth class in New York were planning to poison their &quot; gem@@ s &quot; teachers by setting anti @-@ bacterial products around the classroom , &quot; reports a police report .
the teacher is highly allergic to hand disinf@@ ect@@ ant and ban@@ ished her from her room .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the police considered the promised plan as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; weighing &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and referred to disciplinary action to the school authority . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Vil@@ lingen @-@ Schwen@@ n@@ ingen : three vehicles damaged

the lack of title competition in Scottish football gets bored - de Bo@@ er
the former R@@ angers mid@@ fiel@@ der and former national player of the Netherlands Ron@@ ald de Bo@@ er said that Dutch football fans have lost interest in Cel@@ tic , there is no title ri@@ val@@ ry with the R@@ angers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; de Bo@@ er , currently an ambassador for Aj@@ ax , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Holland they show no highlights of the Cel@@ tic games and why ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is because the R@@ angers are not there .
people here talk not only about the return of the R@@ angers .
they talk about Old Fir@@ m .
they talk about both teams and that is what they are interested in .
there is a lot of excitement in the Old @-@ Fir@@ m games , and there are not only the people in Scotland who want to see these games .
I will turn things around , swe@@ ars Dei@@ la .
Ron@@ ny Dei@@ la has accepted that Cel@@ tic has to fight , but the Norwegian boss s@@ wore to turn things around .
after the defeat against Malm@@ ö and the subsequent departure from the Champions League , the defeat against 10 men from Aber@@ deen , which now has five points ahead clearly at the top of the table .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but Dei@@ la said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Cel@@ tic already had bad times before , and we will come back . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
now we want to get out as soon as possible .
I know it &apos;s very frustr@@ ating and a lot of people are very , very angry or sad about what happens .
we feel that exactly this way - but we must continue .
we really need the support of Cel@@ tic because that makes the players better .
standing together is so important .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the ex @-@ boss of Br@@ ent@@ ford said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the January @-@ transfer window is very different from the summer window . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mc@@ Inn@@ es said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is no team who has won everything , in poker games or le@@ agues , the games of this kind also won &apos;t win . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; unemployment in Scotland remains unchanged , while in the United Kingdom it is rising . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
unemployment in Scotland remained unchanged from May to July at 16@@ 4,000 , while the number of people without work for the United Kingdom increased by 10,000 to 1.@@ 82 million in the same period .
Scotland &apos;s unemployment rate of 5.@@ 9 percent was over the figure of 5.5 percent , as the figures of the Bureau for National Statistics ( ON@@ S ) showed .
meanwhile , employment in Scotland fell by 12@@ ,000 during the three months , with the number of employees now at 2,@@ 6@@ 12@@ ,000 .
in the course of the quarter the employment rate for Scotland fell to 7@@ 4.0 percent - a figure over the UK average of 7@@ 3.5 percent .
the Secretary of State for Scotland David Mund@@ ell commented on the latest figures and said , &quot; The long @-@ term plan of the government has laid the foundation for a stronger economy . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is almost exactly a year ago that Scotland has made the historic decision to remain part of the United Kingdom . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in these 12 months we have experienced further improvements in the Scottish labour market with an increase in employment and a decline in unemployment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

why I &apos;m witness@@ ing an execution in O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma
a little later , except for a late legal action , I will see how a man is brought to death .
when it happens , and I hope it doesn &apos;t happen , I will sit in an audience gallery in the death chamber at O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma State Pen@@ it@@ enti@@ ary when Richard G@@ los@@ si@@ p is executed by the po@@ ison@@ ous inj@@ ector .
he asked me to be one of the four official witnesses at his death .
the invitation was made for the first time in January about his best friend , and although I was shocked , I agreed .
when the day drew closer , I began to fear .
so why should I do it ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I agreed , because I thought it would be a good way to tell the whole story about the death penalty . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it would offer a unique perspective .
it is true that journalists are allowed to see exec@@ utions in the US , and as often more applications are available as places , a more mac@@ ab@@ re lot@@ tery takes place in order to decide who is elected .
O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma has reduced the number of media slots from 12 to five .
those who are chosen will see it emotion@@ less .
I can &apos;t do that .
I will sit next to Richard G@@ los@@ si@@ ps closest friend with whom I developed my own relationship over the months with telephone calls and a two @-@ and @-@ a @-@ half hours visit .
I like the guy .
we often laugh a lot when we speak .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the prison authorities say that I cannot be a witness and a journalist , so it will not be allowed me to take a not@@ ebook and a pen to record what I see . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I just have to try to remember all the details .
a journalist from O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma accused me of Twitter to give up my im@@ parti@@ ality .
here is the lesson .
tell the story of the prisoner as he wants , and you get access .
I compl@@ ained to her .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she admitted that she &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it could have been better form@@ ulate , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but she still thinks it &apos;s wrong what I do . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Richard G@@ los@@ si@@ p had problem with some of the things I said and wrote .
he doesn &apos;t tell me what I have to write , and I wouldn &apos;t do it even if he would do it .
I told him that he can remove me from his list of witnesses at any time .
but he wants an international repor@@ ter to be present to write there .
when he dies , he thinks that public relations will help the movement against the death penalty .
Kim Bell@@ ware , a repor@@ ter of Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post , will sit next to me .
if you want to know more about the case , please listen to the series of pod@@ casts I &apos;ve made .
I don &apos;t want to go back to all the details here .
I cannot say with certainty that Richard G@@ los@@ si@@ p is innocent .
his actions after the assass@@ ination of Barry Van Tre@@ ese would make him guilty of being a bene@@ fici@@ ary of action .
but I believe that a strong lik@@ el@@ ihood is that he is not guilty of murder .
I believe that there is not enough evidence to justify a death sentence .
I believe his execution is wrong .
and from this perspective I will see him die .
I can &apos;t claim to be really objective .
there will be other repor@@ ters that you can turn to .
what you will get from me is what it means to see a man dying of unnecessary death .
man after damp police ch@@ ase persu@@ aded to come out of the C@@ anning River
the C@@ anning V@@ ale Poli@@ z@@ ist remained dry when he was talking to the man from the C@@ anning River .
an attempt by a man of Per@@ th to hang down the police was un@@ successful when he was in the shallow and sw@@ amp@@ y water , just a few meters away from a police officer trying to persu@@ ade him to return to the shore . &quot;
the police of C@@ anning V@@ ale were called on Tuesday to a house peace incident in basin .
when they discovered the susp@@ ects , he tried to escape them towards the C@@ anning River .
but he did not come too far .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he stood in the water and said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t come out , come and get me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said senior ser@@ ge@@ ant S@@ hand@@ ell Cast@@ led@@ ine . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Con@@ stable Lach@@ lan Per@@ ha@@ ve@@ c was not too enthusiastic about making his uniform wet , so he turned a more reliable tac@@ tic - &quot; A good polic@@ eman . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sometimes people do funny things to try to escape , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said senior ser@@ ge@@ ant Cast@@ led@@ ine . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
championship football player Ben C@@ ous@@ ins offers an unforgettable example .
in 2006 , cous@@ ins drove his car in the dit@@ ch to escape alcohol control and then tried to swim over the S@@ wan River .
his efforts were un@@ successful but inspired natives to the humor@@ ous planning of a Ben C@@ ous@@ ins bi@@ athlon .
Peter M@@ oo@@ dy claims that ste@@ wards tried to spy on him and threat@@ ens to finish racing
Peter M@@ oo@@ dy claims that ste@@ wards from Racing Victoria tried to install a spy in his st@@ ables last year and threatened to finish the race immediately .
he aimed at ste@@ wards and the integrity department of Racing Victoria and claimed that she conducted a personal campaign against him with the L@@ ate S@@ cr@@ at@@ ching of Lady Tat@@ ai for a race day treatment , the last straw on Wednesday .
M@@ oo@@ dy said Fair@@ fax Media that he has always tried to do what is best for racing and he found himself under difficult conditions when it was about the positive cob@@ alt dew @-@ dress rehear@@ sal at Li@@ dar@@ i , which he cannot explain .
he had kept back 18 months because of the es@@ pion@@ age charges and did not want it to &quot; look like too high @-@ hanging grapes . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I had nothing to say about it and I sat on it for a long time , but sometimes you are so frustr@@ ated that everything comes out once , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said M@@ oo@@ dy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they know that it continued .
sometimes you react , and you have to live with the consequences and I have to live with what I said .
tonight I will go home tonight and sleep well .
I would like to walk around the head , and I want my owners to think that I try my best for them .
if they start thinking , I don &apos;t do that , then I shouldn &apos;t be a coach .
I have to think about what I do with my license .
previously M@@ oo@@ dy had sent the bomb in an interview with rac@@ ing.com that the integrity department had tried to spy on his stall .
&quot; eigh@@ teen months ago Ter@@ ry B@@ ail@@ ey , Day@@ le Brown and Dr. Brian Ste@@ wart sat in a room with a man whom I will name when asked - and offered him a job in my st@@ ables to deliver information about what I do within my st@@ ables , &quot; said M@@ oo@@ dy on rac@@ ing.com .
they obviously believe that I am a dec@@ eiver .
if this is the case , they should certainly touch their n@@ oses because they have failed in trying to touch me .
Robert Rou@@ l@@ ston , former Chairman of the R@@ V@@ L , David M@@ oo@@ die , reig@@ ning president of the R@@ V@@ L and Bernard Sa@@ undry , current CEO of the R@@ V@@ L , were aware of this at the time and are still today .
should I think that it will be personal ?
does the R@@ V@@ L have a cow@@ ard@@ ly behaviour and maybe people outside trainers are responsible for what &apos;s going on in the industry ?
am I bad for the industry ?
am I so bad for the industry ?
maybe people think outside that I am .
maybe they have to take my license and cast me off , and I have no doubt that what I say is now about to think about it .
but I am now at the point where it doesn &apos;t matter , and that makes me sad .
that makes me really sad .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I will exercise pressure on them and push them to make a decision . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I have the support of my family and I can go .
the training levels of the trainer have been set up with the long @-@ lasting cob@@ alt investigation at Li@@ dar@@ i , and L@@ ate S@@ cr@@ at@@ ching said that he could &quot; throw his license above the table . &quot;
M@@ oo@@ dy , best known by his preparation of the slaugh@@ tered Master Black C@@ avi@@ ar , described the race @-@ day treatment rule &quot; ridi@@ culous &quot; after a package of mud or clay was applied to the horse &apos;s debate , which viol@@ ated the rules .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is against the rules of racing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have to take full responsibility for it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one of my employees mistakenly put mud on the leg . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it could have been like yesterday evening .
it could have been the whole day yesterday , which was so .
but it was also so on the race day .
M@@ oo@@ dy could be confronted with a three month dis@@ qualification for the treatment with the pack on the race day . an investigation of this matter has been opened .
it is a joke .
people who set up these rules do not know about the horse .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we all see that we need rules , but here you have gone too far , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said M@@ oo@@ dy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

Melbourne @-@ Storm @-@ Trainer Cra@@ ig Bell@@ amy attacks ri@@ vals for claims on ring fighting
Melbourne @-@ Storm @-@ Trainer Cra@@ ig Bell@@ amy has critic@@ ised the Tac@@ kl@@ ing of his players as &quot; Agenda Set@@ ting &quot; of two Premier League favorites of the N@@ R@@ L .
Sydney R@@ oo@@ ster Trainer Tr@@ ent Robinson said that the refer@@ ees allowed the Storm players &quot; ring battles &quot; with his team during the high Storm victory in the qualifying final in Sydney on Friday evening .
Bris@@ ban@@ e Bron@@ cos Trainer Way@@ ne B@@ enn@@ ett made a hardly disgu@@ ised note to the Storm team after his team achieved the final victory against North Que@@ ens@@ land cow@@ boys on Saturday evening . he called the game a &quot; sample example &quot; of the Ru@@ g@@ by League and said that the two from Que@@ ens@@ land were not too good &quot; in rings .
Bell@@ amy defending his team and said that they were only concentrated on their &quot; contact &quot; at the Tac@@ kl@@ ing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bell@@ amy added that the cri@@ tiques of two leading trainers on his team are confident that they were worried about being beaten by the Storm team . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this time and again - I have not heard that Tr@@ ent Robinson talked about ring struggles when they hit us 24 : 2 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bell@@ amy on Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I can guarantee that we have changed nothing in our defensive system or techniques throughout the year . but in the last six weeks we have made contact with Tac@@ kl@@ es a real focus , and this has brought the turn@@ around for us .
Tr@@ ent has been there for three years now , and he obviously has a great team to train . he is therefore probably not accustomed to losing , so it was a bit of a shock for him .
it is funny how this occurs again and again at this time of year .
Bell@@ amy has attacked B@@ enn@@ etts &apos;s idea of &quot; exciting football &quot; and reminds his ment@@ or that B@@ enn@@ etts St George Il@@ la@@ war@@ ra Dra@@ gons won the Premier League in 2010 with &quot; boring &quot; football .
Way@@ ne speaks of exciting football .
he compared his game on Saturday evening with our Friday evening and how exciting her game was , &quot; said Bell@@ amy .
I remember that in 2010 St George was critici@@ zed as a boring team , and Way@@ ne said he will take care of a divor@@ ce .
but now he has a team that can play and that we watch as exciting , especially his young players with their speed .
this is the ball game you want to play when you have this kind of players .
he made this statement in 2010 , now he wants everyone to play his kind of football - not every team has two players like Anthony Mil@@ ford and Ben Hun@@ t , so they can play as they play .
I build stronger confidence because they say these things because they are a bit worried about playing against us .
six weeks ago , they did not think of us when it came to the big games .
Bell@@ amy also pointed out that the game Storm versus R@@ oo@@ sters achieved a higher result than the game Bron@@ cos against cow@@ boys .
the game of the Bron@@ cos was probably a good game , I haven &apos;t seen it yet , but what was the result ? 16 : 12 ?
our game was 20 : 18 , there were two more attempts in our game , but is that an exciting game ?
or are breaks making and no points something exciting ?
for me it &apos;s the game boards .
when they mention us , it means that we will meet them in a single phase .
the Storm team is free this weekend as they have won the right to receive either North Que@@ ens@@ land Cow@@ boys or the C@@ ron@@ ul@@ la Sh@@ arks on the next Saturday night at the A@@ AM@@ I Park . ticket sales begin next Tuesday morning .
Serbian with $ 200,000 Guarant@@ ee on Drug Ad@@ dress
a man who might inc@@ ur a life @-@ long punishment because of his attempt to come into possession of 40 kil@@ os of co@@ ca@@ ine , which was s@@ mu@@ g@@ gled to Que@@ ens@@ land , was released against a deposit of $ 200,000 .
Mark@@ o Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c , 29 , was one of the five men who were arrested last month after the Federal Police found 100 kg of drug on the yacht Sol@@ ay , which came from South America via Van@@ u@@ at@@ u and placed in Co@@ om@@ era in August .
Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c was observed how he met his co @-@ def@@ end@@ ants in the marina in the morning and later in the Café Co@@ om@@ era Road@@ house where the police found 40 kil@@ os of the drug in a Toyota Echo .
despite a potentially life @-@ related penalty for trying to possess a commercial amount of co@@ ca@@ ine , the lawyer von Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c argued that there was no evidence that he tried to own the whole lot and that in the café could have been a harmless reason .
the judge at the Supreme Court , Peter Flan@@ ag@@ an , was worried about the risk of escape at Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c .
he has clear relations with Serbia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he often travels to Serbia , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he explained to the court on Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the case of a criminal case , he lied to the police about his where@@ ab@@ outs .
Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c &apos;s mother and step@@ father had offered a $ 200,000 security deposit in common to achieve his release .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after reading the declarations of the two people , it is clear that the circulation of a security of 200,000 dollars represents a real financial burden , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ju@@ dge Flan@@ ag@@ an . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but this alone will not suff@@ ice to prevent him from appearing , he warned .
Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c was released on security deposit under the conditions that he gives his Australian and his Serbian passport , reported to the police every day and stops at a cur@@ few from 18 : 00 @-@ 06 : 00 .
accident at A5 at Karlsruhe : cab torn apart
in case of a collision with three trucks on the motorway 5 at Karlsruhe a lor@@ ry driver was seriously injured on Tuesday evening .
two of the three trucks involved had bra@@ ked in front of a permanent construction site in the direction of Basel .
the third driver noticed it too late and tried in vain to turn left at the last moment , as the police hur@@ ried .
the cab of the accident origin@@ ator was completely torn apart .
the driver was seriously injured in a hospital .
the A5 between Bru@@ chs@@ al and Karlsruhe @-@ Nord was completely blocked from six hours to 2 pm .
there was a damage in the amount of 12@@ 2,000 euros .
St@@ ev@@ an Ho@@ gg used phone of girls to l@@ ure pa@@ ed@@ op@@ hil@@ es to send pictures
a pa@@ ed@@ op@@ hil@@ er used the phone of a 11 year old girl to request pictures of child abuse .
St@@ ev@@ an Ho@@ gg took the girl &apos;s phone when he fell asleep , logged into an online mess@@ aging service from which he received a series of un@@ decent pictures of children that were sent to him by another user .
the girl later woke up and discovered that the phone was missing and found it in the hand of the sleeping Ho@@ gg .
she saw it , found the conf@@ using news and immediately al@@ armed her mother .
the police took care of it and looked at the five images , then analyzed computers that were found under the address and discovered &quot; relevant &quot; web searches , which used terms for searching for un@@ decent images of children .
Ho@@ gg was then asser@@ ted to the officials that he did it as it would lead to &quot; ped@@ ophi@@ le on the Internet , &quot; and he then &quot; pre@@ tended to be a polic@@ eman in order to frigh@@ ten them . &quot;
the prosec@@ utor E@@ ili@@ d@@ h Rober@@ ts@@ on told the Dun@@ dee Sh@@ eri@@ ff Court : &quot; he said it would be a ad@@ diction to frigh@@ ten people .
he admitted that searching on the computer were carried out by him , but said that it was happening because he wanted to be a polic@@ eman to sc@@ are pa@@ ed@@ op@@ hil@@ es .
he was asked for his conversations with the unknown person who sent him the pictures and asked him to send even more photos .
he said he did it to l@@ ure her .
he said he was sick in the head when he drinks , and said he wanted to see pictures of rape and murder .
MS Rober@@ ts@@ on added : &quot; when the girl found the news on the phone , she called her mother and was on the shaking and crying .
she also saw the un@@ decent images on the phone and confronted the def@@ end@@ ants with it .
the girl was inter@@ viewed and said that the accused computer and Pla@@ yst@@ ation used to talk to girls who looked much younger than he .
Ho@@ gg , 23 , W@@ ard Road , Dun@@ dee , ple@@ aded guilty according to the indictment , having taken un@@ decent pictures of children on 14 June last year , to have viol@@ ated the conditions on 25 January and not to appear before the court on 24 March of this year .
defense attorney Greg@@ or S@@ im asked Ho@@ gg not to appear in the Register of Sex@@ ual Cri@@ mes , as one might argue that &quot; no significant sexual element &quot; could be found in his off@@ ence .
Sh@@ eri@@ ff A@@ list@@ air Car@@ mi@@ ch@@ ael postpon@@ ed the verdict until October in order to obtain background reports on social work .
Ho@@ gg was granted a security deposit in this case but was held in custody pending cases of other pending cases .
he was added to the list of sexual offen@@ ders before the date of judgment .
slu@@ gg@@ ler moves on small border cross@@ ings to Germany
more and more refugees are taken up outside of the major control points at the German @-@ Austrian border .
many tractors made people increasingly at smaller border cross@@ ings out of fear of discovery and arrest .
out of the Austrian side , a spokes@@ man of the Federal Police said .
more than 1000 refugees were picked up along the river Inn Passa@@ u and Rot@@ tal @-@ Inn since Tuesday .
they had reached the German side on foot over bridges and traffic @-@ guns .
there they are received by federal polic@@ emen and rel@@ ayed to the registration .
according to the Federal Police , the Munich main railway station showed clearly more refugees once again in comparison to the start of the week on Wednesday .
around 700 people arrived in the state capital by 8 : 00 alone , said a spokes@@ man in the morning .
after the re @-@ introduction of controls at the German @-@ Austrian border on Tuesday , 17@@ 59 refugees had reached the city .
Stuttgart : for@@ er@@ un@@ ner of tropical storm &quot; Henry &quot; expected in the Sou@@ thwest
meteor@@ ologists warn against storms in the south @-@ west of Wednesday afternoon .
due to a low pressure area over Western Europe , warm sea air flows into the country , divided the German Weather Service ( DW@@ D ) in Stuttgart .
the powerful low was the prec@@ ursor of the tropical storm &quot; Henry , &quot; which was drawn over the Atlantic in recent days by the Bermuda Islands .
violent storms and thunder@@ storms are expected mainly in Baden .
according to DW@@ D , even until Thursday , even in the Black Forest , on the Sw@@ ab@@ ian Al@@ b and in the bottom @-@ sea circle with bu@@ cks from 60 to 90 kilometers per hour .
on Friday the sun can be seen again .
the mass makes it : every two years , the car makers show their novel@@ ties at the IAA .
2015 is above all on the move to the compact cars , which are currently particularly well sold .
cars from the compact class are currently in demand : around 28.@@ 1 percent of new registr@@ ations accounted for this segment alone in August , according to the German Federal Aviation Authority ( KBA ) alone .
this is also reflected at the IAA ( public days 17 to 27 September ) .
many new compact models will be presented this year between all the futur@@ istic concept cars and new luxury cars and luxury cars .
one of the biggest premi@@ eres for the German car industry is the Opel Astra , which will be at deal@@ er@@ ships in autumn .
&quot; the Astra is an extremely important model for us , &quot; said Opel CEO Karl @-@ Thomas Neumann .
it belongs to the core of the brand .
in order for the volume model to be sold well , the new Astra is not to be much more expensive .
Opel puts a start below the biggest competi@@ tor VW Golf in view , which starts at 17,@@ 650 euros .
the current Astra will cost from 16@@ 9@@ 90 Euro .
the Astra is equipped with a new 1.4 @-@ liter engine with 74 kW / 100 hp .
in addition , the Hessen also offer other diesel and gasoline engines of 70 kW / 95 hp to 147 kW / / 200 hp , for the first time also three @-@ cylinder gasoline engines .
unlike the most important competitors VW Golf and Ford Focus , the Opel Astra is only five @-@ door .
the second variant will follow in the spring of the Com@@ bi , which is also visible at the IAA .
and what will happen next to the Astra at the IAA or at new compact cars ?
Renault Mé@@ gan@@ e : Renault sends the fourth generation of its Astra competi@@ tor Mé@@ gan@@ e into the race .
at the trade fair , the Mé@@ gan@@ e is only available as a five @-@ door in a conventional sporty GT version .
in the trade he arrives at the beginning of next year , then also as a comb@@ i .
Infin@@ iti : brand new in the segment is Infin@@ iti Q@@ 30 .
the Nissan pilot wants to find its position in the strongly growing segment with the new model .
the compact Infin@@ iti with its curved lines fits perfectly into the design line of the brand .
the basic model will get a petrol engine with an output of at least 90 kW / 122 hp .
there is also a diesel with 80 kW / 109 hp or 125 kW / 170 hp .
Su@@ zu@@ ki Bal@@ eno : new in the segment is also the Su@@ zu@@ ki Bal@@ eno , which celebrates its world premiere in Frankfurt .
the model is offered with gasoline engines , including a newly developed 1.0 @-@ liter turbo engine and a power of 82 kW / 111 b@@ hp .
the maximum torque is 170 Nm ( Nm ) according to manufacturer &apos;s specifications .
sales launch of the Bal@@ eno in Europe is scheduled for spring 2016 .
DS 4 : not entirely new but completely renewed is the compact class model DS 4 , which can be seen at the IAA .
outside , the designers of the noble Cit@@ ro@@ ë@@ n @-@ Ab@@ leg@@ er placed hand at the front end : here the radiator grill was re@@ drawn and the changed head@@ lights equipped with LED technology .
the inf@@ otainment system was especially modernis@@ ed in the interior , reducing the number of buttons by a touch screen and integrated Apple Car@@ Play for the first time .
at the IAA in the compact class , there are also a number of re@@ visions and new variants such as the f@@ used Mercedes A @-@ Class or the Peugeot 30@@ 8 G@@ TI .
J@@ VA Berlin Te@@ gel : five square meters of cell are human
the Federal Constitutional Court has given a former prisoner of the Pen@@ it@@ enti@@ ary Institution Te@@ gel , which was housed in a small cell for months .
because of the violation of their human dignity , det@@ ain@@ ees are generally entitled to financial compensation if they are housed in too small cells .
this was decided by the Federal Constitutional Court in a decision published on Wednesday .
the parties , according to the judges , can even hope for money if they were imprisoned only a few days in the confined spaces ( A@@ z . : 1 BvR 1@@ 127 / 14 ) .
thus an ex @-@ prisoner with his constitutional complaint was successful in Karlsruhe : he was accommod@@ ated in a private cell in Berlin @-@ Te@@ gel between June and November 2009 in a single cell with approximately five square meters of floor space ; the toilet was spati@@ ally not separated .
after that , the man , who , according to his lawyer , was now on the free foot , was transferred to a larger cell .
his term of office because of the un@@ worthy detention conditions against the State of Berlin failed .
however , the Constitutional Court raised the judgment of the Berlin Chamber of Justice and re@@ mitted the case to the renewed examination .
they see the man &apos;s dignity injured .
chamber Court now decides on the amount of compensation
even if for legal reasons only a few days of arrest were decisive for compensation , a compensation was given , it was said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; otherwise , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a victim would be afraid of the legal protection of the personality . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Chamber of Commerce must now clarify the amount of money compensation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the past , the constitutional judges have often strengthened the rights of prisoners . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
thus they said only in April a det@@ ain@@ ee of compensation because he was locked naked in a cell .
according to a decision of 2011 , the multiple assignment of a cell without separate toilet is also in@@ humane .
in addition , on Wednesday , Karlsruhe also confirmed the Berlin Constitutional Court , who had agreed to a in@@ decent housing in a parallel case in November 2009 .
the then plain@@ ti@@ ff was lod@@ ged between 15 and 21 hours a day between 15 and 21 hours in a similar cell as in the Karls@@ ru@@ her case .
in recent weeks , the pris@@ ons had come to the head@@ lines because of lack of staff .
prisoners are therefore locked up for 23 hours , the aggres@@ si@@ veness rises , even to ra@@ ckets it should have come because of the ten@@ se situation .
according to the Office of Justice , 21 jobs in Te@@ gel are not occupied due to junior lack , 19 should fall away in 2016 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Angela Merkel and the refugee policy : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are creating this &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the immigration of refugees is an enormous challenge - the Chancellor is determined to accept it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
what is coming to Germany ?
according to statements by the Federal Ministry of the Interior , around 800 000 asylum seek@@ ers will come to Germany this year , according to the testimony of Vice @-@ Chancellor Sig@@ mar Gabriel ( SPD ) , Germany is even able to take up a million refugees .
German Chancellor Angela Merkel ( CD@@ U ) demonstrated determination in the face of the unusual challenge : &quot; I say again and again : we can do this and we can do that . &quot;
what comes to Germany gives the following overview .
according to different forecasts , there are between 350@@ 000 ( estimate of the Federal Ministry of Building ) and 400@@ ,000 ( estimate of the P@@ est@@ el Institute ) apartments annually - and for the next five years .
this is almost twice as much as it has previously been built ( 250@@ 000 apartments ) .
the lack of living space is dramatic , but above all with affordable rental objects : 60@@ 000 to 80@@ 000 social housing are out of the rental price per year , and these particularly advantageous apartments will also apply for refugees .
Federal Minister Barbara Hend@@ ri@@ cks ( SPD ) aims to double the funding from currently 5@@ 18 million to one billion euros .
much too little is from the point of view of the P@@ est@@ el Institute : 80 000 social apartments annually would have to arise and the federal government would have to invest in the amount of 6.@@ 4 billion a year .
in agreement , scientists and federal government ministers agree that there must also be more tax advantages for investment in housing construction .
according to estimates by the Institute for Employment Research , 55 per cent of the refugees in Germany can be employed in the long term .
however , refugees in Germany would not be systematically asked about their qualifications in order to help them get started , Claudia Walter , project manager for integration and education , critic@@ ises the Ber@@ tel@@ smann Foundation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but for the integration of refugees it is crucial whether they will find work in Germany . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
work is the key to social contacts , for the appreciation in the admission society , but also for the self @-@ este@@ em of immigrants , migration researcher Dietrich Thr@@ än@@ hardt says .
according to Thr@@ än@@ hardt , there has been a political change in Germany : from prohibition of work for refugees to recognise work .
while there was a ban on employment for asylum seek@@ ers of up to five years earlier , this was reduced to three months in November 2014 , as well as the duty of residen@@ cy to restrict asylum seek@@ ers to a place of residence .
in society - also because of the shortage of skilled labour - the majority of the views have been established that refugees should be able to access the labour market faster .
a major hur@@ dle for access to the labour market is a lack of German knowledge .
so far there is no sufficient offer of general and professional language courses .
studies also show that jobs most often be communicated through personal contacts .
for this reason , the building of networks is based on Thr@@ es@@ hardt the Royal Road to Labour Integration .
the Berlin school administration has found that only a few fled parents give their children to the kit@@ es , an estimated ten to 15 per cent : &quot; for the un@@ rooted parents it is only once very important to keep the family together , &quot; says Il@@ ja Ko@@ esch@@ bar , spokes@@ man for youth and family in the Berlin Senate Administration .
in order to convince the family nevertheless of the advantages of the K@@ ita , the administration distri@@ butes hand@@ books in different languages .
if the need for educ@@ ators is increasing due to the large number of refugees , the Berlin Senate would try to increase the capacity of training - for example by allowing more specialised schools .
in the countries , students without knowledge of German will be prepared in the classes .
but they are not always taught by fully trained teachers , but , as in Berlin , also by teachers who only have a qualification in German as a second language .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is no shortage of them , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Be@@ ate St@@ ones from the Berlin school administration . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the German Studenten@@ werk estimates that about 20 percent of refugees are planning to study in Germany .
in principle , no federal state prohi@@ bits asylum seek@@ ers or tolerated the study - the only exception to date has been Berlin , internal sen@@ ator Frank Henkel ( CD@@ U ) has now given up his stance .
willing refugees could be reli@@ eved of access to the university .
for refugees with a residence refund or D@@ ul@@ dung do not receive any benefits after the asylum seek@@ ers &apos; performance act when they begin a study .
the latter generally do not get a b@@ af@@ ö@@ g , as they do not fall under the circle of the bene@@ fici@@ ary persons .
tolerated refugees have had to live for four years in Germany to be eligible for B@@ af@@ ö@@ g , from 1 January 2016 , this span will be shortened to 15 months .
but this gap must be closed , too , calls for Steffen Kra@@ ch , Berlin &apos;s State Secretary for Science , and the German Studenten@@ werk .
students should get B@@ af@@ ö@@ g immediately .
Islam will play a more important role in the future , as many refugees are Muslims , and for many , religion is an important part of their identity .
the state should gradually admit the same rights to Islam as they have the churches , and the existing state churches right to develop a new state @-@ of @-@ religion relationship .
it would also be important to establish an Islamic Wel@@ fare Association , which takes care of the newcom@@ ers .
the rights also include duties .
thus , the representatives of Islam must agree on clear contact persons and be prepared to cooperate with the state in many areas and to grant him certain control options .
this also includes the willingness to deal with religious fundament@@ alism .
the Chairman of the Central Council of the Muslims , A@@ im@@ an Maz@@ ye@@ k , expressed concern on Thursday that religious conflicts could also be carried in to Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; those who wanted to stra@@ y such conflicts in Germany &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; immediately have their right to stay here , in Germany , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he said in Bay@@ erischer Rundfunk . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he proposed to translate the Basic Law into Arabic .
integration will continue to be a topic of the whole society in the future .
in this way , the majority society will have to change , the reduction of discrimination and rac@@ ism will be more urgent .
Germany , as a result of European decisions , has been an anti @-@ discrimination agency and a general gender equality law since a short decade .
but it slowly lear@@ ns how the NS@@ U mur@@ ders showed , in which police and authorities ignored the rac@@ ist motive .
equal opportunities for all : what migrants and advoc@@ acy groups of non @-@ white German are demanding long and why international agreements such as the anti @-@ rac@@ ism convention are committed to Germany must become a reality in the coming years if the country is peaceful and its new citizens should use their opportunities - for the benefit of all .
in general , Germany is able to provide medical care for the previously expected refugees , says Frank Ulrich Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery , President of the Association .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as for man@@ - power and capacities , we create this , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said the Tages@@ spiegel . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , additional money must flow into the system .
in order to avoid bott@@ len@@ ecks , Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery ur@@ ges to susp@@ end health maps to all newcom@@ ers .
services rendered could later be settled with the federal states .
and in the long term it is highly question@@ able to leave so many people with the limited range of services that the asylum seek@@ ers &apos; act of asylum fores@@ ees .
apart from that , the doctors do mainly the language barriers to create .
already so far , the Berlin health scientist The@@ a Bor@@ de has demonstrated that migrants are more informed about their diseases than other patients .
not only in hospitals , also in doctor &apos;s sur@@ geri@@ es , interpre@@ ting costs would have to be taken over .
many refugees were also helped with more general medical centres in emergency ambul@@ ances .
and with another diagnostic view .
there is much more un@@ attended disability among refugees among refugees , and in young people it is about HIV enligh@@ tenment .
but with the partially other diseases , German doctors are coming from their training , but Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery believes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; paras@@ ite inf@@ estation or tuber@@ cu@@ lo@@ sis are not so difficult to recognize . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and as for the medical lack , it may even be allevi@@ ated by the refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Syrians would have developed a highly developed educational system , and some refugees even were doctors .
in order to be able to practice , however , they must prove their qualifications and possibly take examinations once more .
at least half of the refugees arriving in Germany are mentally ill according to estimates by the Federal Psycho@@ therap@@ e@@ ut@@ enk@@ ammer ( B@@ P@@ t@@ K ) : most suffer from a post@@ trau@@ matic stress disorder or depression .
refugee children are particularly vulnerable , says Dietrich Mun@@ z , President of the B@@ P@@ t@@ K .
a recently published study conducted by the TU Munich proves that every fifth Syrian refugee child is traumati@@ zed in Germany .
those who are suffering from a post@@ trau@@ matic stress disorder suffers , among other things , so @-@ called flas@@ hes with short@@ ness of breath , di@@ zz@@ iness , heart@@ beat and death @-@ fears .
other symptoms include sleep and concentration problems , strong fri@@ ght and emotional num@@ b@@ ness .
in order to prevent the symptoms from chronic , early treatment is necessary , explained Mun@@ z .
until now , only four percent of the mentally ill refugees receive a psycho@@ therapy .
although psych@@ ically ill asylum seek@@ ers in the social offices can submit a request for psycho@@ therapy , the treatment usually takes several months .
in addition , in the social offices , semi @-@ skilled workers or doctors who are not trained for mental illness would decide whether a therapy is necessary or not .
this often leads to mis@@ calculations , says Mun@@ z .
Man@@ ege invites you to dream
with the new st@@ aging &quot; Passion , &quot; Circus Pro@@ bst looks back on the traditions of cir@@ cus arts .
the aim is to attract each age group under the spell of fascinating ac@@ rob@@ atics , animal dres@@ sage and unique entertainment .
now the Circus Pro@@ bst invites you to dream in the Man@@ ege on a brick .
&quot; our passion is the cir@@ cus . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I can &apos;t imagine living without my cir@@ cus family , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Stephan@@ ie Pro@@ bst , animal teacher and junior chef . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; passion &quot; - under this motto is the current production stage .
for more than 33 years , the Circus has been in the hands of the Pro@@ bst family .
so the family &apos;s gift is in the blood .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is important for us to take away people from their everyday life and take them to a completely different world for two hours , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; emphasizes the 27 @-@ year @-@ old Juni@@ or@@ ch@@ ef@@ in . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; man@@ e@@ gen@@ ial cocktail with cos@@ mop@@ olitan flair &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Director Reinhard Pro@@ bst his concept . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
50 cities on the barely 3 000 km long tour can now experience this flair .
the program of the Circus impres@@ ses with talented artists from all over the world .
excellent at the international cir@@ cus festival in Monte Carlo , the Russian St@@ oli@@ aro@@ v C@@ lown Family captiv@@ ates the audience with charm and charm .
the Cas@@ tillo Brothers also understand their craft .
with the heroes of silent movies , the Cu@@ ban duo will be able to easily record it .
ease and ag@@ ility - they identify with these words .
her humor@@ ous art on the mast is meant to conquer women &apos;s hearts in a storm .
besides numerous salmon @-@ fish , the ac@@ rob@@ atics of the Circus Pro@@ bst also fascin@@ ates with dex@@ ter@@ ity and artic@@ ulation .
balance with the un@@ ic@@ ycle on a ball ?
for He Yuan no problem .
snake humans fascin@@ ate and frigh@@ ten at the same time .
W@@ ang L@@ in from China is familiar with the oldest form of ac@@ rob@@ atics like little others and fascin@@ ates with its flexibility .
60 employees from twelve nations offer diversity in every respect .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the animals belong to our family , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stressed Stephan@@ ies Mother , Brigitte Pro@@ bst . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; gri@@ ev@@ ances in the attitude of cir@@ cus animals are only too often subject to various animal welfare organisations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Stephan@@ ie Pro@@ bst also takes a position : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if our animals are not good , it &apos;s not good for us either . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
around 80 animals from five different continents enjoy each pet@@ ting unit .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; four @-@ leg@@ ged arti@@ stes &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; as they are lovingly called , will be read from the eyes whenever possible . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we want to work with the animals and have fun with them .
if the animal does not feel comfortable , it does not want to go into the arena .
the highest commandment , therefore , is good for the animals .
especially on her zeb@@ roid jum@@ bo , a mixture of a Sh@@ et@@ land pon@@ y stallion and a zeb@@ ra mare , the family Pro@@ bst is proud .
the two animals lived together in one enclosure for eight years and nothing happened .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but then , suddenly , our little jum@@ bo was there , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Brigitte Pro@@ bst . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the zeb@@ roid is not ready for the Man@@ ege , but it &apos;s the unique mas@@ cot of Circus Pro@@ bst .
so for each visitor there is something to do with it .
&quot; one thing is certain , &quot; says Stephan@@ ie Pro@@ bst : &quot; no matter if five or 1 200 viewers , we always do our best and are with all our heart . &quot;
the Circus Pro@@ bst invites you to your performances every day from 17 to 20 September .
on Sunday the program starts at 11 a.m. and 4 p.m .
Thursday is a family day , for the presentation at 5 pm the prices are reduced .
the Ti@@ ersch@@ au is open daily from 10 am to 6 pm .
Sim@@ bab@@ we@@ es Robert Mu@@ gabe holds wrong speech in parliament
Mr Mu@@ gabe , Africa &apos;s oldest leader , dropped the stairs from a podium in the beginning of the year .
he remained un@@ har@@ med , but the video of the case quickly spread across the social media .
the Parliament &apos;s opening was also clou@@ ded by the asser@@ tions by members of the opposition that they would have received anonymous death threats and warned them to accompany Mr Mu@@ gabe &apos;s speech with vo@@ ids .
last month , they had spread it and interrupted him during his speech on the state of the nation in parliament - this is the speech he repeated on Tuesday .
the spokes@@ man of the Movement for Democratic Change ( Movement for Democratic Change - M@@ DC ) In@@ no@@ cent Gon@@ ese said that seven opposition politicians have received SMS messages on their phones that warned them of interfer@@ ing with Mr. Mu@@ gabe &apos;s speech .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the message comes from a number that is not displayed , but it has the title &apos; death &apos; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said repor@@ ters to Mu@@ gabe &apos;s speech . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it warns the members of the Parliament that the immunity in Parliament ends , and as soon as they leave the Parliament , their parliamentary immunity is no longer effective . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the chief speaker said that the party led by Morgan T@@ s@@ van@@ gi@@ ra@@ i is &quot; worried &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; about the dangers for politicians . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Hewlett @-@ Packard will build up to 30,000 jobs
Hewlett @-@ Packard is expected to build 25,000 to 30,000 jobs within the framework of restructuring and saving efforts in the company &apos;s services .
later this year , HP will split into two listed companies and separate the computer and printer business from its faster growing enterprise hardware and service business activities .
the expected job cuts lead to a load of over 2.7 billion dollars from the fourth quarter , HP said in an explanation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these restructuring measures will enable a more competitive , more sustainable cost structure for the new Hewlett @-@ Packard @-@ Enterprise , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Me@@ g Whit@@ man , HP chairman and Chief Executive , who will lead the unit after separation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; Hewlett Packard Enterprise will be smaller and more focused than it is today , and we have a broad and deep@@ ened portfolio of businesses that support businesses in transition to a new style of business , &quot; Whit@@ man said .
as an independent company , we are better positioned than ever before to satisfy the changing needs of our customers all over the world .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hewlett Packard Enterprise has more than 50 billion annual revenues and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; will be focused on delivering unprecedented , integrated technology solutions for businesses , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains the company &apos;s statement . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it spl@@ its a company founded in the 19@@ 30s by the graduates of Stan@@ ford University , Hewlett Packard and Dave Packard in order to produce electro @-@ equip@@ ments and their Pal@@ o Alto Garage is called &quot; the birth place of the Si@@ licon Valley . &quot;
HP has gone through a massive restructuring in order to handle the departure of traditional PCs to mobile devices .
the measure of HP , the world &apos;s second @-@ largest PC maker and one of the largest U.S. tech companies , is the latest in this field , based on the conviction that closely focused businesses perform better performance .
FC Ar@@ senal @-@ Captain Mik@@ el Art@@ eta says that team @-@ mates must stand in front of the game against Dynam@@ o Zagreb behind the injured Jack Wil@@ sh@@ ere
Wen@@ ger also stressed Wil@@ sh@@ ere that it is only September , and if his rehabilitation runs according to plan , there is no reason why he can &apos;t play again before Christmas .
this optim@@ istic scenario already means that Wil@@ sh@@ ere will certainly miss at least the next four games for England , and in view of his history his participation in the next summer will certainly be uncertain .
the big shame in this current problem is that Wil@@ sh@@ ere had finished the last season after a separate ank@@ le injury and then returned to his old momentum during the pre @-@ season .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this kind of injury does not thre@@ aten the career , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wen@@ ger . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is a bone that did not heal well .
this is not a major issue .
this was just an accident .
it was not in combination with his an@@ kl@@ es or with the injuries he had previously had .
this may be true from a purely medical point of view , but as Wen@@ ger also recognized , there is the associated risk of further injuries , whenever a player tries to return in the middle of the season .
it also develops an unpleasant pattern .
the investigation of Prime Minister Inj@@ uries Ltd has listed 23 different diseases of Wil@@ sh@@ ere since its debut six years ago .
he also played in just 65 of Ar@@ sen@@ als 157 league games in the last five seasons .
the broader picture for ar@@ senal is that in six out of eight game times since 2007 / 08 , they were one of the two premi@@ er League clubs which recorded most of the vulner@@ ability .
Wen@@ ger accepts the potential of a vi@@ cious circle , but ar@@ senal believes that an improvement in the vulner@@ ability rate will last for the last season .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sometimes when you come back from an injury , you have a due time period , a time in which you need to strengthen your body and win combat strength , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wen@@ ger . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Jack is young enough to overcome this .
I hope his body stabili@@ zes , I am confident that he will do it and he will go through a career of the way he deserves .
ar@@ senal starts its Champions League season on Wednesday evening against Din@@ amo Zagreb in front of the games against Chelsea on Saturday and against Tot@@ ten@@ ham Hot@@ spur on Wednesday , and Wen@@ ger turns a rotation within the team .
H@@ é@@ c@@ tor Bell@@ er@@ ín and Aaron Ram@@ sey did not travel to Croatia , which means that Math@@ ie@@ u Deb@@ u@@ chy and Art@@ eta are likely to start .
Wen@@ ger can also start with K@@ ier@@ an Gib@@ bs and Oli@@ vier Gi@@ rou@@ d instead of Nach@@ o Mon@@ real and The@@ o Wal@@ cot@@ t .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I try to keep the balance and allow the players who need a little break @-@ up break , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wen@@ ger . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
although ar@@ senal &apos;s clear favour@@ ites are to go through group F , the Mak@@ si@@ mir stadium in Zagreb belongs to the play@@ grounds with the biggest in@@ timi@@ dation effect in Europe .
dynam@@ o is also defeated after 41 games after the inv@@ inci@@ ble campaign was launched during the last season .
the stadium was sh@@ attered on Tuesday evening by an earthquake measuring 3.@@ 2@@ s on the Richter scale .
this year it was the 10th in Zagreb .
Wen@@ ger believes that ar@@ senal has pulled out the lesson from the past season with the Champions League capit@@ ulation against Monaco and remains driven by the far@@ away hope to lead the association to its first European cup triumph with its management .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this drive is immense , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wen@@ ger . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it has never worked out at Ar@@ senal .
we were very close to it in 2006 , but on the other hand I &apos;m long enough in business to be realistic .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are ambitious but we are not dre@@ am@@ ers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
friendship Fe@@ ast : the com@@ edy show giving us serious lessons on men &apos;s friend@@ ships
the absence of similar represent@@ ations in shows is obvious , especially with regard to how the need for men to open up is now more desperate than ever before , as suicide rates among young men prove on a 15 year high .
in 2013 , it was the most important cause of death in men aged 20 to 45 in Great Britain , and it remains three times more common in men than women .
in an effort to tackle the problem , the Camp@@ aig@@ n Against Living Mis@@ er@@ ably ( Cal@@ m - campaign against a pi@@ tiful life ) 2015 announced as the year of the man to question the culture that prevents men from seeking help if they need them .
friendship is the heart of the struggle to overcome this challenge .
a recent study of more than 2,000 high school students with depres@@ sive symptoms found that if the suff@@ erer had a sufficiently high percentage of friends with &quot; healthy mood , &quot; his chances of recovery were doubled .
for those who are not de@@ pressed , a circle of mentally healthy friends hal@@ ves the risks of mental problems .
but of course you have to have friends so that a friendship can work .
in the age of communication led through social media , with emphasis on substance on substance , the immedi@@ acy of the answer is often more important than an important contact .
our digital lives have doubled the need to appear strong , fun and successful , even though in reality the isolation domin@@ ates .
this super@@ ficial success is dominated by what psych@@ ologists call ex@@ trin@@ sic values ; money , image , social status , all at the expense of intrin@@ sic values - our inner y@@ earning for personal development and friendship that affects our mental health much deeper .
and as a video game invent@@ or and billi@@ on@@ aire recently declared , money can really not buy happiness .
the beauty of Friends was that this focus was placed on the head .
each character was defined not by his work , but by his personality , which gle@@ amed through the interaction as a friend .
the hum@@ our of Jo@@ ey and Ch@@ and@@ ler &apos;s frequent hu@@ gs , moments in football look in comfortable arm@@ chairs and the longing of Ross to Rachel - all this came out of the knowledge that men can relate to each case even though they are often reluc@@ tant to fully explore their feelings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as an employee of the telephone ministry I explained : ... &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my listening role for people who feel de@@ pressed and com@@ promised has really showed me how even the smallest interactions of friends can make a difference . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the men who contact us often feel unable to talk to friends .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the old saying &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I come with it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has an enormous effect , like the feeling that it is perceived as weakness if you talk about problems openly . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; friends is one of the shows that comes to mind when trying to offer long @-@ term cop@@ ing mechanisms . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it clearly presents the small moments of friend@@ ships .
so much my objective out@@ sider status about the telephone people may also help people in moments of despair , the long @-@ term support comes from a personal network of family and friends .
and so , if you visit Com@@ edy Central Friend@@ s@@ Fest this weekend to celebrate the day completely re@@ designed scenery , why then do not take your friends to a drink in Central Per@@ k .
or , even better if you see someone sitting in Star@@ bu@@ cks alone , give him a smile and say hello .
you never know which difference your friendship could make .
friends will be sent to Com@@ edy Central from beginning to end - all 2@@ 36 episodes - for # Friend@@ s@@ Fest
di Maria meets to help PS@@ G to cr@@ ush Malm@@ ö
angel Di Maria celebrates with Bla@@ ise Mat@@ u@@ id@@ i and Ed@@ inson Cav@@ ani after his hit against Malm@@ ö .
at his debut in the Champions League on Tuesday and helps PS@@ G to pass by Malm@@ ö .
here are the game report and the reaction to the game .
angel Di Maria and Ed@@ inson Cav@@ ani held a course when Paris Saint @-@ Ger@@ main started his Champions League season with a very comfortable 2 @-@ 0 victory against Malm@@ ö in the Prin@@ zen@@ park stadium on Tuesday .
di Maria met less than four minutes after the launch of his Champions League debut as PS@@ G player , who brought the French master to the road , but afterwards they missed a number of occasions before they finally got their lead when Cav@@ ani scored a head football in the 6@@ 1st minute .
with Real Madrid and Schach@@ t@@ j@@ or Don@@ et@@ sk also in the A group , Paris needs a strong start against the Swedish champion , since they are not only striving for the qualification for the kno@@ ck l@@ aps , but an improvement on the way to the quar@@ ter@@ fin@@ als in each of the last three campaigns .
but while they got the points , there was no clas@@ h of Laurent Blan@@ cs team with Z@@ lat@@ an I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ cs missed chances in front of the gate . later he was replaced in the game against his hom@@ etown team and against the association with which he began his illustri@@ ous career in 1999 .
&quot; it &apos;s not easy to win at home or out in the Champions League . therefore , it &apos;s a good start to win 2 : 0 , cause our opponents problems and look relaxed , even if there are certain things that we have to perfect over the season , &quot; Blanc said .
&quot; this is a good omen .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we wanted to win and we won , although I regret that we haven &apos;t scored one or two more goals . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after his injury I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c returned to the Paris team after his injury , which could last weekend a 2 : 2 tie at his own place against Bordeaux in the First league , but he was ej@@ ected in the fourth minute by Di Maria .
the Argent@@ ine@@ an wing storm was referred to as the man who took PS@@ G to the next level in Europe , and he pointed out why when he entered Marco Ver@@ rat@@ tis Pass behind the Malm@@ ö defense before joining Johan Wil@@ and past the long corner of the grid .
but if someone believed that PS@@ G would achieve a big win , he was disappointed .
Malm@@ ö , who hit Cel@@ tic in a play @-@ off to reach this level , joined An@@ pi@@ ff with nine national players on the field and was a five @-@ man defense and two deep in the middle field lined up a heavy opponent .
but besides a shot by Nikol@@ a D@@ jur@@ d@@ j@@ ic , who passed far to Kevin Tra@@ pps P@@ fo@@ sten in the 3@@ 4th minute , they offered little to the attack .
instead , PS@@ G himself sometimes got up , with some mis@@ ses and bad degrees , not least from I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c , who only scrat@@ ched in the first half in the first half and then abandoned after Cav@@ ani had used it after re@@ bo@@ oting .
nevertheless he proved much more skill when he brought his fellow players into play , and it was a passport of I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c , whom Di Maria transformed into a shooting shot , which was directed by Wil@@ and in the 5@@ 2nd minute at the post ...
the second gate finally fell short after the hours mark thanks to Cav@@ ani . the Urugu@@ ay@@ an achieved his sixth season after I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c had a left flan@@ k of Max@@ well .
that ended all the thought that Malm@@ ö can come back in the game , and only an excellent intervention of Wil@@ and from the shortest distance to stop David Lu@@ iz could keep the end result low before replacement player E@@ z@@ equi@@ el Lav@@ e@@ zzi has been recognized by a gate at the end .
the coach of Malm@@ ö , Age Har@@ ei@@ de , later admitted that PS@@ G played a class over his team , and the Norwegian said : &quot; our last Champions League game was last year in December .
since then we have played only in the Swedish league , which has not the same level .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the qualification games are not enough . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
hat off in front of Paris !
it was a great game of them !

the company sold the new shar@@ ehol@@ dings to 125 P@@ ence per share , which meant a 2.4 percent discount on the closing price on Tuesday .
there were 1.3 billion shares worth up to 9.@@ 99 percent of the Group .
concerns regarding a long @-@ term growth in China have cut iron ore prices around half , coal , copper and other commodity prices have declined by 20 to 40 percent .

X@@ av@@ i : PE@@ P Guardi@@ ola prevented 2008 switching to FC Bayern
world and European champion X@@ av@@ i has been playing for the al @-@ S@@ add Sport Club in Qatar since summer 2015
the FC Bayern was obviously shortly before the commitment of Spain &apos;s super@@ star X@@ av@@ i , who then played for FC Barcelona .
eight times Spanish champion , three times champion winner , four times champion league winner , two times champion world champion , two times champion champion , one time World Champion - the title list of X@@ av@@ i is breathtaking .
in summer , the 35 @-@ year @-@ old left FC Barcelona after 24 years and switched to the al @-@ S@@ add Sport Club to Qatar .
but in an interview with the Mar@@ ca , X@@ av@@ i now reveals that he was already leaving Barcelona ahead of the 2008 European Championship .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I told me that Bar@@ ça is selling me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Madrid won everything , we don &apos;t know , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and the registered also the FC Bayern .
X@@ av@@ i : &quot; there was an offer of Bavaria . &quot;
&quot; Rum@@ men@@ ig@@ ge wanted to have me . &quot;
reminder : in the summer of 2008 Jürgen Klin@@ smann took over the FC Bayern .
Guardi@@ ola was the reason that X@@ av@@ i did not change
but the change did not come about .
and the decisive man for this work today for the German record master : PE@@ P Guardi@@ ola .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; X@@ av@@ i explains why : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bar@@ ça has taken Guardi@@ ola and I played a great European Championship . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; PE@@ P told me that I wouldn &apos;t change that he couldn &apos;t imagine the team without me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; with this he got me . &quot;
who knows how Bavaria &apos;s playing time in 2008 / 2009 would have run with X@@ av@@ i .
X@@ av@@ i stood for Bar@@ ca in the quar@@ ter@@ fin@@ als of the Champions League against the Bavarian over the entire distance on the lawn , switched off the reds ( 4 : 0 , 1 : 1 ) and celebrated the King &apos;s Triumph at the end .
matt Dam@@ on Pla@@ ys Di@@ versity in Film@@ making
matt Dam@@ on confronted the Af@@ ro @-@ American film@@ maker Eff@@ ie Brown during a discussion about the diversity and said she is not needed behind the scenes .
as a result of the Sunday Night of HB@@ OS Project Green@@ light , the experienced actor Brown dis@@ rupted the need for alternative perspectives and in terms of a black protagon@@ ist in the selected screen@@ play of the project .
&quot; if we talk about diversity , then do it in the filling of the film and not in the cast of the show , &quot; Dam@@ on assured .
brown re@@ acted shocked , with insul@@ ted un@@ belief and called &quot; Ho@@ o ! w@@ ow . okay , &quot; when the comments of the actor by The Mar@@ tian strengthened .
Dam@@ on and Brown joined Ben Aff@@ l@@ eck and the Far@@ rel@@ ly brothers to discuss the show fin@@ alists .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I want to encourage people to think about it - whoever will always be the director - how to treat the figure of the Harmony , &quot; Brown said at first .
the only black person , and she is a N@@ ut@@ te , beaten by her white stock@@ holding .
the producer of De@@ ar White People set up for the fin@@ alists Leo Angel@@ os and Kri@@ sten Bran@@ c@@ accio for directing rights to the film ; Dam@@ on responded that her direction &quot; at the end could give us something that we don &apos;t want . &quot;
after the discussion was broad@@ cast@@ ed , the social media explo@@ ded before dis@@ approval of Dam@@ on &apos;s comments .
Twitter users Mr Po@@ oni squee@@ zed his anger over the clip by writing &quot; Matt Dam@@ on talks about the only black person in the room , so he can explain their diversity - that &apos;s SO WE@@ ISS that it hur@@ ts . &quot;
the T@@ we@@ et earned more than 5,000 ret@@ we@@ ets and 4,000 lan@@ kes since its release .
Dam@@ on &apos;s comments come at a time when precise ra@@ cial representation in the media is at the forefront of social discussion .
after the teen@@ ager Michael Brown was killed by a white polic@@ eman in 2014 , the Movement Black Li@@ ves Mat@@ ter achieved a nationwide impact and urged legis@@ lators and authorities to put discrimin@@ atory practices against the above .
in February the singer Prince made an all@@ usion to the movement during the introduction of the nominated albums of the year at the Gram@@ my Awards .
&quot; album still matter , &quot; ( albums still have their meaning ) he said .
like books and black life , albums still have their meaning .
more recently , leaders of the Black Li@@ ves Mat@@ ter Movement have published an explanation , in response to the question of the Fox News personality , Elisabeth Has@@ sel@@ beck , whether the group should be regarded as a group of hate .
&quot; the Network Black Li@@ ves Mat@@ ter is a love group , &quot; said the leaders .
recently it was announced that Dam@@ on was on a list of enter@@ tain@@ ers , producers and media mo@@ gu@@ ins who are invited to visit the Pope to discuss the representation of the Catholic Church in the West .
whether he accepted the invitation or already met the Pope is unclear .
American Nin@@ ja War@@ ri@@ or crow@@ ned first champion
professional sport clim@@ ber and operating aid Isaac Cal@@ di@@ ero became the first ath@@ lete , who won the American Nin@@ ja War@@ ri@@ or on Monday evening and took home the Grand Prix of $ 1 million .
the competition show , which had just ended its 7th season , never experienced a competition participant , who was able to complete all stages of his obstacle course .
during the season finale there were two men , Cal@@ di@@ ero and cam@@ er@@ aman Ge@@ off Brit@@ ten , until the final .
the last task was to climb a 75 @-@ foot climb rope in 30 seconds .
Brit@@ ten finished the task within the time he was the first ath@@ lete to complete the exhau@@ sting Phase 4 of American Nin@@ ja War@@ ri@@ or . however , Cal@@ di@@ ero finished this challenge full three seconds faster , making him the winner .
Cal@@ di@@ ero spoke with E ! News after the hard @-@ fought victory , still under the shock of winning the Grand Prix of 1 Million $ .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I mean , it &apos;s amazing to think about it , I &apos;ve never earned more than 10,000 dollars or had to live , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Isaac E said ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; about his he@@ ap of money . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
so all of a sudden ... as I can &apos;t even imagine how this is ... the future is unknown .
the leading producer K@@ ent We@@ ed sat down with The Hollywood Repor@@ ter to discuss the final and why Brit@@ ten , although he first finished the course , won &apos;t receive any prize money .
according to the rules , money goes to the fastest person .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if there is more than one fin@@ alist , it gets the fastest time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said We@@ ed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
how much money is a wonderful price and changes life , it receives the great gr@@ ati@@ fication .
I don &apos;t think he won any gru@@ dge about it .
he is just as happy to have done what he did .
he received the crowds of awards from fans .
he is such a great guy and a family father .
he is a hero for his children and his wife .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ge@@ off said to me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; If I should be sm@@ itten by anyone , then I am glad that it is Isaac . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and I think Isaac would have felt the same if they had sw@@ apped the roles .
America Nin@@ ja War@@ ri@@ or has been extended for an A@@ ral Season , the shooting will begin in spring 2016 .
Detroit tig@@ ers pass past Minn@@ es@@ ota T@@ wins
MIN@@ NE@@ AP@@ O@@ L@@ IS@@ --@@ The second half of the season was not very funny for the Detroit tig@@ ers .
once they were one of the best teams in bas@@ eball , today the Tig@@ ers are at the last place in the American League Central .
the tig@@ ers are reduced to their role as spo@@ iler , but played this part perfectly on Tuesday against Minn@@ es@@ ota T@@ wins with 5 @-@ 4 in the target field .
the T@@ wins lost a chance to climb within one half of Houston Ast@@ ros for the second American League Wild@@ card position .
for Detroit , although only for one evening , it was a return of the three letters F @-@ word that was so hard to grasp over a large part of the second half of the season .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all victories make fun , no matter how it comes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Tig@@ ers manager Brad Aus@@ m . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
tiger @-@ Pit@@ cher Al@@ fre@@ do Simon maintained his early offensive support when Detroit scores three times in the first two Inn@@ ings , then once in the sixth and then once again in the ninth .
Simon ( 13 @-@ 9 ) proposed 6 times in the 1 / 3 Inn@@ ings and enabled three R@@ uns .
it was only his third successful start in his last nine games .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I want to end this year strongly , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Simon said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it &apos;s hard to throw in each game in the bul@@ l@@ fight , and therefore I want to get concentrated in the game .
the designated tiger @-@ Hit@@ ter Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z had three hits and was in two ranks , his first R@@ BI@@ s since mid @-@ August .
it was the first three hit game of Mart@@ ine@@ z since he had four hits against Seattle Marin@@ ers on July 6th .
&quot; he has sw@@ ung out the stro@@ kes , &quot; he said .
he looked good at the ( punch ) , clearly better looked out of the bul@@ l@@ pen , and he brought it straight into the game .
with three R@@ uns at the end of the seventh interior the T@@ wins had their best chance to get back into play again .
center Fiel@@ der By@@ ron Bu@@ x@@ ton finished the inning with a double on the left field line .
right Fiel@@ der Aaron Hi@@ cks reached a Bun@@ t , and Simon brought his second bass man Brian Do@@ zier to the Stri@@ ke@@ out before it was replaced by the left @-@ handed Bla@@ ine Har@@ dy .
Har@@ dy over@@ ran wall , the only man with whom he was confronted , in front of the designated R@@ ook@@ ie drummer Miguel S@@ ano , who had a two @-@ run escape from the right @-@ handed Dre@@ w Ver@@ hagen .
with a pair of runners and the final run on the second , Ver@@ hagen brought the third bass man Tre@@ vor Pl@@ ou@@ ffe to a double play .
it was the 27th time in the major league this season that pl@@ ou@@ ffe hit a double play
after Detroit added an insurance @-@ run at the end of the ninth inn@@ ings , wall created a R@@ BI @-@ double against the C@@ loser of the Tig@@ ers Bruce Ron@@ don and achieved the stand of 5 @-@ 4 .
however , the right @-@ handed mast S@@ ano out of three Pit@@ ches for its fifth save .
Detroit benefited from the start of the game from an even non @-@ moving Phi@@ l Hu@@ gh@@ es .
the tig@@ ers achieved three R@@ uns in the first two inside against the right @-@ handed veter@@ an who had been painted before the game from the vulner@@ ability list after having missed more than a month because of a spinal cord .
&quot; obviously not the beginning I desired , &quot; Hu@@ gh@@ es said , &quot; but I felt more comfortable when I started and felt that I would create some pretty good pit@@ ches in the third inning . &quot;
after receiving the Le@@ ad@@ off @-@ B@@ atter , Hus@@ him gave a single to Second Bas@@ eman Ian Kin@@ s@@ ler .
a Two @-@ Out Walk for J.@@ D. Mart@@ ine@@ z brought Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z to play a single &quot; up the middle &quot; at the first run of the game .
Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z managed his 0 @-@ 21 series of success with the runners in the scor@@ ing position .
the third bass player Nick Castell@@ an@@ os followed with a single on the right , managed another run , but Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z was thrown out of the game when he tried to get to the third , which ended the threat .
the tig@@ ers placed on the second , achieved a one @-@ out double by Cat@@ cher James Mc@@ C@@ ann and a Two @-@ Out single from Center @-@ Fiel@@ der Anthony GO@@ SE to 3 @-@ 0 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was a big blow , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said T@@ wins @-@ Manager Paul Mol@@ it@@ or . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he wasn &apos;t particularly well beaten , but he got the right place .
Hu@@ gh@@ es was in a pitch Count , scored no points in the third inning before it was replaced by the reli@@ ever right @-@ handed A.@@ J.@@ A@@ chter .
Hu@@ gh@@ es came to three hits with six hits and a walk with four stro@@ kes .
remarks : Tig@@ ers R@@ HP Ani@@ bal San@@ che@@ z retired due to a violation of the throwing school .
he is examined by Dr. James Andre@@ ws who operated the San@@ che@@ z Sh@@ oul@@ der in 2007 .
San@@ che@@ z , since mid @-@ August on the vulner@@ ability list due to a shoulder joint , is to be activated for launch on Wednesday .

Isch@@ inger : German military action in Syria an option
the Director of the Munich Security Conference , Wolfgang Isch@@ inger , holds military measures with German participation in Syria for an opportunity .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think the decisive reflection on military action options must not take place without Germany , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he accused the European states of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; collective fashion shows &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
four years ago , one was glad that the ch@@ ali@@ ce passed by a military participation in Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now the conflict is facing our door@@ step , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in Deutschl@@ and@@ funk . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the former German ambassador in Washington also called for a massive increase of international aid to refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Austria controls on southern and eastern borders
after Germany , Austria has again introduced controls to its southern and eastern borders .
Joh@@ anna Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner , Austrian Minister of the Interior , announced on Tuesday evening in Austrian broad@@ ca@@ ster ORF , no @-@ one will be sent back to Hungary .
Germany too did not send back refugees to Austria .
&quot; no , it &apos;s so agreed , &quot; she explained .
according to an agreement in which Germany could take up a certain number of refugees from Austria per day , Mik@@ l Leit@@ ner said that there have already been discussions between the Director General for Public Safety and representatives of Germany .
she did not call her concrete figures and pointed out talks on Wednesday in Berlin .
during the last days tens of thousands of refugees came to Austria via the so @-@ called Balkan Route .
their goal is mostly Germany .
Chancellor Angela Merkel ( CD@@ U ) and her Austrian colleague Werner F@@ ay@@ mann requested a special summit for next week together with several other EU leaders .
Germany started on Sunday with temporary border controls .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the EU states have so far not been able to agree on joint action in the crisis . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the EU interior ministers want to take a new approach to the binding distribution of another 120@@ ,000 refugees on Tuesday ( 22 September ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in view of the strong refugee camp in Germany , the federal government wants to support the countries in the initial up@@ take and distribution of people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the federal government will manage this together with the countries , and on the late Tuesday evening , Merkel announced after almost four hour consultations with the Prime Minister in the Chanc@@ ellery in Berlin .
Merkel under@@ lined that those people who need protection would get this too .
but those who don &apos;t have a retro@@ spective can &apos;t stay in Germany either .
this view was unanim@@ ously shared in the round .
the chan@@ cell@@ or stressed that the state as a whole must now cope with a &quot; huge effort . &quot;
thousands of desperate refugees are now stuck on the Balkan route .
Hungary closed its 175 @-@ kilomet@@ re @-@ long border to Serbia on Tuesday night .
a few hours later the government announced in Budapest to lock the border with Romania with a fence .
this neighboring country is different from Serbia to the EU .
Hungary &apos;s foreign minister , Peter S@@ zi@@ j@@ jar@@ to , said to the planned new border fence . Hungary wanted to prevent tu@@ g@@ boats depar@@ ting from Romania , said Hungary &apos;s Foreign Minister Peter S@@ zi@@ j@@ jar@@ to .
the Romanian government immediately condemned the plan .
there were first ar@@ rests of people who had cut the fence .
in Turkey , according to e@@ ye@@ witnesses , thousands of other migrants reported on the way to the Greek border .
spatial son@@ de &quot; Cass@@ ini &quot; finds ocean on Satur@@ n@@ mond En@@ cel@@ a@@ dus
under the iron p@@ anz@@ er of the Satur@@ n@@ monds En@@ cel@@ a@@ dus , a global ocean sw@@ aps .
this includes researchers from observations of the spatial son@@ de &quot; Cass@@ ini . &quot;
accordingly , the moon di@@ ets easily on its orbit around the ring planets .
although this de@@ af movement is only small , but still too large for a solid cel@@ esti@@ al body , it is said in a message from the Corn@@ ell University in I@@ th@@ aca ( US State of New York ) on Tuesday .
the researchers present their analyses in the journal &quot; I@@ car@@ us . &quot;
it was already known that there must be liquid water under the ice cover of En@@ cel@@ a@@ dus .
in 2006 , &quot; Cass@@ ini &quot; already discovered ice volcan@@ oes at the South Pole of the Satur@@ n@@ monds , sp@@ itting water vap@@ or and ice particles and thus feeding the so @-@ called E @-@ ring of Saturn .
at least on the South Pole , there must be an underground sea , the astronom@@ ers closed at that time .
however , the expansion of the hidden ocean was not clear .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is hard for us , R@@ ama is a bitter loss . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course , we must think now , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Sports Director Nec@@ at Ay@@ gü@@ n the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bild &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; newspaper with a view to the possible commitment of a seamless professional . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

no diet fruit - man@@ goes contain lots of sugar
man@@ goes are exotic and juicy @-@ sweet .
but he who wants to pay attention to his slim line is often rather dis@@ cour@@ aged by them .
man@@ goes contain relatively high sugar - especially su@@ c@@ rose .
the exotic fruits are healthy nevertheless : they contain B vitamins and vitamins E and C. In particular , man@@ goes contain a lot of vitamin A and its prec@@ ursor beta @-@ carot@@ ene .
those who eat the fruits thus support vision , immune system and metabolic processes in the body .
when buying , man@@ goes should not be too soft or too strong and smell pleasant .
the peel color alone says nothing about how ripe the fruit is - so also green man@@ goes can taste delicious .
they should be stored at room temperature and eaten within a few days .
then they taste pure or in sweet foods .
a man@@ go also gives hear@@ ty dishes a special note .
it allevi@@ ates the slightly bitter taste of some leaf salads as Chi@@ cor@@ ee and Ra@@ dic@@ cio .
and a Man@@ go@@ ch@@ ut@@ ney fits well with fish , poultry , lamb and game .
the UPS parcel service UPS returns up to 9@@ 5,000 hel@@ pers for the Christmas business in the USA .
the company has already begun to recru@@ it seasonal workers , UPS announced on Tuesday .
especially drivers are looked for .
already last year , UPS had raised its workforce for the holiday season by 9@@ 5,000 hel@@ pers .
in view of the bo@@ oming online business , UPS and its rival F@@ ed@@ Ex have been making arrangements for the Christmas business since last year .
in 2013 delayed deliveries had submitted harsh criticism to the parcel services .
first fo@@ aming tower , then prominent cold front
in the coming night , in the valleys of the Alps side of the F@@ öhn winds through , as Met@@ e@@ o@@ Switzerland announced on Tuesday .
on Wednesday and in the night to Thursday , the hair @-@ dryer blows partly with a storm @-@ strength through the fo@@ eh@@ n valleys .
after F@@ öhn@@ ende on Thursday morning a prominent cold front crosses us , which brings strong rainf@@ alls , wind gu@@ sts and a temperature decline .
as Met@@ e@@ o@@ News writes in a message , Switzerland is currently on the front of an extensive low @-@ pressure area above the British Is@@ les in a strong southwest current .
on the side of the Alps , the f@@ öhn winds through the valleys on the night .
in the wake of the F@@ öhn wind up to Thursday morning in the F@@ öhn@@ valleys with bends from 60 to 100 km / h , isolated and especially in the Ur@@ ner@@ land partly also with over 100 km / h .
the hair dryer can reach the adjacent middle ground in some places , and even hur@@ ri@@ cane @-@ bu@@ cks of over 120 km / h are possible on the mountains .
while in the north on Wednesday , stor@@ my hair dri@@ es for summer temperatures of 23 to 27 degrees , the humidity begins to st@@ ow at the mountain slope .
here rain sets in , which lasts until Thursday evening .
in total , in the next 48 hours , over 100 liters of rain per square meter must be calculated south of the Alps in the next 48 hours , which has already fallen into large rainf@@ all over the last days .
on Thursday morning the f@@ öhn winds out the air , as a result , a cold front rolls with a strong , partially t@@ wit@@ ched rain from west to east via Switzerland .
together with the cold front the wind refres@@ hes strong to stor@@ my , and temperatures go back considerably .

Rome now has a Martin Luther Place
almost 500 years after the Reformation , there is now a Martin Luther Square in Rome .
in the presence of Mayor Ign@@ a@@ zio Marino , a nam@@ eless place in the park on the O@@ pp@@ io hill was christ@@ ened on Wednesday in the name of the German Reform@@ ator .
in the &quot; Piazza Martin Lu@@ ter@@ o &quot; he is now honoured as the &quot; German The@@ ologi@@ an of the Reformation . &quot;
the park is located in the middle of the old Rome next to the Col@@ os@@ se@@ um .
the nam@@ ing was requested by the Association of Protestant Churches in Rome .
Jens @-@ Martin Kr@@ use , pastor of the Evangel@@ ical Lutheran Church in Rome , reminded the Wednesday that Protest@@ ants in the city of Pop@@ es could only live in secret their faith for centuries as a minority .
with the place I become visible in a symbolic way that the tradition of Christian faith in Rome is welcome .
Martin Luther ( 14@@ 83 @-@ 15@@ 46 ) was a young August@@ inian mon@@ k at the turn of the year 15@@ 10 / 11 a few months in Rome .
he felt the city at that time as a perfect be@@ ak .
according to histori@@ ans , his negative impressions are likely to have reinforced him in his later struggle against Rome .
Luther had then initiated the division of the oc@@ ci@@ dental church with his theses on the decline of the Ab@@ las@@ h@@ el .
hammer Artist invested three years in the personal interpretation of the Bible
Jesus with the gold @-@ gold crown is one of the main works that Ot@@ mar Alt has painted for his Bible .
Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost has written the introduction and updated Bible texts .
at the beginning was the Word ?
no , not at the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Bible , which has now appeared with splendid images .
at the beginning was the picture for Ot@@ mar Alt , who put in 150 motifs his very personal interpretations of biblical stories on paper and canvas .
his &quot; language &quot; with colorful colors and imagin@@ ative forms has received the 75 @-@ year @-@ old - but what is by no means syn@@ onymous with &quot; funny &quot; pictures .
on the contrary : adapted to the respective themes , it can be quite dark .
Ot@@ mar Alt has been working on his bi@@ ble project for about three years , for which he has made a subjective and artistic selection from the many subject areas of the book of all books .
these are cycles that dev@@ ote themes such as cross @-@ path , pl@@ agues , bi@@ ds , or fa@@ ther@@ land .
he was fascinated by several partners spontaneously : this applies to the Luther @-@ Verlag with its the@@ ological orientation as well as for the Kettler publishing house with its focus on art books .
and there is mainly the author Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost , who has dealt with the respective Bible passages on the basis of painting .
he interpreted the biblical passages selected by Ot@@ mar Alt and translated into current relations today . &quot;
these texts are like verbal mirrors of Al@@ ts painting .
they are embedded between the original Bible quotation of Martin Luther and one set of the artist , who formulated his very personal thoughts about the situation here .
the jewelry cord has golden letters .
thus , the 75 @-@ year @-@ old permits a deep insight into his soul , his emotions .
this is a high degree of in@@ timacy .
emotions were ultimately the trigger for the Bible project : Ot@@ mar Alt , born 1940 in Wer@@ ni@@ ger@@ ode and grew up in Berlin , comes from a family that belonged to the strict Protestant Herr@@ n@@ hu@@ ter Order .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since the up@@ bringing was already done with the cane , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ot@@ mar Alt rec@@ alls . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I tried to work out to be able to bear with the Lord again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his second concern is to revi@@ ve art in the quick@@ est time : &quot; the perception of image worlds is today shaped by advertising , and that is loud .
symboli@@ sm is displaced .
artists have a different pleasure and pleasure to show things .
pictures always have something mysterious and are not decorative .
&quot; in this respect I am a din@@ osau@@ r . &quot;
Ot@@ mar Alt wants viewers to &quot; fall into the images , &quot; to let them work , discover and sense what power they have : &quot; the image is looking for its counterpart . &quot;
Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost was standing on Tuesday at the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Stiftung ( Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Stiftung ) in the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Stiftung , &quot; I have always been &quot; a lover of Ot@@ mar Al@@ ert &apos;s art : &quot; I like how he understands life with his paintings . &quot;
old did not pay attention to cap@@ turing the Bible completely , but chosen the most important , mysterious themes for him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was not a collaboration at eye level , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Alt@@ ep@@ ost : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; here it is about the pictures , the text only explains . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for Hans M@@ öh@@ ler of Luther @-@ Verlag , this work is an invitation to deep@@ en his life and find freedom . &quot;
Ot@@ mar Al@@ ts &apos;s pictures speak for M@@ öh@@ ler both the biblical language of love and the responsibility .
a part of the origin@@ als - paper and canvas images - will be presented for the first time in an exhibition opened on November 15 in the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Stiftung .
start of construction for BM@@ X train
plans made , place found , company commissioned to model earth moun@@ ds for a round course : one year later , almost everything was ready - but before the official opening of the BM@@ X train it was finished again .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; om@@ is@@ sions in politics and administration provided for dr@@ unk@@ enness , especially among the residents who did not want to tolerate the railway . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
so hill dig@@ ging up , new place sought - now with formal planning and application for building permission .
the approval will go down in October , and the First Community member Sabine Mos@@ eb@@ ach @-@ Bo@@ ck has now been able to communicate in the children and youth committee .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I hope that this year will happen again , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it should then be started without a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; further &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pause &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the work of the former indoor swimming pool . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
DF@@ B intensi@@ fies commitment to refugees
the DF@@ B extends its commitment to refugees by 2019 , and Bundes@@ lig@@ a marks a clear indication on the weekend .
football re@@ acts to the situation in Germany and safegu@@ ards politics with its help in tackl@@ ing the problems encountered .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I consider this for the biggest challenge of our country since re@@ unification . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no one can say , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it doesn &apos;t matter to me , I have nothing to do with it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this must interest everyone to get a grip on this issue , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said DF@@ B boss Wolfgang Ni@@ ers@@ bach . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the annual meeting with German Chancellor Angela Merkel on 23 September in Berlin he wants to discuss the refugee situation in Germany intensively .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am in the chan@@ cell@@ or &apos;s office next Wednesday and meet the state minister Mrs. Ö@@ zo@@ ğ@@ u@@ z and the chan@@ cell@@ or . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there will certainly be a central role in the issue , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he announced . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
football can and will help .
but the decisive turn@@ out must be the policy .
for this reason , the German Football Federation has expanded its refugee initiative &quot; 1 : 0 for a welcome &quot; for four years .
&quot; over the E@@ gi@@ di@@ us @-@ Braun Foundation , we have ensured that this programme will continue until 2019 , &quot; stated Ni@@ ers@@ bach on the fr@@ inge of the UEF@@ A meeting in St. Julian &apos;s / Malta .
some federal states also support this program .
already on this weekend , the 36 pro @-@ associations place a clear sign when they will help the print &quot; We help - # Refu@@ ge@@ es@@ Welcome &quot; instead of the usual sponsor@@ ship logo ( Her@@ mes ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we also want to make it clear that everyone should help where and how they can , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Le@@ verk@@ us@@ ens Sports Chief Ru@@ di Völ@@ ler of the &quot; Bild &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; newspaper ( Tuesday ) and described the project as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; self @-@ evident . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the refugee drama goes on everyone , nobody can see it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we can use our jet power , our influence and our possibilities to help the many refugees who have suffered so incredibly , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Her@@ tha @-@ Manager Michael Pre@@ etz . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
H@@ offen@@ heim &apos;s managing director Peter Ret@@ tig spoke of a &quot; prominent sign of the League . &quot;
the national team of women invites 100 refugees to Halle / Sa@@ ale for the European Championship play against Hungary on this Friday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ni@@ ers@@ bach called the support of refugees as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a large community of German football . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
that all 36 license agreements had started their own projects were great .
just as great is that small and smallest clubs are active .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the message &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 1 : 0 for a welcome &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we spent is living in football . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is of enormous importance , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in this and the next year , the association with the DF@@ B selection and the German federal government provides 300@@ ,000 euros for the integration of refugees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the clubs have also called up the whole sum for 2015 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ni@@ ers@@ bach reported . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
reports : SAP CEO loses eye on accident
the head of the board of Europe &apos;s largest software group , Bill Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t , has been reported to have lost the left eye due to a fall in early July .
in the accident on the stairs in the house of his brother in the USA he fell on a water glass after midnight , which he carried in his left hand , reports the &quot; economic week &quot; on Wednesday .
&quot; he is almost bleeding , power@@ less , then dra@@ gged out on the road - he told us this last week , &quot; quoted the &quot; Wi@@ Wo &quot; SAP co @-@ founder Has@@ so Platt@@ ner .
but Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t could pursue his work .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the beginning of October , we meet before the Supervisory Board meeting in Wall@@ dorf , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Platt@@ ner said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the 54 @-@ year @-@ old manager is at the meeting and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fully working . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t announced in an interview with the &quot; Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung &quot; ( Thursday edition ) , he will come back to Germany in October and continue to lead the software company .
&quot; I &apos;m full for SAP , full in my job . &quot;
&quot; of course I stood in regular contact with the Supervisory Board and its chairman Has@@ so Platt@@ ner , &quot; said Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t the &quot; S@@ Z . &quot;
Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t usually comm@@ utes between Germany and the USA , but since summer he was no longer in the German SAP headquarters in Wall@@ dorf .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is important to him to go to the public with such a personal story , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; S@@ Z , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; can happen . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is important to stand up again if you have fallen . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mc@@ L@@ aren replacement pilot Magn@@ us@@ sen except Battle ...
Magn@@ us@@ sen t@@ wit@@ tered a photo and explained that he suffered the injury when he was over@@ thrown by the wheel .
it therefore comes as little as reserves for the two Stam@@ mp@@ il@@ otes Fernando Al@@ on@@ so and J@@ ens@@ on Button in Singapore on the weekend as a week later at the Grand Prix of Japan .
S@@ occ@@ er : Bv@@ B without Re@@ us vs K@@ ras@@ no@@ dar : wil@@ der in the gate
at Bor@@ ussi@@ a Dortmund , all hopes for a com@@ eback from Marco Re@@ us have finally broken in the first group game of the Europa League .
the national player will also be missing the championship leader of the Bundes@@ lig@@ a in Du@@ eling with the F@@ K K@@ ras@@ no@@ dar on Thursday ( 19 : 00 / Sky ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; unfortunately , we cannot fall back on it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Thomas Tu@@ ch@@ el on Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
whether Re@@ us will be back on Sunday at the Bundes@@ lig@@ a Top@@ spiel against Le@@ verk@@ usen , the BV@@ B @-@ Coach left open : &quot; we expect a return from him to the training on Friday . &quot;
in view of the high load of his pro@@ s , Tu@@ ch@@ el will not only change his core elf in the Re@@ us position .
he was thus announc@@ ing a change in the door@@ way position .
this is why Roman Wei@@ den@@ f@@ eller takes the place of master crafts@@ man Roman Br@@ ki .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he trains at an absolute top level , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; praised the World Teacher . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , if Wei@@ den@@ f@@ eller is used in all Europa League games in the future , Tu@@ ch@@ el remained open .
with high probability he will also play the second game .
the for@@ sche statement by Mit@@ player Re@@ us that the final suit for the BV@@ B in the Europa League should be the goal , mid @-@ field player Julian W@@ eig@@ l holds for understandable : &quot; thus Marco is not that wrong . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think we have a good chance to take the title . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
robot cars : government plans leadership role for Germany
according to the will of the Federal Government , Germany should be a technological pioneer in changing the car .
on Wednesday , the Federal Cab@@ inet decided on a strategy paper from the House of Transport Minister Alexander Do@@ brin@@ dt ( CS@@ U ) , which includes investments in the expansion of digital infrastructure .
Do@@ brin@@ dt talked about a &quot; new mobility era &quot; on Wednesday in Frankfurt on the edge of the Autom@@ esse IAA .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; automated and connected driving will increase road safety and ensure less traffic , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Do@@ brin@@ dt said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he also wants to discuss the subject with his colleagues from the G@@ 7 states , who come together with representatives from the industry at the IAA .
the strategy paper of the Ministry of Transport also emphas@@ ises the importance of mobile broad@@ band expansion and rapid growth on digital radio signals .
a test track on the motorway 9 in Bavaria is currently being tested for testing new technology .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so that the driver &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no additional liability risks are raised , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Federal Government wants to check the legal framework &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and , where necessary , adapt to the new developments . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for example , Germany wants to use international standards to ensure that the maximum speed for self @-@ prop@@ elled cars is increased from 10 to 130 kilometres per hour .
the Federal Government also wants to apply for a change in the Vienna Convention , which so far only sees the human being as a driver .
in automated driving , the car is increasingly taking the lead , the driver gets more and more to the passenger .
the technology is based mainly on sensors and cameras that capture the environment and process data in seconds .
according to a study presented by the Ministry of Economy , highly automated driving on motor@@ ways by 2020 will be technically possible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nevertheless , dri@@ ver@@ less vehicles on public roads are &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not to be expected until 2020 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the value added in the field of driver assistance systems and highly automated driving functions in Germany is estimated by the authors of the study for 20@@ 25 to around 8.4 billion euros .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the digital networking of passenger cars can lead to greater safety and efficiency in road traffic , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said SPD traffic politi@@ cian S@@ ören Bar@@ to@@ l . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , the question of liability in case of accidents and the safety of the personal data of the drivers must be clearly clari@@ fied .
however , the Germans are still looking skep@@ tical - much more than French or Americans .
a survey conducted by the For@@ sa Institute on Wednesday at the AA Commission on behalf of the testing organization Dek@@ ra conclu@@ des that only eight percent of Germans believe that autonomous driving cars will prevail over the next ten years , 32 percent count only in 20 years with it , 31 percent do not believe in it at all .
in France , 21 per cent of the respon@@ dents count to 20@@ 25 with autonomous driving cars , 33 per cent in the US .
anyway , drivers in Germany are not yet ready to rely completely on a self @-@ prop@@ elled vehicle .
following a survey by the digital association Bit@@ kom , only seven percent would agree to give the control over the entire journey on all roads .
at least 15 per cent could be expected on the motorway , 45 per cent in traffic .
a good every fourth would leave the car under no circumstances .
B@@ oll claims team and double start at table tennis Euro
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Dus@@ sel@@ dorf wants only to hit the cover at the title fight from September 25 to October 4 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the final decision is to be made at the latest on September 22 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a huge loss for our team . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the boys experienced it in the morning . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but we are strong enough to get the title even without Timo , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bun@@ de@@ builder Jörg Ro@@ ß@@ kopf during the European Championship in Düsseldorf . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
B@@ oll was at that time on the flight to a long @-@ term sponsor@@ ship in China .
the 34 year old German champion is expected back on Friday .
&quot; without Timo is the down@@ side , we are no longer such a clear favourite , &quot; says Ein@@ zel @-@ Europ@@ am@@ ei@@ ster Dimit@@ ri@@ j Ov@@ t@@ char@@ ov .
the Ham@@ el@@ ner , who leads the S@@ etz@@ list in Y@@ ek@@ ater@@ in@@ burg , also rec@@ alled the European Championship in Sch@@ wech@@ at .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at that time , Timo also lack@@ ed and we became European champion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; in this we should ori@@ ent ourselves , &quot; declared the fifth fifth .

Gau@@ l@@ tier feels too old for an En@@ f@@ ant terrible
it is a mixture of a very large fashion show and a wax figures show cabinet : the designer Jean Paul Gau@@ l@@ tier ( 63 ) presented an exhibition on his work on Wednesday in Munich .
the highlights : display mannequins , which look horri@@ bly human thanks to video projections .
they carry the spectacular creations of the French designer , who , among other things , became the big star of the fashion scene with Mad@@ onn@@ as &apos;s stage out@@ fits - and that he put men in skir@@ ts .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today I can no longer say that I am the En@@ f@@ ant of the Haute Cou@@ ture because I have white hair . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the past it was ble@@ ached , now it &apos;s real , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gau@@ l@@ tier said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for the visitors of the exhibition &quot; From The Side@@ walk To The Cat@@ walk &quot; ( From the side@@ walk to the cat@@ walk ) , which is to be seen in the Kunsth@@ alle of the Hyp@@ o @-@ Kultur@@ stiftung from 18 September at the Kunsth@@ alle of the Hyp@@ o @-@ Kultur@@ stiftung , it is a good thing that the fashion designer has changed his attitude towards a show of his person .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for me an exhibition sounded a bit after death , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
when you die , you come to the museum .
the impressive collection had previously been made in Montreal and Paris .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is about so much more than just beautiful dresses , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the director of the Kunsth@@ alle , Roger Di@@ e@@ ders . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is about tolerance , acceptance and vision of an open society .
the exhibits give an insight into the hardly surprising work of the man who has written fashion history without ever having completed an apprenticeship .
chron@@ ologically , the show is not structured , but it is a super@@ bly choreograph@@ ed Gesamt@@ kunst@@ werk , for which much effort was done : to indul@@ ge d@@ olls , for example , a sty@@ list has been engaged .
according to the cur@@ ator Thierry @-@ Maxim@@ e L@@ ori@@ ot sent 14 tons of material to Munich .
just before the start of the Oktober@@ fest there was still a special treat : a le@@ der@@ h@@ osen outfit with cor@@ set .
Hei@@ di meets Madonna .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he has always been interested in strong women ( &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; women are smar@@ ter than men &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) and for people who are a bit different , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gau@@ l@@ tier said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
also Gau@@ l@@ tiers old Ted@@ dy can be seen in the exhibition .
he stands for the first , tent@@ ative fashion attempts of the designer .
as a child ( he was not a good student and bad in football ) he put on his Ted@@ dy B@@ H@@ s and clothes , Gau@@ l@@ tier said .
his parents would not have allowed him to play with a doll .
he later taught the dis@@ appearance of fashion himself .
he st@@ ole fashion magazines and looked at the designs of other designers as Gau@@ l@@ tier said in Munich .
later I bought them , but of course I bought them .
for his first own fashion show he did not have to pay the models .
they did not get anything , but they were allowed to keep the clothes .
jewellery instead of curtain - P@@ lau@@ dry top as fashion niche
in the past it went to the long embroi@@ dery machines in and around P@@ lau@@ en to make meters .
the embroi@@ dered fabrics and spi@@ kes were produced in large quantities for customers , for example , for blankets and she@@ ers .
this alone is no longer working , says Andreas Rein@@ hardt , managing director of the Mo@@ eb@@ itze P@@ lau@@ en .
instead , fashion is important again .
in the early times of the P@@ lau@@ en lace fashion played a major role , was then displaced by the home textile industry - and is now re@@ discovered as a niche .
Rein@@ hardt names some examples : lace in jewelry , accessories such as bags and regional costumes .
in general , the so @-@ called vintage fashion , which leans on past styli@@ stic periods , is an increasing order potential .
those who do not use niche in the textile branch in Germany are no longer on the market .
with us , they already have half of all orders .
together with nine other companies , Mo@@ eb@@ itze P@@ lau@@ en is a member of the branch association P@@ lau@@ ener Spitze and embroi@@ dery .
only they may wear the protected label .
over the last 15 years , around 80 percent of sales have been broken away .
there is almost no more private shops and wholesale trade .
our products hardly reach our customers in this way .
today , the mass @-@ commodity is produced much cheaper in the Asian region and is sold almost exclusively via chains .
in addition , exports are weak@@ ening , currently in Russia and in the United States .
there are enough reasons for new ways .
the industry association also tries to score points with environmental awareness , as C@@ ord@@ ula Bauer explains by the embroi@@ dery in Fal@@ k@@ enstein : &quot; this year we have a quality seal that shows that we produce ec@@ ologically and socially acceptable . &quot;
Rein@@ hardt compl@@ ements : &quot; this applies to the materials used . &quot;
diploma designer U@@ te Schmidt is teaching at the Schne@@ e@@ berg branch of the West@@ sächs@@ ische Hochschule Z@@ wick@@ au - at the Faculty of Applied Arts - special@@ ising in embroi@@ der@@ ies and lace .
in order to counter@@ act competition from the Asian region , it is necessary to find high @-@ quality and innovative products .
this takes time and courage .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is a tension field between the fresh@@ est ideas of designers and the companies that need to think economically , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Schmidt . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
therefore , an existing design is often only slightly varied to keep a customer base .
some years ago , textile designer Kat@@ i Reu@@ ter re@@ invented the historic snow@@ ball peak .
the machine sn@@ aps small chi@@ cks in some places .
the P@@ lau@@ ener gol@@ ds@@ mi@@ thing master@@ in Bianca Hal@@ leb@@ ach @-@ K@@ rau@@ ße took inspiration from this : &quot; before , I could not start with traditional P@@ lau@@ en lace . &quot;
now she uses the snow@@ ball tip for her jewelry .
in a complex procedure it shapes the pattern in silver .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many people in the region identify with the topic of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; P@@ lau@@ ener &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - young and old , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Reu@@ ter says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it also supplies in the USA , to Australia and Finland - especially to customers whose ancestors lived in P@@ lau@@ en and its surroundings and who would like to have a mem@@ ento .
with this I see my jewellery as the modern ambassador of the P@@ lau@@ ener tip .
Disney plans new &quot; Mary P@@ opp@@ ins &quot; movie
legends are not to be touched , but Disney nevertheless vent@@ ures to a new film of his classic &quot; Mary P@@ opp@@ ins . &quot;
according to &quot; Entertainment Week@@ ly , &quot; however , it is a kind of continuation that takes 20 years after the first movie with the magical child girl .
it is about the experiences of N@@ anny with the B@@ anks family during the world economic crisis in England .
anyone who plays P@@ opp@@ ins more than 50 years after Ju@@ lie Andre@@ ws is still unclear .
but the director already stands firmly : Ro@@ b Marshall , recently with &quot; In@@ to the W@@ oods &quot; at the cinema .
XI aims to open the economy wider for the world
the economy has to open wide out@@ ward to promote growth , President X@@ i J@@ in@@ ping said on Tuesday of a group that was commissioned with the reform of the reform .
&quot; China should focus on attrac@@ ting foreign investments and know @-@ how and improving the strategies for business start @-@ ups , &quot; he spoke in a speech at the 16th session of the Central Executive Committee for the deep@@ ening of a comprehensive reform .
promoting new start @-@ ups and driving forward reforms will bring about new momentum and vitality and offer new space for economic growth , X@@ i said .
the management group has adopted a number of guidelines including a negative list to control the market access , relaxation of border controls policy , promotion of state enterprises ( SO@@ E ) , to include private capital , and over@@ haul the population reporting system .
according to the statement , a negative list is created , which identifies sectors and companies that are not eligible for investments .
the system is tested gradually and improved by test programs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the initiative is important since it as@@ signs a major role to the market in the allocation of resources , guarantees a legal business environment and open the market more open , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the statement . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the government will also lo@@ osen controls on the powers transferred to the companies and ensure that companies decide how to conduct their business . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the statement also said that China will allow border areas to explore new models of cross @-@ border economic cooperation and new mechanisms to promote regional growth .
as part of an offer to open state controlled sectors , further areas are opened for private investment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the government will not change its policy towards foreign investments and will protect the legitimate interests of foreign @-@ financed companies and provide better services for them , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the statement . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition , it is easier for foreigners to apply for a permanent residence permit or &quot; Green Card &quot; by optim@@ ising the requirements and making the application process easier .
to guarantee the right of lawyers to exercise their activity , and to use professional judges and prosec@@ ut@@ ors , was also discussed at a meeting .
at the meeting also Premier Li Ke@@ q@@ i@@ ang and important leaders like Li@@ u Y@@ un@@ sh@@ an and Z@@ hang Ga@@ oli attended , as reported in a statement published after the meeting .
EU wants to double mercury limit in pre@@ dat@@ ory fish
the European Commission wants to double the limit values for mercury in large car@@ ni@@ vor@@ es and to increase the dose of the nerve damage to consumers .
the consumer organisation F@@ ood@@ watch , which has a corresponding EU workplace , critic@@ ised the plans : &quot; risks and side effects of failed industrial and environmental policy are passed on with full force to pregnant women and infants , &quot; explained Matthias Wolf@@ sch@@ midt of F@@ ood@@ watch .
according to Wolf@@ sch@@ midt , the limit values of the nerve poison for large fish at the end of the food chain such as shar@@ k or s@@ wor@@ d@@ fish are to be raised from one to two milli@@ grams of mercury per kilogram of fish .
however , large pre@@ dat@@ or fish are already so heavily loaded with mercury , that on the basis of the still valid limit values , about 50 per cent of the cat@@ ches may not be sold .
after dou@@ bling the limit values , only 14.@@ 5 percent would be in@@ conceivable .
according to F@@ ood@@ watch , the EU wants to intensi@@ fy the limit values for other fish from currently 0.5 milli@@ grams to 0.1 milli@@ grams of mercury per kilogram .
F@@ ood@@ watch , however , described this as a &quot; trick &quot; because smaller c@@ emet@@ eries such as car@@ p are usually so low stressed that they are already adher@@ ing to the planned maximum values already today .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the lowering of Kl@@ einf@@ o is therefore &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a per@@ fi@@ de distra@@ ction that helps the economy alone , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wolf@@ sch@@ midt . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
mercury is a heavy metal which is highly toxic to humans , which is strongly enriched by the food chain mainly in pre@@ dat@@ ory fish .
the German government therefore warns that &quot; low amounts of small quantities can cause damage to the nervous system in particular .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Federal Environment Ministry declares on its homepage with regard to the valid maximum values , however , that a &quot; health hazard to the general population &quot; is not to be expected .
mercury is mainly caused by coal combustion in the environment .
according to a written information from the Federal Ministry of the Environment , the German coal @-@ fired power plants meet more than six tonnes of mercury in the year , two @-@ thirds of the total amount of the total amount in Germany .
the concentration of mercury in fish such as Elbe , Rhine and Danube was &quot; permanent and nationwide sur@@ passed , &quot; the &quot; Spiegel &quot; quoted from the paper in March .
last year , Europe @-@ wide warnings of mercury in fish are already among the most commonly reported health risks in the EU warning system RA@@ S@@ FF .
