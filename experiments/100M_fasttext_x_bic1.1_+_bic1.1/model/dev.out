Obama receives Net@@ any@@ ahu
the relationship between Obama and Net@@ any@@ ahu is not friendly .
the two wanted to discuss the implementation of the international agreement as well as on Te@@ hr@@ an &apos;s dest@@ abili@@ zing actions in the Middle East .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the meeting , however , it is also intended to deal with the conflict with the Palestinians and the two @-@ state solution discussed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the relationship between Obama and Net@@ any@@ ahu has been ten@@ se for years .
Washington critici@@ zes Israel &apos;s continuing settlement construction and repro@@ aches Net@@ any@@ ahu for lack of will in the peace process .
the Obama &apos;s wor@@ sen@@ ing deal for the Iranian nuclear program has deterior@@ ated the relationship between the two .
in March , at the invitation of the Republi@@ cans in front of the US Congress , Net@@ any@@ ahu held a controversial speech that was part of an aff@@ ront to Obama .
the speech was not discussed with Obama , a meeting was rejected with reference to the election that was im@@ min@@ ent at that time in Israel .
Professor to have shot his girlfriend in an emergency call
in an emergency call Professor Sh@@ ann@@ on Lamb spoke with a somewhat c@@ unning voice of the police that he shot his girlfriend and that the officials would have to come to his house .
lamb was important to emphasize that his &quot; sweet dog &quot; was still alive and probably excited , and he said the family contacts of the dead woman could be found on the cell phone .
inside the house , the officials found the cor@@ p@@ ses of A@@ my Pr@@ enti@@ ss and a hand@@ written note scri@@ b@@ bled on a white blo@@ c : &quot; I am sorry I wanted it to und@@ o , I loved A@@ my and she is the only woman who ever loved me . &quot; this was according to the authorities in the letter , and he was signed by Lamb .
there was no indication that Lamb , who taught in two on @-@ line courses for Delta State University in Cle@@ vel@@ and , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , had already traveled to the school grounds for 300 miles . according to the police , he shot a popular history professor , E@@ than Schmidt , at the door to his office and killed .
Delta State University Poli@@ ti@@ ff Lyn@@ n Bu@@ ford said that university staff members heard the shooting at 10 : 18 .
he said that Lamb made the fatal emergency at some point afterwards .
until the end of the day there was another death : the Lamb took the life when the police tied him .
a day after shooting at the university , forcing students and lec@@ turers to hide behind closed doors , the authorities still try to get a picture of what Lamb has motivated .
the details published by the investig@@ ators at both ends of the state , as well as what students and staff who knew him helped to draw a picture of a talented but possibly difficult teacher .
students said they were looking forward to his teaching .
the Gau@@ tier police , where Pr@@ é@@ ss died , said he has no history of violence or criminal background .
Schmidt himself had mentioned Lamb in a book written by him in which he mentioned the &quot; wonderful people &quot; with whom he shared his academic life .
both taught in the Department of Social Sciences and History , whose faculty includes 17 members , and many students visited courses of both .
at the same time there were some tendencies towards problematic behavior .
a student , Brand@@ on Be@@ a@@ vers , who praised Lamb , said he seemed a little nervous and nervous , &quot; as if something was wrong with him . &quot;
another student , Mik@@ el Sy@@ kes , said that he told him that he had to deal with stress at the end of the academic year 2014 @-@ 15 .
lamb before had asked the Delta State University for health reasons and said he had any health problem .
this year he taught only two online courses .
the latest changes in the university &apos;s employment policy meant that the promotion for which Lamb had worked so hard for him would not be a guarantee of an automatic way to employment as Assistant Professor .
President William La@@ For@@ ge said he didn &apos;t know anything about a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt , but &quot; of course there was something in Mr Lam@@ bs &apos;s performance . &quot;
these are questions that Lamb cannot answer any more .
after the escape from the campus , the police found Lam@@ bs later , when he went back to Miss@@ issi@@ ppi from Ar@@ kan@@ s@@ as .
before he could be arrested , Lamb killed himself with a .@@ 38 cali@@ ber gun in the back@@ yard of a house about a mile south of his childhood home on the outskirts of Green@@ ville , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , said Washington County Cor@@ oner Hav@@ el Johnson .
his car still ran in the dri@@ ve@@ way .
it was not immediately clear why he went to this house , but Johnson said that she believes that he knew the people who lived there .
lamb grew up in the area .
Lamb started his work at the university in 2009 , which has 3,@@ 500 students in a city with approximately 12@@ ,000 inhabitants and taught ge@@ ography and pedago@@ gy .
he completed his doc@@ torate in education in the spring .
one of the many years of friendship he described him as intelligent , charism@@ atic and funny .
Car@@ la H@@ air@@ ston said she was 15 and lamb was 20 when they met through mutual friends .
she and her friends were in the High School , and he was the cool older guy who tried several years to teach her the guitar .
he was the s@@ warm of women at that time .
all the girls melt away when he was there , &quot; H@@ air@@ ston said , now 40 and living in Jackson &apos;s subur@@ b of Brand@@ on .
lamb and Pr@@ é@@ ss were obviously some time together .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in emergency call Lamb &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I killed my wife , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but there was no certificate from a marriage . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they had a dog called Light@@ ning who lived with them in the brick house adjoining a ba@@ you in Gau@@ tier .
the police said that the dog was fine .
the ex @-@ husband of Pr@@ enti@@ ss , Sha@@ wn O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said they were divor@@ ced 15 years ago , but had stayed friends and had a daughter who was 19 years old now .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she was totally destroyed by the ground , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en about his daughter . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
she and her mother were absolutely best friends .
O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said he never met Lamb , but by his daughter Ab@@ ig@@ ail he heard that Lamb was interested in music and played blues .
lamb met Pr@@ ent@@ ss , when he and Ab@@ ig@@ ail performed both on a summer fair three years ago .
later they played together the one or the other gig .
O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said his daughter writes and sings their own music .
Pr@@ é@@ ss was a nurse who worked for various companies online .
Mike Sha@@ ffer , a bark@@ e@@ eper and sometimes entertainment coordinator at The Ju@@ le@@ p Room , a poorly lit bar near Gau@@ tier , said that he saw Lamb and Pr@@ enti@@ ss Night at night 5 . September for the last time after Lamb had finished his guitar and dial@@ ect game before a spar@@ se audience .
there were no signs that something was wrong .
&quot; just a happy couple , &quot; he said .
we were sitting up and jo@@ king together .
I mean they both had a good sense of joke .
Schmidt , the dead professor , led the first semester seminar program and specialized in American indigenous peoples and colonial history , said Don Allan Mit@@ ch@@ ell , an English professor at the school .
he was married and had three little children .
he studied at the Empor@@ ia State University in K@@ ans@@ as and was president of his bro@@ therhood and student committee .
on Tuesday evening about 900 people attended the Delta State Campus in Cle@@ vel@@ and , including lec@@ turers , employees , students and members of the congregation at a cand@@ l@@ eli@@ ght memorial service .
Sch@@ mid@@ ts &apos;s wife Li@@ z and his brother Jeff Schmidt joined the Mah@@ n@@ wache , while the Univers@@ it@@ or &quot; B@@ right Mor@@ ning Star &quot; and Ama@@ zing Grace sang .
the lessons will be resum@@ ed on Wednesday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we try to move our students back to return , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said La@@ For@@ ge . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the crisis is over .
this is a day of healing .
A@@ my and Ro@@ geli@@ o Soli@@ s reported from Cle@@ vel@@ and , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi .
associated Press authors E@@ mil@@ y Wag@@ ster P@@ ett@@ us in Green@@ ville , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , and Rebecca Sant@@ ana in New Orleans contributed to this report .
this story was corrected to reflect that the police now says that Lamb had the emergency call after he shot Schmidt , and that Lamb had described Pr@@ enti@@ ss as his wife in his emergency call , but there is no indication that the two have ever got married .
go @-@ Toys R Us plans to hire fewer workers for Christmas time
toy R Us says that it won &apos;t be as many Christmas season employees as last year , but the toy and baby products dealer says that he will give the currently employed staff and seasonal workers a chance to work more hours .
the company stated that it plans to employ 40,000 people in stores and sales centers throughout the country . in the Christmas season 2014 , 45@@ ,000 workers were hired .
most jobs will be part @-@ time jobs .

as the holidays are still months away , the Christmas business is getting closer and companies are preparing to hire time workers to equip shops with employees who sell , send and deliver products .
Michael J. Fox j@@ okes about his &quot; Date &quot; with Princess Diana
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the premiere of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Back to the Future &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was a great moment for Michael J. Fox . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was also remarkable for personal reasons .
&quot; we sat in the theater waiting for the ro@@ y@@ als , and I notice that the seat is empty next to me , and it gradually becomes clear to me that Princess Diana will sit next to me , &quot; he said in a trailer for an upcoming documentary &quot; Back in Time . &quot;
the film begins , and it comes to mind that I am a simul@@ ated y@@ awn and an arm @-@ length of it to be with the princess of Wales on a date .
&quot; back in Time , &quot; a documentary about &quot; Back to the Future , &quot; presents interviews with Fox , Le@@ a Thom@@ p@@ son and Christopher Lloyd as well as with director Robert Z@@ em@@ eck@@ is and producer Steven Spiel@@ berg .
&quot; back for the Future &quot; premi@@ ered 30 years ago .
&quot; it really is for me , &quot; said Spiel@@ berg , &quot; un@@ str@@ it@@ ably the biggest time travel film ever filmed . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; back in Time &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; will be shown on VO@@ D , DVD and selected movie the@@ aters in October . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
UN leader says there is no military solution in Syria
Secretary General B@@ an K@@ i @-@ moon says his response to Russia &apos;s enhanced military support for Syria is : &quot; there is no military solution &quot; of the almost five @-@ year conflict , and more weapons will only wor@@ sen violence and misery for millions of people .
the UN chief again calls on all parties including the shared UN Security Council to unite and support inclusive negotiations to find a political solution .
B@@ an said at a press conference on Wednesday that he plans to meet the Secretary of State of the five permanent member nations of the Council - US , Russia , China , Great Britain and France - on the fr@@ inge of the minist@@ erial meeting of the General Assembly still this month to discuss the situation in Syria .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he regre@@ ts that the spl@@ its in the Council and within the Syrian people and the regional powers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; make this situation in@@ soluble . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; B@@ an called on the five permanent members to show the same solidarity and unity in Syria in overcoming the nuclear deal with Iran . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
8 poll@@ s showing that Donald Tr@@ ump is serious .
some tried to brand him as a flop .
others have dismissed him as a joke .
and some are waiting for a collapse .
but no matter how some Republi@@ cans try to pull Donald Tr@@ ump from the top ranks in surveys down@@ wards , it hasn &apos;t worked ( yet ) .
ten of the last eleven national surveys revealed Donald Tr@@ ump in the double @-@ digit range , and some begin to seriously ask what it means to the odds of nom@@ in@@ ating the real estate mo@@ gul@@ s .
of course , it is still too early in the election period .
nobody claims that Tr@@ ump is likely to win the Republi@@ can nom@@ ination .
experts emphasize that at that time , in 2011 , Rick Per@@ ry &apos;s leadership was given to the rising Her@@ man Cain , none of whom won only one state in the nom@@ ination process .
and there are many reasons why he would have to fight in a general election .
but out@@ si@@ ders like J@@ eb Bus@@ h@@ s Super PA@@ C and the conservative economic group Club for Growth now recognize dr@@ um@@ ps staying power and start to drop their dollars to t@@ opp@@ le it .
here are some current survey values indicating that the real estate mo@@ gu@@ l is not just a temporary phase :
Tr@@ um@@ ps Pop@@ ular values have turned 180 degrees .
shortly before Donald Tr@@ ump announced his can@@ did@@ acy in mid @-@ June , a survey conducted by Mon@@ mouth @-@ University demonstrated that only two of ten Republi@@ cans saw the real estate mo@@ gu@@ l positive .
by mid @-@ July , it was 40 percent .
at the beginning of August there were 52 percent .
now six out of 10 Republi@@ cans have a positive view of Donald Tr@@ ump .
about three out of ten say they have a negative opinion .
and these figures are held in early states .
a Qu@@ in@@ ni@@ pi@@ ac vote in I@@ owa reported last week that 60 percent of the Republi@@ cans have a good opinion of Tr@@ ump .
two thirds of GO@@ P @-@ vot@@ er GO@@ P would be happy with Tr@@ ump as candidates .
in a CN@@ N / OR@@ C pol@@ l last week 67 percent of the Republi@@ cans said they were either &quot; delighted &quot; or &quot; satisfied &quot; when Tr@@ ump would be nominated .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; only two of ten say they would be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; anno@@ yed &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if he were the candidate . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
only Ben Car@@ son creates about the same enthusiasm as tr@@ ump ( 43 per cent say they were &quot; excited &quot; vs. 40 percent who say the same about tr@@ ump ) .
the next in terms of enthusiasm ?
Marco Ru@@ bio with just 21 percent .
on the other hand , 47 percent of the Republi@@ can voters say that they would be &quot; dis@@ satisfied &quot; or &quot; anno@@ yed &quot; if J@@ eb Bush , the favorite of the establishment , would be the candidate .
a majority of the Republi@@ cans see Tr@@ um@@ ps Temper@@ ament as a problem .
while Donald Tr@@ ump is widely critici@@ zed for his bom@@ b@@ astic and offensive statements , 52 percent of Irish voters ten@@ ding to the Republi@@ cans believe that the real estate mo@@ gu@@ l has the right temper@@ ament for a president , so ABC News / Washington Post on Monday .
the same number is valid in the nation &apos;s first pres@@ election state , the state of I@@ owa , where the same 52 percent of the Republi@@ cans think that he has the personality for a commander @-@ in @-@ chief , according to Qu@@ in@@ ni@@ pi@@ ac last week .
nevertheless , 44 percent think that he does not have the personality to perform his office effectively , and almost six out of 10 In@@ depend@@ ents say that his tem@@ per does not fit into the White House , so ABC / Post .
Republi@@ can voters get used to the idea .
if they impose their rever@@ ence hats , Republi@@ can voters hold Tr@@ ump for real .
if they are asked who would most likely win the GO@@ P nom@@ ination , after a CN@@ N / OR@@ C survey last week , four out of ten say that Tr@@ ump is the best bet .
this is a change since the time that four from ten end of July put their money on J@@ eb Bush .
complete disclosure : GO@@ P voters did not have the clear@@ est crystal ball in the past .
at this time in the last cycle , four out of ten Republi@@ cans thought that Rick Per@@ ry would win the nom@@ ination by just 28 % for the final candidate Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney .
nevertheless , a large number of GO@@ P voters can see Tr@@ um@@ ps Camp@@ aig@@ n as plau@@ sible .
even if the Republi@@ cans gathered around another candidate , Tr@@ ump sums up almost everyone .
some experts point out that the fragmented field probably contributes to tr@@ um@@ ps management , while the anti @-@ Tr@@ ump support is spread to more than a dozen other candidates .
but a survey conducted by Mon@@ mouth University in early September shows that in a hypo@@ the@@ tical head @-@ an @-@ head @-@ race between Tr@@ ump and most other Republi@@ can candidates , Tr@@ ump re@@ aps the majority support .
he has 13 points ahead of Car@@ ly Fi@@ or@@ ina , ahead of Marco Ru@@ bio 14 points , ahead of Walker 15 points , before J@@ eb Bush 19 points and finally before Rand Paul , John Ka@@ sich and Chris Christi@@ e 33 points .
it is a head @-@ to @-@ head @-@ race with T@@ ed Cruz .
the only candidate who beats him ?
Ben Car@@ son would over@@ take the entrepren@@ eur with 19 points in a hypo@@ the@@ tical head @-@ to @-@ head race .
a scar@@ ce majority of Donald Tr@@ ump fans say they have formed their mind .
a new survey by C@@ BS / NY@@ T on Tuesday shows that only a little more than half of voters support Tr@@ ump saying they have firmly given their votes .
of course , much can happen to change that , and no one can really say , never change the mind .
46 percent said they left the door open to change to other candidates .
nevertheless , Tr@@ um@@ ps is the strongest competi@@ tor at the moment of other out@@ si@@ ders , the neuro@@ surgeon Ben Car@@ son , but voters who say they have formed their mind are twice as common for tr@@ ump .
six out of 10 Republi@@ cans say that they agree with Tr@@ ump on immigration .
since Donald Tr@@ ump in his election campaign before two months ago , immig@@ rant from Mexico called &quot; rap@@ ist , &quot; was the immigration and fishing point in the public discourse for 2016 .
some are worried that the bom@@ b@@ astic expression of Tr@@ ump will hold decisive His@@ panic Americans from the Republi@@ can Party and will damage the re@@ orientation efforts .
but after the new ABC / Post @-@ survey on Monday , six out of 10 Republi@@ cans say that they agree with Tr@@ ump on immigration issues .
so long as the immigration is in the li@@ mel@@ i@@ ght , it seems that Donald Tr@@ ump seems to do .
the fru@@ stration of the government climb@@ s to new levels .
meanwhile , Donald Tr@@ ump and Ben Car@@ son account for about half the support of Republi@@ can voters , especially their out@@ si@@ ders status .
six out of 10 Republi@@ cans say in the new Mon@@ days pol@@ l of ABC / Post , they rather want a political out@@ sider than someone with government experience .
and they are angry at Washington too .
a survey conducted by Des Mo@@ ines Register / Blo@@ om@@ berg in I@@ owa two weeks ago shows that three of four I@@ owa re@@ public@@ ans are frustr@@ ated by the Republi@@ cans in Congress , with 54 percent &quot; un@@ satisfied &quot; and 21 percent &quot; in@@ fer@@ nal . &quot;
Munich , Sy@@ lt and Co . : the five most exclusive residential areas in Germany
the most expensive housing estate - with a view of the North Sea att .
in the street , a square meter of a single roof house costs 7@@ 3,@@ 300 euros .
&quot; on Sy@@ lt , the supply of objects is naturally limited , &quot; says it in the study - therefore the high price .
a new study shows in which special layers a square meter costs the most .
of course , 18,@@ 70 euros per square meter for a student bust in Munich are not really little .
in contrast to Germany &apos;s top residen@@ ces , however , one of the prices comes as Pe@@ an@@ uts .
the real estate service provider angel &amp; Völ@@ kers has published a ranking of the most exclusive German residential locations - with square meter prices in di@@ zz@@ ying heights .
there are several tens of thousands of Euros - per square meter , well @-@ noticed .
but good , who can afford it ...
by the way : Munich is not at the top here as an exception .
champi@@ ons League : Bavaria dream start thanks to Müller and Götz@@ e
a double cake in Pi@@ ra@@ eus : Bavaria @-@ Star Thomas Müller has just one run .
a happy hit by Thomas Müller gave the FC Bayern the way to a deser@@ ved 3 : 0 at Olympi@@ ac@@ os Pi@@ ra@@ eus - then it ran .
a sovereign pr@@ el@@ ude to the Champions League season .
world champion Thomas Müller and Mario Götz@@ e have received a dream start in the &quot; Mission Milano &quot; in the Hex@@ enk@@ essel of Pi@@ ra@@ eus .
the team of Trainer P@@ ep Guardi@@ ola took their kick in the Champions League at the Greek record champion Olympi@@ ak@@ os in hot atmosphere thanks to Müll@@ ers double pack ( 5@@ 2nd / 90@@ . + 2 ) and i@@ dol hits ( 8@@ 9. ) ear@@ ns at 3 : 0 ( 0 : 0 ) .
the twel@@ fth tournament success in series will be the first step towards the final on May 28 , 2016 in Italy , where Guardi@@ ola finally wants to catch the H@@ enk@@ el@@ pot@@ t to Munich in the third attempt .
Müller received good assistance from Olympi@@ ac@@ os @-@ Tor@@ wart Roberto in the Champions League in the Champions League to the Bayern leadership , who allowed a shot of the world champion as a flan@@ k .
&quot; we will not under@@ estimate them , &quot; Bayern @-@ captain Philipp L@@ ah@@ m promised hot @-@ bloo@@ ded fans in front of the game at the Kar@@ ais@@ k@@ ak@@ is Stadium before 31.@@ 6@@ 88 - and the Munich @-@ based word .
they showed a concentrated and committed performance without shining .
Pi@@ ra@@ eus had won his most recent six home games in the top class , including some famous clubs such as Manchester United , At@@ l@@ é@@ tico Madrid or Ju@@ vent@@ us Turin .
in 2011 Bor@@ ussi@@ a Dortmund also stum@@ bled ( 1 : 3 ) .
but the Bav@@ arians , un@@ defeated in seven European @-@ up du@@ els with Greek teams , did not want to be the next victim .
they went cour@@ age@@ ously , but often too in@@ ventive in their offensive efforts .
the attacks were introduced too often on the left @-@ hand side of Douglas Costa , which was rarely passed through the former O@@ mar El@@ ab@@ d@@ ell@@ a@@ ou@@ i from the former Braunschwei@@ ger O@@ mar El@@ ab@@ d@@ ell@@ a@@ ou@@ i .
Müller had more luck from the right than his flan@@ k from the right half @-@ field hit the left upper tor@@ ment .
in the 6@@ 7th minute the world champion for@@ gave the possible 2 : 0 .
Robert Lew@@ and@@ owski had the best opportunities in half a year .
first , when Olympi@@ ac@@ os @-@ Stür@@ mer Ideal @-@ Brown kno@@ cked the Pol@@ es head ball from the line ( 26 . ) .
then by direct debit , the go@@ al@@ keeper Roberto was par@@ ked with the knee ( 35 . ) .
although the Bav@@ arians had become accustomed to the dominant play , Pi@@ ra@@ eus could make con@@ i@@ fers .
but on door@@ keepers Manuel Neu@@ er was reli@@ ance .
for example , when he drew a shot of ide@@ o@@ y over the Lat@@ te ( 5@@ 6th ) .
before Neu@@ er ordered Guardi@@ ola to defend a four @-@ chain with David Al@@ aba in the center next to Jer@@ ome Bo@@ at@@ eng , which made it well .
Mario Götz@@ e , after muscular problems back in the ca@@ der , was sitting outside .
the World Cup hero was given the green light only after the final training , &quot; said sports management Matthias Sam@@ mer at &quot; Sky &quot; : &quot; if you want to make something different from it , this is already malign@@ ant . &quot;
at the first change , Guardi@@ ola decided against him when he brought King@@ sley Com@@ an to Lew@@ and@@ owski ( 59@@ . ) .
i@@ dol was late for Ar@@ tur@@ o Vi@@ dal ( 7@@ 6. ) and made it clear 13 minutes later , Müller made a difference .
in front of the game it had come to Kra@@ w@@ alle in the stadium .
after a smaller group of war@@ med Bayern fans apparently provoked Pi@@ ra@@ eus &apos; followers with words and gest@@ ures , the security forces attacked and attacked the Munich supporters .
at least one Bayern @-@ Fan was injured from the stadium .
smo@@ kes , has a higher risk of losing teeth
who smo@@ kes , har@@ ms not only the lung , but also the teeth - that suggests a Potsdam long @-@ term study .
the good news : if you do so , the risk is reduced quickly .
smo@@ kers have a much higher risk of losing their teeth early .
this results from the long @-@ term study of an international research team , including several employees of the German Institute for Food Research ( DI@@ f@@ E ) in Potsdam .
compared to non @-@ smo@@ kers , smo@@ kers had the risk of losing their teeth pre@@ mat@@ urely in order to increase the 2,@@ 5@@ - to 3,@@ 6 times higher .
the scientists observed more than 23,@@ 300 participants .
main causes for tooth decay are cavi@@ ties and inflammation of the gum , emphasizes the DI@@ f@@ E .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for these perio@@ don@@ ti@@ tis , smoking is a risk factor , emphas@@ ising the authors . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the relationship between smoking and tooth loss is therefore reduced to more frequent gin@@ gi@@ vi@@ tis in smo@@ kers .
it is not clear to what extent smoking increases the risk of c@@ aries .
people who stopped smoking could reduce their risk but within a short time , the researchers write in the &quot; Journal of Dental Research . &quot;
however , it could take more than ten years until the endanger@@ ing again sin@@ ks to the level of non @-@ smoking , first author Thomas Dietrich from the English University of Birmingham .
one must convince people not to become non @-@ smo@@ kers , explained study manager H@@ einer Boeing from DI@@ f@@ E : &quot; smoking reduces the lifetime . &quot;
not smoking is good for lungs and vessels and according to our findings also leads to good dental health until high age .
in Germany over 20 percent of the population in the age of 65 to 74 years are affected by tooth@@ lessness , the DI@@ f@@ E shared .
earlier studies have already pointed out that smoking increases the risk of early tooth loss .
the new long @-@ term study under@@ lines the findings .
archae@@ ologists kno@@ ck on the rem@@ n@@ ants of the L@@ ate Anti@@ quity in Cologne
archaeological findings have been made on the right bank of the Rhine in Cologne for the repeated time .
in the vicinity of the construction site for the new Rhine bou@@ levard archae@@ ologists of the Roman @-@ German@@ ic museum have excav@@ ated skel@@ et@@ ons and remains of historical buildings , said Museum Director Marcus Trier on Tuesday .
since the beginning of construction works on the Rhine , histori@@ ans are searching for so @-@ called soil monuments .
for all building projects in the city district of Cologne , the museum is always referred to as the Department of Archae@@ ological Natural Monument Care .
in the third construction phase of the Rhine Boulevard , archae@@ ologists have now found five .
from text documents had already been known that at the place in the 4th century a fortress and in the 8th century a church stood , Trier explained .
in addition to rem@@ n@@ ants of the fortress and the church tower , a cemetery with around 350 graves had been discovered , which probably belonged to the church .
young woman captured from freight train
after a young woman is caught up in the train station in the direction of vul@@ tures , the Federal Police asks the people to help .
on the early Wednesday morning at 1.@@ 40 o &apos;clock the woman crossed the railway station at the end of the platform and was captured by a freight train coming from Mön@@ ch@@ eng@@ lad@@ bach .
due to the acquisition of the train , it has carried the most serious injuries to the Federal Police .
she was treated to a hospital by emergency and brought to hospital by rescue workers .
there are no findings on the grounds of the ni@@ gh@@ tly cross @-@ crossing of the young woman .
the incident was probably observed by witnesses or residents have heard acoustic percep@@ tions .
there are residents or p@@ asser@@ s @-@ by by Lin@@ der@@ ner train , brick bakery , Thom@@ as@@ hof@@ straße and Lei@@ ff@@ ar@@ ter Straße ( L@@ 3@@ 64 ) .
notes stating the cause of the accident can be placed under the telephone 0@@ 800 / 6@@ 88@@ 8000 or any other police station under 24 / 7 .
European Commission proposes new court in dispute on TT@@ IP
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the European Commission proposed comprehensive reform of the current arbit@@ ration system for the determination of the dispute over the planned Trans@@ atlan@@ tic Trade Agreement ( TT@@ IP ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the disputed private arbit@@ ration institutions for disputes between companies and states should therefore be replaced by a more transparent system , which in its functioning corresponds to considerably more traditional courts .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to establish a system that citizens dare , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the responsible EU Commissioner Ceci@@ lia Malm@@ ström during the performance . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Swe@@ de proposed introducing the proposal as a European negotiating position in the Free Trade talks with the US . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the German government announced support .
TT@@ IP will be the world &apos;s largest free trade zone with 800 million people .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the plans for reform of the current arbit@@ ration proceedings stipul@@ ate specifically that the EU states and the US jointly choose independent judges for a new court of investment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they should come to equal parts from the EU , the US and third countries . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a second instance is fores@@ een for the first time .
it would allow obj@@ ections to be lod@@ ged against jud@@ gements .
until now , the parties involved agreed with each other on refer@@ ees ; there was no obj@@ ection to their judgments .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the recent months &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; discussion of the past few months , it has become clear that citizens did not trust the old IS@@ DS system in fair@@ ness and justice , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Malm@@ ström . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the long term , it wants to work towards an International Investment Court according to its own specifications .
there , for example , disputes between Chinese companies and EU states could also be clari@@ fied .
the investor @-@ state arbit@@ ration proceedings ( IS@@ DS ) , particularly demanded by major corporations , are considered one of the main reasons for the major opposition in Europe against TT@@ IP .
the traditional arbit@@ ration tri@@ bun@@ als are critici@@ zed by opponents as a kind of parallel justice that the tax@@ pay@@ ers are able to pay compensation , national legislation , or reduce consumer and environmental standards .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the first comments , anti @-@ TT@@ IP organizations such as Camp@@ act described the proposals of the European Commission as inadequate . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
above all , it was critic@@ ised that they should not apply to the already negotiated Free Trade Agreement with Canada ( C@@ eta ) .
the German state secretary , Matthias Mach@@ nig ( SPD ) , on the other hand , described the plans as a great advance .
the Commission considered important points in the reform that the Federal Minister for Economic Affairs , Sig@@ mar Gabriel , worked with other EU trade ministers in the spring .
the old system of private arbit@@ ration courts is from the table .
the French government also welcomed the plans of Malm@@ ström .
the European business association B@@ US@@ IN@@ ES@@ S@@ EURO@@ PE warned against restric@@ ting the economic action of the economy by too many new rules .
especially small and medium @-@ sized enterprises could be dis@@ advant@@ aged in this way .
when the talks on the TT@@ IP free trade agreement ( Trans@@ atlan@@ tic Trade and Investment Partnership ) can be concluded , it remained unclear on Wednesday .
negotiations have been running since mid @-@ 2013 .
so far , however , the issue of investor protection has not been discussed with the US .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; originally , a framework for the agreement should be at the end of this year . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this date counts as un@@ sustainable .
delicious Folk of Su@@ f@@ jan St@@ ev@@ ens in Hamburg
eleven years ago Su@@ f@@ jan St@@ ev@@ ens is on stage in the Cologne Prime Club ( today : Lux@@ or ) .
next to him is a fli@@ p@@ chart , on which the timi@@ d folk singer has recorded the picturesque US state Mich@@ igan with felt @-@ pin .
the entire audience , about 40 people , is almost captured by St@@ ev@@ ens &apos;s lecture .
he tells the story of various places he always records on the map , about his meticul@@ ous and delicate arranged songs .
where they came from and how it looks there , in his homeland .
since then St@@ ev@@ ens has proven to be a wonderful creative Irish .
the 2003 and third album &quot; Gre@@ etings from Mich@@ igan : the Great Lake State &quot; will feature intellig@@ ently composed songs that blend harmon@@ i@@ ously close to American folk of the late six@@ ties , but can easily drift to great opul@@ ent styles at any time .
the rum@@ our arises , &quot; Mich@@ igan &quot; would be the first part of a bold series : each of the 50 U.S. states should be sung in a row .
but already in 2004 and near the Rhine , &quot; Seven Sw@@ ans &quot; has already been released and has a positive outlook on expectations .
St@@ ev@@ ens is reduced here .
live with him guitar and ban@@ jo .
a year later , the musician who lives in New York returns to the series .
with &quot; Illinois &quot; ( &quot; Su@@ f@@ jan St@@ ev@@ ens Inv@@ ites You To : come on Fe@@ el The Il@@ lin@@ oise &quot; ) a nationwide masterpiece is published in 2005 .
convincing ideas and styli@@ stic fin@@ esse .
the album entered the American Bill@@ board charts and is not missing in any yearly list of influential music media .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after a very productive experim@@ entation , St@@ ev@@ ens &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Age of Ad@@ ore &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( 2010 ) uses very extensive electronic components . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this sixth decent studio album is still broad@@ ly orchest@@ rated , but carried by programmed sequences or beats and plays with all sorts of effects and rever@@ ber@@ ation .
since the smaller clubs have long ceased , the stage shows are shown here for the colorful spectacle of ne@@ on head@@ bands and big lumin@@ escent stage decoration .
Su@@ f@@ jan St@@ ev@@ ens is currently touring Germany as a member of a five @-@ member band .
in the dark held Hamburg More !
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he mainly presents the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Car@@ rie &amp; Low@@ ell &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; available since March . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
even though nearly 2,000 guests are now ban@@ ished in their chairs , the clearly arranged St@@ ev@@ ens comes back to in@@ timacy and to folk .
without judging the audience , the group plays an excellent musician through the broad @-@ enriched album .
you hear from the audience : the lecture is &quot; opul@@ ent &quot; and you can basically throw away the &quot; plate . &quot;
only after an en@@ core , St@@ ev@@ ens would like to give thanks to himself , plays an acoustic few older songs and finally dec@@ lines under thunder@@ ous applause .
Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s debut at the Prime Minister &apos;s Fra@@ gment
since his election Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s debut is expected in the Prime Minister &apos;s frame of suspen@@ se
the new Labour leader Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ n will make his debut at the prime minister &apos;s frame and for the first time put on David Cameron .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n will rise to ask for the first of his six given questions shortly after noon , with his performance being examined by the media and the Labour MEPs from the neighbourhood .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he called for &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; less theatre and more facts &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at this weekly event . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he also said that he could skip some sessions to leave them to colleagues .
the meeting will be the first parliamentary review for Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s leadership , as it comes after his appointment as a member of the Shadow Cab@@ inet and after his speech at the TU@@ C Annual Meeting on Tuesday .
in the meantime , the Labour president &apos;s decision to remain silent on Tuesday at a commemor@@ ative ceremony commemor@@ ating the 7@@ 5th anniversary of the Battle of Britain in silence , has provoked a number of T@@ ory @-@ MPs and is at the heart of several header pages in the newspapers .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns &apos;s decision not to sing the national an@@ them has attracted attention
a spokes@@ man by Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said he was &quot; in respect@@ ful silence &quot; and he recognized the &quot; hero@@ ism of the Royal Air Force in the Battle of England . &quot;
but a member of Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s Shadow Cab@@ inet , O@@ wen Smith , told the Labour leader to sing the national an@@ them , &quot; irrespective of his belief that the monarchy should be aboli@@ shed .
almost a dozen of shadow ministers refused to serve in Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s top team , and they called for differences in the economy , defence and foreign affairs , while less than one sixth of the parliamentary party originally supported him as a leader .
the political correspon@@ dent of the BBC Robin Bran@@ t says that political differences can also be st@@ acking within the Labour , &quot; according to Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s statements on the position of the European Union and the limitation with profits .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said the TU@@ C conference that Labour &apos;s changes take place in order to remove the whole idea of a limitation .
hours later , Mr Smith , the shadow @-@ working and pension minister , said that the party was &quot; very clear &quot; that it was only against the government plans to lower the limit of 26@@ ,000 pounds to 23@@ ,000 pounds .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n will be the fifth Labour leader David Cameron since he is T@@ ory boss , over the dis@@ patch cabinet across the Parliament over the past decade .
the Labour leader who has promised another policy approach says that he has asked &quot; Crow@@ d @-@ sour@@ ced &quot; ideas for Mr Cameron &apos;s questions and gave him more than 30.000 suggestions .
the Is@@ lington North MP has said that the prime minister &apos;s question@@ ings are too confron@@ t@@ ational , and that he will refra@@ in from focusing on serious problems such as poverty , ine@@ quality and challenges for young people .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said that Angela Eagle , the shadow economic minister , will represent him if he does not participate - for example when Mr Cameron is travelling abroad .
he also spoke the idea that other colleagues would occasionally speak the word , and that he spoke to John Ber@@ cow , spokes@@ man for the lower house , to discuss the problem .
when he became a leader in 2005 , Mr Cameron said that he wanted to remove himself from politics in the style of a &quot; Ju@@ dy show , &quot; often associated with the prime minister &apos;s frame . but a few years later he admitted that he failed .
since it was first broadcast on television in 1990 , the findings with the Prime Minister were considered to be the most important bar@@ ometer of the judgment of a leader and his leadership in the House of Comm@@ ons and his position among his parliam@@ ent@@ arians , although critics have argued that they have become a car@@ ic@@ ature and require far @-@ reaching reforms .

pound grows through accelerated wage growth in the United Kingdom
the pound declined sharply to data showing an increase in the UK &apos;s wage growth . parallel to this , the FT@@ SE 100 was increased by the bid target of SA@@ BM@@ iller .
between May and July , earnings without bonuses in the UK grew by 2.@@ 9 % compared to the same period of the previous year .
this percentage has been the fastest and advanced estimates of the time of an increase in interest rates since 2009 .
the pound increased by more than 1 % against the dollar to $ 1,@@ 5@@ 50@@ 5 and was climbed by 0.@@ 84 % compared to the euro to € 1.@@ 37@@ 30 .
the FT@@ SE 100 index included an increase of 1.@@ 49 % to 6,@@ 2@@ 29@@ ,@@ 21 .
SA@@ BM@@ iller was the outstanding share in the market and made a 20 % jump after tak@@ eover offer of the Ri@@ val AB In@@ Be@@ v received .
a transaction would combine the world &apos;s two largest bre@@ wer@@ ies and bring together brands such as Bud@@ weiser , Stella Ar@@ to@@ is , Per@@ oni and Gro@@ l@@ sch .
Bur@@ berry shares were higher after encouraging news from the competition Group for luxury goods Rich@@ em@@ ont 0.@@ 9 % higher .
Rich@@ em@@ on@@ ts latest sales figures beat all expectations and also showed that sales in China - a key market for Bur@@ berry - reported growth again .
shares of Gl@@ en@@ core rose 5 % after the mining giant said he took 2.5 billion $ by a stock sales as part of his debt reduction strategy .
the shares of the packaging and paper company Mon@@ di were the biggest los@@ ers on the index , and with a decline of 4.3 % after Gold@@ man Sach@@ s had set his assessment for the company rating on &quot; sell . &quot;
J@@ D Sports increased by 3.1 % after the sports clothing company reported a pre @-@ tax result of 4@@ 6.@@ 6 million for the first half of the year .
the head of J@@ D Sports says higher wages end@@ anger the expansion .
the managing director of J@@ D Sports Peter Cow@@ g@@ ill says that a higher minimum wage for UK employees could mean &quot; more purchasing power in the pockets of potential customers . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but it is unlikely that this purchasing power will compensate for the higher labour costs for its company , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the cost could meet the expansion plans of J@@ D Sports , he added , and that could mean there are fewer additional jobs .
Jus@@ tin Bie@@ ber in the capital : on Bie@@ ber expedition in Berlin
Jus@@ tin Bie@@ ber , Meg@@ ast@@ ar .
9 years old , a rail@@ ing with a fat@@ eful f@@ rise .
the type with plat@@ inum bl@@ ond hair is 100 million euros heavy .
rather even more .
at present , Mon@@ si@@ eur Bie@@ ber is in Berlin .
and the Generation U@@ 17 is spinning .
like Vik@@ tori@@ a Ru@@ d@@ zin@@ ska .
the 15 @-@ year @-@ old has never heard the name &quot; R@@ itz Carl@@ ton . &quot;
not bad .
hundreds of fans accompanied Jus@@ tin yesterday .
including E@@ wa and Vik@@ tori@@ a from Poland .
since 7 o &apos;clock in the morning , however , the pol@@ in sits on the cold stone plates in front of the Berlin luxury hotel at Pots@@ dam@@ er Platz .
the construction of Bie@@ ber : here you live i@@ dol , whose posters hang on in Sz@@ cz@@ ec@@ in , since Monday evening .
the suite in which the Canadian singer lives , costs exactly as much as her mother E@@ wa deserves in half a year .
if at all .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she says , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; actually my Wi@@ k@@ tori@@ a would have to sit in the tenth class in the gymn@@ asi@@ um . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I fulfil her a dream . &quot;
compulsory scho@@ oling ?
who che@@ ers it ?
the fans don &apos;t .
not even Bie@@ ber himself .
it has already taken care of it anyway .
for publicity in the advertising break of the Super@@ market he cas@@ hed three million , a two @-@ year deal with an anti @-@ p@@ im@@ p company washed many , many dollars on the Bie@@ ber account .
and with every doll that looks like him and goes over the counter , Bie@@ ber also cas@@ ks .
when Jus@@ tin Bie@@ ber drinks a coffee , you are amazed at the window pane .
he is said to have explo@@ ded more than 100 million .
some say the hyp@@ e went too far .
others stress that Bie@@ ber is finally in the US and UK with his new single &quot; What do you mean ? &quot; at No. 1 .
Bie@@ ber himself , whose fourth album is to follow in November , are not interested in the many zer@@ os .
at least he does so .
PE@@ GI@@ DA poster brings Leban@@ ese to the idea of mas@@ hed potatoes
potatoes or twe@@ et@@ ers ?
it is both in the potato d@@ öner , which the Ol@@ den@@ burger I@@ mb@@ isi owner Han@@ i Al@@ ha@@ y developed .
inspired by the &quot; potato instead of D@@ öner &quot; on a plac@@ ard of the Pe@@ gi@@ da movement Al@@ ha@@ y potato and meat have put together on a sk@@ ewer .
the idea brought him a poster at a Pe@@ gi@@ da demonstration with the inscription &quot; Pot@@ atoes instead of D@@ öner , &quot; which he had accidentally seen on television .
since then , there is a barbecue in his shop , which is equipped with meat and potatoes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is multic@@ ul@@ ti for the stomach , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Al@@ ha@@ y . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Leban@@ ese government has meanwhile submitted the idea to the patent office in Munich .
according to the authority , it has recently been protected as a utility model .
as much meat and how much potatoes the sk@@ ewer contains , Al@@ ha@@ y does not want to betra@@ y .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; only as much : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it tastes better together , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he finds . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
culinary international understanding is also good for its customers .
met@@ cash La@@ un@@ ches Resources Camp@@ aig@@ n to Fi@@ ght Al@@ di@@ - In@@ vol@@ vement
met@@ cash is trying to protect the I@@ GA stores from an Al@@ di march in South Australia and Western Australia .
food wholes@@ aler met@@ cash has launched a floor@@ standing campaign to defend the market share of the I@@ GA retailers in South Australia and Western Australia in advance of a $ 700 million Al@@ di invasion .
while Al@@ di prepares the opening of two sales centers and the first 120 shops in South Australia and Western Australia early next year , met@@ cash and I@@ GA stores strengthen their relationships with local food suppliers and build the I@@ GA brand through mainstream marketing and marketing through social media , as well as events like Adel@@ ai@@ de @-@ Show .
Ig@@ A dealers and suppliers jump on board , with brands such as ice manufacturer S@@ immo from Dun@@ s@@ bor@@ ough , who distri@@ butes samples in I@@ GA stores and store shop@@ keepers who sell dis@@ counted tickets for the South Australian football league to loyal customers .
it is expected that Met@@ a will release further details of its defense strategy on September 29 , when the wholes@@ aler of food , alcohol and equipment performs its annual investor strategy day .
there is a lot in the game as South Australia and Western Australia accounts for almost 30 percent of Met@@ a &apos;s I@@ GA stores and generate higher profit margins as a Met@@ a &apos;s I@@ GA network in the eastern states .
buyers in South Australia and Western Australia have a much stronger market share than in New South Wales , Victoria and Que@@ ens@@ land - more than 30 percent in South Australia and 24 percent in Western Australia compared to around 14 percent in Western Australia .
however , analysts like Morgan Stan@@ ley believe that , twelve months after the opening of his first markets , Al@@ di will s@@ nat@@ ch around five percent of the food market in these two states and will take away all existing actors , but mainly independent retailers .
according to a report published this week , the analy@@ st Tom K@@ ier@@ ath of Morgan Stan@@ ley estimates that I@@ GA retailers could lose 360 $ million turnover per year and met@@ cash $ 250 million by the end of 2016 .
this pro@@ g@@ nosis is based on the assumption that Al@@ di in the next year will open 25 branches in SA and 30 in WA , and will generate revenues of $ 500 million and $ 600 million in each market .
the loss in food and food business and in the amounts of Met@@ a &apos;s high fixed cost base could cost met@@ a $ 13 million pre @-@ interest and tax profit , &quot; Mr K@@ ier@@ ath said .
at the same time , Met@@ a@@ cash loses market shares in the eastern states , mainly to Al@@ di and Col@@ es , although a recent survey by Roy Morgan found that I@@ GA buyers are the most loyal .
Morgan Stan@@ ley believes that Met@@ a &apos;s revenue in the food and food business will drop by 3.8 percent in 2016 , 4.1 percent in 2017 , and 2.1 percent in 2018 , and will reduce the market share of 14 percent in 2015 to 10.@@ 3 percent by 2020 .
last week , the leading fund manager Ham@@ ish Dou@@ glass , founder of the Mag@@ ell@@ an Financial Group , told in a business dinner in Melbourne that met@@ cash would likely disappear within a decade .
met@@ cash declined to publicly respond to Mr Dou@@ glass &apos;s comments .
but it is assumed that a board member of met@@ cash has contacted Mr Dou@@ glass last week .
since 2010 , i@@ G@@ AS market share has fallen from 18 percent to 14 percent , and revenues from Met@@ a &apos;s food and food trade , which supplies about 1,@@ 200 I@@ GA retailers , has fallen by 43 per cent since 2012 , reflecting operational debt reduction with simultaneous printing on sales and margins .
however , the wholes@@ aler resist@@ s and inv@@ ests more than $ 150 million in order to match sales prices with col@@ es and Wo@@ ol@@ wor@@ ths in hundreds of products each week and to improve I@@ GA retailers in improving their stores by faster growing fresh food and delivering a better choice of private label foods .
Met@@ a &apos;s principal business manager Ian Mor@@ rice says that the price adjustments and charging refur@@ bish@@ ment programs to El@@ an are expected to grow and hopes the wholes@@ aler will return to profit again in the year 2017 for the first time in four years .
Th@@ an@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is is supported by the president of the Australian tennis federation Steve He@@ aly
Th@@ an@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is deserves praise as criticism for his behaviour .
Th@@ an@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is was one of the &quot; coll@@ ateral damage &quot; in the recent storm around his friend Nick Kyr@@ gy@@ z and , according to the president of the Australian tennis federation Steve He@@ aly , deserves praise as criticism for his own behavior .
Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is , the younger of the talented Du@@ os , which is often referred to as &quot; Special K@@ s , &quot; came into the spotlight with the in@@ famous confrontation of Kyr@@ gy@@ z and St@@ an Wa@@ wr@@ in@@ ka at the Montreal Masters .
soon after that , in a fi@@ ery qualification game in C@@ inc@@ inn@@ ati , Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is and his opponent Ry@@ an Har@@ rison had to be separated twice by the refer@@ ee , where Har@@ rison cried out : &quot; W@@ wr@@ in@@ ka would have had to beat the child , and I should beat the child . &quot;
while he was recently seen how he sm@@ ashed a tennis ra@@ cket , after a cra@@ mp struck a potential US Open win by Richard Gas@@ quet , Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is was defended by He@@ aly .
the teen@@ ager is currently in Glasgow , competing with Sam Gr@@ oth in the second place behind Bernard Tom@@ ic in the Davis Cup semi @-@ fin@@ als against Britain .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one thing I am quite en@@ vious about is the fact that after my view , Th@@ an@@ asi was drawn into the argument , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said He@@ aly . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he has broken a ra@@ cket when he lost a cra@@ mp in the US Open , but he is not the first player who has broken a ra@@ cket from fru@@ stration with himself , and I know Th@@ an@@ asi good enough to know he is not proud of it .
but , really , he has beha@@ ved extremely well in the US Open , even in the rather pro@@ voc@@ ative circumstances with Har@@ rison and so on , and I think he deserves much recognition .
he has a great team around him , he has a great family around him , and I think he was treated a little too severely .
he is a very mature 19 @-@ year @-@ old , he works very hard and he has never had a problem with the other players , he has never had a problem with the other players , he is well in shape , he &apos;s a very stable and mature young guy , and I think he deserves to be judged by his own mer@@ its .
He@@ aly also supported the decision not to consider Kyr@@ gy@@ z at the important preliminary decision , which begins on Friday , and he describes the &quot; common decision &quot; as the right one for all , but he ass@@ ures the man from Can@@ ber@@ ra to return as a long @-@ term fixed component to the team . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; first , we want the team to be completely focused on the competition and not all the controversi@@ es around &#91; Kyr@@ gy@@ z &#93; , &quot; said He@@ aly .
and I think that Nick was very quick to get out of what people like Feder@@ er and Mur@@ ray indicated , and he has made some bad mistakes and deserves all the cri@@ tiques he gets , but we try to make him understand the consequences of his actions . some time outside the ramp where he can only think about it , I think it &apos;s best for the team and it &apos;s the best for him .
Europe &apos;s refugee crisis : Hungary explains emergency , closes the border , keeps refugees back
Hungary declared the emergency and eg@@ ed the southern border with Serbia on Tuesday and held all that tried to come illeg@@ ally to the country . all with the aim of stopping the influ@@ x of migrants .
chaos followed the border when hundreds of migrants gathered in a man &apos;s land and re@@ acted to Serbian officials with indignation .
the people who fled from violence got stuck for an unknown time in a strip of land on the road between the two control points of the countries and built tents and settled there .
but frustr@@ ations rose .
as a police helicopter ho@@ ver@@ ed over them , the migrants &quot; open the border ! &quot; and cried insul@@ ts against the Hungarian pro@@ visi@@ oning police .
some rejected food and water from protest .
Serbia &apos;s foreign minister said it was &quot; unacceptable &quot; that migrants were sent back from Hungary , while more and more came from Macedonia and Greece .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Serbia wants to be part of the solution and not a coll@@ ateral damage . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; talks with Brussels and other countries must take place in the coming days , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said I@@ vi@@ ca D@@ ac@@ ic in Prague . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the turbul@@ ence on the Hungarian @-@ Serbian border ended a day after the 28 @-@ Nations block at a disputed meeting in Brussels which could not agree on a common immigration policy .
however , the ministers agreed to share the responsibility for 40,000 people who sought refuge in the ou@@ tra@@ ged Italy and Greece . they expressed their hope that after the next month or by the end of the year , an agreement would be made that the EU states would accept another 120@@ ,000 refugees , including some from Hungary .
German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria requested a special summit of the European Union on Tuesday to discuss the immigration crisis of the continent .
however , Hungary did not put its hopes on a bal@@ eful action from Brussels or its neighbors .
the emergency room , which was run on Tuesday in two southern regions , gave authorities greater powers to tackle the crisis so that they could block roads and accelerate asylum procedures .
the Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter S@@ zi@@ j@@ jar@@ to stated that his country also planned the construction of a bar@@ bed wire fence along its border with Romania in order to stop the influ@@ x of migrants through the country - after finishing a fence at the Serbian border .
C@@ BS News correspon@@ dent Charlie D &apos;@@ Ag@@ ata reported that even prison in@@ mates were deployed in the race to create bar@@ bed wire fence between Hungary and Serbia .
in recent months , Hungary has become a significant bott@@ len@@ eck and entry point to the European Union for many war refugees from Syria and elsewhere in the Middle East .
however , Prime Minister Viktor Or@@ ban insist@@ ed that most of the forthcoming economic refugees are looking for a better life , and not war refugees who are entitled to protection - a view strongly contrary to other EU countries , including Germany .
the new laws , which came into force at midnight in Hungary , make the crossing of the border or damaging the 4 @-@ meter ( 13 ft ) high fence that the government had built along the southern border with Serbia to a crime . these laws also impose higher prison sentences for convic@@ ted traffi@@ ckers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to the situation created by mass migration , the Hungarian government declares its emergency , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Government spokes@@ man Z@@ ol@@ tan K@@ ov@@ acs Repor@@ ters in the southern city of Sz@@ eg@@ ed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we say it very clearly : illegal border crossing is a crime .
the Parliament must still agree on the use of the military , expected for next week , but repor@@ ters from Associated Press have already seen on the border heavily armed soldiers with vehicles and dogs already for days .
Gy@@ or@@ gy Bak@@ ony , country security advis@@ er for Or@@ ban , said that authorities have caught 45 people trying to cross the border , 15 others had already penet@@ rated deeper into the country .
they come across by damaging the fence , they are now in police custody and are accused of comm@@ itting crimes according to the new laws .
authorities are trying to repair the fence .
Hungarian officials closed on Tuesday morning two of the seven border cross@@ ings with Serbia following a train wagon with bar@@ bed wire to close the borders .
chaos surrounded the most important border crossing near Ros@@ z@@ ke , Hungary , when Hungary opened a small office in a metal container to process the data of people and squee@@ ze a crowd to push for it .
about 20 managed to enter , but thousands remained outside .
another group of migrants blocked the main highway connection between Serbia and Hungary and said they would refuse food and water until they are allowed to enter Hungary .
election @-@ 2016 : H@@ illary Clinton &apos;s head ahead of Ber@@ nie S@@ anders in national survey
the former US Secretary of State H@@ illary Clinton continues to hold a double @-@ digit advance in the democratic race for nom@@ ination at the national level , but Sen@@ ator Ber@@ nie S@@ anders wins her face against ground .
Clinton now has the support of 47 percent of the democratic voters in the prim@@ aries ( 58 percent earlier ) , while S@@ anders is second , with 27 percent ( 17 percent increase ) .
vice @-@ President Joe Bi@@ den , who has not yet announced whether he is chann@@ elled for the pres@@ idency , receives support from 15 percent of the democratic voters of the prim@@ aries .
more than five months before the beginning of the prim@@ aries , most democratic voters say that it is too early to say that their opinion determines which candidate they will support .
but Clinton &apos;s supporters are more consistent in their election than that of the other candidates .
since the C@@ BS News survey Clinton has lost a number of demographic groups , while S@@ anders scored some gains .
Clinton has a big advantage in women and gem@@ s , but these projections have dimin@@ ished .
their support for men has dropped significantly , and S@@ anders returns only with 5 points .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Clin@@ tons advantage among democratic voters under the age of 50 has evapor@@ ated , and they and S@@ anders are now at the same level . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Clinton still has a big advantage over the older voters .
last month Clinton was in front of S@@ anders with a double @-@ digit advance at the Liber@@ als , but S@@ anders has now a 5 @-@ point lead in this group .
about half of the democratic voters of the prim@@ aries nationwide say they would support Clinton if they were nominated by the party .
a quarter would support it with some reservations and another 15 percent would only support it because it is the candidate .
they would not support six percent .
it may not be surprising that Clinton &apos;s current supporters are especially enthusiastic about it .
the views are more bl@@ ended with those who currently don &apos;t support Clinton - only about one quarter would support them enthusias@@ tically .
while 48 per cent of the democratic voters of the prim@@ aries say that they support Clinton with enthusiasm , less Republi@@ can voters say this over their peak channel data Donald Tr@@ ump ( 35 percent ) .
when Clinton supporters are asked in an open question why they want them to be the candidate , the most common answer is that she has the right experience ( 16 percent ) , followed by the view that it &apos;s time that a woman president is ( 13 percent ) and that she is the best candidate for the job ( 10 percent ) .
Clinton Clinton &apos;s connection with Bill Clinton ( 9 per cent ) is also mentioned by Clinton &apos;s supporters .
consent to dealing with the problems and the di@@ v@@ ability are also cited .
as the vice @-@ president poses a potential for the presidential office in the scales , 57 per cent of the democratic voters of the prim@@ aries would like to see him in the race - although a third believes he should not do it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if democratic voters of the prim@@ aries are asked who would be their second choice for the party , Bi@@ den is at the head . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
von Clin@@ tons &apos;s followers say more than half that Bi@@ den would be their second choice far ahead of S@@ anders .
if Bi@@ den decides not to fight for the nom@@ ination of the democr@@ ats , H@@ illary Clinton &apos;s lead is raised in front of S@@ anders , from 20 points with Bi@@ den in race to 30 points without him in the race .
fifty @-@ five percent of the democratic voters see Clinton as a candidate with the best chances of winning the election ; however , this figure has fallen from 78 percent last month .
Bi@@ den is by far a second in this measurement , but the percentage that sees him as the &quot; cho@@ ic@@ est &quot; has increased .
yet , on the question of what is more important in a candidate , Democ@@ rat voters call questions about the elec@@ torate .
similar to last month , no single democratic candidate or potential candidate stands out for these elec@@ tors of the prim@@ aries as unacceptable .
the Democratic candidates or potential candidates are providing good results with some important tra@@ its among voters in the prim@@ acy of their party .
maj@@ orities consider Clinton , S@@ anders and Bi@@ den as honest and trust@@ worthy and equipped with strong leadership qualities .
with the three candidates , Bi@@ den is best in terms of hon@@ esty , while Clin@@ tons &apos;s strength is the leadership .
thirty percent of democratic voters do not believe Clinton is honest and trust@@ worthy , twice as many say this about S@@ anders ( 15 percent ) , but 27 percent have no opinion of him .
democratic voters of the prim@@ aries generally see Clinton , S@@ anders and Bi@@ den ide@@ ologically in accordance with their views .
in all these measurements , about a quarter of the democratic voters have no opinion of S@@ anders .
as questions about H@@ illary Clinton &apos;s use of a personal email address and a server during the term of office as Foreign Minister continue to be questioned , most Democratic voters of the prim@@ aries are satisfied with their explanation of the matter and say that it has not influenced their opinions overall .
but it is another story in the American public altogether .
half of Americans are now dis@@ satisfied with their explanation , while only about a third is satisfied .
public opinion was split in March , shortly after the problem came to light .
most Americans said that the email controversy had no impact on Clinton &apos;s general opinion , although 36 percent said that their opinion of it was still wor@@ sen@@ ing .
there are mainly Republi@@ cans , more than six out of 10 who say their views of Clinton have become worse .
although Clinton is regarded by the voters of their party as honest and trust@@ worthy , this continues to be a problem for them under registered voters overall : only 32 per cent see them as honest and trust@@ worthy , eight percent less than last month and 15 points less since May .
62 percent of voters do not hold them for an honest and trust@@ worthy person .
at the same time , 55 percent of voters are not honest and not trust@@ worthy all over the country .
however , Clinton and Tr@@ ump have good grades in leadership .
of the six candidates , Bi@@ den , Car@@ son and Bush rank the best in hon@@ esty .
a majority sees S@@ differently sooner than hon@@ estly , but as with Car@@ son many have no opinion of him .
the error rate for the sample of 3@@ 51 Democratic voters in the prim@@ aries is 6 percentage points .
Ben Car@@ son moves closer to Donald Tr@@ ump in nationwide survey
Ben Car@@ son is in the latest survey of C@@ BS News / New York Times densely behind Donald Tr@@ ump
the two candidates now account for half of the support of the voters in the new survey , and others will lose their grip dramatically .
Republi@@ can voters continue to support Tr@@ ump in large numbers nationwide . support is growing from 23 % in the last C@@ BS survey conducted ahead of Fox News Deb@@ ate last month , by 27 % in the survey on Tuesday .
but Car@@ son shot from 6 % to 23 % in the same period .
the survey also revealed that Car@@ son arrives well with demographic groups and sur@@ passes Tr@@ ump under Republi@@ can voters with higher education .
the rest of the field , with the exception of Car@@ ly Fi@@ or@@ ina and Ohio Gover@@ nor John Ka@@ sich , is beaten with Wis@@ cons@@ ins Gover@@ nor Scott Walker , who is most pleased , and from 10 % support last month to now 2 % .
former Gover@@ nor J@@ eb Bush , former Gover@@ nor of Ar@@ kan@@ s@@ as Mike Hu@@ ck@@ ab@@ ee and Florida Sen@@ ator Marco Ru@@ bio , are in third place at 6 % .
the error margin in the sample of 3@@ 76 Republi@@ can voters in this latest survey is plus or minus 6 % and was conducted in September .
the latest CN@@ N / OR@@ C survey , which was published last week , shows that Car@@ son climb@@ s in surveys - with 19 % support from the Republi@@ cans , behind the Tr@@ ump with 32 % support .
the latest news from ABC News / Washington Post also showed Tr@@ ump in front of Car@@ son .
with a look at a Car@@ son rising in the last week , Tr@@ ump found some si@@ eves for the former neuro@@ surgeon , even after Car@@ son ap@@ ologi@@ zed to question Tr@@ um@@ ps &apos;s faith .
&quot; we need energy , &quot; said Tr@@ ump last Saturday during a campaign show in I@@ owa .
pleasant bathing temperatures : the eastern Mediterranean is currently up to 29 degrees warm .
even if peak values are measured only in the distance , a trip to the Mediterranean is enough for bathing vac@@ ation@@ ers to find even hot water .
a bath in the north or the Baltic should be a rather short pleasure with a maximum of 17 degrees .
some people don &apos;t go to the sea anymore : maximum 18 degrees has the water in the North and Baltic Sea this week , the German Weather Service ( DW@@ D ) shares with .
on the other hand , bathing temperatures still offer the Mediterranean : in the east it is even up to 29 degrees .
in the Adriatic it is at the top 25 degrees , in France 23 degrees .
the Red Sea in Egypt comes to 28 degrees .
five members of the Brotherhood charged with the death of Bar@@ uch College rel@@ o@@ ads
almost two years after a student died during a bul@@ ky ritual of a student connection in Po@@ con@@ o Mountains , Pennsylvania , murder accus@@ ations were filed against five persons .
members of the New York Bar@@ uch College P@@ i @-@ Delta @-@ P@@ si f@@ rat@@ ernity attacked Ch@@ un &quot; Michael &quot; Den@@ g during an introduc@@ tory ritual in September 2013 brut@@ ally and delayed his transport to the hospital , which contributed to his death , shared the police with .
officials said that he had been loaded with blin@@ d@@ folded eyes with a 30 @-@ pound back@@ pack full of sand , and attacked repeatedly while he tried to go over a frozen field to a goal .
Mr. Den@@ g finally compl@@ ained about head@@ aches , then he fell un@@ conscious .
the members of the P@@ i @-@ Delta @-@ P@@ si @-@ Brotherhood did not call the emergency number 911 after Den@@ g was power@@ less and waited for an hour before they brought him to a hospital , so the police .
however , they had the time to change D@@ eng@@ s &apos;s clothing , goo@@ gle his symptoms and contact Andy Men@@ g , the national president of the Brotherhood , to seek advice , said Poli@@ ti@@ ff Chris Wagner at a press conference .
&quot; at this point the members began to hide utensils and set the well @-@ being of the Brotherhood in principle by Michael Den@@ g , &quot; said Poli@@ gra@@ ef Wagner .
he could not be resur@@ rec@@ ted , and the next morning he died of his injuries .
after an aut@@ op@@ sy report , Den@@ g was repeatedly added to the head , body and thi@@ ghs with bl@@ unt force .
&quot; too many families have been destroyed by the Brotherhood of the Brotherhood . at least one student dies at the har@@ ass@@ roots every year since 1970 , &quot; said Douglas Fi@@ er@@ berg , a lawyer who represents D@@ eng@@ i &apos;s family , in an explanation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; bro@@ ther@@ hoods and their members must be held accoun@@ table , and this step by authorities is very important . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a County Grand Jury of Mon@@ ro@@ e recommended an indictment for murder of the third grade for the first five members .
thirty @-@ two members of the Brotherhood , including Mr Men@@ g , are also accused of har@@ ass@@ ment and formation of a criminal association .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we do not only want to be responsible for the persons involved , but if there is an organisation which - officially or un@@ officially - has sanc@@ tioned this , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wagner at a press conference on Tuesday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Bar@@ uch College has banned the Brotherhood , and the national bro@@ therhood has rev@@ oked its affili@@ ation to the local community .
this will happen if the F@@ ed increases interest rates

we know that .
what we don &apos;t know is how long it will take and how long it will last .
in particular , the history of the economy offers only little guidance for the process .
a recession came after only 11 months after the first interest rate increase and lasted 86 months .
the aggres@@ si@@ veness of the Federal Reserve in raising interest rates is often , al@@ beit not always , a factor in how the economy and the financial investments react .
therefore , representatives of the US Central Bank have strongly emphasized that investors should not concentrate when it begins to increase interest rates , but rather on the period required for normal@@ isation .
in fact , several variables play a role .
however , in the end market participants could find that all the excitement might be exagger@@ ated because of an increase in interest rates .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the first increase in the F@@ ed since the global financial crisis will inevitably be interpreted as a signal for the end of the era of &quot; cheap money &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Julian Jes@@ so@@ p , Chief Econom@@ ist at Capital Economics , in a communication to customers .
in contrast , we do not expect the gradual return of US interest to normal heights , but still at a low level to lead to sei@@ s@@ mic shock that many seem to fear .
this does not mean that there will be no effects .
here is a look based on historical trends and how some areas of the economy could react :
as the market has seen last month , the anticip@@ ation of interest increases can make things volati@@ le for a while .
as soon as the increase occurs , the influence is not so dramatic .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there seems to be a tendency for net income from 12 to 24 months after the first increase , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; which might again reflect the delay in monetary policy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said German bank analysts in a recent study on what happens after the interest rate of the F@@ ed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
more specifically , the market has been in upward trend in the past 35 years - about 14 percent - on the way to increase interest rates , rather flat in the 250 days thereafter ( average gain of 2.6 percent ) , then back to normal state after 500 days , with an average return in previous six previous cycles of 14.@@ 4 percent , according to a current analysis , the Bob D@@ oll , chief facility strateg@@ ist at Nu@@ ve@@ en Asset Management , at Bar@@ ron &apos;s .
Deutsche Bank said that the impact on the shares tends to occur later in the increases cycle and the return on investment begins to decrease .
rec@@ essions are a fact of economic life , but interest increases often promote it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the current case , the F@@ ed is faced with a number of conditions that could not exist before and accelerate the recession . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is extremely not@@ e@@ worthy that the gross domestic product will be near its lowest point in case of a higher interest rate of the F@@ ed .
according to Deutsche Bank , the 118 interest rate increases since 1950 only twice the nominal GDP under 4.5 percent .
although the second quarter of 2015 was 3.6 percent , few expect this to continue and expect only 1.5 percent for the third quarter , according to Atlanta F@@ ed .
interest increases in such fragile economic setting could be ris@@ ky and raise the question , &quot; if it is different this time , &quot; said Deutsche Bank .
market participants have set themselves on an interest rise of the F@@ ed all year , and all eyes were addressed to the session of the Federal Open Market Committee this week , which ends on Thursday .
while many strate@@ gi@@ sts and econom@@ ists believe that FO@@ MC could appro@@ ve an increase in this session , fut@@ ures trading is only a 25 percent chance .
&quot; in our study all under@@ mining cycles from 1950 to today have taken place in a super cycle with increasing momentum in GDP and pre @-@ rec@@ es@@ sion@@ ary heights very quickly put into the shadow after the start of recovery , &quot; says the report .
in contrast , this is a clearly slow recovery from what was the worst recession in the observed phase .
the current cycle is by far the longest that the F@@ ed has been waiting since the end of the last recession ; the record was 35 months , and this has been 74 months so far .
the fixed income was also volati@@ le , as the market anticip@@ ates an increase in interest rates , and the pattern is quite similar to the capital market .
the main difference is that bonds are faster than stocks when they change their strategic course .
bonds seem to change direction once the first increase / decrease occurs in the cycle .
at the end of the raising cycle , the bond @-@ du@@ cks immediately fall , said the Deutsche Bank .
the strate@@ gi@@ sts of Charles Sch@@ wa@@ b believe that the rise in interest rates will result in yields coming closer together between longer and shorter bonds and leading to a fl@@ atten@@ ing of the curve .
high @-@ interest bonds often yield better yields in such a climate , although &quot; we are still cau@@ tious to expect higher yields , &quot; said Kath@@ y Jones , fixed @-@ income analy@@ st at Sch@@ wa@@ b , in an analysis .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is interesting , says Jones , that the markets have already adapted to F@@ ed strategy expectations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition to the strength of the dollar and the decline in inflation expectations , there are some indications that the market has adapted to the prospect of stric@@ ter monetary policy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
short @-@ term interest has risen , the earning curve is fl@@ atter , lending margins have expanded and volati@@ lity has risen - all the features of the market when the F@@ ed has sharpen@@ ed its strategy .
in the large and whole , companies that deal with the larger portion of their business activities in the United States will benefit when interest rates rise and local products become more attractive .
multinational companies with high debts will be worse , as an increase in dollars makes their products more expensive in the global market , as well as the financing of their debts .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; history shows that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; quality &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; shares tend to react extremely positively three months after an initial increase in interest , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gold@@ man Sach@@ s analysts said in a report for the customers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
companies with a strong balance sheet have sur@@ passed an average of 5 percentage points after each of the interest rate increases in 1994 , 1999 and 2004 .
companies with high capital yields and low volati@@ lity in their shares also sur@@ passed their low @-@ quality counter@@ parts by average of 4 ( percentage points ) and 3 ( percentage points ) .
debts will be a big issue .
companies with a high share of flexible interest will lose most , said Gold@@ man .
outside the pure share games consumers will also benefit from the rising dollars .
savers could see gains from higher earnings , even if experts of different opinions are , how quickly this will take place .
BBC Radio 3 is a copy of the Classic FM , says Members of Parliament Andrew B@@ ing@@ ham
the Conserv@@ ative Member of the Parliament critic@@ ised the channel for its &quot; arrest &quot;
he ar@@ gues that he is increasingly not distingu@@ ish@@ able from commercial ri@@ vals .
he also aimed at the BBC Music Awards and said that they only im@@ itated The Br@@ its
Parliament @-@ colleague Dam@@ ien Coll@@ ins attacked The Voice and said that this was not very original .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; BBC Radio 3 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; converts &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Classic FM , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says a leading parliament member and raises new pressure on the transmitter to prove that he does something that the private broad@@ cast@@ ers do not do . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Conserv@@ ative MP Andrew B@@ ing@@ ham also said the BBC bos@@ ses that the public @-@ law radio station &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stupid &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and increasingly no longer be distinguished from its commercial competitors . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; radio 3 seems - I don &apos;t like to use the word &quot; sil@@ ly &quot; - but it seems to turn into Classic FM , &quot; he said .
he also aimed at the BBC Music Awards , which started last December .
the BBC Music Awards , which started last year , appear to be just under a different name .
so if you are trying to do something else - these are two spontaneously named examples where you only im@@ itate what is already on the market , &quot; Mr B@@ ing@@ ham said .
the BBC &apos;s CEO rejected the alleg@@ ations and argued that BBC Radio 3 was far ahead of its commercial competitors when it comes to live music and educ@@ ating the public .
what I learn from Radio 3 , I won &apos;t learn about classical music anywhere else .
and there is a commitment to live music and music that is truly un@@ sur@@ passed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and the commitment of Radio 3 to find new music and to commission new works is really important , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the beginning of this year , BBC Radio 3 Contro@@ ll@@ ers Alan Dav@@ ey argued that he needed to work harder to engage the audience as it did in the past because the British were less informed of classical music .
however , Radio 3 was not the only element of BBC production that came under fire during the hearing in the Committee on the Sel@@ ection of Culture , Media and Sport to tramp@@ le on the commercial ri@@ vals .
the T@@ ory MEP Dam@@ ien Coll@@ ins handle The Voice - the musical talent show of the BBC , which was bought by the Dutch producer T@@ alp@@ a Media for an estimated cost of 22 million £ .
do you see why this program is often discussed because it is not original and not particularly striking ?
Lord Hall insist@@ ed that the BBC 1 show - with Pal@@ oma Faith and Boy George as Ju@@ dge - was produced in a special BBC way .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he added , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he would like the company to find &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a hit from our in @-@ house stall &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; when the next time it star@@ es out an entertainment series . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , he refused to exclude the order from other series of The Voice in the future or to issue money to the fee pay@@ ers for other entertainment formats .
Internet sales in August on the slow@@ est and Black Friday can be responsible for this
in the first three months of 2015 , there were seven percent increase in online sales .
last month there was the lowest result since the beginning of the records in 2000
online sales increased three years ago by using mobile phones for shopping
experts believe that Black Friday in November has slow@@ ed down spending
for over a decade the virtual shopping has dri@@ lled , and many of Britain &apos;s main shopping streets have turned into gh@@ ost cities .
however , experts say that there are signs that online sales stagn@@ ate after new figures show only seven percent in the first three months of 2015 .
the total expenditure for August represented the lowest increase in growth since the beginning of the records in 2000 , with only five percent increase compared to the previous year .
experts say there are signs that online sales stagn@@ ate after new numbers showed only seven percent growth in the first three months of 2015
&quot; if you look at the growth rates for the previous years and go back to 2000 , it has always developed over time , &quot; said Andy Mul@@ c@@ ah@@ y , editor of the IM@@ R sales index of the Guardian .
he explained that sales of online sales increased three years ago when buyers started making purchases with their cell phone purchases .
it meant that more people could shop online and that people could do so in different environments , e.g. at home on the sofa .
but now that is a swing , and we may experience that the growth is dimin@@ ished .
the Black Friday phenomenon imported from America is cited as a reason for the decreasing turnover .
experts believe that buyers will hold their purchases back before this event taking place on the last Friday in November .
last year , five times the average number of buyers went around their computers to make their bar@@ gains , and some dealer websites crashed .
experts believe that Black Friday , on which the buyers batt@@ led for bar@@ gains , could prevent buyers from buying purchases .
a study by the British Retail Con@@ sortium found out that £ 5 £ was spent online at £ 5 .
for some products , such as TV and washing machines , more than one third of purchases are now done via web shops .
at the same time more than a quarter of men bu@@ ys clothing and shoes online rather than in the fashion chains in the inner cities .
Muslims buried in Mec@@ ca during the crane accident - Bin Laden &apos;s family is sanc@@ tioned
the bodies of 29 dead are carried by Muslims in the first bur@@ ial in Mec@@ ca through the streets .
Saudi Arabia partially susp@@ ects the collapse of the huge Saudi bin Laden batch
the Ministry of Health said that a total of 3@@ 94 people were injured after the crane collap@@ sed
hundreds of Muslims gathered when 29 of the victims were carried through the streets to bury the slain who were killed when a crane collap@@ sed to Mec@@ ca &apos;s grandfather .
mour@@ ning filled , largely dressed in white , the track to pay their respect when the first of the dead joined their last trip to the Al @-@ Mo@@ aissance grav@@ eyard .
the procession went past the Holy Place where only days had been a building crane through the ceiling of the mos@@ que and then rus@@ hed onto the bed .
the bodies were released for the funeral , when the Saudi king made a sanc@@ tion over the bin Laden &apos;s construction company because of the disaster that left 3@@ 94 wounded .
the cor@@ p@@ ses of 29 people who were killed when a crane collap@@ sed through the Great Central mos@@ que of Mec@@ ca were carried through the streets .
among the dead , Q@@ asi@@ m Ak@@ ram from Bol@@ ton , Greater Manchester , was the father of four children who was on his first pilgrimage to support the crane .
Mr Ak@@ ram was with his parents before the beginning of the annual H@@ add@@ an in the Great Mos@@ que .
Saudi officials have already agreed that the H@@ add@@ an will continue to Mec@@ ca with thousands who will continue to come to the city .
today King Sal@@ man , the Bin Laden band said , should not have been allowed to steal the arm of the crane when it was not used .
an Arabic version of the decree published by the state Saudi Press Agency said that the Bin Laden batch is responsible for the collapse .
the service of the news agency in English did not report this detail , but said that the management of the company was forbidden abroad .
at the beginning of this week , Sal@@ man ple@@ dged to reveal what caused the fall of the crane , which rus@@ hed into an inner courtyard of the Grand Mo@@ sch@@ ee , where hundreds of thousands of Muslims gathered in front of the H@@ add@@ an , which later took place this month .
the Bin Laden batch has issued no statements about the collapse of the crane , and its representatives were not available for a statement .
the Royal Dec@@ ree also rebu@@ ked the group because of not current security measures and because they did not cooperate with meteor@@ ologists .
dozens of cranes surround Mek@@ ka &apos;s Groß@@ mo@@ sch@@ ee as part of the massive building project headed by the Bin Laden Group .
the Bin Laden family has been associated with the Saudi royal family for decades and takes over bigger construction projects .
the dec@@ eased leader of Al Qaeda , Os@@ ama bin Laden , was an apost@@ ate son that was ex@@ propri@@ ated by the family in the 1990 &quot; s .
the crash of the crane came in the midst of strong winds and rain , only a few days before the arrival of millions in the Kingdom for the pilgrimage , which is required at least once in the life of each healthy Muslims .
officials said 158 people stay in the hospital .
government officials ordered that 1 million Ri@@ al ( £ 17@@ 4.000 ) are to be paid to the members of the killed and the same amount of permanently wounded .
other wounded will get half of this amount .
B &amp; Q Bos@@ s says that the time of cheap Eastern European craftsmen is over
British increasingly employ arti@@ sans , says Ver@@ oni@@ que Lau@@ ry
the number of skilled craftsmen from Eastern Europe has increased
this means that 200 other scre@@ w@@ fix stores target@@ ing professional tra@@ des@@ people will be opened .
at the same time , King@@ fis@@ her will close 60 B &amp; Q outlets throughout the country
by Ru@@ pert St@@ einer , Chief Executive correspon@@ dent of the Daily Mail
it is alleged that Br@@ its put down their h@@ amm@@ ers and brushes in favor of the use of qualified Eastern European handic@@ ra@@ fts@@ men who carry out work in their home
if you can use a hammer or a brush to paint walls , you seem to belong to a minority nowadays .
the British increasingly employ arti@@ sans in order to carry out DIY jobs in their houses , such as the boss of the company behind B &amp; Q .
V@@ é@@ ron@@ ique Lau@@ ry , the new Managing Director of King@@ fis@@ her , who owns the DIY chain , said that a large increase in the number of qualified professionals from Eastern Europe who offer services at low prices is now out@@ dated .
for this reason , King@@ fis@@ her plans to open 200 other Scre@@ w@@ fix shops that focus on arti@@ sans and close 60 sales points from B &amp; Q .
Mr@@ s Lau@@ ry said she wants to employ more women in B &amp; Q shops , because eight out of ten purchase decisions are made by women .
at the moment , men out@@ weigh the men .
she said that it is necessary to meet the growing demographic trends that have more female single households performing more renov@@ ations than in the past .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mr@@ s Lau@@ ry said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it still works a majority of men in our branches . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we have to post@@ p@@ one this more strongly towards a balance .
basically , half of our clients consist of women with 80 percent of decisions on the purchase of articles by women .
women play a major role in the decision @-@ making process .
Mr@@ s Lau@@ ry , who is one of only five women listed at the top of a British in the FT@@ SE@@ 100 index , has also structured her top team to reflect an equal number of men and women in leadership positions .
King@@ Fis@@ her is almost the only company that occupies exactly 50 percent of the team with women , including its management and Chief Financial Officer .
Mr@@ s Lau@@ ry said : &quot; this was a conscious decision - diversity is an important issue here .
it was not difficult to find good women for our Supervisory Board .
King@@ Fis@@ her reported a decline in the half @-@ year profit and sales after the Group deb@@ ated the costs of closing the stores .
because of the trends , King@@ fis@@ her , who owns Scre@@ w@@ fix and B &amp; Q , will open 200 new branches .
officials of A@@ ich / D@@ ob due to in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity in court
on Wednesday , two function@@ aries of the Austrian volleyball champion A@@ ich / D@@ ob have to be responsible for in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity and transfer of taxes on Wednesday .
the def@@ end@@ ants were not guilty .
one of them had also been accused of abuse of office .
he has been acqu@@ itted of this accus@@ ation in May .
the current process was postpon@@ ed .
according to the At@@ tor@@ ney General , Robert Ri@@ ffel had cryst@@ alli@@ sed in the preliminary investigation that the def@@ end@@ ants used money from club accounts in the years 2006 to 2011 , about which they were allowed to disp@@ ose in their functions , for private purposes .
he estimated the damage with around 400@@ ,000 euros .
the sports officials are also indic@@ ted for financial years .
this fact left the chair of the Sho@@ v@@ eller Senate , judge Micha@@ ela San@@ in .
it shall be negotiated at a later date .
in order to blame the in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity , the Defence argued that at no time an asset had ar@@ isen .
the sports officials only accounted for expense allowance and the sports club , for which they had been operating from 1982 to 2011 and in which they invested a lot of time and money , was deduc@@ ted from the debt . in 2001 , the Pas@@ si@@ va amounted to approximately 600@@ ,000 Sch@@ ill@@ ings ( approx . 4@@ 4.000 Euro ) .
&quot; back then we stood in front of the situation : do we continue the club or do we stop ? , &quot; said one of the def@@ end@@ ants , in the bread profession of the audi@@ tor of the Finance Office .
with his colleague and co @-@ accused , he then decided to take over this task .
with all risks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have advanced money , put our life insur@@ ances to the bank as security , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said during the arrest . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the association it has been agreed : you can freely admini@@ ster the money , there are only no debts to be made . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition , with corresponding financial success , the payment of the expense allowance had been decided back until 1991 .
therefore one part of the expense allowance was paid for years later , namely from 2003 , when a plus had been on the account .
therefore , l@@ ump sum and not detailed bookings appeared , the former watch@@ man explained the operations .
the accounts and savings books managed to manage the two def@@ end@@ ants together , &quot; said the second accused .
why the pay@@ outs were not disclosed in detail to the association , the judge asked .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the association did not care in detail for the financial reinforcement , it was important to have only the freedom of debt , so the answer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
when in 2011 , an amount of 120@@ ,000 euros was transferred to the club account against the one functional investigation for official abuse .
these were set@@ backs , declared the def@@ end@@ ants .
this securities account ran on the name of the second accused and was not known according to the association &apos;s statement .
&quot; why ? &quot; the judge wanted to know .
the respon@@ dent did not know for a long time .
then he finally thought he had believed that this was the best thing for the club .
if something had happened to him , no one would have known anything about this money , the prosec@@ utor asked him .
the accused was informed , justified the function@@ ary .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this transfer was formulated as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; claim recovery &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
why compensation ? , judge and prosec@@ utor wanted to know .
the first def@@ end@@ ant declared that he did not agree with this formulation , because the association never suffered any damage .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but what should I do if the lawyer says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with this you are all of the tailor . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; am I a legal representative ? &quot; he asked .
furthermore , the function@@ ary said he has never paid a cent salary , he just pay@@ ed the kilomet@@ re money and di@@ ets .
at di@@ ets he charged the association 1,000 euros a month , but the actual expenditure was much higher , he added .
the def@@ end@@ ants were not able to prove precise documents for the early years .
these were no longer kept , after an audit , in which everything had been deemed to be correctly judged .
the second def@@ end@@ ant also took o@@ dom@@ eter money .
in his statement , he stated in his statement that he had to travel to the bank from his home town of the international market to Blei@@ burg .
the main hearing is continued on September 23 with the inter@@ ro@@ gation of witnesses .
Hewlett @-@ Packard presents another 30,000 jobs
in addition to the staff cuts that have been running for three years , the Compu@@ terri@@ ese will cut further jobs from the company &apos;s spl@@ itting up .
the positions of the Hewlett @-@ Packard ( HP ) computer have no end .
as part of its restructuring , the US technology group plans to reduce the mining of 25,000 to 30,000 jobs in its corporate customer segment .
as a result , costs in the amount of EUR 2.7 billion ( 2.4 billion euros ) will be saved , the company announced on Tuesday .
the step will lead to a special load of around 2.7 billion dollars , which will fall from the fourth quarter .
the disman@@ tling of 55@@ ,000 jobs , which has been running for three years , has not yet been completed .
at the end of the fiscal year 2013 / 14 , HP employed some 30@@ 2,000 associates .
the Hewlett @-@ Packard @-@ share gave a 2.3 percent share in the after@@ market .
the large @-@ scale corporation from Pal@@ o Alto , California , is currently spl@@ itting up : the computer and printer business is to be bund@@ led in a new society , separated from the more promising areas with computer servers and data storage for companies as well as other services .
both business units are to be listed on the stock exchange .
a again dis@@ ap@@ pointing PC sales and a weaker demand from corporate customers after its services set the world &apos;s second @-@ largest PC manufacturer to Lenovo last .
in the third quarter of the financial year at the end of July , sales of PC and printers declined by 11.@@ 5 percent .
sales fell by 8 percent to just under 25.@@ 4 billion dollars .
the proceeds went back to 15 out of 16 quarters .
HP respon@@ ds to changes in the industry with a spl@@ itting and massive setting .
the 76 @-@ year @-@ old company under the leadership of Me@@ g Whit@@ man recently re@@ acted to the fact that customers increasingly buy smartphones and tablets instead of conventional computers and do more business online .
in total , Whit@@ man &apos;s restructuring plans envis@@ age the reduction of some 55@@ ,000 jobs .
conflict : majority supports the Anti @-@ IS Training mission
however , a direct involvement of German soldiers in hos@@ tilities in Iraq would predominantly lead to rejection : 54 per cent said , 35 percent were cons@@ enting .

24 percent are against the contrary to intervene in the conflict .
a collaboration with the Syrian leader Bas@@ har al @-@ Assad declined 51 per cent of the respon@@ dents , 20 per cent would be .
29 percent could not decide .

R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke : violent breach of Serbian @-@ Hungarian border
the Hungarian police have deployed on the Serbian border with R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke Tr@@ än@@ eng@@ as and Wasser@@ werfer against several hundred abandoned refugees .
Eur@@ on@@ ews correspon@@ dent D@@ á@@ ni@@ el Bo@@ z@@ si@@ k has witnessed the erup@@ tion of violence at the border control point .
he reported by phone :
a group of refugees broke the border .
behind it was a police line formed and behind the polic@@ emen there was a water lamp ready .
40 to 50 refugees started throwing stones , sticks and plastic bottles to the officials .
the officials initially set up pepper spray .
after that the police used tear gas .
a lot of tear gas was spra@@ yed towards the refugees .
the group was thus dissolved .
the refugees have now withdrawn a bit .
a pregnant and apparently injured woman was removed from the zone .
children who inhal@@ ed the tear gas cried out .
other refugees sank into themselves and suffered from short@@ ness of breath .
the spokes@@ men of the Serbian police also suffered injuries by using tear gas and pepper spray .
time of decision on interest rates for the US central bank
the world ob@@ serves when the US central bank arrives at two days , on Wednesday and Thursday , to make the important decision whether for the first time since almost a decade the interest is raised or not .
a survey among 80 econom@@ ists questioned by Reu@@ ters found out that a little more than half the last week of view was that the F@@ ed would do this , now think that the F@@ ed will remain a little longer and the interest rates at the current level of 0 @-@ 0.@@ 25 percent will be held .
it is a historical event because it has been seven years since F@@ ed has set interest on NU@@ LL .
&quot; for the first time , we approach a situation in which a large central bank may leave the zero area and start a process of normal@@ ising interest rates , &quot; said Angel U@@ bid , senior staff at Peter@@ son Institute for International Economics .
the U.S. economy is on a relatively good level of power , tri@@ l@@ lion dollars are added to the balance sheet and generate only a low inflation .
however , the F@@ ed cannot ignore the less ros@@ y outlook on global relationships .
she warned the markets to adapt to an increase , but the signs point out that the odds against such a step are good .
the decision is to be announced at 8 p.m. CE@@ T on Thursday
death Prot@@ ector at Delta State University left ap@@ ologies
after shooting and killing his girlfriend in Miss@@ issi@@ ppi on Monday morning - and before he later shot his colleague and killed - Sh@@ ann@@ on Lamb wrote a note to say that he was &quot; sorry &quot; in the first murder and wanted &quot; he could not make it happen , &quot; authorities announced on Tuesday .
the police in Gau@@ tier , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , said that Lamb , professor of ge@@ ography and social science education at Delta State University , called the emergency number at 10 : 00 on Monday morning
and said he shot on someone and killed someone .
lamb told the employee of the emergency call that the police had to send police officers to his home .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I shot my wife yesterday evening , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and he also mentioned that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; cute dog &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is in the house , but &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nobody will distur@@ b , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but probably will be excited . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the police asked the c@@ aller about his name , but he did not give him .
lamb gave no explanation for his shots .
when police entered the scene , they found the body of A@@ my Pr@@ enti@@ ss , 41 , and a hand@@ written notice from Lamb , 45 who said : &quot; I am sorry I wanted , I could und@@ o it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I loved A@@ my , and she is the only woman ever loved me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after writing the note , Lamb had 300 miles to Delta State University where he killed E@@ than Schmidt , a professor of history , before he finally killed his own life on Monday evening when polic@@ emen surrounded him .
President William La@@ For@@ ge said he didn &apos;t know anything about a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt , but &quot; of course there was something in Mr Lam@@ bs &apos;s performance . &quot;
despite reports on Monday that Lamb believed that Pr@@ é@@ ss had also had a relationship with Schmidt , authorities said on Tuesday that there is &quot; no information , no evidence &quot; for a &quot; triangle relationship . &quot;
Pr@@ enti@@ ss was written by Sha@@ wn O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en , who said that they were married for about seven years , as a &quot; good man . &quot;
the two were divor@@ ced 15 years ago , but stayed friends .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said he and Pr@@ é@@ ss would have a daughter who is 19 , and she was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; destroyed &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the ground . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said that Pr@@ enti@@ ss was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; absolutely best friends &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Pr@@ enti@@ ss worked online from home , according to L@@ ins@@ day Know@@ les , who was identified by Sun Her@@ ald as a close friend of Pr@@ enti@@ ss .
Know@@ les said that Pr@@ é@@ ss , who owned a dog called Light@@ ning , met with Lamb for about three years .
&quot; she always wanted to help other people , &quot; Know@@ les said
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the police said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Lamb called for relatives at a certain time on Monday to tell them , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he does not go to prison . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
when polic@@ emen brought him on Highway 1 near Green@@ ville later this night , Lamb drove his car to the side , ran on foot , ran into the forest and killed himself with a shot .
in the spring of 2015 , Lamb received a doc@@ torate from the Delta State University as well as his curriculum at the University &apos;s website .

Eu@@ row@@ ings : Lufthansa builds the Group around
Lufthansa is planning a major corporate restructuring .
the Lufthansa Group wants to save half a billion euros a year alone with a better organisation .
150 of the 1000 executives around the world will cost the conversion of the Group to the workplace .
with the pilot union , however , there are new negotiations .
Lufthansa is expanding its corporate structure and upgrades the cheap Eu@@ row@@ ings .
the target of the real@@ ignment is a contribution to earnings of around € 500 million per year resulting from cost savings and revenue syner@@ gies , and divided the airline on Wednesday .
among other things , Lufthansa will be no longer a management board for the passenger business in the future .
the low @-@ cost eu@@ row@@ ings line should be developed as independent as possible .
in future Karl Ulrich Gar@@ n@@ adt will be responsible for Eu@@ row@@ ings in the management team headed by Chef Car@@ sten Sp@@ oh@@ r .
with the new opening , Sp@@ oh@@ r under@@ lines the importance of Eu@@ row@@ ings , with which the Group wants to compete against Ry@@ an@@ air and Easy@@ jet in the future .
until now , the organization of the 120 000 employees has been complex .
the airlines operated under the umbrella of the Passage Air@@ line Group , which represents three quarters of the annual turnover of 30 billion euros .
new negotiations with the pilots
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the tari@@ ff conflict with the pilot association Cockpit ( VC ) , negotiations will be resum@@ ed on this Thursday after the strike on this Thursday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this shared the union with them .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the topic of talks should be the retirement provision for pilots . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a year with a predicted record result , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Cockpit wanted to arrive at sustainable results as quickly as possible . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the conflict between union and airline led to various strikes in recent months .
in addition to the transitional provision of the pilots the background is &quot; Wings . &quot;
it is fores@@ eeable that the Lufthansa in the fight against competitors routes routes to the Group &apos;s own cheap line Eu@@ row@@ ings .

Luke Sha@@ w from Manchester United cannot play for months due to double frac@@ ture
in the Champions League defeat in Manchester , Luke Sha@@ w won a double frac@@ ture of his right leg at PS@@ V Ein@@ d@@ hoven .
while this brought the left outside def@@ enders to cry and shut him out for at least six months from playing , Louis van Ga@@ al does not give hope that Sha@@ w can play again in this season .
the injury was caused by a ru@@ th@@ less attack by H@@ é@@ c@@ tor Mor@@ eno in the 15th minute after the 20 year old Sha@@ w collap@@ sed into the PS@@ V area .
he was treated for nine minutes on the playground and needed oxygen before he was taken to hospital .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; van Ga@@ al said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he has a double leg score and is in the hospital . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he will be reloc@@ ated tomorrow or maybe a day later and then operated in Manchester .
it &apos;s horri@@ ble - a boy who comes with 18 to Manchester United , it has very hard and then plays fantastic , and then that happens .
in the locker room he had an oxygen mask .
he cried .
I am not a doctor , but if you have a double frac@@ ture , then it takes six months and it will not play in the group phase .
I hope he can play this season again .
Mor@@ eno felt happy to have escaped a red card and the im@@ position of an El@@ f@@ eit .
Nic@@ ola Ri@@ zz@@ oli , the refer@@ ee , has not pen@@ alised the Mexican .
van Ga@@ al suspected that the Italian refer@@ ee had er@@ red .
you can judge for yourself if I say that an El@@ f@@ meter and a red card were due .
it was a very serious attack with both legs .
a tweet to Sha@@ w &apos;s account was : &quot; thank you all for your messages . words cannot describe how broken I am , my way to recovery starts now , I come back more strongly . &quot;

with the European Championship in France , the United Kingdom def@@ enders has an additional incentive to recover until the next June .
Phil@@ lip Coc@@ u , the PS@@ V @-@ Trainer , said : &quot; it &apos;s a very bad injury . &quot;
when a player with this kind of injury leaves the place , all are very sad about it .
it is never the intention of our players to viol@@ ate an opponent .
Mor@@ eno suffered a leg break when Mexico played against Van Ga@@ al Holland team at the 2014 World Cup .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is very difficult because it was not his intention to hurt the opponent , and if you then hear it is a very bad injury , that &apos;s not good , &quot; said Coc@@ u .
for me it was not possible to see the moment .
the only thing I could see was the ball moving in a different direction , so it looked like he had touched him , but I couldn &apos;t see the attack on Luke .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in conversation with S@@ BS@@ 6 Mor@@ eno said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I know how it feels , I know how difficult it can be . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I feel very bad about it . I &apos;m so sorry .

surely David Cameron is better acquainted with The Lor@@ ax ?
it is a matter that all parents will soon learn : if your child loves a book , it will not take long before you know it almost in@@ war@@ dly .
unless you are David Cameron .
when he was asked by a provider of child@@ care systems to name his favourite chil@@ dr@@ ens book , the Prime Minister for The Lor@@ ax , who appeared in 1971 , opted for Dr. Se@@ uss &apos;s environmental bill .
it was a difficult choice , writes Cameron in a message on the website of Super@@ Camp@@ s , and continues : &quot; funny , moving , creative and with a powerful message , it &apos;s a book that I like to read my children because it always seems to be a picture or message that we &apos;ve missed so far . &quot;
everything nice and good , except that the following paragraph , in which Cameron is supposed to describe the story of the book , instead re@@ produces a content of the movie version of 2012 , added the new characters and details to extend the rather short original text .
&quot; amid the walled city of Th@@ need @-@ Ville , where all nature has gone and even the air is a commodity , a boy named T@@ ed hopes to win the heart of Au@@ dre@@ y , the girl of his dreams , &quot; reads . a love interest was Dr. Se@@ uss , whose real name was The@@ odor Se@@ uss Gei@@ sel and who died in 1991 , however completely unknown .
as if this would not be suspi@@ cious enough : the text presented by Cameron is partially read like the summary of the Lor@@ ax movie , which is presented on the website of the Internet Movie Database and so begins : &quot; in the walled city of Th@@ an @-@ Ville , where everything is artificial and even the air is a commodity , a boy named T@@ ed , the heart of Au@@ dre@@ y , hopes to win the girl of his dreams . &quot;
although he ad@@ mits to be a pra@@ g@@ matic father , it seems unlikely that Cameron is so little familiar with the story of the book . here , an un@@ named boy , like the local environment , hears thri@@ ving , thri@@ ving , thri@@ ving On@@ ce @-@ ler , &quot; that speaks in the name of the trees , &quot; devast@@ ates the local environment .
most likely such a relatively low PR task was deleg@@ ated to a hel@@ per who did not read The Lor@@ ax 20 times consec@@ u@@ tively to a child .
a Dow@@ ning @-@ Street spokes@@ woman said that the text probably had come from Cameron &apos;s election bul@@ letin .
Super@@ Camp@@ s confirmed that the text was delivered by Cameron &apos;s staff , but did not give any immediate comments .
Adam Ly@@ th was clearly threatened by the expul@@ sion from England &apos;s team , but it is still difficult
to hit Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates is a difficult task , but when you see the Ka@@ der chosen for the tour England , a repeat of the 3 @-@ 0 test series defeat is not on my card .
I would not exclude a down@@ side .
A@@ last@@ air C@@ ooks page may be less experienced than those three years ago , but there are good spin players in the bat@@ ting list , and the community spirit is strong ; they will not wear sc@@ ars of 2012 , only a you@@ thful positive attitude .
with the ball , Mo@@ een Ali is developing as a spin @-@ Bow@@ ler and Adi@@ l Ras@@ hid , even if he represents an unknown size at the test level , is an option for the attack .
related news : Adam Ly@@ th is leaving the England test cad@@ re and is replaced by Alex H@@ ales .
the decision to let Adam Ly@@ th out of course is hard to analyze for me as his head coach in Yor@@ k@@ shire .
in his seven tests , there were two good attacks under difficult conditions , and the simple but hard reality is that cri@@ cket players are focused on results .
there were no question marks with Joe R@@ oot , for example , and that led to the nom@@ ination , since - and I said this before - players are their own best selection .
long ago , it would have extended the course of Ly@@ th , but he had control of his own destiny .
hopefully , when he strikes out more purchases for Yor@@ k@@ shire , another chance comes .
the England @-@ Trainer Tre@@ vor Bay@@ li@@ ss commen@@ ded his attitude , even if he did not perform so good performances , and that doesn &apos;t surprise me ; he is above all a team @-@ man .
the question of how much time a test drummer receives to put his character is difficult .
Ly@@ th got seven chances - like Sam Rob@@ son before him - while Nick Comp@@ ton got nine .
only Comp@@ ton did get the chance to play home and forward .
the only accus@@ ation that one can raise was that England initially set Jonathan Trot@@ t in the Caribbean when Ly@@ th was in top form - but this lost chance is now in the past .
Alex H@@ ales is coming in and he is a hit man I highly in@@ timi@@ date .
he is an X @-@ factor cri@@ cket player , which we saw in Yor@@ k@@ shire early this season when he scored 2@@ 36 against us on a Tr@@ ent Bridge place , which really hit us .
he must have at least the same opportunities as those before him , but this naturally depends on the team position in the United Arab Emirates .
the idea to leave Mo@@ een next to Cook , which would provide an extra spin Bow@@ ler and get four Qui@@ cks , appeared , and I have nothing against it .
I don &apos;t see why a drummer can &apos;t beat there , and this left @-@ h@@ ander has already shown that he is a vi@@ cious circle of cri@@ cket players .
mos@@ ques may not have done his job for his County Wor@@ c@@ ester@@ shire , but he &apos;s a number 3 for them , and there is no big difference .
my former team @-@ mate Jus@@ tin Lan@@ ger played his first 38 tests at the first drop before he appeared as an op@@ ener in 2001 .
he immediately made three hundred R@@ uns and did not look back .
Z@@ afar Ans@@ ari comes in the ca@@ der as a back @-@ up sp@@ inner , and in my limited use with him he has impressed me as a young man .
people may see his statistics - average 31 with the bat and 35 with the ball - and think it &apos;s a pun@@ t , but there is no large number of backup spi@@ ders that raise their hands and the trainers have opted for youth .
he will learn a lot on this tour .
apart from the team , England has made some smart additions to the train@@ ee .
the appointment of Mah@@ ela J@@ ay@@ awar@@ dene , the B@@ ats@@ man from Sri Lanka , as a consultant for the test games could be a master coup .
he is one of the nic@@ est guys in the game , who will bring a wealth of experience , since he has played in all conditions and against all attacks .
Paul Coll@@ ing@@ wood comes for the white ball stage of the tour and brings energy and a powerful commitment to the setup .
I always felt he was created for the international cri@@ cket competition , as a player or coach , and like Mah@@ ela , he has insights from which we can benefit .
sometimes new voices in the changing cabin can bring fresh wind , even if the messages are in line with what has been said before .
Coll@@ ys team @-@ mate at Dur@@ ham , Ben St@@ okes , is not employed at the One Day@@ ers , R@@ oot got a similar break against Australia and I have no problem with it for my part .
some will not agree , but coaches and team players do not determine the schedule .
and you must remember that as with the players , their jobs depend on the results .
such decisions are not made easy in heart .
the Bre@@ x@@ it stock ( Bre@@ x@@ it = exit of Great Britain from the EU ) could gain access to Zul@@ u if the economy reaches a sl@@ ur@@ ry until 2017
David Cameron &apos;s un@@ wi@@ dened ren@@ eg@@ oti@@ ation strategy to keep Britain in the EU is getting deeper every day even without the choice of brilliant Jerem@@ y &quot; Is it Yes or No ? &quot; Cor@@ by@@ n to the leader of Labour or the TU@@ C , which was fierce on Tuesday because of Europe .
foreigners also have their Cor@@ by@@ ns and Ni@@ gel Far@@ ages .
a European diplom@@ at friend said recently that some member states , so deeply ent@@ angled in various crises , as the EU is now and not always based on their own debt , Britain &apos;s self created agenda with split conc@@ essions and disrup@@ tive treaty changes that they usually do not want , are full .
in Bri@@ gh@@ ton , the TU@@ C decided at its annual meeting that it does not like it if it je@@ op@@ ardi@@ zes social protection .
we could also call it Dave and Georges Sel@@ f@@ ie &apos;s agenda .
Prime Minister and Finance Ministers climb to summit or bilateral meetings in foreign capitals , take a photo of themselves in front of a famous local monument , with or without local sizes , come home and say that they win allies for reforms .
it &apos;s always about me .
my European friend , wishing to look outside Britain inside the EU tent - &quot; Let &apos;s not alone with France , &quot; says Berlin - and lets you see that more and more short @-@ si@@ ghted ministers and officials have come to the point where it doesn &apos;t matter whether we stay or go .
Germany &apos;s cau@@ tious chan@@ cell@@ or Angela Merkel is an ally , but she has been in power for 10 years and wants to leave the office before it looks bad for her as it happened in the exc@@ essively long endurance such as T@@ hat@@ cher ( 11 years ) , Mit@@ ter@@ rand ( 14 ) and K@@ ohl ( 16 ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; French François Hollande can look back on his re @-@ election or his replacement in 2017 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he is also a f@@ ading force .
Poland may soon have a nation@@ alist right government , Spain a left one .
it is hard to imagine that they will get a lim@@ b to help the Sel@@ f@@ ie British whose energy should be better used to prevent Scotland from leaving the UK - something they don &apos;t want because most of the similar separ@@ ati@@ st tendencies have .
therefore some such ministers may even intentionally not plan helpful comments , entirely in SN@@ P style , while Britain &apos;s referendum campaign in 2017 to speed up the Bre@@ x@@ it process , susp@@ ects my friend .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the ren@@ eg@@ oti@@ ation was a bank@@ rupt@@ cy &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; Great Britain has won nothing of value from the ren@@ eg@@ oti@@ ation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Europeans know how pre@@ dat@@ ory the Fle@@ et Street can be at their expense and which EU scep@@ tics are the pres@@ seb@@ ar@@ ones oli@@ gar@@ chy , as they did not , during the 1975 referendum inspired by Tony Ben@@ n , did not support our entry in 1973 with a ratio of 2 : 1 .
you can remember Boris Johnson , the Er@@ z @-@ Euro opport@@ uni@@ sts who made a name as a &quot; EU @-@ straight ban@@ anas &quot; Brussels correspon@@ dent in the early 90 &quot; s .
with all his ma@@ dness , Ed Mili@@ band knew who his enemies were .
this included the med@@ ley of tax @-@ caring vil@@ la@@ ins , phone h@@ ack@@ ening ali@@ ens and the pseu@@ do non @-@ domestic , most of our large newspapers .
actually Tony Bla@@ ir thought about her , but realized that when you sit with a hot gor@@ illa in a cage , you better distribute ban@@ anas to distra@@ ct him instead of going to his lunch and dinner .
indeed , Mili@@ band was more Bla@@ ir than Bla@@ ir himself when he resist@@ ed Cameron &apos;s referendum , because Bla@@ ir had the principle of the EU &apos;s not passed constitution , which was then rejected by French and Dutch voters in 2005 that opened him a backdoor .
the press has never forgiven him either .
but the nice Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ n who gave me a friendly cl@@ aps on his back on Monday - I told him that he didn &apos;t need time for me - seems in danger of repe@@ ating N@@ eil Kin@@ no@@ ck &apos;s boy@@ cot@@ t Mur@@ doch &apos;s strategy of the 80 &quot; s , an error at that time and today .
it may take but he must develop a coherent strategy to win the media , not with me , but certainly with Andrew Mar@@ r , whose BBC @-@ sofa he left on Sunday .
Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s official position in Europe is - I express it friendly - in development .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says we should stay in a re@@ formed EU . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
well , most people outside of U@@ ki@@ ps &apos;s traditional blo@@ b @-@ off tendency and the wild ret@@ inu@@ e of Tor@@ ey &apos;s Klein @-@ Engli@@ sh@@ ism can say Yes .
it is what Hil@@ ary &quot; A Ben@@ n , but no B@@ enn@@ ite &quot; Ben@@ n on the radio and television this week said when the boy @-@ boy fought in him , did not admit that Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s appointment of the provo@@ king John Mc@@ Don@@ n@@ ell was a bad idea .
it reminded me of the 70 &quot; s when his old father tried to be il@@ loyal to his Labour Cab@@ inet without going too far and losing his cabinet job .
Hil@@ ar@@ ys &apos;s struggle was even more attractive .
but to fight to &quot; remain under all circumstances &quot; - B@@ enn@@ s term - was not what Mc@@ Don@@ n@@ ell said , nor what J@@ C told his comrades and de@@ pu@@ ties after all reports on their cl@@ auses on Monday evening .
whatever the stirring bottom @-@ up image of Cor@@ by@@ n wants to convey - remember that he even touched me - News @-@ discipline remains important in the era of TV round the clock and above all in the whirlpool of the social media , a ne@@ sting site of par@@ ano@@ ia and betra@@ yal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is right to give Cameron no free ticket for Europe that allows him to maintain Lab@@ ours support in the referendum campaign for a matter of course , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mc@@ Don@@ n@@ ell said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Simon J@@ enk@@ ins certainly thinks so .
but Mc@@ Don@@ n@@ ell and Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s fundamental ambig@@ u@@ ities to EU membership - in line with their B@@ enn@@ ite siege economy , their anti @-@ capitalist past - is no longer just a matter of es@@ ot@@ eric discussion among left dissi@@ dents , for which the nar@@ c@@ iss@@ ism of the small difference is a central principle of dog@@ matic disputes .
as with his ambig@@ u@@ ities to Nato - Tom Wat@@ son is sure that J@@ C does not start a campaign to leave - foreign diplom@@ ats will be obliged to try to find a sense of their superi@@ ors at home .
why should Paris or Berlin waste political capital - they also have suspi@@ cious voters - in order to make conc@@ essions to the British if all this can be sen@@ sel@@ ess ?
the US is already quite disappointed with the weak military performance in Iraq , Libya and Syria , even with a cost reduction of the T@@ ory government in power , which I was reminded on Monday by something that called British In@@ flu@@ ence Security Forum .
experts critic@@ ise Public Health Agreement on e @-@ cigar@@ ettes
claims of a government financed agency that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are less harmful than smoking originated from a meeting of 12 people , some with connections to the tobacco industry , researchers said .
experts who write in the British Medical Journal ( BM@@ J ) joined L@@ anc@@ et by critic@@ ising the evidence used by Public Health England ( P@@ he ) in their report on e @-@ cigar@@ ettes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he published the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; basic report &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; last month and describes it as a &quot; comprehensive review of the evidence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , some researchers have questioned the resili@@ ence of the data and pointed to the connections between some experts and the tobacco industry .
an editorial in the medical journal L@@ anc@@ et last month took the &quot; extra@@ ordinarily win@@ dy foundation &quot; on which he founded his most important conclusion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; two other researchers write in BM@@ J and asked whether the claims &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; build on stone or sand . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Martin Mc@@ K@@ ee , Professor of Public Health at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine and Simon Cap@@ e@@ well , Professor of Clinical Epide@@ mi@@ ology at the University of Liverpool , said : &quot; a fundamental principle of public health is that strategies should be based on proof of efficacy . &quot;
they said that the public expects that the alleg@@ ation of lease that &quot; the present best estimate is that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are about 95 % less harmful than smoking &quot; based on a detailed review of evidence and modelling .
in fact , this statement comes from a single session of 12 people who were conven@@ ed to develop a model for multiple criteria decision analysis ( Multi @-@ C@@ riteri@@ a Decision Analysis - MC@@ DA ) to lead their opinions on the damages caused by different ni@@ cot@@ ine @-@ based products to a synthesis ; the results of the meeting were summar@@ ised in a research report .
Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well said that a sponsor of the meeting was a company called Euro@@ Swiss Health , whose managing director was previously reported by British American Tob@@ acco Products ( BA@@ T ) for an independent study .
he also signed BA@@ T references to public health in a sustainability report , they said .
one of the 12 participants at the meeting explained to receive funding from an E @-@ cigarette manufacturer , but not the funding he was supposed to receive after reports previously by the tobacco company Philip Mor@@ ris International added them .
the reasons for selecting the members of the board are not delivered , but there are several well @-@ known e @-@ cigar@@ ettes champi@@ ons , some of which include a sector financing in the paper .
some other participants at this meeting are not known for their know @-@ how in tobacco control .
at the meeting also the tobacco management of P@@ he took part .
the Group &apos;s research work indicates that there is a lack of &quot; hard evidence for most products &quot; damage to most criteria , &quot; wrote Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well .
however , none of these links or restrictions are discussed in the P@@ it report .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well said that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is no evidence that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there has been no evidence that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes have been used as a way to smoke for children or non @-@ smo@@ kers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Professor Kevin F@@ enton , Director of Health and Well @-@ being at P@@ he , said that BM@@ J has already re@@ acted to the alleg@@ ations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; electric cigar@@ ettes are considerably less harmful than smoking . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
every second lifel@@ ong smo@@ ker dies at his ad@@ diction .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all evidence suggests that the health risks of e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are low in comparison , but that we continue to study long @-@ term effects . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he has the clear duty of inform@@ ing the public about what evidence shows and what is not , especially if there is so much public confusion about the relative dangers compared to tobacco .
almost 8@@ 0,000 people die every year on a disease related to smoking , and smoking costs the National Health System two billion pounds per year .
through the clear presentation of current evidence that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are not without risk , but only a fraction of the harm caused by smoking , we fulfil our national responsibility .
BBC should give up East@@ on , says former boss of Channel 4
the former chairman of Channel 4 , Luke Johnson , said that the BBC should stop sending programs like East@@ ers and The Voice . he said that commercial ri@@ vals would give their right arm &quot; for hit shows like the Albert Square So@@ ap .
Johnson said that the broadcasting fee should only be used to make the kind of programs that are not sent by other UK broad@@ cast@@ ers .
he critic@@ ised the BBC for making public j@@ uri@@ di@@ cal programs , which are likely to be seen by a smaller audience , in hard controversial time windows against the most popular shows of their ri@@ vals and of transm@@ it@@ ters such as BB@@ C4 .
after the BBC &apos;s CEO , Tony Hall , said that the company wanted to do more in partnership with other organizations , Johnson said he tried to get in touch with the BBC for six years at his time at Channel 4 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have problems with the idea that BBC programs are commissioned or sent , which would also clearly be shown by non @-@ subsidi@@ zed ri@@ vals , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Johnson to the Ober@@ haus communication committee as part of his investigation on the future of the BBC . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if you would like to keep the broadcasting fee , which I do not consider for a good idea in the medium or long term , you should at least give your production to programs that others do not make or commission .
they send The Voice in a first @-@ class time window , because they want to achieve as broad support for their future .
the idea that otherwise nobody would show it is a joke , it &apos;s ridi@@ culous , it &apos;s of course non@@ sense .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Johnson said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t see why a reg@@ res@@ sive tax fund financed , which could also be financed without subsidies . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Voice is such a program , East@@ er@@ calendar is another , ad@@ mitt@@ edly both own productions .
to be honest , other channels would give their right arm .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I must see how this should be public television . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I don &apos;t think this would reduce the BBC at all .
Johnson , an entrepren@@ eur for series who led Channel 4 from 2004 to 2010 said that the BBC is to blame for reviews &quot; because of the ambi@@ tions of people working there , and because they believe this is the best way to secure long @-@ term support . &quot;
his comments on the BBC &apos;s most popular broad@@ casts will be what the former head of Sky , Tony Ball , suggested in his Mac@@ Tag@@ gart presentation in Edinburgh in 2003 that the BBC shows how to sell East@@ ers .
Johnson said that the more public @-@ law niche programs should go to BB@@ C4 , where you can &apos;t measure the audience , but they perform their tasks , and they can argue if they go to their apparent missions to justify 4 billion broadcast fees , &quot; Well , of course , we have created all of these obsc@@ ure programs that no one has seen . &quot;
they put them in a time window in which no one ever wanted to see them .
Johnson said to the Committee on the broadcast fee : &quot; I request you to find a more reg@@ res@@ sive system in terms of conditions who can get the best value here .
of course , all of us think that one gets a great value for £ 150 a year , but for people who are a lot of money for the £ 150 per year , I wonder if that is true because they don &apos;t consume much of the BBC .
former Sky@@ - and Channel 5 boss David El@@ stein , who also testified before the Committee on Tuesday , called for the BBC to check its Rei@@ thi@@ an mission , &quot; to inform , to form and to maintain . &quot;
he said that only little of the BBC production would now officially be classified as education - he said it was 1 % of its TV production and 0.1 % on the radio - and it should take an example to the public television broad@@ cast@@ ers in Australia and Canada , for example , to &quot; inform , educ@@ ate and enter@@ tain . &quot;
to the issue of partnerships , El@@ stein said that the BBC should do more in areas like the Pro@@ ms , of which he said that only a handful of television are shown , and with the commercial broad@@ cast@@ ers Alli@@ ances enter to make it available online .
&apos;@@ Son@@ o@@ genetic &apos; can control brain cells by sound waves
the video shows how the n@@ em@@ ato@@ des change the direction in the moment they are ir@@ radi@@ ated with sound impulses .
scientists have bred worms with genetically modified nerve systems , which can be controlled by qu@@ arri@@ es of sound waves .
the tiny n@@ em@@ ato@@ des change the direction in the moment they are being be@@ amed with sound impulses that have too high frequencies for the human ear to be heard .
the impulses work through the switch @-@ on of Mot@@ on@@ eur@@ one cells , which are genetically modified in order to carry the membrane channels that respond to ultras@@ onic waves .
further to this topic : researchers read and write brain activity with light
the researchers said the worms showed the power of a new method called Son@@ o@@ genetic , in which ultrasound can be used to activate a number of brain , heart and muscle cells outside the body .
Sre@@ ek@@ an@@ th Chal@@ as@@ ani , researcher at the Sal@@ k Institute in La J@@ oll@@ a , California , said the Guardian that one day could replace the depth brain stimulation , an invasive procedure that releases electrical impulses in the brain of people to treat the symptoms of Parkinson &apos;s disease .
thread worms do not generally react to ultrasound , but Chal@@ as@@ ani found that they did it when they were surrounded by a fluid with micro@@ scopic bubbles .
the bubbles , he found out , ampli@@ fy the ultras@@ onic waves , which then penetrate into the worms .
the ampli@@ fied ultras@@ onic waves act on structures called TR@@ P @-@ 4 ion channels and found in the membranes of some of the worms cells .
the sound waves cause the opening of these ion channels and activate the cells they are assigned to , such as a report of Nature Communications .
to create ultrasound @-@ controlled n@@ em@@ ato@@ des , Chal@@ as@@ ani genetically modified the worms in such a way that some of their mot@@ on@@ eur@@ ons carry TR@@ P @-@ 4 ion channels .
when applied ultrasound to the modified creatures , the sound waves are ampli@@ fied by the micro@@ ves@@ icles and transferred to the worms , where they turn on the changed mot@@ on@@ eur@@ ons .
the procedure has some simil@@ arities with op@@ to@@ genetic , a breakthrough tool that allows scientists to turn on and off neur@@ ons with impulses of light .
but Chal@@ as@@ ani said Son@@ o@@ genetic might have some advantages over this technique .
in contrast to light , which has to be sent down to the desired position in the brain by an optical fiber , low @-@ frequency ultras@@ onic waves can pass un@@ hin@@ dered and can thus be sent to the brain from above on the skull .
&quot; we believe that with gene therapy and a therapeutic virus it is possible to make the targeted human neur@@ ons temporarily prone to the ultrasound signal in a clinical setting for certain neuro@@ logical treatments , &quot; said Chal@@ as@@ ani .
other applications could focus on muscle cells and insulin @-@ producing cells , he added .

V@@ C@@ CP Creative Director Matt L@@ ever was amazed at the silence that reigned around the advertising for the weapons fair - by a tro@@ op of the Ex@@ Ce@@ L calendar - and thought : &quot; we give them the campaign they try to avoid . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they played with the invention of a more realistic shad@@ y company advertising , but &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by the blu@@ ep@@ r@@ int with bright colors and animation it remains sti@@ cky . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they did a fantastic job by helping us raise awareness of the sale of illegal torture tools at the fair , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Tom Davi@@ es of Am@@ ne@@ sty . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
what we need now is an intervention of the British government and the guarantee that torture instruments are not illeg@@ ally tra@@ ded on our door@@ step .
perhaps the most creative art around the arms trade fair comes from within the area of Ex@@ Ce@@ L , where exhibitors will f@@ end fantastic eu@@ ph@@ em@@ istic products .

eight golden rules for living in student residen@@ ces
eleven years ago , as a self @-@ forgotten 19 @-@ year @-@ old , I moved into a student residence , still believing in Ber@@ ets and moral rel@@ ati@@ vis@@ m , but only now I remember the ten@@ se smile of those who anno@@ yed me - and to the numerous , lengthy complaints about others .
most of what I have learned can be di@@ sti@@ lled into eight simple rules .
the entrance into residence halls ranges from slightly nerve @-@ writing to absolutely terri@@ fying .
it is temp@@ ting to talk : people tell where you come from , where you come from , where you stand in terms of Cor@@ by@@ n and why you &quot; hon@@ estly said Mar@@ m@@ ite neither love nor hate , because in ear@@ nest , guys , it &apos;s just a yeast extract ha@@ ha@@ ha , I &apos;m in my room . &quot;
breathe through .
and help others to do the same - ask questions and show interest .
it distra@@ cts the conversation and helps you find out the people that you like in contrast to those with which you wouldn &apos;t speak even if your lashes were burning and these fire extingu@@ ish@@ ers would be .
let &apos;s get people .
the rooms of people often turn into drinks @-@ receptions , film @-@ night event locations and municipal hits , but they are also the places where people attract and put on their under@@ wear .
related to this : don &apos;t forget to start your university with a relationship
intro@@ vert receives a rough treatment at the university .
your room should be a refuge , but many student residen@@ ces form a space @-@ to @-@ space b@@ um@@ mel culture that is friendly and social and can lead to lifel@@ ong friendship .
this can be hell for someone who tries to recover .
nothing in culture allows you to say : &quot; I like you , and I want our friendship to continue , but you have to go away so that I get the energy that I have consumed for interaction with you . &quot;
try to feel when a fellow student is exhausted by soci@@ alizing - and send him an SMS instead of kno@@ cking .
apro@@ pos ank@@ lo@@ ping : do it .
a guy in my student residen@@ ces had the idea that an un@@ locked door was an invitation .
he saw some things .
close friendship through baking .
since you start the university at the height of the back man@@ ia , the kno@@ cking at the doors of people to imagine with a plate full of brow@@ ni@@ es is less strange than the welcome of the 1950 &quot; s &quot; welcome in the neighborhood , I &apos;ve made you a bit . so , and now please smile if I ask you a few personal questions . &quot;
offering homemade treats is a good way to make friends .
your room@@ mates feel oblig@@ ated to enter@@ tain themselves and perhaps associate your face with a delicious surprise at the end .
of course , this depends on whether you are a decent bakery .
bad mixed lum@@ ps made of flour , sugar and fat lead people sleeping when they kno@@ ck .
ste@@ aling food is a common crime in student residen@@ ces .
of course , the c@@ law of chicken is a theft , but is it taking a drop of milk for your tea also ?
check that with the milk owner .
the chances are good that they say to use themselves even when they cook inside .
if someone ste@@ als your stuff , it &apos;s annoying and you have my compassion -- but try to deal with more balanced as my room@@ mate who added a washing agent to her milk to punish thi@@ eves .
she is now in prison .
they should not make any noise that keeps people from sleep or from work .
it is not just about being a decent person , but that you belong to the people sitting in the glass house in the true sense of the saying .
a girl in my hall@@ way asked her neighbours if it makes them a bit qui@@ eter for them , because at three o &apos;clock in the morning , and she had a test in the morning .
they re@@ acted to it with more lu@@ cr@@ ative music .
when she finally heard about 5 o &apos;clock , she kindly allowed her neighbours to sleep two hours before she let her own music break , shut down her door and went to her three hour exam .
wouldn &apos;t it be romantic if your future spouse would accidentally move into the same student residence ?
conver@@ sely , it would not be deep embarrass@@ ing if you hold a room@@ mate for your future spouse to go to them , separate yourself and then see them every day and perhaps experience how they all mig@@ rate together to each other ?
of course , the heart goes its own ways - but if a hot room@@ mate is definitely not your future spouse , try at least to speak a little reason to your abdom@@ en .
in the exciting moment you notice that someone has his keys in his un@@ locked room , the border between an ul@@ k and mo@@ b@@ bing is fin@@ er than it seems .
a good stroke is funny , but it takes only moments until it becomes a bo@@ omer@@ ang .
by hiding a valuable and am@@ using lesson on security - but never compromise someone &apos;s room with tooth@@ paste and sham@@ poo .
close your door and put your keys in a glass of water that you put in the freezer - but do not t@@ ack your hol@@ dings at the ceiling more than twice .
row houses for refugees , single @-@ single , Ger@@ ing@@ Ver@@ dien@@ ne
the real estate company Markus Gil@@ bert is building row houses for people who do not have a lot of money .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in other words , for refugees , but also as a signal , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not only refugees do not need a room but also the educ@@ ating mother and the in@@ atten@@ dant . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I show how to build good and well today , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the 44 @-@ year @-@ old in an interview . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
thousands of refugees are being pushed to the housing market .
the entrepren@@ eur Markus Gil@@ bert believes in how quickly affordable housing can be created : he builds in a project in row houses for refugees .
Mr Gil@@ deb@@ tor , many refugees are being pushed to the housing market .
what solution do you offer ?
Markus Gil@@ dner : the mass housing in containers or gy@@ ms has no sustainability .
for people stay here for a great deal .
in view of the flow of refugees , we need enough space for housing in the coming decades .
a completely ban@@ al , three @-@ storey semi @-@ detached house is the solution .
Gil@@ bert : a town@@ house needs less space .
it facilitates integration .
this is different if the people are accommod@@ ated in blocks of flats .
each of the six houses , which are currently being built in the pilot project , consists of three housing units for four asylum seek@@ ers each .
each unit has two bedrooms , a bathroom , a kitchen and a common room .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it can be that many refugees will say it &apos;s peace again , I go back . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
then the houses can be easily converted according to their needs .
how high are the costs ?
guil@@ der : the price for 160 square meters of living space per house amounts to 184 000 euros , without property .
this is man@@ a@@ geable .
the construction lasted six months .
this is appropriate .
have the building regulations complicated their plans ?
Gil@@ bert : I have dra@@ gged my project properly .
it always makes the im@@ pending Dam@@ o@@ kl@@ es@@ worth special construction and the Rest@@ ri@@ ction Ord@@ in@@ ance .
sp@@ ook@@ y .
it is still sub@@ ver@@ ted , who creates three apartments in a terra@@ ced house , needs at least three pitches .
only in the cities the place is missing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; refugees and asylum seek@@ ers have no cars . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
how did local residents react to their terra@@ ced house project ?
guil@@ d : there were those who accused me of creating luxury buildings for asylum seek@@ ers .
what definitely is not true .
but do you not tigh@@ ten the competitive struggle for affordable housing ?
Gil@@ bert : true is that we had a building boom in Germany over the last five years , but we have built luxury apartments that can hardly afford any more .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my project has the message , even the normal people need living space . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
not only refugees , but also the self @-@ educ@@ ating mother or the low @-@ wage ear@@ ner .
I &apos;ll show you how to build good and well @-@ built today .
that is why it is all about .

iOS 9 : how to get the new iPhone operating system when Apple update is released
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the new operating system can be requested by going to the recruitment app , typing &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; General &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and then &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; software update &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
when ready , the phone gives you the option to download and then install .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some have encountered problems after installation , as they get an error message telling that the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; software update failed &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
to b@@ ypass the problem , users are recommended to either wait until the rush back or attempt to update via iTunes .
the phone itself leads you through the rest of the process .
this may mean del@@ eting apps to create space - but Apple has made it more likely due to the stream@@ lining of the update . likewise , it will be easier to do this if you use a special tool to delete apps and then re@@ install them once the process is completed .
it is worthwhile to ensure that your mobile phone is charged during the update or is near a charger , so that the battery is charged .
if the load is too low , Apple does not allow the update to continue , as the phone might switch to half way and could lead to a down@@ turn of the update .

Ros@@ enberg &apos;s sole motto : full attack
in the fight for the World Cup title in the Formula 1 against his clearly leading Mercedes team@@ mates , N@@ ico Ros@@ berg only knows a motto : &quot; full attack . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the World Cup second stressed in front of the start into the decisive seven overseas races , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that I have nothing to lose . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
53 points separate the vice world champion in front of the race in Singapore on this Sunday of title defender and double champion Hamilton .
the Br@@ ite already won seven of the twelve races of the season and takes the floo@@ d@@ light Grand Prix in the city state as a favourite .
in 2009 and last year , the 30 year old Brit@@ on was able to win the race .
whether the present smoke in the city state will have influence on the Grand Prix of Singapore is still unclear .

bad Kis@@ singer Schach@@ club has a prominent member
the chess club &quot; Schach@@ freunde Bad Kis@@ singen , &quot; founded three months ago , has added another member to its ranks , thus increasing the number of members to 19 players .
the new member is the entrepren@@ eur Paul G@@ aus@@ el@@ mann , a passionate chess and tennis player who stayed in Bad Kis@@ singen more than 40 times in Bad Kis@@ singen .
G@@ aus@@ el@@ mann is the carrier of the Federal Cross of Mer@@ it 1st Class and Hon@@ orary Ci@@ tizen of the cities of Esp@@ el@@ kam@@ p and L@@ üb@@ be@@ cke .
the chess club in Bad Kis@@ singen has supported G@@ aus@@ el@@ mann with a donation which chairman Alfred Klein .
this makes it possible to include chess players not able to record the membership fee .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; youth work and talent search should also be pushed forward . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
G@@ aus@@ el@@ mann wishes that membership in the chess club and also friendly contact to the tennis club &quot; Red @-@ White &quot; is seen as an expression of its connec@@ t@@ edness with the spa town .
district office seeks direct contact
Sal@@ u@@ dis and the Alten@@ zentrum Anton@@ isti@@ ft have joined forces under the man@@ tle of the Social Foundation and opened a new starting point at the Graf @-@ Stau@@ ff@@ enberg @-@ Platz .
in addition to consultations , one can also participate in courses .
the social foundation pul@@ ls it down from the mountain into the city centre .
more specifically to the Graf @-@ Stau@@ ff@@ enberg @-@ Platz .
a new district office recently opened there .
here , immediately next to the shopping market , sen@@ iors and counsel@@ ing receive information on questions such as nursing insurance or services of health and nursing funds .
for years we have established with our ambul@@ ant care service that often nour@@ ishing relatives are left alone .
there are so many questions .
&quot; not many of the services of the insur@@ ances are rarely used because the complexity of insur@@ ances is hardly understood , &quot; explained the new manager J@@ utta W@@ eig@@ and , who is also responsible for the Anton@@ isti@@ ft and the Ci@@ tiz@@ ens Hospital as well as for the out@@ patient service &quot; Ama@@ de@@ us . &quot;
in addition to the consultations , the new district office also offers prevention , health courses and wellness .
for this purpose , the Sal@@ u@@ dis was taken into the boat .
therefore , additional offers such as fall prevention , memory training or physi@@ o@@ therapeutic treatment can be used .
the offers from the senior centre and the Sal@@ u@@ dis complement each other in an ideal way .
Sal@@ u@@ dis stands for prevention , prevention and rehabilitation .
&quot; the retirement center for care and care , &quot; said Hei@@ ke R@@ ie@@ del , managing director of Sal@@ u@@ dis .
both business leaders saw the reason for the opening of the new district office in the city centre especially in demographic change .
because this is a good decentr@@ alised infrastructure in the individual districts of Bam@@ berg in the future .
in addition , mayor Wolfgang Metz@@ ner ( SPD ) under@@ lined the inauguration celebrations , dedic@@ ate himself to the club office as well : &quot; there are numerous events and offers on the agenda and these invite to a regular soci@@ able meeting . &quot;
the social foundation thus makes a big contribution to the fact that senior citizens can live as independently and well in their familiar environment .
the accommodation office is open Monday , Wednesday and Friday from 9 a.m. to 2 p.m. , Tuesday and Thursday from 16 a.m. to 6 p.m. and Satur@@ days from 10 a.m. to 12 p.m .

witnesses are looking for the police for a incident in Bad So@@ den @-@ Sal@@ mün@@ ster : on Friday evening , at 23.@@ 45 hrs , three young men were on foot from Bad So@@ den towards Sal@@ mün@@ ster .
one out of the group , a sev@@ ent@@ een year old Afgh@@ an , was following the police with his two friends at a distance of about five meters and called them to wait for him .
at that time the group was at the height of the b@@ ft gas station .
there were also three persons on the site of the gas station .
one of these men cried out to the young man and hit the face with the f@@ ist .
the victim suffered a no@@ stri@@ l of no@@ stri@@ ls and ble@@ ed heavily out of the nose .
when his two friends ha@@ st@@ ened and appe@@ aled to the bat , he first left off his sacrifice .
the injured young man was brought home by his friends .
the perpet@@ r@@ ator pursued the group with a passenger car up to the apartment and went there demonstr@@ atively several times .
when one did not see the vehicle anymore , the wounded passed in front of the building to smoke a cigarette .
there he was attacked again by the bat and another male .
with the help of a stroke , one could test on the face and thi@@ ghs of the victim .
the injured person had to be hospit@@ alized for medical care .
until now , only a vag@@ ue item description is available .
one of the men was about 1.80 meters in size .

Dr. Frank Müller acqu@@ ires the practice Fel@@ t@@ innitus and inv@@ ests 3@@ 10@@ 000 euros
Silvia Müller @-@ Gon@@ gol@@ l and Frank Müller ( from left ) take over the practice of Karl @-@ Heinrich and Ur@@ sel Fel@@ t@@ ausen .
furthermore , mayor Bernd Bor@@ mann , economic promot@@ er U@@ ta Sei@@ m @-@ Schwar@@ tz and A@@ sen@@ dorf &apos;s mayor Hein@@ fried Kab@@ bert are also pleased .
in many places in the country doctors - A@@ sen@@ dorf , on the other hand , lack luck : there Dr. Frank Müller takes over the practice Fel@@ t@@ ausen on October 1 .
while Ur@@ sel reti@@ res into retirement , her husband Karl @-@ Heinrich is still standing at half a spot for his successor in the coming months .
after a restructuring phase , Müller opens the practice on 12 October , until then he inv@@ ests 3@@ 10@@ 000 euros in the premises at St@@ .-@@ Mar@@ cell@@ us@@ strasse 6 .
it was sy@@ mp@@ a@@ thetic at first sight when the ri@@ ms were met years ago Frank Müller and his wife Dr. Silvia Müller @-@ Gon@@ gol@@ l who currently completed their specialist training at the Ver@@ den Hospital and who will also go into practice this year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we always had in mind that the mill@@ ers would fit well into this practice , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Dr. Ur@@ sel Fel@@ sei@@ ausen and laughs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; when it was so far , I simply called her . &quot;
married couple Müller liked the idea of running their own practice in A@@ sen@@ dorf in the future .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; clos@@ eness and constant contact to patients are very attractive to us , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the 39 @-@ year @-@ old Müller . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; we want to know and accompany the families over the years . &quot;
as an advantage , he also sees to be his own boss .
and so they agreed , the mill@@ ers bought the house with practice .
however , they will continue to live in Bruch@@ hausen @-@ Vil@@ sen .
the two @-@ time father Frank Müller was also raised there , his medical studies in Hanover followed stations in several medical practices as well as in hospitals in Sul@@ ingen , Ni@@ enburg and Rot@@ enburg .
he is currently working as a senior physician in Sul@@ ingen , and in 2009 he was appointed chief medical specialist in Di@@ ep@@ holz and is involved in the DR@@ K @-@ readiness of Bruch@@ hausen @-@ Vil@@ sen .
from September 19 the practice will be prepared for the new boss .
while Dr. Karl @-@ Heinrich Fel@@ t@@ innitus is a family doctor , his wife Ur@@ sel ( Inter@@ nis@@ tin ) special@@ ises in gastro@@ enter@@ ology .
the mill@@ ers , both inter@@ ne@@ sts , want to settle down as home@@ owners .
&quot; the end@@ os@@ copy therefore comes out , &quot; says the 38 @-@ year @-@ old Silvia Müller @-@ Gon@@ gol@@ l .
after the renovation the rooms look modern .
we will offer more ultrasound examinations as well as long @-@ term and stress @-@ EC@@ Gs and need a talk room more .
in addition , the ED@@ V is completely renewed .
a subsi@@ dy of 50,000 Euros will be allocated to the land@@ fill in the framework of a funding programme of the county ( 25@@ 000 Euro ) and the municipality ( 12@@ 500 Euro ) and the municipality ( 12@@ 500 euros ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this shows how proud and happy we are that the practice continues , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Samsung &apos;s Mayor Bernd Bor@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to Silvia Müller @-@ Gon@@ gol@@ l , about 2000 patients come into practice rock @-@ breaks every quarter , in the North German average practice there are around 500 .
there is another doctor &apos;s office in A@@ sen@@ dorf .
a positive side effect of the tak@@ eover by Frank Müller : according to Ur@@ sel , the pharmacy remains in A@@ sen@@ dorf .
if no successor found herself , she would have gone too .
who visits Müll@@ ers consultations , by the way also looks particularly in familiar faces : takes over the seven medical specialists and the cleaning power from the ri@@ ms .
with their par@@ ting ends in A@@ sen@@ dorf an era , after all the doctors have practi@@ sed there for 30 years .
&quot; at the beginning we had only two rooms , &quot; says Ur@@ sel Fel@@ sei@@ ausen smiling .
a little melanch@@ oly they already feel after the long time .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; her husband says laugh@@ ing : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have a 6,000 square meter plot . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so far I have always pressed myself against gardening , now it could be different . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

Croatia : &quot; we let the refugees go through &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now border controls are also raised at our southern border , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Interior Minister Joh@@ anna Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the controls at the Hungarian border remain in parallel .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; still , it is clear that anyone who wants to put an asylum application can &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the care and security of the people is in the foreground .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but it is clear , however , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that it needs clear signals , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Minister . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
people need to know that we do not accept bor@@ der@@ less migration currents , even beyond the Austrian @-@ Slovenian border .
it needs a controlled approach .
Croatia is considering &quot; corridor &quot; - Slovenia refuses
the Croatian government had previously announced that Slovenia wanted to leave the refugees arriving in the direction of Austria and Germany and , under certain circumstances , also set up cor@@ rid@@ ors for the refugees .
the interior minister Ves@@ na Gy@@ ör@@ kö@@ s Z@@ ni@@ dar in Lai@@ bach did not look like this .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the idea of cor@@ rid@@ ors is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; absolutely unacceptable , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Slovenia would rather intensi@@ fy the monitoring of the border - especially in Hungary . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the other hand , the border with Croatia is already heavily checked as the outer border of the Schengen area .
as the Minister stressed , Slovenia does not want to restrict its borders for refugees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; every member of the EU must fill out its obligations , otherwise the system can &apos;t work , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gy@@ ör@@ kö@@ s Z@@ ni@@ dar . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
as the Croatian government announced , the first refugees tried to leave in eastern Croatia at the border crossing T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik / S@@ id to avoid registration .
the Croatian police were able to attack them in the nearby corn fields .
according to local media , police vehicles with new refugees have been constantly arriving in the Croatian town of T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik .
it is primarily a matter of Syrians and Afgh@@ ans , including numerous women and children .
rescue services and the Red Cross are already in use .
in the coming days his country will reck@@ on with some 4,000 refugees , said Interior Minister R@@ ank@@ o O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic .
in addition , buses from Pres@@ evo to the Mac@@ ed@@ onian @-@ Serbian border , which had previously brought migrants to the Hungarian border , would diver@@ t Croatia and Serbian media on Wednesday .
however , the Belgrade government denied that it was for people to suggest specific routes : &quot; neither we , nor do we want to do it , &quot; was called .
according to the media reports , in the morning , a first bus with around 50 refugees arrived in the Serbian border town of S@@ id , in the course of the day more buses would be expected .
about Croatia , Slovenia and Austria to Germany
the occup@@ ants had been through Serbia the whole night away from the Mac@@ ed@@ onian border that was around 500 kilometres away .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have heard that Hungary has admitted , so the police told us that we should go here , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said one of the refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they wanted to travel to Germany through Croatia , Slovenia and Austria .
as a result , the postpon@@ ement of the previous Balkan route from Turkey @-@ Greece @-@ Macedonia @-@ Serbia @-@ Hungary could actually come to a slightly further west .
Croatia : &quot; comprehensive border control options &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Croatia &apos;s Interior Minister O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic pointed out that his country had prepared appropriate plans for possible exceptional situations in the event of a strong influ@@ x of refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he did not call for details , but he pointed out that Croatia as a non @-@ Schengen member has &quot; comprehensive limit control options . &quot;
strict controls are carried out in order to qualify for membership in the Schengen area .
Slovenia has been part of this since 2007 , the EU partners have since passed a good testimony to the country , concerning the standard of border controls .
on the Serbian side , there are still 300 refugees stuck behind the Hungarian border fence .
according to Belgrade &apos;s media reports , they had spent the past night at the border crossing of Hor@@ gos , which leads to R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke .
according to the Hungarian authorities , the two border cross@@ ings Hor@@ gos and Back@@ i Bre@@ g continue to be completely blocked .
whether the remaining refugees want to move on to the Croatian border is still unclear .
the Serbian interior minister N@@ ebo@@ j@@ sa Stef@@ an@@ ovic tried to calm down Wednesday morning with a local note in Hor@@ gos : he keeps the debates on alternative routes of refugees after the Hungarian border has now been closed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it would not be a very high number of refugees at this time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
one could not say whether they would continue their journey through Hungary , Croatia or another country .
hel@@ pers advise migrants - dangerous - alternative routes
however , private Hungarian refugees have already begun distributing maps on which alternative routes are marked by Croatia .
however , the border crossing between Serbia and Croatia is not safe : in parts of the border area there are still 20 years after the end of the Croatian war still not cleared min@@ e@@ fields .
on Wednesday afternoon the Croatian police announced that a team of mine clear@@ ers was sent to the border region .
counter h@@ ack@@ ers : Ukra@@ inians pay 30 million dollars

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the captured information inside stores will have been made on the financial markets . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in this way , a total of more than 100 million dollars were launched to the investig@@ ators .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today &apos;s comparison shows that even those outside our national borders will ultimately be caught , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says it in the SE@@ C message . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the proceedings against 32 further accused in the case continued .
most of the def@@ end@@ ants are from Ukraine and Georgia .
the perpet@@ rators are said to have acted both in the U.S. and Eastern Europe .

&quot; it &apos;s about life , so we went with the action in the middle of the city and people , &quot; says Jos@@ ef@@ ine Lam@@ mer .
the director of the E@@ cum@@ en@@ ical hos@@ pi@@ ce remedy is also available to the p@@ asser@@ s @-@ by as well as for questions and talks like the volunteers .

again and again there are little discussions on the action , about life , dealing with dying .

F@@ ed@@ Ex result mixed , financial prospects for 2016 lowered
F@@ ed@@ Ex reports dis@@ ap@@ pointing results for the last quarter , and the delivery giant lowered its profit outlook for a whole year due to the weaker demand for freight services and higher costs in its ground transport service .
the company also said that it plans to hire some 55@@ ,000 seasonal workers for the holiday .
at this time last year F@@ ed@@ Ex announced that the company would like to hire 50,000 seasonal workers for the holiday season .
the share fell by 2.5 percent in the pre @-@ market trade 45 minutes before the opening on Wednesday .
F@@ ed@@ Ex Corp. Anno@@ un@@ ces to Ear@@ n a Profit between $ 10.@@ 40 and $ 10.@@ 90 in the Financial Year that will end in May , 20 c@@ ents less than in previous forecast .
analysts hoped according to a survey of Fac@@ t@@ Set 10,@@ 84 $ .
the lower view comes despite the price increases , which amount to 4.@@ 9 percent on average and will take effect on January 4 and despite higher charges for ground transportation of heavy and large packages , which will be le@@ vi@@ ed from November onwards .
the company said that the result was nonetheless expected to increase compared to the previous year due to cost reduction , higher revenues and due to growth in online retail .
Chairman and CEO Fred Smith said that the company will generate &quot; solid income by considering the weaker than expected economic conditions , above all in manufacturing and global trade . &quot;
the plans for the vacation rental were announced a day later than that of the rival UPS , which plans to hire 9@@ 0,000 to 9@@ 5,000 additional workers , approximately the same number as last year .
in the quarter , which ended on 31 August , F@@ ed@@ Ex deser@@ ved 6@@ 92 million dollars , 6 percent more than in the previous year .
earnings per share amounted to 2.@@ 42 $ per share , just behind the 2.@@ 44 $ per share , which were forec@@ asted by T@@ ack Investment Research &apos;s twelve analysts .
sales rose by 5 percent to € 12.@@ 3 billion .
six of Z@@ ack &apos;s analysts expected $ 12.@@ 23 billion .
in recent years , F@@ ed@@ Ex has recorded a decline in international priority shipping , which resulted in sales in its unit express shipping to stagn@@ ate .
but the boom in online shopping has increased the results at F@@ ed@@ Ex Ground .
in the last quarter , sales in sheet transport rose by 29 percent , but the operating result was basically flat because of higher costs for larger packages and self @-@ insurance .
the Express unit recorded higher earnings due to higher prices , while the result was lower due to higher labor costs in the freight business .
in the pre @-@ market trade , about an hour before the opening , the F@@ ed@@ Ex shares fell by 3.@@ 85 $ , or 2.5 percent , to 15@@ 0,@@ 15 $ .
on Tuesday , they concluded with 11 percent loss for the year and 17 percent below a record high on June 11 .
at the most expected meeting in the year Federal Reserve strate@@ gi@@ sts spend two days this week around a 27 @-@ foot Hondur@@ an ma@@ ho@@ gan@@ y table to decide if it &apos;s time to raise the body for the first time for almost a decade .
a mur@@ al of the United States is im@@ min@@ ent above them at the end of the decorated two @-@ story sitting room .
the card is a reminder that the F@@ ed chair@@ woman Jan@@ et L. Y@@ ellen and her colleagues should put the economic interests of the nation in front of all other things .
the central bank has a tw@@ o@@ fold mission from Congress : keeping US employment and prices stable here .
but since the big recession , the F@@ ed leaders have acknowledged that there is an un@@ written third mandate : financial stability .
and this third mandate could be the X factor in a decision that is too narrow to predict it . it will be announced on Thursday whether the U.S. economy is ready to be reconc@@ iled by the unprecedented incentive by the close @-@ short @-@ term interest rate at the end of 2008 .
although most of the data of the economy show that it is solid , the recent tur@@ mo@@ il on the global financial markets could make the most cau@@ tious F@@ ed representatives anxi@@ ous to reinforce this volati@@ lity by raising the interest rate for federal bonds - and be it just a quarter of a percentage point .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; obviously , the labour market and inflation are primarily the most important thing they are watching , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Lind@@ sey M. Pi@@ eg@@ za , chief econom@@ ist at the bro@@ ker company Sti@@ fel Nicol@@ aus &amp; Co . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I think if they were looking for a pre@@ text to not raise interest rates , the increased uncertainty around the global market is enough justification to continue to wait , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is no consensus on what the F@@ ed will do , which insur@@ es the financial market itself .
about half of the econom@@ ists who were recently questioned by Blo@@ om@@ berg have predicted an increase in interest this week .
the financial markets , however , expect a shut@@ down of the F@@ ed , with a key indicator that only shows a 30 % chance of an increase .
this indicates a decline in the stock market , if the F@@ ed increases the proposition , unless the strate@@ gi@@ sts mi@@ tig@@ ate the blow by promising that another increase is far away .
on Tuesday , D@@ ow Jones achieved an average score of 2@@ 28@@ ,@@ 89 points or 1.4 % to 16,@@ 59@@ 9,@@ 85 .
the action was triggered by expectations that the F@@ ed policy maintains the proposition this week , said John Lon@@ ski , Chief Econom@@ ist at M@@ oo@@ dy &apos;s Capital Markets Research Group .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it would be a surprise if the F@@ ed would raise the sentences at that time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if she does it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she would have to go very far in her statement to calm the financial markets so that they don &apos;t panic . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
other experts argued that an interest rate would calm the financial markets because it would eliminate the uncertainty about when the F@@ ed would act .
a month ago , the F@@ ed seemed to increase the set by 0.@@ 25 percentage points this month , the first small step in a slow tigh@@ tening of monetary conditions that would test the strength of recovery in the US .
Y@@ ellen had said in spring and early summer that this year , despite the complaints of liber@@ als that more economic progress would be required , an increase in the sentence was anticipated .
although job creation slow@@ ed in August , the improvement in the labour market was solid this year .
the unemployment rate dropped to 5.1 % last month , the lowest for over seven years and near the level that the F@@ ed sees as full employment .
wage increases have shown signs of recovery .
and although inflation was constantly below the target of 2 % of the central bank , the F@@ ed representatives said that the main reason is the temporary effect of significantly lower oil prices .
the economy &quot; can handle higher interest rates and needs it because of tension on the labour market , &quot; said Ian Sh@@ ep@@ her@@ dson , Chief Econom@@ ist at Pan@@ the@@ on Macro@@ economics .
but the financial markets all over the world sent together at the end of the last month , after China had de@@ valued its currency .
the D@@ ow Jones Industrial A@@ verage Rate fell by more than 16 % in May , as investors feared that a slow@@ down of the Chinese economy would throt@@ tle global growth .
the market has recovered slightly this month , whereas the D@@ ow is now around 10 % below the pole of May .
for the F@@ ed representatives , the market turbul@@ ences affect the complex calculation when to increase interest rates .
&quot; if the events on the financial markets and the news on the weakness of the Chinese economy had not occurred in the past few weeks , they would attract the re@@ ins at this meeting , &quot; said Stephen D. O@@ liner , Senior Research Fel@@ low at U@@ C@@ LA Zim@@ an Center for Real Estate and a former staff of the US Central Bank .
now he predic@@ ts that she will wait at least a month to get a better grip on the effects .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is a lot of uncertainty about what the impact on the US economy will be , and there are almost no reliable data describing the developments in China , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said O@@ liner . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the world economy &apos;s health is not one of the main concerns of the F@@ ed , so it should not be involved in the decision @-@ making process .
but in the end the F@@ ed became the world &apos;s F@@ ed currency .
the influence of the central bank was enormous in recent years .
the mere indication of the former director Ben S. Bern@@ anke in 2013 , that the F@@ ed could &quot; narrow down her monetary expansion , &quot; caused confusion around the globe .
in a world where markets and economies are increasingly inter@@ tw@@ ined , the F@@ ed representatives are expected to not only monitor developments at another place , but also consult other central banks and experts to gain a better understanding of the global economy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; their decision @-@ making is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; more art than science , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Zach@@ ary Kar@@ ab@@ ell , head of the global strategy for asset management of En@@ v@@ est@@ net Inc . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Jeff@@ rey Lack@@ er , President of the Federal Reserve Bank of Rich@@ mond , VA . , noted this month that &quot; the F@@ ed has a history of transactions on financial market movements that apparently are not associated with economic fundament@@ als . &quot;
Lack@@ ner , Member of the Federal Open Market Committee , who advoc@@ ates an increase in interest , cited decisions in the years 1998 / 1999 as an example .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a financial crisis in Asia led the F@@ ed to reduce its interest rate by 0.@@ 75 percentage points in three sessions &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; despite a limited apparent impact on growth in the US , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Lack@@ ner said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
one year later , the F@@ ed representatives vo@@ iced these cuts .
the F@@ ed should put all aspects of financial stability to the first place during a serious crisis as the 2008 Mark@@ tz@@ us@@ flash@@ broke , said Adam S. P@@ osen , former member of the Committee on Inter@@ est Sav@@ ings Bank of England .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the latest turbul@@ ence does not come close to this level , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she certainly doesn &apos;t want to get into the situation in which she is afraid of an increase in interest because markets are upset , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said P@@ osen , President of the Peter@@ son Institute for International Economics . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Federal Reserve Act still contains the double mandate and does not mention financial stability , and until it is amended , I do not believe it should be ahead of time .

Brazil &apos;s pedi@@ at@@ ric society Rio Grande promotes nutrition for healthy breast@@ feeding
Brazilian pa@@ edi@@ at@@ ric organization SP@@ RS tries to clarify women in a sho@@ cking way how important good nutrition is during breast@@ feeding . it does this with the presentation of images of babies who su@@ ck at breasts that are painted with depic@@ tions of un@@ healthy foods .
breast milk consists of a variety of proteins , fats , vitamins and carbohydrates that give babies all the nutrients they need to build a strong immune system .
due to the additional energy requirements , pregnant and young mothers are advised to increase their daily calorie intake by about 500 calories per day .
however , new research suggests that higher calorie intake is not the only dietary modification that mothers should do .
a recent study conducted by Robert Water@@ land , Professor at the Bay@@ lor College of Medicine in Texas , showed that a healthy diet of pregnant women actually affects the genes of their babies and protects them from the development of tumours .
unfortunately , an un@@ healthy diet of the child can adver@@ sely affect the immune system .

the plans for the long @-@ awa@@ ited Turn@@ halle Building at the Bern@@ rie@@ der Sport@@ welt are progres@@ sing step by step : in the recent council meeting , the revised construction application was unanim@@ ously approved without major discussions .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; exception &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was the permit for a special form concerning the roof construction . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
accordingly , a &quot; saddle roof with a non @-@ centered ridge and roof top &quot; should be erected .
background of the planning is the intended use of the roof area for solar systems : &quot; in this way we get a wonderfully large south roof together , &quot; stated Mayor Josef St@@ eigen@@ berger in the meeting .
at &quot; Liber@@ ation &quot; the roof inclin@@ ation , which for energy reasons , was to be below ten degrees , differently than in the planning plan .
this significantly reduces the volume of the hall .
a &quot; liberation &quot; was therefore necessary because the plan for the development of the roof does not allow &quot; exceptions , &quot; whereby the municipality of Bern@@ rie@@ der generally does not drive restric@@ tively in the case of liber@@ ating orders .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , this is not a recurring project : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we do not create a preced@@ ent , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; St@@ eigen@@ berger said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the gym building at the Sports Centre is a joint project of the municipality and the S@@ V Bern@@ ried .
at a cost some 2.3 million euros are calculated .
subsidies are expected to be funded by school and broad@@ band sponsor@@ ships .
in the next step , the building application for the 18 x 36 metres large hall will now be presented to the district council office for testing .
clinic P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg moves to Sch@@ ong@@ au
the P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg Hospital is planned to be closed earlier than planned - in 2016 .
at the same time , Dr. Wilhelm Fischer ( 66 ) will become the new Medical Director at the Sch@@ ong@@ au Hospital .
the station and the majority of the employees move from P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg to Sch@@ ong@@ au .
these are the surprising plans of the hospital GmbH of the county , confirmed by the coun@@ sell@@ ors Andrea J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiß .
however , a decision on this will meet the Supervisory Board and the next Wednesday , 23 September .
should the plans be implemented , then all of the nearly 50 staff would be employed at the hospital in P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg .
the vast majority should move to Sch@@ ong@@ au with Fischer and the further existing In@@ ner Station .
the rooms are available .
the employees who cannot come to Sch@@ ong@@ au should be offered a workplace in Wei@@ l@@ heim , says J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiß .
the employees are informed about the plans .
the change has triggered the termination of Dr. Andreas E@@ der , who has been the Medical Director of the Sch@@ ong@@ au Clinic since the beginning of the year and now changes to a private practice in close proximity to the hospital .
according to J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiß , the name &quot; Fischer , &quot; who agreed to take over the lead from October 1 , was asked to take over the lead and to switch to Sch@@ ong@@ au with his team .
for the house in Sch@@ ong@@ au this rep@@ ented in every case an &quot; appreciation &quot; and a wi@@ dening of the offer in the field of &quot; Internal Medicine , &quot; says J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiß .
Fischer is a specialist for pac@@ em@@ akers and de@@ fi@@ bri@@ ll@@ ators .
Sch@@ ong@@ au ( 180 beds ) is specialized in gastro@@ enter@@ ologic illnesses at the inner stop .
for the next two years , Fischer and his team are expected to have both houses , until next year the former hospital of the no@@ d@@ ship , which has more than 35 beds , will finally be closed in P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg after almost 140 years .
until now , the county has planned this for 2018 if the current refur@@ bish@@ ment at the Wei@@ l@@ heim Hospital has been completed .
district coun@@ cill@@ or J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiß , who is also chairman of the Supervisory Board , met rum@@ ors that the house , which is owned by the Federal Co@@ unc@@ ill@@ or , should be used as an accommodation for asylum seek@@ ers in the future .
&quot; I conclude that . &quot; as it goes on with the property , J@@ och@@ ner @-@ White could not say , there are several considerations .
currently there are a short @-@ term care of the Car@@ itas and a day@@ time psychiat@@ ry .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what better could not happen to us , such an opportunity does not come back , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Fischer on the quasi @-@ move to the Le@@ ch , which was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; positive and very sy@@ mp@@ a@@ thetic &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there was no real perspective for the house where Fischer has been working as a chief physician for more than 30 years .
he was asked by Sch@@ ong@@ au &apos;s colleagues to take over the post of the medical director .
the hospital P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg ( once 100 beds ) was again and again threatened by closure in recent decades , departments were closed , for example surgery and obst@@ et@@ rics .
the hand b@@ aller of the Rhein @-@ Neck@@ ar lions are required tonight ( 20.@@ 15 pm ) at the Berg@@ ische HC .
although the championship leader of the Bundes@@ lig@@ a is the clear favourite in Wuppertal , there is no reason for arro@@ gan@@ ce .
in the past season , the Bad@@ ener took a painful defeat at Bh@@ c and got something good there .
hunting event with two injured at Pr@@ at@@ au
two tractor drivers have been seriously injured during their ma@@ ize harvest on Tuesday afternoon by shots .
during the super@@ sti@@ tion on a corn field near Pr@@ at@@ au ( Land@@ kreis Witt@@ enberg ) several h@@ unters were in use , as the police informed .
after a shot , a 63@@ th and a 22 year old man suffered severe injuries and were brought to hospital .
how exactly it could come to the accident was not clear at first .
the crime police identified .
missing 16 @-@ year @-@ old from Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate victims of violent crimes
a suspect has led the police to the cor@@ p@@ se of the 16 @-@ year @-@ olds of Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate missing since Saturday .
in inter@@ ro@@ gation , the 20 @-@ year @-@ old admitted that the young people were killed and their bodies thrown into a channel in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen .
a 16 @-@ year @-@ old from Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate , which has been missing since Saturday , has fallen victim to violence .
the body of the young woman was found on Tuesday evening in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen near Kais@@ ers@@ lau@@ tern , including public prosec@@ ut@@ ors and police on Wednesday .
the 20 @-@ year @-@ old arrested on Tuesday evening is also considered to be active , according to the facts alleged and the investig@@ ators were leading to the discovery site of the cor@@ p@@ se .
the 16 @-@ year @-@ old had been reported missing on Sunday morning after having arrived at home in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen on the eve of a visit to an autumn festival in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen .
when searching for the young woman , the investig@@ ators first met personal objects of the victim .
in the event of inter@@ ro@@ g@@ ations in the circle of friends and acquain@@ tan@@ ces of the mis@@ chief , there was finally an act of action against the 20 @-@ year @-@ old .
the alleged perpet@@ r@@ ator then led the police to a channel in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen , where the body was found .
according to the authorities , the det@@ ain@@ ee told the authorities to kill the 16 @-@ year @-@ old and put the cor@@ p@@ ses into the canal .
the 20 @-@ year @-@ old was to be presented on Wednesday to the prison , the investig@@ ators lay hands on him .
information on the near@@ er circumstances of the act is intended to bring further investigations .
refugees need accommodation : study warns of housing gap
the location on the German housing market is ten@@ se .
more and more refugees are looking for a affordable stay .
pressure on the housing market is growing .
social housing is faced with a challenge .
the distribution campaigns on the German housing market have long since begun .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the arriving refugees and job seek@@ ers from the EU , more and more people are pushing for a market that is already over@@ loaded in many big cities . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they compete with low @-@ income citizens around the last affordable housing .
in order to meet the demand for affordable housing , 400@@ ,000 new units have to be built by 2020 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the result of a study commissioned by the association &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; social housing construction . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for comparison , 26@@ 0,000 units will be finished in Germany this year .
with this , 14@@ 0,000 apartments are missing .
after the first three months of their stay , refugees are no longer obliged to live as asylum seek@@ ers in an accommodation unit .
many then meet the housing market and lined up in the long queu@@ es in front of the apartment rentals .
according to the Federal Statisti@@ cal Office , however , less than half of all asylum seek@@ ers stayed for rent last year .
however , the negative development of the housing market is not only due to the increasing number of refugees .
the study also makes significant om@@ is@@ sions in the housing policy of recent years .
Germany hi@@ des an apartment deficit that becomes larger from year to year .
currently , around 77@@ 0,000 residential units were missing in the b@@ ale areas , compl@@ ains Matthias Günther , author of the study .
many working people therefore lived in big cities in need of WG @-@ rooms .
because of the lau@@ ts on the housing market young adults remained invol@@ un@@ tarily longer in the &quot; Hotel Mama . &quot;
in the big cities , the number of square meters per cap@@ ita has declined for the first time in recent years .
in order to solve the problem , the Alliance &quot; Social Res@@ idential Building &quot; proposes a re@@ boot .
new incentives are intended to boost social housing construction .
in this way , the property tax could be dispens@@ ed with and the property tax for subsi@@ dis@@ ed dwell@@ ings will be suspended for a limited time .
in addition , attractive tax amor@@ tis@@ ation options are necessary according to the Alliance .
the funding programme for refugee shel@@ ters of state bank Kf@@ W is already well received by cities and municipalities .
a good week after the start , more than half of the available around 300 million euros had already been raised on Monday evening with 184 million euros .
now the project could even be increased .
refugees have free validity : Croatia and Slovenia meet corridor
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is practically no transit to Hungary , as more and more refugees choose their way across Croatia . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Zagreb canc@@ els transit across Slovenia to the north without hur@@ d@@ les .
but the route is dangerous .
Croatia wants to communicate with Slovenia on the establishment of a cor@@ rid@@ ors for refugees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have spoken with the Slovenian interior minister and if necessary we will organise a corridor , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Croatian Interior Minister R@@ ank@@ o O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Slovenia is located between Croatia and Austria and is already part of the Schengen zone .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the EU country Croatia is not yet a Schengen country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to the Serbian @-@ Hungarian border , hundreds of refugees came to Croatia to get to Western Europe from there .
500 people have come across the border at T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik , reported by the Croatian television station RT@@ L .
on the eve of the day Hungary had closed off its border for refugees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; new laws , which came into force on the same day , also render regular asylum procedures in Hungary superf@@ lu@@ ous . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Croatia wants to let the refugees pass .
the Croatian Prime Minister Zor@@ an Mil@@ an@@ ovic stated : &quot; you can travel through and we are preparing for that opportunity . &quot;
these people are there , there are women , children and men who want to live and achieve something .
however , people who did not want to live in Croatia .
in the morning the Croatian police attacked the first refugees on Serbia &apos;s border to the EU neighbouring country .
most of the media reports are reported from Syria , Iran and Afghanistan .
they came to the Serbian border town of S@@ id , both by bus and taxis .
immediately after their arrival , they would have tried to walk across the green border to Croatia .
at the Croatian @-@ Serbian border , the refugees do not meet fen@@ f@@ ences .
for this the border strip contains other dangers : there are still sharp mines from the Yugosla@@ vian civil war in the 90 &apos;s .
mine clear@@ ers should now quickly create a safe passage .
however , after the closure of the border , no more refugees come to Hungary .
on Tuesday , the police numbered 3@@ 66 people .
shortly before the closing time on Monday , it had been 9@@ 380 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the new Hungarian laws en@@ force the overcoming and damage of the border zone as a crime . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the South @-@ Hungarian border town Sz@@ eg@@ ed , 35 criminal proceedings were therefore initiated .
convic@@ ted pen@@ alties thre@@ aten up to five years and deport@@ ation from the country .
according to the immigration authority , a total of 94 asylum applications were received on Tuesday in the &quot; Tran@@ sit on &quot; border , of which almost all - 93 - at the most important transition are R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke .
among the applicants are 13 families with small children and two older people .
on Wednesday morning there had been 40 refugees there .
practically no one has the prospect of granting asylum in Hungary .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Hungarian terms , Serbia is a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; secure third country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the rejected asylum seek@@ ers shall be de@@ ported there .
only a few hundred refugees gathered in front of the &quot; transit zone &quot; in R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke .
workers began to clean up in R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke .
they collected the garbage that tens of thousands of people had left at the road@@ side in the last weeks .
barriers were broken down and one of the recording camps at the border was rebuilt .
nobody wanted to comment on the purpose of this reconstruction .
after the closure of the border between Serbia and Hungary , Austria only reaches a few refugees .
the country has also strengthened its border controls .
but around 20,000 migrants still remained in the country according to government information .
in Salzburg , about 1400 people are waiting for the journey to Germany .
the train traffic from there to Germany was stopped by the German authorities in the morning .
in Frei@@ las@@ sing regularly smaller groups of refugees arrived on foot .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mayor ro@@ de &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ge@@ str@@ and@@ ete &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; across the border &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we were occupied by the Brück@@ en@@ fest on Sunday with the clean up , when suddenly ten people were standing at the entrance of the tent , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said W@@ ern@@ st@@ eins Mayor Alo@@ is Stad@@ ler . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
tourists , they wanted to train to Passa@@ u .
because Germany had surprisingly stopped rail traffic with Austria on Sunday because of the influ@@ x of refugees , Stad@@ ler , who immediately offered his help and drew the border together with two other hel@@ pers and their cars across the border into Nah@@ e Passa@@ u .
before we first ta@@ sted the unexpected guests , with snack and drink .
we said the same , we bring them to Passa@@ u by car .
&quot; that was a matter of course for us , &quot; said Stad@@ ler in the O@@ Ö@@ N interview .
they were very grateful .
a man did not let him take a generous donation - 100 Euro for the fire bri@@ g@@ ade .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this has been very much appreciated , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Stad@@ ler . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the str@@ anded train passengers on Sunday evening in W@@ els switched from an ICE into a regional train in the direction of Passa@@ u , after the short notice that the rail traffic was set to Germany , but still trying to cross the border .
but the regional train was turned off at the border in W@@ ern@@ stein am Inn .
in W@@ ern@@ stein , the cross @-@ border crossing is generally high in the course .
the Brück@@ en@@ fest association with the Bavarian neighbours on sun@@ day was soci@@ able , on the day before a brid@@ le run sporty - organized by the Union W@@ ern@@ stein and Bavaria from Neu@@ kirchen .
that Viktor Or@@ b@@ án will now send thousands of thousands to us is a logical result of hypo@@ critical politics :
instead of helping to establish structures in the R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke camp immediately in the establishment of structures , our German Chancellor has publicly moved the position of the Hungarian government into the m@@ ist circle of National Socialism .
the leaders of this policy are not only those Austri@@ ans who are now confronted with cha@@ otic conditions in the border regions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; also the refugees will have to find that the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; praised land &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which she has invited and welcomed , is nothing but another refugee camp . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it will be a great challenge in the face of the ongoing refugee streams and the approaching winter to make decent conditions for asylum seek@@ ers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and there will be an even greater peace , security and stability in Austria . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Konrad looking for 35@@ ,000 winter @-@ proof quarters
Konrad , with the provision of refugees , has to do all his hands full .
Christian Konrad is used to the fact that his word has weight .
the government has used the former mighty Rai@@ ff@@ eisen bank@@ ers to set up lod@@ gings for the thousands of refugees .
the chaos in the tak@@ eover center of Tra@@ is@@ kirchen has already gotten a grip on Konrad .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have no homeless more in Tra@@ is@@ kirchen , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he told his first success . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the accommodation of the 20,000 refugees who had come to Austria on Monday , said Konrad , praised the organizational &quot; master performance . &quot;
the Ministry of Internal Affairs , on the other hand , spoke of a &quot; crisis @-@ like situation . &quot;
in total , Konrad expects a demand of 8@@ 5.000 quarters in the he@@ ur@@ igen year .
in order to meet the number , 35@@ ,000 establishments have to be found in the next few weeks - 20.000 are to provide the federal states , 15,000 of the federal government .
if there are more refugees , we can create it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but there is no drum without ground , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Konrad said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he has already held talks with the main govern@@ ors .
they would have assured him to create lod@@ gings for the coming refugees .
&quot; it goes well in Upper Austria , &quot; said Fer@@ ry Ma@@ ier .
the former VP @-@ Mand@@ at@@ ar supports Konrad .
tomorrow there will be a meeting with Cardinal Christoph Schön@@ born , and it will be clear how the Church will help .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the asylum coordinator puts great expectations also in the ORF action &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hel@@ ping as we &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the platform private individuals can easily offer accommodation .
in addition , it is hoped for hotels that are empty during the winter .
yesterday , Konrad and Ma@@ ier critic@@ ised the standards for placing as &quot; very high . &quot;
in times of emergency it could not be that arti@@ sans do not have to comply with a certain amount of the towel @-@ holders or the size of the duties .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for a temporary period , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; emergency standards &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; would have to apply . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Konrad , with his experience , founded that he was more successful in contrast to the Interior Ministry when he was accommod@@ ated .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am an elderly gent@@ leman , whom one does not say without another in the face of fal@@ seh@@ ood . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
persu@@ asi@@ veness is his most important weapon .
Konrad and Ma@@ ier do not cause the Republic to cost as they themselves declared .
they want to increase their number of employees to three to four .
so far , my own quest for qu@@ arti@@ ders has not been successful .
Konrad wanted to place a container at the Stephan@@ splatz as an office .
but there are obviously problems with hom@@ olog@@ ation .
Linz demands a better division
for the moment no opening of urban sports halls and other buildings such as Tips @-@ Arena and Design Center for the placing of refugees is planning the city of Linz .
this is not necessary at the moment , as the persons concerned can be accommod@@ ated without these measures , &quot; says Mayor Klaus Lu@@ ger ( SP ) .
in case of an emergency , further sites should be tested for their suitability .
the mayor also critic@@ ises the distribution of refugees within the federal state .
other districts too must make their contribution here .
Seeh@@ of@@ er : &quot; boundaries are not sealed &quot;
in a longer phone call with the Bavarian prime minister Horst Seeh@@ of@@ er ( CS@@ U ) , Gover@@ nor Josef P@@ ühr@@ inger ( VP ) announced further action in the refugee issue on Monday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Seeh@@ of@@ er has assured me that the German borders are not sealed off . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the further journey of refugees to the Federal Republic is still possible .
however , there are now the corresponding border controls .
there will be no more special trains with refugees in Germany for the time being .
however , the asylum seek@@ ers would be brought to Germany by regular trains .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from the other EU member states , P@@ ühr@@ inger once again called for greater solidarity in the refugee issue . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the fact that Austria is again introducing controls at its borders is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a logical consequence &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from the action of the Germans . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the next Run@@ t@@ astic is a Mat@@ ter of Time
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the general refur@@ bish@@ ment of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; new shi@@ py@@ ard &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the liner industrial line is officially closed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in four of the six floors of the office and production building , the publicly listed IT Group has moved into S &amp; T , the rest ( 27@@ 00 square metres ) is to be le@@ ased to young , innovative companies from the technology sector .
&quot; in IT , smart minds are our raw material - and we have to try to work for us , &quot; says S &amp; D leader Hannes Nieder@@ haus@@ er .
he could imagine investing in the start @-@ up companies of the new shi@@ py@@ ard and later also to acquire some of them .
already from the very beginning S &amp; T wants to cooperate with the new neighbours - from which Nieder@@ haus@@ er promises a lot : &quot; the next Run@@ t@@ astic is just a matter of time . &quot;
Euro 1.7 million was invested by S &amp; T , 3.3 million euros from the Tech@@ Center , which is one third of the city of Linz , the land of Upper Austria and the Bund ( FF@@ G ) .
the building is le@@ ased by the Linz AG for 60 years at S &amp; T and Tech@@ Center .
30 percent of the 27@@ 00 square meters remaining space in the building are already rented , for another 40 percent there are requests .
Li@@ a @-@ Per@@ oni @-@ owner opened second business in the arcade
the new shop will focus on Fur@@ la hand@@ bags .
actually J@@ utta Br@@ eit wanted to get a dog .
this project had to push the 49 year @-@ old owner of Li@@ a Per@@ oni in the do@@ ve market of the Tau@@ ben@@ markt @-@ Ark@@ ade . finally , she got an increase in the form of a further business district .
in the Fur@@ la @-@ Shop opposite the shop , where it sells among other things bags , suit@@ cases , shoes and garments from various manufacturers , everything revol@@ ves around women &apos;s hand@@ bags of the brand Fur@@ la , pur@@ ses are starting from 75 euros .
larger bags and accessories cost up to 500 euros .
the new shop has been in operation since yesterday .
previously several weeks have been re@@ developed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I have long considered whether I should open a shop , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Br@@ eit . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the deciding factor for the decision was , among other things , that the Fur@@ la producers , who are at home in Bologna , were delighted with the idea of an own site where only their hand@@ bags were sold .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are the only ones in Greater Linz that sell this brand , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the mother of two daughters who even has Italian roots . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
her fashion interest has been placed in the cra@@ dle from her mother .
I like most if something develops and I can show new trends at affordable prices .
why some women are in rap@@ tures at the sight of a beautiful hand@@ bag , the expert can &apos;t answer with last security .
maybe it &apos;s because a beautiful bag enhances every outfit .
the Br@@ ull@@ j@@ es@@ macher from K@@ all@@ stadt
the Pal@@ at@@ inate ancestors of Donald Tr@@ ump came from a place whose inhabitants are called An@@ ders .
some people also associate this feature with the billi@@ on@@ aire , who wants to become US president .
Donald Tr@@ ump ( 69 ) is always good for up@@ sets .
whether it is alien@@ ated , journalists ru@@ de or reveal knowledge gaps in the international crisis policy - the candidate for the US pres@@ idency will che@@ er up the campaign .
and cut off well .
this is also recorded in the Pal@@ at@@ inate K@@ all@@ stadt , where the grand@@ parents of the estate billi@@ on@@ aire come from .
the New Yorker with the F@@ öhn@@ fresh@@ ur is a term for many in the Win@@ zer@@ dorf on the wine route .
some in the 1200 inhabit@@ ant town is related to him over -@@ zig corners .
his grandfather came from K@@ all@@ stadt in the Pal@@ at@@ inate : Donald Tr@@ ump , here in campaign mode .
the K@@ all@@ städ@@ ter Sim@@ one Wen@@ del turned a film about Tr@@ ump .
and what do the vill@@ agers think about being the most powerful man in the world ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think they find it exciting , but are not so deeply impressed in their K@@ all@@ stad@@ ter way , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Sim@@ one Wen@@ del . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the native of K@@ all@@ stadt has filmed an am@@ using documentary about the place and his famous children , including Tr@@ ump also the K@@ et@@ ch@@ up family Heinz counts .
Tr@@ ump , who is not known for hum@@ ility , comes to word in &quot; Kings of K@@ all@@ stadt &quot; ( 2014 ) - so with the statement that he would surely be successful if he would live in K@@ all@@ stadt .
he did not bring it to the king of the hearts .
although there is a respect for the performance of the family , I also tend to think Tr@@ ump is &quot; a mou@@ th@@ piece , &quot; Wen@@ del says .
coinci@@ dentally , the nick@@ name , K@@ all@@ stadt , l@@ ur@@ king in a circum@@ ference , &quot; The Br@@ ull@@ j@@ es@@ macher &quot; - in High German : the investors , they say .
Tr@@ ump proceeds from the village of the don@@ ors .
the Tr@@ ump &apos;@@ sche success story began in 18@@ 85 when the later grandfather emig@@ rated and opened a restaurant for gold dig@@ gers in the USA .
the corner@@ stone of the real estate company was the first purchase of land in New York .
but the life of the grand@@ parents was not free from tragedy : their desire to return to their homeland in the long run failed in the Bavarian state to which the Pal@@ at@@ inate belonged at that time .
he did not record Tr@@ ump because he was once without permission , the director of the Institute of Pal@@ at@@ inate History and Volk@@ sk@@ unde , Roland Paul , declared the start of the film .
Tr@@ ump is the grand@@ son of an illegal emig@@ rant .
this contrasts with the sometimes marked statements of the descend@@ ant .
he had repeatedly talked about Mexican immigrants in the US and demanded the construction of a boundary wall to deter illegal immigrants .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not so pleasant , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Hans @-@ Joachim Ben@@ der , a distant relative Tr@@ um@@ ps ( &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The grand@@ ma was a born tr@@ ump , the grand@@ pa was born Heinz &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the v@@ int@@ ner in retirement looks rather distant from the American , &quot; he is always so enthusiastic . &quot;
does he believe Tr@@ ump arrives ?
&quot; I can &apos;t imagine that , &quot; says the 72 @-@ year @-@ old .
&quot; he never cared about K@@ all@@ stadt . &quot;
the pension vor@@ tex Ver@@ oni@@ ka Sch@@ ra@@ mm men@@ tions like many K@@ all@@ stad@@ ters that a descend@@ ant of the Heinz family donated something for the church organ during a visit , which is generally well anch@@ ored .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I can &apos;t imagine this by Donald &apos;s , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the 68 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they find it better if he didn &apos;t win the election because &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he has such radical views , I don &apos;t know if that &apos;s good . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if those who had the sa@@ wing at the time of his grandfather in the US would have been like him , &quot; he would never have arrived there . &quot;
&quot; there are more interesting themes than him , &quot; says Win@@ zer@@ ra@@ chter Sarah Büh@@ ler .
and as president ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my President is not , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the grapes are ripe without the president Tr@@ ump . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

seven &apos;s Sunrise domin@@ ates the reviews , despite attempts by N@@ ine to take over the loss of leadership in the Today Show
Karl Stef@@ an@@ ovic and Lisa Wil@@ kin@@ son ha@@ sten to Can@@ ber@@ ra to report to the loss of leadership of the liber@@ als , but there has been no major shifts in the Today &apos;s reviews .
the N@@ ine &apos;s breakfast show was broadcast by the federal capital , when Mal@@ col@@ m Turn@@ bull shot the fall of Tony Ab@@ bot@@ t .
the Ri@@ val Sunrise , with the hosts David Koch and Sam@@ anth@@ a Ar@@ my@@ tage , was part of a week @-@ long series of international TV shows , including Dubai , New York , Niag@@ ara Falls and Can@@ cu@@ n .
this down@@ side of the distance seemed to play no role for Australian TV viewers , since sunrise achieved an average of 39@@ 7@@ ,000 spectators in the five major cities , compared to today &apos;s 33@@ 9@@ ,000 .
today , Today recorded a slight increase over ratings for Monday ( 3@@ 17@@ ,000 ) and last Tuesday ( 28@@ 3,000 ) , but its number was lag@@ ging behind the last Thursday ( 34@@ 3,000 ) .
today , the gap to Sunrise was closed during the last months .
in August , Today reached an average of 3@@ 18@@ ,000 compared to the 33@@ 0,000 of Sunrise .
at the beginning of the year the distance was between 40,000 and 50.000 .
until now in September , sunrise at an average of 34@@ 9@@ ,000 viewers is at 3@@ 14.@@ 000 at Today .
this is the most interesting thing that happens every morning .

the great news for Seven was the impressive debut of 800 words with the former series of Pack@@ ed to the Raf@@ ters Erik Thom@@ son .
the new drama about a recently weather@@ ed father , who decides to settle with his two children on New Zealand &apos;s coast , reached a very impressive figure of 1.@@ 2@@ 19 million viewers .
critics asked if Thom@@ son could wear a hit show solo without the Raf@@ ters Star Rebecca Gib@@ ney .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the result of yesterday evening responded with a clear &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Yes &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the X @-@ Factor of Seven stayed strongly with 1.@@ 136 million viewers and hit The Block ( 8@@ 3@@ 8.000 ) and T@@ BL Family ( 7@@ 26@@ ,000 ) .
seven had mixed results in evening two of The Ch@@ ase Australia .
the first half hour ( 17 : 00 to 17 : 30 ) is the new quiz show presented by Andrew O &apos;@@ Ke@@ ef@@ e on average 44@@ 6.000 spectators .
the second half hour ( 17 : 30 to 18 : 00 ) j@@ umped to 6@@ 23@@ ,000 spectators - enough for a small victory over Ed@@ die Mc@@ Gu@@ ires Hot @-@ Se@@ at ( 6@@ 13@@ ,000 ) .
on Monday evening , the first half hour of The Ch@@ ase Australia achieved 5@@ 20,000 spectators and in the second half an hour was 7@@ 20,000 .
hot @-@ Se@@ at on average 6@@ 20.000 .
the decline in quot@@ as for the second evening of The Ch@@ ase Australia will make N@@ ine confident that the hot seed will ultimately prevail at 17 : 30 .
the Ch@@ ase Australia is a replacement for a million dollar minute that did not manage to over@@ run the Mc@@ Gu@@ ires show .

the final three agree : Bachelor &apos;s Sam Wood is the perfect man - but who will he choose ?
secret revealed ? ...
L@@ ana Je@@ ann@@ on Fel@@ lows , Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay and S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana Mark@@ os@@ ki probably have un@@ wit@@ t@@ ingly revealed who the Bachelor wins .
the woman , at which Sam Wood eventually lands in The Bachelor , was wrapped in the greatest sec@@ rec@@ y .
and none of the three remaining girls will certainly not reveal if she is the one who received the last rose .
but when we checked with Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay , S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana Mark@@ os@@ ki and L@@ ana Je@@ ann@@ on Fel@@ lows on the day before being made up of three , you may have accidentally given a hint of who will be the winner .
Sam Wood closes his lips to the final on Thursday
all three women have a ly@@ rical way of why Wood is the perfect man and called his sense of hum@@ our , ambition , family values and positive attitude as reasons why they would like to be his partner .
however , if the question is asked , &quot; If not you , who should receive W@@ oods last rose , &quot; could be their answers to the game of players who won the heart of the Bach@@ el@@ ors .
everyone named Je@@ ann@@ on Fel@@ lows and Mark@@ os@@ ki both quickly - except themselves - M@@ ack@@ ay as the best partner for Wood .
the first day Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay and Sam Wood have had a simple relationship with each other .
&quot; from the moment I went to the house and noticed ( Sarah &apos;s ) and Sam@@ s energies , I felt that they were quite compatible and I thought it was quite compatible throughout the show , &quot; said Je@@ ann@@ on Fel@@ lows .
Sarah is standing on earth with both feet , making it so much fun to be with her , &quot; Mark@@ os@@ ki added .
I saw them together and they have the right chemistry .
they feel comfortable and comfortable with each other .
Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay believes she and Sam Wood are well suited as a couple .
from her point of view M@@ ack@@ ay said that the house visit last week made her clear that Wood was &quot; one . &quot;
&quot; as soon as I saw him with my friends and family , it became clear to me that this was obviously not just a game - I am now un@@ reserv@@ edly adjusted to him , &quot; she said .
and when she was asked whom Wood had to choose , if not she , she was en@@ ig@@ matic .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know if I can say it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I love the remaining girls equally - it &apos;s a tie between S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana and L@@ ana .
the Bachelor is broadcast on Wednesday , 19 : 30 , on Ten .
originally published as Sarah &apos;s first choice for Sam Wood ?
Jar@@ ry@@ d Hay@@ ne had several options to start his N@@ FL career .
Detroit and Seattle showed great interest after moving to the USA - and there were many other teams who sent requests after his impressive open training day at the end of last year .
but Hay@@ ne chose the San Francisco 49@@ ers and Trainer Jim Tom@@ sul@@ a and it looks like a wise decision .
some trainers would have banned Hay@@ ne for the rest of the game , when he lost a match as the Aus@@ sie Ru@@ g@@ by League converter did on Tuesday at 20 @-@ 3 victory against Minn@@ es@@ ota on Tuesday .
but Tom@@ sul@@ a trusted his husband and gave Hay@@ ne the next opportunity for a punch @-@ return and also in the running game after a violation of Reg@@ gie Bush .
Tom@@ sul@@ a continued to show his true face in the locker room after the game .
instead of grinding his ro@@ ok@@ ies before the rest of the team , he encouraged them .
Tom@@ sul@@ a also publi@@ ci@@ zed Hay@@ ne in his press conference after the game .
the 49@@ ers Spor@@ tre@@ por@@ ter Cam In@@ man reported that Hay@@ ne was also encouraged by special team coordinator Thomas Mc@@ Gau@@ gh@@ ey who advised him to forget his scrat@@ ched catch and take care of the next game .
Jar@@ ry@@ d Hay@@ ne p@@ atz@@ t with a pun@@ t restored in the first quarter of Minn@@ es@@ ota Vi@@ kings
it was certainly not the start that Hay@@ ne and his massive Australian followers were hoping for his N@@ FL debut .
Hay@@ ne left the play@@ field after the f@@ um@@ ble and later told the Australian Radio Duo Ham@@ ish &amp; Andy on 2@@ Day@@ FM 10@@ 4.1 that he couldn &apos;t imagine a worse start into his N@@ FL career ,
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was a thing that happens now , you just take care of the next game , and that &apos;s it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hay@@ ne said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Hay@@ ne compared the Schn@@ itzer with his Orig@@ in debut back then in 2007 when a passport at his own in @-@ Go@@ al area led to a T@@ ry for Que@@ ens@@ land .
overall , it was a great experience for the 27 @-@ year @-@ old .

free voters demand the hi@@ ring of 1000 new teachers in Bavaria because of the high number of refugees .
party and group leader Hubert Ai@@ wan@@ ger warned about a serious crisis in Bavaria &apos;s schools at the beginning of the F@@ W @-@ Aut@@ umn Conference in Groß@@ wo@@ stadt , when there are not correspon@@ dingly new teachers for the many new students : &quot; we need at least 1000 additional teachers to keep the schools from collapse , &quot; said Ai@@ wan@@ ger .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; otherwise we will get classi@@ fications in the Bavarian education system . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Friday voters &apos; auction takes place until Friday in the Fran@@ con@@ ian municipality .
in fact , quite different main themes were planned .
but the record number of refugees is now dominated by Free voters .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course , the topic of asylum will over@@ lap the clo@@ ister , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ai@@ wan@@ ger . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ai@@ wan@@ ger called for the establishment of UN protection zones for refugees in Syria , as did it during the Yugosla@@ v War in the n@@ ine@@ ties .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not the case , we have to address the causes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Free voters boss . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
rejected asylum seek@@ ers want to push the Free voters away as soon as possible .
for this reason , Ai@@ wan@@ ger also demanded more staff for the administration courts responsible for asylum complaints : &quot; we also need at least 50 new asylum seek@@ ers , &quot; said Ai@@ wan@@ ger .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the F@@ W boss critic@@ ised the fact that several federal states are not consistent : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need uniform federal standards across Germany . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; Bavaria is pushing off , others don &apos;t . &quot;
&quot; we need to become more effective . &quot;
but the state policy in Groß@@ Wall@@ stadt should not fall under the table .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a lon@@ gla@@ sting long @-@ term torch remains on the agenda : education policy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for the new school year , cult minister Ludwig Spa@@ en@@ le ( CS@@ U ) started the pilot study &quot; Middle @-@ level plus , &quot; where an extension of the three @-@ year secondary school is being tested for four years .

fir@@ mer Wall Street helps D@@ ax to jump
the German stock market closed with profits after a long @-@ distance and annoying tra@@ j@@ ec@@ tory .
only in the afternoon was a strong start to the US stock markets for a clear direction , which ultimately promoted the D@@ ax by 0.@@ 56 percent to 10 18@@ 8.@@ 13 points .
the M@@ DA@@ X medium @-@ sized values gained 0.@@ 54 percent to 19 55@@ 2,@@ 88 points .
the technology @-@ resistant Tec@@ D@@ ax climbed by 1.@@ 03 percent to 17@@ 3@@ 6.@@ 69 points .
the Euro@@ Sto@@ xx 50 as the leading index in the Eurozone fell by 1.@@ 01 percent to 3@@ 20@@ 7.@@ 60 points .
solid profits also earned premi@@ ums in London and Paris .
in the US , the D@@ ow Jones Index ranked around 1 percent in Plus last year .
many stock markets expect markets to be replaced on this Friday right up to the interest rate decision in the US and also to the large decline on the fut@@ ures markets .
the discussion about the loads from nuclear ph@@ asing has meanwhile pushed the shares of RW@@ E to a record low and also left deep traces on E@@ on .
according to &quot; Spiegel , &quot; German energy corporations may be lacking 30 billion euros .
the Federal Government has denied the figures stated in the press .
as a result , the shares of the two largest German energy companies recovered slightly , but ultimately always lost 3.3 percent ( RW@@ E ) and 6.@@ 15 percent ( E@@ on ) .
Infin@@ eon shares grew by a further 3.3 percent at the D@@ ax summit .
according to a dealer , a positive report from the US investor magazine &quot; Bar@@ ron &apos;s &quot; produced a positive report from the weekend .
accordingly , investors were given little attention to the German chip maker .
the investment in promising wafer technologies and the focus on the car market should be paid .
car values were in demand : even in August , even in the traditionally weak summer month , more cars were sold than in the same period last year , as the AC@@ EA industry association announced the launch of the International Motor Show IAA in Frankfurt .
the papers from the Daimler and BMW car manufacturers increased by 1.@@ 34 percent and 2.@@ 21 percent respectively .
Volkswagen virtu@@ es increased by 1.@@ 26 percent .
on the German pension market , the return return on listed federal securities fell to 0.@@ 48 ( Friday : 0.@@ 50 ) percent .
the pension index Re@@ x rose by 0.@@ 12 percent to 13@@ 9,@@ 55 points .
the Con@@ federation Future lost 0.@@ 71 percent to 15@@ 4.@@ 11 points .
the euro &apos;s course sank in the afternoon to 1.@@ 12@@ 62 dollars .
at mid@@ day , the European Central Bank had set the reference rate to 1.@@ 13@@ 05 ( 1.@@ 12@@ 68 ) US dollars .
this means that the dollar cost 0.@@ 88@@ 46 ( 0.@@ 88@@ 75 ) Euro .
4 people killed after police fired rubber bul@@ lets on demonstr@@ ators in Nepal
four people , including a 4 @-@ year @-@ old boy , were killed in southern Nepal after the police fired rubber bul@@ lets into a crowd that demonstrated against the proposed new constitution , a civil servant said on Wednesday .
the violence broke out on Tuesday evening in the district of Rup@@ an@@ stret@@ i , about 175 miles west of the capital Kath@@ mand@@ u .
B@@ ish@@ n@@ u Pr@@ as@@ ad D@@ ha@@ kal , Chief Executive Officer , said that more than 1,000 demonstr@@ ators had gathered outside a police station , throwing stones and incen@@ diary bombs on them .
Mr D@@ ha@@ kal said the police used tear gas and then shot in the air before they res@@ or@@ ted to rubber bul@@ lets .
20 polic@@ emen and five civilians were injured , he said .
it was not immediately clear why the rubber bul@@ lets , which are known to be able to kill , which are traditionally used as a less le@@ thal alternative , obviously produced such a high death rate .
the debate was the last in weeks of violent protests in Nepal &apos;s southern plains , where members of the Mad@@ rec@@ i ethnic group say that new provinces , formed under the proposed new constitution , would reduce their political influence .
there were also protests in the western Nepal by the ethnic group of the Th@@ arus who want to have their own state .
at least 40 people , including 11 police officers , were in violent confron@@ tations since the 10th .
August killed when the four major political parties signed an agreement to divide the country into provinces - an important step towards a new constitution , but a very controversial subject in Nepal , which has been ruled over for centuries .
working on a new constitution has been on its way since 2008 , but the law@@ makers ha@@ st@@ ened the process after the devastating earthquake that killed thousands of people in April .
the legis@@ lators have voted this week on certain cl@@ auses in the draft constitution in Kath@@ mand@@ u , and officials have said that the new constitution could enter into force on Sunday .
construction area planned in the city
the plot at the Em@@ den Youth Centre Alte Post is to be restored .
the city is currently preparing everything for the marketing of the 4000 m2 area .
a mixture of trade , commerce and housing is planned - but there are no concrete proposals yet .
Em@@ den - The city of Em@@ den wants to market an approximately 4000 square metre plot in direct proximity to the Youth Centre Alte Post .
the preparations for this are currently underway .
the plan is to use the site for a mix of trade , commerce and housing .
one is waiting for appropriate offers , is it on the part of the city .
no matter which investor comes into question is not yet clear .
accordingly , no contracts were concluded .
the city of Em@@ den had bought a part of the property , which is located at the ring road / corner big street , bought already a few months ago and let the building be torn down .
project H@@ ieve : details are on the table
the plans for the holiday resort on the Small Sea near Em@@ den take shape .
for the first time , the investor made public plans for the project .
several trailers are still worried - they fear the sale of their leisure vehicle
for months , behind closed doors was negotiated , practiced , deb@@ ated and drawn .
the plans for a new holiday in the Small Sea near Em@@ den are now on the table .
the interest , the medium @-@ sized Em@@ den company &quot; System @-@ Bau , &quot; presented his plans for the first time in the city development committee of the Em@@ den Council on Monday evening .
originally , this point had been on the non @-@ public part of the agenda .
under pressure from the project critics and the F@@ DP faction , which accused the investors and the administration of sec@@ rec@@ y , Ralf Be@@ hr@@ ends went off from the system construction management to the offensive : &quot; we have not yet answered all questions , &quot; he said before the Council members and more than 50 visitors .
but it is good to be able to meet all the rum@@ ors now .
the project has been in discussion for months with approximately ten to twelve million euros .
violent reactions under sea @-@ bu@@ ster owners who had come to the meeting cried out the pictures and new details of the desired hotel building .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Roberto Schulz said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a giant cl@@ ot@@ z that domin@@ ates all the other buildings . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , he fears like a number of other project critics that the traffic would greatly increase due to the intended size of the system : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there must be whole bus loads so that it pays off , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Schulz &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , what exactly is happening on the well one hectare site of the former restaurant is still open .
there is no operator yet .
&quot; first we must have a coherent concept , &quot; said Ralf Be@@ hr@@ inger .

Google launches dou@@ bling donation campaign to collect 11 million $ for refugees
Google Inc ( Goo@@ gl . O ) announced a dou@@ bling donation campaign to raise $ 11 million for humanitarian organizations that will help thousands of refugees fle@@ eing the European nations as they flee from war torn and im@@ pover@@ ished countries .
Google has an un@@ usually personal approach to announc@@ ing the Don@@ ations call on his blog .
instead of giving a manager the announcement , Rita Mas@@ oud , a Google employee , who fled with her family from Kab@@ ul , when she was seven years old , wrote about her personal experiences .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our journey included many dark rail and bus journeys , as well as hunger , thirst , cold and fear , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I was lucky .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but since the refugee and migrant crisis has grown in Europe , many people like my family are desper@@ ately looking for help . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the donations go to four non @-@ profit organizations that provide assistance to refugees and migrants : doctors without borders , International Res@@ cue Committee , Save the Children and UN High Commissioner for Refu@@ ge@@ es .
Google said that the first globally collected donations up to a value of 5.5 million on goo@@ gle@@ .com / could be doubled to $ 11 million .
Europe is being confronted with its worst refugee crisis since the Second World War , largely caused by the four @-@ year civil war in Syria , which has driven more than 4 million people this year .
many also escaped from the war destroyed by war , Yemen , Iraq and Libya .

for slightly overweight diab@@ e@@ tics , weight loss surgery may be helpful .
the advantages of weight loss surgery for obes@@ e overweight people with type 2 diabetes can last for at least five years after a new study .
it is still too early to tell if slightly overweight people with diabetes after weight loss surgery live longer than those who do not receive surgical treatments .
&quot; the mortality data need a long time to show something , &quot; said Dr. Robin Black@@ stone , an expert in weight loss surgery , who wrote an editorial to the new study in J@@ AM@@ A Surgery .
weight loss surgery or obesity surgery , use different methods to reduce the size of the stomach .
they reduce hunger and limit the body &apos;s ability to absorb food .
over the years , obesity surgery has proven to be efficient for the treatment of type 2 diabetes , but most studies have been carried out in people who are obes@@ e with a body mass index ( BM@@ I ) of 35 or higher .
BM@@ I , a certain amount of weight in terms of size , is considered normal between 18.@@ 5 and 24.@@ 9 .
a BM@@ I of 25 or more indicates that someone is overweight , and people with a BM@@ I above 30 are considered obes@@ e .
you can calculate your BM@@ I here : 1.@@ us@@ a.@@ go@@ v / 1@@ D@@ 0@@ Z@@ q@@ D@@ v .
for the new study , the researchers from Tai@@ w@@ ans Min @-@ Sh@@ eng General Hospital used data that they have collected in a study since 2007 and compare two types of obesity surgery - ga@@ stri@@ c b@@ ypass and ga@@ stri@@ c catar@@ act - to medical treatments for type 2 diabetes in people who were slightly overweight .
the average BM@@ I among those undergoing this operation decreased from 31 to 24.@@ 5 to the end of the fifth year in this study .
meanwhile , the BM@@ I remained with those who received non @-@ surgical diabetes treatments approximately at 29 .
among those undergoing a surgical procedure , 36 % of the diabetes was totally un@@ resolved and at 28 % in part .
in the medical @-@ treated group , diabetes was completely dissolved in only one percent and in some cases only about two percent .
in addition , the results of the controls of blood pressure , tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ des and &quot; bad &quot; LD@@ L cholesterol were generally better in the &apos; surgical &apos; group , the authors found out .
the researchers also monitored hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c blood glucose levels reflecting the blood sugar levels over time .
ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c is best kept below 7 percent , write the researchers .
after surgery , the average ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c decreased from around 9 percent to around 6 percent .
however , the medical therapy group remained stable at around 8 percent .
but this better &quot; gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic control &quot; - as it is reflected in the improved hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c level - did not reduce mortality in five years , so the guiding researcher Dr. Chi@@ h @-@ Ch@@ eng H@@ su and his colleagues .
the research team also compared the average results for the two types of surgery .
in the fifth year , the b@@ ypass surgery group lost more weight compared to the guest rec@@ tomy group ( 18.@@ 7 vs. 14.@@ 2 kg ) , reaching greater rec@@ esses in BM@@ I ( 7.@@ 4 vs. 5.1 ) and hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c ( 3.1 % vs. 2.1 % ) and referred to a complete overcoming of the diabetes ( 4@@ 6.@@ 9 % vs. 16.@@ 7 % ) .
while the new study shows no survival benefit of the surgery after five years , there are evidence from a study of heavier people in Sweden that surgery leads to a longer life , says Black@@ stone from the University of Arizona , College of Medicine Phoenix .
in the Swedish study , it was in obes@@ e people who underwent obesity surgery , about 29 percent less likely to die over the course of 15 years - compared to a group that tried more conventional methods .
although the new study showed no advantage for survival in the surgery patient , Black@@ stone said it was cal@@ ming for people with a BM@@ I of 35 who are interested in the procedure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the critical point of this study because it says that this operation is lower in this lower BM@@ I group , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; without increased risk of death or kidney disease , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Black@@ stone added that people and their doctors should start taking weight seriously as soon as the patient lies with his BM@@ I between 27 and 30 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think we wait too long for people to take this seriously , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think that once they have accumulated these genetic changes that have firmly connected their body with obesity and diabetes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a revers@@ al is really difficult . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
love story plays in the Hun@@ sr@@ ück
it is a theme that is currently increasingly respected in fiction : a young woman , un@@ popular and un@@ si@@ gh@@ tly , meets the flock of her youth after years , and she falls in love with her .
so even in the recent novel &quot; Ac@@ tually , we are not so &quot; by Lu@@ isa Bin@@ der .
beyond the love story , the novel should be interesting especially for Hun@@ sr@@ ück readers , because he plays in Lang@@ weiler and the surrounding villages .

&quot; it &apos;s impossible that everyone can come to Europe &quot; - Dalai Lama - RT @-@ News
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Europe cannot accept all refugees , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Dalai Lama said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the real solution to the refugee crisis in the Middle East . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Tibetan Buddhist guide urged to stop violence in the hom@@ el@@ ands of refugees .
the Dalai Lama addressed the problem of the ongoing refugee crisis at the beginning of his ten @-@ day visit to the United Kingdom in his speech on the occasion of the opening of the Dalai Lama Centre for Com@@ passion in Oxford , which dedic@@ ates himself to ethics studies .
he demanded that under the given circumstances the interests of humanity should be placed before the interests of the individual nations or even continents .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he also stressed that the reaction of the West European countries to the refugee crisis is ad@@ mira@@ ble , but the situation is not appropriate . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is impossible that everyone can come to Europe , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in his speech . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
even though the Dalai Lama praised Germany and Austria &apos;s efforts to cope with the crisis , he stressed that it was only a temporary solution .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to take care of several thousand refugees is wonderful , but in the meantime , you need to think about long @-@ term solutions , such as true peace and genuine development , mainly through education , for these Muslim countries . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the end , we need to think about how the killing in their countries is reduced . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we must reduce the use of violence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the use of violence has never solved these problems , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he added . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Dalai Lama spoke the problem of violence and also commented George Bush &apos;s action after the terrorist attack of September 11 and found out that the violent reaction of the US moved a chain of un@@ controll@@ able events .
after September 11 , I expressed my con@@ dol@@ ences in a letter to President Bush , and I told him the way to solve this problem lies in non @-@ violence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I know his motives were good , but he put violence and that caused unexpected consequences , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Dalai Lama . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
four@@ fold increase of ing@@ es@@ tion of hand disinf@@ ect@@ ants by children in the last 4 years
poison control centres in the US report about an almost 400 percent increase in the number of children under 12 years , who swal@@ low strong alcoholic hand des@@ infection products , such as Georgia &apos;s Po@@ ison Centre .
according to Dr. Gay@@ lord Lop@@ ez , Director of Georgia &apos;s Po@@ ison Center , the cases of revenue of hand des@@ infection products in children under 12 years of age reported the poison control centres , from 3,@@ 26@@ 6 in 2010 to 16,@@ 117 in 2014 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; children are increasingly coming to these products , and unfortunately a percentage of them land in the emergency room , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Lop@@ ez CN@@ N . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he said that some children pur@@ pos@@ ely drink disinf@@ ect@@ ants while some do it to impress their friends or because of a mut@@ ation among the social media .
YouTube videos show how young@@ sters drink disinf@@ ect@@ ants only because of a cheap experience .
adolescents are said to have mixed disinf@@ ect@@ ants with soft mou@@ th@@ wash to obtain a harder drink .
younger children can be attracted by attractive sc@@ ents of disinf@@ ect@@ ants .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a child does not think that this is bad for it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Lop@@ ez said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
many of the most attractive ( hand @-@ disinf@@ ect@@ ants ) are those that are perf@@ um@@ ed .
there are disinf@@ ect@@ ants with straw@@ berry , grapes and orange scent that are very appealing to children .
hand disinf@@ ect@@ ants contain between 45 and 95 percent alcohol .
especially in infants , a few sp@@ lashes can lead to alcohol pois@@ oning .
&quot; it is highly concentrated alcohol , &quot; said Dr. Stephen Thor@@ n@@ ton , Medical Director of the poison emergency centre at the hospital of the University of K@@ ans@@ as , the Fox 4 station in K@@ ansa City .
so , you wouldn &apos;t leave a si@@ p whis@@ ky around , but people leave this hand @-@ disinf@@ ect@@ ant in reach of children , and when children come to it , then it is a quick way to consume lots of alcohol .
N@@ ha@@ i@@ jah Rus@@ sell , a six @-@ year @-@ old girl who recently took four sp@@ lashes of after straw@@ berry fra@@ grant drugs in the school , was brought to an emergency room for treatment .
her blood alcohol concentration was 17@@ 9 , twice higher than the threshold that has been illegal in an adult , said Dr. Chris Rit@@ ch@@ ey , an emergency medical doctor who treated them in the W@@ inn@@ ett Medical Center outside Atlanta .
N@@ ha@@ i@@ jah l@@ all@@ ready her words and was unable to go when she arrived in the emergency room .
doctors monitored them overnight in a separate children &apos;s hospital for signs of brain trauma , as the girl had fallen through the alcohol and had pushed his head , Rit@@ ch@@ ey said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was very frigh@@ tening , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Or@@ tori@@ a Scott , N@@ ha@@ i@@ j@@ ahs &apos;s mother , CN@@ N . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it could have been fatal for my child .
Lop@@ ez has recommended parents and teachers to use alcohol @-@ free products or disinf@@ ect@@ ants and store hand disinf@@ ect@@ ants outside the reach of the child .
beyond alcohol intoxic@@ ation , some disinf@@ ect@@ ants were associated with deaths .
in 2013 , two women in Ontario died after swal@@ lowing hand disinf@@ ect@@ ants which contained a toxic , non @-@ declared ingredient .
health authorities suspect that the product contained meth@@ anol , a deadly solution instead of eth@@ yl alcohol , which was noted as an active ingredient .
in January three students of the fourth class in New York were planning to poison their &quot; common &quot; teacher by putting anti@@ bacterial products around the classroom , &quot; reports a police report .
the teacher is highly allergic to hand disinf@@ ect@@ ants and ban@@ ished them from their room .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the police regarded the en@@ acted plan as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; g@@ ossi@@ p &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and referred to disciplinary action to the school authority . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

lack of title competition in Scottish football is boring Dutch - de Bo@@ er
the former R@@ angers @-@ mid@@ fiel@@ der and former national player of the Netherlands Ron@@ ald de Bo@@ er said that Dutch football fans have lost interest in Cel@@ tic , there is no title ri@@ val@@ ry with the R@@ angers .
de Bo@@ er , currently an ambassador for Aj@@ ax , said : &quot; in Holland they show no highlights of the Cel@@ tic games more and why ? &quot;
it is because the R@@ angers are not there .
people here talk not only about the return of the R@@ angers .
they talk about the Old Fir@@ m .
they talk about both teams and this is what interests them .
there is a lot of excitement in the Old @-@ Fir@@ m games , and it &apos;s not just the people in Scotland who want to see these games .
I will turn things around , swe@@ ars Dei@@ la .
Ron@@ ny Dei@@ la has accepted Cel@@ tic has to fight but the Norwegian chef s@@ wore to turn things around .
after the defeat against Malm@@ ö and the subsequent retirement from the Champions League , the defeat against 10 men from Aber@@ deen , which now with five points lead is clearly at the top of the table .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but Dei@@ la said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Cel@@ tic had bad times before and we will come back . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
now we want to get out as soon as possible .
I know it &apos;s very frustr@@ ating and a lot of people are very , very angry or sad about what happens .
we feel that exactly this way - but we have to go on .
we really need really the support of Cel@@ tic because that makes the players better .
standing together is so important .
War@@ bur@@ ton carefully in January transfers

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the ex @-@ boss of Br@@ ent@@ ford said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the January Transfer window is very different from the summer window . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the players coming in the summer have this pre @-@ season time to integrate what you have seen with our own group during this season .
the team is really good .
sometimes more damage is done by adding unnecessary players to what you really need .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mc@@ Inn@@ es said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; There is no team that has won everything , in poker games or le@@ agues , the games of this kind also won &apos;t win . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
unemployment in Scotland remains unchanged , while it rises in the United Kingdom overall .
unemployment in Scotland remained unchanged from May to July at 16@@ 4,000 , while the number of people without work for the UK as a whole rose by 10,000 to 1.@@ 82 million in the same period .
Scotland &apos;s unemployment rate of 5.@@ 9 percent was over the level of the U@@ K@@ s of 5.5 percent , as the figures of the Bureau for National Statistics ( ON@@ S ) showed .
in the meantime , employment in Scotland fell by 12@@ ,000 during the three months , with the number of employees now at 2,@@ 6@@ 12@@ ,000 .
in the course of the quarter the employment rate for Scotland fell to 7@@ 4.0 percent - a figure on the UK average of 7@@ 3.5 percent .
the Secretary of State for Scotland David Mund@@ ell commented on the latest figures and said : &quot; the long @-@ term plan of the government laid the foundation for a stronger economy . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is almost exactly one year since Scotland has made the historic decision to remain part of the UK . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in these 12 months we have experienced further improvements in the Scottish labour market with an increase in employment and a decline in unemployment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

why I &apos;m witness@@ ing an execution in O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma
a little later , except for a late legal action , I will see how a man is put to death .
if it happens , and I hope it doesn &apos;t happen , I will sit in an audience gallery in the death chamber at O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma State Pen@@ it@@ enti@@ ary when Richard G@@ los@@ si@@ p is executed by the poison inj@@ ector .
he asked me to be one of the four official witnesses at his death .
the invitation was already made for the first time in January about his best friend , and although I was shocked , I agreed .
when the day drew near , I began to fear .
so , why should I do it ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I agreed , because I thought it would be a good way to tell the story about the death penalty . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it would offer a unique perspective .
it is true that journalists are allowed to see exec@@ utions in the US , and as often more applications are available as places , a mac@@ ab@@ re lot@@ tery takes place in order to decide who is elected .
O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma has reduced the number of media slots from 12 to five .
whoever is chosen will see it emotion@@ less .
I can &apos;t .
I will sit next to Richard G@@ los@@ si@@ ps closest friend with whom I have developed my own relationship over the months with telephone calls and a two and a half hours visit .
I like the guy .
we often laugh a lot when we speak .
the prison authorities say that I cannot be a witness and a journalist , so it will not be allowed me to take a not@@ ebook and a pen to record what I see .
I just have to try to remember all the details .
a journalist from O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma acc@@ uses me of Twitter to give up my im@@ parti@@ ality .
here is the lesson .
tell the story of the prisoner as he wants and you get access .
I have compl@@ ained to her .
she admitted that she &quot; could have better formulated it , &quot; but she still thinks it &apos;s wrong what I do .
Richard G@@ los@@ si@@ p had problem with some of the things I said and wrote .
he doesn &apos;t tell me what I have to write , and I wouldn &apos;t do it even if he would do it .
I told him that he can remove me from his list of witnesses at any time .
but he wants an international repor@@ ter to be present to write there .
when he dies , he thinks that public relations will help the movement against the death penalty .
Kim Bell@@ ware , a repor@@ ter of Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post , will sit next to me .
if you want to know more about the case , please listen to the series of pod@@ casts I &apos;ve made .
I don &apos;t want to go back to all details here .
I can &apos;t say that Richard G@@ los@@ si@@ p is innocent .
his actions after the assass@@ ination of Barry Van Tre@@ ese would make him guilty of being a bene@@ fici@@ ary of the act .
but I believe that a strong lik@@ el@@ ihood is that he is not guilty of murder .
I believe that there is not enough evidence to justify a death sentence .
I believe his execution is wrong .
and from this perspective I will see him dying .
I can &apos;t claim to be really objective .
there will be other repor@@ ters that you can turn to .
what you will get from me is what it means to see a man die an unnecessary death .
man after damp police ch@@ ase persu@@ aded to come out of the C@@ anning River
the C@@ anning V@@ ale polic@@ eman was dry when he persu@@ aded the man from the C@@ anning River .
an attempt by a man of Per@@ th to hang out the police was un@@ successful when he was in the shallow and sw@@ amp@@ y water , just a few meters away from a police officer trying to &quot; gently persu@@ ade him to return to the shore . &quot;
the C@@ anning V@@ ale police were called on Tuesday to a house peace raid in pel@@ vic area .
when they discovered the susp@@ ects , he tried to escape them towards the C@@ anning River .
but he did not come too far .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he stood in the water and said &apos; I &apos;m not coming out , come and get me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said senior ser@@ ge@@ ant S@@ hand@@ ell Cast@@ led@@ ine . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Con@@ stable Lach@@ lan Per@@ ha@@ ve@@ c was not too enthusiastic about making his uniform wet , so he applied a more reliable tac@@ tic - &quot; A good polic@@ eman . &quot;
&quot; sometimes people do funny things to try to escape , &quot; said senior ser@@ ge@@ ant Cast@@ led@@ ine .
Championship football player Ben C@@ ous@@ ins offers an unforgettable example .
in 2006 , cous@@ ins drove his car to the dit@@ ch to avoid alcohol control and then tried to swim over the S@@ wan River .
his efforts were un@@ successful but inspired natives to the humor@@ ous planning of a Ben C@@ ous@@ in @-@ Bi@@ athlon .
Peter M@@ oo@@ dy claims that ste@@ wards tried to spy on him and threat@@ ens to end racing
Peter M@@ oo@@ dy claims that ste@@ wards from Racing Victoria tried to install a spy on his st@@ ables last year and threatened to finish the race immediately .
he aimed at ste@@ wards and the integrity department of Racing Victoria and claimed that she had a personal campaign against him with the L@@ ate S@@ cr@@ at@@ ching of Lady Tat@@ ai for a race day treatment , the last straw on Wednesday .
M@@ oo@@ dy said Fair@@ fax Media that he always tried to do what is best for racing and he found himself under difficult conditions when it came to the positive cob@@ alt tone test at Li@@ dar@@ i , which he cannot explain .
he had with@@ held 18 months for the es@@ pion@@ age charges and did not want it to &quot; look like too high @-@ hanging grapes . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I had nothing to say about it and I sat on it for a long time , but sometimes you are so frustr@@ ated that everything comes out once , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said M@@ oo@@ dy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they know that it continued .
sometimes you react , and you have to live with the consequences , and I have to live with what I have said .
tonight I will go home and sleep well .
I want to walk the head raised and I want my owners to think that I try my best for them .
if they start thinking , I don &apos;t do that , then I shouldn &apos;t be a coach .
I have to think about what I do with my license .
prior to that , M@@ oo@@ dy had raised the bomb in an interview with rac@@ ing.com that the integrity department had tried to spy on his stall .
&quot; eigh@@ teen months ago Ter@@ ry B@@ ail@@ ey , Day@@ le Brown and Dr. Brian Ste@@ wart were sitting in a room with a man - whom I will name when asked - and offered him a job in my st@@ ables to provide information about what I am doing within my st@@ ables , &quot; said M@@ oo@@ dy on rac@@ ing.com .
they apparently believe that I am a dec@@ eiver .
if this is the case , they should surely believe in their n@@ oses , because they failed in trying to touch me .
Robert Rou@@ l@@ ston , former Chairman of the R@@ V@@ L , David M@@ oo@@ die , reig@@ ning president of the R@@ V@@ L and Bernard Sa@@ undry , current CEO of the R@@ V@@ L , were aware of this at the time and are still today .
should I think that it will be personal ?
does the R@@ V@@ L have a cow@@ ard@@ ly behaviour and perhaps makes people outside trainers responsible for what is going on in the industry ?
am I bad for the industry ?
am I so bad for the industry ?
maybe people think outside that I am .
maybe they have to take my license and reject me , and I have no doubt that what I say they can now think about it .
but I am now at the point where it doesn &apos;t matter , and that makes me sad .
that makes me really sad .
I will ex@@ ert pressure on them and push them to make a decision .
I have the support of my family and I can go .
the training levels of the trainer started with the long lasting cob@@ alt examination at Li@@ dar@@ i , and L@@ ate S@@ cr@@ at@@ ching meant that he could &quot; throw his license above the table . &quot;
M@@ oo@@ dy , best known by his preparation for the un@@ defeated Master Black C@@ avi@@ ar , described the Sunday treatment rule &quot; ridi@@ culous &quot; after a package of mud or clay was applied to the horse &apos;s debate , which viol@@ ated the rules .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is against the rules of racing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have to take full responsibility for it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; one of my collabor@@ ators mistakenly put mud on the leg .
it could have been so last night .
it could have been the whole day yesterday , which was so .
but it was also so on the race day .
M@@ oo@@ dy could be confronted with a three month dis@@ qualification for the treatment with the package on the race day . an investigation of this issue was opened .
it is a joke .
people who set up these rules do not know anything about the horse .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we all see that we need rules , but here you have gone too far , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said M@@ oo@@ dy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
man arrested after driver flight
on the weekend , the police arrested a man after a collision with a cycli@@ st and subsequent driver flight in Cob@@ urg .
the cycli@@ st was delivered with the helicopter to the Royal Melbourne Hospital with severe injuries after being hit by a car on Saturday morning at the Mur@@ ray @-@ Valley highway .

Melbourne @-@ Storm @-@ Trainer Cra@@ ig Bell@@ amy fights against ri@@ vals for claims on ring fighting
Melbourne @-@ Storm @-@ Trainer Cra@@ ig Bell@@ amy has critic@@ ised the Tac@@ kl@@ ing of his players as &quot; Agenda Set@@ ting &quot; of two Premier League favorites of the N@@ R@@ L .
Sydney R@@ oo@@ ster Trainer Tr@@ ent Robinson said that the refer@@ ees allowed the Storm @-@ players &quot; ring @-@ fights &quot; with his team during the high Storm victory in the qualifying finale in Sydney on Friday evening .
Bris@@ ban@@ e Bron@@ co Trainer Way@@ ne B@@ enn@@ ett did a hard @-@ disgu@@ ised note to the Storm team after his team achieved the final victory against North Que@@ ens@@ land Cow@@ boys on Saturday night . he called the game a &quot; sample example &quot; of the Ru@@ g@@ by League and said that the two from Que@@ ens@@ land were not too good &quot; in the rings .
Bell@@ amy defended the tac@@ it of his team and said that they were only focused on their &quot; contact &quot; at the Tac@@ kl@@ ing .
Bell@@ amy added that the cri@@ tiques of two leading trainers on his team are confident that they were worried that they were worried about being beaten by the Storm team .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this time and again - I have not heard that Tr@@ ent Robinson spoke about ring battles when they hit us 24 : 2 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bell@@ amy on Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I can guarantee that we have changed nothing in our defensive system or techniques throughout the year . but over the past six weeks , we have made our contact with Tac@@ kl@@ es a real focus , and this has brought the turn@@ around for us .
Tr@@ ent has been there for three years and he obviously has a great team to train . therefore he is probably not accustomed to losing , so it was a bit of a shock for him .
it is funny how this occurs again and again at this time of the year .
Bell@@ amy has attacked B@@ enn@@ etts &apos;s idea of &quot; exciting football &quot; and reminds his ment@@ or that B@@ enn@@ etts St George Il@@ la@@ war@@ ra Dra@@ gons won the Premier League in 2010 with &quot; boring &quot; football .
Way@@ ne speaks of exciting football .
he compared his game on Saturday evening with our Friday night and how exciting her game was , &quot; said Bell@@ amy .
I remember that in 2010 St George was critici@@ zed as a boring team , and Way@@ ne said he will take care of a divor@@ ce .
but now he has a team that can play and watch as exciting , especially his young players with their speed .
this is the ball game you want to play when you have this kind of players .
he made this statement in 2010 , now he wants all his kind of football to play - not every team has two players like Anthony Mil@@ ford and Ben Hun@@ t , so they can play like this .
I build stronger confidence because they say these things because they are a bit worried to play against us .
six weeks ago they didn &apos;t think of us when it came to the big games .
Bell@@ amy also pointed out that the game Storm versus R@@ oo@@ sters achieved a higher result than the game Bron@@ co vs. Cow@@ boys .
the game of the Bron@@ co was probably a good game , I haven &apos;t seen it yet , but what was the result ? 16 : 12 ?
our game was 20 : 18 , there were two more trials in our game , but is that an exciting game ?
or are breaks made and no points any tension ?
for me it is the game boards .
when they talk to us , it means that we will meet on them in a single phase .
the Storm team has released this weekend as they have won the right to receive either North Que@@ ens@@ land Cow@@ boys or the C@@ ron@@ ul@@ la Sh@@ arks on the next Saturday night at the A@@ AM@@ I Park . ticket sales begin next Tuesday morning .
Ser@@ bier with $ 200,000 Guarant@@ ee on Drug Fi@@ ghting
a man who could possibly have a lifel@@ ong punishment because of his attempt to come into possession of 40 kil@@ os of co@@ ca@@ ine , which was s@@ mu@@ g@@ gled to Que@@ ens@@ land , was released against a deposit of $ 200,000 .
Mark@@ o Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c , 29 , was one of the five men who were arrested last month after the Federal Police found 100 kg of the drug on the yacht Sol@@ ay , which came from South America via Van@@ u@@ at@@ u and arrived in Co@@ om@@ era in August .
Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c was watched as he met his co @-@ def@@ end@@ ants in the marina during the morning and later in the Café Co@@ om@@ era Road@@ house where police found 40 kil@@ os of the drug in a Toyota Echo .
despite a potentially life @-@ related penalty for attempting to possess a commercial amount of co@@ ca@@ ine , the lawyer of Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c argued that there was no evidence that he tried to own the whole lot and that in the café could have been a harmless reason .
the judge at the Supreme Court , Peter Flan@@ ag@@ an , was worried about the risk of escape at Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c .
he has clear relations with Serbia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he often travels to Serbia , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he declared the court on Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the case of criminal proceedings , he lied to the police about his where@@ ab@@ outs .
Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ cs &apos;s mother and step@@ father had offered a $ 200,000 security deposit together to get his release .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after reading the declarations of the two persons , it is clear that the circulation of 200,000 dollars represents a real financial burden , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ju@@ dge Flan@@ ag@@ an said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but this alone will not suff@@ ice to prevent him from appearing , he warned .
Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c was released on security deposit under the conditions that he gives his Australian and his Serbian passport , reports to the police every day and stops at a cur@@ few from 18 : 00 @-@ 06 : 00 .
accident at A5 at Karlsruhe : cab torn apart
in case of a collision with three trucks on the motorway 5 near Karlsruhe , a truck driver was seriously injured on Tuesday evening .
two of the three trucks involved had bra@@ ked in front of a permanent construction site in the direction of Basel .
the third driver noted it too late and tried in vain to turn left at the last moment , as the police hur@@ ried .
the driver &apos;s cab of the accident caused the accident completely apart .
the driver was seriously injured in a hospital .
the A5 between Bru@@ chs@@ al and Karlsruhe @-@ Nord was completely closed for six hours until 2 p.m .
there was a damage in the amount of 12@@ 2,000 euros .
St@@ ev@@ an Ho@@ gg used phone of girls to l@@ ure pa@@ ed@@ op@@ hil@@ es to send pictures
a P@@ äd@@ op@@ hil@@ er used the phone of a 11 year old girl to demand pictures of child abuse .
St@@ ev@@ an Ho@@ gg took the girl &apos;s phone when she fell asleep , logged into an online mess@@ aging service from which he received a series of in@@ decent pictures of children sent to him by another user .
the girl later woke up and discovered that the phone was missing and found it in the hand of the sleeping Ho@@ gg .
she saw it , found the conf@@ using news and immediately al@@ armed her mother .
the police took care of it and looked at the five images , then analyzed computers that were found at the address and discovered &quot; appropriate &quot; web searches , which used terms to search for un@@ decent images of children .
he then asser@@ ted that he did it as it would lead to &quot; pa@@ ed@@ op@@ hil@@ es on the Internet , &quot; and he then &quot; pre@@ tended to be a polic@@ eman in order to frigh@@ ten them . &quot;
the prosec@@ utor E@@ ili@@ d@@ h Rober@@ ts@@ on told the Dun@@ dee Sh@@ eri@@ ff Court : &quot; he said it would be a ad@@ diction - that he is addic@@ ted to sc@@ are people .
he admitted that searching on the computer were carried out by him , but said that it was happening because he wanted to be a polic@@ eman to sc@@ are pa@@ ed@@ op@@ hil@@ es .
he was asked about his conversations with the unknown person who sent him the pictures and he asked him to send even more photos .
he said he did it to l@@ ure her .
he said he was sick in the head when he drinks , and said he wanted to see pictures of rape and murder .
MS Rober@@ ts@@ on added : &quot; when the girl found the news on the phone , she called her mother and was on the shaking and crying .
she also saw the un@@ decent images on the phone and confronted the accused with it .
the girl was inter@@ viewed and said that the def@@ end@@ ant used computer and Pla@@ yst@@ ation to talk to girls who looked much younger than he did .
Ho@@ gg , 23 , W@@ ard Road , Dun@@ dee , ple@@ aded guilty to having accepted un@@ decent pictures of children on 14 June last year , on 25 January this year viol@@ ated the conditions and did not appear in court for a hearing on 24 March of this year .
defense attorney Greg@@ or S@@ im asked Ho@@ gg to not appear in the Register of Sex@@ ual Cri@@ min@@ ors , argu@@ ing that &quot; no significant sexual element &quot; could be found in his off@@ ence .
Sh@@ eri@@ ff A@@ list@@ air Car@@ mi@@ ch@@ ael postpon@@ ed the verdict until October to receive background reports on social work .
Ho@@ gg was granted a security deposit in this case but was held in custody pending hearing on other cases pending .
he was added to the list of sexual offen@@ ders before the date of judgment .
slu@@ dges devi@@ ate from small border cross@@ ings to Germany
more and more refugees are taken up from the major control points at the German @-@ Austrian border .
for fear of discovery and arrest , many floo@@ d@@ gates grew more and more at smaller border cross@@ ings .
out of the Austrian side , a spokes@@ man of the Federal Police said .
more than 1000 refugees have been taken up along the river border river Inn in the Land@@ kreise of Passa@@ u and Rot@@ tal @-@ Inn since Tuesday .
they had reached the German side by foot through bridges and dam@@ s .
there they are received by Federal Police officers and forwarded to the registration .
according to federal police data , significantly more refugees once again arrived at Munich Main Station in comparison to the start of the week on Wednesday .
around 700 people arrived in the state capital by 8 : 00 alone , said a spokes@@ man in the morning .
after the re @-@ introduction of controls at the German @-@ Austrian border on Tuesday , 17@@ 59 refugees had reached the city .
Stuttgart : for@@ er@@ un@@ ner of tropical storm &quot; Henry &quot; expected in the south @-@ west
meteor@@ ologists warn against storms in the south @-@ west of Wednesday afternoon .
due to a low pressure area over Western Europe , warm sea air currently flows into the country , distributed the German Weather Service ( DW@@ D ) in Stuttgart .
the powerful low was the for@@ er@@ un@@ ner of the tropical storm &quot; Henry , &quot; which was pulled over the Atlantic in recent days from the Bermuda Islands .
heavy storms and thunder@@ storms are expected in Baden .
according to DW@@ D , even until Thursday , even in the Black Forest , on the Sw@@ ab@@ ian Al@@ b and in the bottom @-@ sea circle with bu@@ cks of 60 to 90 kilometres per hour .
on Friday you can see the sun for a longer time .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the mass makes it : every two years , the car makers show their new products at the IAA . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
2015 is to be seen in the compact cars , which are currently particularly well sold .
cars from the compact class are currently in demand : around 28.@@ 1 percent of new registr@@ ations accounted for this segment alone in August , according to the German Federal Aviation Authority ( KBA ) .
this is reflected at the IAA ( audience days 17 to 27 September ) .
many new compact models will be presented this year between all the futur@@ istic concept cars and new luxury cars and luxury cars .
one of the biggest premi@@ eres for the German car industry is the Opel Astra , which will be at deal@@ er@@ ships in autumn .
&quot; the Astra is an extremely important model for us , &quot; said Opel Group CEO Karl @-@ Thomas Neumann .
it belongs to the core of the brand .
in order for the volume model to be sold well , the new Astra is not to be much more expensive .
Opel puts a start below the biggest competi@@ tor VW Golf in the view that starts at 17,@@ 650 euros .
the current Astra will cost from 16@@ 9@@ 90 euros .
the Astra is equipped with a new 1.4 @-@ liter engine with 74 kW / 100 hp .
in addition , the Hessen also offer other diesel and gasoline engines of 70 kW / 95 hp to 147 kW / / 200 hp , for which three @-@ cylinder gasoline engines are included for the first time .
unlike the most important competi@@ tor VW Golf and Ford Focus , the Opel Astra is only available as a five @-@ door model .
the second variant will follow in the spring of the Com@@ bi , which is also visible at the IAA .
and what will happen next to the Astra at the IAA yet in a new compact car ?
Renault Mé@@ gan@@ e : Renault sends the fourth generation of its Astra competi@@ tor Mé@@ gan@@ e into the race .
at the trade fair , the Mé@@ gan@@ e is only available as a five @-@ door in a conventional sporty GT version .
in the trade he arrives at the beginning of next year , then also as a comb@@ i .
Infin@@ iti : brand new in the segment is Infin@@ iti Q@@ 30 .
the Nissan pilot wants to find its position in the strongly growing segment with the new model .
in doing so , the compact Infin@@ iti with its curved lines fits perfectly into the design line of the brand .
the basic model will get a petrol engine with an output of at least 90 kW / 122 hp .
there is also a diesel with 80 kW / 109 hp or 125 kW / 170 hp .
Su@@ zu@@ ki Bal@@ eno : new in the segment is also the Su@@ zu@@ ki Bal@@ eno , which celebrates its world premiere in Frankfurt .
the model is offered with gasoline engines , including a newly developed 1.0 @-@ liter turbo engine and an output of 82 kW / 111 b@@ hp .
the maximum torque is 170 New@@ ton@@ meters ( Nm ) according to manufacturer &apos;s specifications .
sales launch of the Bal@@ eno in Europe is scheduled for spring 2016 .
Ds 4 : not entirely new but completely renewed is the compact class model DS 4 , which can be seen at the IAA .
on the outside , the designers of the noble Cit@@ ro@@ ë@@ n @-@ Ab@@ leg@@ ger first took hand at the front end : here the radiator grill was re@@ drawn and the changed head@@ lights equipped with LED technology .
the inf@@ otainment system was especially modernis@@ ed in the interior , reducing the number of buttons by a touch screen and integrated Apple Car@@ Play for the first time .
at the IAA in the compact class , there are also a number of re@@ visions and new variants such as the refres@@ hed Mercedes A @-@ Class or the Peugeot 30@@ 8 G@@ TI .
J@@ VA Berlin Te@@ gel : five square meters of cell are un@@ worthy
the Federal Constitutional Court has given an ex @-@ prisoner of the Pen@@ al Pen@@ al Service Te@@ gel , which was housed in a small cell for months .
because of the violation of their human dignity , det@@ ain@@ ees are generally entitled to financial compensation if they are housed in too small cells .
this was decided by the Federal Constitutional Court in a decision published on Wednesday .
the suffer@@ ers , according to the judges , can even hope for money if they were imprisoned a few days in the confined spaces ( A@@ z . : 1 BvR 1@@ 127 / 14 ) .
thus an ex @-@ prisoner with his constitutional complaint was successful in Karlsruhe : he was accommod@@ ated in the Berlin @-@ Te@@ gel prison facility between June and November 2009 in a single cell with around five square meters of floor space ; the toilet was spati@@ ally separated .
after that the man , who , according to his lawyer , was now on a free foot@@ ing , was transferred to a larger cell .
his public liability regime because of the un@@ worthy conditions of detention against the State of Berlin failed .
however , the Constitutional Court raised the judgment of the Court of Justice in Berlin and referred the case back to it again .
they see man &apos;s dignity hurt .
court decision now decides on the amount of compensation
even if for legal reasons only a few days of arrest were decisive for the compensation , a compensation was given , it was said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; otherwise , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a tur@@ mo@@ il of the legal protection of the personality would be to be feared . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Court must now clarify the amount of cash compensation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Constitutional Ju@@ dges have often strengthened the rights of prisoners of punishment in the past . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
thus they only talked to a det@@ ain@@ ee in April because he was locked in a cell in the nude .
according to a decision of 2011 , the multiple allocation of a cell without separate toilet is also un@@ worthy .
in addition , on Wednesday , Karlsruhe also confirmed the Berlin Constitutional Court , who had certified a in@@ decent housing in a parallel case in November 2009 .
the then plain@@ ti@@ ff was lod@@ ged between 15 and 21 hours a day between 15 and 21 hours in a similar cell as in the Car@@ ls@@ bad case .
in recent weeks , the pris@@ ons had come to the head@@ lines because of lack of staff .
det@@ ain@@ ees are therefore always en@@ cir@@ cl@@ ed for 23 hours , aggres@@ si@@ veness rises , even to ra@@ ckets it should have been due to the ten@@ se situation .
according to the Office of Justice , 21 jobs in Te@@ gel are not occupied due to junior lack , 19 should fall away in 2016 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Angela Merkel and the refugee policy : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are creating that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the immigration of refugees is an enormous challenge - the Chancellor is determined to accept it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
what is coming to Germany ?
according to statements by the German Federal Ministry of the Interior , around 800 000 asylum seek@@ ers will come to Germany this year , according to the testimony of Vice Chancellor Sig@@ mar Gabriel ( SPD ) , Germany is even capable of taking up a million refugees .
German Chancellor Angela Merkel ( CD@@ U ) demonstrated determination in view of the unusual challenge : &quot; I say again and again : we can do this and we can do that . &quot;
what is coming to Germany gives the following overview .
according to different predic@@ tions , there are between 350@@ 000 ( estimate of the Federal Ministry of Agriculture ) and 400@@ ,000 ( estimate of the P@@ est@@ el Institute ) apartments annually - and for the next five years .
this is almost twice as much as is now being built ( 250@@ 000 apartments ) .
however , the lack of living space is dramatic , but above all at affordable rental objects : every year , 60@@ 000 to 80@@ 000 social apartments are out of the rental price , and in order to apply these particularly favourable apartments , refugees will also apply .
Federal Minister Barbara Hend@@ ri@@ cks ( SPD ) therefore wants to double the funding , currently 5@@ 18 million to a billion euros .
much too little is from the point of view of the P@@ est@@ el Institute : 80 000 social apartments annually would have to arise and the federal government would have to invest a subsi@@ dy of 6.@@ 4 billion per year .
there is a common agreement between scientists and federal government ministers that there must also be more tax advantages for investments in housing construction .
according to estimates by the Institute for Employment Research , 55 per cent of the refugees in Germany can be employed in the long term .
however , refugees in Germany would not be systematically asked about their qualifications in order to help them get started , says Claudia Walter , project manager for integration and education at the Ber@@ tel@@ smann Foundation .
but for the integration of refugees it is crucial if they find work in Germany .
work is the key to social contacts , for the appreciation in the admission society , but also for the self @-@ este@@ em of the immigrants , says migration researcher Dietrich Thr@@ än@@ hardt .
in Germany , according to the Thr@@ es@@ man , there has been a political change : from the prohibition of employment for refugees to recognise work .
while earlier a ban on employment for asylum seek@@ ers of up to five years ago , this was reduced to three months in November 2014 , just like the residence duty , which restric@@ ts asylum seek@@ ers to a place of residence .
in society , too , because of the shortage of skilled labour , the perspective of refugees is generally en@@ forced that refugees should be able to access the labour market more quickly .
a major hur@@ dle for access to the labour market is a lack of knowledge of German .
so far there is no sufficient offer of general and professional language courses .
studies also show that work@@ places are most often medi@@ ated through personal contacts .
for this reason , the building of networks is , according to the view of Thr@@ es@@ hardt , the royal road to work integration .
the Berlin school administration established that only a few fled parents gave their children to the kit@@ es , estimated ten to 15 percent : &quot; it is only important to keep the family together , &quot; said Il@@ ja Ko@@ esch@@ bar , spokes@@ man for youth and family in the Berlin Senate Administration .
to convince the family nevertheless of the advantages of the K@@ ita , the administration distri@@ butes hand@@ outs in different languages .
if the need for educ@@ ators is increasing due to the large number of refugees , the Senate Senate would try to increase vocational training capacities - for example by allowing more specialist schools .
in the countries , students without knowledge of German will be prepared in the lessons of welcome classes .
but they are not always taught by fully trained teachers , but , as in Berlin , also by teachers , who only have a qualification in German as a second language .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is no shortage of them , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Be@@ ate St@@ ones from the Berlin school administration . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the German Studenten@@ werk estimates that about 20 percent of refugees are planning to study in Germany .
in principle , no federal land asylum seek@@ ers or tolerated study - the only exception was Berlin , interior sen@@ ator Frank Henkel ( CD@@ U ) has now given up his stance .
willing refugees could be facilit@@ ated access to the university .
for refugees with a residence refund or de@@ ple@@ tion do not receive any benefits after the asylum seek@@ er &apos;s performance act when they begin a study .
the latter generally do not get a b@@ af@@ ö@@ g , as they do not fall under the circle of the b@@ af@@ ö@@ g@@ entitled persons .
patient refugees have had to live for four years in Germany to be eligible for B@@ af@@ ö@@ g , from 1 January 2016 , this span is reduced to 15 months .
but this financing gap must also be closed , call for Steffen Kra@@ ch , Berlin &apos;s State Secretary for Science , and the German Studenten@@ werk .
students should get B@@ af@@ ö@@ g straight away .
Islam will play a more important role in the future , as many refugees are Muslims , and for many , religion is an important part of their identity .
the state should gradually clean up the same rights as the churches have , and the existing state churches right to develop a new state @-@ religion relationship .
the founding of an Islamic Wel@@ fare Association , which takes care of the newcom@@ ers , would also be important .
the rights also include duties .
thus , the representatives of Islam must agree on clear contact persons and be prepared to cooperate with the state in many areas and grant him certain control possibilities .
this also includes the willingness to deal with religious fundament@@ alism .
the chairman of the Central Council of Muslims , A@@ im@@ an Maz@@ ye@@ k , expressed concern on Thursday that religious conflicts could also be carried into Germany .
those who wanted to pursue such conflicts in Germany immediately have their right to stay here , in Germany , &quot; he said in Bay@@ erischer Rundfunk .
he proposed to translate the Basic Law into Arabic .
integration will continue to be a topic of the whole society in the future .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with this the majority society will have to change , the reduction of discrimination and rac@@ ism will be more urgent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Germany - as a result of European decisions - has been an anti @-@ discrimination agency and a general gender equality law since the last decade .
but it slowly lear@@ ns how the NS@@ U mur@@ ders showed , in which police and authorities ignored the rac@@ ist motive .
equal opportunities for all : what migrants &quot; organisations and the interest groups of non @-@ white Germans have long been demanding and for which international tre@@ aties such as the anti @-@ rac@@ ism convention are committed to Germany must become reality in the coming years if the country is peaceful and its new citizens should use their possibilities - for the benefit of all .
in general , Germany is able to provide medical care for the refugees expected so far , says Frank Ulrich Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery , President of the Association .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; concerning man@@ power and capacities we create this , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said the Tages@@ spiegel . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , additional money needed to flow into the system .
in order to avoid bott@@ len@@ ecks , Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery asks all newcom@@ ers to hand out health maps right away .
services rendered could later be deduc@@ ted from the federal states .
and in the long term it is highly question@@ able to leave so many people with the limited range of services that the asylum seek@@ er law provides .
apart from that , doctors do mainly the language barriers .
already so far , the Berlin health scientist The@@ a Bor@@ de has demonstrated that migrants are more informed about their diseases than other patients .
not only in hospitals , also in doctor &apos;s sur@@ geri@@ es , interpre@@ ting costs would have to be taken over .
many refugees were also helped with more general medical centres in emergency ambul@@ ances .
and with another diagnostic view .
for example , there are much more un@@ attended obstruc@@ tions among refugees among refugees , and in young people it is about HIV clari@@ fication .
but with the partially other diseases , German doctors are making clear their training , Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery believes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the paras@@ ite inf@@ estation or tuber@@ cu@@ lo@@ sis is not so hard to recognize . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and as far as the shortage of doctors is concerned , it may even be allevi@@ ated by the refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Syrians would have developed a highly developed educational system , some refugees even doctors .
in order to practise , they would have to demonstrate their qualifications and possibly take tests again .
at least half of the refugees arriving in Germany are mentally ill according to estimates of the Federal Psycho@@ therap@@ e@@ ut@@ enk@@ ammer ( B@@ P@@ t@@ K ) : most suffer from a post@@ trau@@ matic stress disorder or depression .
refugee children , Dietrich Mun@@ z , President of the B@@ P@@ t@@ K , are particularly vulnerable .
a recent study conducted by the TU Munich proves that every fifth Syrian refugee child is traumati@@ zed in Germany .
those who are suffering from a post @-@ trau@@ matic stress disorder suffers from so @-@ called flas@@ hes with short@@ ness of breath , di@@ zz@@ iness , heart@@ beats and death sc@@ outs .
other symptoms include sleeping and concentration problems , strong fri@@ ght and emotional num@@ b@@ ness .
in order to prevent the symptoms from chronic , early treatment is necessary , explained Mun@@ z .
until now , only four percent of the mentally ill refugees have received psycho@@ therapy .
although mentally ill asylum seek@@ ers in the social offices can apply for psycho@@ therapy , the treatment usually takes several months .
in addition , in the social offices , mostly non @-@ skilled workers or doctors who are not trained for mental illnesses will decide whether a therapy is necessary or not .
this often leads to mis@@ calculations , says Mun@@ z .
Man@@ ege invites you to dream
with the new st@@ aging &quot; passion , &quot; Circus Pro@@ bst looks back on the traditions of cir@@ cus arts .
the aim is to draw every age group under the spell of fascinating ac@@ rob@@ atics , animal dres@@ sage and unique entertainment .
now the Circus Pro@@ bst invites you to dre@@ aming in the Man@@ ege on the tile .
&quot; our passion is the cir@@ cus . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I can &apos;t imagine living without my cir@@ cus family , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Stephan@@ ie Pro@@ bst , veter@@ an and junior boss . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; passion &quot; - under this motto is the current production stage .
the cir@@ cus has been in the hands of the Pro@@ bst family for more than 33 years .
the family is therefore in the blood of the gift to am@@ ate@@ urs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is important to us to take away people from their daily life and take them to a completely different world for two hours , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; emphasizes the 27 @-@ year @-@ old Juni@@ or@@ ch@@ ef@@ in . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

50 cities on the barely 3 000 km long tour can now experience this flair .
the cir@@ cus &quot; program impres@@ ses with talented artists from all over the world .
excellent at the international cir@@ cus festival in Monte Carlo , the Russian St@@ oli@@ aro@@ v C@@ lown Family captiv@@ ates the audience with charm and charm .
the Cas@@ tillo Brothers also understand their craft .
the Cu@@ ban duo will be able to easily record the Cu@@ ban duo with the heroes of silent films .
ease and ag@@ ility - with these words , they identify themselves .
her humor@@ ous art at the mast is intended to conquer women &apos;s hearts in a storm .
besides numerous salmon @-@ cla@@ ves , the ac@@ rob@@ atics of Circus Pro@@ bst also fascin@@ ate with dex@@ ter@@ ity and artic@@ ulation .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the animals belong to our family , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; emphasizes Stephan@@ ies Mother , Brigitte Pro@@ bst . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; gri@@ ev@@ ances in the attitude of cir@@ cus animals are only too often a topic among different animal welfare organizations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Stephan@@ ie Pro@@ bst looks like this : &quot; it &apos;s not good for our animals , it &apos;s not good for us either . &quot;
around 80 animals from five different continents enjoy each pet@@ ting unit .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; four @-@ leg@@ ged arti@@ stes &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; as lovingly referred to as lovingly , will be read from the eyes at every request . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we want to work with the animals and have fun with them .
if the animal does not feel comfortable , it does not want to go into the arena as well .
the top priority therefore : good for the animals .
especially on her zeb@@ roid jum@@ bo , a mixture of a Sh@@ et@@ land pon@@ y stallion and a zeb@@ ra mare , the family Pro@@ bst is proud .
the two animals lived together for eight years and nothing happened .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but then , suddenly , our little jum@@ bo was there , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Brigitte Pro@@ bst explains . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the zeb@@ roid is not ready for the arena , but it &apos;s the unique mas@@ cot of Circus Pro@@ bst .
there should be something for every visitor .
&quot; one thing is certain , &quot; Stephan@@ ie Pro@@ bst : &quot; no matter if five or 1 200 viewers , we always do our best and are with all our heart . &quot;
cir@@ cus Pro@@ bst invites its performances every day from 17 to 20 September .
on Sunday the program starts at 11 a.m. and 4 p.m .
Thursday is family day , for the performance at 5 pm the prices are reduced .
the Ti@@ ersch@@ au is open daily from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m .
Sim@@ bab@@ we@@ es Robert Mu@@ gabe holds wrong speech in parliament
Mr Mu@@ gabe , Africa &apos;s oldest leader , dropped the stairs from a podium at the beginning of the year .
he remained un@@ har@@ med , but the video of the case quickly spread across the social media .
the opening of the Parliament was also clou@@ ded by the asser@@ tions by members of the opposition that they would have received anonymous death threats and warned them to accompany Mr Mu@@ gabe &apos;s speech with inv@@ oc@@ ation .
last month , they had spread it and interrupted him during his speech on the State &apos;s position in parliament - this is the speech he repeated on Tuesday .
the spokes@@ man of the Movement for Democratic Change ( M@@ DC ) In@@ no@@ cent Gon@@ ese said that seven opposition politicians have received SMS messages on their phones that warned them to dis@@ rupt Mr. Mu@@ gabe &apos;s speech .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the message comes from a number that is not displayed , but it has the title &apos; death &apos; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said repor@@ ters to Mu@@ gabe &apos;s speech . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it warns the members of the Parliament that immunity in parliament ends , and as soon as they leave Parliament , their parliamentary immunity is no longer effective . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the chief speaker said that the party led by Morgan T@@ s@@ van@@ gi@@ ra@@ i is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; worried &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; about the dangers for politicians . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Hewlett @-@ Packard will reduce up to 30,000 jobs
Hewlett @-@ Packard is expected to build 25,000 to 30,000 jobs within the framework of restructuring and saving efforts in the company &apos;s services .
later this year , HP will split into two listed companies and separate the computer and printer business from its fast growing enterprise hardware and service business activities .
the expected job reduction will result in a burden of over 2.7 billion dollars from the fourth quarter , &quot; stated HP in an explanation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these restructuring measures will enable a more competitive , more sustainable cost structure for the new Hewlett @-@ Packard @-@ Enterprise , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Me@@ g Whit@@ man , HP chairman and Chief Executive , who will lead the unit after separation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hewlett Packard Enterprise will be smaller and more focused than it is today , and we have a broad and deep@@ ened portfolio of businesses that support businesses in transition to a new style of business , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Whit@@ man said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
as an independent company , we are better positioned than ever before to satisfy the changing needs of our customers all over the world .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hewlett Packard Enterprise has more than $ 50 billion annual revenue and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; will be focused on providing hitherto un@@ parall@@ eled , integrated technology solutions for businesses , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says a corporate statement . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it divi@@ des a company founded in the 19@@ 30s by graduates of Stan@@ ford University Bill Hewlett and Dave Packard to manufacture electrical equipment and their Pal@@ o Alto garage they called the birth@@ place of Si@@ licon Valley .
HP has gone through a massive restructuring to handle the departure of traditional PCs to mobile devices .
the measure of HP , the world &apos;s second @-@ largest PC manufacturer and one of the largest US @-@ tech companies , is the latest in this field , based on the conviction that closely focused companies provide better performance .
FC Ar@@ senal captain Mik@@ el Art@@ eta says that team @-@ mates must stand behind the injured Jack Wil@@ sh@@ ere in front of the game against Dynam@@ o Zagreb
Wen@@ ger accentu@@ ated Wil@@ sh@@ ere that it was only September , and if his rehabilitation follows plan , there is no reason why he cannot play again before Christmas .
this optim@@ istic scenario already means that Wil@@ sh@@ ere will surely miss at least the next four games for England and in the light of his history his participation will surely be uncertain in the next summer on the European Championship .
the big dis@@ grace in this current problem is that Wil@@ sh@@ ere had finished the last season after a separate ank@@ le injury and then returned to his old momentum during the previous season .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this kind of injury does not thre@@ aten career , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wen@@ ger . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is a bone that did not heal well .
this is not a major issue .
this was just an accident .
it was not in connection with his an@@ kl@@ es or with the injuries he had previously had .
this may be true from a purely medical point of view , but like Wen@@ ger also recognized , there is the associated threat of further injuries , whenever a player tries to return in the middle of the season .
it also develops an unpleasant pattern .
the study of Premier Inj@@ uries Ltd has listed 23 different diseases of Wil@@ sh@@ ere since its debut six years ago .
he also played in only 65 of Ar@@ sen@@ als 157 league games in the last five seasons .
the broader picture for ar@@ senal is that in six out of eight playing times since 2007 / 08 , it has been one of the two Premier League clubs that have recorded most of the vulner@@ ability .
Wen@@ ger has accepted the potential of a vi@@ cious circle , but ar@@ senal thinks that an improvement in the vulner@@ ability rate will last for the last season .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sometimes , when you come back from an injury , you have a due time period , a time in which you need to strengthen your body and win fighting power , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wen@@ ger said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Jack is young enough to overcome this .
I hope his body stabili@@ zes , I am confident that he will do it and he will go through a career of the way he deserves .
ar@@ senal starts its Champions League season on Wednesday evening against Din@@ amo Zagreb in front of the games against Chelsea on Saturday and against Tot@@ ten@@ ham Hot@@ spur on Wednesday , and Wen@@ ger places himself a rotation within the team .
H@@ é@@ c@@ tor Bell@@ er@@ ín and Aaron Ram@@ sey have not travelled to Croatia , which means that Math@@ ie@@ u Deb@@ u@@ chy and Art@@ eta are likely to start .
Wen@@ ger can also start with K@@ ier@@ an Gib@@ bs and Oli@@ vier Gi@@ rou@@ d instead of Nach@@ o Mon@@ real and The@@ o Wal@@ cot@@ t .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I try to keep the balance and allow the players who need it to take a short break , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wen@@ ger said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
although ar@@ senal &apos;s clear favour@@ ites are to move through group F , the Mak@@ si@@ mir stadium in Zagreb belongs to the play@@ grounds with the biggest in@@ timi@@ dation effect in Europe .
dynam@@ o continues after 41 games , after the inv@@ inci@@ ble campaign was launched during the last season .
the stadium was sh@@ attered on Tuesday evening by an earthquake measuring 3,@@ 2 on the Richter scale .
this year it was 10th in Zagreb .
Wen@@ ger believes that ar@@ senal has pulled the lesson from the past season with the Champions League captain against Monaco and remains driven by the far@@ away hope to lead the club to its first European cup triumph with its management .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this drive is immense , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wen@@ ger . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ar@@ senal never worked out .
we were very close to it in 2006 , but on the other hand I &apos;m long enough in business to be realistic .
we are ambitious , but we are not dre@@ am@@ ers .
friendship Fest : the com@@ edy show , which gives us serious lessons about male friend@@ ships
the absence of similar represent@@ ations in shows is obvious , especially with regard to how the need for men to open themselves is now even more desperate than ever before , as suicide rates among young men prove on a 15 year high .
in 2013 , it was the most important cause of death in men aged 20 to 45 in Great Britain , and it remains three times more common in men than women .
in an effort to tackle the problem , the Camp@@ aig@@ n Against Living Mis@@ er@@ ably ( Cal@@ m - campaign against a pi@@ tiful life ) was announced in 2015 as the year of the man , with the aim of asking the culture to ask the men to seek help if they need them .
friendship is the heart of the struggle to overcome this challenge .
a recent study of more than 2,000 high school students with depres@@ sive symptoms found that if the suff@@ erer had a sufficiently high percentage of friends with &quot; healthy mood , &quot; his chances of recovery were doubled .
for those who are not de@@ pressed , a circle of mentally healthy friends hal@@ ves the risks of mental problems .
but of course you have to have friends for a friendship .
in the age of communication led through social media , with its emphasis on substance on substance , the immedi@@ acy of the answer is often more important than an important contact .
our digital life has doubled the need to appear strong , li@@ ke@@ able and successful , even though in reality the isolation domin@@ ates .
this super@@ ficial success is dominated by what psych@@ ologists call ex@@ trin@@ sic values ; money , image , social status , all at the expense of intrin@@ sic values - our inner longing for personal development and friendship that affects our mental health much deeper .
and as a video game invent@@ or and billi@@ on@@ aire recently declared , money can really not buy happiness .
the beauty of Friends was that this focus was placed on the head .
each character was defined not by his work , but by his personality , which spark@@ ed through interaction as a friend .
the hum@@ our of Jo@@ ey and Ch@@ and@@ ler &apos;s frequent hu@@ gs , moments when watching football in cozy arm@@ chairs and the longing of Ross to Rachel - all this came from the knowledge that men can relate to each case even if they often reluc@@ t@@ antly explore their feelings .
as an employee of the telephone ministry explained to me , &quot; My listening role for people who feel de@@ pressed and su@@ ici@@ dal , really showed me how even the smallest interactions of friends can make a difference . &quot;
the men who contact us often feel unable to talk to friends .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the old saying &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I come with it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has an enormous effect , as the feeling that it is perceived as weakness if you talk about problems openly . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
friends is one of the shows that comes to mind when trying to offer long @-@ term cop@@ ing mechanisms .
it clearly presents the small moments of male friend@@ ships .
so much my objective out@@ sider status about the phone may help people in moments of despair , the long @-@ term support comes from a personal network of family and friends .
and so , if you visit Com@@ edy Central Friend@@ s@@ Fest this weekend to celebrate the day completely re@@ designed scenery , why then do not take your friends to a drink in Central Per@@ k .
or , even better if you see someone sitting alone in Star@@ bu@@ cks , give him a smile and say hello .
you never know which difference could make your friendship .
friends are sent to Com@@ edy Central from beginning to end - all 2@@ 36 episodes - for # Friend@@ s@@ Fest
di Maria meets to help PS@@ G break down Malm@@ ö
angel Di Maria celebrates with Bla@@ ise Mat@@ u@@ id@@ i and Ed@@ inson Cav@@ ani after his hit against Malm@@ ö .
at his debut in the Champions League on Tuesday , di Maria arrives on Tuesday and helps PS@@ G to pass by Malm@@ ö .
here are the game report and the reaction to the game .
angel Di Maria and Ed@@ inson Cav@@ ani held course when Paris Saint @-@ Ger@@ main started his Champions League season with a very comfortable 2 @-@ 0 victory against Malm@@ ö in the Prin@@ zen@@ park@@ sta@@ dion on Tuesday .
di Maria met less than four minutes after the launch of his Champions League debut as PS@@ G player , who brought the French master to the way , but afterwards they missed a number of occasions before they finally raised their lead when Cav@@ ani scored a head ball in the 6@@ 1st minute .
with Real Madrid and Schach@@ t@@ j@@ or Don@@ et@@ sk also in group A , Paris needs a strong start against the Swedish champion , as it not only asp@@ ires to the qualification for the kno@@ ck l@@ aps , but an improvement on the way to the quar@@ ter@@ fin@@ als in each of the last three campaigns .
but while they got the points , it was not a clas@@ ses@@ ame of Laurent Blan@@ cs team with Z@@ lat@@ an I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ cs missed opportunities in front of the gate . he was later replaced in the game against his home town team and against the association with which he began his illustri@@ ous career back in 1999 .
&quot; it &apos;s not easy to win at home or abroad in the Champions League . therefore , it &apos;s a good start to win 2 : 0 , cause our opponents to cause problems and look relaxed , even if there are certain things that we have to perfect over the course of the season , &quot; Blanc said .
&quot; this is a good sign .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we wanted to win and we won , although I regret that we didn &apos;t have one or two more goals scored . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after his injury I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c returned to the Paris team after his injury , which could hold a 2 : 2 decision on his own place against Bordeaux in the First league , but he was ej@@ ected in the fourth minute by Di Maria .
the Argent@@ ine@@ an wing storm was called the man who can take PS@@ G to the next level in Europe , when he was taken over in the last month of Manchester United , and he pointed out why , when he entered Marco Ver@@ rat@@ tis Pass behind the Malm@@ ö defense , before he passed off to Johan Wil@@ and passed into the long corner of the grid .
but if someone believed that PS@@ G would win a big win , he was disappointed .
Malm@@ ö , who hit Cel@@ tic in a play @-@ off to reach this stage , joined An@@ pi@@ ff with nine national players on the field and was a five @-@ man defense and two deep in the middle field lined up a heavy opponent .
but besides a shot of Nikol@@ a D@@ jur@@ d@@ j@@ ic , who passed by Kevin Tra@@ pps P@@ fo@@ sten in the 3@@ 4th minute , they offered little in the attack .
instead PS@@ G himself sometimes got up , with some mis@@ ses and bad connections , not least from I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c , who had only scrat@@ ched in the first half in the first half and then abandoned after Cav@@ ani had used it after re@@ bo@@ oting .
nevertheless he proved much more skill when he brought his fellow players into play , and it was a passport of I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c , whom Di Maria transformed into a shooting shot by Wil@@ and in the 5@@ 2nd minute at the post ...
the second gate finally fell short after the hours mark thanks to Cav@@ ani . the Urugu@@ ay@@ an achieved his sixth round of the season after I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c had found a left flan@@ k of Max@@ well .
that ended all the thought that Malm@@ ö can come back in the game , and only an excellent intervention of Wil@@ and from the shortest distance to stop David Lu@@ iz could keep the end result low before replacement players E@@ z@@ equi@@ el Lav@@ e@@ zzi have been recognized as a gate at the end .
the coach of Malm@@ ö , Age Har@@ ei@@ de , later admitted that PS@@ G played a class above his team , and the Norwegian said : &quot; our last Champions League game was last year in December .
since then , we have only played in the Swedish league , which has not the same level .
the qualifying games are not enough . &quot;
hat off in front of Paris !
it was a great game of them !
Gl@@ en@@ core G@@ athers $ 2.5 billion through shares
the mining giant Gl@@ en@@ core , which is located in Switzerland , is affected by falling commodity prices , collected $ 2.5 billion in stock sales on Wednesday as part of its huge debt @-@ identity plan .
the company Gl@@ en@@ core registered in London said in an explanation that it sold new shares worth approximately 1.6 billion pounds to pay off its own debts .

the share rose by 2.@@ 77 percent to EUR 13@@ 1.@@ 60 on the FT@@ SE 100 index , which opened 0.@@ 69 percent higher .
Gl@@ en@@ core had announced last week the 2.5 billion share sale as part of the more comprehensive plans to pay about a third of its 30 billion debt .
the company sold the new shar@@ ehol@@ dings to 125 p@@ ence per share , which meant a 2.4 percent discount on the closing price on Tuesday .
there were 1.3 billion shares worth up to 9.@@ 99 percent of the Group .
concerns regarding long @-@ term growth in China have cut iron ore prices around half , coal , copper and other commodity prices have declined by 20 to 40 percent .

X@@ av@@ i : pe@@ p Guardi@@ ola prevented 2008 switch to FC Bayern
world and European champion X@@ av@@ i has been playing for the al @-@ S@@ add Sport Club in Qatar since summer 2015
the FC Bayern was obviously shortly before the commitment of Spain &apos;s super@@ star X@@ av@@ i , who played for FC Barcelona at that time .
eight times Spanish champion , three times podium winner , four times champion league winner , two times champion world champion , twice European champion , one time World Champion - the title list of X@@ av@@ i is breathtaking .
in summer , the 35 @-@ year @-@ old left FC Barcelona after 24 years and switched to the al @-@ S@@ add Sport Club to Qatar .
but in an interview with the Mar@@ ca , X@@ av@@ i now reveals that he was already leaving Barcelona ahead of the 2008 European Championship .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I told me that Bar@@ ça is selling me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Madrid then won everything , we know nothing , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and that was also the sign of the FC Bayern .
X@@ av@@ i : &quot; there was an offer of Bavaria . &quot;
&quot; Rou@@ man@@ ig@@ ge wanted me to have me . &quot;
reminder : in the summer of 2008 , Jürgen Klin@@ smann took over the FC Bayern .
Guardi@@ ola was the reason that X@@ av@@ i did not change
but the change did not come about .
and the decisive man for this work today for the German record champion : PE@@ P Guardi@@ ola .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; X@@ av@@ i explains why : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bar@@ ça has taken Guardi@@ ola and I have played a great European Championship . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; PE@@ P told me that I wouldn &apos;t change that he couldn &apos;t imagine the team without me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; with it he got me . &quot;
who knows how Bavaria &apos;s season 2008 / 2009 would have run with X@@ av@@ i .
X@@ av@@ i stood for Bar@@ ca in the quar@@ ter@@ fin@@ als of the Champions League against the Bavarian over the entire distance on the grass , switched the reds out ( 4 : 0 , 1 : 1 ) and at the end celebrated the King &apos;s Triumph .
matt Dam@@ on Pla@@ ys Di@@ versity in Film@@ making
matt Dam@@ on faced the Af@@ ro @-@ American film@@ maker Eff@@ ie Brown during a discussion about diversity and said she is not needed behind the scenes .
during a episode of the Sunday Night of HB@@ OS Project Green@@ light , experienced actor Brown dis@@ rupted the need for alternative perspectives on a black protagon@@ ist in the project &apos;s chosen screen@@ play .
&quot; if we talk about diversity , then do it with the cast of the film and not in the cast of the show , &quot; Dam@@ on insured .
brown re@@ acted shocked , with insul@@ t un@@ belief and called &quot; Ho@@ o ! w@@ ow . okay &quot; when the comments of the actor of The Mar@@ tian strengthened .
Dam@@ on and Brown joined Ben Aff@@ l@@ eck and Far@@ rel@@ ly brothers to discuss the show fin@@ alists .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I want to encourage people to think about it - whoever will always be the director - how to treat the figure of Harmony , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; Brown first said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the only black person , and she is a lie@@ uten@@ ant beaten by her white p@@ im@@ p .
the producer of De@@ ar White People chose Leo Angel@@ os and Kri@@ sten Bran@@ c@@ accio for the film directing rights ; Dam@@ on replied that her direction &quot; at the end could give us something that we don &apos;t want . &quot;
after the discussion was broadcast , the social media explo@@ ded before dis@@ approval of Dam@@ on &apos;s comments .
Twitter users Mr Po@@ oni squee@@ zed his anger over the clip , writing &quot; Matt Dam@@ on talks about the only black person in the room , so he can explain their diversity - that &apos;s SO K@@ NO@@ WS that it hur@@ ts . &quot;
the T@@ we@@ et earned more than 5,000 ret@@ we@@ ets and 4,000 li@@ kes since its release .
Dam@@ on &apos;s comments come at a time when exact ra@@ cial representation in the media is at the forefront of social discussion .
after being killed by a white polic@@ eman in 2014 by a white polic@@ eman , the movement Black Li@@ ves Mat@@ ter achieved a nationwide impact and urged legis@@ lators and authorities to stop discrimin@@ atory practices against coloured interference .
in February the singer Prince made an all@@ usion to the movement during the launch of the nominated albums of the year at the Gram@@ my Awards .
&quot; albums still matter , &quot; he said .
like books and black life , albums still have their meaning .
more recently , leaders of the Movement Black Li@@ ves Mat@@ ter have published an explanation , in response to the question of the Fox News personality , Elisabeth Has@@ sel@@ beck , whether the group should be regarded as a group of hate .
&quot; the Network Black Li@@ ves Mat@@ ter is a love group , &quot; said the leaders .
recently it was announced that Dam@@ on was on a list of enter@@ tain@@ ers , producers and media people invited to visit the pop@@ e to discuss the representation of the Catholic Church in the West .
whether he accepted the invitation or already met the Pope is unclear .
American Nin@@ ja War@@ ri@@ or crow@@ ned first champion
professional sport clim@@ ber and operating aid Isaac Cal@@ di@@ ero became the first ath@@ lete who won the American Nin@@ ja War@@ ri@@ or on Monday evening and took home the Grand Prix of $ 1 million .
the competition show , which had just ended its 7th season , never experienced a competition participant , who could complete all stages of his obstacle course .
during the season finale there were two men , Cal@@ di@@ ero and cam@@ er@@ aman Ge@@ off Brit@@ ten , until the fin@@ als .
the last task of climbing was a 75 @-@ foot climb rope in 30 seconds .
Brit@@ ten finished the task within the time with which he was the first ath@@ lete to complete the exhau@@ sting Phase 4 of American Nin@@ ja War@@ ri@@ or . however , Cal@@ di@@ ero finished this challenge full three seconds faster , making him the winner .
Cal@@ di@@ ero spoke with E ! News after the hard @-@ won victory , still under the shock of winning the Great Prize of 1 Million $ .
&quot; I mean it &apos;s amazing to think about it , I &apos;ve never earned more than 10,000 dollars or had to live , &quot; said Isaac E ! about his he@@ ap of money .
so all of a sudden ... as I can &apos;t even imagine how this is ... the future is unknown .
the leading producer K@@ ent We@@ ed sat down with The Hollywood Repor@@ ter to discuss the final and why Brit@@ ten , although he first completed the course , won &apos;t receive any prize money .
according to the rules , money goes to the fastest person .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if there is more than one fin@@ alist , it gets the fastest time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said We@@ ed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
how much money is a wonderful price and life changes , it receives the great Gr@@ ati@@ fication .
I don &apos;t think he &apos;ll have any gru@@ dge about it .
he is just so happy to have done what he has done .
he received masses of awards from fans .
he is such a great guy and a family father .
he is a hero for his children and his wife .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ge@@ off said to me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; If I should be beaten by someone , then I am glad that it is Isaac . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and I think Isaac felt the same if they had sw@@ apped the reels .
America Nin@@ ja War@@ ri@@ or was extended for an eighth season , the shooting will start in spring 2016 .
Detroit tig@@ ers sne@@ ak past Minn@@ es@@ ota T@@ wins
MIN@@ NE@@ AP@@ O@@ L@@ IS@@ --@@ The second half of the season was not very funny for the Detroit tig@@ ers .
once they were once one of the best teams in bas@@ eball , today the tig@@ ers are at the last place in the American League Central .
the tig@@ ers are reduced to their role as spo@@ iler , but played this part perfectly on Tuesday against Minn@@ es@@ ota T@@ wins with 5 @-@ 4 in Target Field .
the T@@ wins gave a chance to climb inside one half of Houston Ast@@ ros for the second American League Wild@@ card slot .
for Detroit , al@@ beit only for one evening , it was a return of the three letter F @-@ word that was so hard to handle over a large part of the second half of the season .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all victories make fun , no matter how it comes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Tig@@ ers manager Brad Aus@@ m . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
tiger @-@ Pit@@ cher Al@@ fre@@ do Simon maintained his early offensive support when Detroit scores three times in the first two Inn@@ ings , then once in the sixth and then again in the ninth .
Simon ( 13 @-@ 9 ) proposed 6 times in the 1 / 3 inner ings and allowed three R@@ uns .
it was only his third successful start in his last nine games .
&quot; I want to end this year strongly , &quot; Simon said .
it &apos;s hard to throw each game in the bul@@ l@@ ring , and therefore I want to go very concentrated into the game .
the designated tiger @-@ Hit@@ ter Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z had three hits and was in two R@@ uns , his first R@@ BI@@ s since mid @-@ August .
it was the first three hit game of Mart@@ ine@@ z since he had four hits against the Seattle marin@@ ers on July 6th .
&quot; he has sw@@ ung the stro@@ kes , &quot; he said .
he looked good at ( punch training ) , saw much better off in the bul@@ l@@ ring , and he brought it straight into the game .
with three R@@ uns in the but@@ to@@ cks at the end of the seventh interior , the T@@ wins had their best chance to come back into play .
center Fiel@@ der By@@ ron Bu@@ x@@ ton finished the inning with a double on the left field line .
right Fiel@@ der Aaron Hi@@ cks reached a Bun@@ t , and Simon brought his second bass man Brian Do@@ zier to the Stri@@ ke@@ out before replacing the left @-@ handed Bla@@ ine Har@@ dy .
Har@@ dy over@@ ran wall , the only man with whom he was confronted , in front of the designated ro@@ ok@@ ie drummer Miguel S@@ ano , who had taken a two @-@ run dream to the right @-@ handed Dre@@ w Ver@@ hagen .
with a pair of runners and the end run on the second , Ver@@ ph@@ ages brought the third bass man Tre@@ vor Pl@@ ou@@ ffe to a double play .
it was the 27th time in the Major League this season that Pl@@ ou@@ ffe hit a double play
after finishing an insurance @-@ run at the end of the ninth interior , the wall created an R@@ BI @-@ double against the C@@ loser of the Tig@@ ers Bruce Ron@@ don and scored the stand of 5 @-@ 4 .
however , the right @-@ handed stamp proposes S@@ ano at three Pit@@ ches for his fifth save .
Detroit benefited from the start of the game from an even non @-@ moving Phi@@ l Hu@@ gh@@ es .
the tig@@ ers scored three R@@ uns in the first two inside against the right @-@ handed veter@@ an who had been painted before the game from the vulner@@ ability list after having missed more than a month because of a back pain .
&quot; obviously not the beginning that I wished for , &quot; Hu@@ gh@@ es said , &quot; but I felt more comfortable when I set off and felt that I would create some pretty good pit@@ ches in the third inning . &quot;
after receiving the Le@@ ad@@ off @-@ B@@ atter in the first place , Hus@@ him issued a single to Second Bas@@ eman Ian Kin@@ s@@ ler .
a Two @-@ Out Walk for J.@@ D. Mart@@ ine@@ z brought Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z to play a single &quot; up the middle &quot; at the first run of the game .
Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z managed his 0 @-@ 21 series of successes with the runners in the scor@@ ing position .
the third player Nick Castell@@ an@@ os followed with a single on the right , managed another run , but Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z was thrown out of the game when he tried to get to the third , which ended the threat .
the tig@@ ers placed in the second , achieved a one @-@ out double by Cat@@ cher James Mc@@ C@@ ann and a Two @-@ Out Single from Center Fiel@@ der Anthony GO@@ SE to 3 @-@ 0 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was a big blow , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said T@@ wins manager Paul Mol@@ it@@ or . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he wasn &apos;t particularly well beaten , but he got the right place .
Hu@@ gh@@ es was in a pitch Count , scored no points in the third inning before being replaced by the reli@@ ever right @-@ handed A.@@ J.@@ A@@ chter .
Hu@@ gh@@ es came to three R@@ uns in six hits and a walk with four stro@@ kes .
remarks : Tig@@ ers R@@ HP Ani@@ bal San@@ che@@ z retired due to a violation of the throwing guil@@ ders .
he is examined by Dr. James Andre@@ ws who operated the San@@ che@@ z Sh@@ oul@@ der in 2007 .
San@@ che@@ z , since mid @-@ August on the vulnerable list because of a shoulder pad , is to be activated for launch on Wednesday .
with San@@ che@@ z from the game , L@@ HP Daniel Mor@@ ris is removed from the vulner@@ ability list to launch against the T@@ wins .
Nor@@ ris with 1 @-@ 1 at four starts with the tig@@ ers since he was acquired in exchange with L@@ HP David Price on July 30
he has been missing in the right hip joint since August 20 .
the Tig@@ ers and the T@@ wins will end their series of three games at Target Field on Wednesday
Nor@@ ris ( 2 @-@ 2.@@ 4.@@ 43 ER@@ A ) will play against Minn@@ es@@ ot@@ as R@@ HP Er@@ vin Sant@@ ana ( 5 @-@ 4 , 4.@@ 73 )
hundreds of refugees are expected to come in Wiesbaden

up to 1,000 refugees can temporarily stay there .
they shall then be distributed to other municipalities .

Frankfurt and Han@@ au have also established emergency shel@@ ters in sports halls due to the large number of refugees .
Isch@@ inger : German military action in Syria an option
the head of the Munich Security Conference , Wolfgang Isch@@ inger , holds military measures with German participation in Syria for an opportunity .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think the decisive reflection on military action options must not take place without Germany , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he accused the European states of &quot; collective austerity . &quot;
four years ago , one was happy that the ch@@ ali@@ ce passed by a military participation in Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now the conflict lands on our door@@ step , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in Deutschl@@ and@@ funk . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the former German ambassador in Washington also called for a massive increase in international aid on the spot for refugees .
Austria controls on southern and eastern borders
after Germany , Austria again introduced controls to its southern and eastern borders .
on Tuesday evening in Austrian television broad@@ ca@@ ster ORF , Austrian Interior Minister Joh@@ anna Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner stated that no one will be sent back to Hungary .
Germany also sent no refugees back to Austria .
&quot; no , that &apos;s so agreed , &quot; she explained .
on the question of an agreement to which Germany could take up a certain number of refugees from Austria per day , Mik@@ l Leit@@ ner said , there have already been discussions between the General Director for Public Safety and Repres@@ ent@@ atives of Germany .
she did not call her concrete figures and pointed out talks on Wednesday in Berlin .
during the last days tens of thousands of refugees came to Austria via the so @-@ called Balkan Route .
their goal is mostly Germany .
Chancellor Angela Merkel ( CD@@ U ) and her Austrian colleague Werner F@@ ay@@ mann requested a special summit for next week together with several other EU leaders .
Germany started on Sunday with temporary border controls .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the EU states have so far not agreed to a common approach in the crisis . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the EU interior ministers want to take a new approach to the binding distribution of another 120@@ ,000 refugees on Tuesday ( 22 September ) at a special meeting .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in view of the strong refugee camp in Germany , the federal government wants to support the countries in the initial up@@ take and distribution of people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the federal government will manage this together with the countries , and on the late Tuesday evening , Merkel announced after almost four hour consultations with the Prime Minister in the Chanc@@ ellery in Berlin .
Merkel under@@ lined that those people who need protection would get this also .
but if you don &apos;t have a pen@@ al perspective , you can &apos;t stay in Germany either .
this view was strongly dealt with in the round .
the Chancellor stressed that the state as a whole must now face a &quot; huge effort of force . &quot;
thousands of desperate refugees are now stuck on the Balkan route .
Hungary closed its 175 @-@ kilomet@@ re @-@ long border with Serbia in the night of Tuesday .
a few hours later the government announced in Budapest to lock the border with Romania with a fence .
this neighboring country is different from Serbia to the EU .
Hungary wanted to prevent tu@@ g@@ boat ev@@ asive routes over Romania , Hungary &apos;s Foreign Minister Peter S@@ zi@@ j@@ jar@@ to said to the planned new border fence .
the Romanian government immediately condemned the plan .
there were first ar@@ rests of people who had cut the fence .
in Turkey , according to e@@ ye@@ witness reports , thousands of other migrants arrived on the way to the Greek border .
space probe &quot; Cass@@ ini &quot; finds ocean on Satur@@ n@@ mond En@@ cel@@ a@@ dus
under the ice @-@ p@@ anz@@ er of Saturn &apos;s En@@ cel@@ a@@ dus , a global ocean sw@@ aps .
this includes researchers from observations of the space probe &quot; Cass@@ ini . &quot;
accordingly , the moon stag@@ gers easily on its orbit around the ring planets .
although this de@@ af movement is only small , but too big for a solid cel@@ esti@@ al body , it is said in a message from the Corn@@ ell University in I@@ th@@ aca ( US State New York ) on Tuesday .
the researchers present their analyses in the journal &quot; I@@ car@@ us . &quot;
it was already known that there must be liquid water under the ice cover of En@@ cel@@ a@@ dus .
in 2006 , &quot; Cass@@ ini &quot; had already discovered ice vul@@ can@@ es at the south pole of the Satur@@ n@@ monds , sp@@ itting water vap@@ or and ice particles and thus feeding the so @-@ called E @-@ ring of Saturn .
at least on the South Pole , there must be a sub@@ terranean sea , the astronom@@ ers closed back then .
however , the expansion of the hidden ocean was not clear .
R@@ ama missing in Munich several weeks
in 1860 , Munich has to disp@@ ense with Val@@ det R@@ ama , an offensive player .
an investigation led to an ab@@ duc@@ tor violation at the 27 @-@ year @-@ old , the association informed .
R@@ ama had been compl@@ aining about pain at the beginning of the week .
according to Munich @-@ based lions , the diagnosis is &quot; probably four weeks of forced break . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is hard for us , R@@ ama is a bitter loss . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course , we must think now , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Sports Director Nec@@ at Ay@@ gü@@ n the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bild &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; newspaper with a view to the possible commitment of a seamless professional . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , the six@@ ties presented a defensive man as training guest .
the 30 @-@ year @-@ old Hr@@ vo@@ je C@@ ale was last active in Belgium and was already under contract at the V@@ f@@ L Wolfs@@ burg .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Cro@@ at is now &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the opportunity to prove his skills . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

no diet fruit - man@@ goes contain lots of sugar
man@@ goes are exotic and juicy @-@ sweet .
but he who wants to pay attention to his slender line is often rather dis@@ cour@@ aged by them .
man@@ goes contain relatively high sugar - especially su@@ c@@ rose .
the exotic fruits are healthy nevertheless : in them B @-@ vitamins and vitamins E and C. In particular , man@@ goes contain a lot of vitamin A and its prec@@ ursor beta @-@ carot@@ ene .
those who eat the fruits therefore support vision , immune system and metabolic processes in the body .
when buying , man@@ gos should not be too soft or too firm and smell pleasantly .
the peel color alone says nothing about how ripe the fruit is - so also green man@@ gos can taste delicious .
they should be stored at room temperature and eaten within a few days .
then they taste pure or in sweet foods .
but a man@@ go gives a special note also hear@@ ty dishes .
it sof@@ tens the slightly bitter taste of some leaf salads like Chi@@ cor@@ ee and Ra@@ dic@@ cio .
and a Man@@ go@@ ch@@ ut@@ ney fits well with fish , poultry , lamb and game .

on Wednesday and in the night to Thursday , the hair @-@ dryer blows partially with a storm @-@ strength through the fo@@ eh@@ n @-@ valleys .
after F@@ öhn@@ ende on Thursday morning we cross a distinctive cold front that brings strong rainf@@ alls , wind gu@@ sts and a temperature back .
as Met@@ e@@ o@@ News writes in a message , Switzerland is currently on the front of an extensive low @-@ pressure area above the British Is@@ les in a powerful southwest current .
on the side of the Alps , the f@@ öhn winds through the valleys on the night .
as a result , the F@@ öhn blows in the fo@@ eh@@ n valleys with bows from 60 to 100 km / h , isolated and partly in the Ur@@ ner@@ land partially also with over 100 km / h .
the hair @-@ dryer can reach the adjacent Mitt@@ ell@@ and in some places , and on the mountains even hur@@ ri@@ can@@ es of over 120 km / h are possible .
while in the north on Wednesday there is a stor@@ my hair @-@ dryer for summer temperatures of 23 to 27 degrees , the humidity begins to st@@ ow at the Alpine slope .
here rain begins , which lasts until Thursday evening .
in total , in the next 48 hours , more than 100 liters of rain per square meter must be bil@@ led to the south of the Alps .
on Thursday morning the air is blowing from the fo@@ eh@@ n , as a result , a cold front rolls with a strong , partially swe@@ at@@ y rain from west to east via Switzerland .
together with the cold front the wind dev@@ ours strongly to stor@@ my , and temperatures go back considerably .
the following days present themselves in the north with 15 to 20 degrees , in the south , on the other hand , it will be sunny and warmer at the weekend with up to 25 degrees .
Rome now has a Martin Luther Place
almost 500 years after the Reformation , there is now a Martin Luther Place in Rome .
in the presence of Mayor Ign@@ a@@ zio Marino on Wednesday a nam@@ eless place in the park on the O@@ pp@@ io Hill was christ@@ ened on the name of the German Re@@ former .
in the &quot; Piazza Martin Lu@@ ter@@ o &quot; he is now honoured as the &quot; German The@@ ologi@@ an of the Reformation . &quot;
the park is located in the middle of the old Rome next to the Col@@ os@@ se@@ um .
the nam@@ ing was requested by the Association of Protestant Churches in Rome .
Jens @-@ Martin Kr@@ use , pastor of the Evangel@@ ical Lutheran congregation in Rome , reminded on Wednesday that the Protest@@ ants in the city of the Pop@@ es could often only live in secret their faith in the city of the Pop@@ es as a minority .
in a symbolic way , the place becomes visible that the tradition of Christian faith in Rome is welcomed .
Martin Luther ( 14@@ 83 @-@ 15@@ 46 ) was a young August@@ inian mon@@ k at the turn of the year 15@@ 10 / 11 a few months in Rome .
at that time , he felt the city as a dec@@ aying sin @-@ b@@ abel .
his negative impressions are likely to have strengthened him according to histori@@ ans in his later struggle against Rome .
Luther had then initiated the division of the Western Church with his theses against Ab@@ las@@ h@@ el .
hammer Artist invested three years in the personal interpretation of the Bible
Jesus with the gold @-@ gold crown is one of the main works that Ot@@ mar Alt has painted for his Bible .
Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost wrote the introduction and updated Bible texts .
at the beginning was the Word ?
no , not at the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Bible , which has now been published with gorgeous pictures .
at the beginning was the picture for Ot@@ mar Alt , who formulated his very personal interpretation of biblical stories on paper and canvas in 150 motifs .
the 75 @-@ year @-@ old has received his &quot; language &quot; with colourful colors and imagin@@ ative forms - but what is by no means syn@@ onymous with &quot; funny &quot; pictures .
on the contrary : adapted to the respective themes , it can be quite dark .
Ot@@ mar Alt has worked on his bi@@ ble project for about three years , for which he has made a subjective and artistic selection from the many subject areas of the book of all books .
these are cycles that dev@@ ote themes such as cross @-@ path , pl@@ agues , bi@@ ds , or fa@@ ther@@ land .
he has thus spontaneously fascinated several partners : this applies to the Luther @-@ Verlag with its the@@ ological orientation as well as for the Kettler publishing house with its focus on art books .
and there is mainly the author Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost , who has dealt with the respective Bible passages on the basis of painting .
he has interpreted the biblical passages selected by Ot@@ mar Alt and translated into today and in current contexts . &quot;
these texts are like verbal mirrors of Al@@ ts painting .
they are embedded between the original quotation of Martin Luther and one set of the artist who formulated his very personal thoughts on the situation .
the jewelry cord has golden letters .
thus , the 75 @-@ year @-@ old allows twice a deep insight into his soul , his emotions .
this is a high degree of in@@ timacy .
emotions were ultimately the trigger for the Bible project : Ot@@ mar Alt , born 1940 in Wer@@ ni@@ ger@@ ode and grew up in Berlin , comes from a family that belonged to the strict Protestant Herr@@ n@@ hu@@ der Order .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since the up@@ bringing happened already with the cane , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ot@@ mar Alt rec@@ alls . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I tried to work out that , in order to be able to bear with the Lord again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his second concern is to revi@@ ve art in the quick@@ est possible time : &quot; the perception of visual worlds today is shaped by advertising , and that is loud .
symboli@@ sm is being supp@@ ressed .
artists have a different desire and delight to show things .
pictures always have something mysterious and are not decorative .
&quot; in this respect I am a din@@ osau@@ r . &quot;
Ot@@ mar Alt wants viewers to &quot; fall into &quot; the images , let them work on themselves , discover and sense what power they have : &quot; the image is looking for its counterpart . &quot;
Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost was standing on Tuesday at the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Stiftung &apos;s presentation in the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Stiftung , &quot; always &quot; a lover of Ot@@ mar Al@@ ert &apos;s art : &quot; I like him to live with his pictures . &quot;
I have not paid attention to fully compreh@@ ending the Bible but also chosen the most important , mysterious themes for him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was not a collaboration at eye level , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Alt@@ ep@@ ost says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is about the pictures , the text only explains . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for Hans M@@ öh@@ ler of Luther @-@ Verlag , this work is an invitation to deep@@ en his life and find freedom . &quot;
Ot@@ mar Al@@ ts &apos;s pictures speak for M@@ öh@@ ler both the ( biblical ) language of love as well as the responsibility .
a part of the origin@@ als - Paper and Lin@@ en Images - will be presented for the first time in an exhibition opened on 15 November in the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Stiftung .
start of construction for BM@@ X railway
plans made , place found , company mand@@ ated , ground level model@@ ed for a circuit : one year later almost everything was finished - but before the official opening of the BM@@ X train it was finished again .
om@@ is@@ sions in politics and administration ensured dr@@ unk@@ enness , especially in the residents who did not want to tolerate the railway .
so hill slo@@ ped , new place wanted - now with formal planning and application for building permission .
the approval will be published in October , the first common member Sabine Mos@@ eb@@ ach @-@ Bo@@ ck has now been able to communicate in the children &apos;s and youth committee .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I hope that this year will happen again , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it should then be started without &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; another memorial &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the work in the former indoor pool . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
DF@@ B intensi@@ fies commitment to refugees
the DF@@ B extends its commitment to refugees from 2019 , while Bundes@@ lig@@ a puts a clear signal on the weekend .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the soccer respon@@ ds to the situation in Germany and sec@@ ures its help in tackl@@ ing the problems encountered . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I consider this for the biggest challenge of our country since re@@ unification . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no one can say , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that doesn &apos;t matter to me , I have nothing to do with it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this must interest each individual to get a grip on this issue , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said DF@@ B boss Wolfgang Ni@@ ers@@ bach . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the annual meeting with German Chancellor Angela Merkel on 23 September in Berlin , he wants to discuss the refugee situation in Germany intensively .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am in the Chanc@@ ellery the next Wednesday and meet the Minister for State , Ms Ö@@ zo@@ ğ@@ u@@ z and the Chancellor . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there will certainly be a central role in the issue , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he announced . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
football can and will help .
but the decisive course must put the policy .
for this reason , the German Football Association has expanded its refugee initiative &quot; 1 : 0 for a welcome &quot; for four years .
&quot; over the E@@ gi@@ di@@ us @-@ Braun Foundation , we have ensured that this programme will continue until 2019 , &quot; stated Ni@@ ers@@ bach on the fr@@ inge of the UEF@@ A meeting in St. Julian &apos;s / Malta .
some federal states also support this program .
already this weekend , the 36 professional associations put a clear sign when they will support the print &quot; We help - # Refu@@ ge@@ es@@ Welcome &quot; on the left @-@ hand jer@@ sey instead of the usual sponsor@@ ship logo ( Her@@ mes ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to make it clear that everyone should help wherever and how they can , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Le@@ verk@@ us@@ ens Sport Chief Ru@@ di Völ@@ ler in the &quot; Bild &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; newspaper ( Tuesday ) and described the project as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; self @-@ evident &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the refugee drama goes on everyone , nobody can see it away . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we can use our jet power , influence and possibilities to help the many refugees who have suffered so incredibly , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Her@@ tha @-@ Manager Michael Pre@@ etz . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
H@@ offen@@ heim &apos;s managing director Peter Ret@@ tig spoke of a &quot; prominent sign of the league . &quot;
on this Friday the national team of women invites 100 refugees to Halle / Sa@@ ale .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ni@@ ers@@ bach called the support of refugees as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a large community of German football . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
that all 36 lic@@ en@@ sees had started their own projects in their places was great .
just as great is that small and smallest clubs are active .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the message &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 1 : 0 for a welcome &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we spent is lived in football . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is of enormous importance , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in this and the next year , the association , together with the DF@@ B election and the federal government , provides 300@@ ,000 euros for the integration of refugees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the clubs have also called up the whole sum for 2015 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ni@@ ers@@ bach reported . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
reports : SAP CEO loses eye in accident
according to Bill Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t , CEO of Europe &apos;s largest software company , Bill Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t , re@@ port@@ edly lost his left eye due to a fall in early July .
in the accident on the stairs in his brother &apos;s house in the USA he fell on a water glass after midnight , which he carried in his left hand , reports the &quot; Wirtschafts@@ Woche &quot; on Wednesday .
&quot; he is almost bleeding , he was power@@ less , got out of the road - he told us this last week , &quot; quoted the &quot; Wi@@ Wo , &quot; SAP co @-@ founder Has@@ so Platt@@ ner .
but Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t was able to pursue his work .
&quot; at the beginning of October , we met before the Supervisory Board meeting in Wall@@ dorf , &quot; Platt@@ ner said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the 54 @-@ year @-@ old manager is at the meeting and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fully work@@ able &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t announced in an interview with the &quot; Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung &quot; ( Thursday edition ) , he will come back to Germany in October and continue to lead the software company .
&quot; I &apos;m full for SAP , full in my job . &quot;
&quot; of course I was in regular contact with the Supervisory Board and its chairman Has@@ so Platt@@ ner , &quot; said Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t the &quot; S@@ Z . &quot;
Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t usually comm@@ utes between Germany and the USA , but since summer he was no longer in the German SAP headquarters in Wall@@ dorf .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is important to him to go to the public with such a personal story , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; S@@ Z , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; can happen . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is important to stand up again if you have fallen . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mc@@ L@@ aren replacement pilot Magn@@ us@@ sen except battle ...

S@@ occ@@ er : Bv@@ B without Re@@ us vs K@@ ras@@ no@@ dar : wil@@ de@@ f@@ eller in the gate
at Bor@@ ussi@@ a Dortmund all hopes for a com@@ eback by Marco Re@@ us have finally broken down in the first group game of the Europa League .
the national player will also be missing the table leader of the Bundes@@ lig@@ a in Du@@ el with the F@@ K K@@ ras@@ no@@ dar on Thursday ( 19.@@ 00 pm / Sky ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; unfortunately , we cannot fall back on it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Thomas Tu@@ ch@@ el on Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
whether Re@@ us will be back on Sunday at the Bundes@@ lig@@ a Top@@ spiel vs. Le@@ verk@@ usen , the BV@@ B @-@ Coach left open : &quot; we expect a return from him to the training on Friday . &quot;
in view of the high intensity of its pro@@ s , Tu@@ ch@@ el will not only change its stem cell on the Re@@ us position .
so he announced a change to the door@@ way position .
this is why Roman Wei@@ den@@ f@@ eller takes the place of Roman citizen Roman Br@@ ush .
&quot; he trains at an absolute top level , &quot; the football teacher praised the world champion .
however , if Wei@@ den@@ f@@ eller is used in all Europa League games in the future , Tu@@ ch@@ el remained open .
with a high lik@@ el@@ ihood , he will also play the second game .
the for@@ sche statement by Mit@@ player Re@@ us , that the final appeal for the BV@@ B in the Europa League must be the target , mid @-@ field player Julian W@@ eig@@ l considers understandable : &quot; thus Marco is not that wrong . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think we have a good chance to pick up the title . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
robot cars : government wants to play a pioneering role in Germany
according to the will of the Federal Government , Germany should be a technological tra@@ il@@ bla@@ zer in the transformation of the car .
on Wednesday , the Federal Cab@@ inet decided on a strategy paper from the house of Minister of Transport Alexander Do@@ brin@@ dt ( CS@@ U ) , which , among other things , fores@@ ees investments in the expansion of digital infrastructure .
Do@@ brin@@ dt spoke on Wednesday in Frankfurt on the ver@@ ge of the IAA Motor Show from a &quot; new mobility era . &quot;
automated and connected driving will increase road safety and ensure less traffic , &quot; said Do@@ brin@@ dt .
he also wants to discuss the subject with his colleagues from the G@@ 7 states , who also come together with representatives from the industry at the IAA .
among other things , the strategy paper of the Ministry of Transport emphas@@ ises the importance of mobile broad@@ band expansion and rapid growth on digital radio stations .
a test track on the motorway 9 in Bavaria is currently being tested for testing new technology .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in order for the driver &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no additional liability risks be imposed , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Federal Government wants to review the legal framework conditions and , where necessary , adapt to the new developments . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for example , Germany wants to use internationally that the maximum speed for self @-@ driving cars is increased from 10 to 130 kilometres per hour .
the Federal Government also wants to apply for a change in the Vienna Convention , which until now only sees the human being as a driver .
with automated driving , the car increasingly takes the lead , and the driver becomes more and more the passenger .
the technology is based mainly on sensors and cameras that capture the environment and process the data in seconds .
according to a study presented by the Ministry of Economy , highly automated driving on motor@@ ways by 2020 will be technically possible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nevertheless , dri@@ ver@@ less vehicles on public roads are &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not to be expected &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; until 2020 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the value added in the field of driver assistance systems and highly automated driving functions in Germany is estimated by the authors of the study for 20@@ 25 to around 8.4 billion euros .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the digital networking of passenger cars can lead to increased safety and efficiency in road traffic , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said SPD traffic politi@@ cian S@@ ören Bar@@ to@@ l . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , the question of liability in case of accidents and the safety of the personal data of the drivers must be clari@@ fied clearly .
however , the Germans are still skep@@ tical - much more than French or Americans .
a survey conducted by the For@@ sa Institute on Wednesday at the audit firm Dek@@ ra conclu@@ des that only eight percent of Germans believe that autonomous driving cars will prevail over the next ten years , 32 percent count only in 20 years with it , 31 percent do not believe at all .
in France , 21 per cent of respon@@ dents count to 20@@ 25 with autonomous driving cars , 33 per cent in the US .
anyway , drivers in Germany are not yet ready to rely completely on a self @-@ prop@@ elled vehicle .
following an up@@ lift of the Bit@@ kom digital network , only seven percent would agree to give control over the entire journey on all roads .
at the motorway , the traffic in flowing traffic could still be 15 percent , in traffic 45 percent .
a good every fourth would leave the car under no circumstances .
B@@ oll says team and double start with table tennis Euro
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Dus@@ sel@@ dorf wants to hit only one single after the title fight between September 25 and October 4 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the final decision is to be made at the latest on September 22 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a huge loss for our team . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the boys experienced it in the morning . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but we are strong enough to pick up the title even without Timo , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bun@@ de@@ builder Jörg Ro@@ ß@@ kopf during the European Championship in Düsseldorf . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at that time B@@ oll was on the flight to a long @-@ term sponsor@@ ship in China .
the 34 year old German champion is expected back on Friday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; without Timo is the down@@ side , we are no longer such a clear favourite , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said single European champion Dimit@@ ri@@ j Ov@@ t@@ char@@ ov . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Ham@@ el@@ ner , who leads the S@@ etz@@ list in Y@@ ek@@ ater@@ in@@ burg , also rec@@ alled the European Championship in Sch@@ wech@@ at .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at that time Timo also lack@@ ed and we became European champion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; in this we should orient@@ ate ourselves , &quot; declared the fifth @-@ fifth .
the English football player Luke Sha@@ w of Manchester United has suffered a serious injury on the right leg .

Gau@@ l@@ tier feels too old for an en@@ f@@ ant terrible
it is a mixture of a very large fashion show and a wax figures Gr@@ us@@ el@@ cab@@ in@@ ett : the designer Jean Paul Gau@@ l@@ tier ( 63 ) presented an exhibition on his work on Wednesday in Munich .
the highlights : display mannequins , which look horri@@ bly human thanks to video projections .
they bear the spectacular creations of the French designer , who , among other things , became the great star of the fashion scene with Mad@@ onn@@ as &apos;s stage out@@ fits - and that he put men in skir@@ ts .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today I can no longer say that I am the f@@ ant terrible of hau@@ te cou@@ ture because I have white hair . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; in the past it was ble@@ ached , now it &apos;s real , &quot; Gau@@ l@@ tier said .
for the visitors of the exhibition &quot; From The Side@@ walk To The Cat@@ walk &quot; ( From the side@@ walk to the cat@@ walk ) , which is to be seen in the Kunsth@@ alle of the Hyp@@ o @-@ Kultur@@ stiftung from 18 September at the Kunsth@@ alle of the Hyp@@ o @-@ Kultur@@ stiftung , it is a good idea that the fashion designer has changed his attitude towards a show of his person .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for me an exhibition sounded a bit after death , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
when you die , you come to the museum .
the impressive collection had previously been made in Montreal and Paris .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s about so much more than just beautiful dresses , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the director of the Kunsth@@ alle , Roger Di@@ e@@ deren . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is about tolerance , acceptance and the vision of an open society .
the exhibits give an insight into the hardly surprising work of the man who has written fashion history without ever having completed an apprenticeship .
chron@@ ologically , the show is not built up , but it is a super@@ bly choreograph@@ ed overall art work , for which much effort was spent : in order to freeze the d@@ olls , for example , an especially sty@@ list was engaged .
according to the cur@@ ator Thierry @-@ Maxim@@ e L@@ ori@@ ot , the makers have drawn 14 tons of material to Munich .
just before the start of the October festival there was still a special treat : a le@@ der@@ h@@ osen outfit with cor@@ set .
Hei@@ di meets Madonna .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he was always interested in strong women ( &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Women are smar@@ ter than men &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) and for people who are a bit different , Gau@@ l@@ tier said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Gau@@ l@@ tiers of old Ted@@ dy can also be seen in the exhibition .
he stands for the first , tent@@ ative , fashionable attempts of the designer .
as a child ( he was not a good student and bad in football ) he wore his Ted@@ dy B@@ H@@ s and clothes , Gau@@ l@@ tier said .
his parents would not have allowed him to play with a doll .
he later taught himself the dis@@ car@@ ding of fashion .
he st@@ ole fashion magazines and looked at the designs of other designers as Gau@@ l@@ tier said in Munich .
later I bought them , of course .
for his first own fashion show he did not have to pay the models .
they did not get anything but were allowed to keep the clothes .
jewellery instead of curtain - P@@ lau@@ ener tip as fashion niche
in the past it went to the long embroi@@ dery machines in and around P@@ lau@@ en to make meters .
the embroi@@ dered fabrics and lace were produced in large quantities for customers , which they used for example to cover ceilings and she@@ ers .
this alone is no longer working , says Andreas Rein@@ hardt , Managing Director of the Mo@@ eb@@ itze P@@ lau@@ en .
instead , fashion is again important .
in the early days of the P@@ lau@@ ener Spitze , fashion played a major role , was then displaced by the textile industry - and is now re@@ discovered as a niche .
Rein@@ hardt names some examples : lace in jewelry , accessories like bags and regional costumes .
in general , the so @-@ called vintage fashion , borrow@@ ed from past styli@@ stic periods , represents an increasing order potential .
those who do not use niche in the textile branch in Germany are no longer on the market .
with us , they already make half of all orders .
together with nine other companies , Mo@@ eb@@ itze P@@ lau@@ en is a member of the branch association P@@ lau@@ ener Spitze and embroi@@ dery .
only they may wear the protected label .
in the last 15 years , around 80 percent of sales have been broken away .
private specialist shops and wholesale dealers are almost no longer available .
our products hardly reach our customers in this way .
the mass @-@ ware is now produced much cheaper in the Asian region and is sold almost exclusively via chains .
in addition , exports , currently to Russia and the United States , are weak@@ ening .
so there are enough reasons for new ways .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the industry association also tries to score points in terms of environmental awareness , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; C@@ ord@@ ula Bauer &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains in Fal@@ k@@ enstein : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this year we have a quality seal showing that we produce ec@@ ologically and socially acceptable . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Rein@@ hardt compl@@ ements : &quot; this applies to the materials used . &quot;
graduate designer U@@ te Schmidt teaches at the Schne@@ e@@ berg branch of the West@@ sächs@@ ische Hochschule Z@@ wick@@ au - at the Faculty of Applied Arts - special@@ ising in embroi@@ der@@ ies and lace .
to counter the competition from the Asian region one has to find high @-@ quality and innovative products .
this takes time and courage .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is a tension between the fresh@@ est ideas of designers and businesses that need to think more economically , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Schmidt . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
therefore an existing design is often only slightly varied in order to maintain a customer base .
some years ago , textile designer Kat@@ i Reu@@ ter re@@ invented the historic snow@@ ball peak .
the machine suff@@ oc@@ ates small chi@@ cks in some places .
the P@@ lau@@ ener gol@@ ds@@ mi@@ thing master Bianca Hal@@ leb@@ ach @-@ K@@ rau@@ ße was inspired : &quot; before that , I couldn &apos;t start with traditional P@@ lau@@ ener Spitze . &quot;
now she uses the snow@@ ball tip for her jewelry .
in a complex process , she shapes the pattern in silver .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many people in the region identify with the topic of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; P@@ lau@@ ener &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - young and old , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Reu@@ ter says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it also supplies in the USA , to Australia and to Finland - especially to customers whose ancestors lived in P@@ lau@@ en and its surroundings and who would like to have a mem@@ ento .
with this I see my jewellery as the modern ambassador of the P@@ lau@@ ener Spitze .
Disney plans new &quot; Mary P@@ opp@@ ins &quot; movie
legends shouldn &apos;t be touched , but Disney nevertheless dar@@ es a new film of his classic &quot; Mary P@@ opp@@ ins . &quot;
according to &quot; Entertainment Week@@ ly , &quot; however , it is not about a re @-@ movie , but a kind of continuation that takes 20 years after the first movie with the magical n@@ anny .
it is about the experience of N@@ anny with the B@@ anks family in times of the Great Depression in England .
those who play P@@ opp@@ ins more than 50 years after Ju@@ lie Andre@@ ws is still unclear .
but the director already stands firmly : Ro@@ b Marshall , last with &quot; In@@ to the W@@ oods &quot; at the cinema .
XI ur@@ ges to open the economy wide for the world
the economy needs to open wide out@@ ward to promote growth , President X@@ i J@@ in@@ ping said on Tuesday of a group charged with the steering of reform .
&quot; China should focus on attrac@@ ting foreign investment and know @-@ how and improving the strategies for business start @-@ ups , &quot; he spoke in a speech at the 16th session of the Central Executive Committee for the deep@@ ening of a comprehensive reform .
promoting new start @-@ ups and promoting reforms will bring new momentum and vitality and offer new space for economic growth , said X@@ i .
the management group has adopted a number of guidelines including a negative list to control the market access , relaxation of border controls policy , promotion of state enterprises ( SO@@ E ) , private capital , and over@@ haul of the population reporting system .
after the statement , a negative list is created to identify sectors and companies that are not eligible for investments .
the system is tested gradually and improved by test programs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the initiative is important since it as@@ signs a major role to the market in the allocation of resources , guarantees a legal business environment and open the market more frank@@ ly , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the statement . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the government will also lo@@ osen controls on the powers transferred to companies and ensure that companies decide how to conduct their business . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the statement also said that China will allow border areas to explore new models of cross @-@ border economic cooperation and new mechanisms to promote regional growth .
as part of an offer to open state controlled sectors , further areas are opened for private investment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the government will not change its policies towards foreign investments and will protect the legitimate interests of foreign @-@ funded companies and provide better services for them , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the statement . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , it is easier for foreigners to apply for a permanent residence permit or &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Green Card &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by optimizing the requirements and making the application process easier . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the right of lawyers to guarantee their activity and use professional judges and prosec@@ ut@@ ors was also discussed at a meeting . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the meeting , Prime Minister Li Ke@@ q@@ i@@ ang and important leaders such as Li@@ u Y@@ un@@ sh@@ an and Z@@ hang Ga@@ oli participated as announced in a statement published after the meeting .
EU wants to double mercury limit in pre@@ dat@@ ory fish
the European Commission wants to double the limits of mercury in large pre@@ dat@@ ory fish and thus increase the consumption of a much higher dose of the nervous gifts .
the consumer organisation F@@ ood@@ watch , who has received a corresponding EU working paper , sharply critic@@ ised the plans : &quot; risks and side effects of failed industrial and environmental policies are passed with full force to pregnant women and to@@ dd@@ lers , &quot; explained Matthias Wolf@@ sch@@ midt of F@@ ood@@ watch .
according to Wolf@@ sch@@ midt , the limit values of the nerve poison for large fish at the end of the food chain such as shar@@ k or s@@ wor@@ d@@ fish are to be raised from one to two milli@@ grams of mercury per kilogram of fish .
however , large pre@@ dat@@ ors are already so heavily loaded with mercury , that on the basis of the currently valid limit values , about 50 per cent of the cat@@ ches may not be sold .
after dou@@ bling the limit values , only 14.@@ 5 percent would be un@@ sal@@ eable .
according to F@@ ood@@ watch , the EU wants to ag@@ grav@@ ate limit values for other fish from currently 0.5 milli@@ grams to 0.1 milli@@ grams of mercury per kilogram .
but F@@ ood@@ watch described this as a &quot; trick &quot; because smaller c@@ emet@@ eries such as car@@ p are usually bur@@ dened so low that they keep the planned maximum values already today .
the lowering of the rh@@ einf@@ all is therefore &quot; a per@@ fi@@ de distra@@ ction manoeu@@ vre that helps the economy alone , &quot; says Wolfgang Sch@@ midt .
mercury is a heavy metal which is highly po@@ ison@@ ous for humans , which is particularly rich in pre@@ dat@@ ory fish over the food chain .
the German government therefore warns that &quot; already low amounts can &quot; cause damage to the nervous system , particularly in the case of un@@ born damage .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Federal Environment Ministry declares on its homepage with regard to the current maximum values , however , that a &quot; health hazard to the general population &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is not to be expected . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
mercury is primarily caused by the burning of coal into the environment .
according to a written information from the Federal Environment Ministry , the German coal @-@ fired power stations b@@ ump more than six tonnes of mercury in the year , two @-@ thirds of the total amount of mercury issued in Germany .
the concentration of mercury in fish , for example in Elbe , Rhine and Danube , was &quot; permanently and comprehen@@ sively exceeded , &quot; the &quot; Spiegel &quot; quoted from the paper in March .
last year , Europe @-@ wide warnings of mercury in fish have already been among the most commonly reported health risks in the EU warning system RA@@ S@@ FF .
