with the exception of disputes concerning the Council in accordance with Article 19 or any of the measures taken by the Council , disputes arising from the interpretation or application of this Convention shall be settled upon request of a party based on an arbit@@ ral tri@@ bunal , consisting of five arbitr@@ ators .
the community and the states appoint two arbitr@@ ators , the organization also design@@ ates two arbitr@@ ators , and the four arbitr@@ ators named so called elect a fifth that leads the chair@@ manship .
if the Community and the States or the organization have not named two arbitr@@ ators within thirty days of the application , the Community or the Organisation may request the President of the International Court of Justice to appoint these arbitr@@ ators .
the same procedure must be applied if the fifth arbitr@@ ator has not yet been elected within thirty days of the appointment or appointment of the fourth arbitr@@ ator .
a majority of the members of the Ar@@ bit@@ ration Court is competent and all resolutions require the approval of at least three arbitr@@ ators .
the decisions of the Ar@@ bit@@ ration Court are binding for the organization , the community and the concerned states .
a ) This agreement applies to non @-@ nuclear weapons , the contracting party of the contract and become members of the Community , in force , i ) if the concerned state of the organization notes that its procedures are concluded for the entry into force of the Convention and
II ) if the association of the organization notes that it is able to apply its security measures with regard to this state for the purposes of this Convention .
a ) The organization , the community and the states consult each other on request of one of the contracting parties for a change of this Convention .
B ) All changes require the consent of the Organization , the Community and the States .
C ) The General Director shall immediately inform all Member States of the Organization of any amend@@ ment to that Convention .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the term &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Convention &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; which is used in this agreement means the Convention and the Protocol . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the purpose of this part of the Convention is to specify the procedures to be applied when implementing the provisions of Part I on securing measures .
the aim of the securing measures laid down in this Convention is the timely detection of the diver@@ gence of significant amounts of nuclear power from peaceful nuclear activities for the production of nuclear weapons and other nuclear explo@@ sives for unknown purposes as well as deter@@ rence from such an abor@@ tion by the risk of premature discovery .
in order to enrich the target specified in Article 28 , material accounting is used as a backup measure of fundamental importance , combined with the spatial input and observation as important complementary measures .
the technical conclusion of the follow @-@ up inspections by the organization is made by means of an explanation in which for each material balance zone , the amount of material determined for a certain period of time is specified , stating the accuracy limits for the specified amounts .
in carrying out their review , the Organization shall make full use of the Community &apos;s security system in accordance with Article 3 .
the accounting and control system of the Community of Nu@@ clear Material in accordance with this Convention is based on a division into material balance zones .
when applying their security measures , the Community of de Proced@@ ures and Meas@@ ures will make use of the following kind of use and , if necessary , fores@@ ee how they are determined and useful in the supplementary agreements :
a ) a measuring system for determining the amounts of preserved , produced , lost , lost or otherwise removed core material and stock quantities ;
( B ) the evaluation of reproduci@@ bility and accuracy of measurements and estim@@ ation of measurement uncertainty ;
C ) procedures for determining , checking and evaluating differences in the measurements of sender and recipient ;
e ) procedure for ass@@ essing the accumulation of non @-@ measured stocks and non @-@ measured losses ;
( F ) a protocol and reporting system , which indicates the core material stock for each material balance zone and the changes in this inventory , including the inputs and outputs of the material balance zone ;
g ) precau@@ tions to ensure that the accounting procedures and agreements are carried out correctly ;
h ) Proced@@ ures for the reimbur@@ sement of reports to the organization in accordance with Articles 59 to 65 and 67 @-@ 69 .
the securing measures in accordance with this agreement do not extend to material used in mining or ore processing .
B ) Ur@@ an - or th@@ ori@@ fic material , which has not yet reached the phase of the nuclear fuel cycle described under letter c ) , is introduced into the states , so the community of the organization shares the quantity and composition of the material provided that it is not introduced for specific non @-@ nuclear purposes ;
C ) leaves core material suitable for composition and purity for fuel production or is@@ ot@@ ope accumulation , the plant or process phase in which it is produced or is introduced into the states in a later phase of the nuclear fuel circuit , so it is subject to the other security measures mentioned in this Convention .
a ) The provisions set forth in this Convention are terminated for core material under the conditions specified in Article 11 . however , if the conditions specified in Article 11 are not fulfilled , the Community is considered that the recovery of nuclear material , which is subject to security measures according to this Convention , is temporarily un@@ available or desired , so the organization and the community consult each other on the application of suitable security measures .
B ) The security measures envis@@ aged in this Convention shall be terminated for core material under the conditions specified in Article 13 , provided that the Organization and the Community are unanim@@ ous that this core material is practically non @-@ ref@@ und@@ able .
at the request of the Community , the organisation fre@@ es the following core material from the security measures according to this Convention :
a ) special fis@@ sile material , if it is used in gram - or smaller amounts as a sensor in instruments ;
B ) Nu@@ clear material if it is used for non @-@ nuclear activities pursuant to Article 13 , if such core material is re@@ cover@@ able , and
C ) Pl@@ ut@@ oni@@ um with an is@@ ot@@ ope concentration of Pl@@ ut@@ oni@@ um @-@ 2@@ 38 , which is over 80 % .
on request of the Community , the Organization shall exemp@@ t the core material that would otherwise be subject to securing measures in accordance with this Convention , provided that the total quantity of nuclear material liber@@ ated pursuant to this Article in the States is at no time greater than
a ) a total of one kil@@ ogram of special fis@@ sile material that can consist of one or more of the following materials :
( II ) Ur@@ an with an enrich@@ ment of 0.2 ( 20 % ) and above , calculated by multip@@ lication of his weight with enrich@@ ment ,
III ) Ur@@ an with an enrich@@ ment , which lies below 0.2 ( 20 % ) and above the nature ur@@ an@@ ium , calcul@@ ates by multip@@ lication of its weight with the fifth square of accumulation ;
B ) a total of ten metric tons of natural ur@@ an@@ ium and depl@@ eted ur@@ an@@ ium with enrich@@ ment of more than 0.00@@ 5 ( 0.5 % ) ;
C ) Tw@@ enty metric tons of depl@@ eted ur@@ an@@ ium with an enrich@@ ment of 0.00@@ 5 ( 0.5 % ) or below ;
if the core material is to be processed or stored together with core material which is subject to the security measures pursuant to this Convention , precau@@ tions for the re @-@ application of the securing measures are taken on that material .
the community encounters with the organization supplementary agreements which are necessary to the extent that is necessary for the successful and effective execution of the tasks of the organization according to this Convention , in detail how the procedures established in the Convention are to be applied .
the supplementary agreements can be extended or amended without any amend@@ ment to the agreement between the organization and the community .
the supplementary agreements occur simultaneously with or as soon as possible after the entry into force of this Convention . the organization , the community and the states undertake all the efforts to make these agreements come into force within nin@@ ety days after the entry into force of this Convention ; an extension of this period requires the agreement between the organization , the community and the states .
the organization provides on the basis of the initial report stated in Article 62 , a summari@@ zed inventory of the entire core material underlying the security measures of this Convention in the states , regardless of its origin , and carries out this inventory on the basis of the following reports and the results of their review .
between the European Economic Community ( EEC ) and its Member States , Belgium , Denmark , the Federal Republic of Germany , France , Ireland , Italy , Luxembourg , Netherlands , United Kingdom ( Member States ) on the one hand and the International Development Organisation ( Organization ) on the other
the EW@@ G has decided to contribute to the special action programme established at the conference for international economic cooperation in order to help meet the immediate needs of individual countries with low income , whose development is hin@@ dered by general resource problems .
C ) It is the objective of the EEC and Member States that the entire contribution made by the Member States is bound within six months of the entry into force of the agreement and as far as possible within two years after entering into force in the form of loans , and the organization will do its utmost to achieve this goal .
D ) The EEC and the Organization have consul@@ ted each other about the proposed implementation and management of this agreement and the central bonds in order to ensure a broad and balanced geographical distribution within the framework of this agreement .
to this end , the Organisation of the EEC submitted a table showing the manner in which it intends to apply the criteria specified in this Agreement -
the organization establishes a special account under the name &quot; special transactions account , &quot; which is made up of funds which the Member States contribute to the special transactions account in accordance with this Agreement ( in this property the organization is referred to as &quot; ste@@ ward &quot; ) , and only to the purpose specified in this Agreement and in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement .
the special transaction account is managed separately and separated from all other accounts and assets of the organization .
the fees must be paid as follows : a ) The payment is made in the form of cash or in@@ significant notes of the member state , which are to be paid on demand in the currency of the respective state at order of the organization as administrator of the special account and to be deposited in the place of deposit of the organization in the country concerned .
B ) The payment is made in two install@@ ments ( i ) the first in the amount of at least 45 v . h . the contribution within 30 days after the entry into force of this agreement or another between the EEC and the administrator agreed upon ;
II ) the second in the amount of the remaining amount of the contribution to 1 January 1979 or at any other time agreed between the EEC and the administrator , taking into account the deadlines required for parliamentary approval of the annual budget plans .
C ) Every@@ one Member State may be able to make payments before the aforementioned dates .
according to the usual procedures of the organization , the administrator assumes approximately proportional pulling on the cash or the training notes to cover the expenses for the special loan and balance the special transaction account in an appropriate manner .
in case of granting of these loans , the administrator can be guided by the following factors in accordance with the conditions of the EEC :
III ) the extent to which international economic factors contributed to the country &apos;s current and fores@@ eeable economic problems ;
( VI ) the composition and the tendency of the country &apos;s debt service and its additional lending capacity to loan terms without discount ; and
VII ) the extent in which the problems of the countries concerned can be regulated by contributions from other sources .
each special transaction loan is used to finance a clearly defined and fast @-@ rep@@ ay@@ able development program or project ( including a sec@@ toral project ) , whether it belongs to the loan programme of the organization , or not , according to the procedures and practices that are considered , approved , approved and managed by the proper means of the organization , the aim of this agreement stated under letter b ) of the pre@@ am@@ ble to this agreement .
the funds of the Special Trans@@ action Account may not be used instead of the Bank &apos;s Bank &apos;s Bank for Rec@@ on@@ struction and Development ( Bank ) or the organisation which has been approved by the Bank or the Organization &apos;s directors on the day of the entry into force of this agreement .
apart from section 4 , special transactions are subject to the same rep@@ ay@@ ment terms which are generally applicable to the development loan granted by the organization ; thus , they are rep@@ ay@@ able in ten years in each case in 50 years .
special transactions are granted in one or more currencies of the Member States and are rep@@ ay@@ able in these currencies .
amounts for the payment of this duty must be paid directly to the organization that it retains .
each special transaction loan is to be issued by a separate loan agreement between the recipient country and the administrator , in which particular the origin of the means is given .
the proceeds from each promotional loan can be used for expenses in the currency of the recipient country or for goods or services manufactured ( ii ) in a Member State ; ii ) in developing countries , which are members of the organization and which , according to what the administrator has specified at the time of loan granted , could be the recipient of a special loan loan .
capital rep@@ ay@@ ments of a special transaction are to be paid to the special account , and the amount paid in that way in the currency of a member state shall be re@@ mitted as soon as possible by the administrator to the Member State concerned .
until complete awar@@ ding of all special transactions , the Administrator informs the EEC concerning the plans and programmes approved by the directors in preparation for the examination by the directors .
during the period of the payment of the special transaction , the car@@ et@@ aker instruc@@ ts the EEC quarterly on the development of the special loans and the expendi@@ tures made for this purpose .
as soon as possible , the administrator shall send a detailed account of the special transaction account with an opinion from the external audi@@ tor of the organization to this account conclusion as soon as possible after the end of the financial year of the organization .
following a full payment of the special transaction loan , the administrator of the EEC submitted a detailed report on the projects and programs financed by the special transactions account as soon as possible .
the administrator creates and performs appropriate records and accounts from which the contributions are made to the special transactions account , which are deduc@@ ted from the account recei@@ v@@ ables resulting from the account and the amounts paid out of the account and the withdraw@@ als to the Member States .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the EEC and the car@@ et@@ aker work closely together to achieve the goals of this agreement . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
to this end , the EEC ( represented by the Commission of the European Communities ) and the administrator up to the complete issue of the means of a special transaction account from time to time provide an exchange of ideas about the state of the special transactions account , the progress of programmes or projects financed by special transactions , and about all other issues relating to the provisions of this Agreement .
if this agreement has not entered into force on 31 December 1978 , or at a later date , which the EEC and the Organisation may agree , the agreement and all obligations of the parties resulting there@@ from shall be due immediately .
if the entire capital amount is rep@@ aid in accordance with Article II Section 8 of this Agreement and re@@ mitted to the Member States , this agreement and all obligations of the parties resulting from this are terminated with immediate effect .
this agreement requires approval by the individual Member States and the EEC as per the proced@@ ural provisions of each party .
the governments of the Member States are noti@@ fying the Sec@@ retariat of the Council of the European Communities to termin@@ ate the procedures involved .
the Sec@@ retariat shall pass these noti@@ fications along with a Noti@@ fication on the Ord@@ in@@ ance on the Reg@@ ulations of this Agreement by the EEC to the Organization .
this agreement becomes effective and enters into force on the first day of the month following the date of receipt of the stated notification in the organization .
this agreement is written in two documents in Danish , German , English , French , Italian and Dutch , with each wording equally binding .
considering that the agreement in the form of a letter change to the amend@@ ment of An@@ nex A of the Protocol No. 1 to the agreement between the European Economic Community and the Swiss Con@@ federation ( 1 ) is to be closed - HA@@ T en@@ acted the following issue :

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I would be grateful if you confirm your government &apos;s consent to the foreg@@ o@@ ing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
agreement in the form of a letter exchange between the European Economic Community and the Bank for International Sett@@ lements
the BI@@ S could close stand@@ by credit schemes with the central banks of the credi@@ tor countries if the banks make a corresponding request .
the agreement could be closed up to the total amount of the contribution paid by the credi@@ tor to the mechanism , within a total limit of 2.@@ 7@@ 25 billion invo@@ icing units ; this corresponds to 50 % of all future delivery funds from the member countries .
however , some conditions have already been mentioned below , for whose application the BI@@ S would be ready .
with each stand @-@ by @-@ credit , the BI@@ S would initially assume an obligation for two years , with the possibility of extension levels , but without a total of five years .
with the opening of loans as well as for any extension , the BI@@ S would charge a credit opening fee .
in addition , it would be agreed that the first dra@@ fts will not be made prior to exp@@ ir@@ ation of the stand@@ by agreement , so that the bank can make the necessary adjustments to their own liquidity .
the draw would take place in the currencies available in the BI@@ S at the conclusion of the agreement at the disposal of the agreement , most likely in US dollars ; they would extend to periods based on the funds of the Bank , presumably three or six months .

within the framework of this agreement , the export opportunities for H@@ amm@@ el , lamb and goat meat from Uruguay are determined by the Community to the following annual amount :
in order to ensure a flaw@@ less functioning of the agreement , Uruguay is committed to ensure that the quantity agreed in the year does not exceed the agreed quantity and is carried out in accordance with conventional offer forms ( frozen or chill@@ ed ) .
if a change in the Offer form is possible as a result of changes in technology and trade , the two parties of this agreement consult each other prior to introducing such a change in the Committee cited in paragraph 10 in order to find an appropriate solution .
in the event that the Community uses the safeguard clause , it obli@@ ges itself to ensure that the Urugu@@ ay@@ an &apos;s approach to the Community market is not affected by this agreement .
in the event that imports from Uruguay exceed the agreed quantities in one year , the Community reserves the right to susp@@ end imports from Uruguay for the rest of the year .
the community comm@@ its itself to limit exhaus@@ tion to the import of products recorded by this agreement to a ho@@ ech@@ st set of 10 b.@@ H . ad val@@ or@@ em .
in the entry of new Member States , the Community in consultation with Uruguay will change the amount prescribed under number 2 corresponding to the amount of Urugu@@ ay@@ an trading with each new Member State .
the import burden for these new Member States shall be determined in accordance with the provisions of the Acc@@ ession Treaty ; this will take into account the above @-@ mentioned ho@@ ech@@ ing set of de@@ ple@@ tion .
the total quantity stated under number 2 is determined by the day of Greece &apos;s accession to the Community to 5,@@ 800 tonnes of slaughter body weight .
the community under@@ takes everything to avoid market development which could imp@@ air the marketing of Urugu@@ ay@@ an h@@ amm@@ el and lamb meat on the common market within the agreed quantities .
in particular , the Community is taking precau@@ tions so that the sales of stocks of frozen meat are not under@@ min@@ ed due to the implementation of the Ord@@ in@@ ance on the conduct of the Urugu@@ ay@@ an conductor .

a re@@ agent for blood group determination must react with all tested blood samples containing the an@@ tigen which is hom@@ olog@@ ous to the antibody or any other substance on the label .
if a re@@ agent is used in the manner recommended by the manufacturer , the following factors or phenomena may not occur : a ) hem@@ oly@@ tic properties ;
the ti@@ ter is measured twice in a suitable medium by repeatedly dil@@ uting the re@@ agent to be examined .
the ti@@ ter is the reci@@ pro@@ cal value of the number of the strongest serum di@@ lution in which a reaction occurs ; di@@ lution is calculated exclusively of the volume of the blood cell in@@ undation in the total volume .
in the case of anti @-@ A , anti @-@ B or other re@@ agents , which are to be used on slides , the activity is expressed by the time required for ag@@ glut@@ ination on an object carrier .
the World Health Organisation has set standards for anti @-@ A and Anti @-@ B as well as in@@ complete anti @-@ D re@@ agents for blood group determination of international standards , and for re@@ agents of other specific@@ ity are elabor@@ ated at the time standards .
according to definition , an international standard preparation contains a certain number of international units per mg or ml , and this definition is independent of the ti@@ ters observed in individual preparations of red blood cells ( 1 ) .
( 1 ) The effectiveness of re@@ agents for blood group determination of most specific@@ ity is expressed as ag@@ glut@@ in@@ ation@@ sti@@ ter , which is observed in a series of di@@ lu@@ tions in an er@@ y@@ thro@@ cy@@ te sedi@@ mentation .
the ti@@ ter gives the di@@ lution of the re@@ agent in the last mixture within a series where a micro@@ scopic visible ag@@ glut@@ ination occurs .
the effectiveness of re@@ agents for blood group determination , available for the International standard preparations ( at the time Anti @-@ A and Anti @-@ B as well as incomplete Anti @-@ D ) , can be expressed on the basis of the re@@ organization of the unknown re@@ agent in comparison to the International standard preparation or a state statute in international units ( see Bul@@ letin WHO O@@ MS 1954 , 10 , 9@@ 37 , 9@@ 41 - 1950 , 3 , 301 . ) .
if you bring them back to a volume of 1 ml , the Anti @-@ A and Anti @-@ B S@@ eren contain 256 International units per ml according to definition .
the preparations are available free of charge from the International Laboratory for Bi@@ ological Standards of the World Health Organization , Stat@@ ens Ser@@ um Institut , Copenhagen .
the following table shows an example of a comparative ti@@ tr@@ ation of the international standard anti @-@ A ( S ) and an &quot; unknown &quot; anti @-@ A re@@ agent ( U ) against red blood cells A1 and red blood cells A@@ 2@@ B . &gt; P@@ IC FI@@ LE = &quot; T@@ 00@@ 4@@ 50@@ 83 &quot; &gt;
if a re@@ agent is stored under the conditions recommended by the manufacturer , its necessary characteristics should be maintained for at least one year .
the exp@@ iry date of a re@@ agent in liquid form according to label lies at most a year after the last satisfactory effectiveness test .
the date of exp@@ ir@@ ation date on the label depends on the results of the durability tests ; it is approved by the state regul@@ ators .
dry re@@ agents are stored in an atmosphere of in@@ ert gas or in a vacuum , in the glass container in which they have been dried and which is closed so that no moisture can penetrate .
a dry re@@ agent may lose at most 0.5 % of its weight if it is tested by further drying via phosph@@ or@@ pent@@ oxi@@ des in a pressure of no more than 0.@@ 02 mm Hg within 24 hours .
in order to avoid bacterial growth , the competent state authority can determine that an anti@@ sep@@ tic and / or antibiotic is added to the re@@ agent ( or the solvents supplied with the dry re@@ agents ) , provided that the re@@ agent with the added substance continues to fulfill the requirements for specific@@ ity and effectiveness .
sera human origin for blood group determination must contain at least 2.5 mg protein nitrogen per ml liquid or re@@ dissolved serum .
re@@ agents , whether in liquid form or after re @-@ dissolution , must be transparent and may contain neither sedi@@ ments nor gels or visible particles .
the re@@ agents appointed for the international exchange of blood group determination should not be arti@@ fici@@ ally dy@@ ed as long as it is not until an international agreement reached a unified system .
re@@ agents for blood group determination are to be distributed in such quantities and in such quantities , that the re@@ agent located in a container is not only sufficient to carry out tests with unknown blood cells , but also to carry out tests with positive and negative control blood cells .
the quantity in a container must be so large that the content may be used to carry out the efficacy tests described in this protocol .
the manufacturer laboratory has to carry out written notes on all stages of production and control of re@@ agents for blood group determination .
appropriate samples of all spent re@@ agents can be stored for a long time by the laboratory until it is likely that the batch is no longer used .
the re@@ agents used for blood group determination can contain substances of human , animal , plant ( or mineral ) origin ; some of these represent the effective part , the others are the necessary aids to strengthen the effectiveness and maintain the stability of the re@@ agent .
for technical reasons these re@@ agents are divided into three groups according to the origin of their effective part .
this does not mean that the re@@ agents of human origin contain only substances of human origin or that animal or herbal re@@ agents cannot contain substances of human origin .
each container has a black and white printed label in English and French , containing the following information : 1 . name and address of the manufacturer ,
4. the quantity or quantity of the re@@ agents , the quantity and composition of the liquid required for re @-@ dissolution ,
in addition , this label or label on the box in which the individual containers are located , or the instructions attached to the containers , contain the following information : 1 . full name and address of the manufacturer ,
3. the quantity or quantity of the re@@ agents , the quantity and composition of the liquid required for re @-@ dissolution ,
