<seg id="1">ZUSATZABKOMMEN on the agreement between the European Economic Community and its Member States and the Swiss Confederation on watchmaking</seg>
<seg id="2">Given that, on June 30, 1967, an agreement was signed between the European Economic Community and its Member States and the Swiss Confederation of watchmakers in Geneva,</seg>
<seg id="3">Considering that it is necessary to take additional measures with regard to a frictionless functioning of this agreement,</seg>
<seg id="4">Given the decree of the Swiss Federal Council of 23 December 1971 on the use of the Swiss name for watches,</seg>
<seg id="5">In view of the close industrial cooperation between the European Economic Community and Switzerland in the field of the watch industry,</seg>

<seg id="9">From these blanks and individual parts assembled clocks and movements must meet the requirements of legal technical control in Switzerland.</seg>
<seg id="10">2. the list of raw works produced in Paragraph 1 is revised periodically according to the following modalities:</seg>
<seg id="11">A) The application for the inclusion of new raw materials in the list is directed by the associations of the watchmaking industry of the community or by the manufacturers of crude works in the Swiss watchmaking chamber. the application is accompanied by a technical description of the raw material caliber.</seg>
<seg id="12">The Swiss watch-bunting spars this or the new caliber immediately in the so-called list.</seg>
<seg id="13">If the inclusion in the list for a raw material caliber is applied, which has already been used in Switzerland and has not passed the statutory technical control in Switzerland, the Swiss watch Chamber can refuse admission.</seg>
<seg id="14">B) The withdrawal of the raw materials listed in the list will be communicated by the associations of the watchmaking industry of the Community or from the manufacturer who had previously requested the reception of the Swiss watchcase.</seg>
<seg id="15">C) If the requirements of statutory technical control are not fulfilled in Switzerland, the Swiss watch Chamber may request the cancellation of the raw material caliber from the list; it will inform the party concerned thereof.</seg>
<seg id="16">If this does not agree, it may take the procedure in paragraph 3 within two months.</seg>

<seg id="20">In view of this expertise, the institutes are able to draw on a game of watches or movements from a Swiss company and a company of the community, which is sufficiently representative and basically no more than 50 watches or movements.</seg>
<seg id="21">After checks of these games in accordance with the norms of legal technical control in Switzerland, the institutes compare their results and prepare a joint report for the Joint Commission with their conclusions and with their suggestions.</seg>
<seg id="22">The agreement and the list attached to it will be published in the official publication organs of the contracting parties and communicated to the watchmakers by the respective professional associations.</seg>
<seg id="23">At least every three years, calculated from the entry into force of the agreement, the Mixed Commission is taking a redesign of the list to take account of the recent entries and matches.</seg>
<seg id="24">The agreement entered into force on 1 January 1973, if the ratification certificates were replaced until this date.</seg>

<seg id="855">In addition, it would be agreed that the first drafts will not be made prior to expiration of the standby agreement, so that the bank can make the necessary adjustments to their own liquidity.</seg>
