this document is a summary of the European Public Transport Report ( EP@@ AR ) , which explains how the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) has assessed the studies carried out to make recommendations regarding the use of the drug .
if you need more information about your illness or treatment , please read the packaging template ( also part of the EP@@ AR ) or contact your doctor or pharmac@@ ist .
if you would like more information on the basis of the recommendations of the CH@@ MP , please read the scientific discussion ( also part of the EP@@ AR ) .
it is available as 5 mg , 10 mg , 15 mg and 30 mg tablets , as 10 mg , 15 mg and 30 mg of melting tablets ( tablets that dissolve in the mouth ) , as a solution for intake ( 1 mg / ml ) and as an injection solution ( 7.5 mg / ml ) .
B . wir@@ y thinking and speaking , hall@@ u@@ cin@@ ations ( hearing or seeing things that are not present ) , di@@ str@@ ust and del@@ u@@ sions ; • Bi@@ polar @-@ I distur@@ b@@ ance , an emotional condition in which the patients have alternate episodes of normal mood alter@@ nat@@ ely with periods of normal mood .
Abi@@ li@@ fy is used to treat moderate to severe man@@ ic episodes and to prevent man@@ ic episodes in patients who have addressed the medicine in the past .
the injection solution is used for quick control of increased distur@@ b@@ ance or behavi@@ our@@ al disturbances when oral consumption of the drug is not possible .
in both cases , the solution to take @-@ in or the melting tablets can be applied in patients who have difficulty swal@@ lowing tablets .
in patients who are taking other medicines at the same time as Abi@@ li@@ fy , the dosage of Abi@@ li@@ fy should be adjusted .
this interfer@@ es with the signal transmission between brain cells by &quot; neur@@ otran@@ smit@@ ters , &quot; i.e. chemical substances that enable the communication of nerve cells .
Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole probably mainly acts as a &quot; partial ag@@ on@@ ist &quot; for the recept@@ ors for the neur@@ otran@@ smit@@ ters dop@@ amine and 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amin ( also called ser@@ oton@@ in ) .
this means that Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , such as 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amin and dop@@ amine , has a smaller degree than the neur@@ otran@@ sm@@ itter to activate the recept@@ ors .
as dop@@ amine and 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amin play a role in schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar disorder , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole helps to norm@@ alize the activity of the brain , thereby reducing psych@@ otic or man@@ ic symptoms and preventing their recur@@ rence .
the effectiveness of Abi@@ li@@ fy to prevent the recur@@ rence of symptoms has been studied in three studies for up to one year .
the effectiveness of the injection solution was compared to two studies in 80@@ 5 patients with schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia or similar disorders that were suffering from increased un@@ rest over a period of two hours with a placebo .
in another study , Abi@@ li@@ fy was compared to 3@@ 47 patients with hal@@ operi@@ dol , in another study the efficacy of Abi@@ li@@ fy and placebo to prevent recur@@ rence in 160 patients in whom the man@@ ic symptoms had already been stabili@@ zed with Abi@@ li@@ fy .
the efficacy of Abi@@ li@@ fy injection solution was compared in a study of 301 patients with bi@@ polar disorder , suffering from increased un@@ rest , with the treatment of Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am ( another anti@@ psych@@ otic medication ) and placebo over a period of two hours .
in all studies , the change in the patient &apos;s symptoms was investigated using a standard bi@@ polar disorder or the number of patients who responded to the treatment .
the company also conducted studies in order to investigate how the body absor@@ bs the melting tablets and the solution for inhal@@ ing .
both studies with injection solution showed patients who received Abi@@ li@@ fy in doses of 5.@@ 25 mg , 9.@@ 75 mg or 15 mg , a significantly greater reduction in symptoms of increased anxiety than the patients receiving placebo .
in the treatment of bi@@ polar disorder , Abi@@ li@@ fy was more effective than placebo in four of the five short @-@ term studies .
in addition , Abi@@ li@@ fy prevented for up to 74 weeks more effective than placebo for the recur@@ rence of man@@ ic episodes in previously treated patients and , if administered in addition to an existing treatment .
abili@@ fy inj@@ ections in 10 or 15 mg doses were also more effective than placebo for the symptoms of increased un@@ rest and were similar to Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am .
the most common side effects of Abi@@ li@@ fy ( observed at 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are extra@@ py@@ ra@@ mid@@ al disturbances ( un@@ controlled tick ) , depression , blur@@ red vision , dy@@ sp@@ ep@@ sia ( di@@ sti@@ p@@ ation ) , fatigue and exhaus@@ tion , rest@@ lessness , in@@ som@@ nia ( sleep disorders ) and anxiety .
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that the advantages of Abi@@ li@@ fy in the treatment of schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia and of moderate to severe man@@ ic episodes in patients with mainly man@@ ic episodes and in which the man@@ ic episodes were related to treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole were out@@ weighed against the risks .
moreover , the committee came to the conclusion that the benefits of injection solution in rapid control of increased distur@@ b@@ ance and behavi@@ our@@ al disorders in patients with schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia or in patients with man@@ ic episodes in bi@@ polar @-@ I @-@ disorder , if oral therapy is not suitable , out@@ weigh the risks .
in June 2004 , the European Commission issued approval for the marketing of Abi@@ li@@ fy across the European Union .
Abi@@ li@@ fy is indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe man@@ ic episodes of bi@@ polar disorder and for the prevention of a new man@@ ic episode in patients who had mainly man@@ ic episodes and whose man@@ ic episodes were related to treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole ( see section 5.1 ) .
the recommended starting dose for Abi@@ li@@ fy is 10 or 15 mg / day at a maintenance dose of 15 mg / day daily regardless of meals .
increased efficacy in dos@@ ages over a daily dose of 15 mg was not proven although individual patients can benefit from a higher dose .
the recommended starting dose for Abi@@ li@@ fy is 15 mg once a day , independent of meals as mon@@ otherapy or combination therapy ( see section 5.1 ) .
the efficacy of Abi@@ li@@ fy in the treatment of schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar disorder in patients ≥ 65 years has not been proven .
in consideration of the greater sensitivity of this group of patients , a lower initial dose should be considered when clinical factors are justified ( see section 4.4 ) .
if the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 In@@ duc@@ tor is removed from the combination therapy , the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l dose should be reduced to the recommended dose ( see Section 4.5 ) .
the occurrence of su@@ ici@@ dal behavior belongs to psych@@ otic diseases and aff@@ ective disorders and was reported in some cases after on@@ set or after change of an anti@@ psych@@ otic therapy , also in treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) .
results of an epide@@ mi@@ ological study showed that in patients with bi@@ polar disorder there was no increased suicide risk with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l compared to other anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics .
Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole should be used with care in patients with known cardiovascular disease ( m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction or isch@@ em@@ ic heart disease , heart failure , over@@ current disorders ) , cereb@@ rov@@ ascular diseases , conditions that pre@@ dispose for hyp@@ ot@@ onia ( de@@ hydr@@ ation , hypo@@ vol@@ a@@ emia , treatment with blood pressure lowering drugs ) or hypertension ( including ac@@ o@@ cel@@ eri@@ zed and malign@@ ant form ) .
3 Sp@@ ät@@ dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia : in clinical studies that lasted a year or less , there were occasional reports of dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia occurring during treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l .
if signs and symptoms of a late dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia are treated with Abi@@ li@@ fy , patients should be taken into consideration to reduce the dose or break down the treatment .
if a patient develops signs and symptoms that suggest a M@@ NS , or a clear high fever without an additional clinical manifestation of M@@ NS , all anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics , including Abi@@ li@@ fy , must be dismissed .
therefore , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole should be used with caution in patients with sei@@ zur@@ es in the an@@ am@@ n@@ esis or in conditions related to sei@@ zur@@ es .
56 - 99 years with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l in patients with psycho@@ sis associated with Alzheimer &apos;s disease had patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole an increased risk of death compared to placebo .
however , there was one of these studies , a study with fixed dosage , a significant relationship between dosage and response for un@@ desirable cereb@@ rov@@ ascular events in patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole .
hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia , in some cases extremely and associated with k@@ eto@@ aci@@ dosis or hyper@@ os@@ mol@@ ar coma or death , was reported in patients treated with at@@ yp@@ ical anti @-@ psych@@ otic agents including Abi@@ li@@ fy .
there are no exact risk assessments for hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia @-@ related adverse events associated with Abi@@ li@@ fy and other at@@ yp@@ ical anti @-@ psych@@ otic agents to allow direct compar@@ isons .
poly@@ di@@ p@@ sy , poly@@ ur@@ ie , pol@@ yp@@ ha@@ gia and weakness ) are observed and patients with diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus or with risk factors for diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus should be monitored regularly in relation to a deterioration of glucose levels .
weight gain is generally observed in schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ic patients and in patients with bi@@ polar disorder due to com@@ or@@ bi@@ di@@ ties , the use of anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics , in which weight gain is known as a side effect or an un@@ healthy lifestyle and might lead to serious complications .
due to the primary effect of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole on the central nervous system , caution is advised when Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole is used in combination with alcohol or other central effective drugs with over@@ bearing side effects such as se@@ dation ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) .
the H@@ 2 antagon@@ ist fam@@ oti@@ dine , an ga@@ stri@@ c acid blo@@ cker , reduces the res@@ or@@ ption of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , but this effect is considered clin@@ ically not relevant .
in a clinical study with healthy volunteers , a highly effective C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 inhibit@@ or ( Ch@@ ini@@ dine ) increased the AU@@ C of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole by 107 % while the C@@ max remained unchanged .
it is expected that other highly effective inhibit@@ ors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 , such as flu@@ ox@@ et@@ ine and par@@ ox@@ et@@ ine , have similar effects and therefore similar dos@@ ages should be made .
in C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 &apos; bad &apos; ( = &quot; poor &quot; ) metabolism , the joint application with highly effective inhibit@@ ors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 can result in higher plasma concentrations of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in comparison to C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 Exten@@ sive Met@@ abol@@ ism .
considering the joint application of k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole or other highly effective C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors with Abi@@ li@@ fy , potential benefits should out@@ weigh the potential risks for the patient .
other highly effective inhibit@@ ors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , such as I@@ tra@@ con@@ az@@ ole and HIV prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , are likely to have similar effects and therefore similar dose reductions should be made .
after placing the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 or 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ or , the dosage of Abi@@ li@@ fy should be raised to the dose height before the start of the accompanying therapy .
dil@@ ti@@ az@@ em or esc@@ ital@@ op@@ ram ) or C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 together with Abi@@ li@@ fy can be administered with a moderate increase in Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - concentrations .
in clinical trials , doses of 10 @-@ 30 mg of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed no significant effect on the metabolism of the medi@@ ums of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 ( dex@@ tro@@ met@@ orph@@ an / 3 @-@ metho@@ xy@@ morph@@ ine R@@ atio ) , 2@@ C@@ 19 ( O@@ me@@ pra@@ zo@@ l ) and 3@@ A4 ( dex@@ tro@@ met@@ orph@@ an ) .
patients should be advised to notify their doctor if they are pregnant or plan pregnant during treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole .
due to insufficient data security for human safety and the concerns raised in the reproductive studies during animal studies , this drug may not be used during pregnancy unless the potential benefits clearly justify the potential risk of fet@@ us .
however , as with other anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics , patients should be warned of using dangerous machines , including motor vehicles , until they are certain that Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole has no negative influence on it .
the following adverse events occurred more frequently ( ≥ 1 / 100 ) than placebo or were classified as possible medi@@ cally relevant side effects ( * ) :
the frequency of the side effects listed below is defined according to the following criteria : frequent ( &gt; 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) ; occasionally ( &gt; 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) .
schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia - In a controlled long @-@ term study of 52 weeks , patients who were treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole achieved a overall lower incidence ( 25.@@ 8 % ) of EPS including Park@@ in@@ son@@ ism , ac@@ ath@@ isie , D@@ yst@@ onia and Dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia , compared to patients treated with hal@@ operi@@ dol ( 5@@ 7.@@ 3 % ) .
in a placebo @-@ controlled long @-@ term study over 26 weeks , the incidence of EPS was 19 % in patients under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l and 13.@@ 1 % in patients under placebo .
in another controlled long @-@ term study over 26 weeks , the incidence of EPS 14.@@ 8 % in patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole was 15.@@ 1 % in patients under O@@ lan@@ z@@ ine therapy .
man@@ ic episodes in bi@@ polar @-@ I @-@ disorder - In a controlled trial over 12 weeks , the incidence of EPS 23.@@ 5 % in patients under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - treatment and 5@@ 3.3 % in patients under half @-@ surgery treatment .
in another study over 12 weeks , the incidence of EPS was 26.@@ 6 % in patients under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l and 17.@@ 6 % for those under lithium treatment .
during the long @-@ term maintenance phase over 26 weeks in a placebo @-@ controlled trial , the incidence of EPS 18.@@ 2 % for patients under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - Treatment and 15.@@ 7 % for patients treated with placebo .
a comparison between the patient groups under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l and placebo in which potentially clin@@ ically significant changes of rout@@ inely controlled laboratory parameters did not result in medi@@ cally significant differences .
enh@@ ancements of CP@@ K ( cre@@ atine ph@@ osp@@ ho@@ kin@@ ase ) , generally temporary and asy@@ mpt@@ om@@ atic , were observed at 3.5 % of patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , compared to 2.0 % of patients treated with placebo .
side effects that may occur in connection with an anti@@ psych@@ otic therapy and whose incidence also relates to treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole include the malign@@ ant neuro@@ le@@ p@@ tic syndrome , late dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia and sei@@ zur@@ es , un@@ desirable cereb@@ rov@@ ascular events and increased mortality in older dementia patients , hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia and diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus ( see section 4.4 ) .
in clinical studies and since the launch , un@@ intended or inten@@ tional acute over@@ doses with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole were observed in adult patients with estimated doses of up to 12@@ 60 mg and without death sequence .
there is no information about the efficacy of a hem@@ odi@@ aly@@ sis in the treatment of an over@@ dose with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole ; however , it is unlikely that hem@@ odi@@ aly@@ sis is beneficial in the treatment of over@@ dosage , as Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole has a high plasma protein binding .
it is thought that the efficacy of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder is medi@@ ated via the combination of a partial agon@@ istic effect on dop@@ amine D@@ 2- and ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 1@@ a- recept@@ ors and an antagon@@ istic effect on ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 2a recept@@ ors .
in vitro , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed a high aff@@ inity for dop@@ amine D@@ 2- and D@@ 3 receptor and ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 1@@ a and 5@@ HT@@ 2a receptor as well as a moderate aff@@ inity for dop@@ amine D@@ 4@@ - , ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 2@@ c@@ - and 5@@ HT@@ 7@@ - , to alpha @-@ 1 @-@ adren@@ er@@ gen and to hist@@ amine @-@ H@@ 1@@ recept@@ ors .
in dosage of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in doses ranging from 0.5 to 30 mg once daily for 2 weeks to healthy subjects , posit@@ ron emission tom@@ ography showed a dose @-@ dependent reduction in binding of 11@@ C Rac@@ lo@@ pri@@ d , a D2 / D@@ 3 receptor lig@@ ands , at Nu@@ cle@@ us cau@@ dat@@ us and at the put@@ name .
in three placebo @-@ controlled short @-@ term studies ( 4 to 6 weeks ) to 1,@@ 2@@ 28 schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ic patients with positive or negative symptoms , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l showed a statisti@@ cally significant improvement in the psych@@ otic symptoms compared to placebo .
in a hal@@ operi@@ dol @-@ controlled trial , 52 the proportion of respon@@ dents adher@@ ed to the study medication in week 52 was similar to both groups ( Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l 77 % and hal@@ operi@@ dol 73 % ) .
current values from measurement scales , which were defined as secondary study targets including P@@ AN@@ SS and the Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery @-@ As@@ sum@@ ption Scale , showed significantly greater improvement than at hal@@ operi@@ dol .
in a placebo @-@ controlled trial over 26 weeks of patients with chronic schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed a significantly higher incidence rate , which was 34 % in the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l group and 57 % placebo .
in an O@@ lan@@ zap@@ ine controlled , multinational double blind study for schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia over 26 weeks , which included 3@@ 14 patients and in which the primary study target was &apos; weight gain &apos; , significantly fewer patients had a weight gain of at least 7 % compared to the initial value ( i.e. an increase of at least 5,@@ 6 kg with an average weight of ca . ) .
in two placebo @-@ controlled mon@@ otherapy studies with flexible dosage over 3 weeks with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of bi@@ polar I disorder , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed a efficacy compared to placebo in reducing man@@ ic symptoms over 3 weeks .
in a placebo @-@ controlled mon@@ otherapy trial over 3 weeks with fixed dosage with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of bi@@ polar I disorder , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l showed no superior efficacy compared to placebo .
in two placebo and active @-@ controlled mon@@ otherapy studies over 12 weeks in patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of a bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , with or without psych@@ otic characteristics , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed a efficacy against placebo in week 3 and a maintenance effect comparable to that of lithium or hal@@ operi@@ dol in week 12 .
in addition , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole also showed a comparable share of patients with sympt@@ om@@ atic re@@ mission of the man@@ ia in week 12 , such as lithium or hal@@ operi@@ dol .
in a placebo @-@ controlled trial over 6 weeks with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of a bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , with or without psych@@ otic characteristics , which sometimes did not respond to lithium or val@@ pro@@ at mon@@ otherapy in therapeutic serum mirrors , the accompanying therapy with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l revealed a superior efficacy in reducing man@@ ic symptoms compared to mon@@ otherapy with lithium or val@@ pro@@ at .
10 In a placebo @-@ controlled trial over 26 weeks followed by a long @-@ term enlargement phase over 74 weeks in man@@ ic patients who had achieved re@@ mission with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l during a stabili@@ zation phase before random@@ isation , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole was superior to the prevention of a bi@@ polar decline , predominantly in the prevention of a rel@@ ap@@ se into the man@@ ia .
based on in vitro studies , the enzymes C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 and C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 are responsible for the de@@ hydr@@ ation and hydro@@ xy@@ regulation of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole ; N de@@ al@@ ky@@ lam@@ ation is cataly@@ sed by C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 .
the mean period of Eli@@ min@@ ation is approximately 75 hours for Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in extensive metabol@@ ites via C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 and at approximately 146 hours in &apos; poor &apos; ( = poor &quot; ) metabol@@ ites via C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 .
in Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole there are no differences in the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic between male and female healthy volunteers , as did pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic study of schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia patients with no gender @-@ dependent effects .
a specific evaluation of pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics did not reveal any evidence of clin@@ ically significant differences regarding ethnic origin or the effect of smoking on the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole .
the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic properties of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole and Deh@@ ydr@@ o @-@ Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole were similar in patients with severe kidney failure in comparison to young healthy subjects .
a single dose trial in subjects with different liver cir@@ rho@@ sis ( Child @-@ Pu@@ gh class A , B and C ) showed no significant effect regarding liver function on the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole and Deh@@ ydr@@ o @-@ Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , but the study included only 3 patients with cir@@ rho@@ sis of the class C , which is not enough to draw conclusions about their metabolic capacity .
based on conventional studies on safety har@@ mac@@ ology , toxic@@ ity in repeated administration , reproductive toxic@@ ity , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity and carcin@@ ogen@@ ic potential , pre @-@ clinical data did not reveal any particular dangers to humans .
toxic@@ ologically significant effects were observed only in dos@@ ages or ex@@ positions that clearly exceeded the maximum dose or exposure in humans , so they have limited or no meaning for clinical use .
the effects covered a dose @-@ dependent adren@@ al @-@ toxic@@ ity ( Li@@ po@@ f@@ us@@ cin @-@ pigment @-@ accumulation and / or par@@ ench@@ y@@ ma cell loss ) in rats after 104 weeks at the recommended maximum dose in humans ) and an increase of adren@@ al @-@ adren@@ al @-@ carcin@@ omas and combined adren@@ al @-@ adren@@ al @-@ aden@@ omas ( AU@@ C ) in female rats at the recommended maximum dose in humans ) .
in addition , a ch@@ ol@@ eli@@ thi@@ asis was detected as a result of the purification of sul@@ fate con@@ ju@@ gates of the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in the G@@ alle of apes after repeated oral administration of 25 to 125 mg / kg / day ( 1 to 3 times the recommended maximum dose in humans based on mg / m2 ) .
however , the concentrations of sulph@@ ate con@@ ju@@ gates of hydro@@ xy@@ - Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole found at the highest recommended daily dose of 30 mg were no more than 6 % of the concentrations found in the G@@ alle in monkeys and are far below limit values ( 6 % ) in vitro solu@@ bility .
in rab@@ bits , these effects were observed after dos@@ ages , which led to expos@@ ures of the 3 and 11 times the middle ste@@ ady state AU@@ C at the recommended clinical maximum dose .

15 late dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia : in clinical studies that lasted a year or less , there were occasional reports of dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia occurring during treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l .
it is thought that the efficacy of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder is medi@@ ated via the combination of a partial agon@@ istic effect on dop@@ amine D@@ 2- and ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 1@@ a- recept@@ ors and an antagon@@ istic effect on ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 2a recept@@ ors .

the recommended starting dose for Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole is 10 or 15 mg / day at a maintenance dose of 15 mg / day , once daily independently of meals .
patients who have difficulty swal@@ lowing of Abi@@ li@@ fy tablets can alternatively use the melting tablets at Abi@@ li@@ fy tablets ( see Section 5.2 ) .
the occurrence of su@@ ici@@ dal behavior belongs to psych@@ otic diseases and aff@@ ective disorders has been reported in some cases after on@@ set or after change of an anti@@ psych@@ otic therapy , also in treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) .
late dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia : in clinical studies that lasted a year or less , there were occasional reports of dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia occurring during treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l .
clinical manifestations of a M@@ NS are high fever , muscular rigi@@ dity , changing levels of consciousness and signs of autonomous inst@@ ability ( irregular pulse or blood pressure , t@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ dia , swe@@ ating and cardiac ar@@ rhyth@@ mia ) .
weight gain is generally observed in schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ic patients and in patients with bi@@ polar man@@ ia due to com@@ or@@ bi@@ di@@ ties , the use of anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics , in which weight gain is known as a side effect or an un@@ healthy lifestyle and might lead to serious complications .

it is thought that the efficacy of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder is medi@@ ated via the combination of a partial agon@@ istic effect on dop@@ amine D@@ 2- and ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 1@@ a- recept@@ ors and an antagon@@ istic effect on ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 2a recept@@ ors .
in an O@@ lan@@ zap@@ ine controlled , multinational double blind study for schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia over 26 weeks , which included 3@@ 14 patients and in which the primary study target was &apos; weight gain &apos; , significantly fewer patients had a weight gain of at least 7 % compared to the initial value ( i.e. an increase of at least 5,@@ 6 kg with an average weight of ca . ) .
97 In a placebo @-@ controlled mon@@ otherapy trial over 3 weeks with fixed dosage with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of bi@@ polar I disorder , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l showed no superior efficacy compared to placebo .
in a relative bio@@ availability study , in which pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics were compared to 30 mg Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l in tablet form in healthy subjects , the ratio between the geometric C@@ max mean value of the solution and the value of the tablets was 122 % ( N = 30 ) .
99 Fur@@ ther@@ more , a ch@@ ol@@ eli@@ thi@@ asis was detected as a result of the purification of sul@@ fate con@@ ju@@ gates of the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in the G@@ alle of apes after repeated oral administration of 25 to 125 mg / kg / day ( 1 to 3 times the recommended maximum dose in humans based on mg / m2 ) .
in rab@@ bits , these effects were observed after dos@@ ages , which led to expos@@ ures of the 3 and 11 times the middle ste@@ ady state AU@@ C at the recommended clinical maximum dose .
Abi@@ li@@ fy injection solution is used for fast control of a@@ gi@@ ti@@ bility and behavi@@ our@@ al disorders in patients with schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia or in patients with man@@ ic episodes of bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder if oral therapy is not appropriate .
as soon as it is clin@@ ically appropriate , the treatment should be terminated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l injection solution and commen@@ ced with oral application of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole .
in order to increase the res@@ or@@ ption and minimize vari@@ ability , an injection is recommended in the M. del@@ to@@ ide@@ us or deep into the glut@@ eus @-@ maxim@@ us muscle while re@@ covering adi@@ p@@ ous regions .
a lower dose of 5.@@ 25 mg ( 0.@@ 7 ml ) may be given depending on the individual clinical status given to the medicines used for maintenance or acute therapy ( see Section 4.5 ) .
if a secondary oral treatment is indicated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , see the summary of the characteristics of the medication to Abi@@ li@@ fy tablets , Abi@@ li@@ fy melting tablets or abili@@ fy solution .
there are no studies on the efficacy of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole injection solution in patients with a@@ gi@@ ti@@ bility and behavi@@ our@@ al disorders caused by schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia and man@@ ic episodes of bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder .
if par@@ enter@@ al therapy with ben@@ zo@@ di@@ az@@ ep@@ ines is considered necessary in addition to the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole injection solution , patients should be observed with respect to extreme se@@ dation or blood pressure drop ( see Section 4.5 ) .
tests on the safety and efficacy of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole injection solution are not available for patients with alcohol or drug pois@@ oning ( prescribed by prescribed or illegal drugs ) .
Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole should be used with care in patients with known cardiovascular disease ( m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction or isch@@ em@@ ic heart disease , heart failure , over@@ current disorders ) , cereb@@ rov@@ ascular diseases , conditions that pre@@ dispose for hyp@@ ot@@ onia ( de@@ hydr@@ ation , hypo@@ vol@@ a@@ emia , treatment with blood pressure lowering drugs ) or hypertension ( including ac@@ o@@ cel@@ eri@@ zed and malign@@ ant form ) .
late dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia : in clinical studies that lasted a year or less , there were occasional reports of dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia occurring during treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l .
clinical manifestations of a M@@ NS are high fever , muscle stiff@@ ness , changing levels of consciousness and signs of autonomous inst@@ ability ( irregular pulse or blood pressure , t@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ dia , swe@@ ating and cardiac ar@@ rhyth@@ mia ) .
poly@@ di@@ p@@ sy , poly@@ ur@@ ie , pol@@ yp@@ ha@@ gia and weakness ) are observed and patients with diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus or with risk factors for diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus should be monitored regularly in relation to a deterioration of glucose levels .
weight gain is generally observed in schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ic patients and patients with bi@@ polar man@@ ia due to com@@ or@@ bi@@ di@@ ties , the use of anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics , in which weight gain is known as a side effect or an un@@ healthy lifestyle and might lead to serious complications .
nevertheless , the intensity of the se@@ dation was greater compared to the one given by Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l , in a study where healthy subjects were administered intra@@ muscular as one @-@ time indication and who received at the same time Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am ( 2 mg dose ) intra@@ muscular .
105 The H@@ 2 antagon@@ ist fam@@ oti@@ dine , a ga@@ stri@@ c acid blo@@ cker , reduces the res@@ or@@ ption of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , but this effect is considered clin@@ ically not relevant .

other highly effective inhibit@@ ors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , such as I@@ tra@@ con@@ az@@ ole and HI@@ V@@ - prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , are likely to have similar effects and therefore similar dos@@ ages should be made .
after placing the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 or 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ or , the dosage of Abi@@ li@@ fy should be raised to the dose height before the start of the accompanying therapy .
106 Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am ( 2 mg dose ) intra@@ muscular received , the intensity of the se@@ dation was greater compared to that of all@@ u@@ vial administration of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole .
the following adverse events occurred more frequently in clinical trials with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l injection solution ( ≥ 1 / 100 ) than placebo or were classified as possible medi@@ cally relevant side effects ( see Section 5.1 ) :
the frequency of the side effects listed below is defined according to the following criteria : frequent ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) ; occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) .
the following adverse events occurred more frequently ( ≥ 1 / 100 ) than placebo or were classified as medi@@ cally relevant side effects ( * ) in clinical trials ( see Section 5.1 ) :
in a placebo @-@ controlled long @-@ term study over 26 weeks , the incidence of EPS was 19 % in patients under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - treatment and 13.@@ 1 % in patients under placebo .
in another study over 12 weeks , the incidence of EPS was 26.@@ 6 % in patients under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - treatment and 17.@@ 6 % for those under lithium treatment .
during the long @-@ term maintenance phase over 26 weeks in a placebo @-@ controlled trial , the incidence of EPS 18.@@ 2 % for patients under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l was treated and 15.@@ 7 % for patients treated with placebo .
a comparison between the patient groups under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l and placebo in which potentially clin@@ ically significant changes of rout@@ inely controlled laboratory parameters did not result in medi@@ cally significant differences .
enh@@ ancements of CP@@ K ( cre@@ at@@ in@@ ph@@ osp@@ ho@@ kin@@ ase ) , generally temporary and asy@@ mpt@@ om@@ atic , were observed at 3.5 % of patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , compared to 2.0 % of patients treated with placebo .
side effects that may occur in connection with an anti@@ psych@@ otic therapy and whose incidence also relates to treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole include the malign@@ ant neuro@@ le@@ p@@ tic syndrome , late dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia and sei@@ zur@@ es , un@@ desirable cereb@@ rov@@ ascular events and increased mortality in older dementia patients , hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia and diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus ( see section 4.4 ) .
110 and behavi@@ our@@ al disorders were the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l injection solution combined with statisti@@ cally significant enh@@ ancements of a@@ gi@@ ti@@ bility / behavi@@ our@@ al disorders compared to placebo and was similar to hal@@ operi@@ dol .
in a placebo @-@ controlled short @-@ term study ( 24 h ) with 29@@ 1 patients with bi@@ polar disorder as well as a@@ gi@@ ti@@ bility and behavi@@ our@@ al disorders , the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l injection solution was associated with a statisti@@ cally significant improvement in the symptoms of a@@ gi@@ ti@@ bility and behavi@@ our@@ al disorders compared to placebo and similar to the Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am@@ - reference poor .
the observed average improvement from bas@@ eline to the P@@ AN@@ SS Ex@@ cit@@ ement Compon@@ ent score for the primary 2 @-@ hour end@@ point was 5,@@ 8 for placebo , 9.@@ 6 for Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am and 8.@@ 7 for Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole .
in analyses of sub@@ groups in patients with mixed episodes or patients with severe a@@ toxic@@ ity , a similar efficacy was observed in relation to the overall population , but a statistical significance could be determined on the basis of a reduced number of patients .
in three placebo @-@ controlled short @-@ term studies ( 4 to 6 weeks ) to 1,@@ 2@@ 28 schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ic patients with positive or negative symptoms , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l ( oral ) showed a statisti@@ cally significant improvement in the psych@@ otic symptoms compared to placebo .
in a hal@@ operi@@ dol @-@ controlled trial , 52 the proportion of respon@@ dents adher@@ ed to the study medication in week 52 was similar to both groups ( Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l 77 % ( oral ) and hal@@ operi@@ dol 73 % ) .
current values from measurement scales , which were defined as secondary study targets including P@@ AN@@ SS and the Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery @-@ As@@ berg Method of Depres@@ sions , showed a significantly greater improvement than at Hal@@ operi@@ dol .
in a placebo @-@ controlled trial over 26 weeks of patients with chronic schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole ( oral ) showed significantly higher incidence of rel@@ ap@@ se , which was 34 % in the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ ar ( oral ) group and 57 % placebo .
in an O@@ lan@@ zap@@ ine controlled , multinational double blind study for schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia over 26 weeks , which included 3@@ 14 patients and in which the primary study target was &apos; weight gain &apos; , significantly fewer patients had a weight gain of at least 7 % compared to the initial value ( i.e. an increase of at least 5,@@ 6 kg with an average weight of ca . ) .
111 In a placebo @-@ controlled study for 6 weeks with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of a bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , with or without psych@@ otic characteristics , which sometimes did not respond to lithium or val@@ pro@@ at mon@@ otherapy in therapeutic serum mirrors , the adju@@ v@@ ant therapy with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l revealed a superior efficacy in reducing man@@ ic symptoms compared to mon@@ otherapy with lithium or val@@ pro@@ at .
in a placebo @-@ controlled trial over 26 weeks followed by a 74 @-@ week study extension for man@@ ic patients who had achieved re@@ mission with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l during a stabili@@ zation phase before random@@ isation , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l was superior to the prevention of a bi@@ polar decline , predominantly in the prevention of a return to the man@@ ia .
the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole AU@@ C is 90 % larger in the first 2 hours after intra@@ muscular injection after administration of the same dose as tablet ; systemic exposure was similar between the two form@@ ulations .
in 2 studies with healthy volunteers the average time was to reach the maximum plasma level at 1 to 3 hours after application .
the gift of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole injection solution was well tolerated by rats and monkeys and resulted in no direct toxic@@ ity of a target organ after repeated application in systemic exposure ( AU@@ C ) , which was 15@@ - or 5 times over the maximum human@@ istic exposure of 30 mg intra@@ muscular .
in studies for reproductive toxic@@ ity after IV application , no safety @-@ relevant concerns after mat@@ ernal exposure to 15@@ - ( rats ) and 29 times ( rab@@ bits ) were above the maximum human@@ istic exposure of 30 mg .
based on conventional studies with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole ( oral ) for safety har@@ mac@@ ology , toxic@@ ity in repeated administration , reproductive toxic@@ ity , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity and carcin@@ ogen@@ ic potential , pre @-@ clinical data did not reveal any particular dangers to humans .
toxic@@ ologically significant effects were observed only in dos@@ ages or ex@@ positions , which significantly exceeded the maximum dosage or exposure to humans ; therefore , they have limited or no meaning for clinical use .
the effects covered a dose @-@ dependent adren@@ al @-@ toxic@@ ity ( Li@@ po@@ f@@ us@@ cin @-@ pigment @-@ accumulation and / or par@@ ench@@ y@@ ma cell loss ) in rats after 104 weeks at the recommended maximum dose in humans ) and an increase of adren@@ al cor@@ tex @-@ carcin@@ omas and combined adren@@ al @-@ glands in female rats at 60 mg / kg / day ( that is 10 times the average steady @-@ state exposure ( AU@@ C ) at the recommended maximum dose in humans ) .
in addition , a ch@@ ol@@ eli@@ thi@@ asis was detected as a result of the purification of sul@@ fate con@@ ju@@ gates of the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in the G@@ alle of apes after repeated oral administration of 25 to 125 mg / kg / day ( 1 to 3 times the recommended maximum dose in humans based on mg / m2 ) .
in rab@@ bits , these effects were observed after dos@@ ages , which led to ex@@ positions of the 3- and 11 @-@ fold middle steady @-@ state AU@@ C at the recommended clinical maximum dose .

the efficacy of Abra@@ x@@ ane was investigated in a major study involving 4@@ 60 women with metastatic breast cancer , of which about three @-@ quarters used to receive an anth@@ ra@@ cycl@@ ine .
the effect of Abra@@ x@@ ane ( in general or as mon@@ otherapy ) was compared with the medication containing a conventional pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el ( given in combination with other medicines to reduce side effects ) .
in the main study 72 ( 31 % ) of 2@@ 29 patients treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane were treated to the treatment , compared to 37 ( 16 % ) of 225 patients receiving conventional pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el .
if only the patients treated for metastatic breast cancer were treated for the first time , there was no difference in the effectiveness indicators such as time to wor@@ sen@@ ing of disease and survival .
on the other hand , patients who had previously received other treatment for their metastatic breast cancer showed that Abra@@ x@@ ane was more effective than conventional pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el .
it may also not be used in patients who have low neut@@ ro@@ ph@@ ils in the blood before or before the treatment .
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) found that Abra@@ x@@ ane was more effective than conventional pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el and that it did not have to be given with other medicines compared to other pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el medicines to reduce side effects .
in January 2008 , the European Commission granted the company Abra@@ xis Bio@@ Science Limited a permit for the transport of Abra@@ x@@ ane in the entire European Union .
Abra@@ x@@ ane @-@ mon@@ otherapy is indicated for the treatment of metastatic breast cancer in people in whom the first @-@ line treatment for metastatic disease has failed and for which a standard anth@@ ra@@ cycl@@ ine @-@ containing treatment is not indicated ( see also section 4.4 ) .
in patients with severe neut@@ rop@@ en@@ ia ( neut@@ ro@@ ph@@ inum number &lt; 0,@@ 50 x 109 / l over a period of one week or longer ) or severe sensory neu@@ rop@@ athy , the dose should be reduced to 220 mg / m2 in subsequent series .
for sensory neu@@ rop@@ athy grade 3 , the treatment should be interrupted until improvement is reached on degree 1 or 2 , and in all subsequent cycles , the dose must be reduced .
there are currently no adequate data for the recommendation of dosage adjustments in patients with mild to moderate liver function ( see Section 4.@@ 4. and 5.2 ) .
no studies were carried out with patients with impaired kidney function and there are currently no adequate data for the recommendation of dose adaptation in patients with impairment of the kidney function ( see Section 5.2 ) .
Abra@@ x@@ ane is not recommended for use in children under 18 years of age due to insufficient data on safety and effectiveness .
Abra@@ x@@ ane is an alb@@ um@@ in @-@ bound nan@@ op@@ article formulation of pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el , which could have much other pharmac@@ ological characteristics than other form@@ ulations of pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el ( see Section 5.1 and 5.2 ) .
if an allergic reaction occurs , the medicine should be removed immediately and a sympt@@ om@@ atic treatment should be initiated , and the patient may not be treated with pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el again .
in the patients no further Abra@@ x@@ ane treatment cycles should be initiated until the neut@@ ro@@ ph@@ rop@@ hic number has risen again to &gt; 1.5 x 109 / l and the th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ te number has risen again to &gt; 100 x 109 / l .
patients with severe liver dys@@ functions ( bili@@ ru@@ bin &gt; 5 x UL@@ N or AS@@ L / AL@@ T &gt; 10 x UL@@ N ) should not be treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane .
while a clearly associated cardi@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity was not proven in connection with Abra@@ x@@ ane , cardiac cases in the indicated patient population are not unusual , especially in patients with previous anth@@ ra@@ cycl@@ ine treatment or underlying heart or lung disease .
in the case of nausea , vom@@ iting and diar@@ rho@@ ea in patients after the application of Abra@@ x@@ ane , they can be treated with the usual anti@@ em@@ etic and con@@ sti@@ p@@ ating means .
Abra@@ x@@ ane should not be used in pregnant women or in child@@ bearing age , which do not practice effective contrac@@ eption , unless the treatment of the mother with pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el is unavoid@@ able .
women in child@@ bearing age should use a reliable contrac@@ ep@@ tive method during and up to 1 month after the treatment with Abra@@ x@@ ane .
male patients treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane are advised to bear no child during and up to six months after the treatment .
male patients should be advised prior to the treatment , because the therapy with Abra@@ x@@ ane is the possibility of ir@@ reversible in@@ fertility .
Abra@@ x@@ ane can cause side effects such as fatigue ( very common ) and di@@ zz@@ iness ( often ) , which can affect the per@@ spir@@ ation and ability to operate machines .
listed below are the most common and important events of side effects that occurred in 2@@ 29 patients with metastatic breast cancer who were treated once every three weeks with 260 mg / m2 of Abra@@ x@@ ane in the pi@@ vot@@ al phase III trial .
neut@@ rop@@ en@@ ia was the most con@@ spic@@ uous important hem@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity ( reported in 79 % of patients ) and was quickly reversible and dose @-@ dependent ; leu@@ kop@@ en@@ ia was reported to 71 % of patients .
an@@ emia ( H@@ b &lt; 10 g / dl ) was observed in 46 % of patients treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane and was severe in three cases ( H@@ b &lt; 8 g / dl ) .
table 1 contains the side effects that have occurred in combination with the dosage of Abra@@ x@@ ane as mon@@ otherapy at any dose and indication in studies ( N = 7@@ 89 ) .
very common ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) ; occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) ; rarely ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 , &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) ; very rare ( &lt; 1 / 10 ) .
occasionally , elevated blood pressure , weight gain , increased lac@@ tic hydro@@ gen@@ ase in the blood , increased cre@@ atine in the blood , increased blood sugar , increased phosph@@ or@@ us in the blood , reduced potassium in the blood of heart disease :

rest@@ lessness 1 The frequency of hyper@@ sensitivity reactions is calculated based on a definitive in relation to a population of 7@@ 89 patients
since these events were reported on a voluntary basis during clinical practice , no estimates of the actual incidence are possible and no caus@@ al connection with these events was established .
pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el is a stimul@@ i @-@ stimul@@ i substance that promotes the accumulation of mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ ules from the tu@@ b@@ ules and stabili@@ zes mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ ules by inhibit@@ ing their dep@@ oly@@ mer@@ isation .
this stabili@@ zation leads to in@@ hibition of the normal dynamic re@@ organisation of the mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ ular network , which is essential for the vital inter@@ phase and the mit@@ otic cell functions .
it is known that alb@@ um@@ in con@@ veys the trans@@ it@@ to@@ sis of plasma components into the endo@@ theli@@ al cells and in vitro studies it has been proven that the presence of alb@@ um@@ in supports the transport of pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el through the endo@@ theli@@ al cells .
it is assumed that this improved tran@@ sen@@ do@@ theli@@ al transport is medi@@ ated by the g@@ p @-@ 60 @-@ alb@@ um@@ receptor and a pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el accumulation in the area of the tumor occurs due to the alb@@ um@@ bin@@ ing protein SP@@ ARC ( secre@@ ted protein aci@@ dic rich in c@@ yst@@ eine ) .
the application of Abra@@ x@@ ane for metastatic breast cancer is supported by data from 106 patients in two single @-@ arm un@@ blin@@ ded studies and 4@@ 54 patients treated in a random@@ ized phase III comparative study .
in a study , 43 patients with metastatic breast carcin@@ oma were treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane , which was given in the form of an in@@ fusion for 30 minutes with a dose of 175 mg / m2 .
in the second study , a dose of 300 mg / m2 was used as in@@ fusion for 30 minutes to 63 patients with metastatic breast cancer .
this multi@@ center study was performed in patients with metastatic breast cancer who received treatment with pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el every 3 weeks either in the form of solvent containing Pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el 175 mg / m2 as 3 @-@ hour in@@ fusion with pre@@ medication to prevent allergic reaction ( N = 225 ) or in the form of Abra@@ x@@ ane 260 mg / m2 as 30 @-@ minute in@@ fusion without pre@@ medication ( N = 2@@ 29 ) .
in the study 64 % of patients had an impaired general condition ( ECO@@ G 1 or 2 ) , 79 % had vis@@ cer@@ al metast@@ ases and 76 % had more than 3 metast@@ asis .
14 % of patients had not received chemotherapy before , 27 % had only one adju@@ v@@ ant chemotherapy , 40 % only because of metast@@ asis and 19 % due to metast@@ asis and adju@@ v@@ ant treatment .
9 The results for the general response rate and time to progression of the disease as well as progression @-@ free survival and survival for patients receiving &gt; First Line therapy are presented below .
neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity compared to pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el was evaluated by the improvement of a degree for patients who experienced a peripheral neu@@ rop@@ athy grade 3 at a time during therapy .
the natural course of peripheral neu@@ rop@@ athy for ab@@ at@@ ement at bas@@ eline due to the cum@@ ulative toxic@@ ity of Abra@@ x@@ ane after &gt; 6 treatment courses was not evaluated and remains unknown .
the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of the total pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el after 30@@ - and 180 @-@ minute in@@ fu@@ sions of Abra@@ x@@ ane with a dose of 80 to 3@@ 75 mg / m2 were determined in clinical trials .
the exposure to active substance ( AU@@ C ) increased lin@@ early from 26@@ 53 to 16@@ 7@@ 36 n@@ g.@@ h / ml an@@ alog@@ ously to a dose of 80 to 300 mg / m2 .
10 After the intraven@@ ous administration of Abra@@ x@@ ane in patients with metastatic breast carcin@@ oma at the recommended clinical dose of 260 mg / m2 , the Pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el plasma concentration decreased in a multi@@ phase manner .
the average distribution volume was 6@@ 32 l / m2 ; the high distribution volume indicates far @-@ reaching extra@@ vascular distribution and / or soft tissue connection from pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el .
in a study with advanced solid tumours the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic properties of Pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el were compared with an intraven@@ ous 30 @-@ minute in@@ fusion of 260 mg / m2 of Abra@@ x@@ ane with the values after a 3 hour injection of 175 mg / m2 of solvent containing pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el .
after the Abra@@ x@@ ane administration , the Clear@@ ance of Pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el was higher ( 43 % ) than after a solvent containing pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el injection , and the distribution volume was higher ( 53 % ) at Abra@@ x@@ ane .
in the published literature on in @-@ vitro studies of human liver micro@@ some and tissue layers , it is reported that Pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el is met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed primarily to 6@@ α -@@ hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el and to two smaller metabol@@ ites ( 3 &quot; -@@ p @-@ hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el and 6@@ α -@@ 3 &quot; -@@ p @-@ D@@ ih@@ y@@ dro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el ) .
after a 30 @-@ minute in@@ fusion of 260 mg / m2 of Abra@@ x@@ ane in patients with metastatic breast carcin@@ oma , the mean value for cum@@ ulative ur@@ inary ex@@ cre@@ tion of the unchanged ingredient was 4 % of the given total dose of 6@@ α -@@ hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el and 3 &quot; -@@ p hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el , which indicates far @-@ reaching non @-@ ren@@ al clear@@ ance .
only a few data are available for patients at the age of more than 75 years , since only 3 patients of this age group participated in pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic analysis .
the chemical and physical stability was detected at 2 ° C - 8 ° C in original box and protected from light light over 8 hours .

this means that stre@@ amed is similar to a biological medicine approved in the European Union ( EU ) and contains the same active substance ( also called &quot; reference drug &quot; ) .
it is used in patients with normal blood glucose levels , where blood trans@@ fusion is not possible in connection with blood trans@@ fusion , and a blood loss of 900 to 1 800 ml can be expected .
the treatment with stre@@ amed must be initiated under the supervision of a physician who has experience in the treatment of patients with diseases for which the medicine is indicated .
in patients with kidney problems and in patients who want to make a blood donation , Ab@@ se@@ amed is inj@@ ected into a vein .
the injection can also be carried out by the patient or his super@@ visor , provided that they have received appropriate guidance .
in patients with chronic ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency or in patients receiving chemotherapy , the hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in values should always be in the recommended range ( between 10 and 12 grams per dec@@ il@@ iter in adults or between 9.5 and 11 g / dl in children ) .
the iron values of all patients are to be checked before treatment to ensure that there is no iron deficiency , and iron supplements should be administered throughout the treatment .
in patients receiving chemotherapy , or in patients with kidney problems , an@@ a@@ emia can be caused by an er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ i@@ etal defect or by the fact that the body does not adequately address the body &apos;s er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ ie@@ tin .
er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ ie@@ tin is also used before surgery to increase the number of red blood cells and to decrease the consequences of blood loss .
it is produced by a cell in which a gene ( DNA ) was introduced that enables it to form epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa .
stre@@ amed was compared with the reference medicinal product when inj@@ ected into a vein as part of a main study involving 4@@ 79 patients suffering from kidney problems caused by kidney problems .
all patients participating in this study had been inj@@ ected into a vein for at least eight weeks before they were either converted to se@@ amed or continued to receive E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o .
the main indicator of efficacy was the change in ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in values between the beginning of the study and the assessment period in weeks 25 to 29 .
the company also presented the results of a study in which the effects of stre@@ amed from under the skin were studied with those of E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o in 114 cancer patients receiving chemotherapy .
in the study with patients suffering from an@@ a@@ emia caused by kidney problems , the ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in values of patients who were converted to se@@ amed were in the same measure as those patients who continued to receive E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o .
in comparison , the patients who continued to receive E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o showed an increase of 0,@@ 0@@ 63 g / dl of the initial value of 12.@@ 0 g / dl .
the most common side effect of ab@@ se@@ amed is an increase in blood pressure , which can occasionally lead to symptoms of en@@ cephal@@ opathy ( brain problems ) such as sudden , pier@@ cing mig@@ raine head@@ aches and confusion .
stre@@ amed may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa or any of the other ingredients .
stre@@ amed as inj@@ ections under the skin is not recommended for the treatment of kidney problems as further studies are required to ensure that this does not trigger allergic reactions .
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that for Ab@@ se@@ amed in accordance with the regulations of the European Union , evidence has been provided that the medicine has a comparable quality , safety and efficacy profile such as E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o .
the company that produces stre@@ amed will provide information packages for medical professionals in all Member States , including information on the safety of the drug .
in August 2007 , the European Commission issued approval for the company Medi@@ ce Pharmac@@ eutical P@@ üt@@ ter GmbH &amp; Co . kg for the placing of dis@@ approval throughout the European Union .
treatment of an@@ a@@ emia and reduction of trans@@ fusion demand in adults with solid tumours , malign@@ ant lymph@@ omas or multiple my@@ el@@ oma , which receive chemotherapy and in which the risk of trans@@ fusion is due to the general condition ( such as cardiovascular condition , pre @-@ existing an@@ a@@ emia at the beginning of chemotherapy ) .
treatment should only be performed in patients with moderate an@@ a@@ emia ( ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in &#91; h@@ b &#93; 10 - 13 g / dl &#91; 6,@@ 2 - 8,@@ 1 m@@ mo@@ l / l &#93; , if bleeding @-@ saving measures are not available or insufficient , in case of planned larger surgical procedures requiring a large volume of blood ( 4 or more units blood for women ; 5 or more units blood in men ) .
to reduce foreign blood , ab@@ se@@ amed can be used before large elec@@ tive orthop@@ a@@ edic surgery in adults without iron deficiency , in which a high risk of trans@@ fusion complications can be expected .
H@@ B 10 @-@ 13 g / dl ) and an expected blood loss of 900 @-@ 1800 ml , which cannot participate in a aut@@ olog@@ ous blood donation program .
the hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in target concentration is between 10 and 12 g / dl ( 6.2 - 7.5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) except for pedi@@ atric patients where the hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in concentration should lie between 9,5 and 11 g / dl ( 5.@@ 9 - 6.@@ 8 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
symptoms and symptoms can vary depending on age , gender and overall disease ; therefore , the physician &apos;s assessment of the individual clinical course and condition of the disease is necessary .
an increase in ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in by more than 2 g / dl ( 1.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) over a period of four weeks should be avoided .
due to the vari@@ ability between patients , individual hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in values can occasionally be observed in a patient above or below the hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in target concentration .
in view of this hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in vari@@ ability , a corresponding dose management should be tried to achieve the hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in target concentration of 10 g / dl ( 6.2 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) to 12 g / dl ( 7.5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
if the ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in value increases by more than 2 g / dl ( 1.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month or if the permanent hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in value exceeds 12 g / dl ( 7.5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) , the epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa dose can be reduced by 25 % .
patients should be closely monitored to ensure that epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is applied in the lowest permitted dose needed to control an@@ a@@ emia and an@@ emia .
these clinical results indicate that patients with very low H@@ b value ( &lt; 6 g / dl or &lt; 3,@@ 75 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) may require higher maintenance doses than patients where initial an@@ a@@ emia is less pronounced ( H@@ b &gt; 8 g / dl or &gt; 5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
these clinical results indicate that patients with very low H@@ b value ( &lt; 6.@@ 8 g / dl or &lt; 4.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) may require higher maintenance doses than patients where initial an@@ a@@ emia is less difficult ( H@@ b &gt; 6,@@ 8 g / dl or &gt; 4.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
starting dose 50 I.@@ U. / kg three times a week with intraven@@ ous application , if necessary with a dose increase of 25 I.@@ U. / kg ( three times a week ) until the desired target value is reached ( this should be done in steps of at least 4 weeks ) .
symptoms of an@@ a@@ emia and sequ@@ el@@ ae may vary depending on age , gender and overall disease ; therefore , the assessment of the individual clinical course and condition of the disease is required by the physician .
in view of this hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in vari@@ ability , a corresponding dose management should be tried to achieve the hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in target concentration of 10 g / dl ( 6.2 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) to 12 g / dl ( 7.5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
patients should be closely monitored to ensure that epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is applied in the lowest permitted dose required for control of an@@ em@@ ic symptoms .
if the ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in value is increased by at least 1 g / dl ( 0.@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) after 4 weeks of treatment , the dose of 150 I.@@ U. / kg should be maintained three times a week or 450 I.@@ U. / kg once a week .
if the increase in ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in &lt; 1 g / dl ( &lt; 0.@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and the multi@@ cy@@ te figure of &lt; 40,000 cells / µ@@ l is increased compared to the initial value , the dose should be increased to 300 I.@@ U. / kg three times a week .

if the ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in value is increased by &lt; 1 g / dl ( &lt; 0.@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) or the Re@@ tik@@ u@@ lo@@ cy@@ te number by &lt; 40,000 cells / µ@@ l compared to the initial value , a response to the epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa therapy is unlikely and the treatment should be stopped .
patients with slight an@@ a@@ emia ( ha@@ em@@ ato@@ cri@@ t 33 - 39 % ) , where the precau@@ tionary storage of ≥ 4 blood vessels is necessary , should be received twice weekly for 3 weeks before surgery .
iron sub@@ stitution should start as early as possible - for example a few weeks before the start of the aut@@ olog@@ ous blood donation program - to make large iron reserves available before the start of the stre@@ amed programme .
6 The recommended dosage is 600 I.@@ U. / kg Ep@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa which should be given once a week for three weeks ( day 21 , 14 and 7 ) before surgery and on the day of surgery ( day 0 ) .
epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa pre@@ oper@@ atively should be pre@@ oper@@ atively 300 I.@@ U. / kg each in 10 consecutive days , on the day of intervention and 4 days immediately afterwards .
alternatively , the injection at the end of di@@ aly@@ sis can be given over the hose of a fi@@ st@@ ula needle , followed by 10 ml is@@ ot@@ onic sal@@ ine solution to rinse the hose and ensure sufficient injection of the medicine into the circulation .
patients suffering from er@@ y@@ thro@@ bla@@ sto@@ op@@ ia ( Pure Red Cell A@@ pl@@ asia , PR@@ CA ) should not receive an ab@@ se@@ amed or other er@@ y@@ thro@@ bla@@ sto@@ op@@ ia ( see section 4.4 - er@@ y@@ thro@@ bla@@ sto@@ op@@ ia ) .
heart attack or stroke within one month prior to treatment , unstable ang@@ ina pec@@ tor@@ is , increased risk of deep ven@@ ous thro@@ mb@@ oses ( e.g. an@@ am@@ n@@ estic known ven@@ ous th@@ rom@@ bo@@ em@@ bo@@ lia ) .
the use of epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is contra@@ indicated in patients who are not eligible for a major orthop@@ a@@ edic surgery : severe cor@@ on@@ ary heart disease , peripheral vascular disease , vascular disease of the car@@ oti@@ des or cereb@@ rov@@ ascular disease ; in patients with recently occurred cardiac inf@@ ar@@ ction or cereb@@ rov@@ ascular event .
er@@ y@@ thro@@ bla@@ sto@@ y ( PR@@ CA ) Very rare was reported on the occurrence of an anti @-@ body medi@@ ated PR@@ CA after months of treatment with sub@@ cut@@ aneous er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ ie@@ tin .
in patients with sudden loss of time , defined as reduction of ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in values ( 1 - 2 g / dl per month ) with increased need for trans@@ fu@@ sions , the Re@@ tik@@ u@@ lo@@ zy@@ ten@@ ess should be determined and the usual causes for non @-@ response ( iron , fo@@ lic acid or vitamin B@@ 12 deficiency , aluminium lumin@@ ous toxic@@ ation , infections or inflammation , blood loss and ha@@ em@@ oly@@ sis ) .
if the Re@@ tik@@ u@@ lo@@ cy@@ te value , taking into account an@@ a@@ emia ( i.e. the Re@@ tik@@ u@@ lo@@ cytes &quot; Index &quot; ) , is degra@@ ded ( &lt; 20.000 / mm@@ 3 or &lt; 20,000 / micro@@ liter or &lt; 0.5 % ) , the th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ te and leu@@ ko@@ cy@@ te numbers should be determined and an investigation of the bone mar@@ row in the diagnosis of a PR@@ CA should be considered .
data on immun@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity in sub@@ cut@@ aneous use of ab@@ se@@ amed in patients with a risk for an anti @-@ body @-@ induced PR@@ CA ( patients with ren@@ al an@@ emia ) are not sufficient .
8 In patients with chronic kidney failure , maintenance therapy should not exceed the upper limit for hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in target concentration under Section 4.2 .
in clinical studies an increased risk of mortality and risk of serious cardiovascular events were observed when er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ esis @-@ stimulating agents ( ESA ) were given with a ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in target concentration of more than 12 g / dl ( 7.5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
controlled clinical studies have shown no significant benefit to the use of epo@@ et@@ ins if the ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in concentration is increased by the concentration required to control an@@ a@@ emia and the prevention of blood trans@@ fu@@ sions .
the increase in ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in should be about 1 g / dl ( 0.@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month and should not exceed 2 g / dl ( 1.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month to minimize the risk of high blood pressure .
in patients with chronic kidney failure and clin@@ ically clear cor@@ on@@ ary heart disease or con@@ ges@@ tive heart failure , maintenance therapy should not exceed the upper limit for hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in target concentration under Section 4.2 .
according to the present findings , the treatment of an@@ a@@ emia with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa in adults with ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency , which are not yet di@@ aly@@ sis , will not accelerate the progression of ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency .
tumour patients under chemotherapy should be considered a 2 @-@ 3 @-@ week delay between epo@@ e@@ tin @-@ al@@ fa and the er@@ y@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin response ( patients who may need to be trans@@ f@@ used ) .
if the increase in H@@ b exceeds 2 g / dl ( 1.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month or a H@@ b value of 13 g / dl ( 8,@@ 1 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) , the dose must be adapted according to section 4.2 , in order to minimize the risk of possible th@@ rom@@ bot@@ ic events ( see section 4.2 Treatment of patients with chem@@ o@@ therap@@ ic an@@ emia - dose adaptation with the aim of keeping the ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in value between 10 g / dl and 12 g / dl ) .
the decision for the use of re@@ combin@@ ant er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ et@@ ine should be based on a benefit @-@ risk assessment involving the involvement of the respective patient , which should also take into account the specific clinical context .
patients who are fores@@ een for greater elec@@ tive orthop@@ a@@ edic surgery should , if possible , examine the cause of an@@ a@@ emia before the beginning of epo@@ e@@ tin @-@ al@@ fa therapy and be treated accordingly .
patients who undergo a larger elec@@ tive orthop@@ a@@ edic surgery should receive adequate thro@@ mb@@ os@@ e@@ pro@@ phyla@@ xis , as they have an increased risk of th@@ rom@@ bot@@ ic and vascular diseases , especially in the case of underlying cardiovascular disease .
in addition , it cannot be ruled out that for treatment with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa for patients with an initial ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in value of &gt; 13 g / dl an increased risk of post @-@ operative / vascular events can exist .
in several controlled trials , epo@@ et@@ ins have not been proven to improve overall survival in tumour patients with sympt@@ om@@ atic an@@ a@@ emia , or reduce the risk of tumour progression .
4 months in patients with metastatic breast cancer receiving chemotherapy , when a hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in target concentration of 12 - 14 g / dl ( 7.5 - 8,@@ 7 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) was targeted
if epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is used together with C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in , the blood levels of C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in should be controlled and the C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in@@ dosis should be adjusted to the increasing ha@@ em@@ ato@@ cri@@ t .
in vitro studies on tumor tissues , there is no evidence of an interaction between epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa and G @-@ CS@@ F or GM @-@ CS@@ F in hem@@ at@@ ological differentiation or proliferation .
about th@@ rom@@ bot@@ ic , vascular events like m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial i@@ dem@@ a , m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction , cereb@@ rov@@ ascular accidents ( cereb@@ ral ha@@ em@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ ge , cereb@@ ral inf@@ ar@@ ction ) , arter@@ ial th@@ rom@@ bo@@ sis , pul@@ mon@@ ary th@@ rom@@ bo@@ sis , an@@ eur@@ ys@@ m , retin@@ ol thro@@ mb@@ oses , and 11 blood cl@@ ots in artificial kidneys was reported in patients under Er@@ y@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin @-@ treatment , as well as patients under epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa .
the most common side effect during treatment with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is a dose @-@ dependent increase in blood pressure or the deterioration of an existing hypertension .
increased incidence of th@@ rom@@ bo@@ vascular events ( see section 4.4 and Section 4.@@ 8 - General ) was observed in patients under er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ et@@ ine treatment .
independent of er@@ y@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin @-@ treatment , there may be th@@ rom@@ bot@@ ic and vascular complications in surgical patients with cardiovascular disease following repeated blood donations .
the genetically modified epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is gly@@ co@@ si@@ ulated and identical to the amino acids and the carbohydr@@ ate content with the endo@@ genous human er@@ y@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin isolated from the urine of infected patients .
it could be demonstrated with the help of cultures of human bone mar@@ row cells that epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa specifically stimulates the er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ esis and does not influence leu@@ kop@@ o@@ esis .
3@@ 89 patients with hem@@ o@@ bla@@ st@@ osis ( 2@@ 21 multiple my@@ el@@ oma , 144 non @-@ Ho@@ dg@@ kin &apos;s lymph@@ oma and 24 other hem@@ o@@ blast cells ) and 3@@ 32 patients with solid tumours ( 172 breast carcin@@ omas , 22 prostate carcin@@ omas , 21 gastro@@ intestinal carcin@@ omas , and 30 others ) .

survival and tumour progression were studied in five major controlled trials with a total of 28@@ 33 patients ; four of these studies were double blind placebo @-@ controlled trials and
in the open study there was no difference in overall survival between patients treated with re@@ combin@@ ant human er@@ y@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin and patients .
in these studies , patients with re@@ combin@@ ant human er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ ie@@ tin showed consistently an un@@ explained , statisti@@ cally significant higher mortality rate compared to controls in patients with re@@ combin@@ ant human er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ ie@@ tin .
overall survival in the studies could not be explained by differences in the incidence of thro@@ mb@@ oses and related complications in patients treated with re@@ combin@@ ant human er@@ y@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin and in inspections .
there is an increased risk of th@@ rom@@ bo@@ em@@ bo@@ lic events in tumour patients treated with re@@ combin@@ ant human er@@ y@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin , and a negative effect on overall survival cannot be ruled out .
it is not clear how far these results are applied to the application of re@@ combin@@ ant human er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ ie@@ tin in tumour patients who are treated with chemotherapy with the aim of achieving a hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in value below 13 g / dl , as too few patients with these characteristics were included in the checked data .
epo@@ e@@ tin @-@ al@@ fa @-@ determin@@ ations after repeated intraven@@ ous application showed a half @-@ life of approximately 4 hours in healthy volunteers and a somewhat prolonged half @-@ life of approximately 5 hours in patients with ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency .
after sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection , epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa serum levels are much lower than serum levels achieved after intraven@@ ous injection .
there is no Kum@@ ulation : the serum levels remain the same regardless of whether they are determined 24 hours after the first gift or 24 hours after the last gift .
bone mar@@ sh@@ al fibro@@ sis is a known complic@@ ation of chronic ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency in humans and could be attributed to secondary hyper@@ par@@ ath@@ y@@ re@@ oi@@ dis@@ m or unknown factors .
in a study of hem@@ odi@@ aly@@ sis patients who were treated with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa for three years , the incidence of bone mar@@ sh@@ al fibro@@ sis was not increased compared to the control group with di@@ aly@@ sis patients who were not treated with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa .
14 In animal experimental studies with approximately 20@@ x of recommended weekly dose , epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa led to a reduced federal body weight , a delay of the oscill@@ ation and an increase in fet@@ al mortality .
these reports are based on in vitro findings with cells from human tumour tissue samples , which are of uncertain significance for the clinical situation .

134 In animal studies with approximately 20@@ fold the recommended weekly dose , epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa led to a reduced federal body weight , to a delay of the oscill@@ ation and to an increase in fet@@ al mortality .
as part of the out@@ patient application , the patient can store Ab@@ se@@ amed once for a maximum of 3 days outside the refrigerator and not over 25 ° C .
141 The recommended dosage is 600 I.@@ U. / kg of epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa which should be given once a week for three weeks ( day 21 , 14 and 7 ) before surgery and on the day of intervention ( day 0 ) .
143 In patients with chronic kidney failure , maintenance therapy should not exceed the upper limit for hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in target concentration under Section 4.2 .
the increase in ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in should be about 1 g / dl ( 0.@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month and should not exceed 2 g / dl ( 1.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month to minimize the risk of high blood pressure .

prior to the market launch and in accordance with the agreement with the relevant authorities of the member states , the holder of approval for placing on the market has to provide medical personnel in di@@ aly@@ sis centres and retail stores with the following information and materials : • training brochure • Sum@@ mary of the characteristics of the drug ( specialist information ) , labelling and packaging inserts .
the holder of approval for the placing on the market has to ensure that the pharmaceutical vig@@ il@@ ance system described in Version 3.0 is set up and functioning in Module 1.@@ 8.@@ 1. of the authorisation application before the medicine is brought into circulation and as long as the medicine applied to the transport is applied .
the holder of the approval for the placing on the market comm@@ its to the Risk Management Plan ( R@@ MP ) listed in the pharmac@@ o@@ vig@@ il@@ ance plan as well as in version 5 of the Risk Management Plan ( R@@ MP ) listed in Module 1.@@ 8.@@ 2. of the authorisation application as well as any subsequent update of the Risk Management Plan adopted by the CH@@ MP .
according to the CH@@ MP Gui@@ deline on Risk Management Systems for medicinal products for human use , an updated RA should be provided with the next updated report on the safety of the drug ( Peri@@ odi@@ c Safety Update Report , P@@ SU@@ R ) .
in addition , an updated RA should be submitted : • When receiving new information that may have an impact on current safety specifications ( Safety Speci@@ fication ) , Pharmac@@ o@@ vig@@ il@@ ance Plan or risk reduction measures within 60 days of reaching an important ( the Pharmac@@ o@@ vig@@ il@@ ance or Risk Assessment ) mil@@ estones • Ac@@ cor@@ ding to the E@@ MEA
• If you suffer from a heart attack or stroke in a month prior to your treatment , if you suffer from unstable ang@@ ina pec@@ tor@@ is ( for the first time or increased chest pain ) , there is a risk of blood cl@@ ot@@ ting in the veins ( deep ven@@ ous thro@@ mb@@ oses ) - if for example , such a blood cl@@ ot@@ ting occurred earlier .
you suffer from severe disturbances of the heart ( cor@@ on@@ ary heart disease ) , the arter@@ ies of the legs or arms ( peripheral arter@@ ial oc@@ clu@@ sion ) , the cervi@@ cal vessels ( vascular disease of the car@@ oti@@ des ) or the brain ( cereb@@ rov@@ ascular disease ) recently suffered a heart attack or stroke .
during the treatment with ab@@ se@@ amed it can occur within the normal range to a slight dose @-@ dependent increase in the number of plat@@ el@@ ets , which again forms with further treatment .
your doctor will perform regular blood tests to check the number of plat@@ el@@ ets regularly during the first 8 weeks of treatment .
iron deficiency , dissolution of the red blood cells ( ha@@ em@@ oly@@ sis ) , blood loss , vitamin B@@ 12 or fo@@ lic acid deficiency , should be considered and treated before beginning treatment with ab@@ se@@ amed .
very rare was reported on the occurrence of an anti @-@ body er@@ y@@ thro@@ bla@@ sto@@ cy@@ st after mon@@ e@@ - until years of treatment with sub@@ cut@@ aneous ( under the skin ) er@@ y@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin .
if you suffer from er@@ y@@ thro@@ bla@@ sto@@ sis , it will dis@@ rupt your treatment with Ab@@ se@@ amed and determine how your an@@ emia is best treated .
therefore , secre@@ tion must be given by injection into a vein ( intraven@@ ously ) if you are treated for an@@ a@@ emia due to kidney disease .
a high ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in value could be the risk of problems with the heart or the blood vessels and the risk of death could be increased .
in case of hei@@ gh@@ tened or rising potassium levels , your doctor may take into consideration an interruption of the treatment with Ab@@ se@@ amed until the potassium levels are again in the normal range .
if you suffer from chronic ren@@ al weakness and clin@@ ically obvious cor@@ on@@ ary heart disease or con@@ ges@@ tion sign due to insufficient heart rate , your doctor will ensure that your hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in mirror does not exceed a certain value .
according to the present findings , the treatment of an@@ a@@ emia with ab@@ se@@ amed in adults with chronic kidney failure ( ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency ) , which are not yet di@@ aly@@ sis , will not accelerate the progression of ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency .
a 2 - 3 @-@ week delay between epo@@ e@@ tin @-@ al@@ fa @-@ gift and the desired effect should be considered for ass@@ essing the efficacy of Ab@@ se@@ amed .
200 your doctor will regularly determine your values of the red blood dy@@ e ( ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in ) and adjust your stre@@ amed dose accordingly to minimize the risk of blood cl@@ ots ( th@@ rom@@ bot@@ ic event ) .
this risk should be weighed very carefully over the benefits derived from treatment with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa , especially if you have an increased risk of th@@ rom@@ bot@@ ic vascular events , e.g. if you are obes@@ e ( obes@@ e ) or if there have been th@@ rom@@ bot@@ ic vascular events in the past ( e.g. deep ven@@ ous rom@@ bo@@ sis or pul@@ mon@@ ary em@@ bol@@ ism ) .
if you are cancer patient , keep in mind that stre@@ amed acts like a growth factor for blood cells and may have a negative effect on the tumour under certain circumstances .
if you have a major orthop@@ edic surgery , the cause of your an@@ a@@ emia should be examined and treated before the start of treatment with Ab@@ se@@ amed .
if your values of the red blood @-@ dy@@ e ( ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in ) are too high , you should not get Ab@@ se@@ amed , as there is an increased risk of blood cl@@ ots after surgery .
please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you use / use other medicines or have recently taken / applied medication even if it is not prescription medicine .
if you are taking C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( means of supp@@ ressing the immune system ) during your therapy with ab@@ se@@ amed , your doctor may prescri@@ be certain blood tests to measure the blood levels of C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in .
laboratory tests have shown no interaction between epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa and G @-@ CS@@ F or GM @-@ CS@@ F ( G @-@ CS@@ F and GM @-@ CS@@ F are a means of building the immune system , such as cancer chemotherapy or HIV ) .
depending on how your an@@ emia refers to the treatment , the dose can be adjusted approximately every four weeks until your condition is under control .
your doctor may prescri@@ be regular blood tests to check the treatment success and make sure that the medicine works properly and your hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in value does not exceed a certain value .
once you are well set , you will receive regular doses of stre@@ amed between 25 and 50 I.@@ U. / kg twice a week , distributed on two equally large inj@@ ections .
your doctor may prescri@@ be regular blood tests to check the success of the treatment and make sure that your hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in value does not exceed a certain value .
depending on how an@@ a@@ emia refers to the treatment , the dose can be adjusted approximately every four weeks until the condition is under control .
to ensure this and ensure that the hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in value does not exceed a certain value , the doctor treating the hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in will conduct regular blood tests .
if it is necessary to shor@@ ten the treatment time before the surgery , a dose of 300 I.@@ U. / kg can be given on 10 consecutive days before the surgery , on the day of the surgery and another 4 days after the surgery .
however , if your doctor considers this to be appropriate , you can also learn how to sp@@ lash ab@@ se@@ amed yourself under the skin .
heart , heart attacks , cereb@@ ral ha@@ em@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ ge , stroke , temporary circul@@ atory disorders , deep ven@@ ous thro@@ mb@@ oses , pul@@ mon@@ ary th@@ rom@@ bo@@ sis , pul@@ mon@@ ary th@@ rom@@ bo@@ sis , vascular diseases ( an@@ eur@@ ys@@ m ) , th@@ rom@@ bo@@ sis of the retina and blood cl@@ ots in artificial kidneys were reported in patients under er@@ y@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin @-@ treatment .
ey@@ eli@@ ds and lips ( Qu@@ in@@ cke @-@ Oil ) and shock @-@ like allergic reactions with symptoms such as ting@@ ling , redness , it@@ ching , fl@@ ush@@ ing , and accelerated pulse were reported in rare cases .
er@@ y@@ thro@@ bla@@ sto@@ sis means that no longer sufficient red blood cells can be formed in the bone mar@@ row ( see section &quot; Special caution when using Ab@@ se@@ amed is required &quot; ) .
after repeated blood donations , it can come to a blood cl@@ ot@@ ting ( th@@ rom@@ bot@@ ic vascular events ) regardless of the treatment with ab@@ se@@ amed .
treatment with stre@@ amed can be associated with increased risk of blood pro@@ p after surgery ( post @-@ operative th@@ rom@@ bot@@ ic vascular events ) , if your output ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in value is too high

Ac@@ la@@ sta is used to treat the following diseases : • Oste@@ opor@@ osis ( a disease that makes the bones br@@ ittle ) both in women after menop@@ ause and in men .
it is used in patients with a high frac@@ ture risk ( bone frac@@ tures ) , including patients who have recently undergone a trau@@ matic hip frac@@ ture such as the H@@ inf@@ allen ; • Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get of the bone , a disease that changes the normal course of bone growth .
in addition , patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get should take at least 500 mg of calcium twice daily for at least 10 days after treatment ; patients with hip frac@@ ture should receive a large dose of vitamin D ( 50 000 to 125 000 IE ) before the first in@@ fusion .
the administration of acet@@ am@@ ol or i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen ( inflammation ) shortly after the application of Ac@@ la@@ sta can reduce symptoms such as fever , muscle pain , flu @-@ like symptoms , joint pain and head@@ aches .
for the treatment of the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , Ac@@ la@@ sta can only be prescribed by doctors who have experience in treating this disease .
as the active ingredient in Ac@@ la@@ sta is the same as in z@@ omet@@ a , a part of the data material for z@@ omet@@ a was used to evaluate Ac@@ la@@ sta .
the first study included nearly 8@@ ,000 elderly women with oste@@ opor@@ osis , and the number of spinal and hip frac@@ tures was examined over a period of three years .
the second study included 2 127 men and women with oste@@ opor@@ osis over 50 years who had recently undergone a hip frac@@ ture ; the number of frac@@ tures was examined over a period of up to five years .
at Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , Ac@@ la@@ sta was tested in two studies tot@@ alling 3@@ 57 patients and compared with Ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ at ( another bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate ) for six months .
the main indicator of efficacy was whether the content of alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase in serum ( an enzyme that decreases bone substance ) in the blood norm@@ alized or decreased by at least 75 % compared to the initial value .
in the study with older women , the risk of verteb@@ rate frac@@ tures in patients under Ac@@ la@@ sta ( without other oste@@ opor@@ osis treatments ) was reduced by 70 % over a period of three years .
compared to patients under Ac@@ la@@ sta ( with or without any other oste@@ opor@@ osis treatment ) with those under placebo , the risk of hip frac@@ tures was reduced by 41 % .
in the study involving men and women with hip frac@@ ture , 9 % of patients under Ac@@ la@@ sta had a frac@@ ture ( 92 of 1 0@@ 65 ) compared to 13 % of patients under placebo ( 139 of 1 0@@ 62 ) .
most of the side effects of acet@@ one occur within the first three days after in@@ fusion and are less frequent in repeated in@@ fu@@ sions .
Ac@@ la@@ sta may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ei@@ c acid or other bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate or any of the other ingredients .
as with all bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates , patients with ac@@ la@@ sta are subject to the risk of kidney problems , reactions to the in@@ fusion point and oste@@ o@@ arthritis ( death of bone tissue ) in the jaw .
Ac@@ la@@ sta &apos;s manufacturer provides information on physicians to prescri@@ be acet@@ ate for the treatment of oste@@ opor@@ osis , which contains instructions on how to use the medicine , as well as similar material for patients where the side effects of the medicine are explained and indicated when they should contact the doctor .
in April 2005 , the European Commission issued a permit to Nov@@ arti@@ s Euro@@ ph@@ arm Limited to acquire Ac@@ la@@ sta &apos;s placing on the market in the entire European Union .

treatment of oste@@ opor@@ osis in post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women and in men with increased risk of frac@@ tures , including in patients with a recently suffered low @-@ trau@@ matic hip frac@@ ture .
the patient information package should be provided and the following core messages include : • The package insert • Con@@ tra@@ dic@@ ation of calcium and vitamin D , appropriate physical activity , non @-@ smoking and a healthy diet • Import@@ ant signs and symptoms for serious side effects • When to resort to medical or nursing assistance
oste@@ opor@@ osis treatment in post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women • in men with increased risk of frac@@ tures , including patients with a recently suffered low @-@ trau@@ matic hip frac@@ ture .
for the treatment of post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ osis and oste@@ opor@@ osis in men , an intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion of 5 mg Ac@@ la@@ sta is recommended once a year .
in patients with a low @-@ trau@@ matic hip frac@@ ture , the in@@ fusion of acet@@ one in@@ fusion is recommended two or more weeks after the surgical treatment of the hip frac@@ ture ( see Section 5.1 ) .
for the treatment of the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , Ac@@ la@@ sta should only be prescribed by doctors who have experience in treating the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get .
after treatment of the disease Pa@@ get with Ac@@ la@@ sta a long re@@ mission period was observed in patients who responded to the therapy ( see Section 5.1 ) .
in addition , it is highly advisable to provide sufficient calcium intake for patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , accordingly twice daily at least 500 mg of elementary calcium for at least 10 days after the administration of Ac@@ la@@ sta ( see section 4.4 ) .
in patients with a recently suffered low @-@ trau@@ matic hip frac@@ ture an initial dose of 50,000 to 12@@ 5,000 I.@@ U. of or@@ ally or intra@@ muscular vitamin D is recommended before the first acet@@ ate in@@ fusion .
the frequency of symptoms occurring within the first three days after the administration of acet@@ am@@ ol or i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen can be reduced shortly after the application of Ac@@ la@@ sta .
patients with kidney function disorder ( see section 4.4 ) In patients with a cre@@ atine clearing &lt; 35 ml / min , Ac@@ la@@ sta is not recommended because limited clinical experience is available for this group of patients .
elderly patients ( ≥ 65 years ) A dose adaptation is not necessary , as the bio@@ availability , distribution and elimination of older patients is similar to younger patients .
children and adolescents Ac@@ la@@ sta are not recommended for use in children and adolescents under the age of 18 , as data is lacking for safety and effectiveness .
Ac@@ la@@ sta is not recommended in patients with severe kidney failure ( Cre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance &lt; 35 ml / min ) as there are limited clinical experience for these patients .
pre@@ existing hypo@@ kal@@ emia is to be treated with Ac@@ la@@ sta before starting treatment with calcium and vitamin D ( see Section 4.3 ) .
due to the rapid insertion of the effect of z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ y@@ lic acid on bone reconstruction , a temporary , sometimes sympt@@ om@@ atic hypo@@ kal@@ emia can develop , the maximum occurs usually within the first 10 days after the in@@ fusion of Ac@@ la@@ sta ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) .
in addition , it is highly advisable to ensure adequate intake of calcium for at least 10 days after the gift of Ac@@ la@@ sta in patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get ( see section 4.2 ) .
cancer , chemotherapy , treatment with cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids ( poor oral hygiene ) should be examined with appropriate preventive dental treatment before applying bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate .
there are no data available for patients who need dental interventions , whether the interruption of the treatment with bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates reduces the risk of oste@@ on@@ ec@@ ro@@ sis in the jaw@@ s .
the clinical evaluation by the treating physician should be the basis for the treatment plan of each patient and based on an individual benefit @-@ risk assessment .
the frequency of symptoms occurring within the first three days after administration of acet@@ am@@ ol or i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen can be reduced shortly after the application of Ac@@ la@@ sta ( see section 4.2 ) .
the incidence of cases of atri@@ al fi@@ bri@@ ll@@ ation reported as a serious side effect was increased ( 1.3 % ) ( 51 of 3,@@ 8@@ 62 ) compared to patients receiving placebo ( 0.@@ 6 % ) ( 22 of 3,@@ 8@@ 52 ) .
in the oste@@ opor@@ osis studies ( PFT , H@@ OR@@ I@@ Z@@ ON - Rec@@ ur@@ rent Fra@@ c@@ ture Trial &#91; R@@ FT &#93; ) , the total frequency of atri@@ al fi@@ bri@@ ll@@ ation between Ac@@ la@@ sta ( 2.6 % ) and placebo ( 2.1 % ) was comparable .
very common ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) , occasional ( ≥ 1 / 1000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) , rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 , &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) of adverse drug effects are listed in Table 1 .
kidney function disorder ( z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ utri@@ ent ) was associated with kidney function disorders , which , as a decrease in the ren@@ al function ( i.e. an increase in serum cre@@ atine ) and in rare cases , expressed as acute ren@@ al failure .
the change in the cre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance ( measured annually before the administration ) and the occurrence of kidney failure as well as a limited ren@@ al function were comparable in a clinical study for oste@@ opor@@ osis over three years between the Ac@@ la@@ sta@@ - and the placebo group .
a temporary increase in serum cre@@ at@@ in@@ ins within 10 days of the gift was observed in 1.8 % of patients treated with Ac@@ la@@ sta compared to 0.8 % of patients treated with placebo .
based on the evaluation of the laboratory findings , the temporary asy@@ mpt@@ om@@ atic calcium levels below the normal fluctu@@ ation range ( less than 2.@@ 10 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) occurred in 2.3 % of patients treated with Ac@@ la@@ sta in a large clinical study compared to 21 % of patients treated with ac@@ la@@ sta in the disease patho@@ gens .
all patients received sufficient amounts of vitamin D and calcium in the post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ osis study , in the study to prevent clinical frac@@ tures after hip frac@@ ture and in the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get studies ( see section 4.2 ) .
in the study of preventing clinical frac@@ tures after a recently suffered hip frac@@ ture , vitamin D levels were not rout@@ inely measured but the majority of patients received an initial dose of vitamin D prior to the administration of Ac@@ la@@ sta ( see section 4.2 ) .
local reactions following the administration of z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ y@@ lic acid in a large clinical study were reported about local reactions at the in@@ fusion point , such as redness , swelling and / or pain ( 0.@@ 7 % ) .
oste@@ on@@ ec@@ ro@@ sis in the jaw@@ s of the jaw@@ s has been reported , especially in cancer patients , via oste@@ on@@ ec@@ ro@@ sis ( primarily in the jaw region ) , which were treated with bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates , including Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ei@@ c acid .
many of these patients had signs of local infections including oste@@ om@@ y@@ eli@@ tis , and the majority of reports refer to cancer patients after tooth extraction or other dental procedures .
seven patients with 7,@@ 7@@ 36 patients treated oste@@ o@@ arthritis in the jaw@@ s of a patient with ac@@ la@@ sta and a placebo @-@ treated patients .
in case of over@@ dose , which leads to clin@@ ically relevant hypo@@ kal@@ emia , a compensation of oral calcium and / or an intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion of calcium glu@@ con@@ ate can be achieved .
clinical effectiveness in the treatment of post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ osis ( PFT ) The effectiveness and safety of Ac@@ la@@ sta 5 mg once a year for 3 consecutive years has been shown in post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women ( 7,@@ 7@@ 36 women aged between 65 and 89 years ) with either a bone density value ( BM@@ D ) -@@ T @-@ S@@ core for the sk@@ enk@@ el@@ h@@ al ≤ -@@ 2,5 with or without signs of an existing verteb@@ ral frac@@ ture .
effects on morph@@ ometric fluid frac@@ tures Ac@@ la@@ sta sen@@ sed significantly over a period of three years and already after one year the frequency of one or more new verteb@@ ral frac@@ tures ( see table 2 ) .
ac@@ la@@ sta @-@ treated patients aged 75 years and older had a 60 % reduced risk of verteb@@ rate frac@@ tures compared to placebo patients ( p &lt; 0.00@@ 01 ) .
effects on hip frac@@ tures Ac@@ la@@ sta showed a consistent lasting effect over three years , resulting in a reduced risk of hip frac@@ tures in a 41 % ( 95 % CI , 17 % to 58 % ) .
effect on bone density ( BM@@ D ) Ac@@ la@@ sta increased bone density on lum@@ bar verteb@@ ra@@ ic acid , hip and dist@@ al radius compared to placebo treatment at all times ( 6 , 12 , 24 and 36 months ) .
9 Incre@@ ase of the bone density of the lum@@ bar spine by 6.@@ 7 % , the entire hip by 6.@@ 0 % , the lower leg by 5.1 % and the dist@@ al radius by 3.2 % .
bone hist@@ ology With 152 post @-@ menop@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ otic patients treated with Ac@@ la@@ sta ( N = 82 ) or placebo ( N = 70 ) , a year after the third annual dose of bone biop@@ si@@ es , bone biop@@ si@@ es from the pel@@ vic area were taken .
in comparison with placebo , a micro@@ computer tom@@ ography ( µ@@ CT ) analysis showed an increase in tra@@ be@@ cular bone volume and the preservation of the tra@@ be@@ cular bone architecture .
bone turnover marker The bone @-@ specific alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase ( B@@ SAP ) , the N @-@ terminal pro@@ pe@@ p@@ tide of the type I@@ - col@@ lagen ( P@@ 1@@ NP ) in serum and the beta @-@ C tel@@ op@@ ep@@ ti@@ d ( b @-@ CT@@ x ) in serum were determined in sub@@ groups of 5@@ 17 to 1,@@ 24@@ 6 patients during periods of study .
the treatment with an annual 5 mg dose Ac@@ la@@ sta significantly reduced B@@ SAP after 12 months compared to bas@@ eline and was held at 28 % below the initial value up to 36 months .
P@@ 1@@ NP was significantly reduced by 61 % below the initial value after 12 months and was held at 52 % below the initial value up to 36 months .
B @-@ CT@@ x was significantly reduced by 61 % below the initial value after 12 months and was maintained at 55 % below the initial value up to 36 months .
the vitamin D mirrors were not rout@@ inely measured but the majority of patients received initial dose of vitamin D ( 50.000 to 12@@ 5,000 I.@@ U. in oral or intra@@ muscular ) 2 weeks prior to in@@ fusion .
the total mort@@ ality was 10 % ( 101 patients ) in the group treated with Ac@@ la@@ sta compared to 13 % ( 141 patients ) in the placebo group .
effect on bone mineral density ( BM@@ D ) In the H@@ OR@@ I@@ Z@@ ON @-@ R@@ FT study , the ac@@ la@@ sta treatment increased BM@@ D compared to placebo treatment at all times .
the treatment of acet@@ la@@ sta over 24 months compared to placebo treatment led to an increase of BM@@ D by 5.@@ 4 % in total and 4.3 % at the Sch@@ enk@@ el@@ h@@ al .
clinical efficacy in men In the H@@ OR@@ I@@ Z@@ ON @-@ R@@ FT study , 50@@ 8 men were random@@ ised and in 185 patients the BM@@ D was evaluated after 24 months .
the study was not designed to show a reduction in clinical frac@@ tures in men ; the incidence of clinical frac@@ tures was 7.5 % in men treated by Ac@@ la@@ sta compared to 8.@@ 7 % in placebo .
in another study in males ( Study CZ@@ O@@ L@@ 44@@ 6@@ M@@ 230@@ 8 ) , the once annual administration of Ac@@ la@@ sta was not inferior to the percentage change in the lum@@ bar verteb@@ ra@@ e BM@@ D compared to the previous year compared to the initial value .
clinical effectiveness of the treatment with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get of the bone Ac@@ la@@ sta has been studied in patients aged over 30 years with radi@@ ologically verified ( medium serum levels of alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase according to the 2,@@ 6@@ fold to 3 @-@ fold age @-@ specific upper normal value when taking into the study ) .
11 The effectiveness of an in@@ fusion of 5 mg of z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ei@@ c acid compared to intake of 30 mg of ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ ate once daily during 2 months was proven in two six months comparative studies .
in the combined results , a similar decrease in pain strength and pain influence was observed after 6 months compared to the initial value for ac@@ la@@ sta and ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ ate .
patients who were classified as response to therapy at the end of the six @-@ month main study ( responded to therapy ) could be included in a follow @-@ up phase .
from the 143 with ac@@ la@@ sta and 107 patients treated with Ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ at patients who participated in the follow @-@ up study , the therapeutic response at 141 of patients treated with Ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ at could be maintained in an average duration of the follow @-@ up phase of 18 months after the application .
one @-@ time and multiple 5 and 15 minutes lasting in@@ fusion of 2 , 4 , 8 and 16 mg of z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ei@@ c acid in 64 patients showed the following pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic data , which proved to be dos@@ is@@ independent .
after that , the plasma level rapidly decreased to &lt; 10 % of the maximum value after 4 h and &lt; 1 % after 24 h , followed by a long @-@ lasting phase of very low concentration , not more than 0.1 % of the maximum value .
rapid bi@@ pha@@ sic dis@@ appearing from the large cycle with half @-@ life t ½ α = 0.@@ 24 and t ½ β 1.@@ 87 hours , followed by a long period of elimination with a terminal Eli@@ min@@ ation period t ½ g 146 hours .
the early stages of distribution ( α and β , with the above t ½ -@@ values ) presumably represent the rapid res@@ or@@ ption into the bones and ex@@ cre@@ tion via the kidneys .
in the first 24 hours there are 39 ± 16 % of the administered dose in the urine , while the rest is mainly bon@@ ded to bone tissue .
the total body @-@ clearance is independent of the dose 5.@@ 04 ± 2.5 l / h and remains unaffected by sex , age , race or body weight .
an extension of the in@@ fusion time of 5 to 15 minutes led to decrease of the z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid concentration by 30 % at the end of the in@@ fusion , but had no effect on the surface under the curve ( plasma concentration at time ) .
a dimin@@ ished clear@@ ance of metabol@@ ised substances by cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom P@@ 450 enzyme systems is unlikely because z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ei@@ c acid is not met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed in humans and because it is a weak or no direct and / or ir@@ reversible , substance @-@ dependent inhibit@@ or of P@@ 4@@ 50@@ -
special patient groups ( see section 4.2 ) The ren@@ al clearing of the z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid cor@@ related with the cre@@ at@@ in@@ in clearing , namely 75 ± 33 % of the cre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance , and was in the mean 84 ± 29 ml / min ( range 22 to 143 ml / min ) in the 64 examined patients .
this results in an easy ( Cl@@ c@@ r = 50@@ - 80 ml / min ) and a moderate ren@@ al dysfunction down to a cre@@ atine clearing up to 35 ml / min does not require any dose adaptation of the z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ei@@ c acid .
because there are only limited data for severe kidney function disorder ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in- Clear@@ ance &lt; 30 ml / min ) , no statements are possible for this population .
acute toxic@@ ity The highest non @-@ plat@@ inum @-@ acting intraven@@ ous single dose was 10 mg / kg body weight in mice and 0.@@ 6 mg / kg body weight in rats .
for studies on dogs single doses of 1,0 mg / kg ( based on AU@@ C , six times the recommended human @-@ therapeutic exposure ) , administered over a period of 15 minutes , well and without a ren@@ al influence .
chronic and chronic toxic@@ ity In studies with intraven@@ ous application , the ren@@ al toler@@ ability of z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid in rats was administered by doses of 0.@@ 6 mg / kg as 15 @-@ minute in@@ fusion in 3 @-@ day intervals , a total of 6 times ( a cum@@ ulative dose corresponding to the 7@@ x of the human @-@ therapeutic exposure , related to the AU@@ C , corresponds to the AU@@ C ) .
in long @-@ term studies with repeated exposure to cum@@ ulated expos@@ ures that exceeded the maximum of intended human exposure , toxic@@ ological effects in other organs including gastro@@ intestinal tract and liver , as well as the intraven@@ ous injection site , occurred .
the most frequent occurrence in studies with repeated use was an increased primary spon@@ gi@@ osa in the met@@ ap@@ hy@@ sis of the long bones in animals in the growth phase with almost all dos@@ ages , an infection that reflects the pharmac@@ ological , anti@@ res@@ or@@ phi@@ c effect of the substance .
in rats a ter@@ ato@@ gen@@ eity was observed in doses above 0.2 mg / kg as outer and inner ( vis@@ cer@@ al ) ab@@ norm@@ alities and such of the skel@@ eton .
no ter@@ ato@@ genic effects or embryo @-@ fet@@ al effects were observed on rab@@ bits , although the mat@@ ernal toxic@@ ity was 0.1 mg / kg as a result of low serum calcium levels .
if the medicine is not used immediately , the user is responsible for the storage time after preparation and the conditions before the application ; normally 24 hours should not be exceeded at 2 ° C to 8 ° C .

with the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get bone reconstruction is too fast , and new bone material is built in an un@@ organised way , which makes the bone material weaker than normal .
Ac@@ la@@ sta works by normal@@ ising the bone reconstruction , ensuring normal bone formation and gives the bone its strength once again .
if you are undergoing dental treatment or undergoing dental surgery , tell your doctor that you are treated with Ac@@ la@@ sta .
if you use Ac@@ la@@ sta with other medicines , please inform your doctor , pharmac@@ ist or nursing staff if you use / apply other medicines or have recently taken / applied medication even if it is not prescription medicine .
it is especially important for your doctor to know if you are taking medicine that is known to damage the kidneys .
when using Ac@@ la@@ sta along with food and drink , you should be worried that you have enough fluids according to your doctor &apos;s instructions before and after the treatment with Ac@@ la@@ sta .
the usual dose is 5 mg once a year given to you by your doctor or nursing staff as in@@ fusion in a vein .
if you recently broke the hip , it is recommended to make the administration of Ac@@ la@@ sta two or more weeks after the hip frac@@ ture .
the usual dose is 5 mg administered to you by your doctor or nursing staff as in@@ fusion in a vein .
since Ac@@ la@@ sta works for a long time , you may need another dose only after one year or more .
it is important to follow these instructions carefully so that the calcium level in your blood is not too low in time after in@@ fusion .

A@@ COMP@@ LIA is additionally applied to a diet and exercise for the treatment of adult patients , which suffer from obesity ( body mass index - BM@@ I ) of 30 kg / m ² or above , respectively , which are overweight ( BM@@ I of 27 kg / m ² or above ) and additionally one or more
in addition , four studies were conducted to over 7@@ ,000 patients in which A@@ COMP@@ LIA was used as a suppor@@ tive agent for setting smoking .
on the other hand , the studies on the setting of smoking showed no uniform results , so the effect of A@@ COMP@@ LIA was difficult to assess in this field of application .
what is associated with A@@ COMP@@ LIA ? he The most common side effects of A@@ COMP@@ LIA that were observed during studies ( observed in more than 1 of 10 patients ) were nausea and upper respiratory infections .
it may also not be used in patients suffering from an existing severe depression or treated with anti@@ depres@@ s@@ ants , as it can increase the risk of depression and , among other things , cause su@@ ici@@ dal thoughts in a small minority of patients .
caution is recommended when using A@@ COMP@@ LIA with medicines such as k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ol or I@@ con@@ con@@ az@@ ole ( medicines for fung@@ al infections ) , k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( a remedy for use with HIV infection ) , t@@ eli@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or cl@@ ari@@ thro@@ my@@ cin ( antibiotics ) .

the Committee on Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that A@@ COMP@@ LIA &apos;s efficacy in weight reduction in patients with obesity or overweight
medication used in patients who need it for health reasons and not for cosmetic reasons ( by providing re@@ conn@@ aissance packages for patients and doctors ) , and around the Ar@@ z
in addition to diet and exercise for the treatment of obesity ( BM@@ I ≥ 30 kg / m ² ) or overweight patients ( BM@@ I &gt; 27 kg / m ² ) , which also exhibit one or more risk factors such as type 2 diabetes or dy@@ sli@@ pi@@ d@@ emia ( see Section 5.1 ) .
A@@ COMP@@ LIA is not recommended for use in children and adolescents under the age of 18 due to lack of data on efficacy and safety .
depres@@ sive disorders or mood changes with depres@@ sive symptoms were reported in up to 10 % , su@@ ici@@ dal thoughts with up to 1 % of patients receiving Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) .
in case of depres@@ sive disorders , Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant may not be used unless the benefits of treatment in the individual case out@@ weigh the risk ( see Section 4.3 and 4.@@ 8 ) .
in patients who - besides obesity - there are no recognis@@ able risks , depres@@ sive reactions can occur .
relatives or other close relatives ) must point out that it is necessary to monitor the occurrence of such symptoms and immediately seek medical advice if these symptoms occur .
• Ol@@ der patients The effectiveness and safety of Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant during the treatment of patients over 75 years were not shown sufficiently .
patients with a cardiovascular event ( m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction or stroke , etc . ) less than 6 months ago were excluded from studies with Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant .

patients with overweight patients as well as in patients with obesity have examined , and in addition to 3@@ 800 patients in further indications .
the following table ( Table 1 ) shows the adverse effects of placebo @-@ controlled trials in patients who have been treated for weight reduction and metabolic diseases .
although the incidence was statisti@@ cally significant higher than corresponding plac@@ eb@@ or@@ ate ( for un@@ desirable effects ≥ 1 % ) or if they were clin@@ ically relevant ( for un@@ desirable effects &lt; 1 % ) . NG For the evaluation of side effects , the following frequency is measured :
very common ( ≥ 10 % ) ; often ( ≥ 1 , &lt; 10 % ) ; occasionally ( ≥ 0.@@ 01 , &lt; 0.1 % ) ; very good
in an assessment study , where a limited number of individuals administered up to 300 mg , only slight symptoms were observed .
the patients had a BM@@ I ≥ 30 kg / m ² or BM@@ I &gt; 27 kg / m ² and a simultaneous hypertension and / or dy@@ sli@@ p@@ ide@@ mia .
n weight reduction after one year for A@@ COMP@@ LIA was 20 mg 6,5 kg , relative to bas@@ eline , compared to 1.6 kg for the placebo group ( difference -@@ 4.@@ 9 kg CI@@ 95 % -@@ 5.3 ; -@@ 4,@@ 4 , p &lt; 0,@@ 001 ) .
the patients treated with A@@ COMP@@ LIA 20 mg , and 1.2 kg in the placebo group ( difference - 3,@@ 8 kg ; CI@@ 95 % -@@ 4,@@ 4 , -@@ 3.3 ; p &lt; 0,@@ 001 ) .
after 2 years the difference in total weight reduction was between A@@ COMP@@ LIA and placebo -@@ 4.2 kg ( CI@@ 95 % -@@ 5.0 % ; -@@ 3,@@ 4 , p &lt; 0,@@ 001 ) .
9 Wei@@ ght reduction and other risk factors In the studies in patients without diabetes , in which a mixed population of patients with
Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant 20 mg received an average tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ des of 6.@@ 9 % ( initial tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ des 1.@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) compared to an increase of 5.@@ 8 %
in a second study in patients with obesity and previously untreated Type 2 diabetes ( Ser@@ en@@ ade ) , the absolute variation of the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c value ( with an initial value of 7.@@ 9 % for both groups ) was 6 months -@@ 0.8 for Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant 20 mg and -@@ 0.3 in placebo I
the percentage of patients receiving a H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c@@ - value of &lt; 7 % was 51 % in the Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant group and 35 % in the placebo group .
the difference in the mean weight change between the 20 M@@ g@@ - and the placebo group was 3,@@ 8 kg ( CI@@ 95 % -@@ 5,@@ 0 , -@@ 2,@@ 6 p &lt; 0.@@ 001 ) .
improvement of the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c value in patients who had taken Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant 20 mg were about 50 % due to direct effects of Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant and about 50 % explained by weight reduction . n eim
the Ste@@ ady State plasma levels were reached after 13 days ( C@@ max = 196 ± 28.@@ 1 ng / ml ; C@@ trough = 9@@ 1,6 ± 14.@@ 1 ng / ml ; AU@@ C@@ 0 @-@ 24 = 29@@ 60 ± 26@@ 8 n@@ g.@@ h / ml ) .
influence of food : he subjects who received Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant either in so@@ ber@@ ing condition or after a fat @-@ rich meal , increased by 67 % higher C@@ max or 48 % increased ng AU@@ C in the case of food intake .
patients with black skin color can have an up to 31 % lower C@@ max and a 43 % lower AU@@ C than patients of other ethnic populations .
n population mac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic analyses ( age range 18@@ - 81 years ) is estimated that a 75 @-@ year @-@ old patient has a 21 % higher C@@ max and a 27 % higher AU@@ C than a 40 @-@ year @-@ old
5.3 Pre@@ clinical data for the safety of subsequent adverse effects , which were not observed in clinical studies but which occurred in animals after exposure to human therapeutic areas , were assessed as potentially relevant for clinical application :
in some , however , not in all cases the beginning of conv@@ ul@@ sions appears to be associated with proced@@ ural stress such as dealing with animals .
if Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant was given over a longer period before the p@@ airing ( 9 weeks ) , which allowed a recovery from the initial effects of Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant , no unwanted effects were observed on the fertility or cycle distur@@ b@@ ance .
the influence of Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant on pre@@ - and post@@ nat@@ al development was studied at the rat in dos@@ ages of up to 10 mg / kg / day .
in a study of rats for pre@@ - and post@@ nat@@ al development an exposure with Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant in uter@@ o and via lac@@ tation did not cause any changes in learning behavior or memory .

summary of the EP@@ AR to the public The present document is a summary of the European Public Transport Report ( EP@@ AR ) , which explains how the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) has assessed the studies carried out to make recommendations regarding the use of the drug .
Ac@@ tos is used for the treatment of type 2 diabetes ( also known as non @-@ insulin @-@ dependent diabetes ) . it can be used alone ( mon@@ otherapy ) in patients ( especially overweight patients ) where met@@ form@@ in ( a diabetes drug ) is not indicated .
it can be used in addition to met@@ form@@ in in patients ( especially overweight patients ) who cannot be satisfactory with met@@ form@@ in alone in the highest tolerated dose .
in combination with a sul@@ fon@@ y@@ res@@ p or insulin , the previous dose of the sul@@ phon@@ yl resin or insulin can be retained with the on@@ set of the Ac@@ tos treatment , except in patients with hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia ( low blood sugar ) ; this should reduce the dose of the sul@@ phon@@ yl resin or insulin .
this means that the body &apos;s insulin can be better utilized and the blood sugar level drops , allowing type 2 diabetes to be better adjusted .
in more than 1,@@ 400 patients the efficacy of Ac@@ tos was studied in tri@@ ple@@ therapy ; patients received a combination of met@@ form@@ in with a sul@@ phon@@ yl resin , in addition they received up to 3.5 years either Ac@@ tos or placebo .
in the studies the concentration of a substance in the blood ( gly@@ cos@@ yl@@ ated hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in , H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) was measured , indicating how well the blood sugar is set .
Ac@@ tos led to a lowering of the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c value , which makes it possible to reduce blood sugar levels by using the dosage of 15 mg , 30 mg and 45 mg .
at the end of the tri@@ ple@@ therapy study , the effect of the additional administration of ac@@ tos for existing treatment with met@@ form@@ in and a sul@@ fon@@ y@@ ph@@ er was reduced by 0.@@ 94 % while the additional addition of placebo resulted in a reduction of 0.@@ 35 % .
in a small study , where the combination of ac@@ tos and insulin was studied in 28@@ 9 patients , patients who received insulin in addition to insulin were lowering H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c values of 0.@@ 69 % after 6 months , compared with 0.@@ 14 % in patients receiving placebo .
the most common side effects associated with Ac@@ tos were visual disturbances , upper respiratory tract infections ( col@@ ds ) , weight gain and hypo@@ the@@ tics ( decreased sensitivity to stimul@@ i ) .
Ac@@ tos should not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one or any of the other components , nor in patients with liver problems , con@@ ges@@ tive heart failure or diabe@@ tic k@@ eto@@ aci@@ dosis ( high level of ket@@ one levels - acid levels - in the blood ) .
it has been decided that Ac@@ tos should be used as an alternative to standard treatment with met@@ form@@ in in patients where met@@ form@@ in is not indicated .
in October 2000 , the European Commission issued a permit to Tak@@ eda Europe R &amp; D Centre Limited to appro@@ ve Ac@@ tos &apos; placing on the market throughout the European Union .
the tablets are white to whi@@ tish , round , arch@@ ed and carry on one side the mark &quot; 15 &quot; and on the other hand the inscription &quot; Ac@@ tos . &quot;
pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one is also indicated for the combination of insulin for patients with type 2 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus whose blood sugar is insufficient with insulin and where met@@ form@@ in is in@@ appropriate due to contra@@ indications or intoler@@ ance ( see section 4.4 ) .
no data is available for the application of pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one in patients under 18 years of age , therefore the application in this age group is not recommended .
in patients who are at risk of developing at least one risk factor ( e.g. earlier cardiac inf@@ ar@@ ction or sympt@@ om@@ atic cor@@ on@@ ary heart disease ) , the physician should start the treatment with the lowest available dose and increase the dose gradually .
patients should be observed for signs and symptoms of heart failure , weight gain or e@@ dem@@ a , especially those with reduced cardiac reserve .
patients should be observed for signs and symptoms of heart failure , weight gain , and e@@ dem@@ a when pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one is used in combination with insulin .
a cardiovascular outcome study with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one in patients under 75 years with type 2 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus and pre @-@ existing advanced mac@@ rov@@ ascular disease has been carried out .
this study showed an increase in the report on heart failure , but this did not lead to an increase in mortality in the study .
in patients with elevated output h@@ ep@@ atic ( AL@@ T &gt; 2.5 x upper limit ) or with other signs of liver disease , Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one may not be used .
if the AL@@ T mirrors are increased to 3 times the upper limit of the normal range , the liver enzyme levels are to be checked again as soon as possible .
if a patient develops symptoms that indicate a h@@ ep@@ atic dysfunction , such as un@@ explained nausea , vom@@ iting , abdominal pain , fatigue , loss of appetite and / or dark urine , the liver enzyme levels are to be examined .
the decision whether the treatment of the patient with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one continues , should be guided by the clinical evaluation until the completion of the laboratory parameters .
in clinical studies with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one , a dose @-@ dependent weight gain has been detected , which can stem from adi@@ pose deposits and is associated with a fluid retention in some cases .
as a result of hem@@ odi@@ lution , a minor reduction of the mean hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in values ( relative reduction of 4 % ) and hem@@ at@@ ok@@ r@@ ite ( relative reduction of 4.1 % ) occurred under the treatment with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one .
similar changes were observed in comparative controlled trials with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one in patients under met@@ form@@ in ( relative reduction of hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in by 3 @-@ 4 % and hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in by 1 @-@ 2 % and hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in by 1 @-@ 3.2 % ) .
as a consequence of increased insulin sensitivity , patients who receive Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one as oral two @-@ fold or triple combination therapy with a sul@@ fon@@ y@@ res@@ p or as two @-@ fold combination therapy with insulin have the risk of dos@@ ed hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia .
after the market launch was reported under treatment with thi@@ az@@ ol@@ d@@ indi@@ ons , including pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one , via a occurrence or deterioration of diabe@@ tic mac@@ ular e@@ dem@@ a with a reduction in visual acuity .
it is unclear whether there is direct connection between the intake of pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one and the occurrence of mac@@ ular e@@ dem@@ a , but cor@@ n@@ ering doctors should be aware of the possibility of mac@@ ular e@@ dem@@ a when patients report about disorders of visual acuity ; a suitable ophthalm@@ ological examination should be considered .
in a summari@@ zing analysis of adverse events regarding bone frac@@ tures from random@@ ised controlled , controlled , double @-@ blind clinical studies over a period of up to 3.5 years with over 8,@@ 100 patients treated with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one
the calculated frac@@ ture incidence was 1.@@ 9 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years in patients treated with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one and 1.1 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years in women treated with a comparative medication .
in the Pro@@ Active study , a study of 3.5 years for the study of cardiovascular events , frac@@ tures occurred at 44 / 8@@ 70 ( 5.1 % ; 1.0 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years ) of patients treated with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one , compared with 23 / 9@@ 05 ( 2.5 % ; 0.5 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years ) in patients who were treated with a comparative medication .
patients should be aware of the possibility of a pregnancy and if a patient wishes to receive a pregnancy or if this occurs , the treatment is to be abor@@ ted ( see section 4.6 ) .
studies on the interaction of interactions have shown that Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one has no relevant effects on the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics or pharmac@@ o@@ dynamics of di@@ go@@ x@@ in , war@@ far@@ in , phen@@ proc@@ ou@@ mon and met@@ form@@ in .
interactions with medicines that are met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed by these enzymes , such as oral contrac@@ ep@@ tives , cy@@ clos@@ por@@ ine , calcium channel blo@@ cker and H@@ M@@ G@@ Co@@ A reduc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ ors are not expected .
the simultaneous use of pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one with gem@@ fibro@@ zi@@ l ( a cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8@@ - inhibit@@ or ) resulted in an increase in the AU@@ C of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one by 3 @-@ fold .
the simultaneous use of pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one with ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in ( a cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8 induc@@ tor ) resulted in lowering the AU@@ C of pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one by 54 % .
this is due to the fact that , under treatment with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one , the hyper@@ insulin sensitivity associated with pregnancy increases and increases the availability of the metabolic substrates for fet@@ al growth .
very common &gt; 1 / 10 ; often &gt; 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 100 ; occasionally &gt; 1 / 10@@ 000 , &lt; 1 / 1000 ; very rare &lt; 1 / 10@@ 000 , single cases : unknown ( not estimated from present data ) .
these lead to a temporary alteration of the tur@@ g@@ or and refra@@ ction index of the lens , as observed in other hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic agents .
in clinical studies with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one , AL@@ T @-@ An@@ sti@@ ege were more than three times the upper limit of the normal range as often as under placebo , but less often than in comparison groups under met@@ form@@ in or sul@@ fon@@ y@@ res@@ p .
in an outcome study in patients with advanced mac@@ rov@@ ascular disease incidence of severe heart failure under pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one was 1.6 % higher than placebo , if pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one or pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one .
since market launch has rarely been reported on cardiac in@@ suffici@@ ency in Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one , however , more frequently if pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one was used in combination with insulin or in patients with con@@ ges@@ tive heart failure in an@@ am@@ n@@ esis .
a summari@@ zing analysis of adverse events regarding bone frac@@ tures from random@@ ised controlled , controlled , double @-@ blind clinical studies over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,@@ 100 patients in the groups treated with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one and more than 7,@@ 400 patients were performed in groups treated with comparative medication .
over a period of 3.5 years , frac@@ tures were treated at 44 / 8@@ 70 ( 5.1 % ) of patients treated with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one , compared with 23 / 9@@ 05 ( 2.5 % ) in patients who were treated with a comparative medication .
when taking the reported maximum dose of 120 mg / day for four days , then 180 mg / day over seven days , no symptoms appeared .
pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one seems to have an activation of specific core recept@@ ors ( per@@ ox@@ is@@ ome proliferation activated re@@ ep@@ tor @-@ γ ) ( P@@ PA@@ R @-@ γ ) ) , leading to increased insulin sensitivity of liver , fat and skel@@ etal muscle cells in the animal model .
it could be demonstrated that Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one reduces glucose production in the liver and increases the peripheral glucose level in the case of insulin resistance .
a clinical study with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one versus G@@ lic@@ la@@ cide as mon@@ otherapy has been continued for two years to investigate the time to follow the therapeutic effect ( defined as H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ≥ 8.@@ 0 % after the first 6 months of treatment ) .
at the time after two years after the beginning of the therapy , blood sugar control ( defined as H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c &lt; 8.@@ 0 % ) could be maintained by pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one in 69 % of the patients treated ( compared to 50 % of patients under G@@ lic@@ la@@ cide ) .
in a placebo @-@ controlled trial over 12 months , patients whose blood sugar was insufficient with insulin despite three months of optimization were random@@ ised to pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one or placebo .
in patients below Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one , the mean H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c decreased by 0.@@ 45 % compared to patients receiving insulin ; a reduction in insulin dose in the group treated with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one was observed .
in clinical trials over a year , a statisti@@ cally significant decrease of alb@@ um@@ in / cre@@ at@@ in@@ ine qu@@ oti@@ ents showed a statisti@@ cally significant decrease of alb@@ um@@ in / cre@@ at@@ in@@ in quot@@ i@@ ents .
the effect of pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one ( mon@@ otherapy with 45 mg versus placebo ) was tested in a small , 18 @-@ week study of type 2 diabetes .
in most clinical trials compared to placebo , a reduction in total plasma tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ des and free fatty acids and an increase in HD@@ L cholesterol levels as well as slightly , but clin@@ ically not significantly increased L@@ DL cholesterol levels were observed .
in clinical trials over a period of up to two years , Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one reduced the total plastic gly@@ c@@ eri@@ des and free fatty acids as compared to placebo , met@@ form@@ in or g@@ lic@@ la@@ cide and increased HD@@ L cholesterol levels .
in comparison to placebo , no statisti@@ cally significant increase in L@@ DL cholesterol was observed under Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one while lower values were observed under met@@ form@@ in and lic@@ enti@@ cul@@ es .
in a study over 20 weeks , Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one reduced not only the in@@ timi@@ dating tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ des but also improved the post@@ den@@ dial increased tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eride levels , this has an effect on tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eride concentrations as well as the h@@ ep@@ atic tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eride level .
in the Pro@@ Active study , a cardiovascular outcome study , 52@@ 38 patients with type 2 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus and pre @-@ existing advanced mac@@ rov@@ ascular disease were random@@ ised into groups who received either pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one or placebo over a period of up to 3.5 years .
after oral application pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one is absorbed quickly , whereby the peak concentrations of un@@ modified Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one in plasma are usually reached 2 hours after application .
on this basis , the contribution of M @-@ IV to effectiveness is equivalent to the triple of the efficacy of pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one whereas the relative effectiveness of M @-@ II is minimal .
in interaction studies it could be proven that pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one does not have a relevant effect on the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics or pharmac@@ o@@ dynamics of di@@ go@@ x@@ in , war@@ far@@ in , phen@@ proc@@ ou@@ mon and met@@ form@@ in .
the simultaneous use of pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one with gem@@ fibro@@ zi@@ l ( a cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8 inhibit@@ or ) or with ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ ine ( a cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8 induc@@ tor ) increases or lowers the plasma concentration of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one ( see section 4.5 ) .
after the or@@ ally application of radio@@ actively marked pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one in humans the marker was found mainly in the f@@ ec@@ es ( 55 % ) and to a lesser extent in urine ( 45 % ) .
the mean plasma @-@ elimination @-@ time of unchanged Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one is 5 @-@ 6 hours in humans , and the total active metabol@@ ites is 16 - 23 hours .
the plasma concentrations of pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one and its metabol@@ ites are lower in patients with reduced kidney function than in healthy volunteers , but the rates of the oral clear@@ ance of the parent substance are similar .
in toxic@@ ological studies occurred in mice , rats , dogs and monkeys after repeated administration of plasma volume enlargement with ha@@ em@@ odi@@ lution , an@@ a@@ emia and reversible ex@@ centric hyper@@ trop@@ hi@@ e .
this is due to the fact that , under treatment with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one , the hyper@@ insul@@ in@@ emia resulting in the gest@@ ation dimin@@ ishes and increases the availability of the metabolic substrates for fet@@ al growth .
in long @-@ term studies ( up to 2 years ) , increased incidence of hyper@@ pl@@ asia ( in male and female rats ) and tumours ( in male rats ) was induced by the ur@@ inary tract epitheli@@ um .
in an animal model of the family aden@@ omat@@ ous poly@@ posi@@ s ( FA@@ P ) , treatment with two other thi@@ az@@ ol@@ d@@ indi@@ ons led to increased frequency of col@@ on tumours .
the tablets are white to whi@@ tish , round , flat and carry on one side the mark &quot; 30 &quot; and on the other hand the inscription &quot; Ac@@ tos . &quot;
the calculated frac@@ ture incidence was 1.@@ 9 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years in patients treated with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one and 1.1 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years in women treated with a comparative medication .
in the Pro@@ Active study , a study of 3.5 years for the study of cardiovascular events , frac@@ tures occurred at 44 / 8@@ 70 ( 5.1 % ; 1.0 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years ) of patients treated with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one , compared with 23 / 9@@ 05 ( 2.5 % ; 0.5 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years ) in patients who were treated with a comparative medication .
in another study over two years the effects of a combination therapy of met@@ form@@ in were investigated with either Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one or G@@ lic@@ la@@ cide .
in clinical studies more than 1 year , a statisti@@ cally significant decrease of alb@@ um@@ in / cre@@ at@@ in@@ ine qu@@ oti@@ ents was statisti@@ cally significant compared to bas@@ eline values .
in a study more than 20 weeks , Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one reduced not only the in@@ timi@@ dating tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ des but also improved post@@ den@@ dial increased tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eride levels , this has an effect on tr@@ y@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ d absorption as well as the h@@ ep@@ atic Tr@@ y@@ g@@ lic@@ eri@@ d synthesis .
although the study was missing the target with regard to its primary end@@ point , which presented a combination of the total mort@@ ality , non @-@ le@@ thal m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction , stroke , acute cor@@ on@@ ary syndrome , leg amp@@ utation above the an@@ kles , cor@@ on@@ ary rev@@ as@@ cul@@ ar@@ isation and re@@ as@@ cul@@ ar@@ isation of the leg arter@@ ies , the results suggest that with the intake of pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one no cardiovascular long @-@ term risks are connected .
the tablets are white to whi@@ tish , round , flat and carry on one side the mark &quot; 45 &quot; and on the other hand the inscription &quot; Ac@@ tos . &quot;
in a summari@@ zing analysis of adverse events regarding bone frac@@ tures from random@@ ised controlled , controlled , double @-@ blind clinical studies over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,@@ 100 patients treated with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one and more than 7,@@ 400 patients receiving comparative medication , there was a increased incidence of frac@@ tures in women .
in the Pro@@ Active study , a study of 3.5 years for the study of cardiovascular events , frac@@ tures occurred at 44 / 8@@ 70 ( 5.1 % ; 1.0 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years ) of patients treated with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one , compared with 23 / 9@@ 05 ( 2.5 % ; 0.5 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years ) in patients who were treated with a comparative medication .

Ac@@ tro@@ ph@@ ane was enrolled in a total of 29@@ 4 patients with type 1 diabetes , in which the pancre@@ as cannot produce insulin , and type 2 diabetes , in which the body is unable to use insulin effectively .
in the study , the concentration of a substance ( gly@@ cos@@ yl@@ ated hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in ( H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) was measured after 12 weeks , indicating how well the blood sugar is set .
Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane resulted in a decrease in the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c level that indicated that the blood sugar levels were similar to another human insulin .
acet@@ ph@@ ane should not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to human insulin ( r@@ DNA ) or any of the other components .
the doses of acet@@ ph@@ ane may also be adapted if it is administered together with a number of other medicines that can affect blood sugar ( the complete list is to be found in the packaging template ) .
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that the benefits of ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane were out@@ weighed in the treatment of diabetes .
in October 2002 , the European Commission issued a permit to the company Nov@@ o Nor@@ disk A / S for the placing of Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane on the entire European Union .
pre@@ mixed insulin products are usually applied once or twice daily , if a rapid initial action is desired along with a longer lasting effect .
the injection needle must be left under the skin for at least 6 seconds to ensure that the entire dose was inj@@ ected .
patients whose blood sugar level has improved significantly , for example , by intensified insulin therapy , can alter hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia warning symptoms and should be advised accordingly .
any change regarding strength , brand ( manufacturer ) , insulin type ( fast acting , bi@@ pha@@ sic , long acting insulin , etc . ) , type of insulin ( animal insulin , insulin analog or insulin analogue ) and / or manufacturing method ( by re@@ combin@@ ant DNA versus insulin @-@ animal origin ) can cause a change in dosage .
if a dose adaptation is necessary when changing to acet@@ ph@@ ane in the patient , it may be necessary at the first dose or in the first weeks or months after the conversion .
some patients with hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic reactions after a change from animal to human insulin reported that early warning symptoms of hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia were less pronounced or unlike their previous insulin .
before travelling , which go over several time zones , the patient should be advised to collect the advice of his doctor as such trips can cause insulin and meals to be applied or taken at other times .
the doctor therefore has to take into account possible interactions during the therapy and always consult his patients according to other medicines they have taken .
4 B@@ oth hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia as well as hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia , which may occur in a not sufficiently controlled diabetes therapy , increase the risk of ab@@ norm@@ alities and fertility in uter@@ o .
severe hypo@@ gly@@ cem@@ ias can lead to un@@ consciousness and / or sei@@ zur@@ es and end with temporary or permanent disorders of the brain function and even death .
diseases of the nervous system Occ@@ a@@ sional - Periph@@ eral neu@@ rop@@ athy A rapid improvement of blood sugar control can be associated with complaints that are called acute painful neu@@ rop@@ athy and are usually reversible .
5 An intensi@@ fication of insulin therapy with an ab@@ rupt improvement in blood sugar level can , however , be associated with a temporary wor@@ sen@@ ing of diabe@@ tic retin@@ opathy .
diseases of the skin and skin tissue - Li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy An injection site can develop li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy if missed to change the punc@@ ture points within the injection area .
local hyper@@ sensitivity reactions ( redness , swelling , it@@ ching , pain and ha@@ em@@ at@@ oma at the injection site ) may occur during insulin therapy .
diseases of the immune system Occ@@ a@@ sional - Ur@@ tic@@ aria , Ex@@ an@@ them Very rare - an@@ ap@@ hy@@ lac@@ tic reactions symptoms of gener@@ alized hyper@@ sensitivity , including gener@@ alized skin rash , it@@ ching , swe@@ ating , gastro@@ intestinal disorders , angi@@ on@@ eur@@ otic o@@ e@@ dem@@ a , breathing difficulties , pal@@ pit@@ ations , low blood pressure and f@@ ain@@ ting / un@@ consciousness .
hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia can , however , gradually develop : • Light hypo@@ gly@@ cem@@ ias can be treated by the oral supply of glucose and sug@@ ary foods .
diabe@@ tics should therefore always have grape sugar , sweets , bis@@ cuits or sugar @-@ containing fruit juice . • Heavy hypo@@ gly@@ cem@@ ias with un@@ consciousness are treated with an intra@@ muscular or sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection of glucose ( 0.5 to 1.0 mg ) by a proven auxiliary person or given by glucose that is given intraven@@ ously by the doctor .
the effect starts within half an hour , the maximum effect is reached within 2 to 8 hours and the total duration of activity is up to 24 hours .
res@@ or@@ ption The absorption profile is based on the fact that the product is a mixture of insulin products with faster or delayed res@@ or@@ ption .
a number of fis@@ sion ( hydro@@ ly@@ sis ) places on the human insulin molecule were considered ; none of the metabol@@ ites formed by the split is active .
based on conventional studies on safety har@@ mac@@ ology , toxic@@ ity in repeated application , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity , carcin@@ ogen@@ ic potential and reproductive toxic@@ ity , prec@@ lin@@ ical data can not detect any particular dangers to humans .

aden@@ ur@@ ic is used in patients showing signs of crystalline deposits , including arthritis ( pain and inflammation in the joints ) or po@@ ison@@ ous nodes ( &quot; stones &quot; ) .
if the ur@@ ic acid levels are still more than 6 mg per dec@@ il@@ iter after two to four weeks , the dose can be increased to 120 mg once a day .
arthritis may still occur during the first treatment months ; therefore , it is recommended that patients with Aden@@ ur@@ ic do not take further medicines at least during the first six months of treatment with aden@@ ur@@ ic .
the medicine is not recommended in children and in patients who had an organ transplan@@ t as it was not examined for these groups .
in the first study involving 1 0@@ 72 patients , the efficacy of three different aden@@ ur@@ ic dos@@ ages ( once daily 80 , 120 and 240 mg ) was compared with the placebo ( placebo ) and alpha pur@@ in@@ ol ( another medicine for the treatment of hyper@@ ur@@ ic@@ a@@ emia ) .
in the second study , two doses of Aden@@ ur@@ ic ( once daily 80 and 120 mg ) were compared with allo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol for one year to 7@@ 62 patients .
in both studies , al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol was used in a dose of once daily 300 mg ; patients with kidney problems received only 100 mg per day .
the main indicator of efficacy was the number of patients whose ur@@ ic acid levels in the blood were below 6 mg / dl in the last three measurements .
in the first study 48 % ( 126 of 26@@ 2 ) of patients receiving Aden@@ ur@@ ic in a dose of once daily 80 mg , and 65 % ( 175 of 26@@ 9 ) of patients who received 120 mg once daily , with the last three measurements a ur@@ ic acid level in the blood of less than 6 mg / dl .
in comparison , this was 22 % ( 60 out of 26@@ 8 ) of the patients under Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol and none of the 134 patients under placebo .
the most common side effects of Aden@@ ur@@ ic ( observed at 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are head@@ aches , diar@@ rho@@ ea , nausea ( nausea ) , rash and abnormal liver enzymes .
in particular in patients with heart problems in the pre@@ history , there may be an increased risk of certain side effects that affect the heart and blood vessels .
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that Aden@@ ur@@ ic was more effective in lowering ur@@ ic acid levels in the blood than al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol , but also a higher risk of side effects associated with the heart and blood vessels .
treatment of chronic hyper@@ ur@@ ic@@ a@@ emia in diseases that have already led to ur@@ inary deposits ( including a current report known from the medical history and / or arthritis ) .
if the serum pole level is still &gt; 6 mg / dl ( 3@@ 57 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) after 2 @-@ 4 weeks , a dose increase on AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 120 mg 1 x can be considered daily .
in patients with severe kidney function restriction , efficacy and safety were not fully investigated until now ( Cre@@ at@@ in@@ in- Clear@@ ance &lt; 30 ml / min , see section 5.2 ) .
since there are no experiences in children and adolescents , the use of F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at in this group of patients is not recommended .
organ transplan@@ t recipients There are no experiences in organ transplan@@ t recipients , the use of F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at is not recommended in this group of patients ( see Section 5.1 ) .
cardiovascular disease In patients with isch@@ em@@ ic heart disease or de@@ compensated heart failure treatment with F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at is not recommended ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) .
as with other di@@ ure@@ tic drugs , acute rheum@@ atism can occur during the treatment beginning , because the reduction of serum acid levels initially mobili@@ zes the acid deposits in the tissue .
B. for malign@@ ant diseases and their treatment ( Les@@ ch@@ - Ny@@ han Syndrome ) the absolute concentration of X@@ an@@ thin in the urine in rare cases is so widespread that it comes to a deposit in the ur@@ inary tract .
liver disease Dur@@ ing phase 3 clinical trials , slight ab@@ norm@@ alities of the liver function were observed in patients treated with F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at ( 3.5 % ) .
it is therefore recommended to carry out a liver function test before the beginning of the bas@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ o@@ stat@@ or treatment ( see Section 5.1 ) .
the@@ ophy@@ ll@@ ine tin did not conduct any interaction studies on F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at , but it is known that the X@@ O in@@ hibition can lead to an increase in the@@ ophy@@ l@@ ism mirror ( an in@@ hibition of the@@ ophy@@ ll@@ ine met@@ abo@@ li@@ zation was also reported for other X@@ O inhibit@@ ors ) .
in subjects the simultaneous administration of F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at and Nap@@ ro@@ xen was associated with an increase in bas@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at exposure ( C@@ max 28 % , AU@@ C 41 % and t@@ 1 / 2 26 % ) .
in clinical studies the application of nap@@ ro@@ xen or other N@@ SA@@ R / Co@@ x @-@ 2 inhibit@@ ors was not related to clin@@ ically significant increase of adverse events .
Col@@ ch@@ ic@@ in / In@@ dom@@ et@@ ac@@ in / Hydro@@ chlor@@ thi@@ azi@@ de / War@@ far@@ in F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at can be used together with col@@ ch@@ ic@@ in or In@@ dom@@ et@@ ac@@ in without a dose adaptation for F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at or the other active ingredient used at the same time .
in a study with study subjects 120 mg AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 1 x showed a moderate 22 % increase in the AU@@ C of Des@@ i@@ pra@@ mine , a C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 substrate , which indicates a possible low inhibit@@ ory effect of F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at on the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 enzyme in vivo .
An@@ ta@@ zi@@ da It could be shown that the simultaneous intake of ant@@ acids containing magnesium hydro@@ xi@@ de and aluminum hydro@@ xi@@ de , delays the absorption of F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at ( around 1 hour ) and a decrease of the C@@ max by 32 % , but no significant change in AU@@ C .
pregnancy data over a very limited number of exposed pregn@@ ancies can not close to side effects of F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at on pregnancy or the health of the fet@@ us / new@@ born .
animal experimental studies do not permit direct or indirect harmful effects on pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development or birth ( see Section 5.3 ) .
patients should be cau@@ tious when controlling a vehicle , operating machines or exercising hazardous activities until they can be reasonably sure that AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC does not adver@@ sely affect their performance .
a numer@@ ically higher incidence of cardiovascular events reported by the investig@@ ator was observed in the total f@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ o@@ stat@@ s in the pi@@ vot@@ al study of phase 3 ( 1.3 versus 0.@@ 7 events per 100 patient years ) , although no statisti@@ cally significant differences were found and no caus@@ al correlation with F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at could be detected .
the risk factors determined in these patients were an arter@@ ios@@ cl@@ erotic condition and / or a m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction or a de@@ compensated cardiac in@@ suffici@@ ency in the medical history .
frequent ( ≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10 ) , occasional ( ≥ 1 / 1000 to &lt; 1 / 100 ) and rare ( ≥ 1 / 1000 to &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) Side effects that could stand in the treatment groups with 80 mg / 120 mg of F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at and which were reported in all F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at treatment groups more than once are listed below .
diar@@ rho@@ ea , nausea and vom@@ iting are more common in patients who are treated with col@@ ch@@ ic@@ in at the same time . * * In clinical trials no severe skin r@@ ashes or severe hyper@@ sensitivity reactions were observed .
7 Open long @-@ term extension studies In the open long @-@ term extension studies , 9@@ 06 patients were treated for up to 1 year , 3@@ 22 patients up to 2 years , 57 patients up to 3 years long and 53 patients up to 4 years with F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at 80 mg / 120 mg .
the events reported during long @-@ term studies were similar to those reported in Phase 3 studies ( see Table 1 ) .
the following treatment @-@ related events were reported in all bas@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ o@@ stat@@ s more than once and occurred in patients who received F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at 80 mg / 120 mg in long @-@ term extension studies ( up to 4 years with an exposure time of &gt; 1,@@ 900 patient years ) , according to the information occasionally .
the following treatment @-@ related events were either not reported at all in pi@@ vot@@ al studies in Phase 3 or with a lower frequency :

ur@@ ic acid is the final product of the pur@@ ine metabolism in humans and is produced as part of the reaction process Hypo@@ x@@ an@@ thin → X@@ an@@ thin → ur@@ ic acid .
F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at is a potent , non @-@ pur@@ ine @-@ selective inhibit@@ or of the X@@ O ( NP @-@ SI@@ x@@ O ) with a K@@ i @-@ value for in vitro @-@ inhibit@@ or , which lies below the nan@@ om@@ ol@@ ar range .
clinical study results The efficacy of AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC has been shown in two pi@@ vot@@ al studies of Phase 3 ( AP@@ EX study and F@@ ACT study as described below ) , which were performed with 1,@@ 8@@ 32 patients with hyper@@ ur@@ ic@@ emia and g@@ out .
the primary efficacy end@@ point was in each study the proportion of patients in which the last three monthly serum levels were &lt; 6.0 mg / dl ( 3@@ 57 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
placebo ( n = 134 ) , AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 80 mg 1 x daily ( n = 26@@ 9 ) , AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 240 mg 1 x daily ( n = 25@@ 8 ) for patients with a serum cre@@ atine value at the beginning of study ( n = 10 ) for patients with a serum cre@@ atine value at the beginning of study of &gt; 1.5 mg / dl and ≤ 2.0 mg / dl .
the AP@@ EX study showed the statisti@@ cally significant superi@@ ority of both the treatment with AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 80 mg 1 x daily and AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 120 mg 1 x daily compared to the treatment with conven@@ tionally used doses of Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol 300 mg ( n = 25@@ 8 ) / 100 mg ( n = 10 ) .
the F@@ ACT study showed a statisti@@ cally significant superi@@ ority in both the treatment with AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 80 mg 1 x daily and AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 120 mg 1 x daily compared to the treatment with the usual dose al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol 300 mg .
patients with serum cre@@ atine values &gt; 1.5 and ≤ 2.0 mg / dl ) or 300 mg 1 x daily ( n = 50@@ 9 ) were summari@@ zed for the analyses . * p &lt; 0,@@ 001 versus Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol , # p &lt; 0,@@ 001 versus 80 mg
lowering the serum acid level to &lt; 6.0 mg / dl ( 3@@ 57 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) was observed during the doctor visit in week 2 and maintained permanently over the entire treatment .
50@@ 9 patients received al@@ loc@@ al@@ in@@ ol 300 mg 1 x daily ; 10 patients with serum cre@@ atine values &gt; 1.5 and &lt; 2.0 mg / dl received 100 mg 1 x daily .
primary end@@ point in the sub@@ group of patients with kidney function restriction The AP@@ EX study evaluated the efficacy of 40 patients with ren@@ al function restriction ( D ) .
AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC was the primary efficacy end@@ point of 44 % ( 80 mg 1 x daily ) , 45 % ( 120 mg 1 x daily ) and 60 % ( 240 mg 1 x daily ) of the patients .
there were no clin@@ ically significant differences in the percentage return of serum acid concentrations in subjects regardless of their kidney function ( 58 % in the group with normal ren@@ al function and 55 % in the group with severe kidney function disorders ) .
primary end@@ point in the sub@@ group of patients with serum acid concentrations ≥ 10 mg / dl of E@@ tw@@ a 40 % of patients ( AP@@ EX and F@@ ACT study ) had a serum acid concentration of ≥ 10 mg / dl at the beginning of study ( bas@@ eline ) .
the data collected in two years of the open extension study in Phase 3 showed that the permanent decrease in serum acid levels to &lt; 6 mg / dl ( &lt; 3@@ 57 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) revealed that less than 3 % of patients in the months of 16 @-@ 24 needed a treatment against a thirst @-@ feed ( i.e. more than 97 % of patients needed no treatment against a g@@ out ) .
this was associated with a reduction in the size of the gre@@ ed k@@ not , which resulted in 54 % of patients a complete disappearance of the lymp@@ h nodes by month 24 .
elevated TS@@ H values ( &gt; 5.5 µ@@ IE / ml ) were observed in patients receiving long @-@ term treatment with F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at ( 5,@@ 0 % ) and also in patients receiving al@@ loc@@ in@@ ol ( 5.@@ 8 % ) in open long @-@ term extension studies ( see section 4.4 ) .
in healthy subjects , the maximum plasma concentrations ( C@@ max ) and the surface under the plasma concentration time curve ( AU@@ C ) increased from F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at after administration of simple and multiple doses of 10 mg to 120 mg dose .
for doses between 120 mg and 300 mg , an increase in AU@@ C is observed for F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at , which is greater than the dose @-@ proportional increase .
after taking simple or multiple oral doses of 80 and 120 mg 1 x daily , the C@@ max is about 2.8 @-@ 3.2 µ@@ g / ml and 5,@@ 0 @-@ 5.@@ 3 µ@@ g / ml .
however , no clin@@ ically significant change was observed in the percentage decrease in serum acid concentration as long as this was tested ( multiple doses of 80 mg ) .
distribution The apparent Ste@@ ady state distribution volume ( V@@ ss / F ) from F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at is in the range from 29 to 75 l after taking doses of 10 @-@ 300 mg .
the plasma protein binding of F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at is about 9@@ 9.@@ 2 % ( primary binding to alb@@ um@@ in ) and is constant over the concentration range , which is reached with doses of 80 and 120 mg .
in vitro studies in human liver micro@@ som@@ ites , these oxid@@ ative metabol@@ ites are mainly formed by C@@ Y@@ P@@ 1@@ A1 , C@@ Y@@ P@@ 1@@ A2 , C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ C@@ 8 or C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ C@@ 9 , and that F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ o@@ stat@@ glu@@ cur@@ on@@ id is produced mainly by U@@ GT 1@@ A1 , 1@@ A@@ 8 and 1@@ A@@ 9 .
after taking an 80 mg dose of 14@@ C @-@ marked F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at , around 49 % of the dose in the urine was found to be unchanged F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at ( 3 % ) , A@@ cy@@ l@@ glu@@ cur@@ on@@ id of the active substance ( 30 % ) , its known oxid@@ ative metabol@@ ites and their con@@ ju@@ gate ( 13 % ) and other unknown metabol@@ ites ( 3 % ) .
in addition to ex@@ cre@@ tion over the urine also about 45 % of the dose in the chair found itself as imm@@ utable F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at ( 12 % ) , A@@ cy@@ l@@ glu@@ cur@@ on@@ id of the active substance ( 1 % ) , the known oxid@@ ative metabol@@ ites and their con@@ ju@@ gate ( 25 % ) as well as other unknown metabol@@ ites ( 7 % ) .
special patient groups of ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency Ac@@ cor@@ ding to taking multiple doses of 80 mg AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC in patients with mild , moderate or severe ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency , the C@@ max of F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at did not change compared to subjects with normal ren@@ al function .
the mean total AU@@ C of F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at increased approximately 1.8 @-@ fold from 7.5 μ g / ml in the group with normal ren@@ al function to 13.@@ 2 μ g / ml in the group with severe kidney function .

age There were no significant changes with regard to the AU@@ C of F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at or its metabol@@ ites after taking multiple oral doses of AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC in older patients compared to younger subjects .
carcin@@ ogen@@ esis , mut@@ agen@@ esis , impairment of fertility In male rats , a statisti@@ cally significant increase of ur@@ inary tumours ( transition cell pap@@ ill@@ omas and carcin@@ omas ) was found only in connection with X@@ an@@ thin stones in the highly dos@@ ed group , with about 11 times the exposure to humans .
these findings are seen as a result of a specific pur@@ ine met@@ abo@@ li@@ zation and urine composition and considered not relevant for clinical use .
it has been found that F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at in oral doses of up to 48 mg / kg / day has no effect on the fertility and reproductive capacity of male and female rats .
in high doses , which were about 3 times the human therapeutic exposure , mat@@ ernal toxic@@ ity occurred which accompanied by lowering the Auf@@ zu@@ cht@@ ower and a develop@@ mental retard@@ ation in the offspring of rats .
ter@@ at@@ ological studies in carrying rats with ex@@ positions , about the 4,@@ 3 @-@ fold and carrying rab@@ bits with ex@@ positions , which are about 13 times the human therapeutic exposure , did not have ter@@ ato@@ genic effects .

21 Open long @-@ term extension studies In the open long @-@ term extension studies , 9@@ 06 patients were treated for up to 1 year , 3@@ 22 patients up to 2 years , 57 patients up to 3 years long and 53 patients up to 4 years with F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at 80 mg / 120 mg .
the primary efficacy end@@ point was in each study the proportion of patients in which the last three monthly serum levels were &lt; 6.0 mg / dl ( 3@@ 57 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
the data collected in two years of the open extension study in Phase 3 showed that the permanent decrease in serum acid levels to &lt; 6 mg / dl ( &lt; 3@@ 57 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) revealed that less than 3 % of patients in the months of 16 @-@ 24 needed a treatment against a thirst @-@ feed ( i.e. more than 97 % of patients needed no treatment against a g@@ out ) .

AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is used for the treatment of oste@@ opor@@ osis ( a disease in which the bones are br@@ ittle ) in women after menop@@ ause , in which there is a risk of low vitamin D levels .
the patient must take the tablet with a full glass of water ( no mineral water ) at least 30 minutes before eating , drinking or taking other medicines ( including ant@@ acids , calcium and vitamin supplements ) .
in order to avoid irritation of the es@@ op@@ hag@@ us , the patient should not lie down until after the first dietary intake of the day , which is at the earliest 30 minutes after taking the tablet .
since al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate and vitamin D@@ 3 are already used separately in medicines approved in the European Union , the company presented data originating from previous studies and published literature .
the company also conducted a study of 35 men and 6@@ 82 post @-@ menop@@ aus@@ al women with oste@@ opor@@ osis in order to demonstrate the efficacy of AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE in terms of increasing vitamin D level .
after a 15 week treatment , the proportion of patients with low vitamin D levels in patients treated with AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE was lower ( 11 % ) than those who received exclusively al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate ( 32 % ) .
the company also presented data that indicates that the al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate dose contained in AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE corresponds exactly to the dose needed to prevent bone loss .
the most common side effects ( observed at 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are head@@ aches , pains of the muscul@@ os@@ kel@@ etal system such as abdominal pain , dy@@ sp@@ ep@@ sia ( digestive disorders ) , con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation , diar@@ rhe@@ a ( diar@@ rhe@@ a ) , flat@@ ul@@ ence ( ul@@ cer@@ a ) of es@@ op@@ hag@@ us , dy@@ sp@@ ha@@ gia ( swal@@ lowing disorders ) , con@@ gest@@ ed abdom@@ en ( blo@@ ated abdom@@ en ) and aci@@ dic sho@@ cks .
AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE may not be used in patients with hyper@@ sensitivity to al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate , vitamin D@@ 3 or any of the other ingredients .
it may not be used in patients with hypo@@ cal@@ c@@ emia ( low calcium levels ) or in patients who cannot stand or sit upright for at least 30 minutes .
in January 2007 , the European Commission issued a permit to the company Mer@@ ck Shar@@ p &amp; Doh@@ a Ltd. for the placing on the market of AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE throughout the European Union .
capsule @-@ shaped , white to broken white tablets , marked with the outline of a bone on one side and &quot; 7@@ 10 &quot; on the other side .
AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is only available with water ( not with mineral water ) at least 30 minutes before the first meal , drink or intake of medicines ( including ant@@ acids , calcium and vitamin supplements ) for the day .
follow these guidelines exactly to reduce the risk of malign@@ ant irritation and associated side effects ( see section 4.4 ) :
• AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE should be swal@@ lowed only with a full glass of water ( at least 200 ml ) after the day . • Pati@@ ents should not ch@@ ew the tablet or leave the tablet in the mouth because there is a risk of or@@ op@@ har@@ yn@@ ge@@ al ul@@ cer@@ a . • Pati@@ ents should not lie before the first dietary intake of the day , which should take place at the earliest 30 minutes after taking the tablet .
B. pe@@ p@@ tic ul@@ c@@ ers , active gastro@@ intestinal ble@@ ed@@ ings or surgical procedures in the upper gastro@@ intestinal tract except p@@ yl@@ or@@ op@@ la@@ sty ( see Section 4.3 ) .
es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al reactions such as es@@ op@@ ha@@ gi@@ tis , malign@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al ul@@ cer@@ a and ös@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al ero@@ sions , rarely followed by malign@@ ant frac@@ tures , were reported in patients under the ing@@ es@@ tion of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate ( some were severe and required hosp@@ itali@@ zation ) .
the doctor should therefore draw attention to all signs and symptoms that may be noted for possible behavi@@ oral reactions , and patients should be advised to susp@@ end the drug and seek medical advice in case of symptoms of ec@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al irritation , such as dy@@ sp@@ ha@@ gia , pain in swal@@ lowing or retro@@ sp@@ ital pain or a new or wor@@ sen@@ ing heart@@ burn ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) .
3 The risk of serious adverse side effects seems to be increased in patients who do not take the medicine correctly and / or continue to take it after the occurrence of symptoms that refer to an es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al irritation .
it is very important that all dosage instructions are passed on to the patient and understood by the patient ( see section 4.2 ) .
while in large @-@ scale clinical studies with Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at no increased risk was detected , ga@@ stri@@ c and du@@ oden@@ al ul@@ cer@@ ations were rarely reported ( after market launch ) , including some severe and severe complications ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) .
oste@@ o@@ arthritis of the jaw , usually associated with a tooth extraction and / or a local infection ( including oste@@ om@@ y@@ eli@@ tis ) , was reported in cancer patients whose treatment regi@@ men contains mainly intraven@@ ous bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate .
there are no data available that indicate whether the use of a bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate therapy in patients who require a ortho@@ don@@ tic operation reduces the risk of oste@@ o@@ arthritis of the jaw .
the clinical evaluation by the treating physician is decisive for the treatment planning in each patient based on an individual benefit @-@ risk assessment .
patients should be instructed that they should take the tablet next morning when taking a dose of AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE after taking notice of their om@@ is@@ sion .
you should not take two tablets the same day , but continue taking one tablet per week as planned at the planned week@@ day .
other diseases affecting the metabolism ( such as vitamin D deficiency and hyp@@ op@@ ar@@ ath@@ y@@ re@@ oi@@ dis@@ m ) should also be adequately addressed before starting therapy with AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE .
al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate foods and beverages ( including mineral water ) , calcium supplements , ant@@ acids and some oral medicines may affect the res@@ or@@ ption of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate when taken at the same time .
therefore , after taking Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at , patients must wait at least 30 minutes before taking other medicines ( see Sec@@ tions 4.2 and 5.2 ) .
although specific interaction studies were not carried out , Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at was taken in clinical trials together with a variety of commonly prescribed drugs without clin@@ ically relevant interactions .
AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is only intended for use in post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women and is therefore not applicable during pregnancy or lac@@ t@@ ating women .
animal studies with al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate do not indicate direct harmful effects with regard to pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al or post@@ nat@@ al development .
oste@@ o@@ arthritis of the jaw was reported in patients under bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate ; most reports stem from cancer patients , but it was also reported in oste@@ opor@@ osis patients .
nevertheless , the serum calcium intake was up to &lt; 8.@@ 0 mg / dl ( 2.0 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and serum phosph@@ ats up to ≤ 2.0 mg / dl ( 0.@@ 65 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) in both treatment groups with similar frequency .
al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate In@@ sequence of an oral over@@ dose may occur hypo@@ cal@@ c@@ emia , hyp@@ oph@@ osph@@ at@@ emia , and side effects in the upper gastro@@ intestinal tract such as stomach upset , heart@@ burn , o@@ es@@ ha@@ gi@@ tis , ga@@ stri@@ tis or ul@@ cer@@ a .
col@@ ec@@ al@@ ci@@ fer@@ ol ( vitamin D@@ 3 ) Vitamin D@@ 3 is produced in the skin by UV light over the conversion of 7 de@@ hydro@@ xi@@ de to vitamin D@@ 3 .
the main effect of 1.@@ 25 @-@ D@@ ih@@ y@@ dro@@ xy@@ vitamin D@@ 3 is to increase the intestinal absorption of calcium and phosph@@ ate as well as the regulation of serum calcium , the ren@@ al elimination of calcium and phosph@@ ate , bone formation and bone res@@ or@@ ption .
in severe cases , a deficiency of secondary hyper@@ par@@ ath@@ y@@ re@@ oi@@ dis@@ m , hyp@@ oph@@ osph@@ at@@ a@@ emia , weakness of proxim@@ al muscul@@ ature and oste@@ om@@ al@@ acia can lead to a further increased risk of falls and frac@@ tures in oste@@ opor@@ otic individuals .

patients received AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE in the lower thickness ( 70 mg / 2,@@ 800 I.@@ U. ) ( n = 350 ) or Fos@@ am@@ ax ( Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at ) 70 mg once a week ( n = 3@@ 32 ) ; further vitamin D supplements were forbidden .
after 15 @-@ week treatment , the average serum levels of 25 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ pro@@ vitamin D were significantly higher ( 26 % ) in the group under AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE ( 70 mg / 2,@@ 800 I.@@ U. ) ( 56 n@@ mo@@ l / l &#91; 23 ng / ml &#93; ) than in the group under Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at alone ( 46 n@@ mo@@ l / l &#91; 18.@@ 2 ng / ml &#93; ) .
AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE ( 70 mg / 2,@@ 800 I.@@ U. ) reduced significantly after 15 weeks the proportion of patients with vitamin D in@@ suffici@@ ency ( serum value of 25 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ lic D &lt; 37@@ ,5 n@@ mo@@ l / l &#91; &lt; 15 ng / ml &#93; ) by 6@@ 2.5 % compared to Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at alone ( 12 % vs .
the therapeutic equilibrium of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate once weekly 70 mg ( n = 5@@ 19 ) and al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate 10 mg daily ( n = 370 ) was demonstrated in a one @-@ year multi @-@ center study of post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women with oste@@ opor@@ osis .
the effects of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate on bone mass and frac@@ ture in post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women were studied in two phase III studies of identical design ( n = 9@@ 44 ) as well as in the frac@@ ture intervention trial ( F@@ IT : n = 6.@@ 4@@ 59 ) .
in the phase III studies , the middle asc@@ ents of the BM@@ D with al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate 10 mg / day compared to placebo after 3 years 8.@@ 8 % at the spine , 5.@@ 9 % at the fem@@ ur and 7.@@ 8 % at the tro@@ chan@@ ter .
in the group treated with Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at , a reduction of 48 % ( Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at 3.2 % versus placebo + 6.2 % ) was achieved in the proportion of patients who suffered one or more verteb@@ rate frac@@ tures .
in the two @-@ year extension of these studies the asc@@ ents of the BM@@ D of the spine and tro@@ chan@@ ter continued to stop ; also the BM@@ D of the fem@@ ur and the entire body was maintained .
it consisted of two placebo @-@ controlled trials in which al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate daily ( 5 mg daily for 2 years and then 10 mg daily continued to be taken either over 1 or 2 years ) :
in this study , Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate &apos;s daily administration reduced the incidence of at least one new ed@@ dy frac@@ ture by 47 % ( Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at 7.@@ 9 % versus placebo 15.@@ 0 % ) .
res@@ or@@ ption Appl@@ ying on an intraven@@ ous reference dose was the average oral bio@@ availability of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate in women 0.@@ 64 % for doses between 5 and 70 mg after noc@@ tur@@ nal fast and two hours before receiving a standardized breakfast .
bio@@ availability decreased to about 0.@@ 46 % and 0.@@ 39 % when Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at was taken half an hour before a standardised breakfast .
in oste@@ opor@@ osis the Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate was effective if it was taken at least 30 minutes before the first meal or drink of the day .
in healthy volunteers , oral pre@@ d@@ nis@@ one ( 20 mg three times daily over five days ) did not lead to clin@@ ically significant changes in the oral bio@@ availability of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate ( increase in average from 20 % to 44 % ) .
9 distribution studies on rats have shown that after intraven@@ ous administration of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate , al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate is temporarily distributed in tissue tissues after intraven@@ ous administration of 1 mg / kg , but then quickly disper@@ sed into the bone or ex@@ cre@@ ted with the urine .
after intraven@@ ous administration of a single dose of 14@@ C @-@ Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at approximately 50 % of the radio@@ actively marked substance were ex@@ cre@@ ted within 72 hours with the urine and little or no radio@@ activity was found in the f@@ ec@@ es .
after intraven@@ ous administration of a single dose of 10 mg , the ren@@ al clearance of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate 71 ml / min and systemic clearance did not exceed 200 ml / min .
al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate is not ex@@ cre@@ ted by the acid or alkal@@ ine transport system of the kidneys and therefore it is not assumed that it affects the ex@@ cre@@ tion of other medicines by these transport systems .

the mean maximum concentration in serum ( C@@ max ) of vitamin D@@ 3 was 5.@@ 9 ng / ml and the medi@@ an time until reaching the maximum serum concentration ( T@@ max ) 12 hours .
in the liver , biot@@ ech formation of vitamin D@@ 3 is rapidly hydro@@ xy@@ cy@@ tic in the liver and then metabol@@ ised in the kidney to 1.@@ 25 @-@ D@@ ih@@ y@@ dro@@ xy@@ vitamin D@@ 3 , the bi@@ ologically active form .
ex@@ cre@@ tion In the case of a combination of radio@@ actively marked vitamin D@@ 3 in healthy volunteers , the mean ex@@ cre@@ tion of radio@@ activity in the urine amounted to 2.4 % in the urine after 4 days 4.@@ 9 % .
characteristics in patients with prec@@ lin@@ ical studies have shown that the proportion of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate , which is not deposited in the bone , is quickly ex@@ cre@@ ted via the urine .
although there are no clinical data about it , it is nevertheless to be expected that the ren@@ al elimination of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate as in animal experiments is also reduced in patients with reduced kidney function .
therefore , in patients with reduced kidney function , a slightly increased accumulation of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate in bone is expected ( see section 4.2 ) .
Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at non @-@ clinical data based on conventional studies on safety har@@ mac@@ ology , chronic toxic@@ ity , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity and carcin@@ ogen@@ ic potential do not reveal any particular dangers to humans .

advice is given to adult patients who have been transplan@@ ted to kidney or liver to prevent the transplan@@ ted organ from being re@@ pul@@ sed by the immune system .
as Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus and Pro@@ gra@@ f / Pro@@ gra@@ ft are already used in the EU , the company has submitted the results from previous studies with Pro@@ gra@@ f / Pro@@ gra@@ ft as well as data from published literature .
furthermore , the results of a clinical study were submitted to 6@@ 68 patients with kidney transplantation , compared with Pro@@ gra@@ f / Pro@@ gra@@ ft or C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in .
the main indicator of efficacy was the number of patients in which the transplan@@ t was rep@@ elled after a period of one year ( for example , by examining how often a renewed organ transplan@@ t or resum@@ ption of di@@ aly@@ sis was required ) .
in addition , shorter further studies were carried out on 119 patients with kidney transplantation and 129 patients with liver transplan@@ t and examined how adv@@ agra@@ f is absorbed by the body in comparison to Pro@@ gra@@ f / Pro@@ gra@@ ft .
tre@@ mor , headache , nausea , vom@@ iting , diar@@ rhe@@ a ( diar@@ rho@@ ea ) , kidney problems , increased blood sugar levels ( hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia ) , diabetes , increased potassium content ( hypertension ) and in@@ som@@ nia ( in@@ som@@ nia ) .
for patients with any hyper@@ sensitivity ( allergy ) against tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , macro@@ li@@ de antibiotics ( such as er@@ y@@ thro@@ my@@ cin ) or any of the other ingredients , adv@@ agra@@ f may not be applied .
patients and doctors must be cau@@ tious if other ( especially some herbal ) drugs are taken at the same time with adv@@ agra@@ f , as the adult dose or dose of the medication taken at the same time needs to be adjusted accordingly .
hard capsules , ret@@ ar@@ ded yellow @-@ orange gel capsules , printed in red ink on the light yellow cap@@ s@@ ular surface with &quot; 0.5 mg &quot; and on the orange capsule bottom with &quot; 1600 &quot; ; they contain white powder .
only physicians who are familiar with immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy and treatment of transplan@@ t patients should prescri@@ be this medicine or make changes in immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy .
due to clin@@ ically relevant differences in systemic exposure of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , this can lead to gra@@ ft rejection or increased incidence of side effects , including under@@ - or over@@ immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression .
patients should always maintain the same Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus formulation and the corresponding daily dosage ; changes to the formulation or ré@@ gi@@ me should only be carried out under close @-@ mes@@ h@@ ed control of a physician experienced in the transplantation ( see Sec@@ tions 4.4 and 4.@@ 8 ) .
as a result of a conversion to an alternative formulation , a therapeutic drug monitoring and appropriate dose adaptation must be carried out to ensure that the systemic exposure of Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus is maintained .
the dosage of Adv@@ agra@@ f should be based primarily on clinical assessment of rejection and toler@@ ability in individual cases and on blood level provisions ( see below &quot; Recommen@@ dations &quot; )
after switching from Pro@@ gra@@ f to Adv@@ agra@@ f , the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus Tal@@ mirrors should be controlled before switching and over two weeks after conversion .
on Day 4 , systemic exposure , measured as a level mirror , was comparable with both kidney and liver transplan@@ ted patients .
careful and repeated checks of the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus Tal@@ mirrors are recommended during the first two weeks after transplan@@ t under adv@@ agra@@ ph to ensure proper substance exposure in the immediate post @-@ transplan@@ t phase .
as tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus is a low @-@ clearing substance , an adaptation of the an@@ agra@@ f can take several days until the Ste@@ ady State is reached .
if the patient &apos;s condition in the first postoperative period does not allow oral consumption of medicines , the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus treatment can be administered intraven@@ ously ( Pro@@ gra@@ f 5 mg / ml concentrate to produce an in@@ fusion solution ) with a dose of ca .
duration of the application To supp@@ ress transplan@@ t rejection , immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression must be maintained ; consequently , a maximum duration of oral therapy cannot be indicated .
dosage recommendations - kidney transplantation pro@@ phyla@@ xis of gra@@ ft rejection The oral Adv@@ ance therapy should start at 0.@@ 20 - 0.@@ 30 mg / kg / day as once daily gift in the morning .
further dosage adjustments may be necessary later , as the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus can change during the course of the patient &apos;s stabil@@ isation after the transplan@@ t .
dosage recommendations - liver transplan@@ t pro@@ phyla@@ xis of gra@@ ft rejection The oral Adv@@ ance therapy should start at 0.@@ 10 - 0.@@ 20 mg / kg / day as once daily gift in the morning .
dosage recommendation - switching from Pro@@ gra@@ f to Adv@@ agra@@ f M@@ ust a gra@@ ft of twice daily dose of Pro@@ gra@@ f capsules must be converted to a daily intake of Adv@@ agra@@ f , so this conversion has to take place in ratio 1 : 1 ( mg : mg ) , related to the entire daily dose .
ren@@ al and liver transplan@@ t After switching from other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ si@@ va to adv@@ agra@@ f once daily , the treatment with the oral initi@@ al@@ dosage recommended in kidney and liver transplan@@ ts should begin with the pro@@ phyla@@ xis of gra@@ ft rejection .
heart transplan@@ t In adult patients who are converted to adv@@ agra@@ ph , an oral initial dose of 0.@@ 15 mg / kg / day is taken once a day in the morning .
other gra@@ ft recipients , although there are no clinical experience with Adv@@ agra@@ f in pul@@ mon@@ ary , pancre@@ atic and ec@@ tal transplan@@ ted patients , received an oral initial dose of 0.@@ 10 - 0.@@ 15 mg / kg / day and in an oral initial dose of 0.3 mg / kg / day and in an oral initial dose of 0.3 mg / kg / day .
dose adjustments in specific patient groups Pati@@ ents with reduced h@@ ep@@ atic function In order to maintain blood tal mirr@@ oring in the targeted area , a reduction in the dose can be required in patients with severe liver dys@@ functions .
patients with reduced kidney function As the kidney function does not affect the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , it can be assumed that dose adaptation is not required .
however , due to the ne@@ phr@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic potential of Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , careful monitoring of the ren@@ al function ( including a regular determination of the serum cre@@ atine @-@ level , a calculation of the in@@ im@@ inary system and a monitoring of the ur@@ inary volume ) is recommended .
switch from C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in to Adv@@ agra@@ f When switching from a C@@ ic@@ los@@ port to a Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus @-@ based therapy , caution is required ( see Sec@@ tions 4.4 and 4.5 ) .
the dose should be based primarily on clinical assessment of rejection and toler@@ ability in individual cases with the use of full blood tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus @-@ level mirror controls .
it is recommended to carry out frequent checks of the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus Tal@@ mirrors during the first two weeks after transplantation , followed by periodi@@ c checks during maintenance therapy .
Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus &apos;s blood @-@ talent levels should also be controlled after switching from Pro@@ gra@@ f to adv@@ agra@@ ph , dose adjustment , immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy , or simultaneous use of substances that might alter the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus full blood concentration ( see Section 4.5 ) .
since adv@@ agra@@ f is a medicine with a low clearance , modifications of the dose may require several days until the Ste@@ ady State has entered .
clinical trials suggest that successful treatment is possible in most cases if the levels of the valley do not exceed 20 ng / ml .
in clinical practice , the levels of Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus in thorou@@ gh@@ bred in the first time after liver transplantation are usually in the range of 5 - 20 ng / ml and for kidney and heart transplan@@ ted patients at 10 - 20 ng / ml .
during the subsequent maintenance therapy of liver , kidney and heart transplan@@ ts , blood concentrations in the range of 5 - 15 ng / ml were generally used .
this has led to serious adverse events , including gra@@ ft rejection or other side effects that may occur as a result of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus or over@@ exposure .
patients should always maintain the same Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus formulation and the corresponding daily dosage ; changes to the formulation or ré@@ gi@@ me should only be carried out under close @-@ mes@@ h@@ ed control of a physician experienced in the transplantation ( see Sec@@ tions 4.2 and 4.@@ 8 ) .
5 In order to treat adult patients with gra@@ ft rejection , which proved to be an immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive agent than other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ si@@ va , no clinical data for the ret@@ ar@@ ded formulation Adv@@ agra@@ f are not yet available .
there are no clinical data for the ret@@ ar@@ ded formulation of Adv@@ agra@@ f for the prevention of gra@@ ft rejection in adult heart transplan@@ ts and transplan@@ t recipients in childhood .
because of possible interactions which may lead to a reduction in the tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus levels in the blood and a weak@@ ening of the clinical effect of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , the intake of herbal supplements containing St. John &apos;s wort ( Hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) or other plant remedies during treatment with adv@@ agra@@ ph ( see Section 4.5 ) .
patients with diar@@ rho@@ ea have a particularly careful monitoring of the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus concentrations in the blood , as the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus blood levels can be subject to considerable variations in such circumstances .
in rare cases a chamber or sep@@ tum hyper@@ tro@@ phy called cardi@@ om@@ y@@ opathy was observed under Pro@@ gra@@ f , which can therefore occur also under Adv@@ agra@@ ph .
other factors that increase the risk of such clinical interference are an already existing heart disease , a treatment with cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids , high blood pressure , kidney or liver dys@@ functions , infections , fluid over@@ loading and o@@ e@@ dem@@ a .
as with other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ants , exposure to sunlight or UV light should be reduced due to the possible risk of malign@@ ant skin lesi@@ ons by appropriate clothing or use of a sun protection agent with a high protection factor .
when patients taking Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , symptoms of PRE@@ S like head@@ aches , altered states of consciousness , conv@@ ul@@ sions and blur@@ red vision , a radi@@ ological examination ( e.@@ g .
since adv@@ agra@@ f contains hard capsules , ret@@ ar@@ ated , lac@@ tose , special caution is required in patients with rare her@@ edi@@ tary gal@@ act@@ ose intoler@@ ance , lac@@ t@@ ase deficiency or glucose @-@ gal@@ act@@ ose @-@ mal@@ absorption .
the simultaneous use of medicines or herbal remedies known as inhibit@@ ors or induc@@ tors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 can affect the metabolism of Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus and thus increase or decrease the blood levels of Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus .
it is therefore recommended to monitor the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus levels while simultaneously offering substances that can alter the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3A metabolism and adjust the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus dose for maintaining uniform concentrations ( see Sec@@ tions 4.2 and 4.4 ) .
a strongly pronounced interaction has been associated with an@@ tim@@ y@@ k@@ oti@@ ka such as k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole , flu@@ con@@ az@@ ol , it@@ tra@@ con@@ az@@ ole and v@@ ori@@ con@@ az@@ ole as well as with the Macro@@ lid antibiotic er@@ y@@ thro@@ my@@ cin and HIV prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors ( z .
pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic studies showed that the increase in blood levels mainly results from the increased oral bio@@ availability of Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus due to the in@@ hibition of gastro@@ intestinal metabolism .
highly dos@@ ed pre@@ d@@ nis@@ ol@@ one or meth@@ yl@@ pre@@ d@@ nis@@ ol@@ one , as used in acute rejection reactions , can increase or decrease the concentration of Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus in the blood .
tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus effect on the metabolism of other medicines Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus is known as C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ or ; therefore , the simultaneous use of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus with medicines which are met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed by C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 can affect their metabolism .
as tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus can reduce the Clear@@ ance of ster@@ oid contrac@@ ep@@ tives and thus increase hormone levels , it is particularly pru@@ dent to proceed with decisions regarding contrac@@ ep@@ tive measures .
the results of animal studies have shown that tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus can potentially reduce the clearance of pent@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al and phen@@ az@@ one and can pro@@ long their half @-@ life .
the results of a small number of transplan@@ t patients have no indication that under tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , compared to other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ants , there is an increased risk of adverse events with regard to the course and outcome of pregnancy .
in uter@@ o exposure , a monitoring of the new@@ born is recommended for any adverse effects of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus ( especially regarding its effects on the kidneys ) .
there is the risk of premature birth ( &lt; week 37 ) and a hyper@@ kal@@ emia of the new@@ born ( incidence 8 of 111 new@@ bor@@ ns ) , i.e. :
the side effect profile of immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ si@@ va can often not be determined precisely because of the size of the patient and the simultaneous treatment with a variety of other medicines .
in the following , the side effects are listed according to their frequency in descending order : very common ( ≥ 1 / 100 , ≤ 1 / 100 ) , occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1000 , ≤ 1 / 1000 ) , very rare ( ≤ 1 / 10,000 , ≤ 1 / 1000 ) , very rare ( frequency based on available data is not inv@@ alu@@ able ) .

infections and par@@ asi@@ tic diseases such as other highly effective immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ants are often increased in patients treated with tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , suscep@@ ti@@ bility to infections ( viral , bacterial , my@@ cot@@ ic , proto@@ zo@@ a ) .
cases of BK @-@ Virus associated ne@@ ph@@ rop@@ athy and J@@ C virus associated progressive multi@@ focal leu@@ ko@@ en@@ cephal@@ opathy ( P@@ ML ) were reported in patients under immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression therapy , including therapy with adv@@ agra@@ f .
it was reported about ben@@ ign or malign@@ ant ne@@ oplas@@ ma including EB@@ V@@ - associated lymp@@ ho@@ prolifer@@ ative diseases and skin tumours in conjunction with the treatment with Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus .
due to its high molecular weight , low water solu@@ bility and high binding of er@@ y@@ thro@@ cytes and plasma rot@@ eins , it can be assumed that tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus is not di@@ aly@@ zable .
mechanism of action and pharmac@@ o@@ dynamic effects on a molecular level are likely to medi@@ ate the effects of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus through its binding to a cy@@ tos@@ ol protein ( F@@ KB@@ P@@ 12 ) , which is responsible for the enrich@@ ment of the link in the cell inn@@ s .
this leads to cal@@ ci@@ um@@ dependent in@@ hibition of signal trans@@ duction path@@ ways in the T cell , thereby preventing the tran@@ scription of a certain number of lymp@@ ho@@ kin genes .
tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus supp@@ resses the activation of T cells and the proliferation of B cells dependent on T @-@ hel@@ per cells , further the formation of lymp@@ ho@@ cytes ( such as inter@@ leu@@ kin @-@ 2 , inter@@ leu@@ kin @-@ 3 and γ @-@ interfer@@ on ) as well as the expression of the inter@@ leu@@ kin @-@ 2 receptor .

analysis of lung transplantation in an interim analysis of a recently conducted , multi@@ center study with oral pro@@ gra@@ f was reported to over 110 patients who received 1 : 1 random@@ isation either Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus or C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in .
chronic transplan@@ t rejection , the bron@@ chi@@ o@@ litis of obl@@ iter@@ ative syndrome , was less frequent in the first year after transplantation ( 2.@@ 86 % versus 8.@@ 57 % ) .
the survival rate after one year was 8@@ 0.8 % in the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus and 83 % in the C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in Group ( Tre@@ ede et al . , 3rd IC@@ I San Diego , USA , 2004 ; Abstract 22 ) .
patients treated with Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus came to 21.@@ 7 % of the cases to develop a bron@@ chi@@ o@@ litis of obl@@ iter@@ ans compared to 3@@ 8.@@ 0 % in C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( p = 0.0@@ 25 ) .
the number of cases in which C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in had to be changed to tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus ( n = 0.@@ 02 ) was significantly greater ( p = 0.@@ 02 ) than the number of patients who were converted from Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus to C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( n = 2 ) ( Ke@@ en@@ an et al . , An@@ n Thor@@ ac@@ ic Sur@@ g 1995 ; 60 : 5@@ 80 ) .
the number of cases in which there was no acute rejection was 6 months ( 5@@ 7.@@ 7 % versus 4@@ 5.@@ 8 % ) and after 1 year ( 50 % versus 3@@ 3.3 % ) in the treatment transplan@@ ted patients of the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus Group ( Tre@@ ede et al . , J Heart L@@ ung Transplan@@ t 2001 ; 20 : 5@@ 11 ) .
in one study , the incidence of a bron@@ chi@@ o@@ litis of obl@@ iter@@ ative syndrome in patients treated with Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus was significantly lower .
a multi@@ center study with oral pro@@ gra@@ f was performed on 205 patients undergoing a pancre@@ atic and ren@@ al transplantation which , after a random@@ ised procedure , received Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus ( n = 103 ) or C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( n = 102 ) .
the oral initi@@ al@@ dosage ( via protocol ) of Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus was 0.2 mg / kg / day and was subsequently reached for reaching the target level of 8 to 15 ng / ml of 5 .
intestinal transplan@@ t The published clinical results of a mono@@ centric study with oral pro@@ gra@@ f as primary immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive after intestinal transplan@@ ts showed an updated survival rate of 75 % after 1 year , 5 % after 5 years and 42 % after 10 years .

factors such as a low ha@@ em@@ ato@@ cri@@ t and low protein concentrations leading to an increase in the un@@ bound fraction of Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , or a strengthening of the metabolism caused by cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids , should be responsible for the higher clearance rates observed after transplantation .
this suggests that Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus is almost completely metabol@@ ised before ex@@ cre@@ tion , whereby the ex@@ cre@@ tion occurs mainly via the bile .
the systemic exposure of Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus ( AU@@ C@@ 0 @-@ 24 ) was approximately 10 % lower than Pro@@ gra@@ f in stable patients ( once daily ) in relation 1 : 1 ( mg : mg ) compared to the total daily dose .
it is recommended to carry out frequent checks of the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus Tal@@ mirrors during the first two weeks after transplantation , followed by periodi@@ c checks during maintenance therapy .

advice is used to treat and prevent bleeding in patients with ha@@ em@@ ophi@@ lia A ( caused by the lack of factor VI@@ II caused by con@@ genital blood cl@@ ot@@ ting disorder ) .
the dose and frequency of the application depend on whether it is used to treat bleeding or to prevent bleeding in surgical procedures .
patients with ha@@ em@@ ophi@@ lia A suffer from a factor VI@@ II deficiency , which causes blood cl@@ ot@@ ting problems such as bleeding in joints , muscles or internal organs .
Oc@@ to@@ co@@ g al@@ fa is not extracted from human plasma but produced by a method called re@@ combin@@ ant DNA technology :
it is produced by a cell in which a gene ( DNA ) was introduced that enables it to form the human cran@@ ial factor VI@@ II .
lawyers are similar to another in the European Union called Rec@@ om@@ bin@@ ate , but is made differently so that the medicine does not contain proteins of human or animal origin .
in three additional studies of patients with severe to moderate hem@@ ophi@@ lia A , including a study of 53 children under six years , the use of the drug was investigated for the prevention of bleeding and surgical procedures .
in the main study the efficacy of Adv@@ ate in the prevention of bleeding in 86 % of 5@@ 10 new blood disease episodes was awarded with &quot; excellent &quot; or &quot; good . &quot;
the most common side effects of lawyers ( observed at 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are di@@ zz@@ iness , head@@ aches , py@@ re@@ x@@ ia ( fever ) and the formation of antibodies against Factor VI@@ II .
lawyers may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to the human co@@ ag@@ ulation factor VI@@ II , mouse or ham@@ ster protein , or any of the other ingredients .
in March 2004 , the European Commission issued a permit to the company Ba@@ x@@ ter AG for the placing of lawyers in the entire European Union .
dosage The dosage and duration of the sub@@ stitution therapy depend on the sever@@ ity of the Factor VI@@ II deficiency , on the location and the extent of the bleeding and clinical condition of the patient .
in the following hem@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ gic events , the Factor VI@@ II activity should not fall below the indicated plasma levels ( in % of the standard or I.@@ E. / dl ) .
injection all 12 @-@ 24 hours ( 8 @-@ 24 hours in patients under 6 years ) repeat for 3 @-@ 4 days or longer until the pain and acute impairment are removed .
injection all 8 @-@ 24 hours ( 6 @-@ 12 hours in patients under 6 years ) repeat until the risk is over for the patient .
during the treatment course , appropriate determination of the Factor VI@@ II plasma is recommended for the control of the dose and frequency of the inj@@ ections .
individual patients can differ in their reaction to Factor VI@@ II , achieve different in vivo recovery and exhibit different half @-@ times .
3 Pro@@ phyla@@ xis for long @-@ term pro@@ phyla@@ xis of bleeding in patients with severe ha@@ em@@ ophi@@ lia A should be given doses between 20 and 40 I.@@ U. of factor VI@@ II per kg body weight at a distance of 2 @-@ 3 days .
if the expected Factor VI@@ II plasma activity is not reached or if the bleeding is not controlled with a reasonable dose , a test must be carried out in order to prove an inhibit@@ or if necessary .
in patients with high inhibit@@ or values , it is possible that the Factor VI@@ II @-@ therapy is not effective , so that other therapeutic measures must be considered .
the dosage speed should be directed after the patient is found , with a maximum injection rate of 10 ml / min not to be exceeded .
the formation of neutr@@ alizing antibodies against Factor VI@@ II is a known complic@@ ation in the treatment of patients with ha@@ em@@ ophi@@ lia A .
these inhibit@@ ors are always against the pro@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ atory activity of factor VI@@ II directed Ig@@ G immun@@ o@@ glob@@ ul@@ ins , which are quanti@@ fied in Be@@ thes@@ da units ( B.@@ E. ) per ml plasma using modified Be@@ thes@@ da As@@ say .
the risk of developing inhibit@@ ors cor@@ relates with the extent of exposure to Factor VI@@ II , whereby risk within the first 20 ex@@ positions is the largest and depends on genetic and other factors .
in pre @-@ treated patients ( PT@@ Ps ) with more than 100 re@@ posi@@ tional days and an am@@ n@@ estic known inhibit@@ or development , after switching from a re@@ combin@@ ant Factor VI@@ II @-@ product to another , the recur@@ rence of ( low @-@ tri@@ gen ) inhibit@@ ors was observed .
due to the rare occurrence of ha@@ em@@ ophi@@ lia A among women , the use of Factor VI@@ II during pregnancy and lac@@ tation is not an experience .
A@@ DR@@ s were inhibit@@ ors against Factor VI@@ II ( 5 patients ) who had a higher risk of inhibit@@ ing inhibit@@ ors , head@@ aches ( 5 patients ) , fever and di@@ zz@@ iness ( 3 patients each ) .
very common ( ≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10 ) , occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1000 to &lt; 1 / 100 ) , rarely ( ≥ 1 / 1000 to &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) , rarely known ( frequency based on available data cannot be estimated ) .
a ) The percentage of patients was calculated on the basis of the sum of the individual patients ( 2@@ 34 ) . the unexpected drop in blood cl@@ ot@@ ting factor VI@@ II was observed post@@ oper@@ atively ( 10th - 14th postoperative day ) in a patient under continuous A@@ DV@@ AT@@ E in@@ fusion .
blood cl@@ ot@@ ting was maintained throughout the period and both the Factor VI@@ II@@ - Mir@@ ror in the Plasma and the Clear@@ ance Rate again showed sufficient levels on the 15th postoperative day .
in clinical studies with A@@ DV@@ AT@@ E in 145 children and adults 2 with diagnosed severe to moderate hem@@ ophi@@ lia A ( F@@ VI@@ II ≤ 2 % ) and previous exposure to Factor VI@@ II concentr@@ ates ( ≥ 150 days ) only one patient showed a low inhibit@@ or ( 2.4 B.@@ E. in modified Be@@ thes@@ da approach ) after 26 ex@@ positions .
in addition , none of the 53 pa@@ edi@@ atric patients with an age of under 6 years and diagnosed severe to moderate hem@@ ophi@@ lia A ( F@@ VI@@ II ≤ 2 % ) after previous exposure to Factor VI@@ II@@ - concentr@@ ates ( ≥ 50 days ) found a F@@ VI@@ II inhibit@@ or .
in previously untreated patients , 5 out of 25 ( 20 % ) patients treated with A@@ DV@@ AT@@ E were inhibit@@ ors against Factor VI@@ II .
the immune response of patients to traces of contam@@ in@@ ating proteins was analysed by investigating the antibody ti@@ ters against these proteins , laboratory parameters and reported side effects .
one patient showed both a statisti@@ cally significant upward trend as well as a sustained peak of the antibody @-@ level against anti @-@ CH@@ O cell protein , otherwise there were no signs or symptoms that indicated an allergic reaction or hyper@@ sensitivity .
four patients were reported to have reported on the occurrence of ur@@ tic@@ aria , pr@@ ur@@ itus , skin rash and increased number of e@@ os@@ in@@ op@@ hil@@ er gran@@ u@@ lo@@ cytes in several repeated product ex@@ positions within the study .
7 As with other intraven@@ ous products , A@@ DV@@ AT@@ E reports hyper@@ sensitivity reactions of the allergic type , including an@@ ap@@ hy@@ lac@@ tic / an@@ ap@@ hy@@ lac@@ to@@ i@@ des reactions ( frequency not known ) .
the activated factor VI@@ II acts as a co @-@ actor for the activated factor IX and acceler@@ ates the formation of factor X activated by factor X .
all pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic studies with A@@ DV@@ AT@@ E were performed on pre @-@ treated patients with severe or moderate hem@@ ophi@@ lia A ( bas@@ eline factor VI@@ II activity ≤ 2 % ) .
pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic parameters come from a cross @-@ over study with A@@ DV@@ AT@@ E in 100 previously treated patients equal to or &gt; 10 years and are listed in table 3 below .

based on the data available since the initial authorisation , the CH@@ MP has continued to evaluate the benefit @-@ risk assessment as positive , but considered that the safety profile must be closely monitored for the following reasons :
therefore , on the basis of the safety profile of A@@ DV@@ AT@@ E , which necess@@ it@@ ates a filing of P@@ SU@@ R@@ s every 6 months , the CH@@ MP decided that the authorisation holder should apply for another extension procedure in 5 years .
in December 2008 , Gen@@ du@@ x Mol@@ ecular Limited announced that the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) officially announced that the company will withdraw its application for the Adv@@ ex@@ in placing on the market for the treatment of Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i cancer .
normally , however , the breast , the brain , the bones or the soft tissues ( tissues that bind , surround and support other structures in the body ) are affected .
this is a type of virus that has been genetically modified to carry a gene into the cells of the body .
the virus in Adv@@ ex@@ in is a &quot; Aden@@ o@@ virus , &quot; which has been modified in such a way that it cannot produce copies of itself and thus cannot trigger infections in humans .
adv@@ ex@@ in could have been inj@@ ected directly into the tumours and thus enable the cancer cells to re @-@ form the normal p@@ 53 protein .
the p@@ 53 protein produced from the p@@ 53 gene existing in the human body normally contributes to the recovery of damaged DNA and to kill cells when DNA cannot be restored .
at Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i @-@ Cancer , where the p@@ 53 gene is defective , the p@@ 53 protein does not work properly , and the cancer cells can continue to grow and divide .
the company presented data from a study with a patient with Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i cancer in the under@@ belly area , bone and brain .
after the CH@@ MP tested the company &apos;s answers to the questions he asked , some questions were still unclear .
based on the examination of the initially submitted documents , the CH@@ MP created a list of questions sent to the company on day 120 .
according to the CH@@ MP , it was not sufficiently proven that Adv@@ ex@@ in Inj@@ ection in Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i tumours will benefit patients .
the committee also had concerns regarding the treatment of the drug in the body , the type of administration and the safety of the drug .
in addition , the company has not sufficiently demonstrated that Adv@@ ex@@ in can be manufactured in a reliable manner and that it is harmful to the environment or for people who come in close contact with the patient .
the company did not inform the CH@@ MP whether the withdrawal consequences for patients currently participating in clinical trials or &quot; re @-@ use use &quot; programs with adv@@ ex@@ in .
&quot; changed substance release &quot; means that the tablets are composed in such a way that one of the effective ingredients is released immediately and the other slowly over a few hours .
aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze is used to treat the symptoms of seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( hay fever , inflammation of the nas@@ al path@@ ways caused by allergy to p@@ ollen ) in patients with nas@@ al mu@@ cos@@ al swelling ( c@@ logged nose ) .
for adults and adolescents under 12 years of age , the recommended dose of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze is twice daily a tablet , which should be taken with a glass of water with or without food .
the duration of the treatment should be as short as possible and terminated as soon as the symptoms , especially swelling of the nas@@ al mu@@ cos@@ a ( c@@ logged nose ) , are cl@@ utter@@ ed .
a treatment duration of more than 10 days is not recommended because the effects of the drug can be reduced to the con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation of the nose .
the main efficacy measures were the changes in the sever@@ ity of the hay fever symptoms reported by the patients before the treatment and during the 15 @-@ day treatment .
during the study , patients had their symptoms every 12 hours in a diary and assessed with a standard scale , how difficult the symptoms were in the last 12 hours .
in examining all hay fever symptoms except the con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation of the nose , patients reported that the aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze received a decrease in symptoms by 4@@ 6.0 % , compared to 3@@ 5.@@ 9 % in patients receiving pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine alone .
if only the swelling of the nas@@ al mu@@ cos@@ a was seen , the patients under Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze showed a reduction in symptoms by 3@@ 7.@@ 4 % compared to 26.@@ 7 % in patients who had lost Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n alone .
the most common side effects of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze ( observed at 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are t@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ dia , mouth dry , di@@ zz@@ iness , psych@@ om@@ otor hyper@@ activity ( rest@@ lessness ) , con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation , headache , fatigue , in@@ som@@ nia ( sle@@ e@@ pl@@ essness ) , som@@ n@@ ol@@ ence ( sleep@@ iness ) , sleep disorders and nerv@@ ousness .
aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n , pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine or any of the other ingredients against adren@@ ergi@@ c agents or Lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n ( another drug for the treatment of allergies ) .
aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze may also not be used in patients who suffer from a narrow angle glaucoma ( increased intraocular pressure ) , cardiac or vascular diseases including hypertension ( hypertension ) , hyper@@ thy@@ ro@@ i@@ osis ( hyper@@ thy@@ ro@@ phy ) or a ha@@ em@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ gic stroke ( caused by cereb@@ ral ha@@ em@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ ge ) or have a risk of ha@@ em@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ gic stroke .
on 30 July 2007 , the European Commission issued a permit to the company SP Europe for the transport of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze across the European Union .
the tablet can be taken with a glass of water , but is swal@@ lowed whole ( i.e. without de@@ bit@@ ing , breaking or ch@@ ewing ) .
due to the absence of data on safety and efficacy ( see Section 5.1 ) , Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze should not be used in children under 12 years of age .
the duration of the application is as short as possible and should not be continued after the symptoms are finished .
it is recommended to limit the duration of application to 10 days , as the activity of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine may decrease with time .
after the swelling of the mu@@ cous membranes in the upper respiratory tract , the treatment can be continued as a mon@@ otherapy if necessary .
as Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze contains pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine , the medicine is also contra@@ indicated in patients who are treated with a mono@@ amine oxid@@ ase ( MA@@ O ) inhibit@@ or or within 2 weeks of termination of such therapy .
this is due to al@@ ph@@ am@@ im@@ etic activity in combined use of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine with other vas@@ o@@ con@@ stric@@ tors such as bro@@ mo@@ cri@@ pi@@ tin , per@@ go@@ lid , Lis@@ ur@@ id , Cab@@ erg@@ oline , erg@@ ot@@ amine , D@@ ih@@ y@@ dro@@ erg@@ ot@@ amine or other de@@ on@@ te@@ oti@@ kum ( phen@@ yl@@ pro@@ pan@@ ol , eph@@ ed@@ rine , oxy@@ met@@ az@@ oline , nap@@ haz@@ olin , etc . ) .
the safety and efficacy of this combination therapy were not tested for this patient collective and the data is insufficient to address appropriate dosage recommendations .
the safety and efficacy of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze were not tested in patients with kidney or liver dys@@ functions and the data do not suff@@ ice to address appropriate dosage recommendations .
patients must be informed that treatment in case of hypertension or t@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ dia or pal@@ pit@@ ations , cardiac ar@@ rhyth@@ mi@@ as , nausea , or any other neuro@@ logical symptoms ( such as head@@ aches or a gain of head@@ aches ) must be removed .
the treatment of the following patient groups is recommended : • Pati@@ ents with cardiac ar@@ rhyth@@ mi@@ as • Pati@@ ents with heart rhythm disorders • Pati@@ ents with hypertension • Pati@@ ents with a m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction in an@@ am@@ n@@ esis , diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus , bladder neck , or bron@@ ch@@ os@@ pas@@ m in an@@ am@@ n@@ esis .
aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze is to be dis@@ continued at least 48 hours prior to the carrying out of der@@ mat@@ ological tests , as anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines are otherwise able to prevent or reduce positive reactions to indicators for skin reactions .
in the context of clinical trials with des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n , in which er@@ y@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole were administered in addition , no clin@@ ically relevant interactions or changes in plasma concentrations of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n were observed .
in the results of the psych@@ om@@ otor testing no significant differences could be found between patients treated with dis@@ co@@ at@@ adi@@ n and placebo @-@ treated patients regardless of whether it was taken alone or with alcohol .
the enzyme responsible for the metabolism of the de@@ chlor@@ ate adi@@ n has not yet been identified , so that interactions with other medicines cannot be completely ruled out .
in vitro studies have shown that the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 does not inhi@@ bit C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 and is neither a substrate nor an inhibit@@ or of the P @-@ gly@@ cop@@ rot@@ eins .
the harm@@ lessness of the use of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze during pregnancy is not guaranteed , but experiences from a large number of affected pregn@@ ancies however did not increase the frequency of ab@@ norm@@ alities compared to the frequency of the normal population .
since reproductive studies on animals are not always transmitted to humans and due to the vas@@ o@@ con@@ stric@@ tive properties of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine , aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze should not be used during pregnancy .
however , patients should be informed that in very rare cases it may result in a di@@ zz@@ iness that may lead to impairment of transport or the ability to operate machines .
symptoms may vary between a CN@@ S @-@ depression ( se@@ dation , ap@@ nea , mental al@@ ert@@ ness , cy@@ an@@ osis , coma , cardiovascular collapse ) and a CN@@ S stimulation ( in@@ som@@ nia , hall@@ u@@ cin@@ ations , tre@@ mor , conv@@ ul@@ sions ) with possible let@@ tu@@ ces .
headache , anxiety , sc@@ ary mic@@ tion , muscle weakness and increased muscle tension , eu@@ ph@@ oria , arous@@ al , respiratory failure , cardiac ar@@ rhyth@@ mia , t@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ dia , pal@@ pit@@ ations , thirst , tran@@ spir@@ ation , nausea , vom@@ iting , preventive pain , di@@ zz@@ iness , t@@ innitus , at@@ ax@@ ia , blur@@ red vision and hyp@@ ot@@ ony .
a CN@@ S stimulation is most likely in children , as well as at@@ rop@@ ine @-@ typical symptoms ( dry mouth , pup@@ illary star@@ re and - di@@ lat@@ ation , skin redness , hyper@@ ther@@ mia , and gastro@@ intestinal symptoms ) .
these include inhibit@@ ing the release of pro @-@ inflammatory cy@@ tok@@ ines such as IL @-@ 4 , IL @-@ 6 , IL @-@ 8 and IL @-@ 13 from human mast cells / bas@@ op@@ hil@@ es as well as the in@@ hibition of the expression of the adhesion molecules P sel@@ ector to endo@@ theli@@ al cells .
in a single dose trial with adults , Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n 5 mg did not show any influence on standard measurement variables of the flight performance , including the reinforcement of subjective sleep@@ iness or the tasks associated with flying .
in controlled clinical trials no increased frequency of som@@ n@@ ol@@ ence compared to placebo was observed at the recommended dosage of 5 mg daily .
the oral application of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine in the recommended dosage can cause other symp@@ a@@ thetic effects , such as an increase in blood pressure , t@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ dia or manifestations of CN@@ S exc@@ itation .
1,@@ 24@@ 8 patients aged between 12 and 78 took part in seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s , with 4@@ 14 patients receiving aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablets .
in both studies the hist@@ amine @-@ antagon@@ istic efficacy of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablets was significantly higher compared to the overall score for the symptoms ( except nas@@ al mu@@ cos@@ al swelling ) , significantly higher than under a mon@@ otherapy with pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine over the 2 @-@ week treatment period .
the efficacy of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablets with regard to the swelling effect , determined by the nas@@ al mu@@ cos@@ al swelling , was significantly higher than under a mon@@ otherapy with des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n over the 2 @-@ week treatment period .
the effectiveness of the aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablets showed no significant differences regarding gender , age or eth@@ ni@@ city .
as part of a single dose trial for pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze , de@@ chlor@@ ate adi@@ n is det@@ ectable within 30 minutes after administration in the plasma .
after the per@@ oral application of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze in healthy subjects over 14 days , the floating equilibrium of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n , 3 @-@ Hydro@@ xy@@ des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n and Pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine was reached on day 10 .
in the context of a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic multiple dose study , which was carried out with the formulation as a tablet in healthy adult subjects , it was found that four subjects were poorly metabolism .
a component interaction study shows that the exposure ( C@@ max and AU@@ C ) of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine , after the sole dispens@@ ation of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine , was equivalent to the exposure of an aer@@ os@@ ze tablet .
based on conventional studies on safety har@@ mac@@ ology , toxic@@ ity in repeated application , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity and reproductive toxic@@ ity , the prec@@ lin@@ ical data with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n do not reveal any particular dangers to humans .
the combination had no greater toxic@@ ity than its individual components , and the observed effects were generally associated with the ingredient pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine .
in reproductive toxic@@ ological studies the combination of Lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n / pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine was not ter@@ ato@@ genic in a dose of up to 150 mg / kg / day and to rab@@ bits in a dose of up to 120 mg / kg / day .
March 2007 and in Module 1.@@ 8.1 of the admission application described pharmac@@ o@@ vig@@ il@@ ance system is established and works before and while the product is on the market .

inform your doctor if you are experiencing or diagnos@@ ing the following symptoms or diseases when using Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze : • High blood pressure • Cardi@@ ovascular disorders • nausea and head@@ aches , or strengthening existing head@@ aches .
if you are taking any medicinal products with other medicines , please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you are using other medicines or have recently taken it , even if it is not prescription medicine .
when applying in the recommended dosage , it is not to be expected that aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze leads to di@@ zz@@ iness or reduces the attention .
if you have taken a larger amount of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze than you ought to immediately inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you have taken a larger amount of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze than you ought to .
if you forget to take an aer@@ os@@ ze dose if you forgot to take a dose in time , take the application as soon as possible and apply the next dose at the appropriate time .
please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if any of the side effects listed below may significantly imp@@ air you or notice any side effects that are not indicated in this information .
heart ch@@ asing , rest@@ lessness with increased physical activity , dry mouth , di@@ zz@@ iness , sore throat , loss of appetite , con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation , sugar in the urine , increased blood sugar , thirst , fatigue , headache , sleep disorders , nerv@@ ousness and di@@ zz@@ iness .

after the market launch of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n very rarely was reported about cases of severe allergic reactions ( short@@ ness of breath , whi@@ stling breathing , it@@ ching , hi@@ ves and swelling ) or skin rash .
cases of heart pal@@ pit@@ ations , heart ch@@ asing , abdominal pain , nausea , vom@@ iting , stomach upset , diar@@ rhe@@ a , hall@@ u@@ cin@@ ations , di@@ zz@@ iness , drow@@ sin@@ ess , som@@ nia , muscle pain , sei@@ zur@@ es , rest@@ lessness with increased physical activity , over cases of inflammation of the liver and over cases of con@@ spic@@ uous liver values has also been reported very rarely .
it is available as 5 mg tablet , 5 mg ly@@ op@@ hil@@ is@@ at for intake ( soluble tablet ) , 2.5 mg and 5 mg of melting tablets ( tablets that dissolve in the mouth ) , 0.5 mg / ml sy@@ rup and as 0.5 mg / ml solution for intake .
for children aged one to five years , the dose is 1.@@ 25 mg once daily , which is in the form of 2.5 ml sy@@ rup or sy@@ rup .
for children aged six to eleven , the dose is 2.5 mg once a day , either in the form of 5 ml sy@@ rup or sy@@ rup .
A@@ eri@@ us was studied in eight studies of about 4 800 adults and adolescents with allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( including four trials of seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s and two studies on patients who also had asthma ) .
efficacy was measured by investigating the symptoms ( it@@ ching , number and size of the quad@@ rants , impairment of sleep and performance on the day ) before and after six weeks of treatment .
further studies have been submitted to demonstrate that the body uses the sy@@ rup , the solution for inhal@@ ing and melting tablets in the same way as the tablets and the application in children is harmless .
in the case of allergic rh@@ initi@@ s , when the results of all studies were taken together , the two @-@ week treatment with 5 mg A@@ eri@@ us resulted in an average decrease in symptom scores ( symptom scores ) by 25 to 32 % , compared to the decrease of 12 to 26 % in patients receiving placebo .
in both studies at Ur@@ tic@@ aria , the decrease in symptom scores after six weeks of treatment with A@@ eri@@ us 58 and 67 % , compared with 40 and 33 % in patients treated with placebo .
A@@ eri@@ us may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n , Lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n or any of the other ingredients .
in January 2001 , the European Commission issued a permit to the company SP Europe for the transport of A@@ eri@@ us throughout the European Union .
one tablet once a day , with or without a meal , to relieve symptoms of allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( including inter@@ mitt@@ ent and persistent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ) and ur@@ tic@@ aria ( see section 5.1 ) .
there is limited experience from clinical studies of efficacy in the application of de@@ chlor@@ at@@ adi@@ n in adolescents from 12 to 17 years ( see Sec@@ tions 4.@@ 8 and 5.1 ) .
the treatment of the allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( occurrence of symptoms for less than 4 days a week or less than 4 weeks ) should be carried out according to the course of the disease and can be resum@@ ed following the sound of the symptoms and resum@@ ed with their recur@@ rence .
in case of per@@ si@@ sting allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( occurrence of symptoms to 4 or more days a week and more than 4 weeks ) , the patient can be recommended during the allergy period .
clin@@ ically relevant interactions were not found in the context of clinical studies with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n tablets where er@@ y@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole were administered in addition ( see section 5.1 ) .
in a clinical pharmac@@ ological study , the performance of alcohol was not increased while taking A@@ eri@@ us and alcohol ( see section 5.1 ) .
however , patients should be informed that in very rare cases it can come to di@@ zz@@ iness which may lead to impairment of traffic or the ability to operate machines .
in clinical trials in various indications including allergic rh@@ initi@@ s and chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , the recommended dose of 5 mg daily reported 3 % more side effects in patients with A@@ eri@@ us than those treated with placebo .
the most common adverse events reported more frequently than placebo were fatigue ( 1.2 % ) , dry mouth ( 0.8 % ) and headache ( 0.@@ 6 % ) .
in a clinical study involving 5@@ 78 young patients aged between 12 and 17 , the most common side effect was head@@ aches ; this occurred in 5.@@ 9 % of patients treated with dis@@ co@@ at@@ adi@@ n and 6.@@ 9 % of patients treated with placebo .
no clin@@ ically relevant effects were observed in a multi @-@ dose trial , which was administered up to 45 mg of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n ( nine @-@ fold clinical dose ) .
this includes inhibit@@ ing the release of pro @-@ inflammatory cy@@ tok@@ ines such as IL @-@ 4 , IL @-@ 6 , IL @-@ 8 and IL @-@ 13 from human mast cells / bas@@ op@@ hil@@ es as well as the in@@ hibition of the expression of the adhesion molecules P sel@@ ector to endo@@ theli@@ al cells .
in the context of a clinical study with multiple doses administered in a dose of up to 20 mg daily for 14 days , no statisti@@ cally significant or clin@@ ically relevant cardiovascular effect was described .
in a clinical pharmac@@ ological study , in which des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n was administered in a dose of 45 mg daily ( which was nine times the clinical dose ) over ten days , no extension of the Q@@ t@@ c interval was observed .
in a single dose @-@ study with adults , Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n 5 mg did not show any influence on standard measurement variables of the flight performance , including the reinforcement of subjective sleep@@ iness or the tasks associated with flying .
in patients with allergic rh@@ initi@@ s , A@@ eri@@ us was effective in reli@@ eving symptoms such as sne@@ e@@ zing , nas@@ al secre@@ tion and it@@ ching of the nose , it@@ ching , tears of tears and redness of the eyes as well as it@@ ching on the palate .
in addition to the established classification in seas@@ on@@ ally and per@@ ennial , allergic rh@@ initi@@ s may also be divided into inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s and per@@ si@@ sting allergic rh@@ initi@@ s depending on the duration of the symptoms .
inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s is defined as the occurrence of symptoms for less than 4 days a week or less than 4 weeks .
per@@ si@@ sting allergic rh@@ initi@@ s is defined as the occurrence of symptoms to 4 or more days a week and more than 4 weeks .
as demonstrated by the overall score of the questionnaire on quality of life in Rhin@@ o @-@ con@@ junc@@ tivi@@ tis , A@@ eri@@ us effectively reduces the strain caused by seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s .
the chron@@ ically idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria was investigated as a substitute for further forms of ur@@ tic@@ aria , because the underlying path@@ ophysi@@ ology , regardless of the e@@ ti@@ ology , is similar in the different forms and chronic patients can be recru@@ ited simply pro@@ spec@@ tively .
since hist@@ am@@ inf@@ ancy is a caus@@ ative factor in all ur@@ tic@@ aria diseases , it is expected that in other forms of ur@@ tic@@ aria , in other forms of ur@@ tic@@ aria , Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n will also improve the symptoms ; this is confirmed by the recommendations of the clinical guidelines .
in two placebo @-@ controlled trials over 6 weeks in patients with chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , A@@ eri@@ us was effective in improving the ur@@ itus and the reduction of size and number of squares at the end of the first dose interval .
as in other studies with anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ini@@ ka in chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria the minority of patients who did not react to anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines were excluded from the study .
improvement of the it@@ ching rate by more than 50 % was observed in 55 % of patients treated with dis@@ co@@ at@@ adi@@ n compared to 19 % of patients treated with placebo .
treatment with A@@ eri@@ us significantly reduced the distur@@ b@@ ance of sleep and wak@@ efulness as measured by a 4 @-@ point scale for evaluating these variables .
in a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic study , in which patients with the general seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s population were comparable , 4 % of patients achieved a higher concentration of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n .
there are no indications for clin@@ ically relevant cum@@ ulation after once daily use of di@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n ( 5@@ - 20 mg ) for 14 days .
however , the enzyme responsible for the metabolism of the de@@ chlor@@ ate adi@@ n has not yet been identified , so that interactions with other medicines are not completely eliminated .
neither C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 and in @-@ vitro studies have shown that the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 does not inhi@@ bit C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 and is neither a substrate nor an inhibit@@ or of the P @-@ gly@@ cop@@ rot@@ eins .
in a single dose study with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n in a dose of 7.5 mg meals ( fatty , cal@@ orie rich breakfast ) did not affect the availability of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n .
the prec@@ lin@@ ical studies conducted with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n and Lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n showed no qualitative or quantitative differences regarding the toxic@@ ity profile of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n and Lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n .
based on conventional studies on safety har@@ mac@@ ology , toxic@@ ity in repeated application , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity and reproductive toxic@@ ity , the prec@@ lin@@ ical data with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n do not reveal any particular dangers to humans .

A@@ eri@@ us can be taken independently of meals to relieve symptoms of allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( including inter@@ mitt@@ ent and persistent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ) and ur@@ tic@@ aria ( see section 5.1 ) .
the prescri@@ bing physician should be aware that most cases of rh@@ initi@@ s in children under 2 years are caused by an infection ( see section 4.4 ) and that there are no data that support a treatment of infectious rh@@ initi@@ s with A@@ eri@@ us .
in addition to the exclusion of upper respiratory tract infections or anatom@@ ical anom@@ ali@@ es , an@@ am@@ n@@ esis , physical examinations and appropriate laboratory and skin examinations should play a role in the diagnosis .
about 6 % of adults and children aged between 2 and 11 are met@@ abo@@ li@@ zing de@@ chlor@@ ate adi@@ n and experiencing a higher exposure to substance ( see section 5.2 ) .
the safety of A@@ eri@@ us sy@@ rup in children between 2 and 11 years that are met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed is identical to those in children who are normal metabol@@ ising .
this drug contains su@@ c@@ rose and sor@@ bit@@ ol ; therefore , patients with her@@ edi@@ tary problems of fru@@ c@@ tose intoler@@ ance , glucose @-@ gal@@ act@@ ose ad@@ sorption or su@@ c@@ rose @-@ is@@ om@@ alt@@ as@@ - failure should not take this medicine .
clin@@ ically relevant interactions were not found in clinical studies with A@@ eri@@ us tablets where er@@ y@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole were administered in addition ( see section 5.1 ) .
in a clinical pharmac@@ ological study , the performance of alcohol was not increased while taking A@@ eri@@ us tablets and alcohol ( see section 5.1 ) .
the overall incidence of adverse events in children aged between 2 and 11 was similar to the placebo group in the A@@ eri@@ us Si@@ rup Group .
in clinical studies with adults and adolescents in various indications , including allergic rh@@ initi@@ s and chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , the recommended dose reported 3 % more side effects in patients with A@@ eri@@ us than those treated with placebo .
no clin@@ ically relevant effects were observed in a multi @-@ dose trial for adults and adolescents who administered up to 45 mg of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n ( nine @-@ fold clinical dose ) .
children between 1 and 11 years of age who came into question for an anti@@ hist@@ amine therapy received a daily dietary supplement of 1.@@ 25 mg ( between 1 and 5 years ) or 2.5 mg ( aged between 6 and 11 years ) .
because the course of allergic rh@@ initi@@ s / chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria and the profile of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n are similar in adults and children , the efficacy data of de@@ chlor@@ ate adi@@ n in adults can be extra@@ pol@@ ated to the children &apos;s population .
in the context of a clinical study with multiple doses of adults and adolescents , in which Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n was used in a dosage of up to 20 mg daily for 14 days , no statisti@@ cally significant or clin@@ ically relevant cardiovascular effect was described .
in a clinical pharmac@@ ological study of adults and adolescents , in which Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n was used in a dose of 45 mg daily ( which was nine times the clinical dose ) for ten days in adults , no extension of the Q@@ t@@ c interval showed .
in controlled clinical trials , no increased frequency of som@@ n@@ ol@@ ence compared to placebo was observed at the recommended dosage of 5 mg daily for adults and adolescents .
at a single daily dose of 7.5 mg , A@@ eri@@ us tablets did not interfere with psych@@ om@@ otor disorders in adults and adolescents in clinical studies .
clin@@ ically pharmac@@ ological studies in adults occurred due to the simultaneous intake of alcohol , neither to increase the alcohol @-@ induced impairment of performance nor to increase drow@@ sin@@ ess .
in adult and adol@@ escent patients with allergic rh@@ initi@@ s , A@@ eri@@ us tablets were effective in reli@@ eving symptoms such as sne@@ e@@ zing , nas@@ al secre@@ tion and it@@ ching of the nose , it@@ ching , tears of tears and redness of the eyes as well as it@@ ching on the palate .
as shown on the basis of the overall score of the questionnaire on quality of life in Rhin@@ o @-@ con@@ junc@@ tivi@@ tis , A@@ eri@@ us tablets effectively reduce the caused by seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s
in two placebo @-@ controlled trials over 6 weeks in patients with chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , A@@ eri@@ us was effective in improving the ur@@ itus and the reduction of size and number of squares at the end of the first dose interval .
the spread of this limited @-@ met@@ abo@@ li@@ zing phen@@ otype was comparable to adults ( 6 % ) and children between 2 and 11 years ( 6 % ) and in both populations larger in black ( 18 % adults , 16 % children ) than in Cau@@ ca@@ si@@ ans ( 2 % adults , 3 % children ) .
similar pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic parameters were observed in a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic multi@@ dose study with the sy@@ rup formulation of children between 2 and 11 years with allergic rh@@ initi@@ s , which are restricted by limited metabolism .
the burden ( AU@@ C ) by Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n was about 6 times higher after 3 to 6 hours and the C@@ max approximately 3 to 4 times higher with a termin@@ ale half @-@ time of about 120 hours .
there are no indications for clin@@ ically relevant active ingredients accumulation after once daily use of dis@@ co@@ at@@ adi@@ n ( 5@@ - 20 mg ) for 14 days in adults and adolescents .
12 In various single dose trials , AU@@ C and C@@ max values of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n in pedi@@ atric patients were comparable with recommended doses with those of adults who received des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n sy@@ rup in a dose of 5 mg .
however , the enzyme responsible for the metabolism of the de@@ chlor@@ ate adi@@ n has not yet been identified , so that interactions with other medicines cannot be completely ruled out .
A@@ eri@@ us Si@@ rup is available in type III bra@@ id bottles with 30 , 50 , 60 , 100 , 120 , 150 , 225 and 300 ml .
equipped with a rigid , transparent pol@@ yst@@ yr@@ ene measuring spoon , calibr@@ ated with 2.5 ml and 5 ml or with an application sy@@ ringe for preparation with sc@@ aling of 2.5 ml and 5 ml ( only for the 150 ml bottle ) .

immediately prior to the application , the bli@@ ster must be carefully opened and the dose of the Ly@@ op@@ hil@@ ism can be removed for insertion without damaging it .
clin@@ ically relevant interactions were not found in clinical studies with A@@ eri@@ us tablets where er@@ y@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole were additionally used ( see section 5.1 ) .
clinical trials in various indications including allergic rh@@ initi@@ s and chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria were reported at the recommended dose of 5 mg daily 3 % more side effects in patients with A@@ eri@@ us tablets than those treated with placebo .
in a multi @-@ dose trial , which was used for up to 45 mg of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n ( nine @-@ fold clinical dose ) , no clin@@ ically relevant effects were observed .
in two single dose trials , A@@ eri@@ us Ly@@ op@@ hil@@ is@@ at was well tolerated ; this was documented by clinical laboratory results , medical examinations , vital signs and EC@@ G interval data .
in the context of a clinical study with multiple doses administered in a dose of up to 20 mg daily for 14 days , no statisti@@ cally significant or clin@@ ically relevant cardiovascular effect was described .
in a clinical pharmac@@ ological study , in which des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n was used in a dose of 45 mg daily ( nine times the clinical dose ) over ten days , no extension of the Q@@ t@@ c interval was observed .
in controlled clinical trials no increased frequency of som@@ n@@ ol@@ ence compared to placebo was observed at the recommended dosage of 5 mg daily .
at a 17 single dose trial with adults , Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n 5 mg did not show any influence on standard measurement variables of the flight performance , including the reinforcement of subjective sleep@@ iness or the tasks associated with flying .
in patients with allergic rh@@ initi@@ s , A@@ eri@@ us tablets were effective in reli@@ eving symptoms such as sne@@ e@@ zing , nas@@ al secre@@ tion and it@@ ching of the nose , it@@ ching , tears of tears and redness of the eyes as well as it@@ ching on the palate .
as demonstrated by the overall score of the questionnaire on quality of life in Rhin@@ o @-@ con@@ junc@@ tivi@@ tis , A@@ eri@@ us effectively reduces the strain caused by seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s .

two A@@ eri@@ us 2.5 mg of melting tablets once daily put in the mouth to relieve symptoms of allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( including inter@@ mitt@@ ent and persistent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ) and ur@@ tic@@ aria ( see section 5.1 ) .
there is limited experience from clinical studies on efficacy in the application of de@@ chlor@@ at@@ adi@@ n in adolescents from 12 to 17 years ( see Sec@@ tions 4.@@ 8 and 5.1 )
immediately before use , the bli@@ ster must be carefully opened and the dose of the melting tray is removed without damaging it .
the efficacy and safety of A@@ eri@@ us 2.5 mg of melting tablets in the treatment of children under 6 years have not been proven so far .
the overall frequency of adverse events between the dis@@ co @-@ ad@@ ine sy@@ rup and placebo group was the same and did not differ significantly from the safety profile established in adult patients .
at the recommended dose , A@@ eri@@ us enam@@ el tablets proved to be a bio@@ equivalent to the A@@ eri@@ us 5 mg of conventional tablets formulation and the A@@ eri@@ us 5 mg ly@@ op@@ hil@@ is@@ ate to be engaged in formul@@ ating des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n .
in the context of a clinical study with multiple doses administered in a dose of up to 20 mg daily for 14 days , no statisti@@ cally significant or clin@@ ically significant effect was observed .

the spread of this poorly met@@ abo@@ li@@ zing phen@@ otype was comparable to adult ( 6 % ) and pa@@ edi@@ atric patients between 2 and 11 years ( 6 % ) , and under black ( adults 18 % , children 16 % ) , the safety profile of these patients , however , was not different from that of the general population .
in single dose crossover studies of A@@ eri@@ us melting tablets with A@@ eri@@ us 5 mg of conventional tablets or A@@ eri@@ us 5 mg ly@@ op@@ hil@@ is@@ at , the form@@ ulations were bio@@ equivalent .
A@@ eri@@ us 2.5 mg tablets were not studied in pedi@@ atric patients , but in combination with dose @-@ finding studies in children , pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic data for A@@ eri@@ us melting tablets support the use of 2.5 mg dosage in children from 6 to 11 years .

the safety of de@@ chlor@@ ate adi@@ n in children between 2 and 11 years that are met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed is identical to those in children who are normal metabol@@ ising .
this drug contains sor@@ bit@@ ol ; therefore , patients with her@@ edi@@ tary problems of fru@@ c@@ tose intoler@@ ance , glucose @-@ gal@@ act@@ ose ad@@ sorption or su@@ c@@ rose @-@ is@@ om@@ alt@@ ase in@@ suffici@@ ency should not take this medicine .
the overall incidence of adverse events in children aged between 2 and 11 was similar to that of the placebo group .
in infants between 6 and 23 months , the most common adverse events reported as placebo reported di@@ ar@@ rho@@ ea ( 3.@@ 7 % ) , fever ( 2,3 % ) and sle@@ e@@ pl@@ essness ( 2,3 % ) .
in an additional study , no adverse events were observed in patients between the ages of 6 and 11 at a single @-@ time dose of 2.5 mg .
at the recommended doses , the plasma concentrations of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n ( see section 5.2 ) were comparable in the children &apos;s and adult population .
in controlled clinical trials , no increased frequency of som@@ n@@ ol@@ ence compared to placebo was observed at the recommended dosage of 5 mg daily for adults and adolescents .
in addition to the established classification in seas@@ on@@ ally and per@@ ennial , allergic rh@@ initi@@ s may also occur in inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s , depending on the duration of the symptoms .
as demonstrated by the overall score of the questionnaire on quality of life in Rhin@@ o @-@ con@@ junc@@ tivi@@ tis , A@@ eri@@ us tablets effectively reduce the strain caused by seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s .

June 2008 Nov@@ arti@@ s V@@ acc@@ ines and Diagnostics S.@@ r.@@ l. announced that the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) officially announced that the company will withdraw its application for the introduction of A@@ fl@@ un@@ ov for the prevention of avi@@ ar H@@ 5@@ N@@ 1 influ@@ enza in adults and older people .
A@@ fl@@ un@@ ov should be used in adults and older people to protect against influ@@ enza caused by the strain ( type ) H@@ 5@@ N@@ 1 of the influ@@ enza A virus .
this is a special kind of vaccine that is intended to protect against a strain of the flu virus that could cause a future pan@@ de@@ mic .
a flu pan@@ de@@ mic breaks out when a new strain of the flu virus appears , which can easily spread from man to man , because humans have not yet built up immunity ( no protection ) against it .
following the addition of the vaccine , the immune system recognis@@ es the parts of the flu virus that are contained in the vaccine as &quot; foreign &quot; and forms antibodies against it .
as a result , the immune system will later be able to produce antibodies with a flu virus in contact with a flu virus .
subsequently , the membrane envelope of the virus was puri@@ fied with the &quot; surface anti@@ gens &quot; ( proteins on the membrane surface , which the human body recognizes as a body alien ) , puri@@ fied and used as a constitu@@ ent of the vaccine .
a survey of some of the study centres showed that the study was not carried out according to the &quot; good clinical practice &quot; ( G@@ CP ) .
as a result , the scope of the clinical data base for evaluating the safety of the vaccine was not sufficient to meet the requirements of the E@@ MEA guidelines for pan@@ de@@ mic vacc@@ ines .
if you are taking part in a clinical trial and require further information on your treatment , please contact your attending physician .
if you would like more information on the basis of the CH@@ MP recommendations , please read the scientific discussion ( also part of the EP@@ AR ) .
it is used in combination with other anti@@ viral medicines to treat adults and children over four years , which are infected with the human immun@@ o@@ deficiency virus of type 1 ( HIV @-@ 1 ) , which causes the acquired immun@@ o@@ deficiency syndrome ( AIDS ) .
for patients who cannot swal@@ low the capsules , as@@ gener@@ ase is available as a solution for intake , but this cannot be taken together with k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , as the safety of this combination has not been studied .
as@@ sh@@ re@@ ase should only be prescribed when the doctor has examined which anti@@ viral drugs the patient has previously taken , and the lik@@ el@@ ihood that the virus is addressed to the drug .
the recommended dose for patients over twelve years is 600 mg twice daily , which are taken together with twice daily 100 mg of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r and with other anti@@ viral medicines .
for children between four and twelve years and in patients with a body weight of less than 50 kg , the recommended dose of as@@ en@@ ase depends on body weight .
in combination with other anti@@ viral medicines , as@@ part@@ ase reduces the amount of HIV in the blood and keeps it at a low level .
unable to cure AIDS , however , can delay the damage of the immune system and thus also the development of infections and diseases associated with AIDS .
A@@ gener@@ ase was studied in combination with other anti@@ viral medicines , but without Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , in two main studies with 7@@ 36 HIV @-@ infected adults who had previously not been treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors .
the high @-@ dose Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r increased drug azi@@ en@@ ase was compared to other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors in 20@@ 6 adults who used prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors earlier .
the main indicator of efficacy was the proportion of patients with non @-@ det@@ ectable levels of HIV in the blood ( viral load ) or the viral load changes after treatment .
in the studies with patients who had previously not taken prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , after 48 weeks under A@@ gener@@ ase more patients had a viral load of less than 400 copies / ml than placebo , but A@@ gener@@ ase was less effective than in@@ din@@ avi@@ r .
in children , the virus also decreased the viral load , but only very few of the children who had previously been treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors were very few in response to the treatment .
in the study with adults who had previously been treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , the drug A@@ gener@@ ase strengthened the viral load after 16 @-@ week treatment as effective as other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors :
in the patients with HIV , which was resistant to four other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , there was a greater decrease of the viral load after four weeks with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r compared to the patients receiving their previous prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors :
the most common side effects of A@@ gener@@ ase ( observed in more than 1 of 10 patients ) are head@@ aches , diar@@ rho@@ ea ( diar@@ rhe@@ a ) , flat@@ ul@@ ence ( flat@@ ul@@ ence ) , nausea , vom@@ iting , rash and Fati@@ gue ( fatigue ) .
2 / 3 A@@ en@@ ase may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r or any of the other ingredients .
as@@ part@@ ase can also not be used in patients who take St. John &apos;s wort ( a herbal supplement for the treatment of depression ) or medicines that are broken down just like as@@ part@@ ase and are harmful to health in high concentrations in the blood .
as with other drugs against HIV , the risk of li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy ( changes in body fat distribution ) , oste@@ o@@ arthritis ( death of bone tissue ) or an immune activation syndrome ( symptoms of an infection caused by the rest@@ ful immune system ) .
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that the benefits of as@@ gen@@ ase in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines were out@@ weighed for the treatment of HIV @-@ 1 infected adults and children over four years .
A@@ gener@@ ase is usually taken together with the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic amplifier Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , but the committee found that the benefits of as@@ gen@@ ase in combination with k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r in patients who have previously not taken prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors are not proven .
A@@ gener@@ ase was originally licensed under &quot; extraordinary circumstances &quot; as only limited information was provided at the time of approval for scientific reasons .
in October 2000 , the European Commission issued a permit to Gla@@ xo Group Limited for the placing on the market of A@@ gener@@ ase in the entire European Union .
as@@ en@@ ase is indicated in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines to treat HIV @-@ 1 infected , prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors ( PI ) -@@ treated adults and children over 4 years .
usually as@@ en@@ ase capsules should be given to the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic boo@@ sting of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r along with low doses of k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( see Sec@@ tions 4.2 and 4.5 ) .
the use of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r should be carried out taking into account the individual viral resistance pattern and the pre@@ treatment of the patient ( see Section 5.1 ) .
the bio@@ availability of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r as a solution to intake is 14 % lower than am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r as capsule ; therefore , as@@ en@@ ase capsules and solution for intake on one milli@@ gram per milli@@ gram base are not inter@@ changeable ( see Section 5.2 ) .
the recommended dose for as@@ en@@ ase capsules is 600 mg of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r twice daily along with 100 mg of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines .
2 If as@@ en@@ oid capsules are applied without the increased added of k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( boo@@ sting ) , higher doses of as@@ en@@ ase ( 1200 mg twice daily ) must be applied .
the recommended dose for as@@ en@@ ase capsules is 20 mg of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / kg body weight twice daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines up to a daily dose of 24@@ 00 mg of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r which should not be exceeded ( see section 5.1 ) .
the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics , efficacy and safety of as@@ en@@ ase in combination with low doses of k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r or other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors were not examined in children .
as@@ en@@ ase is not recommended for use in children under 4 years of age , due to lack of data on safety and effectiveness ( see Section 5.2 ) .
based on pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic data , the dose of as@@ en@@ ase in adult patients with moderate liver function disorder should be reduced to 450 mg twice daily and in patients with severe liver dys@@ functions to 300 mg twice daily .
the simultaneous application should be conducted with caution in patients with mild or moderate liver dysfunction , in patients with severe liver dysfunction , they are contra@@ indicated ( see Section 4.3 ) .
as@@ gener@@ a must not be given at the same time with medicines which have a low therapeutic width and are also subject to medi@@ ums of the cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom P@@ 450 I@@ so@@ enzyme 3@@ A4 ( C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 ) .
herbal preparations containing St. John &apos;s wort ( Hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) may not be used because of the risk of reduced plasma concentrations and a dimin@@ ished therapeutic effect of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r during the intake of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( see Section 4.5 ) .
patients should be advised that atri@@ al or any other anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy does not lead to a cure of HIV infection and that they can continue to develop opportun@@ istic infections or other complications of HIV infection .
the current anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy including treatment with as@@ sh@@ re@@ ase does not prevent the risk of transmitting HIV to others through sexual contact or contamination with blood .
usually as@@ en@@ ase capsules should be used together with low doses of k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r and in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines ( see section 4.2 ) .
patients who suffer from chronic hepatitis B or C and are treated with anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy have an increased risk of serious liver re@@ perc@@ ussions with potentially fatal outcome .
in case of simultaneous anti@@ viral treatment of hepatitis B or C please consult the relevant specialist information of this medicine .
patients with pre @-@ existing liver function , including chronic @-@ active hepatitis , show increased frequency of liver dysfunction under an anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy and should be monitored according to clinical practice .
the simultaneous use of A@@ gener@@ ase and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r with flu@@ ti@@ cas@@ one or other glu@@ co@@ cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ids , which are metabol@@ ised via C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , is not recommended unless the potential benefits of treatment out@@ weigh the risk of systemic cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oid@@ al effects including Mor@@ bus C@@ ush@@ ing and Supp@@ ression of the adren@@ al function ( see Section 4.5 ) .
since the metabolism of the H@@ MG Co@@ A reduc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ or Lov@@ e@@ atin and Sim@@ v@@ ast@@ atin is highly dependent on C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , a simultaneous administration of as@@ en@@ ase with Lov@@ e@@ atin and Sim@@ v@@ ast@@ atin is not recommended because of the increased risk of my@@ opath@@ ies including r@@ hab@@ dom@@ y@@ oly@@ sis .
4 For some medicines that may cause serious or life @-@ threatening side effects such as carb@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine , phen@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ depres@@ s@@ ants and war@@ far@@ in ( under supervision of the International Standard R@@ atio ) , methods are available to determine the drug concentration .
in patients who take this medicine at the same time , am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r can be less effective because of reduced plasma levels ( see Section 4.5 ) .
due to the possibility of metabolic interactions with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , the effectiveness of hormon@@ al contrac@@ ep@@ tives may be altered , but the information is not sufficient to assess the nature of the interactions .
if meth@@ ad@@ one is given at the same time with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , patients should therefore be monitored on O@@ pi@@ ate withdrawal symptoms , especially if there are also low doses of k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r administered .
because of the possible risk of toxic@@ ity due to the high prop@@ yl English content of the A@@ gener@@ ase solution , this formulation is contra@@ indicated in children under a age of four years and should be used with care for certain other patient populations .
as@@ gen@@ ase should be set in duration 5 when a rash of systemic or allergic symptoms is accompanied or the mu@@ cous membranes are involved ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) .
patients receiving anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy including prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors were reported on the incidence of diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus , hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia , or an ex@@ az@@ ation of an existing diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus .
many of the patients had other illnesses whose therapy was required to be associated with the development of diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus or hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia .
B. increased age , and with drug @-@ dependent factors , such as prolonged anti@@ retro@@ viral treatment and associated metabolic disorders associated with it .
in hem@@ ophi@@ lic patients ( type A and B ) treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , reports about an increase of bleeding including spontaneous cut@@ aneous hem@@ at@@ oma and hem@@ o@@ thro@@ sis are present .
in HIV @-@ infected patients with severe immune defect , an anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy ( ART ) may develop an inflammatory response to asy@@ mpt@@ om@@ atic or residual opportun@@ istic infections , leading to severe clinical conditions or wor@@ sen@@ ing symptoms .
although multi@@ fac@@ torial ae@@ ti@@ ology is accepted ( including use of cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids , alcohol consumption , severe immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression , higher body mass index ) , cases of oste@@ o@@ arthritis were reported in particular in patients with advanced HIV infection and / or long @-@ term application of an anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy ( ART ) .
C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 Sub@@ strate with low therapeu@@ tical width as@@ en@@ ase must not be given at the same time with medicines which have a low therapeutic width and are also subject to medi@@ ums of the cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom P@@ 450 I@@ so@@ enzyme 3@@ A4 ( C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 ) .
C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 medi@@ ums with a low therapeutic width ap@@ ri@@ ase with k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r must not be combined with medicines , whose active ingredients are predominantly metabol@@ ised using C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 and are associated with severe and / or life @-@ threatening side effects .
it has been shown that Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in causes a 82 % reduction in the AU@@ C of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , which can lead to a vi@@ ro@@ logical failure and a resistance development .
in trying to compensate the degra@@ ded plasma levels by a dose increase of other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors in combination with k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , adverse effects on the liver were often observed .
St. John &apos;s wort ( Hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) The serum levels of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r can be reduced by the simultaneous use of herbal preparations with St. John &apos;s wort ( Hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) .
if a patient already uses Johann@@ is@@ k@@ raut , the am@@ pren@@ avi@@ es are and , if possible , check the viral load and remove the St. John &apos;s wort .
dosage adjustment for one of the drugs is not required when nel@@ fin@@ avi@@ r is administered together with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( see also E@@ fa@@ vi@@ ren@@ z below ) .
50 % increase for C@@ max by 30 % if Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) was administered in combination with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r capsules ( 600 mg twice daily ) .
in clinical trials , doses of 600 mg of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r were used twice daily and k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg twice daily , demonstrating the efficacy and safety of this treatment scheme .
52 % lower when am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 750 mg twice daily ) was administered in combination with Kal@@ et@@ ra ( 400 mg Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r + 100 mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily ) .
the C@@ min values of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r in plasma ( 600 mg twice daily ) with Kal@@ et@@ ra ( 400 mg Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r + 100 mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily ) are approximately 40 to 50 % lower than if am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) is administered twice daily in combination with 100 mg of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
dosage recommendations for the simultaneous administration of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and Kal@@ et@@ ra can not be given , however , it is recommended a close monitoring because the effectiveness and safety of this combination is not known .
no pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic study was carried out for use of di@@ dan@@ os@@ ine in combination with di@@ dan@@ os@@ ine , but due to the f@@ antasi@@ es of Di@@ dan@@ os@@ ine it is recommended that the in@@ comes of di@@ dan@@ os@@ ine and as@@ en@@ ase apart at least one hour apart ( see An@@ ta@@ zi@@ da below ) .
therefore , in combination with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) and k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) , no dose adjustment is required in combination with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) and k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) .
the treatment with E@@ fa@@ vi@@ ren@@ z in combination with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r is not recommended as exposure of both prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors would decrease .
the effects of ne@@ vi@@ rap@@ in on other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors and existing limited data suggest that ne@@ vi@@ rap@@ ins may reduce the serum concentration of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r .
if these drugs should be used at the same time , caution is advised , because Del@@ avi@@ r@@ dine could be less effective because of the reduced or possibly sub@@ therapeutic plasma levels .
if these drugs are used together , caution is advised ; a thorough clinical and vi@@ ro@@ logical monitoring should be made as a precise predic@@ tion of the effect of the combination of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r on Del@@ avi@@ r@@ dine is difficult .
the simultaneous administration of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin led to an increase in plasma concentration ( AU@@ C ) of ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin by 19@@ 3 % , resulting in a rise in side effects associated with ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin .
if it is necessary for clinical reasons to admini@@ ster ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin together with as@@ en@@ ase , a reduction in the dosage of ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin will be at least half of the recommended dose , although there are no clinical data available .
pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic studies with er@@ y@@ thro@@ my@@ cin combined with er@@ y@@ thro@@ my@@ cin were not carried out , however , the plasma levels of both drugs could be increased in the case of simultaneous administration .
the simultaneous application of twice daily 700 mg of Fos@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and 100 mg of k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole once daily led to an increase of C@@ max of k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole in plasma by 25 % and the AU@@ C ( 0 @-@ τ ) to 2.@@ 69@@ fold compared to the value observed once a day without simultaneous use of Fos@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
other medicines listed below , including substrates , inhibit@@ ors or C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 In@@ duc@@ tors , may lead to interactions when they are used together with as@@ gener@@ ase .
patients should therefore be monitored for toxic reactions that are associated with these drugs if they are used in combination with as@@ gener@@ ase .
based on the data of other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors it is advisable that ant@@ acids are not taken at the same time as as@@ sh@@ re@@ ase as it can come to res@@ or@@ ption disorders .
the simultaneous use of anti@@ conv@@ ul@@ ants known as enzyme ( phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , phen@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al , carb@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine ) , with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , can lead to a degradation of the plasma levels of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r .
serum concentrations of calcium channel block@@ ers such as am@@ lo@@ di@@ pin , dil@@ ti@@ az@@ em , ri@@ pen@@ di@@ pin , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pin , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pin and ver@@ ap@@ am@@ il can be increased by 10 through am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , thereby increasing the activity and toxic@@ ity of these drugs .
the simultaneous intake of as@@ en@@ ase can significantly increase the plasma concentrations and strengthen associated side effects associated with P@@ DE@@ 5 inhibit@@ ors including hyp@@ ot@@ en@@ sion , visual disturbances and pri@@ ap@@ ism ( see section 4.4 ) .
in a clinical study , where k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r was given 100 mg capsules twice a day together with 50 µ@@ g flu@@ ti@@ cas@@ on@@ pro@@ pion@@ ate in@@ tran@@ as@@ al ( 4 times a day ) , the Flu@@ ti@@ cas@@ on@@ pro@@ pion@@ ate plasma levels increased significantly , while the endo@@ genous cor@@ ti@@ sol decreased by about 86 % ( 90 % confidence interval 82 to 89 % ) .
as a result , the simultaneous gift of as@@ en@@ ase with k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r is not recommended along with these glu@@ co@@ cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ids , unless the potential benefits of treatment out@@ weigh the risk of systemic cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oid@@ al effects ( see section 4.4 ) .
in the case of H@@ MG Co@@ A reduc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ ors such as Lov@@ e@@ atin and Sim@@ v@@ ast@@ atin , whose inter@@ pol@@ ation is strongly dependent on C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , pronounced increases in plasma levels are expected while ad@@ minist@@ ering as@@ en@@ ase .
since plasma level increases of these H@@ MG Co@@ A reduc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ ors can lead to my@@ opathy , including a rh@@ ub@@ dom@@ y@@ oly@@ sis , the combined use of these drugs with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is not recommended .
more frequent monitoring of therapeutic concentrations to stabili@@ zation of the levels is recommended , since the plasma concentrations of cy@@ clos@@ por@@ ine , rap@@ am@@ y@@ cin and tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus can be increased with simultaneous administration of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( see section 4.4 ) .
therefore , as@@ gener@@ ase may not be used together with Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am taken or@@ ally ( see Section 4.3 ) , while with simultaneous use of as@@ en@@ ase with par@@ enter@@ al mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am caution is required .
data for simultaneous use of par@@ enter@@ al mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am with other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors indicate a possible increase in the plasma levels of mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am around 3 to 4 times .
if meth@@ ad@@ one is administered together with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , patients should therefore be monitored on O@@ pi@@ ate withdrawal symptoms , especially if there are also low doses of k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r administered .
because of the low reliability of historical compar@@ isons , no recommendation can be given at the moment , such as the am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r dosage , if am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is administered at the same time with meth@@ ad@@ one .
with simultaneous dispens@@ ation of war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants together with as@@ gen@@ ase an increased control of IN@@ R ( International Standard R@@ atio ) is recommended because of the possibility of weak@@ ening or strengthening the anti@@ th@@ rom@@ bot@@ ic effect ( see section 4.4 ) .
the effect of an additional administration of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r on hormon@@ al contrac@@ ep@@ tives is not predictable , so alternative methods for contrac@@ eption are also recommended .
careful monitoring of the therapeutic effects and side effects of tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ depres@@ s@@ ants ( for example Des@@ i@@ pra@@ mine and Nor@@ tr@@ yp@@ ti@@ lin ) is recommended with simultaneous dispens@@ ation of as@@ en@@ ase ( see section 4.4 ) .
during pregnancy , this drug may only be used after careful weighing of the potential benefits for the mother in comparison to the possible risks for the fet@@ us .
in the milk of lac@@ tation rats , am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r @-@ related substances have been detected , but it is not known whether or not am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is transferred to breast milk in humans .
a reproduction study of pregnant rats , given to am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r in the uter@@ us until the end of the lac@@ tation period , showed a dimin@@ ished increase of the 12 body weight during breast@@ feeding .
further development of the seed , including fertility and reproductive capacity , was not affected by the administration of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r to the mother animal .
the harm@@ lessness of as@@ gen@@ ase has been studied in adults and in children over 4 years in controlled clinical trials in combination with various other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines .
most of the side effects associated with A@@ gener@@ ase treatment were mild to moderate , early on and rarely lead to treatment .
many of these events are not clari@@ fied whether they are related to the intake of drugs or any other medicine used at the same time , or whether they are a consequence of the underlying disease .
most of the side effects listed below date from two clinical trials ( PRO@@ AB@@ 300@@ 1 , PRO@@ AB@@ 300@@ 6 ) , in which patients receiving prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors received 1200 mg of as@@ gener@@ ase twice daily .
events ( grade 2 to 4 ) , which were evaluated by the investig@@ ators as in connection with the study medication and performed in more than 1 % of the patients , as well as laboratory changes occurring in the treatment ( grade 3 to 4 ) are listed .
anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy was associated with a re@@ distribution of body fat ( Li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy ) in HIV patients , including loss of peripheral and peripheral fatty tissue , increased intra@@ abdominal and vis@@ cer@@ al adi@@ pose tissue , hyper@@ trop@@ hi@@ e of breasts and dor@@ so@@ cervi@@ cal fat accumulation ( Sti@@ ern@@ es ) .
under 113 anti@@ retro@@ viral infections not treated with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r in combination with lam@@ iv@@ u@@ dine / zi@@ do@@ v@@ u@@ dine for a mean duration of 36 weeks , only one case ( Sti@@ ern@@ ack ) ( &lt; 1 % ) was observed .
in the study PRO@@ J@@ IA 300@@ 6 patients with 2@@ 45 N@@ R@@ TI@@ - treated patients under Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r 7 cases ( 3 % ) compared to 27 cases ( 11 % ) in 24@@ 1 patients under in@@ din@@ avi@@ r , in combination with different N@@ R@@ TI@@ s over a mean duration of 56 weeks ( p &lt; 0.@@ 001 ) .
r@@ ashes were usually mild to moderate , er@@ y@@ them@@ at@@ ous or mac@@ ab@@ lo@@ id@@ ous nature , with or without it@@ ching and occurred spontaneously during the second week of treatment and disappeared spontaneously within two weeks without the treatment having to be stopped with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r .
cases of oste@@ o@@ arthritis were reported in particular in patients with generally known risk factors , advanced HIV disease or long @-@ term application of an anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy ( ART ) .
in HIV @-@ infected patients with severe immune defect , an anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy ( ART ) may develop an inflammatory response to asy@@ mpt@@ om@@ atic or residual opportun@@ istic infections ( see section 4.4 ) .
with PI pre @-@ treated patients receiving 600 mg as@@ gener@@ a twice daily along with low dose ri@@ k@@ rit@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) , the type and frequency of adverse events ( grade 2 to 4 ) and laboratory changes ( Grade 3 and 4 ) were comparable to those who received al@@ ase with low dos@@ ed k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , very often occurred .
in case of over@@ dose , the patient should observe signs of an in@@ toxic@@ ation ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) if necessary , to initiate necessary supporting measures .
am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r bin@@ ds to the active centre of the HIV @-@ 1 prot@@ ease and thereby prevents the process of viral G@@ ag@@ - and g@@ ag @-@ pol@@ - poly@@ prot@@ ein@@ formation with the result of a formation of un@@ ripe , non infectious viral particles .
the anti@@ viral activity of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r in vitro against HIV @-@ 1 II@@ IB was studied both in acute and chron@@ ically infected lymp@@ ho@@ blast cell lines ( MT @-@ 4 , CE@@ M @-@ C@@ CR@@ F , H@@ 9 ) as well as peripheral blood lymp@@ ho@@ cytes .
the 50 % inhi@@ bit concentration ( IC@@ 50 ) of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is in the range of 0,@@ 0@@ 12 to 0.@@ 08 µ@@ M in infected cells and is 0.@@ 41 µ@@ M in chron@@ ically infected cells
the connection between the activity of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r against HIV @-@ 1 in vitro and in@@ hibition of HIV @-@ 1 rep@@ lication in humans is not yet defined .
in the treatment of anti@@ retro@@ viral non @-@ pre@@ treated patients with the currently approved Fos@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r @-@ dos@@ ages , as with other Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r @-@ based treatment regi@@ mens with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , the described mut@@ ations were rarely observed .
at sixteen of 4@@ 34 anti@@ retro@@ viral non @-@ vir@@ ally untreated patients who received 700@@ mg of Fos@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r with 100@@ mg of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice a day in the ES@@ S@@ 100@@ 7@@ 32 trial , a vi@@ ro@@ logical failure occurred up to week 48 , whereby 14 Isol@@ ate could be gen@@ otyp@@ ically examined .
gen@@ otyp@@ ic analysis of the isolation of 13 out of 14 children , in which a vi@@ ro@@ logical failure occurred within 59 patients with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , showed resistance patterns similar to those in adults .
L@@ 10@@ F / I / V , V@@ 11@@ I , I@@ 13@@ V , K@@ 20@@ R , V@@ 32@@ I , L@@ 33@@ F , E@@ 34@@ Q , I@@ 54@@ L , D@@ 60@@ E , I@@ 6@@ 2@@ V , D@@ 60@@ E , V@@ 77@@ I , V@@ 8@@ 2@@ A / I , I@@ 6@@ 2@@ A / I , I@@ 8@@ 4@@ V , I@@ 85@@ V , L@@ 90@@ M and I@@ 9@@ 3@@ L / M .
in the AP@@ V@@ 300@@ 03 and its extension of AP@@ V@@ 300@@ 05 ( 700 mg of Fos@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / 100 mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily : n = 107 ) , patients treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors performed over 96 weeks following prot@@ ease inhibit@@ or mut@@ ations :
gen@@ otyp@@ ic resistance tests based on gen@@ otyp@@ ic resistance tests can be used to estimate the activity of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r or Fos@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r in patients with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ or @-@ resistant isol@@ ates .
the current ( July 2006 ) AN@@ RS @-@ AC @-@ 11 algorithm for Fos@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r defines resistance as the presence of mut@@ ations V@@ 32@@ I + 14@@ 7@@ a / V , or I@@ 50@@ V , or at least 4 of the following mut@@ ations L@@ 10@@ F / I , I@@ 6@@ 2@@ V , V@@ 8@@ 2@@ A / C / S / T / V , I@@ 8@@ 4@@ V and L@@ 90@@ M in conjunction with an increased phen@@ otyp@@ ic resistance to Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r and a reduced probability of a vi@@ ro@@ logical response ( resistance ) .
the conclusions regarding the relevance of certain mut@@ ations or mut@@ ation patterns may be subject to alterations by additional data , and it is recommended to always draw up the current interpretation systems for analy@@ zing the results of resistance tests .
phen@@ otyp@@ ic analysis systems based on phen@@ otyp@@ ic resistance tests can be used in combination with gen@@ otyp@@ ic data to estimate the activity of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r or Fos@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r in patients with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ or @-@ resistant isol@@ ates .
companies that drive diagnostic resistance tests have developed clin@@ ically @-@ phen@@ otyp@@ ic cut @-@ offs for F@@ PV / R@@ TV which can be used to interpret the results of resistance tests .
each of these four genetic samples with reduced sensitivity to am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r creates a certain amount of cross resistance to Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , but the sensitivity to in@@ din@@ avi@@ r , nel@@ fin@@ avi@@ r and sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r remains generally preserved .
there are currently data to cross resistance between am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors for all 4 Fos@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r resistance paths , either alone or in combination with other mut@@ ations .
on the basis of twenty @-@ five anti@@ retro@@ viral non @-@ vir@@ ally treated patients , in which a fossil @-@ viol@@ a @-@ containing scheme failed ( one of which proved resistance to Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r and sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r at the beginning of treatment ) , in@@ din@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( one of 25 isol@@ ates ) , sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r ( three of 24 isol@@ ates ) and Ti@@ den@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( four out of 24 isol@@ ates ) .
on the other hand , am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r maintains its activity against some other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ or @-@ resistant isol@@ ates ; the preservation of this activity appears to be dependent on the number and type of resistance mut@@ ations in the isol@@ ates .
the early departure of a failing therapy is recommended in order to keep the accumulation of a variety of mut@@ ations within limits , which can adver@@ sely affect subsequent treatment .
the evidence of the efficacy of as@@ gener@@ ase in combination with k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg twice daily is based on the study PRO@@ 300@@ 17 , a random@@ ized open study conducted with PI pre@@ treated adults according to vi@@ ro@@ logical failure ( 100 mg twice daily ) and Nu@@ cle@@ osi@@ dan@@ u@@ ga ( N@@ R@@ TI ) or standard therapy ( standard of care , SO@@ C ) with a PI , predominantly with low @-@ dos@@ ed k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
one hundred and sixty @-@ three ( n = 16@@ 3 ) patients with proven virus sensitivity to as@@ en@@ ase , at least another PI and at least one N@@ R@@ TI were included in the partial study A of PRO@@ 300@@ 17 .
the primary analysis showed the non @-@ inf@@ eri@@ ority of AP@@ V / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r compared to the SO@@ C PI group in the viral load ( HIV @-@ 1 RNA ) in the viral load ( HIV @-@ 1 RNA ) in the plasma after 16 weeks , with a non @-@ sub@@ cut@@ aneous threshold of 0.4 log@@ 10 copies / ml .
the evidence of the efficacy of un@@ brid@@ led ast@@ er@@ ase is based on two un@@ controlled trials with a total of 28@@ 8 HIV @-@ infected children aged 2 to 18 , of which 152 were treated with PI .
in the studies , as@@ en@@ ase solution for intake and capsules was examined three times a day , 20 mg / kg three times a day , 20 mg / kg twice daily and 2@@ 2.5 mg / kg twice a day , whereby the majority of patients received 20 mg / kg twice daily .
there was no low dose of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r at the same time ; the majority of patients treated with PI had previously received at least one ( 78 % ) or two ( 42 % ) of the N@@ R@@ TI@@ s administered together with A@@ gener@@ ase .
after 48 weeks approximately 25 % of patients enrolled in the study had a plasma @-@ HIV @-@ 1 RNA concentration &lt; 10,000 copies / ml and 9 % &lt; 400 copies / ml for a medi@@ an increase of the CD@@ 4 cell count of 26 cells / mm ³ ( n = 74 ) compared to the initial value .
19 B@@ ased on this data , the anticipated benefits of &quot; un@@ ble@@ oo@@ ster@@ tem &quot; am@@ en@@ ase should be considered in therapy optimisation with PI pre @-@ treated children .
after oral administration , the mean duration ( T@@ max ) to the maximum serum concentration of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is approximately 1 to 2 hours for the capsule and about 0.5 to 1 hour for the solution .
50 % increase for C@@ max by 30 % if Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) was administered together with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) .
the administration of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r with a meal leads to a 25 % decrease in AU@@ C but has no effect on the concentration of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r 12 hours after dosage ( C@@ 12 ) .
for this reason , the minimum concentration in the Ste@@ ady State ( C@@ min , ss ) remained un@@ influenced by food intake , although the simultaneous food intake was influenced by the extent and rate of absorption .
the apparent distribution volume amounts to approximately 430 l ( 6 l / kg for a body weight of 70 kg ) and can be closed to a large distribution volume as well as an un@@ hin@@ dered penetration of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r from the blood@@ stream into the tissue .
this change leads to a decrease in the total concentration of the active substance in the plasma , whereby the amount of un@@ bound am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , which represents the active part , probably remains unchanged .
while the absolute concentration of un@@ bound am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r remains constant , the percentage of free active components fluctu@@ ates during the dosing interval , depending on the total drug concentration in the Ste@@ ady State through the range of C@@ max , ss to C@@ min , ss .
therefore , drugs that indu@@ ce or inhi@@ bit C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 or represent a substrate of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 may be administered cau@@ ti@@ ously if given at the same time as as@@ gener@@ ase ( see Sec@@ tion@@ 15.@@ 4.3 , 4.4 and 4.5 ) .
the gift of as@@ en@@ ase capsules , either 20 mg / kg twice or 15 mg / kg three times a day , leads to a similar daily am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r exposure as in adults with a dose of 1200 mg twice daily .
am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is 14 % less bio@@ available than from capsules . therefore , as@@ en@@ ase solution and as@@ en@@ ase capsules are not inter@@ changeable on a milli@@ gram basis .
also , the ren@@ al clearance of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r is neg@@ li@@ gible , therefore the effect of a kidney function disorder should be low on the elimination of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
these treatment schemes lead to am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r plasma levels comparable to those obtained from healthy volunteers following a dose of 1200 mg of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r twice a day without the simultaneous administration of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
in long @-@ term studies for carcin@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity of mice and rats occ@@ ured in male animals h@@ ep@@ ato@@ cellular aden@@ omas in dos@@ ages , which correspon@@ ded to the 2.0 @-@ fold ( mice ) or 3.8 @-@ fold ( rat ) of exposure to humans , after twice daily dosage of 1200 mg of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r .
the 21 underlying mechanism for the emergence of h@@ ep@@ ato@@ cellular aden@@ omas and carcin@@ omas was not yet clari@@ fied and the relevance of these observed effects for humans is unclear .
however , there were little indications of the clinical relevance of these findings from the existing exposure data on humans , both from clinical studies and therapeutic applications .
in a standard battery of in @-@ vitro and in @-@ vitro gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity tests , the bacterial reverse mut@@ ation tests ( Am@@ es test ) , mouse lymph@@ oma test , micro@@ kernel test of rats and chromos@@ om@@ al ab@@ err@@ ations tests on human peripheral lymp@@ ho@@ cytes contained , am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r was neither mut@@ agen nor gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic .
this liver toxic@@ ity can be monitored and proven in the clinical routine by measuring AST , AL@@ T and the activity of alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase .
so far , no significant liver toxic@@ ity in patients has been observed in clinical studies , neither during ad@@ minist@@ ering as@@ en@@ oid nor after treatment .
studies of toxic@@ ity in juven@@ iles , which were treated at an age of 4 days , showed a high mortality in both the control animals and the animals treated with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r .
in a systemic plasma exposition , which was significantly lower ( rab@@ bits ) or not significantly higher ( rats ) than expected exposure to humans , however , a number of minor changes including thy@@ mus and minor skel@@ etal changes were observed indicating a delayed development .
24 If as@@ en@@ oid capsules are used without the increased added of k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( boo@@ sting ) , higher doses of as@@ en@@ ase ( 1200 mg twice daily ) must be applied .
the recommended dose for as@@ en@@ ase capsules is 20 mg of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / kg body weight twice daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines up to a daily dose of 24@@ 00 mg of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r which should not be exceeded ( see section 5.1 ) .
the simultaneous application should be conducted with caution in patients with low or light liver dysfunction , in patients with severe liver dys@@ functions , they are contra@@ indicated ( see Section 4.3 ) .
26 For some medicines that may cause serious or life @-@ threatening side effects such as carb@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine , phen@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ depres@@ s@@ ants and war@@ far@@ in ( under supervision of the International Standard R@@ atio ) , methods are available to determine the drug concentration .
as@@ gen@@ ase should be set to 27 if a rash of systemic or allergic symptoms is accompanied or the mu@@ cous membranes are involved ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) .
an increased risk of li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy was associated with individual factors , such as higher age , and drug @-@ related factors , such as prolonged anti@@ retro@@ viral treatment and associated metabolic disorders .
it has been shown that Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in causes a 82 % reduction in the AU@@ C of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , which can lead to a vi@@ ro@@ logical failure and a resistance development .
50 % increase for C@@ max by 30 % if Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) was administered in combination with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r capsules ( 600 mg twice daily ) .
the C@@ min values of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r in plasma ( 600 mg twice daily ) with Kal@@ et@@ ra ( 400 mg Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r + 100 mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily ) are approximately 40 to 50 % lower than if am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) is administered twice daily in combination with 100 mg of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
dosage recommendations for the simultaneous administration of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and Kal@@ et@@ ra can not be given , however , it is recommended a close monitoring because the effectiveness and safety of this combination is not known .
the treatment with E@@ fa@@ vi@@ ren@@ z in combination with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r is not recommended as exposure of both prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors would decrease .
if these drugs are used together , caution is advised ; a thorough clinical and vi@@ ro@@ logical monitoring should be made as a precise predic@@ tion of the effect of the combination of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r on Del@@ avi@@ r@@ dine is difficult .
if it is necessary for clinical reasons to admini@@ ster ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin together with as@@ en@@ ase , a reduction in the dosage of ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin will be at least half of the recommended dose 31 , although there are no clinical data available .
serum concentrations of calcium channel block@@ ers such as am@@ lo@@ di@@ pin , dil@@ ti@@ az@@ em , ri@@ pen@@ di@@ pin , ni@@ o@@ pin , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pin , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pin , ni@@ p@@ am@@ il can be increased by am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , which may increase the activity and toxic@@ ity of this drug .
in a clinical study , where k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r was given 100 mg capsules twice a day together with 50 µ@@ g flu@@ ti@@ cas@@ on@@ pro@@ pion@@ ate in@@ tran@@ as@@ al ( 4 times a day ) , the Flu@@ ti@@ cas@@ on@@ pro@@ pion@@ ate plasma levels increased significantly , while the endo@@ genous cor@@ ti@@ sol decreased by about 86 % ( 90 % confidence interval 82 to 89 % ) .
with simultaneous dispens@@ ation of war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants together with as@@ gen@@ ase an increased control of IN@@ R ( International Standard R@@ atio ) is recommended because of the possibility of weak@@ ening or strengthening the anti@@ th@@ rom@@ bot@@ ic effect ( see section 4.4 ) .
the simultaneous administration of or@@ tho @-@ nov@@ um 1 / 35 ( 0.0@@ 35 mg of eth@@ in@@ yl est@@ radi@@ ol plus 1.0 mg Nor@@ eth@@ in@@ dron ) led to a decrease in AU@@ C and C@@ min of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r by 22 % respectively .
during pregnancy , this drug may only be used after careful weighing of the possible benefits for the mother in comparison with possible risks for the fet@@ us .
a reproduction study of pregnant rats , given to am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r in the uter@@ us until the end of the lac@@ tation period , showed a dimin@@ ished increase in body weight during breast@@ feeding .
the harm@@ lessness of as@@ gen@@ ase has been studied in adults and in children over 4 years in controlled clinical trials in combination with various other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines .
in case of over@@ dose , the patient should observe signs of an in@@ toxic@@ ation ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) if necessary , to initiate necessary supporting measures .
the anti@@ viral activity of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r in vitro against HIV @-@ 1 II@@ IB was studied both in acute and chron@@ ically infected lymp@@ ho@@ blast cell lines ( MT @-@ 4 , CE@@ M @-@ C@@ CR@@ F , H@@ 9 ) and peripheral blood lymp@@ ho@@ cytes .
the 50 % inhi@@ bit concentration ( IC@@ 50 ) of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is in the range of 0,@@ 0@@ 12 to 0.@@ 08 µ@@ M in infected cells and is 0.@@ 41 µ@@ M for chron@@ ically infected cells ( 1 µ@@ M = 0.@@ 50 µ@@ g / ml ) .
on the other hand , am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r maintains its activity against some other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ or @-@ resistant isol@@ ates ; the preservation of this activity appears to be dependent on the number and type of resistance mut@@ ations in the isol@@ ates .
based on this data , the expected benefits of &quot; un@@ ble@@ oo@@ ster@@ tem &quot; am@@ en@@ ase should be taken into account in the treatment optimisation with PI pre @-@ treated children .
while the absolute concentration of un@@ bound am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r remains constant , the percentage of free active components fluctu@@ ates during the dosing interval , depending on the total drug concentration in the Ste@@ ady State through the range of C@@ max , ss to C@@ min , ss ..
therefore , drugs that indu@@ ce or inhi@@ bit C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 or represent a substrate of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 may be administered cau@@ ti@@ ously if given at the same time as as@@ gener@@ ase ( see Sec@@ tion@@ 15.@@ 4.3 , 4.4 and 4.5 ) .
also the ren@@ al clearance of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r is neg@@ li@@ gible ; therefore the effect of a ren@@ al dysfunction is likely to be low on the elimination of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .

studies of toxic@@ ity in juven@@ iles , which were treated at an age of 4 days , showed a high mortality in both the control animals and the animals treated with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r .
these results indicate that in juven@@ iles , the metabolism path@@ ways are not yet fully mature , so that am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r or other critical components of the formulation ( z ) .
as@@ part@@ ase solution for intake is indicated in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines to treat HIV @-@ 1 @-@ infected , prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors ( PI ) -@@ treated adults and children over 4 years .
the benefits of using k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r &quot; geb@@ oo@@ ster@@ ter &quot; as@@ gener@@ ase solution for intake was not occupied with patients treated with PI nor with PI pre @-@ treated patients .
the bio@@ availability of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r as a solution to intake is 14 % lower than am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r as capsule ; therefore , as@@ en@@ ase capsules and solution for intake on one milli@@ gram per milli@@ gram base are not inter@@ changeable ( see Section 5.2 ) .
patients should be able to swal@@ low the capsules once they are able to stop taking the solution ( see section 4.4 ) .
the recommended dose for A@@ ga@@ ase solution is 17 mg ( 1.1 ml ) of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / kg body weight three times a day in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines up to a daily dose of 28@@ 00 mg of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r which should not be exceeded ( see section 5.1 ) .
in addition , as there is no dose recommendation for the simultaneous use of as@@ gener@@ ase solution for inhal@@ ing and low dos@@ ed k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , this combination may be avoided in these patient populations .
although dosage adjustment for am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is not considered necessary , an application of as@@ en@@ ase solution is contra@@ indicated in patients with kidney failure ( see Section 4.3 ) .
due to the potential risk of toxic reaction as a result of high prop@@ yl@@ gly@@ col content , A@@ gener@@ ase is contra@@ indicated for the use in infants and children under 4 years , in pregnant women , in patients with reduced liver function or liver failure and in patients with kidney failure .
simultaneous administration may lead to a competitive in@@ hibition of this drug metabolism and may cause serious and / or life @-@ threatening side effects such as heart rhythm disorders ( z ) .
patients should be advised that atri@@ al or any other anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy does not lead to a cure of HIV infection and that they will continue to develop opportun@@ istic infections or other complications of HIV infection .
the current anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy including treatment with as@@ sh@@ re@@ ase does not prevent the risk of 47 transmission of HIV to others through sexual contact or contamination with blood .
for some medicines that may cause serious or life @-@ threatening side effects , such as carb@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine , phen@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ depres@@ s@@ ants and war@@ far@@ in ( under supervision of the International Standard R@@ atio ) , methods are available to determine the drug concentration .
as@@ part@@ ase should be stopped for a long time if a rash of systemic or allergic symptoms is accompanied or the mu@@ cous membranes are involved ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) .
an increased risk of li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy was associated with individual factors , such as higher age , and with drug @-@ 49 dependent factors , such as prolonged anti@@ retro@@ viral treatment and associated metabolic disorders .
in hem@@ ophi@@ lic patients ( type A and B ) treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , reports about an increase of bleeding including spontaneous cut@@ aneous hem@@ at@@ oma and hem@@ o@@ thro@@ sis are present .
it has been shown that Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in causes a 82 % reduction in the AU@@ C of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , which can lead to a vi@@ ro@@ logical failure and a resistance development .
50 % increase for C@@ max by 30 % if Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) was administered in combination with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r capsules ( 600 mg twice daily ) .
the simultaneous intake of as@@ en@@ ase can considerably increase the plasma concentrations and result in associated adverse events associated with P@@ DE@@ 5 inhibit@@ ors including hyp@@ ot@@ en@@ sion , visual disturbances and pri@@ ap@@ ism ( see section 4.4 ) .
based on data on 54 other C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors , Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am significantly increases plasma concentrations of Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am following oral administration of Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am .

in all studies , Al@@ dar@@ a was more effective than the placebo . • In the treatment of war@@ ts in the genital area , the complete recovery rate in all four main studies was 15 % to 52 % in patients treated with placebo . • The results of both studies on bas@@ al cell carcin@@ omas showed a complete recovery rate of 66 % to 80 % in patients treated with Al@@ dar@@ a compared to 0 % to 3 % in the placebo group .
the most common side effects of Al@@ dar@@ a ( observed in more than 1 of 10 patients ) are reactions to the application point of the cream ( pain or it@@ ching ) .
clin@@ ically typical , non @-@ hyper@@ trop@@ hic , non @-@ hyper@@ trop@@ hic ker@@ at@@ oses ( A@@ K@@ s ) in the face or scal@@ p in immun@@ o@@ competent adults , if the size or number of lesi@@ ons limit the efficacy and / or acceptance of cr@@ yo@@ therapy and other topical treatment options are contra@@ indicated or less suitable .
Monday , Wednesday and Friday or Tuesday , Thursday and Saturday ) before bed@@ time , and leave for 6 to 10 hours on the skin .
the treatment with i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine is continued until all visible genital war@@ ts have disappeared in the genital or per@@ ic@@ ular area , or up to a maximum of 16 weeks per treatment period .
an interruption in the course of treatment described above should be considered when intensive local inflammatory reactions occur ( see section 4.4 ) or if an infection is observed in the treatment area .
in case of follow @-@ up examination 4 to 8 weeks after the second treatment period the treated lesi@@ ons are only completely healed , another therapy should be started ( see section 4.4 ) .
if a dose is om@@ itted , the patient should apply the cream as soon as he / she notices this and then continue with the usual therapy plan .
apply i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine cream in a thin layer and rub in the puri@@ fied , infected skin area until the cream is fully absorbed .
it should be considered in these patients a reduction in the benefits of treatment with i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine and the risk associated with a possible wor@@ sen@@ ing of auto@@ immune disease .
it should be considered in these patients the benefit of a treatment with i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine and the risk associated with possible organ rejection or gra@@ ft versus host response .
in other studies , in which no daily pre@@ h@@ auth@@ y@@ gi@@ ene was performed , two cases of severe phi@@ mo@@ sis were observed and one case with a cord leading to circumcision .
when using i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream in higher than recommended doses , there is an increased risk of severe local skin irritation ( see section 4.2 . ) In rare cases , severe local skin irritation was observed in rare cases , which necess@@ itated a treatment and / or caused temporary physical impairment .
in cases where such reactions occurred at the exit of the ureth@@ ra , some women had difficulty passing urine that necess@@ itated an emergency cath@@ eter@@ isation and treatment of the affected area .
for the application of i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream directly following a treatment with other cut@@ aneous injection methods for the treatment of external genital war@@ ts in the genital and perio@@ don@@ tal area , no clinical experience has yet to occur .
limited data suggest an increased rate of incidence reduction in HIV @-@ positive patients , but I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream has shown a lower effectiveness in this group of patients regarding the elimination of the ple@@ ats .
the treatment of bas@@ al cell carcin@@ oma with i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine within 1 cm around the ey@@ eli@@ ds , nose , lips or hair@@ line has not been studied .
local skin reactions are common , but the intensity of these reactions generally decreases during therapy or the reactions proceed after conclusion of treatment with i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream .
if it is necessary because of the patient &apos;s discomfort or due to the sever@@ ity of the local skin reactions , a treatment break can be made of several days .
the clinical outcome of the therapy can be assessed after the regeneration of the treated skin about 12 weeks after the end of treatment .
since there are currently no data on long @-@ term healing rates of more than 36 months after treatment , other suitable therapy forms should be considered in the case of super@@ fici@@ ally bas@@ al cell carcin@@ omas .
in patients with recur@@ rent and pre @-@ treated BC@@ Cs no clinical experience is present , therefore the application is not recommended in case of pre @-@ treated tum@@ ors .
data from an open clinical trial suggest that there is a lower probability of response to i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine therapy in large tum@@ ors ( &gt; 7.@@ 25 c@@ m2 ) .
i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine was not examined for the treatment of ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ oses on ey@@ eli@@ ds , inside the nose or ears or on the lip area within the lips .
there are only very limited data about the use of i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine for the treatment of ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ oses in anatom@@ ical areas outside the face and scal@@ p .
the available data on ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ ose on for@@ ear@@ ms and hands does not support the effectiveness of this use , therefore such an application is not recommended .
local skin reactions often occur , but these reactions usually decrease in intensity during therapy or go back after the treatment with i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream .
if the local skin reactions cause a lot of discomfort to the patient or are very strong , treatment may be suspended for a few days .
from the data of an open clinical study , patients with more than 8 lesi@@ ons showed a lower total cure rate than patients with less than 8 lesi@@ ons .
due to the immun@@ o @-@ stimulating properties , I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream should be used with care in patients receiving immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive treatment ( see 4.4 ) .
animal studies have no direct or indirect effects on pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , child@@ birth or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see 5.3 ) .
although quanti@@ fiable serum levels ( &gt; 5@@ ng / ml ) are not quanti@@ fiable after a single topical application , no recommendation can be given during breast@@ feeding .
the most frequently communicated and possibly with the application of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream related side effects in the studies with three times weekly treatment were local reactions at the place of treatment of the F@@ eig@@ ni@@ ces ( 3@@ 3.@@ 7 % of patients treated with i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine ) .
among the most frequently reported and as likely or possibly with the application of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream related side effects include discomfort on the application place with a frequency of 28.@@ 1 % .
the side effects reported by 185 with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream from a placebo @-@ controlled clinical study of phase III reported side effects are shown below .
the most common , probably or possibly associated with the application of i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream in the context , were in these studies a response to the application location ( 22 % of patients treated with i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine ) .
the side effects reported by 25@@ 2 in placebo @-@ controlled clinical studies of phase III with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream treated patients with ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ ose are listed below .
according to the study plan , the evaluation of the clinical signs indicated that in these placebo @-@ controlled clinical studies with three times weekly treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream frequently occurred local skin reactions including er@@ y@@ them ( 61 % ) , ex@@ cre@@ ori@@ ation / abor@@ tion / shed ( 23 % ) and e@@ dem@@ a ( 14 % ) ( see section 4.4 ) .
according to the study plan , the evaluation of the clinical signs revealed that in these studies five times weekly treatment with i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine cream very often resulted in severe er@@ y@@ thema ( 31 % ) , severe ero@@ sions ( 13 % ) , and heavy f@@ loc@@ cul@@ ation and inc@@ iner@@ ation ( 19 % ) .
in clinical studies for the treatment of i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine for the treatment of ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ ose , al@@ op@@ eci@@ a was detected with a frequency of 0.4 % ( 5 / 12@@ 14 ) at the treatment centre or in the surrounding area .
the in@@ adver@@ tent one @-@ time oral recording of 200 mg of i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od , which corresponds to the content of about 16 bags , might cause nausea , vom@@ iting , headache , my@@ al@@ gia and fever .
the clin@@ ically serious side effect that occurred after several oral doses of &gt; 200 mg consisted in hyp@@ ot@@ ony , which norm@@ alized after oral or intraven@@ ous inj@@ ections .
in a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic study , systemic concentrations of alpha interfer@@ ons and other cy@@ tok@@ ines were detected after the topical application of i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine .
in 3 pi@@ vot@@ al phase 3 efficacy studies , efficacy in the treatment of an i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine treatment over 16 weeks of placebo treatment was clearly superior .
at 60 % of the total of 119 patients with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od treated patients were completely healed ; this was the case at 20 % of the 105 with placebo @-@ treated patients ( 95 % CI ) :
a complete healing could be achieved in 23 % of 157 patients treated with i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine compared to 5 % of 161 male patients treated with placebo ( 95 % CI ) :
efficacy of i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine in five @-@ colour application per week over 6 weeks was studied in two double @-@ blind , placebo @-@ controlled clinical studies .
the target tum@@ ors were hist@@ ologically confirmed single primary super@@ fici@@ al bas@@ al cell carcin@@ omas with a minimum size of 0.5 c@@ m2 and a maximum diameter of 2 cm .
data from an open , un@@ controlled long @-@ term study after four years showed that approximately 7@@ 9.@@ 3 % &#91; 95 % CI ( 7@@ 3.@@ 7 % , 8@@ 4.@@ 9 % ) of all patients treated were clin@@ ically cured and this remained for 48 months .
the efficacy of i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine in three weeks of treatment in one or two treatment periods of 4 weeks , interrupted by a four @-@ week treatment period , was examined in two double @-@ blind , placebo @-@ controlled clinical studies .
patients had clin@@ ically typical , visible , dis@@ crete , non @-@ hyper@@ trop@@ hic lesi@@ ons within a related 25 c@@ m2 of large treatment area on the hair@@ y scal@@ p or face .
the annual data from two combined observation studies indicate a recur@@ rence rate of 27 % ( 35 / 128 patients ) for patients with clinical healing after one or two treatment periods .
the approved indications for external clin@@ ations , ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ ose and Super@@ sti@@ el bas@@ al cell carcin@@ oma usually do not appear in pa@@ edi@@ atric patients and were therefore not examined .
Al@@ dar@@ a Creme was studied in four random@@ ised , double @-@ blind placebo @-@ controlled trials on children aged 2 to 15 with M@@ oll@@ us@@ cum con@@ ta@@ gi@@ os@@ um ( I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od n = 5@@ 76 , placebo n = 3@@ 13 ) .
the efficacy of i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine could not be shown in these studies in the dos@@ ages investigated there ( 3x / week for a period of ≤ 16 weeks , respectively .
a minimum systemic acceptance of the 5 % i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine cream through the skin of 58 patients with ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ ose was observed during the three @-@ week application during 16 weeks .
the highest drug concentrations in serum at the end of week 16 were observed between 9 and 12 hours and amounted to 0.1 , 0.2 and 1.6 ng / ml in the face ( 12.@@ 5 mg , 1 dispos@@ able p@@ ou@@ ch ) , on the scal@@ p ( 25 mg , 2 bags ) and on the hands / arms ( 75 mg , 6 bags ) .
the calculated half @-@ life period was about 10 times higher than the 2 @-@ hour half @-@ hour after sub@@ cut@@ aneous use in an earlier study ; this points to an extended retention of the medicine in the skin .
systemic exposure data showed that the absorption of i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine after topical application on MC @-@ dise@@ ased skin was low and comparable to that of healthy adults and adults with ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ ose or super@@ charged bas@@ al cell carcin@@ oma .
in a four @-@ month study of der@@ mal toxic@@ ity in rats , doses of 0.5 and 2.5 mg / kg CG resulted in significantly reduced body weight and increased sp@@ le@@ en weight ; a study carried out for four months for the der@@ mal application yiel@@ ded no similar effects in the mouse .
a two @-@ year study of carcin@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity in mice on three days a week did not indu@@ ce tumours on the application .
the appropriate mechanism is not known , but since I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine only possesses a low system absorption from the human skin and is not mut@@ agen@@ ic , a risk for humans is considered to be very low due to systemic exposure .
the tum@@ ors were in the group of mice treated with the active ingredient , earlier and in greater numbers than in the control group with low U@@ VR .

Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me is used for enz@@ ym@@ atic therapy in patients with confirmed diagnosis of a Mu@@ cop@@ oly@@ sac@@ chari@@ dosis I ( M@@ PS I ; α -@@ L @-@ I@@ dur@@ on@@ id@@ ase deficiency ) to treat the non @-@ neuro@@ logical manifestations of the disease ( the symptoms that are not related to brain or nerves ) .
this means that certain substances ( gly@@ cos@@ am@@ ino@@ gly@@ cans , g@@ ags ) are not min@@ ed and therefore accumulate in most organs in the body and damage them .
the following non neuro@@ logical symptoms of the M@@ PS I can occur : enlarged liver , stiff joints , complic@@ ating movements , reduced lung volume , heart and eye diseases .
the treatment with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should be monitored by a doctor who has experience in the treatment of patients with M@@ PS I or other inherited metabolic diseases .
the administration of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should take place in a hospital or clinic with re@@ vit@@ alizing devices , and patients may need appropriate medicines prior to administration to prevent allergic reaction .

the study mainly investig@@ ates the safety of the drug , but its effectiveness has also been measured ( by examining its effect on reducing G@@ AG concentrations in the urine and in relation to the size of the liver ) .
in children under the age of five , Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me lowered G@@ AG concentrations in the urine by about 60 % , and half of the treated children showed a normal large liver at the end of the study .
the most common side effects of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in patients at the age of over five years ( observed in more than 1 of 10 patients ) include headache , nausea , abdominal pain , rash , ar@@ th@@ rop@@ athy ( joint pain ) , back pain , pain in the limbs ( in hands and feet ) , heat feeling , fever and reactions at the in@@ fusion point .
very common side effects in patients under five years are elevated blood pressure , reduced oxygen satur@@ ation ( a measurement of lung function ) , t@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ dia ( accelerated heart rate ) , fever and ch@@ ills .
Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me may not be used in patients who possibly react strongly hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase or any of the other components ( an@@ ap@@ hy@@ lac@@ tic reaction ) .
the European Medic@@ ines Agency ( E@@ MEA ) will review every year any new information that may be known , and where necessary update this summary .
the manufacturer of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me will observe patients who receive al@@ thir@@ az@@ y@@ ms in response to the reactions to the in@@ fusion and the development of antibodies .
in June 2003 , the European Commission issued a permit to the company Gen@@ zy@@ me Europe B.@@ V. for the placing on the market of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me throughout the European Union .
Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase is a re@@ combin@@ ant form of human α @-@ L @-@ I@@ dur@@ on@@ id@@ ase and is produced using re@@ combin@@ ant DNA technology using CH@@ O mamm@@ ali@@ an cell cultures ( Chinese ham@@ ster O@@ vary , ov@@ ary of the Chinese ham@@ ster ) .
Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me is indicated for long @-@ term enzyme therapy in patients with a confirmed diagnosis of a Mu@@ cop@@ oly@@ sac@@ chari@@ dosis I ( M@@ PS I , α -@@ L @-@ I@@ dur@@ on@@ id@@ ase deficiency ) in order to treat the non @-@ neuro@@ logical manifestations of the disease ( see Section 5.1 ) .
treatment with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should be performed by a doctor who has experience in the treatment of patients with M@@ PS I or other inherited metabolic diseases .
the initial in@@ fusion rate of 2 E / kg / h can be increased every 15 minutes in individual steps to a maximum dose of 43 E / kg / h .
the safety and efficacy of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in adults over 65 years has not been determined , and no dosing schedule can be recommended for these patients .
the safety and efficacy of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in patients with kidney or liver in@@ suffici@@ ency has not been determined , and no dosing schedule can be recommended for these patients .
patients treated with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me can develop in@@ fusion @-@ related reactions defined as any side effect that occurs during in@@ fusion or until the end of the in@@ fusion ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) .
for this reason , especially these patients should continue to be closely monitored , and the in@@ fusion of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should only be carried out in an appropriate clinical environment in which re@@ vit@@ alizing facilities for medical emer@@ gen@@ cies are immediately available .
due to the clinical phase 3 study , nearly all patients with Ig@@ G antibodies against lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase are expected to develop normally within 3 months from the beginning of treatment .
patients who develop antibodies or symptoms of in@@ fusion @-@ related reactions must be treated with caution when using al@@ thir@@ az@@ y@@ ms ( see Sec@@ tions 4.3 and 4.@@ 8 ) .
since there is little experience regarding resum@@ ption of treatment after a longer break , the risk of hyper@@ sensitivity reactions must be cau@@ ti@@ ously performed after an interruption of the treatment .
60 minutes before the start of in@@ fusion with medication ( anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines and / or anti@@ py@@ re@@ tic ) to be treated in order to minimize the potential occurrence of in@@ fusion @-@ related reactions .
in the event of a mild or moderate in@@ fusion @-@ related reaction , the treatment with anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ini@@ ka and par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol / i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen should be considered and / or a reduction of the in@@ fusion rate to the half of the in@@ fusion rate in which the reaction occurred .
in case of a single serious in@@ fusion @-@ related reaction , the in@@ fusion needs to be stopped until the symptoms are reduced , a treatment with anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ini@@ ka and par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol / i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen is to be considered .
in@@ fusion can be resum@@ ed with a reduction of the in@@ fusion rate to 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of the in@@ fusion rate in which the reaction occurred .
3 are ( anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines and par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol / i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen and / or cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids ) as well as a reduction of the in@@ fusion rate to 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of the in@@ fusion rate in which the preceding reaction has occurred .
Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should not be used at the same time with chlor@@ o@@ qu@@ in or proc@@ ain because there is a potential risk of interference with in@@ trac@@ ell@@ ular in@@ trac@@ ell@@ ular absorption of lar@@ yn@@ id@@ ase .
animal experimental studies do not permit direct or indirect harmful effects on pregnancy , which include embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , birth and post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) .
since there are no data on new@@ bor@@ ns exposed to lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase over breast milk , it is recommended to not breast@@ feed during treatment with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me .
adverse events in clinical trials were mainly classified as in@@ fusion @-@ related reactions , which were observed in 53 % of patients in the Phase 3 study ( duration of treatment up to 4 years ) and 35 % of patients in the study with participants under 5 years ( duration of treatment up to 1 year ) .
adverse drug reactions in connection with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me observed during the phase 3 study and its extension in a total of 45 patients at the age of 5 years or older at a treatment period of up to 4 years are listed in the following table following the following frequency ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) ; often ( ≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10 ) .
in some patients with severe M@@ PS @-@ I @-@ conditioned involvement of the upper respiratory tract and lungs in the pre@@ history , severe reactions also occurred , including bron@@ ch@@ os@@ pas@@ m , respiratory failure and facial oil ( see section 4.4 ) .
children Un@@ wanted drug effects related to Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me , which were reported during a phase 2 study with a total of 20 patients aged under 5 , with predominantly severe transi@@ tioning form and treatment duration up to 12 months , are listed in the table .
100 E / kg intraven@@ ously once weekly ( recommended dose ) , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously once weekly , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks .
in most patients , a ser@@ o@@ con@@ version occurred within 3 months after the beginning of the treatment , with a more severe form of de@@ formation usually within one month ( average after 26 days compared to 45 days in patients at the age of 5 years and over ) .
until the end of the phase 3 study ( or up to a premature ej@@ ection from the study ) , 13 / 45 patients were unable to produce det@@ ectable antibodies by radio@@ immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression ( R@@ IP ) , among them 3 patients who never came to Ser@@ o@@ kon@@ ose .
patients with a lack of low antibody levels showed a robust reduction in the G@@ AG mirror in urine , while in patients with high antibody ti@@ ters a variable reduction of G@@ AG was detected in urine .
four patients ( three in phase 3 study and one in phase 2 study ) showed a marginal to low neutr@@ alizing inhibit@@ ory effect on enz@@ ym@@ atic lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase activity in vitro that did not imp@@ air clinical efficacy and / or reduction of G@@ AG in urine .
the presence of antibodies did not appear to be associated with the incidence of adverse drug reactions , even though the incidence of adverse drug reactions typically coinci@@ ded with the formation of Ig@@ G antibodies .
the reason for enz@@ ym@@ atic therapy is one of the hydro@@ ly@@ sis of the accumulated sub@@ str@@ at and the prevention of further accumulation of sufficient restoration of enzyme activity .
after intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion , Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase is quickly removed from the circulation and absorbed by cells into the Ly@@ s@@ os@@ omes , most likely with man@@ ose @-@ 6 phosph@@ ate recept@@ ors .
the safety and efficacy of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me were studied in a random@@ ized , double @-@ blind , placebo @-@ controlled Phase 3 study involving 45 patients aged 6 to 43 .
although patients were recru@@ ited for the study , which showed the entire spectrum of their disease , the majority of patients had the mean phen@@ otype and only one patient had the severe phen@@ otype .
patients were recru@@ ited if they had an accelerated exp@@ ir@@ atory volume ( Fe@@ V ) of less than 80 % of the expected value , and they had to be able to stand 6 minutes and walk 5 meters .
the primary end@@ points for the efficacy were the percentage change of the expected Fe@@ V and the absolute distance in the 6 @-@ minute walk .
all patients were subsequently recru@@ ited for an open label extension study , where they received 100 E / kg of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me for another 3.5 years ( 182 weeks ) each week .
after 26 weeks of therapy , patients treated with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me showed an improvement in lung function and sal@@ vi@@ ability compared to placebo in the following table .
the open extension study showed an improvement and / or maintenance of these effects of up to 20@@ 8 weeks in the Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me / Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me group and 182 weeks in the placebo / Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me group , as shown in the following table .
the decrease in the expected percentage of Fe@@ V is clin@@ ically not clin@@ ically significant over this period and the absolute lung volumes increased further proportion@@ ately to the body size of growing children .
of the 26 patients with a H@@ ep@@ atom@@ eg@@ aly before treatment , 22 ( 85 % ) reached a normal liver size by the end of the trial .
within the first 4 weeks a clear waste from the G@@ AG @-@ Spiegel was found in the urine ( µ@@ g / mg of Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in ) , which remained constant until the end of the study .
with regard to the hetero@@ geneous disease manifestation between patients taking into account clin@@ ically significant changes across five efficacy @-@ variables ( expected percentage of normal fe@@ V , distance in the 6 @-@ minute walk , range of movement of the shoulder joint A@@ HI and visual acuity ) , there was generally an improvement in 26 patients ( 58 % ) , no change in 10 patients ( 22 % ) and a wor@@ sen@@ ing in 9 patients ( 20 % ) .
a one @-@ year open phase 2 trial was conducted where the safety and pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me were investigated in 20 patients at the time of their inclusion in the study under 5 years ( 16 patients with severe form and 4 with the mean follow @-@ up ) .
in four patients the dosage was increased to 200 E / kg due to increased G@@ ag@@ - Mir@@ ror in urine in week 22 .
in several patients , a growth rate ( n = 7 ) and a weight gain ( n = 3 ) were determined by the Z @-@ S@@ core for this age group . the younger patients with a severe disease form ( &lt; 2.5 years ) and all 4 patients with the middle course form showed a normal mental development speed , whereas in older patients with severe transi@@ tioning only limited or even no progress in cognitive development was observed .
in a phase 4 study , studies on pharmac@@ o@@ co@@ dynamic effects of different Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me dosage schemes were performed on the G@@ AG @-@ Spiegel in the urine , the liver volume and the 6 @-@ minute walk test .
100 E / kg intraven@@ ously once weekly ( recommended dose ) , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously once weekly , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks .
the dosage schedule with 200 E / kg intraven@@ ous every 2 weeks can represent a reasonable alternative in patients who have difficulties with weekly in@@ fu@@ sions ; however , it is not proven that the long @-@ term clinical effectiveness of these two dosage schemes is equivalent .
the European Medic@@ ines Agency ( E@@ MEA ) will evaluate any new information available annually , and if necessary , the summary of the features of the drug will be updated .
the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic profile of patients at the age of 5 years was similar to that of elderly and less severely affected patients .
based on conventional studies on safety har@@ mac@@ ology , toxic@@ ity with a unique gift , toxic@@ ity in repeated administration and reproductive toxic@@ ity , prec@@ lin@@ ical data can not detect any particular dangers to humans .
since no compatibility studies have been carried out , this drug may not be mixed with other medicines except those listed under 6 .

A@@ lim@@ ta is used together with C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin ( another medicine against cancer ) in patients who have not received chemotherapy ( medicine against cancer ) and &quot; mal@@ ig@@ ne &quot; ( malign@@ ant - cancer has already spread to other parts of the body ) and is likely to spread easily on other parts of the body .
A@@ lim@@ ta is used in patients who have not been treated before , in combination with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin and in patients who have previously received other chem@@ o@@ therapies as sole therapy .
to reduce side effects , the patients should take a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oid as well as fo@@ lic acid ( a vitamin ) during treatment with A@@ lim@@ TA and receive inj@@ ections of vitamin B@@ 12 .
if A@@ lim@@ ta is administered together with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin , an anti @-@ em@@ etic drug should be given before or after the administration of c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin ( medicines for vom@@ iting ) and liquids ( to prevent a lack of fluids ) .
in patients whose blood pattern changes or where certain other side effects occur , the treatment should be postpon@@ ed , de@@ posed or the dose should be reduced .
the active form of p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed thus slow@@ s the formation of DNA and RNA and prevents the cells from sharing .
the conversion of p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed into its active form is more readily available in cancer cells than in healthy cells , leading to higher concentrations of the active form of the drug and a longer period of time in cancer cells .
for the treatment of the malign@@ ant ple@@ ural epitheli@@ um , A@@ lim@@ ta was examined in a main study of 4@@ 56 patients who had previously not received chemotherapy against their disease .
in the treatment of non @-@ small cell lung cancer , the effects of A@@ lim@@ ta were compared to 5@@ 71 patients with locally advanced or metastatic disease previously treated with chemotherapy , with the effects of doc@@ et@@ ax@@ el ( another drug against cancer ) .
A@@ lim@@ ta was also compared to gem@@ cit@@ abine ( another cancer drug ) , both in combination with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin in 1 7@@ 25 patients who had previously not received chemotherapy for lung cancer .
patients treated with A@@ lim@@ ta and C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin lived an average of 12.@@ 1 months , compared to 9.@@ 3 months in the sole administration of c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin .
in patients who had previously received chemotherapy , the mean survival time with A@@ lim@@ TA was 8.@@ 3 months , compared with 7.@@ 9 months in doc@@ et@@ ax@@ el .
in both studies , however , patients in which the cancer did not attack the squ@@ am@@ ous cell cells reported longer survival times in the administration of A@@ lim@@ TA than with the comparison medication .
in September 2004 , the European Commission issued a permit to the company Eli Lil@@ ly Ne@@ der@@ land B.@@ V. for the placing on the market of A@@ lim@@ ta across the European Union .
each water bottle has to be dissolved with 4.@@ 2 ml 0.@@ 9 % sodium chlori@@ de injection solution ( 9 mg / ml ) , resulting in a solution of 25 mg / ml .
the corresponding volume of the necessary dose is taken from the water bottle and dil@@ uted with 0.@@ 9 % sodium chlori@@ de injection solution ( 9 mg / ml ) to 100 ml ( see section 6.@@ 6 ) .
A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA is indicated in combination with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin for first @-@ line treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic non @-@ small cell bron@@ chi@@ al carcin@@ oma ( see section 5.1 ) .
A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA in mon@@ otherapy is indicated for the treatment in second @-@ line treatment of patients with loc@@ - , advanced or metastatic non @-@ small cell bron@@ chi@@ al carcin@@ oma ( see Section 5.1 ) .
the recommended dose of A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA 500 mg / m ² body surface area ( KO@@ F ) is administered as intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion for a period of 10 minutes on the first day of every 21 day treatment cycle .
the recommended dose of c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin is 75 mg / m ² KO@@ F as in@@ fusion for a period of 2 hours approximately 30 minutes after completion of the p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ x@@ ed@@ - in@@ fusion on the first day every 21 day treatment cycle .
in patients with non @-@ small cell lung cancer following previous chemotherapy , the recommended dose of A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA 500 mg / m ² KO@@ F is administered as intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion for a period of 10 minutes on the first day of every 21 day treatment cycle .
to reduce the frequency and sever@@ ity of skin reactions , a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oid must be given on the day before and on the day of the p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed dosage and on the day after the treatment .
during the seven days before the first dose of p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed , at least 5 doses of fo@@ lic acid must be taken and the dose should be continued throughout the therapy period and for another 21 days after the last dose of p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ x@@ ed@@ - dosage .
patients must also receive an intra@@ muscular injection of vitamin B@@ 12 ( 1000 micro@@ grams ) in the week before the first mixed dose and after each third treatment cycle .
in patients who receive p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed , a complete blood @-@ image should be created before each gift , including a differentiation of the leu@@ ko@@ cytes and a th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ te counting .
the alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase ( AP ) , as@@ part@@ ate trans@@ amin@@ ase ( AST or S@@ GO@@ T ) and Alan@@ ine trans@@ amin@@ ase ( AL@@ T or S@@ GP@@ T ) should be ≤ 3 times the upper limit value .
at the beginning of a new treatment cycle , a dose check has to take place considering the N@@ adi@@ r of the blood image or the maximum non @-@ hem@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity of the previous therapy cycles .
after recovery , patients must be treated in accordance with the indications in the tables 1 , 2 and 3 , which are to be used for A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA as mon@@ otherapy or in combination with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin .
these criteria correspond to the definition of the National Cancer Institute Common Tox@@ ic@@ ity C@@ riteri@@ a ( C@@ TC v@@ 2.0 ; N@@ CI 1998 ) ≥ C@@ TC de@@ grade 2 bleeding .
should patients not develop ha@@ em@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity ≥ degree 3 ( except neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity ) , the therapy must be interrupted with A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA until the patient has the value prior to treatment
treatment with A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA must be stopped when in patients after 2 dos@@ ages a ha@@ em@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity or non @-@ hem@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity degree 3 or 4 occurs or so@@ - proceeds on the occurrence of Grade 3 or 4 neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity .
clinical studies showed no indication that there is an increased risk of side effects in patients aged 65 years or older than 65 years of age .
A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA is not recommended for use in children under 18 years of age due to insufficient data on safety and efficacy .
in clinical trials , dose adap@@ tations for patients with a cre@@ atine clearance of ≥ 45 ml / min were not necessary , which go beyond the dose adaptation recommended for all patients .
the data situation in patients with a cre@@ atine clearance of less than 45 ml / min was not sufficient ; therefore the application is not recommended ( see section 4.4 ) .
however , patients with a liver function restriction of &gt; 1.5 @-@ fold of the upper B@@ ili@@ ru@@ bin@@ s- boundary value and / or trans@@ amin@@ ase values of &gt; 5.0 @-@ fold the upper limit value ( in the presence of liver metast@@ ases ) were not studied especially in the studies .
patients must be monitored with regard to bone mar@@ ital immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression and p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed should not be given to patients before their absolute neutr@@ ino number has again reached a value of ≥ 1,500 cells / mm ³ and the th@@ rom@@ bo@@ - cy@@ te @-@ count again a value of ≥ 100,000 cells / mm ³ .
a dose reduction for further cycles is based on the N@@ adi@@ r of absolute neut@@ ro@@ ph@@ ils , th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ te numbers and maximum non @-@ hem@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity as observed in previous treatment cycles ( see section 4.2 ) .
a lower toxic@@ ity and a reduction of grade 3 / 4 hem@@ at@@ ological and ni@@ th@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity such as neut@@ rop@@ en@@ ia , f@@ eb@@ ri@@ le neut@@ rop@@ en@@ ia and infection with grade 3 / 4 neut@@ rop@@ en@@ ia has been studi@@ o- or dis@@ regarded as a pre@@ treatment with fo@@ lic acid and vitamin B@@ 12 had taken place .
therefore , all patients treated with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed must be advised to use fo@@ lic acid and vitamin B@@ 12 as a pro@@ phy@@ lac@@ tic measure to reduce treatment @-@ related toxic@@ ity ( see section 4.2 ) .
patients with mild to moderate ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency ( Cre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance 45 to 79 ml / min ) must avoid simultaneous use of non@@ ster@@ oid@@ al anti@@ ph@@ log@@ isti@@ ca ( N@@ SA@@ IDs ) such as i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen and acet@@ yl@@ sali@@ vary ( &gt; 1,3 g daily ) for at least 2 days prior to therapy , on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after therapy with p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed ( see Section 4.5 ) .
all patients with p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed therapy must avoid taking N@@ SA@@ IDs with long half @-@ life for at least 5 days prior to the therapy , on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after therapy with p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed ( see Section 4.5 ) .
many patients in which these events occurred had corresponding risk factors for the occurrence of ren@@ al events , including de@@ hydr@@ ation , pre @-@ existing high blood pressure or diabetes .
therefore , a drainage of the eff@@ usion before the p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed treatment should be considered in patients with clin@@ ically significant fluid retention in the trans@@ form@@ er@@ ell@@ ular space .
5 major cardiovascular events , including m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction , and cereb@@ rov@@ ascular events were occasionally reported in clinical studies with p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed , if this substance was usually given in combination with another cy@@ tot@@ ox@@ ic agent .
for this reason , the simultaneous use of atten@@ u@@ ated live vaccine ( except yellow fever , this vacc@@ ination is contra@@ indicated ) is not recommended ( see Section 4.3 and 4.5 ) .
since the possibility of an ir@@ reversible damage to reproductive ability by p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed , men should be advised prior to the treatment in order to obtain advice on the preservation of sperm .
in patients with normal ren@@ al function ( cre@@ atine clearance ≥ 80 ml / min ) high doses of non@@ ster@@ oid@@ al anti@@ ph@@ log@@ isti@@ ca ( N@@ SA@@ IDs , such as i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen &gt; 1600 mg / day ) and acet@@ yl@@ sal@@ ic@@ y@@ lic acid in high dos@@ ages ( ≥ 1.3 g daily ) can result in a reduced P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed ex@@ cre@@ tion with the consequence of increased occurrence of side effects .
it is therefore advisable to use high doses of N@@ SA@@ IDs or as@@ ce@@ - t@@ yl@@ sal@@ ic@@ y@@ lic acid in high doses if patients with normal ren@@ al function ( cre@@ atine clearance ≥ 80 ml / min ) are recommended .
i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen ) or acet@@ yl@@ sal@@ ic@@ y@@ lic acid in high dosage for at least 2 days prior to therapy , be avoided on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after therapy with p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed ( see section 4.4 ) .
since there is no data regarding the interaction potential with N@@ SA@@ IDs , with long half @-@ life such as Pi@@ ro@@ - x@@ ic@@ am or R@@ of@@ ec@@ oxi@@ b , the simultaneous use of p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed must be avoided at least 5 days prior to the therapy , on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after therapy with p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ - xed .
the large in@@ tra @-@ individual vari@@ ability of co@@ ag@@ ulation status during the disease and the possibility of interactions between oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants and ant@@ ine@@ oplas@@ tic chemotherapy requires an increased monitoring frequency of IN@@ R ( International Norm@@ alized R@@ atio ) if the decision was made to treat the patient with oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants .
there are no data for the use of p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed in pregnant women , but as with decent an@@ tim@@ etab@@ ol@@ ites , severe birth defects are expected in pregnancy .
p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed should not be used during pregnancy , except if it is essential and after careful consideration of the benefits for the mother and the risk of fet@@ us ( see section 4.4 ) .
since the possibility of an ir@@ reversible damage to reproductive ability by p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed , men should be advised prior to the beginning of treatment to obtain advice regarding the sperm count .
it is not known whether p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed is passed into the breast milk and unwanted effects on breast@@ feeding inf@@ ant cannot be ruled out .
the following table shows the frequency and sever@@ ity of adverse events reported in &gt; 5 % of 168 patients with mes@@ o@@ theli@@ oma and the random@@ ized c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin and p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed - as well as 16@@ 3 patients with mes@@ o@@ theli@@ oma , which random@@ ized c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin received as mon@@ otherapy .

clin@@ ically relevant C@@ TC toxic@@ ity reported in &lt; 1 % ( occasionally ) of patients receiving random@@ ized p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed included sup@@ rav@@ entri@@ cular ar@@ rhyth@@ mi@@ as .
clin@@ ically relevant laboratory toxic@@ ity grade 3 and 4 was similar to phase 2 combined with three individual p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed mono therapy studies ( n = 164 ) , excluding neut@@ rop@@ en@@ ia ( 12.@@ 8 % compared to 5.3 % ) and an increase in al@@ anine trans@@ amin@@ ase ( 15.@@ 2 % compared to 1.9 % ) .
these differences are likely to be traced back to differences in the patient population because the pha@@ sis 2 studies included both chem@@ on@@ ai@@ ve and significantly pre @-@ treated breast cancer patients with existing liver metast@@ ases and / or abnormal initial values of liver function tests .
the following table shows the frequency and sever@@ ity of adverse events that could be possible in connection with the study medication ; they were reported in &gt; 5 % of 8@@ 39 patients with NSC@@ LC who received random@@ ised c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin and p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed and 8@@ 30 patients with NSC@@ LC who were random@@ ised to receive C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin and gem@@ cit@@ abine .

clin@@ ically relevant toxic@@ ity reported ≥ 1 % and ≤ 5 % ( common ) of patients receiving random@@ ized c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin and p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed were :
clin@@ ically relevant toxic@@ ity reported in &lt; 1 % ( occasionally ) of patients who received ran@@ - dom@@ ici@@ zed c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin and p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed were included :
serious cardiovascular and cereb@@ rov@@ ascular events including m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction , ang@@ ina pec@@ tor@@ is , cereb@@ rov@@ ascular insul@@ t and trans@@ it@@ ory isch@@ em@@ ic attacks were occasionally reported in clinical studies with p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed , which is usually administered in combination with another cy@@ tot@@ ox@@ ic agent .
patients with p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed treatment occasionally reported cases of co@@ li@@ - tis ( including intestinal and rec@@ tal bleeding , sometimes fatal intestinal per@@ fo@@ - ration , intestinal nec@@ ro@@ sis and ty@@ ph@@ ony ) .
in patients with p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed @-@ treatment , occasional cases of sometimes fatal inter@@ sti@@ tial pneum@@ oni@@ tis with respiratory failure were reported in patients with mixed @-@ mixed treatment .
cases of acute ren@@ al failure in p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed mon@@ otherapy or in combination with other chem@@ o@@ therapeu@@ tics have been reported ( see section 4.4 ) .
cases of radiation pneum@@ oni@@ tis were reported in patients before , during or after their p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed therapy ( see section 4.4 ) .
A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA ( P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed ) is an ant@@ ine@@ oplas@@ tic anti @-@ fol@@ ate which exercises its effect by breaking sandwich @-@ dependent metabolic processes necessary for cell rep@@ lication .
in vitro studies showed that p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed acts as an anti @-@ fol@@ ate with multiple targets by blocking the thy@@ mi@@ dy@@ l@@ atin syn@@ th@@ ase ( TS ) , D@@ ih@@ y@@ dro@@ logical reduc@@ t@@ ase ( DH@@ FR ) and Gly@@ cin@@ am@@ i@@ dri@@ bon@@ u@@ cle@@ oti@@ d@@ for@@ - m@@ yl@@ transfer@@ ase ( G@@ AR@@ FT ) , which are key @-@ dependent key enzymes of the de nov@@ o bi@@ osyn@@ thesis of thy@@ mid@@ - and pur@@ inn@@ u@@ cle@@ oti@@ des .
E@@ MP@@ H@@ AC@@ IS , a multi@@ center , random@@ ized , single @-@ blind phase 3 study of A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA plus c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin against c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin in chem@@ on@@ ai@@ ve patients with malign@@ ant ple@@ ural mes@@ o@@ theli@@ oma showed that patients treated with A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA and C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin had a clin@@ ically significant advantage of survival compared to those patients who were only treated with C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin .
primary analysis of this study was carried out in the population of all patients receiving test medication in the treatment arm ( random@@ ised and treated ) .
a statisti@@ cally significant improvement in the clin@@ ically relevant symptoms ( pain and dy@@ sp@@ nea ) in connection with malign@@ ant ple@@ ur@@ am@@ es@@ o@@ theli@@ oma was shown in the A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA / C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin arm ( 212 patients ) compared to the sole c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin arm ( 2@@ 18 patients ) .
the differences between the two treatment arms resulted in improved lung function parameters in the A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA / C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin arm and a worse of lung function over time in the control arm .
a multi @-@ centre , random@@ ised , open phase III study with A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA in patients with locally advanced or metastatic NSC@@ LC showed medi@@ an survival of 8.@@ 3 months in patients treated with A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA ( Int@@ ent to treat population n = 28@@ 3 ) and 7.@@ 9 months in patients treated with doc@@ et@@ ax@@ el ( IT@@ T n = 28@@ 8 ) .
an analysis of the influence of hist@@ ology on the treatment effect on overall survival fell in favour of A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA in patients with NSC@@ LC with a predominantly non @-@ plate epitheli@@ al hist@@ ological type ( n = 0.@@ 78 ; 95 % CI = 0.@@ 61 @-@ 1.@@ 00 , p = 0.0@@ 47 ; 95 % CI = 1.@@ 08 @-@ 2,@@ 26 , p = 0.0@@ 18 ) .
limited data of a controlled , controlled Phase 3 study show that efficacy data ( survival and progression @-@ free survival ) for p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed between patients with ( n = 41 ) and without ( n = 540 ) pre@@ treatment by doc@@ et@@ ax@@ el are similar .
the efficacy analyses of the P@@ Q population are consistent with the analyses of the IT@@ T population and support the non @-@ su@@ prem@@ acy of the A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin Com@@ bin@@ ation compared to gem@@ cit@@ abine C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin .
mean PFS was 4.@@ 8 months for combination of gem@@ cit@@ abine C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin versus 5.1 months for combination gem@@ cit@@ abine c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin ( adjusted HR = 1.@@ 04 ; 95 % CI = 0.@@ 94 - 1.@@ 15 ) , the overall response rate was 28.@@ 2 % ( 95 % CI = 25.@@ 0 - 3@@ 1,4 ) for combination gem@@ cit@@ abine c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin .
the analysis of the impact of NSC@@ LC on survival showed clin@@ ically relevant differences according to hist@@ ology , see table below .
CI = confidence interval ; IT@@ T = intent @-@ to @-@ treat ; N = magnitude of the overall population a statisti@@ cally significant for non @-@ su@@ prem@@ acy , with a total nominal frequency for HR ( = Haz@@ ard ratio ) clearly below the non @-@ inferior limit of 1.@@ 17@@ 6@@ 45 ( p &lt; 0,@@ 001 ) .
patients treated with A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA and c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin needed less trans@@ fu@@ sions ( 16.@@ 4 % versus 28.@@ 9 % , p &lt; 0.@@ 001 ) , er@@ y@@ thro@@ cy@@ te trans@@ fu@@ sions ( 16.@@ 1 % versus 27.@@ 3 % , p &lt; 0,@@ 001 ) and th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ te trans@@ fu@@ sions ( 1.8 % versus 4.5 % , p = 0.00@@ 2 ) .
in addition , the patients sel@@ - ten@@ er the administration of er@@ y@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin / dar@@ b@@ opo@@ ie@@ tin ( 10.@@ 4 % versus 18.@@ 1 % , p &lt; 0,@@ 001 ) , G @-@ CS@@ F / GM @-@ CS@@ F ( 3.1 % versus 6.1 % , p = 0.00@@ 4 ) , and iron preparations ( 4.3 % versus 7.@@ 0 % , p = 0.0@@ 21 ) .
in 4@@ 26 cancer patients with various solid tumours in doses ranging from 0.2 to 8@@ 38 mg / m ² in in@@ fusion zones , pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic properties of p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed as a single therapeutic agent were examined in in@@ fusion zones for a period of 10 minutes .
p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed is mainly ex@@ cre@@ ted in the urine and 70 % to 90 % of the administered dose is found in the urine continuously within 24 hours of the application .

dissolve the contents of 100 mg of 100 mg of sodium chlori@@ de injection solution ( 9 mg / ml ) with no preservatives , which results in a solution with a concentrate of about 25 mg / ml of p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed .
dissolve the contents of 500 mg / ml of sodium chlori@@ de injection solution ( 9 mg / ml ) with no preservatives , which results in a solution with a concentrate of about 25 mg / ml of p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed .
the resulting solution is clear and the coloring ranges from color@@ less to yellow or green@@ ish yellow , without compromising the quality of the product .
it is used for overweight adults with a body mass index ( BM@@ I ) ≥ 28 kg per square meter combined with low @-@ cal@@ orie , fat @-@ reduced nutrition .
patients who are taking All@@ i and who are not able to lose weight after 12 weeks should contact their doctor or pharmac@@ ist .
if these enzymes are in@@ hibited , they cannot metabol@@ ise some fats in the food , which causes about a quarter of the fats attributed to food un@@ di@@ gest@@ ed the intest@@ ines .
in a third study , All@@ i was compared to 3@@ 91 overweight patients with a BM@@ I between 25 and 28 kg / m2 with placebo .
in both studies , patients with BM@@ I ≥ 28 kg / m2 had an average weight loss of 4.@@ 8 kg after one year , compared to 2.3 kg when taking placebo .
in the study with All@@ i in patients with a BM@@ I between 25 and 28 kg / m2 no weight loss could be observed for patients .
the most common side effects of All@@ i ( observed in more than 1 of 10 patients ) are o@@ ily spots on anus , fl@@ atus ( winds ) with stu@@ cco duct , chair pull , o@@ ily / o@@ ily chair , finish o@@ ily sections ( rot@@ ting ) , flat@@ ul@@ ence ( winds ) and soft chairs .
it should not be used in patients who are treated with C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( to prevent organ rejection in transplan@@ ts ) or with medicines such as war@@ far@@ in to prevent blood cl@@ ots .
it must also not be used in patients suffering from long @-@ term mal@@ absorption syndrome ( where not enough nutrients are absorbed from the digestive tract ) or ch@@ ol@@ est@@ ase ( liver disease ) , and in pregnant women or in breast @-@ feeding mothers .
in July 2007 , the European Commission issued a permit to Gla@@ xo Group Limited for placing or@@ list@@ at GS@@ K in the entire European Union .
all@@ i is indicated for weight reduction of adults with overweight ( Body @-@ Mass @-@ Index BM@@ I ≥ 28 kg / m2 ) and should be applied in conjunction with a slightly hypo@@ kal@@ oric , low @-@ fat diet .
all@@ i must not be used by children and adolescents under the age of 18 , as there are insufficient data on efficacy and safety .
as or@@ list@@ at is only moder@@ ately res@@ or@@ bed , elderly people and patients with reduced liver and / or kidney function do not require adjusting the dosage .
hyper@@ sensitivity to the active ingredient or any of the other ingredients • Simul@@ tane@@ ous treatment with C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( see Section 4.6 ) • Sti@@ ll time ( see section 4.6 ) • Sti@@ ll time ( see Section 4.6 ) • Simul@@ tane@@ ous treatment with war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants ( see Sec@@ tions 4.5 and 4.@@ 8 )
the lik@@ el@@ ihood of occurrence of gastro@@ intestinal symptoms ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) may increase if all@@ i is taken together with a fat @-@ rich single meal or fat @-@ rich diet .
as weight reduction in diabetes can be associated with improved metabolic monitoring , patients who take a medicine against diabetes should consult a doctor or pharmac@@ ist before starting a therapy with all@@ i , because the dosage of anti@@ diabe@@ tic medicine needs to be adjusted .
patients who use all@@ i as well as medicines for high blood pressure or increased cholesterol should consult their doctor or pharmac@@ ist if the dosage needs to be adapted .
it is recommended to take additional fluctu@@ ating measures in order to prevent the possible failure of oral contrac@@ eption in case of severe diar@@ rho@@ ea ( see Section 4.5 ) .
both in a study on the interactions of drugs and in several cases with simultaneous use of or@@ list@@ at and C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in a lowering of the C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in plasma was observed .
in the application of war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants in combination with or@@ list@@ at the Quick values ( international normal ratio , IN@@ R ) could be influenced ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) .
in most patients who have been treated with or@@ list@@ at in clinical trials up to 4 full years , the concentrations of vitamins A , D , E and K as well as the beta carot@@ ene remain in the normal range .
however , the patient should be advised to take a supplementary mul@@ tiv@@ it@@ amin supplement before bed@@ time to ensure sufficient vitamin intake ( see section 4.4 ) .
after the addition of a single dose of A@@ mi@@ o@@ dar@@ one a minor decrease of the A@@ mi@@ o@@ dar@@ one plasma concentration was observed with a limited number of healthy volunteers who received or@@ list@@ at at the same time .
animal experimental studies showed no direct or indirect effects on pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , birth or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) .
the side effects of or@@ list@@ at are mainly gastro@@ intestinal nature and are related to the pharmac@@ ological effect of the drug , as the absorption of captured fat is prevented .
the gastro@@ intestinal side effects were determined from clinical studies with or@@ list@@ at 60 mg over a period of 18 months to 2 years and were generally mild and temporary .
the frequency is defined as follows : very often ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) , occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) , rarely ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 , &lt; 1 / 1000 ) and very rare ( &lt; 1 / 10 ) , not known ( frequency based on available data cannot be estimated ) .
the frequency of the reported side effects reported after the market launch of or@@ list@@ at is not known as these events were voluntarily reported by a population of uncertain magnitude .
† It is plau@@ sible that treatment with all@@ i may lead to anxiety regarding possible or actual gastro@@ intestinal side effects .
single doses of 800 mg or@@ list@@ at and multiple doses of up to 400 mg three times a day were administered over a period of 15 days in normal and obes@@ e subjects without significant clinical findings .
in the majority of cases of or@@ list@@ at over@@ dose reported after the market launch , no side effects or similar side effects were reported as reported at the recommended dose of or@@ list@@ at .
based on human and animal studies , a rapid recovery of any systemic effects caused by the lip@@ id properties of or@@ list@@ at can be assumed .
the therapeutic effect is applied in the l@@ umen of the stomach and the upper small intest@@ ine through co@@ valent bonding to the active ser@@ ine @-@ rest of ga@@ stri@@ c and ank@@ re@@ ous li@@ pas@@ s .
from clinical studies it was derived that 60 mg or@@ list@@ at , taken three times a day , blocked the absorption of about 25 % of the food fat .
two double @-@ blind , random@@ ised , placebo @-@ controlled trials in adults with a BM@@ I ≥ 28 kg / m2 substanti@@ ate the efficacy of 60 mg or@@ list@@ at , which was taken three times a day in combination with a hypo@@ kal@@ oric , fet@@ al diet .
the primary parameter that changes the body weight compared to the initial value ( at the time of random@@ isation ) was assessed as follows : as a change in body weight in the course of study ( table 1 ) and as a percentage of those participating in the study , which have lost more than 5 % or more than 10 % of their initial weight ( Table 2 ) .
although the weight reduction was observed over 12 months in both studies , the greatest weight loss occurred in the first 6 months .
the average cholesterol in the total cholesterol was 60 mg -@@ 2.4 % with or@@ list@@ at ( initial value 5,@@ 20 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and with placebo + 2.8 % ( initial value 5,@@ 26 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
the average change in L@@ DL cholesterol was with or@@ list@@ at 60 mg -@@ 3,5 % ( initial value 3,@@ 30 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and with placebo + 3.8 % ( initial value 3,@@ 41 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
at the waist circum@@ ference , the average change was -@@ 4.5 cm with or@@ list@@ at 60 mg ( initial value 10@@ 3.@@ 7 cm ) and with placebo -@@ 3.6 cm ( initial value 10@@ 3.5 cm ) .
plasma concentrations of non @-@ met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed or@@ list@@ at were not meas@@ urable 8 hours after the oral administration of 360 mg or@@ list@@ at ( &lt; 5 ng / ml ) .
7 In general , not met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed or@@ list@@ at in plasma could be detected spor@@ adi@@ cally and at extremely low concentrations ( &lt; 10 ng / ml or 0.@@ 02 µ@@ mo@@ l ) and without signs of cum@@ ulation .
in a study with obes@@ e patients who administered the minimal systemic res@@ or@@ bi@@ ated dose , two main metabol@@ ites , namely M1 ( in position 4 hydro@@ ly@@ sed Lac@@ ton@@ ring ) and M3 ( M1 after spl@@ itting the N @-@ formed leu@@ c@@ ine group ) , were identified , which represented approximately 42 % of total plasma concentration .
based on conventional studies on safety har@@ mac@@ ology , toxic@@ ity in repeated application , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity , carcin@@ ogen@@ ic potential and reproductive toxic@@ ity , prec@@ lin@@ ical data do not reveal any particular danger to humans .

with the following basic rules you can learn to minimize the nutritional benefits : • Start some days , or better a week before taking capsules with a fet@@ al diet . • Learn more about the usual fat content of your favorite foods and about the size of portions you normally take .
if you know exactly how much you eat , the lik@@ el@@ ihood that you exceed your fat limit will decrease . • Share your recommended amount of fat evenly on daily meals .
save the amount of calories and fat that you are allowed to take per meal , not to take them in the form of a fat @-@ rich main dish or a substantial night@@ stand , as you may have done with other programs for weight reduction . • Most people with those accompanying symptoms learn to control them with time by adjusting their diet .
• Do not store the medicine for children . • Do not use any more than 25 ° C after the exp@@ iry date stated on the box . • Do not store the container tightly to protect the contents from moisture . • The bottle contains two white sealed containers with si@@ lica gel that serve to keep the capsules dry .
swal@@ low it in no way . • You can take your daily dose al@@ i in the blue transport box ( shuttle ) with it included in this pack .

obesity has an effect on your health and increases the risk of developing various serious diseases such as : • hypertension • diabetes • Heart disease • stroke • Cer@@ tain cancers • Oste@@ o@@ arthritis Spe@@ ak to your doctor about your risk for these diseases .
lasting weight loss , for example by improving nutrition and more exercise , can prevent the emergence of serious diseases and has a positive impact on your health .
choose meals that include a wide range of nutrients , and gradually learn to eat heal@@ th@@ ily .
energy is also measured in kilo@@ j@@ ou@@ les , which you can also find as an indication of the food packaging . • The recommended cal@@ orie intake indicates how many calories you should take maximum per day .
keep in mind the tables below in this section . • The recommended fat intake in grams is the maximum amount of fat that you should take with each meal .
the amount of calories suitable for you can be found in the information below indicating the number of calories suitable for you . • D@@ ue to the capsule &apos;s mode of action , adher@@ ence to the recommended fat intake is crucial .
if you take the same amount of fat as before , this can mean that your body cannot process this amount of fat .
by adher@@ ing to the recommended fat intake , you can maxim@@ ise weight loss and at the same time reduce the lik@@ el@@ ihood of diet @-@ related companion appearances . • You should try to gradually lose weight .
34 This reduced cal@@ orie intake should allow you to gradually and continuously lose about 0.5 kg per week in weight without developing fru@@ stration and dis@@ appointments .
the more active you are , the higher your recommended cal@@ orie intake . • &quot; Low physical activity &quot; means that you do not walk daily , climb stairs , work in the garden or perform other physical activities . • &quot; Medium physical activity &quot; means that you burn 150 k@@ cal daily by exercise , e.g. by 3 km walking , 30 to 45 minutes of gardening or 2 km running in 15 minutes .
• For a lasting weight loss , it is necessary to set realistic cal@@ orie and fat targets and adhere to them . • A nutritional diary with information about the cal@@ orie and fat content of your meals . • T@@ ry to move more before you start taking all@@ i .
the all@@ i program to support weight loss combines the capsules with a nutritional plan and a large number of other information materials that can help you eat cal@@ orie and fat @-@ based foods and give guidelines to become more physically active .
in conjunction with a weight loss program tailored to your type , this information helps you to develop a healthier lifestyle and achieve your target weight .
Alo@@ xi is used in chemotherapy , the strong trigger for nausea and vom@@ iting ( such as c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin ) , as well as in chem@@ o@@ therapies , which are the moderate trigger for nausea and vom@@ iting ( such as cyclo@@ phosph@@ amide , do@@ x@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ in or carb@@ op@@ l@@ atin ) .
the efficacy of Alo@@ xi can be increased by adding a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids ( a medicine used as an anti @-@ em@@ etic drug ) .
the use in patients under 18 years of age is not recommended , because there is not enough information on the effects of this age group .
this means that the active ingredient inhi@@ bits the binding of a chemical substance in the body , 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amin ( 5@@ HT , also known as ser@@ oton@@ in ) to the recept@@ ors in the intest@@ ine .
in three main studies , Alo@@ xi was studied at 1 8@@ 42 adults who received chemotherapy , which are strong respectively moderate causes of nausea and vom@@ iting .
in chem@@ o@@ therapies , which are strong trigger for nausea and vom@@ iting , 59 % of patients treated with al@@ op@@ al showed no vom@@ iting in the 24 hours after chemotherapy ( 132 of 2@@ 23 ) , compared to 57 % of patients treated with on@@ dan@@ set@@ ron ( 126 of 2@@ 21 ) .
in the case of chem@@ o@@ therapies , the moderate nausea and vom@@ iting triggers , 81 % of patients who were treated with al@@ op@@ al showed no vom@@ iting in the 24 hours after chemotherapy ( 153 of 18@@ 9 ) , compared to 69 % of patients treated with on@@ dan@@ set@@ ron ( 127 from 185 ) .
in a comparison with Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron these values were 63 % for Alo@@ xi ( 119 of 18@@ 9 patients ) and 53 % for Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron ( 101 of 191 patients ) .
in March 2005 , the European Commission issued approval for the transport of Alo@@ xi in the entire European Union to the company of Helsinki Bi@@ re@@ x Pharmaceuticals Ltd .
al@@ oh@@ xi is indicated for prevention of acute nausea and vom@@ iting in strongly em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy as a result of cancer and for the prevention of nausea and vom@@ iting in moder@@ ately em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy due to cancer .
the efficacy of Alo@@ xi for the prevention of nausea and vom@@ iting caused by a strongly em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy can be ampli@@ fied by adding a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids given before chemotherapy .
since Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron can pro@@ long the col@@ on massage , patients should be closely monitored with an@@ am@@ n@@ esti@@ cal obstruc@@ tions or signs of an acute I@@ le@@ us after injection .
however , as with other 5@@ HT@@ 3 antagon@@ ists , caution is required with simultaneous dispens@@ ing of pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron with medicines that extend the Q@@ T interval or in patients with which the Q@@ t interval is extended or which tend to such an extension .
in addition to a further chem@@ o@@ therapeutic application , Alo@@ xi is not to be used for prevention or treatment of nausea and vom@@ iting in the days following chemotherapy .
in prec@@ lin@@ ical studies , pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron in@@ hibited the activity of the five chem@@ o@@ therapeu@@ tics investigated against tum@@ ors ( c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin , cyclo@@ phosph@@ amide , cy@@ tar@@ ab@@ in , do@@ x@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ in and Mit@@ om@@ y@@ cin C ) .
in a clinical study there was no significant pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tical interaction between a single intraven@@ ous dose Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron and a Ste@@ ady St@@ ate@@ - Con@@ centr@@ ation of oral Met@@ o@@ clo@@ pra@@ i@@ ds , a C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 inhibit@@ or .
in a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic analysis based on a population , the simultaneous administration of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 induc@@ tors ( dex@@ am@@ eth@@ as@@ one and ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in ) as well as C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 inhibit@@ ors ( am@@ eth@@ as@@ one , do@@ x@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ in , flu@@ ox@@ et@@ ine , ran@@ iti@@ dine , k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , ser@@ tr@@ aline and ter@@ bin@@ af@@ ine ) had no significant effect on the Clear@@ ance of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron .
experience of using Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron in human pregn@@ ancies is not available , so Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron should not be used in pregnant women unless it is deemed necessary by the treating physician .
in clinical studies , the most common adverse events in a dose of 250 micro@@ grams ( total of 6@@ 33 patients ) were head@@ aches ( 9 % ) and ob@@ sti@@ p@@ ation ( 5 % ) .
very rare cases ( &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) of hyper@@ sensitivity reactions and reactions to the date of delivery ( burning , har@@ dening , discomfort and pain ) were reported in post @-@ marketing experience reports .
in the group with the highest dosage there were similar occur@@ ren@@ ces of adverse events as in the other dosage groups ; there were no dose @-@ effects to observe .
no di@@ aly@@ sis studies were carried out , but due to the large distribution volume , di@@ aly@@ sis is probably not an effective therapy for an al@@ op@@ ia over@@ dose .
in two random@@ ised double blind studies , a total of 1,@@ 132 patients receiving a moder@@ ately em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy received ≤ 50 mg / m2 cyclo@@ phosph@@ amide and &gt; 25 mg / m2 cyclo@@ phosph@@ amide and &gt; 25 mg / m2 cyclo@@ as@@ et@@ ron ( half @-@ life 7.@@ 3 hours ) , given on day 1 without dex@@ am@@ eth@@ as@@ one intraven@@ ously .
in a random@@ ized double blind study , a total of 6@@ 67 patients receiving a strongly em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy with ≥ 60 mg / m2 cyclo@@ phosph@@ amide and D@@ ac@@ ar@@ ba@@ zin , as well as 250 or 750 micro@@ gram pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron were compared to patients who received 32 mg of on@@ dan@@ set@@ ron given intraven@@ ously on day 1 .
results of the studies with medi@@ cally em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy and the study of strongly em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy are summari@@ zed in the following tables .
in clinical studies for the indication of chemotherapy @-@ induced nausea and vom@@ iting ( C@@ IN@@ V ) , the effects of pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron on blood pressure , heart rate and EC@@ G parameters including the Q@@ t@@ c interval were comparable with the corresponding effects of on@@ dan@@ set@@ ron and dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron .
after the findings of pre @-@ clinical investigations , Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron has the ability to block the ion channels involved in v@@ entri@@ cular de@@ - and rep@@ lic@@ ar@@ isation and extend the duration of the action potential .
the aim of the study carried out in 2@@ 21 healthy volunteers was the assessment of the EC@@ G effects of intraven@@ ous pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron in single doses of 0.@@ 25 , 0.@@ 75 and 2.@@ 25 mg .
res@@ or@@ ption After IV administration follows an initial decrease of the plasma concentrations a slow elimination from the body with an average termin@@ ale half @-@ time of approximately 40 hours .
the average maximum plasma concentration ( C@@ max ) and the surface under the concentration @-@ time curve ( AU@@ C@@ 0@@ - ∞ ) are generally dose @-@ proportional in the entire dose area of 0.@@ 3- 90 μ / kg in healthy and cancer patients .
after intraven@@ ous administration of pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron 0.@@ 25 mg every second day for a total of 3 doses , the mean ( ± SD ) increase in pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron plasma concentration was 42 ± 34 % between day 1 and day 5 .
pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic simulations indicate that once daily intraven@@ ous administration of 0.@@ 25 mg pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron was comparable to 3 consecutive days , total tex@@ til@@ isation ( AU@@ C@@ 0@@ - ∞ ) was comparable with the measured value measured after one @-@ time intraven@@ ous administration of 0.@@ 75 mg ; however , the C@@ max was higher after the dispos@@ able of 0.@@ 75 mg .
about 40 % are eliminated by the kidneys and approximately 50 % are converted into two primary metabol@@ ites , which in comparison to Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron have less than 1 % of the antagon@@ istic effect on the 5@@ HT@@ 3 receptor .
in vitro studies for metabolism have shown that C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 and , to a lesser extent , the is@@ o@@ enzyme C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 and C@@ Y@@ P@@ 1@@ A2 involved in the metabolism of pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron .
elimination of an intraven@@ ous single dose of 10 micro@@ grams / kg &#91; 14@@ C &#93; -@@ Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron were found approximately 80 % of the dose within 144 hours in the urine , Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron as un@@ modified ingredient made about 40 % of the given dose .
after one @-@ time intraven@@ ous bolt injection on healthy subjects , the total body was 17@@ 3 ± 73 ml / min and the ren@@ al clearing 53 ± 29 ml / min .
although patients with severe liver dys@@ functions increase the terminal Eli@@ min@@ ation period and the average systemic exposure to pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron , a reduction in the dose is not justified .
in pre @-@ clinical studies , effects were observed only by expos@@ ures that are considered sufficient above the maximum human@@ istic exposure , which suggests a low relevance for clinical use .
10 From prec@@ lin@@ ical studies , there were indications that Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron can only block ion channels in very high concentrations , which are involved in v@@ entri@@ cular degeneration and rep@@ lic@@ ar@@ isation and can pro@@ long the period of action .
high doses of pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron ( each dose correspon@@ ded to approximately 30 times the therapeutic exposure in humans ) , which were given daily over two years , resulted in increased frequency of liver tumours , endo@@ cr@@ ine ne@@ oplas@@ ma ( in thy@@ roid , p@@ itu@@ itary , pancre@@ as , adren@@ al marks ) and skin tumours in rats , but not in mice .
the underlying mechanisms are not fully known , but due to the high dos@@ ages used and since Alo@@ xi is determined by humans for unique application , the relevance of these results is low as for humans .

in June 2006 , the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) adopted a negative report recommended by the allocation of approval for the market for the treatment of hepatitis C drug Al@@ ph@@ eon 6 million IE / ml injection solution .
this means that Al@@ ph@@ eon should resem@@ ble a biological medicine called Ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A with the same medicinal ingredient that is already approved in the EU ( also called &quot; reference drug &quot; ) .
Al@@ ph@@ eon should be used to treat adult patients with chronic ( long @-@ lasting ) hepatitis C ( a liver disease caused by a viral infection ) .
in a micro@@ scopic examination , the liver tissue has damage , and the values of the liver enzyme Alan@@ ine Amin@@ otran@@ s@@ fer@@ ase ( AL@@ T ) in the blood are increased .
it is produced by a yeast in which a gene ( DNA ) was introduced to stimulate the formation of the active substance .
Al@@ ph@@ eon produced data that demonstrates the comparison of Al@@ ph@@ eon with Ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A ( drug structure , composition and purity of the drug , mode of action , safety and efficacy in hepatitis C ) .
in the study of hepatitis C patients , the efficacy of al@@ ph@@ onic was compared to 4@@ 55 patients with the efficacy of the reference resin .
in the study , it was measured how many patients reported after 12 of a total of 48 treatment weeks and 6 months after the treatment was set on the drug ( i.e. no sign of virus in the blood reported ) .
( 44 @-@ 20 ) 74 18 84 00 Fax ( 44 @-@ 20 ) 74 18 84 16 E @-@ mail : mail @ em@@ e@@ a.@@ eu@@ .@@ int ht@@ t@@ p : / / www.@@ em@@ e@@ a.@@ eu@@ .@@ int © E@@ MEA 2006 Re@@ production and / or distribution of this document is Au@@ thor@@ ised for non @-@ commercial purposes only provided the E@@ MEA is acknowledged .
in addition , concerns have been expressed that data on the stability of the drug and the drug to be marketed cannot be sufficient .
the number of hepatitis C patients who responded to the treatment with Al@@ ph@@ eon and Ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A was similar in the clinical trial .
after the treatment with Al@@ ph@@ eon the disease appeared again in more patients than with the reference medicinal product ; moreover , Al@@ ph@@ eon has more side effects .
apart from this , the test used in the study was not sufficiently validated to investigate the extent to which the medicine forms an immune response ( i.e. the body forms antibodies - special proteins - against the drug ) .
it can be used for the treatment of Im@@ pe@@ tig@@ o ( a skin infection associated with crust formation ) and small infected in@@ fir@@ s ( crack or cut wounds ) , abra@@ sions and se@@ wed wounds .
Al@@ tar@@ go is not to be used to treat infections that have been proven or presumably caused by meth@@ ic@@ il@@ lin@@ resistant Stap@@ hy@@ lo@@ co@@ cc@@ us au@@ re@@ us ( MR@@ SA ) because al@@ arms may not work against this type of infection .
Al@@ tar@@ go can be used in patients from the age of nine months , but in patients under 18 years , the area to be treated may not exceed 2 % of the body surface .
if the patient does not respond to the treatment after two or three days , the doctor should examine the patient again and consider alternative treatments .
it works by blocking the bacterial ri@@ bos@@ omes ( the parts of the bacterial cell where proteins are produced ) and thereby inhi@@ bits the growth of bacteria .
the main indicator of efficacy was in all five studies the proportion of patients whose infection was cl@@ ung after the end of the treatment .
119 ( 8@@ 5.@@ 6 % ) of 139 patients under Al@@ tar@@ go and 37 ( 5@@ 2.1 % ) of 71 patients under placebo responded to treatment .
in the treatment of infected skin wounds , Al@@ tar@@ go and C@@ ef@@ al@@ ex@@ in showed similar response rates : if the results of both studies were taken together at home wounds , about 90 % of patients of both groups responded to treatment .
in these two studies , however , it was found that Al@@ tar@@ go was not effective enough in the treatment of ab@@ sc@@ esses ( stained @-@ filled cavi@@ ties in the body tissue ) or infections that have been proven or presumably caused by MR@@ SA .
the most common side effect with Al@@ tar@@ go ( which was observed from 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) is a irritation at the sur@@ facing point .
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that the benefits of Al@@ tar@@ go during short @-@ term treatment of the following superficial skin infections prevailed against the risks : • Im@@ pe@@ tig@@ o , • infected small in@@ fir@@ s , abra@@ sions or se@@ wn wounds .
in May 2007 , the European Commission issued a licence for the company Gla@@ xo Group Ltd. for the placing on the market of Al@@ tar@@ go throughout the European Union .
patients with no improvement within two to three days should be examined again and an alternative therapy should be considered ( see section 4.4 ) .
in the event of a sensi@@ bil@@ isation or severe local irritation by the use of Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin Sal@@ be the treatment should be stopped , the o@@ int@@ ment carefully wi@@ ped out and an appropriate alternative therapy of the infection is started .
Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin should not be used for the treatment of infections in which MR@@ SA is known or suspected ( see section 5.1 ) .
in clinical studies with secondary infected open wounds , the efficacy of Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin was insufficient in patients with infections caused by a meth@@ ic@@ ill@@ in @-@ resistant Stap@@ hy@@ lo@@ co@@ cc@@ us au@@ re@@ us ( MR@@ SA ) .
alternative therapy should be taken into account if no improvement or deterioration of the infected area occurs after 2 to 3 @-@ day treatment .
the effect of simultaneous use of Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin and other topical remedies on the same skin surface has not been examined and the simultaneous use of other topical drugs is not recommended .
due to the low plasma concentrations that were achieved in humans after topical application on sk@@ ewed skin or infected superficial wounds , clin@@ ically relevant in@@ hibition in vivo is not expected ( see Section 5.2 ) .
3 After simultaneous oral administration of 2 times daily 200 mg of k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole , the mean Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin AU@@ C ( 0 @-@ 24 ) and C@@ max according to topical application of 1 % Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ inal Sal@@ be on de@@ ported skin of healthy adult men increased by 81 % .
due to the low systemic exposure to topical application in patients , dose adjustments are not required when topical Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is applied during systemic treatment with C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors .
animal studies have shown a reproductive toxic@@ ity after oral ing@@ es@@ tion and are inadequate in relation to a statement of effects on the birth and the fet@@ al / post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) .
retin@@ ot@@ am@@ ulin Sal@@ be should only be used during pregnancy if topical anti@@ bacterial therapy is clearly indicated and the application of Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is prefer@@ able to a systemic antibiotic .
when deciding whether breast@@ feeding continues / stops or the therapy should be continued with Al@@ tar@@ go , it is necessary to weigh between the benefits of breast@@ feeding for the baby and the benefit of the Al@@ tar@@ go therapy for woman .
in clinical studies of 2@@ 150 patients with superficial skin infections , which were used by Al@@ tar@@ go , the most common reported side effect of irritation at the date of delivery was about 1 % of the patients .
mode of action Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is a semi @-@ synthetic deriv@@ ative of leu@@ ro@@ mu@@ ti@@ lin , a substance that is isolated by fermentation from Cl@@ it@@ op@@ il@@ us pass@@ ed@@ anus ( formerly ple@@ ur@@ ot@@ us pass@@ ed@@ anus ) .
the mechanism of action of Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is based on selective in@@ hibition of bacterial protein synthesis by inter@@ acting on a specific binding site of the 50s sub@@ unit of bacterial ri@@ bos@@ oms , which differs from the binding sites of other ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al inter@@ acting anti @-@ bacterial substances .
data indicates that the binding site of ri@@ bos@@ om@@ ale protein L@@ 3 is involved in the region of the ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al P engagement site and the pe@@ p@@ ti@@ dy@@ l@@ transfer@@ ase centre .
binding to this binding site inhi@@ bits pe@@ an@@ ro@@ mu@@ ti@@ line the pe@@ p@@ tide transfer , block partial P @-@ binding adjustment interactions and prevent normal formation of active 50s ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al sub@@ units .
if , due to the local pre@@ val@@ ence of resistance , the application of retin@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin at least some types of infection appears question@@ able , consultation by experts should be sought .
there were no differences in the In @-@ vitro activity of retin@@ os@@ am@@ ulin compared to S.@@ au@@ re@@ us , regardless of whether the isol@@ ates were sensitive or resistant to meth@@ ic@@ ill@@ in .
in the event of non @-@ appeal to the treatment of S.@@ au@@ re@@ us , the presence of strains with additional vir@@ ul@@ ence factors ( such as PV@@ L = P@@ anton @-@ Valent@@ ine Leu@@ co@@ ci@@ din ) should be considered .
res@@ or@@ ption In a study with healthy adults , 1 % Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin Sal@@ be was applied daily under oc@@ clu@@ sion on intact and sc@@ aled skin for up to 7 days .
of 5@@ 16 patients ( adults and children ) who received 1 % Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin Sal@@ be twice daily for 5 days for topical treatment of secondary infected trau@@ matic wounds , individual plasma samples were obtained .
the sampling was performed on days 3 or 4 in the adult patients before medication and in children between 0 @-@ 12 hours after the last application .
however , the maximum individual systemic exposure to humans after topical application of 1 % o@@ int@@ ment to 200 c@@ m2 sh@@ red@@ ded skin ( C@@ max = 22 ng / ml ; AU@@ C ( 0 @-@ 24 ) = 2@@ 38 ng · h / ml ) was 6@@ 60 times lower than the Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin IC@@ 50 for P@@ GP in@@ hibition .
metabolism The in vitro oxid@@ ative metabol@@ ism of retin@@ os@@ am@@ ulin in human liver micro@@ som@@ ites was primarily medi@@ ated by C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , with low participation of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ C@@ 8 and C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 ( see section 4.5 ) .
in studies on oral toxic@@ ity of rats ( 50 , 150 or 450 mg / kg ) carried out over 14 days , there were signs of adaptive liver and thy@@ roid changes .
in @-@ vitro investigation of gene mut@@ ation and / or chromos@@ om@@ al effects in the mouse lymph@@ oma test resp@@ . in cultures of human peripheral blood lymp@@ ho@@ cytes as well as in the rats @-@ micro@@ kernel test for in vivo examination of chromos@@ om@@ al effects .
there was neither male nor female rats any signs of reduced fertility in oral dosing of 50 , 150 or 450 mg / kg / day , whereby one to 5 times higher exposure was achieved than the highest estimated exposure to humans ( topical application on 200 c@@ m2 grin@@ ded skin :
in an embry@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity study on rats , oral dos@@ ages of ≥ 150 mg / kg / day ( corresponding to the ≥ 3 @-@ fold of the estimated human exposure ( see above ) , development toxic@@ ity ( decreased body weight of the fet@@ us and delayed oscill@@ ation ) and mat@@ ernal toxic@@ ity were detected .
the holder of approval for placing on the market must ensure that a pharmac@@ o@@ vig@@ il@@ ance system , as presented in Module 1.@@ 8.1 of the Ad@@ mission Application ( Version 6.@@ 2 ) , works before the product is marketed and as long as the marketed product is applied .

as described in the CH@@ MP &quot; Gui@@ deline on Risk Management Systems for medicinal products for human use , &quot; the updated channel is to be submitted simultaneously with the next Peri@@ odi@@ c Safety Update Report .
irritation or other signs and symptoms at the treated area indicate that you should quit the application of Al@@ tar@@ go and talk to your doctor .
do not apply any other o@@ int@@ ments , cre@@ ams or l@@ oti@@ ons on the surface treated with Al@@ tar@@ go unless specifically prescribed by your doctor .

Ambi@@ rix is used to protect hepatitis A and hepatitis B ( diseases affecting the liver ) in children aged between one and 15 years , who are not immune to these two diseases .
Ambi@@ rix is being used as part of a two doses existing vacc@@ ination plan , whereby a protection against hepatitis B may only be reached after the second dose is administered .
therefore , Ambi@@ rix may only be used if there is a low risk of hepatitis B infection during the imm@@ uni@@ zation process and it is ensured that the vacc@@ ination plan existing from two doses can end .
if a ref@@ res@@ her dose is requested against hepatitis A or B , Ambi@@ rix or another hepatitis A or B vaccine may be given .
vacc@@ ines work by helping the immune system ( the body &apos;s natural defense ) , as it can defend itself against a disease .
after a child has received the vaccine , the immune system recognis@@ es the viruses and surface anti@@ gens as &quot; foreign &quot; and produces antibodies against it .
Ambi@@ rix contains the same constitu@@ ents as the first @-@ registered V@@ acc@@ ine Twin@@ rix adult and the vacc@@ ines admitted since 1997 with Twin@@ rix children since 1997 .
the three vacc@@ ines are used to protect against the same diseases , but Twin@@ rix adults and Twin@@ rix are administered as part of a three dos@@ ages vacc@@ ination plan .
because Ambi@@ rix and Twin@@ rix contain adults identical ingredients , some of the data that supports the application of Twin@@ rix adults were also used as evidence of the application of Ambi@@ rix .
the main indicator of efficacy was the proportion of vacc@@ inated children who had developed a protective antibody concentration one month after the last injection .
in an additional study involving 20@@ 8 children , the efficacy of the vaccine was compared with a six @-@ month and a 12 month distance between the two inj@@ ections .
Ambi@@ rix rates between 98 and 100 % of vacc@@ inated children one month after the last injection for the development of protective antibody concentrations against hepatitis A and B .
the additional study showed that the degree of protection of Ambi@@ rix in a 6 @-@ month interval between the inj@@ ections was similar .
the most common side effects of Ambi@@ rix ( observed with more than 1 out of 10 vaccine doses ) are headache , lack of appetite , pain at the injection site , redness , mat@@ ernity ( fatigue ) as well as irrit@@ ability .
Ambi@@ rix may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to the active ingredients , one of the other components or ne@@ om@@ y@@ cin ( an antibiotic ) .
in August 2002 , the European Commission issued Gla@@ x@@ o@@ Smi@@ th@@ K@@ line Bi@@ ologi@@ cals for the company Gla@@ x@@ o@@ Smi@@ th@@ K@@ line .
the standardi@@ zation plan for pri@@ ming with Ambi@@ rix consists of two doses , the first dose at the date of choice and the second dose ranges between six and twelve months after the first dose .
if a booster shot is desired both for hepatitis A and hepatitis B , vacc@@ ines can be vacc@@ inated with the appropriate mon@@ ov@@ al@@ ent vacc@@ ines or with a combination vaccine .
the anti @-@ hepatitis B @-@ an@@ tigen ( anti @-@ HB@@ s@@ A@@ g ) and anti @-@ hepatitis A virus ( anti @-@ HB@@ s@@ A@@ g ) and anti @-@ hepatitis A virus ( anti @-@ HA@@ V ) antibodies are in the same magnitude as after vacc@@ ination with the respective mon@@ ov@@ al@@ ent vacc@@ ines .
it is not yet fully assured whether immun@@ o@@ competent persons who have addressed a hepatitis A vacc@@ ination need a booster as protection , as they may also be protected by immun@@ ological memory even in non @-@ det@@ ectable antibodies .
3 As with all injection vacc@@ ines , an an@@ ap@@ hy@@ lac@@ tic reaction after the application of the vaccine should always be immediately available for medical treatment and monitoring .
if a rapid protection against hepatitis B is required , the combination vaccine is recommended , containing 360 ELISA units of form@@ al@@ in@@ activated hepatitis A virus and 10 µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen .
in hem@@ odi@@ aly@@ sis patients and persons with disorders of the immune system , there may be no sufficient anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ - and anti @-@ HB@@ s antibody value after pri@@ ming , so that further doses may be required in these cases .
since intra@@ muscular injection or intra@@ muscular administration in the glut@@ eal muscle could lead to an optimal imp@@ eller success , these injection routes should be avoided .
in the case of th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ top@@ en@@ ia or blood cl@@ ot@@ ting disorders , Ambi@@ rix can be inj@@ ected sub@@ cut@@ an@@ e@@ ously , as it can result in bleeding in these cases after intra@@ muscular administration .
if Ambi@@ rix was given in the form of a separate injection at the same time with a combined di@@ ph@@ th@@ eria , tet@@ anus , ac@@ ell@@ ular per@@ t@@ uss@@ i , in@@ activated poli@@ om@@ y@@ eli@@ tis and ha@@ em@@ op@@ hil@@ us influ@@ enz@@ ae type b vaccine ( DT@@ PA @-@ IP@@ V / HI@@ B ) or with a combined m@@ um@@ ps m@@ um@@ ps @-@ rub@@ ella vaccine , the immune response to all anti@@ gens was sufficient ( see Section 5.1 ) .
in patients suffering from immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy or in patients with immune defects , it has to be assumed that there may be no adequate immune response .
in a clinical study conducted with 3 doses of this formulation in adults , the frequency of pain , redness , swelling , mat@@ edness , gastro@@ ent@@ eri@@ tis , headache and fever , comparable to the frequency observed in earlier thi@@ ers and preserv@@ ative @-@ containing vaccine formulation .
in clinical trials 20@@ 29 doses of Ambi@@ rix were administered to a total of 10@@ 27 vacc@@ ines at the age of 1 to 15 years .
in a study involving 300 participants aged 12 to 15 years , the tolerance of Ambi@@ rix was compared with the 3 @-@ dose @-@ combination vaccine .
only exceptions were the higher frequencies of pain and difference based on a calculation basis per V@@ acc@@ dose Ambi@@ rix , but not based on a calculation basis per person .
pain was observed after the administration of Ambi@@ rix in 50@@ ,@@ 7 % of the subjects compared to 3@@ 9.@@ 1 % in subjects after the addition of a dose of 3 doses of combination vaccine .
according to the complete vacc@@ ination cycle , 6@@ 6.@@ 4 % of the subjects who had given Ambi@@ rix had reported pain , compared to 6@@ 3.8 % in the subjects who had been vacc@@ inated using the 3 @-@ dose combination vaccine .
the frequency of Mat@@ ernity was , however , comparable high per pro@@ band ( i.e. about the entire vacc@@ ination cycle at 3@@ 9.@@ 6 % of the subjects who received Ambi@@ rix in comparison to 3@@ 6.2 % in subjects receiving the 3 @-@ dose combination vaccine ) .
the frequency of severe pain and mat@@ ernity was low and comparable to those observed after the combination vaccine was administered with the 3 doses vacc@@ ination scheme .
in a comparative study of 1- to 11 @-@ year @-@ old vacc@@ ines , the incidence of local reactions and general reactions in the Ambi@@ ri@@ x@@ Group was comparable to that observed when administered with the 3 @-@ doses combination vaccine with 360 ELISA units of form@@ al@@ in@@ activated hepatitis A virus and 10 µ@@ g of re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen .
in the 6@@ - to 11 @-@ year @-@ olds , however , after vacc@@ ination with Ambi@@ rix a frequent occurrence of pain ( at the injection site ) per dose , not per pro@@ band , was reported .
the proportion of vacc@@ ines reported by severe side effects during the 2 @-@ doses vaccine with Ambi@@ rix or during the 3 doses vaccine with the combination vaccine with 360 EL@@ IS@@ A@@ - units of form@@ al@@ in@@ activated hepatitis B virus and 10 µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen was not statisti@@ cally different .
in clinical trials conducted in vacc@@ ines at the age of 1 to 15 years , the anti @-@ HA@@ V serum rates for anti @-@ HA@@ V 9@@ 9.@@ 1 % were one month after the first dose and 100 % one month after the second dose ( i.e. in month 7 ) .
the Ser@@ o@@ conver@@ sions for anti @-@ HB@@ s were 7@@ 4.2 % one month after the first dose and 100 % one month after the second dose ( i.e. in month 7 ) .
7 In a comparative study conducted in 12@@ - to including 15 @-@ year @-@ olds , 142 two doses of Ambi@@ rix and 147 received the standard combination vaccine with three doses .
in the 28@@ 9 people whose immun@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity was worth@@ less , the ser@@ op@@ rot@@ ection rates ( SP in the table below ) against hepatitis B in the month 2 and 6 after the addition of the 3 @-@ dose vaccine were significantly higher than with Ambi@@ rix .
the immune responses , which were achieved in a clinical comparative study at 1 to 11 @-@ year @-@ old one month after completion of the full ino@@ cul@@ ation series ( i.e. in month 7 ) , are listed in the following table .
in both studies , the ino@@ cul@@ ations received either a 2 @-@ doses vacc@@ ination scheme with Ambi@@ rix or a 3 @-@ doses vaccine with a combination vaccine with 360 ELISA units of form@@ al@@ in@@ activated hepatitis A virus and 10@@ µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen .
for people who were between 12 and 15 years old at the time of pri@@ ming , the persist@@ ence of anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ - and anti @-@ HB@@ s antibodies could be proven for at least 24 months after imm@@ uni@@ zation with Ambi@@ rix in the 0 @-@ 6 @-@ month vacc@@ ination scheme .
the immune response observed in this study was comparable to those detected after vacc@@ ination of 3 doses with a combination vaccine consisting of 360 ELISA units of form@@ al@@ in@@ in@@ activated H@@ ep@@ ati@@ tis@@ - A virus and 10 µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen in a dose volume of 0.5 ml .
in a clinical study at 12@@ - to including 15 @-@ year @-@ olds , it was shown that the persist@@ ence of anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ s and anti @-@ HB@@ s antibodies is comparable 24 months after imm@@ uni@@ zation in the 0 @-@ 6 @-@ month vacc@@ ination scheme , compared to the 0 @-@ 12 @-@ month vacc@@ ination scheme .
if the first dose of Ambi@@ rix in the second year of life was administered simultaneously with the booster shot of a combined di@@ ph@@ th@@ eria , tet@@ anus , ac@@ ell@@ ular per@@ t@@ uss@@ i , in@@ activated poli@@ om@@ y@@ eli@@ tis and 8 ha@@ em@@ op@@ hil@@ us influ@@ enz@@ ae vaccine vaccine , the immune response to all anti@@ gens was sufficient .
a clinical study conducted with 3 doses of the present formulation in adults showed similar ser@@ op@@ rot@@ ection and ser@@ o@@ conver@@ sions as for earlier formulation of the present formulation .
the vaccine is to be examined both before and after the res@@ us@@ pen@@ ing of any foreign particles and / or physical visible changes .
pursuant to Article 114 of the Directive 2001 / 83 / EC , the State Char@@ ge Lic@@ ens@@ ing is carried out by a state laboratory or laboratory authorized for this purpose .

the hepatitis A virus is usually transmitted through virus @-@ containing foods and beverages , but can also be transmitted through other ways , such as swimming in waters contaminated by sewage .
you may feel very tired , have a dark urine , a pale face , yellow skin and / or eyes ( ja@@ un@@ dice ) and other symptoms that possibly require a stationary treatment .
as with all vacc@@ ines , Ambi@@ rix cannot fully protect against infection with hepatitis B or hepatitis B virus , even if the complete ino@@ cul@@ ation series has been completed with 2 doses .
if you / your child is infected with hepatitis A or hepatitis B virus prior to the adoption of both vacc@@ ines , vacc@@ ination may not prevent a disease .
protection against other infections causing damage to the liver or causing symptoms similar to those of hepatitis B or hepatitis B infection cannot be medi@@ ated .
• If you have already shown an allergic reaction to Ambi@@ rix or any part of this vaccine , including Ne@@ om@@ y@@ cin ( an antibiotic ) ,
an allergic reaction can manifest itself through it@@ chy skin r@@ ashes , short@@ ness of breath or swelling of the face or tongue . • If you have an allergic reaction to an earlier vacc@@ ination against hepatitis A or Hepatitis B , if you / your child has a severe infection with fever .
• If you want to have a quick protection against hepatitis B ( i.e. within 6 months and before the scheduled dose of the second vaccine ) .
at a possible risk of hepatitis B infection between the first and second vacc@@ ination , the doctor will advise you / your child from vacc@@ ination with Ambi@@ rix .
instead , it will recommend you / your child 3 inj@@ ections of a combined Hepatitis B / Hepatitis B vaccine with a reduced content of effective ingredients per V@@ acc@@ ine ( 360 ELISA units of a form@@ al@@ in@@ in@@ activated hepatitis A virus and 10 micro@@ grams of a re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface finish ) .
the second vaccine dose of this vaccine with reduced content of effective ingredients is usually given one month after the first dose and is likely to give you a vacc@@ ination protection before ending the vacc@@ ination series .
sometimes Ambi@@ rix gets infected with people who suffer from severe blood cl@@ ot@@ ting disorders , under the skin and not in the muscle . • If you / your child are weakened due to a disease or treatment in your body or if you / your child undergo a hem@@ odi@@ aly@@ sis .
Ambi@@ rix may be given in these cases , but the immune response of these individuals on vacc@@ ination may not be sufficient so that a blood test may be necessary to see how strongly the reaction to vacc@@ ination is .
21 Tell your doctor if you / your child is taking other medicines / intake ( including those you can get without prescription ) or if you / your child has been vacc@@ inated / has been given or immune to immun@@ o@@ glob@@ ul@@ ins ( antibodies ) or has been planned in the near future .
however , it may be that in this case the immune response to the vaccine is not sufficient and the person is therefore not protected against one or both hepatitis A and B viruses .
if another vaccine must be given at the same time with Ambi@@ rix , it should be vacc@@ inated in separate areas and as many extre@@ mi@@ ties as possible .
if Ambi@@ rix is to be administered at the same time or shortly before or after an injection of immun@@ o@@ glob@@ ul@@ ins , it is likely that the reaction to the vaccine will still be sufficient .
typically , Ambi@@ rix &apos;s pregnant or breast@@ feeding women are not given , unless they are urgently needed to be vacc@@ inated against hepatitis A as well as hepatitis B .
important information about specific other components of Ambi@@ rix Please inform your doctor if you have already shown an allergic reaction to ne@@ om@@ y@@ cin ( antibiotic ) .
if you miss the agreed date for the second vacc@@ ination , talk to your doctor and arrange a new appointment as soon as possible .
♦ A lot of pain ( more than 1 case per 10 inj@@ ected cans ) : • P@@ ain or discomfort on the spot or redness • Mat@@ eness • irrit@@ ability • Head@@ ache • Appeti@@ tes lack of appetite
♦ frequently ( up to 1 case per 10 inj@@ ected cans ) : • swelling at the injection site • F@@ ever fever ( above 38 ° C ) • Con@@ di@@ gious diseases • Ga@@ stro @-@ intestinal disorders
further side effects , which were reported days or weeks after vacc@@ ination with comparable combination or single vacc@@ ines against hepatitis A and hepatitis B ( less than 1 case per 10,000 vacc@@ inated cans ) , are :
these include local limited or extended precip@@ itation , which can be it@@ chy or bli@@ stering , swelling of the eye contours and the face , difficult breathing or swal@@ lowing , sudden loss of blood pressure and un@@ consciousness .

23 In@@ form your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if any of the listed adverse events you / your child is significantly impaired or you notice side effects that are not stated in this package .
Ambi@@ rix is available in packs of 1 and 10 with or without need@@ les and in packs of 50 without need@@ les .
on the basis of the data that has been known since issu@@ ance of the first approval for placing on the market , the CH@@ MP advoc@@ ated that the benefit @-@ risk ratio for Ambi@@ rix remains positive .
however , since Ambi@@ rix was only placed in circulation in a Member State ( in the Netherlands since May 2003 ) , the available safety data for this medicine is limited due to low patient exposure .
am@@ mon@@ aps can also be used in patients at the age of over a month with in@@ complete enz@@ ym@@ atic defect or hyper@@ ammon@@ ia en@@ cephal@@ opathy ( brain damage due to high ammon@@ ia concentrations ) in pre@@ history .
am@@ mon@@ aps is - split to several individual doses at meals - swal@@ lowed , mixed under the food or administered via a gastro@@ stom@@ i@@ es@@ l@@ auch ( through the abdominal wall into the stomach of the leading tube ) or a nas@@ al probe ( through the nose into the stomach of the leading hose ) .
it was not a comparative study because Am@@ mon@@ y could not be compared with another treatment or placebo ( a placebo , i.e. without active ingredient ) .
Am@@ mon@@ ella can also cause loss of appetite , a abnormal acid content in the blood , depression , irrit@@ ability , headache , f@@ ain@@ ting , fluid retention , taste disturbances or taste a@@ version , stomach pain , vom@@ iting , nausea , con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation , rash , unpleasant body odor or weight gain .
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that ammon@@ ia in patients with disorders of the ure@@ a cycle effectively prevented high ammon@@ ia levels .
Am@@ mon@@ t@@ aps were approved under &quot; extraordinary circumstances &quot; because only limited information about this medicine was given due to the r@@ arity of the disease at the time of approval .
the use is indicated in all patients in which a complete enzyme deficiency already mani@@ f@@ ests itself in new@@ bor@@ ns ( within the first 28 days of life ) .
in patients with a late @-@ mani@@ um form ( incomplete enzyme defect which mani@@ f@@ ests itself after the first month of life ) , there is an indication of the use if a hyper@@ ammon@@ ia en@@ cephal@@ opathy is present in the an@@ am@@ n@@ esis .
for infants , for children who are unable to swal@@ low tablets or for patients with hi@@ cc@@ ups , AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS is also available in gran@@ ular form .
the daily dose is calculated individually , taking into account protein tolerance and the daily protein intake needed for the patient &apos;s growth and development .
according to previous clinical experience , the normal daily dose sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate : • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day in children with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9.@@ 9 - 13,@@ 0 g / m ² / day with children with a body weight of over 20 kg and for adolescents and adults .
the sub@@ stitution of cit@@ rul@@ line or ar@@ gin@@ ine in a dose of 0.@@ 17 g / kg / day or 3.8 g / m ² / day is required for patients who suffer from an early @-@ mani@@ fac@@ et lack of Car@@ bam@@ yl@@ phosph@@ ate syn@@ th@@ et@@ ase or or@@ ni@@ eth@@ in@@ tran@@ scar@@ can@@ ase .
patients with an ar@@ gin@@ in@@ os@@ u@@ cc@@ in@@ atal syn@@ th@@ et@@ ase deficiency have to obtain ar@@ gin@@ ine in a dosage of 0.4 - 0.@@ 7 g / kg / day or 8.@@ 8 - 15.@@ 4 g / m ² / day .
AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS tablets may not be given to patients with hi@@ cc@@ ups because there is a risk of the development of es@@ op@@ hag@@ us ul@@ cer@@ a when the tablets do not immediately get into the stomach .
each tablet AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS contains 62 mg ( 2,@@ 7 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium , accordingly 2.5 g ( 108 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium per 20 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate , which corresponds to the maximum daily dose .
AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS should therefore be used in patients with con@@ ges@@ tive heart failure or severe ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency as well as with sodium retention and o@@ dem@@ a @-@ associated clinical conditions with caution .
since the metabolism and ex@@ cre@@ tion of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat occurs over the liver and kidneys , AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS should only be used with extreme care in patients with liver or kidney failure .
the importance of these results regarding pregnant women is not known ; the use of AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS during pregnancy is therefore contra@@ indicated ( see 4.3 ) .
in sub@@ cut@@ aneous administration of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate in young rats at high doses ( 190 - 4@@ 74 mg / kg ) , the neur@@ onal multip@@ lication slow@@ ed and increased neur@@ ons increased .
there was also a delayed mat@@ ur@@ ation of cereb@@ ral syn@@ ap@@ ses and a dimin@@ ished number of functioning nerve damage in the brain and thus a disability of brain growth .
it could not be determined whether phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate is ex@@ cre@@ ted in humans into breast milk , and for this reason the use of AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS is contra@@ indicated during lac@@ tation period ( see 4.3 ) .
in clinical trials with AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS , 56 % of patients had at least one adverse event ( AE ) and 78 % of these un@@ desirable events have been assumed that they were not associated with AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS .
the frequency is defined as follows : very often ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) , frequently ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) and occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) .
a prob@@ able toxic reaction to AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS ( 450 mg / kg / day ) was reported by an 18 @-@ year old anor@@ ec@@ tic patient who developed a metabolic en@@ cephal@@ opathy associated with lac@@ tic aci@@ dosis , severe hypo@@ kal@@ emia , arm@@ y@@ top@@ en@@ ia , peripheral neu@@ rop@@ athy and pancre@@ atitis .
a case of over@@ dose occ@@ ured in a 5 month old inf@@ ant with an in@@ adver@@ tent single dose of 10 g ( 13@@ 70 mg / kg ) .
these symptoms are associated with the accumulation of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate , which showed a dose @-@ limiting neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity during intraven@@ ous administration of doses of up to 400 mg / kg / day .
phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate is a met@@ abo@@ lically active compound , which is con@@ jug@@ ated by acet@@ yl@@ ation with glut@@ amine to phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine , which is ex@@ cre@@ ted through the kidneys .
phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is comparable to ure@@ a ( both compounds contain 2 nit@@ ric atoms ) ; phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is therefore suitable as an alternative carrier for the ex@@ cre@@ tion of excess nitrogen .
5 Pati@@ ents with disturbances of the ure@@ a cycle can be assumed that for each gram , sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate is produced between 0.@@ 12 and 0.@@ 15 g of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine nitrogen .
it is important that the diagnosis be stopped early and the treatment is started immediately in order to improve the chances of survival and the clinical outcome .
the pro@@ g@@ nosis of the early @-@ manifest form of the disease with the occurrence of the first symptoms in new@@ bor@@ ns was almost always inf@@ au@@ st , and the disease led to death even in treatment with per@@ it@@ one@@ al di@@ aly@@ sis and essential amino acids or with its nitrogen @-@ free analo@@ gues within the first year of life .
by hem@@ odi@@ aly@@ sis , the exploitation of alternative ways of nitrogen ex@@ cre@@ tion ( sodium ben@@ zo@@ ate , sodium ben@@ zo@@ ate and sodium phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate ) , protein @-@ reduced diet and possibly sub@@ stitution of essential amino acids , it was possible to increase the survival rate of new@@ bor@@ ns in post@@ part@@ al ( but within the first month of life ) to 80 % .
in patients whose disease was diagnosed in the course of pregnancy and which were already treated before the first appearance of hyper@@ ammon@@ ia en@@ cephal@@ opathy the survival rate was 100 % , but even in these patients it was time with many mental disabilities or other neuro@@ logical defic@@ its .
in patients with a late @-@ mani@@ fac@@ al form of the disease ( including female patients with hetero@@ zy@@ got@@ ic form of the or@@ ni@@ eth@@ in@@ tran@@ scar@@ can@@ ase deficiency ) , who recovered from hyper@@ ammon@@ ia en@@ cephal@@ opathy and were subsequently treated with sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate and a protein @-@ reduced diet , the survival rate was 98 % .
already existing neuro@@ logical defic@@ its are hardly reversible even in the treatment and in some patients a further deterioration of the neuro@@ logical condition can occur .
it is known that phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat is oxi@@ di@@ zed to phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate , which is con@@ jug@@ ated with glut@@ amine in the liver and kidneys , whereby phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is produced .
the concentrations of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate and his metabol@@ ites in plasma and urine were determined after the addition of a single dose of 5 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate in so@@ ber healthy adults and in patients with disturbances of the ure@@ a cycle , hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in metabolism and with liver cir@@ rho@@ sis as well as repeated gifts of oral doses of up to 20 g / day ( non @-@ controlled studies ) .
phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate and metabol@@ ites were also studied in cancer patients with sodium poly@@ phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate ( up to 2 g / m ² ) or phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate .
after an oral single dose of 5 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat in tablet form , measured plasma concentrations of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat were detected 15 minutes after in@@ gest@@ ing .
in the majority of patients with ure@@ a @-@ cycli@@ c disorders or hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in opath@@ ies , phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate ( 300 @-@ 650 mg / kg / day up to 20 g / day ) was not det@@ ectable in the next morning after ni@@ gh@@ tly fasting .
in three of six patients with cir@@ rho@@ sis of the liver , which were repeatedly treated with sodium poly@@ phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate ( 20 g / day or@@ ally in three single doses ) , the mean phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate concentrations were five times higher on the third day than after the first gifts .
ex@@ cre@@ tion This medication is ex@@ cre@@ ted within 24 hours to about 80 - 100 % in the form of the con@@ jug@@ ated product Phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine over the kidneys .
according to Mic@@ ron@@ u@@ cle@@ us test results , sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat had no exc@@ ru@@ ci@@ ated effects in the rats treated with toxic and non @-@ toxic cans ( examination 24 and 48 h after oral dosing of an individual dose of 8@@ 78 to 28@@ 00 mg / kg ) .
AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS gran@@ ulate is taken or@@ ally ( infants and children who cannot swal@@ low tablets , or patients with hi@@ cc@@ ups ) or via a gastro@@ stom@@ i@@ pad or a nas@@ al probe .
according to previous clinical experience , the normal daily dose sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate : • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day with new@@ bor@@ ns , infants and children with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9.@@ 9 - 13,@@ 0 g / m ² / day with children with a body weight of over 20 kg and for adolescents and adults .
the concentration of ammon@@ ia , ar@@ gin@@ ine , essential amino acids ( especially bran@@ ched chain amino acids ) , car@@ nit@@ ine and serum proteins in the plasma should be kept within the normal range .
the sub@@ stitution of cit@@ rul@@ line or ar@@ gin@@ ine in a dose of 0.@@ 17 g / kg / day or 3.8 g / m ² / day is required for patients who suffer from an early @-@ mani@@ fac@@ et lack of Car@@ bam@@ yl@@ phosph@@ ate syn@@ th@@ et@@ ase or or@@ ni@@ eth@@ in@@ tran@@ scar@@ can@@ ase .
AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS gran@@ ulate contains 124 mg ( 5.@@ 4 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium per gram of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate , equivalent to 2.5 g ( 108 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium per 20 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate , which corresponds to the maximum daily dose .
if rats were subjected to phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate ( active metabol@@ ite of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat ) before birth , lesi@@ ons in the pyrami@@ ds of the cereb@@ ral cor@@ tex occurred .
a prob@@ able toxic reaction to AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS ( 450 mg / kg / day ) was reported by an 18 @-@ year old anor@@ ec@@ tic patient who developed a metabolic en@@ cephal@@ opathy associated with lac@@ tic aci@@ dosis , severe hypo@@ kal@@ emia , arm@@ y@@ top@@ en@@ ia , peripheral neu@@ rop@@ athy and pancre@@ atitis .
phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is comparable to ure@@ a ( both compounds contain 2 nit@@ ric atoms ) ; phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is therefore suitable as an alternative carrier for the ex@@ cre@@ tion of surplus
on the basis of studies on the ex@@ cre@@ tion of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine in patients with disorders of the ure@@ a cycle , it can be assumed that a mon@@ ol@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate of 0.@@ 12 and 0.@@ 15 g of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine @-@ nitrogen is produced for each gram .
already existing neuro@@ logical defic@@ its are hardly reversible in the treatment , and in some patients a further deterioration of the neuro@@ logical condition can occur .
after an oral single dose of 5 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat in gran@@ ular form , measured plasma concentrations of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat were detected 15 minutes after in@@ gest@@ ing .
during the duration of the shelf life , the patient can store the finished product once for a period of 3 months at a temperature of not exceeding 25 ° C .
in this procedure , the small measuring spoon contains 0,@@ 95 g , the mean measuring spoon 2.@@ 9 g and the large measuring spoon 8.@@ 6 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate .
if a patient has to receive the medication via a probe , AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS can also be dissolved in water before use ( the solu@@ bility of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate is up to 5 grams in 10 ml of water ) .
in patients with these rare diseases , certain liver enzymes are missing , so they cannot ex@@ crete the nit@@ ro@@ genous waste products which accumulate in the body after consuming proteins .
if you are using laboratory tests , you must tell the doctor that you are taking AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS , since sodium poly@@ phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yl can influence the results of certain laboratory tests .
if you are taking AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS with other medicines , please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you are using other medicines or have recently taken it , even if it is not prescription medicine .
during breast@@ feeding , you may not use AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS as the medicine may pass into breast milk and harm your baby .

An@@ gi@@ ox is used to treat adult patients with acute cor@@ on@@ ary syndrome ( ACS , reduced blood supply to the heart ) , for example in unstable ang@@ ina ( a form of chest pain with different thickness ) or m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction ( heart attack ) ( an abnormal measurement value in the electro@@ cardi@@ ogram or EC@@ G ) .
if An@@ gi@@ ox is used to prevent blood cl@@ ots in patients who undergo a PCI , a higher dose is administered and the in@@ fusion can be continued up to four hours after the procedure .
this can help in patients with ang@@ ina or heart attack to maintain blood flow to the heart and increase the efficiency of a PCI .
approximately 14 000 patients participated in the main study on the treatment of ACS , in which the effect of An@@ gi@@ ox in general administration or in connection with a gly@@ cop@@ rot@@ ein II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or ( GP@@ I , another medicine for preventing blood cl@@ ots ) was compared with the conventional combination treatment with He@@ par@@ in ( another anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ an ) and a GP@@ I .
during the PCI , the patient frequently used a st@@ ent ( a short tube remaining in the ar@@ tery to prevent closure ) , and additionally received other medicines to prevent blood cl@@ ots such as ab@@ ci@@ xi@@ mab and aspir@@ in .
in the treatment of ACS was An@@ gi@@ ox - with or without a gift from GP@@ I - in preventing new events ( deaths , heart attacks or re@@ as@@ cul@@ ar@@ isation ) after 30 days or one year overall as effective as conventional treatment .
in patients undergoing a PCI , An@@ gi@@ ox was as effective in terms of all indicators as he@@ par@@ in , except for severe bleeding , in which it was significantly more effective than he@@ par@@ in .
An@@ gi@@ ox cannot be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to bi@@ vou@@ ru@@ dine , other hi@@ ru@@ dine or any of the other ingredients .
it may not be used in patients who recently had a bleeding , as well as in people with high blood pressure or severe kidney problems or heart infection .
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that An@@ gi@@ ox is an acceptable replacement for He@@ par@@ in during the treatment of ACS and during a PCI .
in September 2004 , the European Commission issued a permit to the company The Medic@@ ines Company UK Ltd for the placing of An@@ gi@@ ox in the entire European Union .
for the treatment of adult patients with acute cor@@ on@@ ary syndrome ( unstable ang@@ ina / non @-@ ST @-@ stroke inf@@ ar@@ ction ( IA / N@@ STE@@ MI ) ) in case of emergency intervention or early intervention .
the recommended starting dose of An@@ gi@@ ox in patients with ACS is an intraven@@ ous dosage of 0.1 mg / kg followed by an in@@ fusion of 0.@@ 25 mg / kg / h .
in the event that a PCI is operated in a further row , an additional bolt of 0.5 mg / kg should be given and the in@@ fusion for the duration of the intervention should be increased to 1.@@ 75 mg / kg / h .
according to the PCI , the reduced in@@ fusion dose of 0.@@ 25 mg / kg / h can be resum@@ ed for 4 to 12 hours following clinical requirements .
immediately before the procedure , a penalty of 0.5 mg / kg is to be administered , followed by an in@@ fusion of 1.@@ 75 mg / kg / h for the duration of the procedure .
the recommended dosage of An@@ gi@@ ox in patients with a PCI consists of an initial intraven@@ ous dosage of 0.@@ 75 mg / kg body weight and a subsequent intraven@@ ous intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion with a dose of 1.@@ 75 mg / kg body weight / h at least for the duration of the surgery .
the safety and effectiveness of an all @-@ in @-@ one Bol@@ us gift from An@@ gi@@ ox has not been examined and is not recommended even if a short PCI procedure is planned .
if this value ( ACT after 5 minutes ) is shortened to less than 225 seconds , a second bolt of 0.3 mg / kg / body weight should be carried out .
in order to reduce the occurrence of low ACT values , the re@@ constituted and dil@@ uted medicinal product should be carefully mixed before use and intraven@@ ously administered intraven@@ ously .
as soon as the ACT value is more than 225 seconds , further monitoring is no longer necessary , provided that the 1.@@ 75 mg / kg in@@ fusion dose is administered correctly .
in patients with moderate kidney function restriction ( G@@ FR 30 @-@ 59 ml / min ) , which are subjected to a PCI ( whether treated with a bi@@ vou@@ ru@@ din or not ) , a lower in@@ fusion rate of 1.4 mg / kg / h should be used .
if the ACT value is less than 225 seconds , a second bolt dose of 0.3 mg / kg is to be administered and the ACT 5 minutes after the second wrist dose to be checked again .
in patients with moderate kidney damage included in the phase II@@ I@@ - PCI trial ( RE@@ PLA@@ CE @-@ 2 ) , which led to approval , the ACT value was 5 minutes after the application of the bi@@ vou@@ ru@@ din cle@@ us without dose adjustment at an average of 3@@ 66 ± 89 seconds .
3 In patients with severe kidney damage ( G@@ FR &lt; 30 ml / min ) and also in di@@ aly@@ sis @-@ based patients , An@@ gi@@ ox is contra@@ indicated ( see section 4.3 ) .
the treatment with An@@ gi@@ ox can be initiated 30 minutes after the termination of the intraven@@ ous administration of un@@ frac@@ tional he@@ par@@ in or 8 hours after completion of sub@@ cut@@ aneous administration of low @-@ molecular he@@ par@@ in .
• well @-@ known hyper@@ sensitivity to the active agent or any other component or against hi@@ ru@@ dine • active bleeding or increased bleeding risk due to a distur@@ b@@ ance of the hem@@ o@@ sta@@ sis system and / or ir@@ reversible bacterial endo@@ cardi@@ tis . • severe kidney damage ( G@@ FR &lt; 30 ml / min ) and for di@@ aly@@ sis patients
patients are carefully monitored during the treatment with regard to symptoms and signs of bleeding , especially if bi@@ vou@@ ru@@ din is given in combination with another anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ an ( see Section 4.5 ) .
although most of the hem@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ ges in the case of PCI patients suffer most of the hem@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ ges in arter@@ ial points , in patients who undergo a perc@@ ut@@ aneous cor@@ on@@ ary intervention ( PCI ) , bleeding can generally occur everywhere .
in patients who are taking War@@ far@@ in and treated with bi@@ vou@@ ru@@ din , a monitoring of the IN@@ R value ( International Norm@@ alized R@@ atio ) should be considered to ensure that the value after sett@@ ling the treatment with bi@@ vou@@ ru@@ din again reaches the level before treatment .
based on the knowledge about the mode of action of anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants ( he@@ par@@ in , war@@ far@@ in , thro@@ mb@@ oly@@ tics or th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ te aggreg@@ ations ) it can be assumed that these agents increase the risk of bleeding .
in the combination of bi@@ vou@@ ru@@ ines with th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ te aggreg@@ ations or anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants , the clinical and biological hem@@ o@@ sta@@ sis parameters can be monitored regularly .
animal experiments are insufficient in relation to pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , child@@ birth or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) .
46@@ 12 were random@@ ised to bi@@ vou@@ ru@@ din alone , 4@@ 60@@ 4 were random@@ ised to bi@@ vou@@ ru@@ din plus GP@@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or and 4@@ 60@@ 3 were random@@ ized to either un@@ questioning he@@ par@@ in or E@@ no@@ x@@ apar@@ in plus GP@@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or .
both in the bi@@ vou@@ ru@@ din group as well as in comparison groups treated with he@@ par@@ in , women and patients over 65 years of age were more common in adverse events than in male or younger patients .
severe ble@@ ed@@ ings were defined according to AC@@ U@@ ITY and Tim@@ i standards for severe ble@@ ed@@ ings as in table 2 foot@@ notes .
both light and heavy ble@@ ed@@ ings were significantly less frequent under bi@@ vou@@ ru@@ din than in groups with he@@ par@@ in plus GP@@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or and bi@@ vou@@ dru@@ din plus GP@@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or ( see table 2 ) .
AC@@ U@@ ITY heavy bleeding was defined as one of the following events : in@@ trac@@ ran@@ ial , retro@@ per@@ it@@ one@@ al , intraocular bleeding or bleeding in the punc@@ ture area , ha@@ em@@ at@@ oma with a diameter ≥ 5 cm at the punc@@ ture point , reduction of ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in mirror of ≥ 3 g / dl with known bleeding centre , re@@ operation due to bleeding , application of blood products to trans@@ fusion .
further , less frequently observed bleeding @-@ loc@@ aliz@@ ations occurring in more than 0.1 % ( occasionally ) were &quot; other &quot; punc@@ tu@@ ation points , retro@@ per@@ it@@ one@@ al , gastro@@ intestinal , ear , nose or neck .
the following information about side effects are based on the data of a clinical study with bi@@ vou@@ ru@@ din in 6000 patients undergoing a PCI .
both in the Bi@@ vali@@ ant group as well as in comparison groups treated with he@@ par@@ in , women and patients over 65 years of age were more common in adverse events than in male or younger patients .
both light and heavy ble@@ ed@@ ings were significantly less frequent under bi@@ vou@@ ru@@ din than in the comparison group under He@@ par@@ in plus GP@@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or .
the following side effects , which are not listed above , were reported in practice after a comprehensive application and are group@@ ed according to system organ@@ classes in table 6 .
in case of over@@ dosage , the treatment with bi@@ vou@@ ru@@ din is immediately broken off and the patient is closely mes@@ h@@ ed with regard to signs of bleeding .
An@@ gi@@ ox contains bi@@ vou@@ ru@@ din , a direct and specific thro@@ mb@@ one inhibit@@ or , which bin@@ ds both the cataly@@ tic center and the animal bone region of th@@ rom@@ bo@@ in , regardless of whether th@@ rom@@ bo@@ sis is bound in the liquid phase or cl@@ ots .
binding of bi@@ vou@@ ru@@ din to th@@ rom@@ bo@@ in , and thus its effect , is reversible , because th@@ rom@@ bo@@ in is slowly spl@@ itting the bond of bi@@ vou@@ ru@@ din @-@ AR@@ G@@ 3 @-@ Pro@@ 4 , which re@@ generates the function of the active center of thro@@ mb@@ ine .
furthermore , a bi@@ vou@@ ru@@ din with serum from patients in which it had occurred in the past to he@@ par@@ in @-@ induced th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ top@@ en@@ ia / he@@ par@@ in@@ induced th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ top@@ en@@ ia / he@@ par@@ in @-@ induced th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ top@@ en@@ ia ( H@@ IT / H@@ IT@@ T@@ s ) did not indu@@ ce a th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ te formation reaction .
in healthy volunteers and in patients , bi@@ vou@@ ru@@ din shows a dose and concentration @-@ dependent anti @-@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ atory effect , which is substanti@@ ated by the extension of ACT , a@@ PT@@ T , PT , IN@@ R and TT .
if a PCI was performed in the following patients , an additional bolt of 0.@@ 5@@ mg / kg of bi@@ vou@@ ru@@ din should be given and the in@@ fusion for the duration of the intervention should be increased to 1.@@ 75@@ mg / kg / h .
in the Arm A of the AC@@ U@@ ITY study , un@@ frac@@ tion@@ ated he@@ par@@ in or e@@ no@@ x@@ apar@@ in was administered in accordance with the relevant guidelines for the treatment of acute cor@@ on@@ ary syndrome ( ACS ) in patients with unstable ang@@ ina / non @-@ ST @-@ lift attack ( IA / N@@ STE@@ MI ) .
patients in Arm A and B were also random@@ ized to obtain a GP@@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or either before beginning of angi@@ ography ( at the time of random@@ isation ) or in the PCI .
in the AC@@ U@@ ITY study , the characteristics of high @-@ risk patients , requiring an angi@@ ography within 72 hours , were evenly distributed over the 3 treatment arms .
about 77 % of patients had recurring isch@@ emia , 70 % had dynamic EK@@ G changes or increased cardiac biom@@ ark@@ ers , 28 % had diabetes and about 99 % of all patients underwent a angi@@ ography within 72 hours .

A@@ pi@@ dra is used for the treatment of adults , adolescents and children from six years with diabetes , which require treatment with insulin .
A@@ pi@@ dra is inj@@ ected sub@@ cut@@ aneous ( under the skin ) into the abdominal wall , the thi@@ ghs or upper arm , or administered as a permanent in@@ fusion with an insulin pump .
diabetes is a disease in which the body does not produce enough insulin to regulate glucose levels ( sugar ) in the blood or the insulin cannot be processed effectively .
insulin l@@ ul@@ is@@ in differs very margin@@ ally from human insulin , and the change means it acts faster and has a shorter duration than a short @-@ acting human@@ oid .
A@@ pi@@ dra has been studied in combination with a long @-@ acting insulin for patients with type 1 diabetes , in which the body can produce no insulin , in two studies with a total of 1,@@ 5@@ 49 adults and in a study with 5@@ 72 children aged between four and 17 years .
in the case of type 2 diabetes , in which the body is unable to work effectively , A@@ pi@@ dra was studied in a study of 8@@ 78 adults .
the main indicator of efficacy was the change in the concentration of the substance gly@@ cos@@ yl@@ ated hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in ( H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) in the blood that indicates how well the blood sugar is set .
in the first study involving adults with type 1 diabetes , a reduction of 0.@@ 14 % ( from 7.@@ 60 % to 7.@@ 46 % ) compared to a reduction of 0.@@ 14 % in insulin l@@ is@@ per was observed after six months .
in adults with type 2 diabetes , the reduction of H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c concentration was 0.@@ 46 % after six months with A@@ pi@@ dra compared to 0.@@ 30 % in human normal insulin .
A@@ pi@@ dra may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to insulin l@@ ul@@ is@@ in or any of the other ingredients , or in patients who are already suffering from hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia .
the doses of A@@ pi@@ dra may need to be adapted if it is administered together with a number of other medicines that can affect the blood glucose level .
in September 2004 , the European Commission issued a permit to the company San@@ of@@ i @-@ Av@@ entis Deutschland GmbH for the placing on the market of A@@ pi@@ dra in the entire European Union .
A@@ pi@@ dra can be applied as sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection either in the area of the abdominal wall , the th@@ igh or the delta muscle or sub@@ cut@@ aneous through continuous in@@ fusion in the area of the abdominal wall .
because of the reduced glucose availability and reduced insulin metabolism , insulin requirements in patients with a reduction in liver function can be reduced .
any change in the effective strength , the brand ( her@@ - ) , insulin type ( normal , N@@ PH , zinc ret@@ ar@@ ded , etc . ) , the type of insulin ( animal insulin ) and / or the manufacturing method can change the insulin requirement .
3 An insufficient dosage or abor@@ tion of treatment , especially in patients with insulin @-@ related diabetes , may lead to hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia and diabe@@ tic k@@ eto@@ aci@@ dosis ; these conditions are potentially life @-@ threatening .
the conversion of a patient to another type of insulin or an insulin produced by another manufacturer should be carried out under strict medical supervision and may necess@@ itate a change in dosage .
the time of occurrence of hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia depends on the action profile of the insulin used and can therefore change when changing the treatment scheme .
substances that increase blood sugar @-@ lowering activity and increase the tendency to hypo@@ gly@@ cem@@ ias include oral anti@@ diabe@@ tic , angi@@ ot@@ ens@@ in @-@ con@@ ver@@ ting enzyme ( ACE ) inhibit@@ ors , disp@@ op@@ y@@ ramid , fi@@ br@@ ate , flu@@ ox@@ et@@ ine , pent@@ oxi@@ f@@ y@@ ll@@ ine , pro@@ po@@ xy@@ ph@@ ene , sal@@ ic@@ yl@@ ates and sul@@ fon@@ amide antibiotics .
in addition , under the effect of sympath@@ oly@@ tics such as beta block@@ ers , c@@ lon@@ i@@ din , Gu@@ an@@ e@@ thi@@ dine and reser@@ pine , the symptoms of adren@@ ergi@@ c counter@@ regulation can be atten@@ u@@ ated or absent .
experimental studies on reproductive toxic@@ ity showed no differences between in@@ su@@ - ling@@ l@@ ul@@ is@@ in and human insulin in relation to pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , birth or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) .
it is not known whether insulin l@@ ul@@ is@@ in occurs in human breast milk , but generally insulin does not enter into breast milk , nor is it res@@ or@@ bed after oral application .
the following are listed in clinical trials known for adverse drug reactions , group@@ ed according to system organ classes and sorted according to decreasing frequency of occurrence ( very common : ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 100 ; rare : ≥ 1 / 10,000 , &lt; 1 / 1000 ; very rare : &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) ; not known ( frequency based on available data cannot be estimated ) .

li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy is missed to continuously change the injection site within the injection area , can result in a li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy at the injection site .
severe hypo@@ gly@@ cem@@ ias with un@@ consciousness can be treated by means of an intra@@ muscular or sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection of glucose ( 0.5 to 1 mg ) given by an appropriately trained person , or by intraven@@ ous glucose by a doctor .
after glu@@ eing , the patient should be monitored in a hospital to determine the primary cause of severe hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia and avoid similar episodes .
insulin reduces blood sugar levels by stimulating peripheral glucose intake ( especially through skel@@ etal muscles and fat ) as well as by inhibit@@ ing glucose production in the liver .
studies with healthy volunteers and patients with diabetes have shown that in the case of sub@@ cut@@ aneous GA@@ - of insulin l@@ ul@@ is@@ ines the effect occurs more quickly and the duration of time is shorter than with a normal insulin analog .
in a study of 18 male people aged 21 to 50 years with type 1 diabetes m@@ li@@ - tus , insulin l@@ ul@@ is@@ in showed a dose of proportional glu@@ cos@@ es@@ entative effect in the therapeutic relevant dosage range of 0,@@ 0@@ 75 to 0.@@ 15 E / kg , and at 0.3 E / kg or more a dispro@@ portion@@ ate increase in the glu@@ cos@@ es@@ thetic effect , just like the human insulin .
insulin l@@ ul@@ is@@ in has a twice as fast response as normal human insulin and achieves the complete glu@@ cos@@ es@@ entative effect about 2 hours earlier than human insulin .
from the data it was obvious that in an application of insulin l@@ ul@@ is@@ in 2 minutes before the meal , a comparable post @-@ fla@@ den@@ al gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic control is reached as with a human normal insulin which is given 30 minutes before the meal .
if insulin l@@ ul@@ is@@ sis was taken 2 minutes before the meal , a better post@@ den@@ ial control was achieved than with a human normal insulin which was given 2 minutes before the meal .
if insulin l@@ ul@@ is@@ eed is applied in 15 minutes after the start of the meal , a comparable gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic control is achieved as with a human regulator that is given 2 mi@@ ths before the meal ( see Figure 1 ) .
insulin l@@ ul@@ is@@ in for gift 2 minutes ( G@@ LU@@ L@@ IS@@ IN - previously ) before the start of the meal was given before the start of the meal ( Figure 1A ) as well as compared to human normal insulin which was given 2 minutes ( NOR@@ MA@@ L - before ) before a meal ( Figure 1@@ B ) .
insulin l@@ ul@@ is@@ in for 15 minutes ( G@@ LU@@ L@@ IS@@ IN - afterwards ) after the start of the meal compared to human nor@@ - mal@@ aria , which was given 2 minutes ( NOR@@ MA@@ L - before ) before the start of the meal ( Figure 1@@ C ) .
