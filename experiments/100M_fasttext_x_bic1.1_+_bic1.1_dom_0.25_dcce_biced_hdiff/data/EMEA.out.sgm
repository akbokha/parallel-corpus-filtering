<seg id="1">This document is a summary of the European Public Transport Report (EPAR), which explains how the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) has assessed the studies carried out to make recommendations regarding the use of the drug.</seg>
<seg id="2">If you need more information about your illness or treatment, please read the packaging template (also part of the EPAR) or contact your doctor or pharmacist.</seg>
<seg id="3">If you would like more information on the basis of the recommendations of the CHMP, please read the scientific discussion (also part of the EPAR).</seg>
<seg id="4">It is available as 5 mg, 10 mg, 15 mg and 30 mg tablets, as 10 mg, 15 mg and 30 mg of melting tablets (tablets that dissolve in the mouth), as a solution for intake (1 mg / ml) and as an injection solution (7.5 mg / ml).</seg>
<seg id="5">B. wiry thinking and speaking, hallucinations (hearing or seeing things that are not present), distrust and delusions; • Bipolar-I disturbance, an emotional condition in which the patients have alternate episodes of normal mood alternately with periods of normal mood.</seg>
<seg id="6">Abilify is used to treat moderate to severe manic episodes and to prevent manic episodes in patients who have addressed the medicine in the past.</seg>
<seg id="7">The injection solution is used for quick control of increased disturbance or behavioural disturbances when oral consumption of the drug is not possible.</seg>
<seg id="8">In both cases, the solution to take-in or the melting tablets can be applied in patients who have difficulty swallowing tablets.</seg>
<seg id="9">In patients who are taking other medicines at the same time as Abilify, the dosage of Abilify should be adjusted.</seg>
<seg id="10">This interferes with the signal transmission between brain cells by "neurotransmitters," i.e. chemical substances that enable the communication of nerve cells.</seg>
<seg id="11">Aripiprazole probably mainly acts as a "partial agonist" for the receptors for the neurotransmitters dopamine and 5-hydroxytryptamin (also called serotonin).</seg>
<seg id="12">This means that Aripiprazole, such as 5-hydroxytryptamin and dopamine, has a smaller degree than the neurotransmitter to activate the receptors.</seg>
<seg id="13">As dopamine and 5-hydroxytryptamin play a role in schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, Aripiprazole helps to normalize the activity of the brain, thereby reducing psychotic or manic symptoms and preventing their recurrence.</seg>
<seg id="14">The effectiveness of Abilify to prevent the recurrence of symptoms has been studied in three studies for up to one year.</seg>
<seg id="15">The effectiveness of the injection solution was compared to two studies in 805 patients with schizophrenia or similar disorders that were suffering from increased unrest over a period of two hours with a placebo.</seg>
<seg id="16">In another study, Abilify was compared to 347 patients with haloperidol, in another study the efficacy of Abilify and placebo to prevent recurrence in 160 patients in whom the manic symptoms had already been stabilized with Abilify.</seg>
<seg id="17">The efficacy of Abilify injection solution was compared in a study of 301 patients with bipolar disorder, suffering from increased unrest, with the treatment of Lorazepam (another antipsychotic medication) and placebo over a period of two hours.</seg>
<seg id="18">In all studies, the change in the patient's symptoms was investigated using a standard bipolar disorder or the number of patients who responded to the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="19">The company also conducted studies in order to investigate how the body absorbs the melting tablets and the solution for inhaling.</seg>
<seg id="20">Both studies with injection solution showed patients who received Abilify in doses of 5.25 mg, 9.75 mg or 15 mg, a significantly greater reduction in symptoms of increased anxiety than the patients receiving placebo.</seg>
<seg id="21">In the treatment of bipolar disorder, Abilify was more effective than placebo in four of the five short-term studies.</seg>
<seg id="22">In addition, Abilify prevented for up to 74 weeks more effective than placebo for the recurrence of manic episodes in previously treated patients and, if administered in addition to an existing treatment.</seg>
<seg id="23">Abilify injections in 10 or 15 mg doses were also more effective than placebo for the symptoms of increased unrest and were similar to Lorazepam.</seg>
<seg id="24">The most common side effects of Abilify (observed at 1 to 10 of 100 patients) are extrapyramidal disturbances (uncontrolled tick), depression, blurred vision, dyspepsia (distipation), fatigue and exhaustion, restlessness, insomnia (sleep disorders) and anxiety.</seg>
<seg id="25">The Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) concluded that the advantages of Abilify in the treatment of schizophrenia and of moderate to severe manic episodes in patients with mainly manic episodes and in which the manic episodes were related to treatment with Aripiprazole were outweighed against the risks.</seg>
<seg id="26">Moreover, the committee came to the conclusion that the benefits of injection solution in rapid control of increased disturbance and behavioural disorders in patients with schizophrenia or in patients with manic episodes in bipolar-I-disorder, if oral therapy is not suitable, outweigh the risks.</seg>
<seg id="27">In June 2004, the European Commission issued approval for the marketing of Abilify across the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="28">Abilify is indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe manic episodes of bipolar disorder and for the prevention of a new manic episode in patients who had mainly manic episodes and whose manic episodes were related to treatment with Aripiprazole (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="29">The recommended starting dose for Abilify is 10 or 15 mg / day at a maintenance dose of 15 mg / day daily regardless of meals.</seg>
<seg id="30">Increased efficacy in dosages over a daily dose of 15 mg was not proven although individual patients can benefit from a higher dose.</seg>
<seg id="31">The recommended starting dose for Abilify is 15 mg once a day, independent of meals as monotherapy or combination therapy (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="32">The efficacy of Abilify in the treatment of schizophrenia and bipolar disorder in patients ≥ 65 years has not been proven.</seg>
<seg id="33">In consideration of the greater sensitivity of this group of patients, a lower initial dose should be considered when clinical factors are justified (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="34">If the CYP3A4 Inductor is removed from the combination therapy, the Aripiprazl dose should be reduced to the recommended dose (see Section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="35">The occurrence of suicidal behavior belongs to psychotic diseases and affective disorders and was reported in some cases after onset or after change of an antipsychotic therapy, also in treatment with Aripiprazole (see Section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="36">Results of an epidemiological study showed that in patients with bipolar disorder there was no increased suicide risk with Aripiprazol compared to other antipsychotics.</seg>
<seg id="37">Aripiprazole should be used with care in patients with known cardiovascular disease (myocardial infarction or ischemic heart disease, heart failure, overcurrent disorders), cerebrovascular diseases, conditions that predispose for hypotonia (dehydration, hypovolaemia, treatment with blood pressure lowering drugs) or hypertension (including acocelerized and malignant form).</seg>
<seg id="38">3 Spätdyskinesia: in clinical studies that lasted a year or less, there were occasional reports of dyskinesia occurring during treatment with Aripiprazl.</seg>
<seg id="39">If signs and symptoms of a late dyskinesia are treated with Abilify, patients should be taken into consideration to reduce the dose or break down the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="40">If a patient develops signs and symptoms that suggest a MNS, or a clear high fever without an additional clinical manifestation of MNS, all antipsychotics, including Abilify, must be dismissed.</seg>
<seg id="41">Therefore, Aripiprazole should be used with caution in patients with seizures in the anamnesis or in conditions related to seizures.</seg>
<seg id="42">56 - 99 years with Aripiprazol in patients with psychosis associated with Alzheimer's disease had patients treated with Aripiprazole an increased risk of death compared to placebo.</seg>
<seg id="43">However, there was one of these studies, a study with fixed dosage, a significant relationship between dosage and response for undesirable cerebrovascular events in patients treated with Aripiprazole.</seg>
<seg id="44">Hyperglycemia, in some cases extremely and associated with ketoacidosis or hyperosmolar coma or death, was reported in patients treated with atypical anti-psychotic agents including Abilify.</seg>
<seg id="45">There are no exact risk assessments for hyperglycemia-related adverse events associated with Abilify and other atypical anti-psychotic agents to allow direct comparisons.</seg>
<seg id="46">Polydipsy, polyurie, polyphagia and weakness) are observed and patients with diabetes mellitus or with risk factors for diabetes mellitus should be monitored regularly in relation to a deterioration of glucose levels.</seg>
<seg id="47">Weight gain is generally observed in schizophrenic patients and in patients with bipolar disorder due to comorbidities, the use of antipsychotics, in which weight gain is known as a side effect or an unhealthy lifestyle and might lead to serious complications.</seg>
<seg id="48">Due to the primary effect of Aripiprazole on the central nervous system, caution is advised when Aripiprazole is used in combination with alcohol or other central effective drugs with overbearing side effects such as sedation (see Section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="49">The H2 antagonist famotidine, an gastric acid blocker, reduces the resorption of Aripiprazole, but this effect is considered clinically not relevant.</seg>
<seg id="50">In a clinical study with healthy volunteers, a highly effective CYP2D6 inhibitor (Chinidine) increased the AUC of Aripiprazole by 107% while the Cmax remained unchanged.</seg>
<seg id="51">It is expected that other highly effective inhibitors of CYP2D6, such as fluoxetine and paroxetine, have similar effects and therefore similar dosages should be made.</seg>
<seg id="52">In CYP2D6 'bad' (= "poor") metabolism, the joint application with highly effective inhibitors of CYP3A4 can result in higher plasma concentrations of Aripiprazole in comparison to CYP2D6 Extensive Metabolism.</seg>
<seg id="53">Considering the joint application of ketoconazole or other highly effective CYP3A4 inhibitors with Abilify, potential benefits should outweigh the potential risks for the patient.</seg>
<seg id="54">Other highly effective inhibitors of CYP3A4, such as Itraconazole and HIV protease inhibitors, are likely to have similar effects and therefore similar dose reductions should be made.</seg>
<seg id="55">After placing the CYP2D6 or 3A4 inhibitor, the dosage of Abilify should be raised to the dose height before the start of the accompanying therapy.</seg>
<seg id="56">Diltiazem or escitalopram) or CYP2D6 together with Abilify can be administered with a moderate increase in Aripiprazol- concentrations.</seg>
<seg id="57">In clinical trials, doses of 10-30 mg of Aripiprazole showed no significant effect on the metabolism of the mediums of CYP2D6 (dextrometorphan / 3-methoxymorphine Ratio), 2C19 (Omeprazol) and 3A4 (dextrometorphan).</seg>
<seg id="58">Patients should be advised to notify their doctor if they are pregnant or plan pregnant during treatment with Aripiprazole.</seg>
<seg id="59">Due to insufficient data security for human safety and the concerns raised in the reproductive studies during animal studies, this drug may not be used during pregnancy unless the potential benefits clearly justify the potential risk of fetus.</seg>
<seg id="60">However, as with other antipsychotics, patients should be warned of using dangerous machines, including motor vehicles, until they are certain that Aripiprazole has no negative influence on it.</seg>
<seg id="61">The following adverse events occurred more frequently (≥ 1 / 100) than placebo or were classified as possible medically relevant side effects (*):</seg>
<seg id="62">The frequency of the side effects listed below is defined according to the following criteria: frequent (&gt; 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 10); occasionally (&gt; 1 / 1,000, &lt; 1 / 100).</seg>
<seg id="63">Schizophrenia - In a controlled long-term study of 52 weeks, patients who were treated with Aripiprazole achieved a overall lower incidence (25.8%) of EPS including Parkinsonism, acathisie, Dystonia and Dyskinesia, compared to patients treated with haloperidol (57.3%).</seg>
<seg id="64">In a placebo-controlled long-term study over 26 weeks, the incidence of EPS was 19% in patients under Aripiprazl and 13.1% in patients under placebo.</seg>
<seg id="65">In another controlled long-term study over 26 weeks, the incidence of EPS 14.8% in patients treated with Aripiprazole was 15.1% in patients under Olanzine therapy.</seg>
<seg id="66">Manic episodes in bipolar-I-disorder - In a controlled trial over 12 weeks, the incidence of EPS 23.5% in patients under Aripiprazol- treatment and 53.3% in patients under half-surgery treatment.</seg>
<seg id="67">In another study over 12 weeks, the incidence of EPS was 26.6% in patients under Aripiprazl and 17.6% for those under lithium treatment.</seg>
<seg id="68">During the long-term maintenance phase over 26 weeks in a placebo-controlled trial, the incidence of EPS 18.2% for patients under Aripiprazol- Treatment and 15.7% for patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="69">A comparison between the patient groups under Aripiprazl and placebo in which potentially clinically significant changes of routinely controlled laboratory parameters did not result in medically significant differences.</seg>
<seg id="70">Enhancements of CPK (creatine phosphokinase), generally temporary and asymptomatic, were observed at 3.5% of patients treated with Aripiprazole, compared to 2.0% of patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="71">Side effects that may occur in connection with an antipsychotic therapy and whose incidence also relates to treatment with Aripiprazole include the malignant neuroleptic syndrome, late dyskinesia and seizures, undesirable cerebrovascular events and increased mortality in older dementia patients, hyperglycemia and diabetes mellitus (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="72">In clinical studies and since the launch, unintended or intentional acute overdoses with Aripiprazole were observed in adult patients with estimated doses of up to 1260 mg and without death sequence.</seg>
<seg id="73">There is no information about the efficacy of a hemodialysis in the treatment of an overdose with Aripiprazole; however, it is unlikely that hemodialysis is beneficial in the treatment of overdosage, as Aripiprazole has a high plasma protein binding.</seg>
<seg id="74">It is thought that the efficacy of Aripiprazole in schizophrenia and bipolar-I disorder is mediated via the combination of a partial agonistic effect on dopamine D2- and serotonin 5HT1a- receptors and an antagonistic effect on serotonin 5HT2a receptors.</seg>
<seg id="75">In vitro, Aripiprazole showed a high affinity for dopamine D2- and D3 receptor and serotonin 5HT1a and 5HT2a receptor as well as a moderate affinity for dopamine D4-, serotonin 5HT2c- and 5HT7-, to alpha-1-adrenergen and to histamine-H1receptors.</seg>
<seg id="76">In dosage of Aripiprazole in doses ranging from 0.5 to 30 mg once daily for 2 weeks to healthy subjects, positron emission tomography showed a dose-dependent reduction in binding of 11C Racloprid, a D2 / D3 receptor ligands, at Nucleus caudatus and at the putname.</seg>
<seg id="77">In three placebo-controlled short-term studies (4 to 6 weeks) to 1,228 schizophrenic patients with positive or negative symptoms, Aripiprazol showed a statistically significant improvement in the psychotic symptoms compared to placebo.</seg>
<seg id="78">In a haloperidol-controlled trial, 52 the proportion of respondents adhered to the study medication in week 52 was similar to both groups (Aripiprazl 77% and haloperidol 73%).</seg>
<seg id="79">Current values from measurement scales, which were defined as secondary study targets including PANSS and the Montgomery-Assumption Scale, showed significantly greater improvement than at haloperidol.</seg>
<seg id="80">In a placebo-controlled trial over 26 weeks of patients with chronic schizophrenia, Aripiprazole showed a significantly higher incidence rate, which was 34% in the Aripiprazol group and 57% placebo.</seg>
<seg id="81">In an Olanzapine controlled, multinational double blind study for schizophrenia over 26 weeks, which included 314 patients and in which the primary study target was' weight gain ', significantly fewer patients had a weight gain of at least 7% compared to the initial value (i.e. an increase of at least 5,6 kg with an average weight of ca.).</seg>
<seg id="82">In two placebo-controlled monotherapy studies with flexible dosage over 3 weeks with patients with a manic or mixed episode of bipolar I disorder, Aripiprazole showed a efficacy compared to placebo in reducing manic symptoms over 3 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="83">In a placebo-controlled monotherapy trial over 3 weeks with fixed dosage with patients with a manic or mixed episode of bipolar I disorder, Aripiprazol showed no superior efficacy compared to placebo.</seg>
<seg id="84">In two placebo and active-controlled monotherapy studies over 12 weeks in patients with a manic or mixed episode of a bipolar-I disorder, with or without psychotic characteristics, Aripiprazole showed a efficacy against placebo in week 3 and a maintenance effect comparable to that of lithium or haloperidol in week 12.</seg>
<seg id="85">In addition, Aripiprazole also showed a comparable share of patients with symptomatic remission of the mania in week 12, such as lithium or haloperidol.</seg>
<seg id="86">In a placebo-controlled trial over 6 weeks with patients with a manic or mixed episode of a bipolar-I disorder, with or without psychotic characteristics, which sometimes did not respond to lithium or valproat monotherapy in therapeutic serum mirrors, the accompanying therapy with Aripiprazol revealed a superior efficacy in reducing manic symptoms compared to monotherapy with lithium or valproat.</seg>
<seg id="87">10 In a placebo-controlled trial over 26 weeks followed by a long-term enlargement phase over 74 weeks in manic patients who had achieved remission with Aripiprazol during a stabilization phase before randomisation, Aripiprazole was superior to the prevention of a bipolar decline, predominantly in the prevention of a relapse into the mania.</seg>
<seg id="88">Based on in vitro studies, the enzymes CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 are responsible for the dehydration and hydroxyregulation of Aripiprazole; N dealkylamation is catalysed by CYP3A4.</seg>
<seg id="89">The mean period of Elimination is approximately 75 hours for Aripiprazole in extensive metabolites via CYP2D6 and at approximately 146 hours in 'poor' (= poor ") metabolites via CYP2D6.</seg>
<seg id="90">In Aripiprazole there are no differences in the pharmacokinetic between male and female healthy volunteers, as did pharmacokinetic study of schizophrenia patients with no gender-dependent effects.</seg>
<seg id="91">A specific evaluation of pharmacokinetics did not reveal any evidence of clinically significant differences regarding ethnic origin or the effect of smoking on the pharmacokinetics of Aripiprazole.</seg>
<seg id="92">The pharmacokinetic properties of Aripiprazole and Dehydro-Aripiprazole were similar in patients with severe kidney failure in comparison to young healthy subjects.</seg>
<seg id="93">A single dose trial in subjects with different liver cirrhosis (Child-Pugh class A, B and C) showed no significant effect regarding liver function on the pharmacokinetics of Aripiprazole and Dehydro-Aripiprazole, but the study included only 3 patients with cirrhosis of the class C, which is not enough to draw conclusions about their metabolic capacity.</seg>
<seg id="94">Based on conventional studies on safety harmacology, toxicity in repeated administration, reproductive toxicity, genotoxicity and carcinogenic potential, pre-clinical data did not reveal any particular dangers to humans.</seg>
<seg id="95">Toxicologically significant effects were observed only in dosages or expositions that clearly exceeded the maximum dose or exposure in humans, so they have limited or no meaning for clinical use.</seg>
<seg id="96">The effects covered a dose-dependent adrenal-toxicity (Lipofuscin-pigment-accumulation and / or parenchyma cell loss) in rats after 104 weeks at the recommended maximum dose in humans) and an increase of adrenal-adrenal-carcinomas and combined adrenal-adrenal-adenomas (AUC) in female rats at the recommended maximum dose in humans).</seg>
<seg id="97">In addition, a cholelithiasis was detected as a result of the purification of sulfate conjugates of the Aripiprazole in the Galle of apes after repeated oral administration of 25 to 125 mg / kg / day (1 to 3 times the recommended maximum dose in humans based on mg / m2).</seg>
<seg id="98">However, the concentrations of sulphate conjugates of hydroxy- Aripiprazole found at the highest recommended daily dose of 30 mg were no more than 6% of the concentrations found in the Galle in monkeys and are far below limit values (6%) in vitro solubility.</seg>
<seg id="99">In rabbits, these effects were observed after dosages, which led to exposures of the 3 and 11 times the middle steady state AUC at the recommended clinical maximum dose.</seg>

<seg id="145">In order to increase the resorption and minimize variability, an injection is recommended in the M. deltoideus or deep into the gluteus-maximus muscle while recovering adipous regions.</seg>
<seg id="146">A lower dose of 5.25 mg (0.7 ml) may be given depending on the individual clinical status given to the medicines used for maintenance or acute therapy (see Section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="147">If a secondary oral treatment is indicated with Aripiprazole, see the summary of the characteristics of the medication to Abilify tablets, Abilify melting tablets or abilify solution.</seg>
<seg id="148">There are no studies on the efficacy of Aripiprazole injection solution in patients with agitibility and behavioural disorders caused by schizophrenia and manic episodes of bipolar-I disorder.</seg>
<seg id="149">If parenteral therapy with benzodiazepines is considered necessary in addition to the Aripiprazole injection solution, patients should be observed with respect to extreme sedation or blood pressure drop (see Section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="150">Tests on the safety and efficacy of Aripiprazole injection solution are not available for patients with alcohol or drug poisoning (prescribed by prescribed or illegal drugs).</seg>
<seg id="151">Aripiprazole should be used with care in patients with known cardiovascular disease (myocardial infarction or ischemic heart disease, heart failure, overcurrent disorders), cerebrovascular diseases, conditions that predispose for hypotonia (dehydration, hypovolaemia, treatment with blood pressure lowering drugs) or hypertension (including acocelerized and malignant form).</seg>
<seg id="152">Late dyskinesia: in clinical studies that lasted a year or less, there were occasional reports of dyskinesia occurring during treatment with Aripiprazl.</seg>
<seg id="153">Clinical manifestations of a MNS are high fever, muscle stiffness, changing levels of consciousness and signs of autonomous instability (irregular pulse or blood pressure, tachycardia, sweating and cardiac arrhythmia).</seg>
<seg id="154">Polydipsy, polyurie, polyphagia and weakness) are observed and patients with diabetes mellitus or with risk factors for diabetes mellitus should be monitored regularly in relation to a deterioration of glucose levels.</seg>
<seg id="155">Weight gain is generally observed in schizophrenic patients and patients with bipolar mania due to comorbidities, the use of antipsychotics, in which weight gain is known as a side effect or an unhealthy lifestyle and might lead to serious complications.</seg>
<seg id="156">Nevertheless, the intensity of the sedation was greater compared to the one given by Aripiprazol, in a study where healthy subjects were administered intramuscular as one-time indication and who received at the same time Lorazepam (2 mg dose) intramuscular.</seg>
<seg id="157">105 The H2 antagonist famotidine, a gastric acid blocker, reduces the resorption of Aripiprazole, but this effect is considered clinically not relevant.</seg>
<seg id="158">CYP2D6 'bad' (= "poor") metabolisers can result in a joint application with highly effective inhibitors of CYP3A4 in higher plasma concentrations of Aripiprazole.</seg>
<seg id="159">Other highly effective inhibitors of CYP3A4, such as Itraconazole and HIV- protease inhibitors, are likely to have similar effects and therefore similar dosages should be made.</seg>
<seg id="160">After placing the CYP2D6 or 3A4 inhibitor, the dosage of Abilify should be raised to the dose height before the start of the accompanying therapy.</seg>
<seg id="161">106 Lorazepam (2 mg dose) intramuscular received, the intensity of the sedation was greater compared to that of alluvial administration of Aripiprazole.</seg>
<seg id="162">The following adverse events occurred more frequently in clinical trials with Aripiprazl injection solution (≥ 1 / 100) than placebo or were classified as possible medically relevant side effects (see Section 5.1):</seg>
<seg id="163">The frequency of the side effects listed below is defined according to the following criteria: frequent (≥ 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 10); occasionally (≥ 1 / 1,000, &lt; 1 / 100).</seg>
<seg id="164">The following adverse events occurred more frequently (≥ 1 / 100) than placebo or were classified as medically relevant side effects (*) in clinical trials (see Section 5.1):</seg>
<seg id="165">In a placebo-controlled long-term study over 26 weeks, the incidence of EPS was 19% in patients under Aripiprazol- treatment and 13.1% in patients under placebo.</seg>
<seg id="166">In another study over 12 weeks, the incidence of EPS was 26.6% in patients under Aripiprazol- treatment and 17.6% for those under lithium treatment.</seg>
<seg id="167">During the long-term maintenance phase over 26 weeks in a placebo-controlled trial, the incidence of EPS 18.2% for patients under Aripiprazl was treated and 15.7% for patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="168">A comparison between the patient groups under Aripiprazl and placebo in which potentially clinically significant changes of routinely controlled laboratory parameters did not result in medically significant differences.</seg>
<seg id="169">Enhancements of CPK (creatinphosphokinase), generally temporary and asymptomatic, were observed at 3.5% of patients treated with Aripiprazole, compared to 2.0% of patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="170">Side effects that may occur in connection with an antipsychotic therapy and whose incidence also relates to treatment with Aripiprazole include the malignant neuroleptic syndrome, late dyskinesia and seizures, undesirable cerebrovascular events and increased mortality in older dementia patients, hyperglycemia and diabetes mellitus (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="171">110 and behavioural disorders were the Aripiprazl injection solution combined with statistically significant enhancements of agitibility / behavioural disorders compared to placebo and was similar to haloperidol.</seg>
<seg id="172">In a placebo-controlled short-term study (24 h) with 291 patients with bipolar disorder as well as agitibility and behavioural disorders, the Aripiprazl injection solution was associated with a statistically significant improvement in the symptoms of agitibility and behavioural disorders compared to placebo and similar to the Lorazepam- reference poor.</seg>
<seg id="173">The observed average improvement from baseline to the PANSS Excitement Component score for the primary 2-hour endpoint was 5,8 for placebo, 9.6 for Lorazepam and 8.7 for Aripiprazole.</seg>
<seg id="174">In analyses of subgroups in patients with mixed episodes or patients with severe atoxicity, a similar efficacy was observed in relation to the overall population, but a statistical significance could be determined on the basis of a reduced number of patients.</seg>
<seg id="175">In three placebo-controlled short-term studies (4 to 6 weeks) to 1,228 schizophrenic patients with positive or negative symptoms, Aripiprazol (oral) showed a statistically significant improvement in the psychotic symptoms compared to placebo.</seg>
<seg id="176">In a haloperidol-controlled trial, 52 the proportion of respondents adhered to the study medication in week 52 was similar to both groups (Aripiprazl 77% (oral) and haloperidol 73%).</seg>
<seg id="177">Current values from measurement scales, which were defined as secondary study targets including PANSS and the Montgomery-Asberg Method of Depressions, showed a significantly greater improvement than at Haloperidol.</seg>
<seg id="178">In a placebo-controlled trial over 26 weeks of patients with chronic schizophrenia, Aripiprazole (oral) showed significantly higher incidence of relapse, which was 34% in the Aripiprazolar (oral) group and 57% placebo.</seg>
<seg id="179">In an Olanzapine controlled, multinational double blind study for schizophrenia over 26 weeks, which included 314 patients and in which the primary study target was' weight gain ', significantly fewer patients had a weight gain of at least 7% compared to the initial value (i.e. an increase of at least 5,6 kg with an average weight of ca.).</seg>
<seg id="180">111 In a placebo-controlled study for 6 weeks with a manic or mixed episode of a bipolar-I disorder, with or without psychotic characteristics, which sometimes did not respond to lithium or valproat monotherapy in therapeutic serum mirrors, the adjuvant therapy with Aripiprazol revealed a superior efficacy in reducing manic symptoms compared to monotherapy with lithium or valproat.</seg>
<seg id="181">In a placebo-controlled trial over 26 weeks followed by a 74-week study extension for manic patients who had achieved remission with Aripiprazol during a stabilization phase before randomisation, Aripiprazol was superior to the prevention of a bipolar decline, predominantly in the prevention of a return to the mania.</seg>
<seg id="182">The Aripiprazole AUC is 90% larger in the first 2 hours after intramuscular injection after administration of the same dose as tablet; systemic exposure was similar between the two formulations.</seg>
<seg id="183">In 2 studies with healthy volunteers the average time was to reach the maximum plasma level at 1 to 3 hours after application.</seg>
<seg id="184">The gift of Aripiprazole injection solution was well tolerated by rats and monkeys and resulted in no direct toxicity of a target organ after repeated application in systemic exposure (AUC), which was 15- or 5 times over the maximum humanistic exposure of 30 mg intramuscular.</seg>
<seg id="185">In studies for reproductive toxicity after IV application, no safety-relevant concerns after maternal exposure to 15- (rats) and 29 times (rabbits) were above the maximum humanistic exposure of 30 mg.</seg>
<seg id="186">Based on conventional studies with Aripiprazole (oral) for safety harmacology, toxicity in repeated administration, reproductive toxicity, genotoxicity and carcinogenic potential, pre-clinical data did not reveal any particular dangers to humans.</seg>
<seg id="187">Toxicologically significant effects were observed only in dosages or expositions, which significantly exceeded the maximum dosage or exposure to humans; therefore, they have limited or no meaning for clinical use.</seg>
<seg id="188">The effects covered a dose-dependent adrenal-toxicity (Lipofuscin-pigment-accumulation and / or parenchyma cell loss) in rats after 104 weeks at the recommended maximum dose in humans) and an increase of adrenal cortex-carcinomas and combined adrenal-glands in female rats at 60 mg / kg / day (that is 10 times the average steady-state exposure (AUC) at the recommended maximum dose in humans).</seg>
<seg id="189">In addition, a cholelithiasis was detected as a result of the purification of sulfate conjugates of the Aripiprazole in the Galle of apes after repeated oral administration of 25 to 125 mg / kg / day (1 to 3 times the recommended maximum dose in humans based on mg / m2).</seg>
<seg id="190">In rabbits, these effects were observed after dosages, which led to expositions of the 3- and 11-fold middle steady-state AUC at the recommended clinical maximum dose.</seg>

<seg id="267">The efficacy of Abraxane was investigated in a major study involving 460 women with metastatic breast cancer, of which about three-quarters used to receive an anthracycline.</seg>
<seg id="268">The effect of Abraxane (in general or as monotherapy) was compared with the medication containing a conventional paclitaxel (given in combination with other medicines to reduce side effects).</seg>
<seg id="269">In the main study 72 (31%) of 229 patients treated with Abraxane were treated to the treatment, compared to 37 (16%) of 225 patients receiving conventional paclitaxel.</seg>
<seg id="270">If only the patients treated for metastatic breast cancer were treated for the first time, there was no difference in the effectiveness indicators such as time to worsening of disease and survival.</seg>
<seg id="271">On the other hand, patients who had previously received other treatment for their metastatic breast cancer showed that Abraxane was more effective than conventional paclitaxel.</seg>
<seg id="272">It may also not be used in patients who have low neutrophils in the blood before or before the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="273">The Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) found that Abraxane was more effective than conventional paclitaxel and that it did not have to be given with other medicines compared to other paclitaxel medicines to reduce side effects.</seg>
<seg id="274">In January 2008, the European Commission granted the company Abraxis BioScience Limited a permit for the transport of Abraxane in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="275">Abraxane-monotherapy is indicated for the treatment of metastatic breast cancer in people in whom the first-line treatment for metastatic disease has failed and for which a standard anthracycline-containing treatment is not indicated (see also section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="276">In patients with severe neutropenia (neutrophinum number &lt; 0,50 x 109 / l over a period of one week or longer) or severe sensory neuropathy, the dose should be reduced to 220 mg / m2 in subsequent series.</seg>
<seg id="277">For sensory neuropathy grade 3, the treatment should be interrupted until improvement is reached on degree 1 or 2, and in all subsequent cycles, the dose must be reduced.</seg>
<seg id="278">There are currently no adequate data for the recommendation of dosage adjustments in patients with mild to moderate liver function (see Section 4.4. and 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="279">No studies were carried out with patients with impaired kidney function and there are currently no adequate data for the recommendation of dose adaptation in patients with impairment of the kidney function (see Section 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="280">Abraxane is not recommended for use in children under 18 years of age due to insufficient data on safety and effectiveness.</seg>
<seg id="281">Abraxane is an albumin-bound nanoparticle formulation of paclitaxel, which could have much other pharmacological characteristics than other formulations of paclitaxel (see Section 5.1 and 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="282">If an allergic reaction occurs, the medicine should be removed immediately and a symptomatic treatment should be initiated, and the patient may not be treated with paclitaxel again.</seg>
<seg id="283">In the patients no further Abraxane treatment cycles should be initiated until the neutrophrophic number has risen again to &gt; 1.5 x 109 / l and the thrombocyte number has risen again to &gt; 100 x 109 / l.</seg>
<seg id="284">Patients with severe liver dysfunctions (bilirubin &gt; 5 x ULN or ASL / ALT &gt; 10 x ULN) should not be treated with Abraxane.</seg>
<seg id="285">While a clearly associated cardiotoxicity was not proven in connection with Abraxane, cardiac cases in the indicated patient population are not unusual, especially in patients with previous anthracycline treatment or underlying heart or lung disease.</seg>
<seg id="286">In the case of nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea in patients after the application of Abraxane, they can be treated with the usual antiemetic and constipating means.</seg>
<seg id="287">Abraxane should not be used in pregnant women or in childbearing age, which do not practice effective contraception, unless the treatment of the mother with paclitaxel is unavoidable.</seg>
<seg id="288">Women in childbearing age should use a reliable contraceptive method during and up to 1 month after the treatment with Abraxane.</seg>
<seg id="289">Male patients treated with Abraxane are advised to bear no child during and up to six months after the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="290">Male patients should be advised prior to the treatment, because the therapy with Abraxane is the possibility of irreversible infertility.</seg>
<seg id="291">Abraxane can cause side effects such as fatigue (very common) and dizziness (often), which can affect the perspiration and ability to operate machines.</seg>
<seg id="292">Listed below are the most common and important events of side effects that occurred in 229 patients with metastatic breast cancer who were treated once every three weeks with 260 mg / m2 of Abraxane in the pivotal phase III trial.</seg>
<seg id="293">Neutropenia was the most conspicuous important hematological toxicity (reported in 79% of patients) and was quickly reversible and dose-dependent; leukopenia was reported to 71% of patients.</seg>
<seg id="294">Anemia (Hb &lt; 10 g / dl) was observed in 46% of patients treated with Abraxane and was severe in three cases (Hb &lt; 8 g / dl).</seg>
<seg id="295">Table 1 contains the side effects that have occurred in combination with the dosage of Abraxane as monotherapy at any dose and indication in studies (N = 789).</seg>
<seg id="296">Very common (≥ 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 10); occasionally (≥ 1 / 1000, &lt; 1 / 100); rarely (≥ 1 / 10,000, &lt; 1 / 1,000); very rare (&lt; 1 / 10).</seg>
<seg id="297">Occasionally, elevated blood pressure, weight gain, increased lactic hydrogenase in the blood, increased creatine in the blood, increased blood sugar, increased phosphorus in the blood, reduced potassium in the blood of heart disease:</seg>
<seg id="298">Dysphagia, bloating, tongue burn, dry mouth, pain of gums, loose stool, oesophagitis, pain in the lower abdomen, ulcers in the mouth, oral pain, rectal bleeding diseases of the kidneys and urinary tract:</seg>
<seg id="299">Pain in the chest wall, weakness of muscles, neck pain, abdominal pain, muscle spasms, pain in skeletal muscles, fain pain, discomfort in the limbs, muscle weakness Very common:</seg>
<seg id="300">Restlessness 1 The frequency of hypersensitivity reactions is calculated based on a definitive in relation to a population of 789 patients</seg>
<seg id="301">Since these events were reported on a voluntary basis during clinical practice, no estimates of the actual incidence are possible and no causal connection with these events was established.</seg>
<seg id="302">Paclitaxel is a stimuli-stimuli substance that promotes the accumulation of microtubules from the tubules and stabilizes microtubules by inhibiting their depolymerisation.</seg>
<seg id="303">This stabilization leads to inhibition of the normal dynamic reorganisation of the microtubular network, which is essential for the vital interphase and the mitotic cell functions.</seg>
<seg id="304">It is known that albumin conveys the transittosis of plasma components into the endothelial cells and in vitro studies it has been proven that the presence of albumin supports the transport of paclitaxel through the endothelial cells.</seg>
<seg id="305">It is assumed that this improved transendothelial transport is mediated by the gp-60-albumreceptor and a paclitaxel accumulation in the area of the tumor occurs due to the albumbining protein SPARC (secreted protein acidic rich in cysteine).</seg>
<seg id="306">The application of Abraxane for metastatic breast cancer is supported by data from 106 patients in two single-arm unblinded studies and 454 patients treated in a randomized phase III comparative study.</seg>
<seg id="307">In a study, 43 patients with metastatic breast carcinoma were treated with Abraxane, which was given in the form of an infusion for 30 minutes with a dose of 175 mg / m2.</seg>
<seg id="308">In the second study, a dose of 300 mg / m2 was used as infusion for 30 minutes to 63 patients with metastatic breast cancer.</seg>
<seg id="309">This multicenter study was performed in patients with metastatic breast cancer who received treatment with paclitaxel every 3 weeks either in the form of solvent containing Paclitaxel 175 mg / m2 as 3-hour infusion with premedication to prevent allergic reaction (N = 225) or in the form of Abraxane 260 mg / m2 as 30-minute infusion without premedication (N = 229).</seg>
<seg id="310">In the study 64% of patients had an impaired general condition (ECOG 1 or 2), 79% had visceral metastases and 76% had more than 3 metastasis.</seg>
<seg id="311">14% of patients had not received chemotherapy before, 27% had only one adjuvant chemotherapy, 40% only because of metastasis and 19% due to metastasis and adjuvant treatment.</seg>
<seg id="312">9 The results for the general response rate and time to progression of the disease as well as progression-free survival and survival for patients receiving &gt; First Line therapy are presented below.</seg>
<seg id="313">Neurotoxicity compared to paclitaxel was evaluated by the improvement of a degree for patients who experienced a peripheral neuropathy grade 3 at a time during therapy.</seg>
<seg id="314">The natural course of peripheral neuropathy for abatement at baseline due to the cumulative toxicity of Abraxane after &gt; 6 treatment courses was not evaluated and remains unknown.</seg>
<seg id="315">The pharmacokinetics of the total paclitaxel after 30- and 180-minute infusions of Abraxane with a dose of 80 to 375 mg / m2 were determined in clinical trials.</seg>
<seg id="316">The exposure to active substance (AUC) increased linearly from 2653 to 16736 ng.h / ml analogously to a dose of 80 to 300 mg / m2.</seg>
<seg id="317">10 After the intravenous administration of Abraxane in patients with metastatic breast carcinoma at the recommended clinical dose of 260 mg / m2, the Paclitaxel plasma concentration decreased in a multiphase manner.</seg>
<seg id="318">The average distribution volume was 632 l / m2; the high distribution volume indicates far-reaching extravascular distribution and / or soft tissue connection from paclitaxel.</seg>
<seg id="319">In a study with advanced solid tumours the pharmacokinetic properties of Paclitaxel were compared with an intravenous 30-minute infusion of 260 mg / m2 of Abraxane with the values after a 3 hour injection of 175 mg / m2 of solvent containing paclitaxel.</seg>
<seg id="320">After the Abraxane administration, the Clearance of Paclitaxel was higher (43%) than after a solvent containing paclitaxel injection, and the distribution volume was higher (53%) at Abraxane.</seg>
<seg id="321">In the published literature on in-vitro studies of human liver microsome and tissue layers, it is reported that Paclitaxel is metabolized primarily to 6α -hydroxypaclitaxel and to two smaller metabolites (3 "-p-hydroxypaclitaxel and 6α -3" -p-Dihydroxypaclitaxel).</seg>
<seg id="322">After a 30-minute infusion of 260 mg / m2 of Abraxane in patients with metastatic breast carcinoma, the mean value for cumulative urinary excretion of the unchanged ingredient was 4% of the given total dose of 6α -hydroxypaclitaxel and 3 "-p hydroxypaclitaxel, which indicates far-reaching non-renal clearance.</seg>
<seg id="323">Only a few data are available for patients at the age of more than 75 years, since only 3 patients of this age group participated in pharmacokinetic analysis.</seg>
<seg id="324">The chemical and physical stability was detected at 2 ° C - 8 ° C in original box and protected from light light over 8 hours.</seg>

<seg id="359">This means that streamed is similar to a biological medicine approved in the European Union (EU) and contains the same active substance (also called "reference drug").</seg>
<seg id="360">It is used in patients with normal blood glucose levels, where blood transfusion is not possible in connection with blood transfusion, and a blood loss of 900 to 1 800 ml can be expected.</seg>
<seg id="361">The treatment with streamed must be initiated under the supervision of a physician who has experience in the treatment of patients with diseases for which the medicine is indicated.</seg>
<seg id="362">In patients with kidney problems and in patients who want to make a blood donation, Abseamed is injected into a vein.</seg>
<seg id="363">The injection can also be carried out by the patient or his supervisor, provided that they have received appropriate guidance.</seg>
<seg id="364">In patients with chronic renal insufficiency or in patients receiving chemotherapy, the hemoglobin values should always be in the recommended range (between 10 and 12 grams per deciliter in adults or between 9.5 and 11 g / dl in children).</seg>
<seg id="365">The iron values of all patients are to be checked before treatment to ensure that there is no iron deficiency, and iron supplements should be administered throughout the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="366">In patients receiving chemotherapy, or in patients with kidney problems, anaemia can be caused by an erythropoietal defect or by the fact that the body does not adequately address the body's erythropoietin.</seg>
<seg id="367">Erythropoietin is also used before surgery to increase the number of red blood cells and to decrease the consequences of blood loss.</seg>
<seg id="368">It is produced by a cell in which a gene (DNA) was introduced that enables it to form epoetin alfa.</seg>
<seg id="369">Streamed was compared with the reference medicinal product when injected into a vein as part of a main study involving 479 patients suffering from kidney problems caused by kidney problems.</seg>
<seg id="370">All patients participating in this study had been injected into a vein for at least eight weeks before they were either converted to seamed or continued to receive Eprex / Erypo.</seg>
<seg id="371">The main indicator of efficacy was the change in haemoglobin values between the beginning of the study and the assessment period in weeks 25 to 29.</seg>
<seg id="372">The company also presented the results of a study in which the effects of streamed from under the skin were studied with those of Eprex / Erypo in 114 cancer patients receiving chemotherapy.</seg>
<seg id="373">In the study with patients suffering from anaemia caused by kidney problems, the haemoglobin values of patients who were converted to seamed were in the same measure as those patients who continued to receive Eprex / Erypo.</seg>
<seg id="374">In comparison, the patients who continued to receive Eprex / Erypo showed an increase of 0,063 g / dl of the initial value of 12.0 g / dl.</seg>
<seg id="375">The most common side effect of abseamed is an increase in blood pressure, which can occasionally lead to symptoms of encephalopathy (brain problems) such as sudden, piercing migraine headaches and confusion.</seg>
<seg id="376">Streamed may not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to epoetin alfa or any of the other ingredients.</seg>
<seg id="377">Streamed as injections under the skin is not recommended for the treatment of kidney problems as further studies are required to ensure that this does not trigger allergic reactions.</seg>
<seg id="378">The Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) concluded that for Abseamed in accordance with the regulations of the European Union, evidence has been provided that the medicine has a comparable quality, safety and efficacy profile such as Eprex / Erypo.</seg>
<seg id="379">The company that produces streamed will provide information packages for medical professionals in all Member States, including information on the safety of the drug.</seg>

<seg id="381">Treatment of anaemia and reduction of transfusion demand in adults with solid tumours, malignant lymphomas or multiple myeloma, which receive chemotherapy and in which the risk of transfusion is due to the general condition (such as cardiovascular condition, pre-existing anaemia at the beginning of chemotherapy).</seg>
<seg id="382">Treatment should only be performed in patients with moderate anaemia (haemoglobin [hb] 10 - 13 g / dl [6,2 - 8,1 mmol / l], if bleeding-saving measures are not available or insufficient, in case of planned larger surgical procedures requiring a large volume of blood (4 or more units blood for women; 5 or more units blood in men).</seg>

<seg id="385">The hemoglobin target concentration is between 10 and 12 g / dl (6.2 - 7.5 mmol / l) except for pediatric patients where the hemoglobin concentration should lie between 9,5 and 11 g / dl (5.9 - 6.8 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="386">Symptoms and symptoms can vary depending on age, gender and overall disease; therefore, the physician's assessment of the individual clinical course and condition of the disease is necessary.</seg>
<seg id="387">An increase in haemoglobin by more than 2 g / dl (1.25 mmol / l) over a period of four weeks should be avoided.</seg>
<seg id="388">Due to the variability between patients, individual hemoglobin values can occasionally be observed in a patient above or below the hemoglobin target concentration.</seg>
<seg id="389">In view of this hemoglobin variability, a corresponding dose management should be tried to achieve the hemoglobin target concentration of 10 g / dl (6.2 mmol / l) to 12 g / dl (7.5 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="390">If the haemoglobin value increases by more than 2 g / dl (1.25 mmol / l) per month or if the permanent hemoglobin value exceeds 12 g / dl (7.5 mmol / l), the epoetin alfa dose can be reduced by 25%.</seg>
<seg id="391">Patients should be closely monitored to ensure that epoetin alfa is applied in the lowest permitted dose needed to control anaemia and anemia.</seg>
<seg id="392">These clinical results indicate that patients with very low Hb value (&lt; 6 g / dl or &lt; 3,75 mmol / l) may require higher maintenance doses than patients where initial anaemia is less pronounced (Hb &gt; 8 g / dl or &gt; 5 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="393">These clinical results indicate that patients with very low Hb value (&lt; 6.8 g / dl or &lt; 4.25 mmol / l) may require higher maintenance doses than patients where initial anaemia is less difficult (Hb &gt; 6,8 g / dl or &gt; 4.25 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="394">Starting dose 50 I.U. / kg three times a week with intravenous application, if necessary with a dose increase of 25 I.U. / kg (three times a week) until the desired target value is reached (this should be done in steps of at least 4 weeks).</seg>
<seg id="395">Symptoms of anaemia and sequelae may vary depending on age, gender and overall disease; therefore, the assessment of the individual clinical course and condition of the disease is required by the physician.</seg>
<seg id="396">In view of this hemoglobin variability, a corresponding dose management should be tried to achieve the hemoglobin target concentration of 10 g / dl (6.2 mmol / l) to 12 g / dl (7.5 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="397">Patients should be closely monitored to ensure that epoetin alfa is applied in the lowest permitted dose required for control of anemic symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="398">If the haemoglobin value is increased by at least 1 g / dl (0.62 mmol / l) after 4 weeks of treatment, the dose of 150 I.U. / kg should be maintained three times a week or 450 I.U. / kg once a week.</seg>
<seg id="399">If the increase in haemoglobin &lt; 1 g / dl (&lt; 0.62 mmol / l) and the multicyte figure of &lt; 40,000 cells / µl is increased compared to the initial value, the dose should be increased to 300 I.U. / kg three times a week.</seg>
<seg id="400">If the haemoglobin value is increased by ≥ 1 g / dl (≥ 0.62 mmol / l) three times a week after further 4 weeks of treatment, the dose of 300 I.U. / kg should be maintained three times a week.</seg>
<seg id="401">If the haemoglobin value is increased by &lt; 1 g / dl (&lt; 0.62 mmol / l) or the Retikulocyte number by &lt; 40,000 cells / µl compared to the initial value, a response to the epoetin alfa therapy is unlikely and the treatment should be stopped.</seg>
<seg id="402">Patients with slight anaemia (haematocrit 33 - 39%), where the precautionary storage of ≥ 4 blood vessels is necessary, should be received twice weekly for 3 weeks before surgery.</seg>
<seg id="403">Iron substitution should start as early as possible - for example a few weeks before the start of the autologous blood donation program - to make large iron reserves available before the start of the streamed programme.</seg>
<seg id="404">6 The recommended dosage is 600 I.U. / kg Epetin alfa which should be given once a week for three weeks (day 21, 14 and 7) before surgery and on the day of surgery (day 0).</seg>
<seg id="405">Epoetin alfa preoperatively should be preoperatively 300 I.U. / kg each in 10 consecutive days, on the day of intervention and 4 days immediately afterwards.</seg>
<seg id="406">Alternatively, the injection at the end of dialysis can be given over the hose of a fistula needle, followed by 10 ml isotonic saline solution to rinse the hose and ensure sufficient injection of the medicine into the circulation.</seg>
<seg id="407">Patients suffering from erythroblastoopia (Pure Red Cell Aplasia, PRCA) should not receive an abseamed or other erythroblastoopia (see section 4.4 - erythroblastoopia).</seg>
<seg id="408">Heart attack or stroke within one month prior to treatment, unstable angina pectoris, increased risk of deep venous thromboses (e.g. anamnestic known venous thromboembolia).</seg>
<seg id="409">The use of epoetin alfa is contraindicated in patients who are not eligible for a major orthopaedic surgery: severe coronary heart disease, peripheral vascular disease, vascular disease of the carotides or cerebrovascular disease; in patients with recently occurred cardiac infarction or cerebrovascular event.</seg>
<seg id="410">Erythroblastoy (PRCA) Very rare was reported on the occurrence of an anti-body mediated PRCA after months of treatment with subcutaneous erythropoietin.</seg>
<seg id="411">In patients with sudden loss of time, defined as reduction of haemoglobin values (1 - 2 g / dl per month) with increased need for transfusions, the Retikulozyteness should be determined and the usual causes for non-response (iron, folic acid or vitamin B12 deficiency, aluminium luminous toxication, infections or inflammation, blood loss and haemolysis).</seg>
<seg id="412">If the Retikulocyte value, taking into account anaemia (i.e. the Retikulocytes "Index"), is degraded (&lt; 20.000 / mm3 or &lt; 20,000 / microliter or &lt; 0.5%), the thrombocyte and leukocyte numbers should be determined and an investigation of the bone marrow in the diagnosis of a PRCA should be considered.</seg>
<seg id="413">Data on immunogenicity in subcutaneous use of abseamed in patients with a risk for an anti-body-induced PRCA (patients with renal anemia) are not sufficient.</seg>
<seg id="414">8 In patients with chronic kidney failure, maintenance therapy should not exceed the upper limit for hemoglobin target concentration under Section 4.2.</seg>
<seg id="415">In clinical studies an increased risk of mortality and risk of serious cardiovascular events were observed when erythropoesis-stimulating agents (ESA) were given with a haemoglobin target concentration of more than 12 g / dl (7.5 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="416">Controlled clinical studies have shown no significant benefit to the use of epoetins if the haemoglobin concentration is increased by the concentration required to control anaemia and the prevention of blood transfusions.</seg>
<seg id="417">The increase in haemoglobin should be about 1 g / dl (0.62 mmol / l) per month and should not exceed 2 g / dl (1.25 mmol / l) per month to minimize the risk of high blood pressure.</seg>
<seg id="418">In patients with chronic kidney failure and clinically clear coronary heart disease or congestive heart failure, maintenance therapy should not exceed the upper limit for hemoglobin target concentration under Section 4.2.</seg>
<seg id="419">According to the present findings, the treatment of anaemia with epoetin alfa in adults with renal insufficiency, which are not yet dialysis, will not accelerate the progression of renal insufficiency.</seg>
<seg id="420">Tumour patients under chemotherapy should be considered a 2-3-week delay between epoetin-alfa and the erythropoetin response (patients who may need to be transfused).</seg>
<seg id="421">If the increase in Hb exceeds 2 g / dl (1.25 mmol / l) per month or a Hb value of 13 g / dl (8,1 mmol / l), the dose must be adapted according to section 4.2, in order to minimize the risk of possible thrombotic events (see section 4.2 Treatment of patients with chemotherapic anemia - dose adaptation with the aim of keeping the haemoglobin value between 10 g / dl and 12 g / dl).</seg>
<seg id="422">The decision for the use of recombinant erythropoetine should be based on a benefit-risk assessment involving the involvement of the respective patient, which should also take into account the specific clinical context.</seg>
<seg id="423">Patients who are foreseen for greater elective orthopaedic surgery should, if possible, examine the cause of anaemia before the beginning of epoetin-alfa therapy and be treated accordingly.</seg>
<seg id="424">Patients who undergo a larger elective orthopaedic surgery should receive adequate thromboseprophylaxis, as they have an increased risk of thrombotic and vascular diseases, especially in the case of underlying cardiovascular disease.</seg>
<seg id="425">In addition, it cannot be ruled out that for treatment with epoetin alfa for patients with an initial haemoglobin value of &gt; 13 g / dl an increased risk of post-operative / vascular events can exist.</seg>
<seg id="426">In several controlled trials, epoetins have not been proven to improve overall survival in tumour patients with symptomatic anaemia, or reduce the risk of tumour progression.</seg>
<seg id="427">4 months in patients with metastatic breast cancer receiving chemotherapy, when a hemoglobin target concentration of 12 - 14 g / dl (7.5 - 8,7 mmol / l) was targeted</seg>
<seg id="428">If epoetin alfa is used together with Ciclosporin, the blood levels of Ciclosporin should be controlled and the Ciclosporindosis should be adjusted to the increasing haematocrit.</seg>
<seg id="429">In vitro studies on tumor tissues, there is no evidence of an interaction between epoetin alfa and G-CSF or GM-CSF in hematological differentiation or proliferation.</seg>
<seg id="430">About thrombotic, vascular events like myocardial idema, myocardial infarction, cerebrovascular accidents (cerebral haemorrhage, cerebral infarction), arterial thrombosis, pulmonary thrombosis, aneurysm, retinol thromboses, and 11 blood clots in artificial kidneys was reported in patients under Erythropoetin-treatment, as well as patients under epoetin alfa.</seg>
<seg id="431">The most common side effect during treatment with epoetin alfa is a dose-dependent increase in blood pressure or the deterioration of an existing hypertension.</seg>
<seg id="432">Increased incidence of thrombovascular events (see section 4.4 and Section 4.8 - General) was observed in patients under erythropoetine treatment.</seg>
<seg id="433">Independent of erythropoetin-treatment, there may be thrombotic and vascular complications in surgical patients with cardiovascular disease following repeated blood donations.</seg>
<seg id="434">The genetically modified epoetin alfa is glycosiulated and identical to the amino acids and the carbohydrate content with the endogenous human erythropoetin isolated from the urine of infected patients.</seg>
<seg id="435">It could be demonstrated with the help of cultures of human bone marrow cells that epoetin alfa specifically stimulates the erythropoesis and does not influence leukopoesis.</seg>

<seg id="586">Treatment of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women and in men with increased risk of fractures, including in patients with a recently suffered low-traumatic hip fracture.</seg>
<seg id="587">The patient information package should be provided and the following core messages include: • The package insert • Contradication of calcium and vitamin D, appropriate physical activity, non-smoking and a healthy diet • Important signs and symptoms for serious side effects • When to resort to medical or nursing assistance</seg>
<seg id="588">Osteoporosis treatment in postmenopausal women • in men with increased risk of fractures, including patients with a recently suffered low-traumatic hip fracture.</seg>
<seg id="589">For the treatment of postmenopausal osteoporosis and osteoporosis in men, an intravenous infusion of 5 mg Aclasta is recommended once a year.</seg>
<seg id="590">In patients with a low-traumatic hip fracture, the infusion of acetone infusion is recommended two or more weeks after the surgical treatment of the hip fracture (see Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="591">For the treatment of the Morbus Paget, Aclasta should only be prescribed by doctors who have experience in treating the Morbus Paget.</seg>
<seg id="592">After treatment of the disease Paget with Aclasta a long remission period was observed in patients who responded to the therapy (see Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="593">In addition, it is highly advisable to provide sufficient calcium intake for patients with Morbus Paget, accordingly twice daily at least 500 mg of elementary calcium for at least 10 days after the administration of Aclasta (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="594">In patients with a recently suffered low-traumatic hip fracture an initial dose of 50,000 to 125,000 I.U. of orally or intramuscular vitamin D is recommended before the first acetate infusion.</seg>
<seg id="595">The frequency of symptoms occurring within the first three days after the administration of acetamol or ibuprofen can be reduced shortly after the application of Aclasta.</seg>
<seg id="596">Patients with kidney function disorder (see section 4.4) In patients with a creatine clearing &lt; 35 ml / min, Aclasta is not recommended because limited clinical experience is available for this group of patients.</seg>
<seg id="597">Elderly patients (≥ 65 years) A dose adaptation is not necessary, as the bioavailability, distribution and elimination of older patients is similar to younger patients.</seg>
<seg id="598">Children and adolescents Aclasta are not recommended for use in children and adolescents under the age of 18, as data is lacking for safety and effectiveness.</seg>
<seg id="599">Aclasta is not recommended in patients with severe kidney failure (Creatinin-Clearance &lt; 35 ml / min) as there are limited clinical experience for these patients.</seg>
<seg id="600">Preexisting hypokalemia is to be treated with Aclasta before starting treatment with calcium and vitamin D (see Section 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="601">Due to the rapid insertion of the effect of zoledronylic acid on bone reconstruction, a temporary, sometimes symptomatic hypokalemia can develop, the maximum occurs usually within the first 10 days after the infusion of Aclasta (see Section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="602">In addition, it is highly advisable to ensure adequate intake of calcium for at least 10 days after the gift of Aclasta in patients with Morbus Paget (see section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="603">Cancer, chemotherapy, treatment with corticosteroids (poor oral hygiene) should be examined with appropriate preventive dental treatment before applying bisphosphonate.</seg>
<seg id="604">There are no data available for patients who need dental interventions, whether the interruption of the treatment with bisphosphonates reduces the risk of osteonecrosis in the jaws.</seg>
<seg id="605">The clinical evaluation by the treating physician should be the basis for the treatment plan of each patient and based on an individual benefit-risk assessment.</seg>
<seg id="606">The frequency of symptoms occurring within the first three days after administration of acetamol or ibuprofen can be reduced shortly after the application of Aclasta (see section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="607">The incidence of cases of atrial fibrillation reported as a serious side effect was increased (1.3%) (51 of 3,862) compared to patients receiving placebo (0.6%) (22 of 3,852).</seg>
<seg id="608">In the osteoporosis studies (PFT, HORIZON - Recurrent Fracture Trial [RFT]), the total frequency of atrial fibrillation between Aclasta (2.6%) and placebo (2.1%) was comparable.</seg>
<seg id="609">Very common (≥ 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 10), occasional (≥ 1 / 1000, &lt; 1 / 100), rare (≥ 1 / 10,000, &lt; 1 / 1,000) of adverse drug effects are listed in Table 1.</seg>
<seg id="610">Kidney function disorder (zoledronutrient) was associated with kidney function disorders, which, as a decrease in the renal function (i.e. an increase in serum creatine) and in rare cases, expressed as acute renal failure.</seg>
<seg id="611">The change in the creatinin-Clearance (measured annually before the administration) and the occurrence of kidney failure as well as a limited renal function were comparable in a clinical study for osteoporosis over three years between the Aclasta- and the placebo group.</seg>
<seg id="612">A temporary increase in serum creatinins within 10 days of the gift was observed in 1.8% of patients treated with Aclasta compared to 0.8% of patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="613">Based on the evaluation of the laboratory findings, the temporary asymptomatic calcium levels below the normal fluctuation range (less than 2.10 mmol / l) occurred in 2.3% of patients treated with Aclasta in a large clinical study compared to 21% of patients treated with aclasta in the disease pathogens.</seg>
<seg id="614">All patients received sufficient amounts of vitamin D and calcium in the postmenopausal osteoporosis study, in the study to prevent clinical fractures after hip fracture and in the Morbus Paget studies (see section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="615">In the study of preventing clinical fractures after a recently suffered hip fracture, vitamin D levels were not routinely measured but the majority of patients received an initial dose of vitamin D prior to the administration of Aclasta (see section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="616">Local reactions following the administration of zoledronylic acid in a large clinical study were reported about local reactions at the infusion point, such as redness, swelling and / or pain (0.7%).</seg>
<seg id="617">Osteonecrosis in the jaws of the jaws has been reported, especially in cancer patients, via osteonecrosis (primarily in the jaw region), which were treated with bisphosphonates, including Zoledroneic acid.</seg>
<seg id="618">Many of these patients had signs of local infections including osteomyelitis, and the majority of reports refer to cancer patients after tooth extraction or other dental procedures.</seg>
<seg id="619">Seven patients with 7,736 patients treated osteoarthritis in the jaws of a patient with aclasta and a placebo-treated patients.</seg>
<seg id="620">In case of overdose, which leads to clinically relevant hypokalemia, a compensation of oral calcium and / or an intravenous infusion of calcium gluconate can be achieved.</seg>
<seg id="621">Clinical effectiveness in the treatment of postmenopausal osteoporosis (PFT) The effectiveness and safety of Aclasta 5 mg once a year for 3 consecutive years has been shown in postmenopausal women (7,736 women aged between 65 and 89 years) with either a bone density value (BMD) -T-Score for the skenkelhal ≤ -2,5 with or without signs of an existing vertebral fracture.</seg>
<seg id="622">Effects on morphometric fluid fractures Aclasta sensed significantly over a period of three years and already after one year the frequency of one or more new vertebral fractures (see table 2).</seg>
<seg id="623">Aclasta-treated patients aged 75 years and older had a 60% reduced risk of vertebrate fractures compared to placebo patients (p &lt; 0.0001).</seg>
<seg id="624">Effects on hip fractures Aclasta showed a consistent lasting effect over three years, resulting in a reduced risk of hip fractures in a 41% (95% CI, 17% to 58%).</seg>
<seg id="625">Effect on bone density (BMD) Aclasta increased bone density on lumbar vertebraic acid, hip and distal radius compared to placebo treatment at all times (6, 12, 24 and 36 months).</seg>
<seg id="626">9 Increase of the bone density of the lumbar spine by 6.7%, the entire hip by 6.0%, the lower leg by 5.1% and the distal radius by 3.2%.</seg>
<seg id="627">Bone histology With 152 post-menopausal osteoporotic patients treated with Aclasta (N = 82) or placebo (N = 70), a year after the third annual dose of bone biopsies, bone biopsies from the pelvic area were taken.</seg>
<seg id="628">In comparison with placebo, a microcomputer tomography (µCT) analysis showed an increase in trabecular bone volume and the preservation of the trabecular bone architecture.</seg>
<seg id="629">Bone turnover marker The bone-specific alkaline phosphatase (BSAP), the N-terminal propeptide of the type I- collagen (P1NP) in serum and the beta-C telopeptid (b-CTx) in serum were determined in subgroups of 517 to 1,246 patients during periods of study.</seg>
<seg id="630">The treatment with an annual 5 mg dose Aclasta significantly reduced BSAP after 12 months compared to baseline and was held at 28% below the initial value up to 36 months.</seg>
<seg id="631">P1NP was significantly reduced by 61% below the initial value after 12 months and was held at 52% below the initial value up to 36 months.</seg>
<seg id="632">B-CTx was significantly reduced by 61% below the initial value after 12 months and was maintained at 55% below the initial value up to 36 months.</seg>
<seg id="633">The vitamin D mirrors were not routinely measured but the majority of patients received initial dose of vitamin D (50.000 to 125,000 I.U. in oral or intramuscular) 2 weeks prior to infusion.</seg>
<seg id="634">The total mortality was 10% (101 patients) in the group treated with Aclasta compared to 13% (141 patients) in the placebo group.</seg>
<seg id="635">Effect on bone mineral density (BMD) In the HORIZON-RFT study, the aclasta treatment increased BMD compared to placebo treatment at all times.</seg>
<seg id="636">The treatment of acetlasta over 24 months compared to placebo treatment led to an increase of BMD by 5.4% in total and 4.3% at the Schenkelhal.</seg>
<seg id="637">Clinical efficacy in men In the HORIZON-RFT study, 508 men were randomised and in 185 patients the BMD was evaluated after 24 months.</seg>
<seg id="638">The study was not designed to show a reduction in clinical fractures in men; the incidence of clinical fractures was 7.5% in men treated by Aclasta compared to 8.7% in placebo.</seg>
<seg id="639">In another study in males (Study CZOL446M2308), the once annual administration of Aclasta was not inferior to the percentage change in the lumbar vertebrae BMD compared to the previous year compared to the initial value.</seg>
<seg id="640">Clinical effectiveness of the treatment with Morbus Paget of the bone Aclasta has been studied in patients aged over 30 years with radiologically verified (medium serum levels of alkaline phosphatase according to the 2,6fold to 3-fold age-specific upper normal value when taking into the study).</seg>
<seg id="641">11 The effectiveness of an infusion of 5 mg of zoledroneic acid compared to intake of 30 mg of risedronate once daily during 2 months was proven in two six months comparative studies.</seg>
<seg id="642">In the combined results, a similar decrease in pain strength and pain influence was observed after 6 months compared to the initial value for aclasta and risedronate.</seg>
<seg id="643">Patients who were classified as response to therapy at the end of the six-month main study (responded to therapy) could be included in a follow-up phase.</seg>
<seg id="644">From the 143 with aclasta and 107 patients treated with Risedronat patients who participated in the follow-up study, the therapeutic response at 141 of patients treated with Risedronat could be maintained in an average duration of the follow-up phase of 18 months after the application.</seg>
<seg id="645">One-time and multiple 5 and 15 minutes lasting infusion of 2, 4, 8 and 16 mg of zoledroneic acid in 64 patients showed the following pharmacokinetic data, which proved to be dosisindependent.</seg>
<seg id="646">After that, the plasma level rapidly decreased to &lt; 10% of the maximum value after 4 h and &lt; 1% after 24 h, followed by a long-lasting phase of very low concentration, not more than 0.1% of the maximum value.</seg>
<seg id="647">Rapid biphasic disappearing from the large cycle with half-life t ½ α = 0.24 and t ½ β 1.87 hours, followed by a long period of elimination with a terminal Elimination period t ½ g 146 hours.</seg>
<seg id="648">The early stages of distribution (α and β, with the above t ½ -values) presumably represent the rapid resorption into the bones and excretion via the kidneys.</seg>
<seg id="649">In the first 24 hours there are 39 ± 16% of the administered dose in the urine, while the rest is mainly bonded to bone tissue.</seg>
<seg id="650">The total body-clearance is independent of the dose 5.04 ± 2.5 l / h and remains unaffected by sex, age, race or body weight.</seg>
<seg id="651">An extension of the infusion time of 5 to 15 minutes led to decrease of the zoledron acid concentration by 30% at the end of the infusion, but had no effect on the surface under the curve (plasma concentration at time).</seg>
<seg id="652">A diminished clearance of metabolised substances by cytochrom P450 enzyme systems is unlikely because zoledroneic acid is not metabolized in humans and because it is a weak or no direct and / or irreversible, substance-dependent inhibitor of P450-</seg>
<seg id="653">Special patient groups (see section 4.2) The renal clearing of the zoledronic acid correlated with the creatinin clearing, namely 75 ± 33% of the creatinin-Clearance, and was in the mean 84 ± 29 ml / min (range 22 to 143 ml / min) in the 64 examined patients.</seg>
<seg id="654">This results in an easy (Clcr = 50- 80 ml / min) and a moderate renal dysfunction down to a creatine clearing up to 35 ml / min does not require any dose adaptation of the zoledroneic acid.</seg>
<seg id="655">Because there are only limited data for severe kidney function disorder (Kreatinin- Clearance &lt; 30 ml / min), no statements are possible for this population.</seg>
<seg id="656">Acute toxicity The highest non-platinum-acting intravenous single dose was 10 mg / kg body weight in mice and 0.6 mg / kg body weight in rats.</seg>
<seg id="657">For studies on dogs single doses of 1,0 mg / kg (based on AUC, six times the recommended human-therapeutic exposure), administered over a period of 15 minutes, well and without a renal influence.</seg>
<seg id="658">Chronic and chronic toxicity In studies with intravenous application, the renal tolerability of zoledronic acid in rats was administered by doses of 0.6 mg / kg as 15-minute infusion in 3-day intervals, a total of 6 times (a cumulative dose corresponding to the 7x of the human-therapeutic exposure, related to the AUC, corresponds to the AUC).</seg>
<seg id="659">In long-term studies with repeated exposure to cumulated exposures that exceeded the maximum of intended human exposure, toxicological effects in other organs including gastrointestinal tract and liver, as well as the intravenous injection site, occurred.</seg>
<seg id="660">The most frequent occurrence in studies with repeated use was an increased primary spongiosa in the metaphysis of the long bones in animals in the growth phase with almost all dosages, an infection that reflects the pharmacological, antiresorphic effect of the substance.</seg>
<seg id="661">In rats a teratogeneity was observed in doses above 0.2 mg / kg as outer and inner (visceral) abnormalities and such of the skeleton.</seg>
<seg id="662">No teratogenic effects or embryo-fetal effects were observed on rabbits, although the maternal toxicity was 0.1 mg / kg as a result of low serum calcium levels.</seg>
<seg id="663">If the medicine is not used immediately, the user is responsible for the storage time after preparation and the conditions before the application; normally 24 hours should not be exceeded at 2 ° C to 8 ° C.</seg>

<seg id="671">Zoledroneic acid is a representative of a substance called bisphosphonate and is used for the treatment of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women, osteoporosis in men and the disease pathogen.</seg>
<seg id="672">Decreasing blood levels of sex hormones, especially estrogens made of androgens, play a role in the gradual loss of bone mass observed in men.</seg>
<seg id="673">With the Morbus Paget bone reconstruction is too fast, and new bone material is built in an unorganised way, which makes the bone material weaker than normal.</seg>
<seg id="674">Aclasta works by normalising the bone reconstruction, ensuring normal bone formation and gives the bone its strength once again.</seg>
<seg id="675">If you are undergoing dental treatment or undergoing dental surgery, tell your doctor that you are treated with Aclasta.</seg>
<seg id="676">If you use Aclasta with other medicines, please inform your doctor, pharmacist or nursing staff if you use / apply other medicines or have recently taken / applied medication even if it is not prescription medicine.</seg>
<seg id="677">It is especially important for your doctor to know if you are taking medicine that is known to damage the kidneys.</seg>
<seg id="678">When using Aclasta along with food and drink, you should be worried that you have enough fluids according to your doctor's instructions before and after the treatment with Aclasta.</seg>
<seg id="679">The usual dose is 5 mg once a year given to you by your doctor or nursing staff as infusion in a vein.</seg>
<seg id="680">If you recently broke the hip, it is recommended to make the administration of Aclasta two or more weeks after the hip fracture.</seg>
<seg id="681">The usual dose is 5 mg administered to you by your doctor or nursing staff as infusion in a vein.</seg>
<seg id="682">Since Aclasta works for a long time, you may need another dose only after one year or more.</seg>
<seg id="683">It is important to follow these instructions carefully so that the calcium level in your blood is not too low in time after infusion.</seg>
<seg id="684">With Morbus Paget, Aclasta can work for more than a year, and your doctor will inform you if you need a renewed treatment.</seg>
<seg id="685">If the administration of Aclasta was missed, get in touch with your doctor or hospital immediately to arrange a new appointment.</seg>
<seg id="686">Before completing the therapy with Aclasta If you are considering ending treatment with Aclasta, please check your next doctor's appointment and discuss this with your doctor.</seg>
<seg id="687">Side effects associated with the first infusion very often occur (with more than 30% of patients), but are less frequent following subsequent infusions.</seg>
<seg id="688">Fever and chills, muscle or joint pain and headaches occur within the first three days after the administration of Aclasta.</seg>
<seg id="689">Currently it is unclear whether Aclasta causes this irregular heartbeat, but you should report it to your doctor if you notice such symptoms after you have received Aclasta.</seg>
<seg id="690">Physical signs because of too low calcium concentration in the blood, such as muscle cramps or tingling or numbing sensation, especially around the mouth.</seg>

<seg id="692">Persistent pain and / or not healing wounds in the mouth or jaws were reported primarily in patients treated with bisphosphonates because of other diseases.</seg>
<seg id="693">Allergic reactions including rare cases of respiratory problems, hives and angioedema (such as swelling in the face, tongue, or throat) have been reported.</seg>
<seg id="694">Please inform your doctor, pharmacist or nursing staff if any of the side effects listed you are significantly impaired or you notice side effects that are not listed in this information information.</seg>
<seg id="695">If the medicine is not used immediately, the user is responsible for the storage time and conditions until the application; normally 24 hours should not be exceeded at 2 ° C to 8 ° C.</seg>
<seg id="696">In patients with a recently suffered low-traumatic hip fracture, the infusion of Aclasta is recommended two or more weeks after the surgical treatment of the hip fracture.</seg>
<seg id="697">Before and after the administration of Aclasta, patients must be sufficiently supplied with fluid; this is particularly important in patients receiving diuretic therapy.</seg>
<seg id="698">Due to the rapid insertion of the effect of zoledroneic acid on bone reconstruction, a temporary, sometimes symptomatic-current, hypokalemia can develop, the maximum occurs usually within the first 10 days after the infusion of Aclasta.</seg>

<seg id="749">Summary of the EPAR to the public The present document is a summary of the European Public Transport Report (EPAR), which explains how the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) has assessed the studies carried out to make recommendations regarding the use of the drug.</seg>
<seg id="750">Actos is used for the treatment of type 2 diabetes (also known as non-insulin-dependent diabetes). it can be used alone (monotherapy) in patients (especially overweight patients) where metformin (a diabetes drug) is not indicated.</seg>
<seg id="751">It can be used in addition to metformin in patients (especially overweight patients) who cannot be satisfactory with metformin alone in the highest tolerated dose.</seg>
<seg id="752">In combination with a sulfonyresp or insulin, the previous dose of the sulphonyl resin or insulin can be retained with the onset of the Actos treatment, except in patients with hypoglycemia (low blood sugar); this should reduce the dose of the sulphonyl resin or insulin.</seg>
<seg id="753">This means that the body's insulin can be better utilized and the blood sugar level drops, allowing type 2 diabetes to be better adjusted.</seg>
<seg id="754">In more than 1,400 patients the efficacy of Actos was studied in tripletherapy; patients received a combination of metformin with a sulphonyl resin, in addition they received up to 3.5 years either Actos or placebo.</seg>
<seg id="755">In the studies the concentration of a substance in the blood (glycosylated hemoglobin, HbA1c) was measured, indicating how well the blood sugar is set.</seg>
<seg id="756">Actos led to a lowering of the HbA1c value, which makes it possible to reduce blood sugar levels by using the dosage of 15 mg, 30 mg and 45 mg.</seg>
<seg id="757">At the end of the tripletherapy study, the effect of the additional administration of actos for existing treatment with metformin and a sulfonypher was reduced by 0.94% while the additional addition of placebo resulted in a reduction of 0.35%.</seg>
<seg id="758">In a small study, where the combination of actos and insulin was studied in 289 patients, patients who received insulin in addition to insulin were lowering HbA1c values of 0.69% after 6 months, compared with 0.14% in patients receiving placebo.</seg>
<seg id="759">The most common side effects associated with Actos were visual disturbances, upper respiratory tract infections (colds), weight gain and hypothetics (decreased sensitivity to stimuli).</seg>
<seg id="760">Actos should not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to pioglitazone or any of the other components, nor in patients with liver problems, congestive heart failure or diabetic ketoacidosis (high level of ketone levels - acid levels - in the blood).</seg>
<seg id="761">It has been decided that Actos should be used as an alternative to standard treatment with metformin in patients where metformin is not indicated.</seg>
<seg id="762">In October 2000, the European Commission issued a permit to Takeda Europe R & D Centre Limited to approve Actos' placing on the market throughout the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="763">The tablets are white to whitish, round, arched and carry on one side the mark "15" and on the other hand the inscription "Actos."</seg>
<seg id="764">Pioglitazone is also indicated for the combination of insulin for patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus whose blood sugar is insufficient with insulin and where metformin is inappropriate due to contraindications or intolerance (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="765">No data is available for the application of pioglitazone in patients under 18 years of age, therefore the application in this age group is not recommended.</seg>
<seg id="766">In patients who are at risk of developing at least one risk factor (e.g. earlier cardiac infarction or symptomatic coronary heart disease), the physician should start the treatment with the lowest available dose and increase the dose gradually.</seg>
<seg id="767">Patients should be observed for signs and symptoms of heart failure, weight gain or edema, especially those with reduced cardiac reserve.</seg>
<seg id="768">Patients should be observed for signs and symptoms of heart failure, weight gain, and edema when pioglitazone is used in combination with insulin.</seg>
<seg id="769">A cardiovascular outcome study with pioglitazone in patients under 75 years with type 2 diabetes mellitus and pre-existing advanced macrovascular disease has been carried out.</seg>
<seg id="770">This study showed an increase in the report on heart failure, but this did not lead to an increase in mortality in the study.</seg>
<seg id="771">In patients with elevated output hepatic (ALT &gt; 2.5 x upper limit) or with other signs of liver disease, Pioglitazone may not be used.</seg>
<seg id="772">If the ALT mirrors are increased to 3 times the upper limit of the normal range, the liver enzyme levels are to be checked again as soon as possible.</seg>
<seg id="773">If a patient develops symptoms that indicate a hepatic dysfunction, such as unexplained nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, fatigue, loss of appetite and / or dark urine, the liver enzyme levels are to be examined.</seg>
<seg id="774">The decision whether the treatment of the patient with Pioglitazone continues, should be guided by the clinical evaluation until the completion of the laboratory parameters.</seg>
<seg id="775">In clinical studies with pioglitazone, a dose-dependent weight gain has been detected, which can stem from adipose deposits and is associated with a fluid retention in some cases.</seg>
<seg id="776">As a result of hemodilution, a minor reduction of the mean hemoglobin values (relative reduction of 4%) and hematokrite (relative reduction of 4.1%) occurred under the treatment with pioglitazone.</seg>
<seg id="777">Similar changes were observed in comparative controlled trials with Pioglitazone in patients under metformin (relative reduction of hemoglobin by 3-4% and hemoglobin by 1-2% and hemoglobin by 1-3.2%).</seg>
<seg id="778">As a consequence of increased insulin sensitivity, patients who receive Pioglitazone as oral two-fold or triple combination therapy with a sulfonyresp or as two-fold combination therapy with insulin have the risk of dosed hypoglycemia.</seg>
<seg id="779">After the market launch was reported under treatment with thiazoldindions, including pioglitazone, via a occurrence or deterioration of diabetic macular edema with a reduction in visual acuity.</seg>
<seg id="780">It is unclear whether there is direct connection between the intake of pioglitazone and the occurrence of macular edema, but cornering doctors should be aware of the possibility of macular edema when patients report about disorders of visual acuity; a suitable ophthalmological examination should be considered.</seg>
<seg id="781">In a summarizing analysis of adverse events regarding bone fractures from randomised controlled, controlled, double-blind clinical studies over a period of up to 3.5 years with over 8,100 patients treated with pioglitazone</seg>
<seg id="782">The calculated fracture incidence was 1.9 fractures per 100 patient years in patients treated with pioglitazone and 1.1 fractures per 100 patient years in women treated with a comparative medication.</seg>
<seg id="783">In the ProActive study, a study of 3.5 years for the study of cardiovascular events, fractures occurred at 44 / 870 (5.1%; 1.0 fractures per 100 patient years) of patients treated with Pioglitazone, compared with 23 / 905 (2.5%; 0.5 fractures per 100 patient years) in patients who were treated with a comparative medication.</seg>
<seg id="784">Patients should be aware of the possibility of a pregnancy and if a patient wishes to receive a pregnancy or if this occurs, the treatment is to be aborted (see section 4.6).</seg>
<seg id="785">Studies on the interaction of interactions have shown that Pioglitazone has no relevant effects on the pharmacokinetics or pharmacodynamics of digoxin, warfarin, phenprocoumon and metformin.</seg>
<seg id="786">Interactions with medicines that are metabolized by these enzymes, such as oral contraceptives, cyclosporine, calcium channel blocker and HMGCoA reductase inhibitors are not expected.</seg>
<seg id="787">The simultaneous use of pioglitazone with gemfibrozil (a cytochrom P450 2C8- inhibitor) resulted in an increase in the AUC of Pioglitazone by 3-fold.</seg>
<seg id="788">The simultaneous use of pioglitazone with rifampicin (a cytochrom P450 2C8 inductor) resulted in lowering the AUC of pioglitazone by 54%.</seg>
<seg id="789">This is due to the fact that, under treatment with pioglitazone, the hyperinsulin sensitivity associated with pregnancy increases and increases the availability of the metabolic substrates for fetal growth.</seg>
<seg id="790">Very common &gt; 1 / 10; often &gt; 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 100; occasionally &gt; 1 / 10000, &lt; 1 / 1000; very rare &lt; 1 / 10000, single cases: unknown (not estimated from present data).</seg>
<seg id="791">These lead to a temporary alteration of the turgor and refraction index of the lens, as observed in other hypoglycaemic agents.</seg>
<seg id="792">In clinical studies with Pioglitazone, ALT-Anstiege were more than three times the upper limit of the normal range as often as under placebo, but less often than in comparison groups under metformin or sulfonyresp.</seg>
<seg id="793">In an outcome study in patients with advanced macrovascular disease incidence of severe heart failure under pioglitazone was 1.6% higher than placebo, if pioglitazone or pioglitazone.</seg>
<seg id="794">Since market launch has rarely been reported on cardiac insufficiency in Pioglitazone, however, more frequently if pioglitazone was used in combination with insulin or in patients with congestive heart failure in anamnesis.</seg>
<seg id="795">A summarizing analysis of adverse events regarding bone fractures from randomised controlled, controlled, double-blind clinical studies over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,100 patients in the groups treated with Pioglitazone and more than 7,400 patients were performed in groups treated with comparative medication.</seg>
<seg id="796">Over a period of 3.5 years, fractures were treated at 44 / 870 (5.1%) of patients treated with Pioglitazone, compared with 23 / 905 (2.5%) in patients who were treated with a comparative medication.</seg>
<seg id="797">When taking the reported maximum dose of 120 mg / day for four days, then 180 mg / day over seven days, no symptoms appeared.</seg>
<seg id="798">Pioglitazone seems to have an activation of specific core receptors (peroxisome proliferation activated reeptor-γ) (PPAR-γ)), leading to increased insulin sensitivity of liver, fat and skeletal muscle cells in the animal model.</seg>
<seg id="799">It could be demonstrated that Pioglitazone reduces glucose production in the liver and increases the peripheral glucose level in the case of insulin resistance.</seg>
<seg id="800">A clinical study with Pioglitazone versus Gliclacide as monotherapy has been continued for two years to investigate the time to follow the therapeutic effect (defined as HbA1c ≥ 8.0% after the first 6 months of treatment).</seg>
<seg id="801">At the time after two years after the beginning of the therapy, blood sugar control (defined as HbA1c &lt; 8.0%) could be maintained by pioglitazone in 69% of the patients treated (compared to 50% of patients under Gliclacide).</seg>
<seg id="802">In a placebo-controlled trial over 12 months, patients whose blood sugar was insufficient with insulin despite three months of optimization were randomised to pioglitazone or placebo.</seg>
<seg id="803">In patients below Pioglitazone, the mean HbA1c decreased by 0.45% compared to patients receiving insulin; a reduction in insulin dose in the group treated with Pioglitazone was observed.</seg>
<seg id="804">In clinical trials over a year, a statistically significant decrease of albumin / creatinine quotients showed a statistically significant decrease of albumin / creatinin quotients.</seg>
<seg id="805">The effect of pioglitazone (monotherapy with 45 mg versus placebo) was tested in a small, 18-week study of type 2 diabetes.</seg>
<seg id="806">In most clinical trials compared to placebo, a reduction in total plasma triglycerides and free fatty acids and an increase in HDL cholesterol levels as well as slightly, but clinically not significantly increased LDL cholesterol levels were observed.</seg>
<seg id="807">In clinical trials over a period of up to two years, Pioglitazone reduced the total plastic glycerides and free fatty acids as compared to placebo, metformin or gliclacide and increased HDL cholesterol levels.</seg>
<seg id="808">In comparison to placebo, no statistically significant increase in LDL cholesterol was observed under Pioglitazone while lower values were observed under metformin and licenticules.</seg>
<seg id="809">In a study over 20 weeks, Pioglitazone reduced not only the intimidating triglycerides but also improved the postdendial increased triglyceride levels, this has an effect on triglyceride concentrations as well as the hepatic triglyceride level.</seg>
<seg id="810">In the ProActive study, a cardiovascular outcome study, 5238 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and pre-existing advanced macrovascular disease were randomised into groups who received either pioglitazone or placebo over a period of up to 3.5 years.</seg>
<seg id="811">After oral application pioglitazone is absorbed quickly, whereby the peak concentrations of unmodified Pioglitazone in plasma are usually reached 2 hours after application.</seg>
<seg id="812">On this basis, the contribution of M-IV to effectiveness is equivalent to the triple of the efficacy of pioglitazone whereas the relative effectiveness of M-II is minimal.</seg>
<seg id="813">In interaction studies it could be proven that pioglitazone does not have a relevant effect on the pharmacokinetics or pharmacodynamics of digoxin, warfarin, phenprocoumon and metformin.</seg>
<seg id="814">The simultaneous use of pioglitazone with gemfibrozil (a cytochrom P450 2C8 inhibitor) or with rifampicine (a cytochrom P450 2C8 inductor) increases or lowers the plasma concentration of Pioglitazone (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="815">After the orally application of radioactively marked pioglitazone in humans the marker was found mainly in the feces (55%) and to a lesser extent in urine (45%).</seg>
<seg id="816">The mean plasma-elimination-time of unchanged Pioglitazone is 5-6 hours in humans, and the total active metabolites is 16 - 23 hours.</seg>
<seg id="817">The plasma concentrations of pioglitazone and its metabolites are lower in patients with reduced kidney function than in healthy volunteers, but the rates of the oral clearance of the parent substance are similar.</seg>
<seg id="818">In toxicological studies occurred in mice, rats, dogs and monkeys after repeated administration of plasma volume enlargement with haemodilution, anaemia and reversible excentric hypertrophie.</seg>
<seg id="819">This is due to the fact that, under treatment with pioglitazone, the hyperinsulinemia resulting in the gestation diminishes and increases the availability of the metabolic substrates for fetal growth.</seg>
<seg id="820">In long-term studies (up to 2 years), increased incidence of hyperplasia (in male and female rats) and tumours (in male rats) was induced by the urinary tract epithelium.</seg>
<seg id="821">In an animal model of the family adenomatous polyposis (FAP), treatment with two other thiazoldindions led to increased frequency of colon tumours.</seg>
<seg id="822">The tablets are white to whitish, round, flat and carry on one side the mark "30" and on the other hand the inscription "Actos."</seg>
<seg id="823">The calculated fracture incidence was 1.9 fractures per 100 patient years in patients treated with pioglitazone and 1.1 fractures per 100 patient years in women treated with a comparative medication.</seg>
<seg id="824">In the ProActive study, a study of 3.5 years for the study of cardiovascular events, fractures occurred at 44 / 870 (5.1%; 1.0 fractures per 100 patient years) of patients treated with Pioglitazone, compared with 23 / 905 (2.5%; 0.5 fractures per 100 patient years) in patients who were treated with a comparative medication.</seg>
<seg id="825">In another study over two years the effects of a combination therapy of metformin were investigated with either Pioglitazone or Gliclacide.</seg>
<seg id="826">In clinical studies more than 1 year, a statistically significant decrease of albumin / creatinine quotients was statistically significant compared to baseline values.</seg>
<seg id="827">In a study more than 20 weeks, Pioglitazone reduced not only the intimidating triglycerides but also improved postdendial increased triglyceride levels, this has an effect on tryglycerid absorption as well as the hepatic Tryglicerid synthesis.</seg>
<seg id="828">Although the study was missing the target with regard to its primary endpoint, which presented a combination of the total mortality, non-lethal myocardial infarction, stroke, acute coronary syndrome, leg amputation above the ankles, coronary revascularisation and reascularisation of the leg arteries, the results suggest that with the intake of pioglitazone no cardiovascular long-term risks are connected.</seg>
<seg id="829">The tablets are white to whitish, round, flat and carry on one side the mark "45" and on the other hand the inscription "Actos."</seg>
<seg id="830">In a summarizing analysis of adverse events regarding bone fractures from randomised controlled, controlled, double-blind clinical studies over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,100 patients treated with pioglitazone and more than 7,400 patients receiving comparative medication, there was a increased incidence of fractures in women.</seg>
<seg id="831">In the ProActive study, a study of 3.5 years for the study of cardiovascular events, fractures occurred at 44 / 870 (5.1%; 1.0 fractures per 100 patient years) of patients treated with Pioglitazone, compared with 23 / 905 (2.5%; 0.5 fractures per 100 patient years) in patients who were treated with a comparative medication.</seg>
<seg id="832">In a study over 20 weeks, Pioglitazone reduced not only the intimidating triglycerides but also improved the postdendial increased triglyceride levels, this has an effect on triglyceride concentrations as well as the hepatic triglyceride level.</seg>

<seg id="864">Actrophane was enrolled in a total of 294 patients with type 1 diabetes, in which the pancreas cannot produce insulin, and type 2 diabetes, in which the body is unable to use insulin effectively.</seg>
<seg id="865">In the study, the concentration of a substance (glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) was measured after 12 weeks, indicating how well the blood sugar is set.</seg>
<seg id="866">Actraphane resulted in a decrease in the HbA1c level that indicated that the blood sugar levels were similar to another human insulin.</seg>
<seg id="867">Acetphane should not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to human insulin (rDNA) or any of the other components.</seg>
<seg id="868">The doses of acetphane may also be adapted if it is administered together with a number of other medicines that can affect blood sugar (the complete list is to be found in the packaging template).</seg>
<seg id="869">The Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) concluded that the benefits of actraphane were outweighed in the treatment of diabetes.</seg>
<seg id="870">In October 2002, the European Commission issued a permit to the company Novo Nordisk A / S for the placing of Actraphane on the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="871">Premixed insulin products are usually applied once or twice daily, if a rapid initial action is desired along with a longer lasting effect.</seg>
<seg id="872">The injection needle must be left under the skin for at least 6 seconds to ensure that the entire dose was injected.</seg>
<seg id="873">Patients whose blood sugar level has improved significantly, for example, by intensified insulin therapy, can alter hypoglycemia warning symptoms and should be advised accordingly.</seg>
<seg id="874">Any change regarding strength, brand (manufacturer), insulin type (fast acting, biphasic, long acting insulin, etc.), type of insulin (animal insulin, insulin analog or insulin analogue) and / or manufacturing method (by recombinant DNA versus insulin-animal origin) can cause a change in dosage.</seg>
<seg id="875">If a dose adaptation is necessary when changing to acetphane in the patient, it may be necessary at the first dose or in the first weeks or months after the conversion.</seg>
<seg id="876">Some patients with hypoglycaemic reactions after a change from animal to human insulin reported that early warning symptoms of hypoglycemia were less pronounced or unlike their previous insulin.</seg>
<seg id="877">Before travelling, which go over several time zones, the patient should be advised to collect the advice of his doctor as such trips can cause insulin and meals to be applied or taken at other times.</seg>
<seg id="878">The doctor therefore has to take into account possible interactions during the therapy and always consult his patients according to other medicines they have taken.</seg>
<seg id="879">4 Both hypoglycemia as well as hyperglycemia, which may occur in a not sufficiently controlled diabetes therapy, increase the risk of abnormalities and fertility in utero.</seg>

<seg id="884">Local hypersensitivity reactions (redness, swelling, itching, pain and haematoma at the injection site) may occur during insulin therapy.</seg>
<seg id="885">Diseases of the immune system Occasional - Urticaria, Exanthem Very rare - anaphylactic reactions symptoms of generalized hypersensitivity, including generalized skin rash, itching, sweating, gastrointestinal disorders, angioneurotic oedema, breathing difficulties, palpitations, low blood pressure and fainting / unconsciousness.</seg>
<seg id="886">Hypoglycemia can, however, gradually develop: • Light hypoglycemias can be treated by the oral supply of glucose and sugary foods.</seg>
<seg id="887">Diabetics should therefore always have grape sugar, sweets, biscuits or sugar-containing fruit juice. • Heavy hypoglycemias with unconsciousness are treated with an intramuscular or subcutaneous injection of glucose (0.5 to 1.0 mg) by a proven auxiliary person or given by glucose that is given intravenously by the doctor.</seg>
<seg id="888">The effect starts within half an hour, the maximum effect is reached within 2 to 8 hours and the total duration of activity is up to 24 hours.</seg>
<seg id="889">Resorption The absorption profile is based on the fact that the product is a mixture of insulin products with faster or delayed resorption.</seg>
<seg id="890">A number of fission (hydrolysis) places on the human insulin molecule were considered; none of the metabolites formed by the split is active.</seg>
<seg id="891">Based on conventional studies on safety harmacology, toxicity in repeated application, genotoxicity, carcinogenic potential and reproductive toxicity, preclinical data can not detect any particular dangers to humans.</seg>
<seg id="892">It is recommended - after removing the Actraphane water bottle from the refrigerator - to increase the temperature of the insulin to room temperature (not exceeding 25 ° C) before resuscitating in accordance with the instruction manual for the first use.</seg>
<seg id="893">Some patients with hypoglycaemic reactions after a change from animal to human insulin reported that early warning symptoms of hypoglycemia were less pronounced or unlike their previous insulin.</seg>
<seg id="894">The doctor therefore has to take into account possible interactions during the therapy and always consult his patients according to other medicines they have taken.</seg>

<seg id="1188">Liver disease During phase 3 clinical trials, slight abnormalities of the liver function were observed in patients treated with Febuxostat (3.5%).</seg>
<seg id="1189">It is therefore recommended to carry out a liver function test before the beginning of the basebuxostator treatment (see Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1190">Theophylline tin did not conduct any interaction studies on Febuxostat, but it is known that the XO inhibition can lead to an increase in theophylism mirror (an inhibition of theophylline metabolization was also reported for other XO inhibitors).</seg>
<seg id="1191">In subjects the simultaneous administration of Febuxostat and Naproxen was associated with an increase in basebuxostat exposure (Cmax 28%, AUC 41% and t1 / 2 26%).</seg>
<seg id="1192">In clinical studies the application of naproxen or other NSAR / Cox-2 inhibitors was not related to clinically significant increase of adverse events.</seg>
<seg id="1193">Colchicin / Indometacin / Hydrochlorthiazide / Warfarin Febuxostat can be used together with colchicin or Indometacin without a dose adaptation for Febuxostat or the other active ingredient used at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="1194">In a study with study subjects 120 mg ADENURIC 1 x showed a moderate 22% increase in the AUC of Desipramine, a CYP2D6 substrate, which indicates a possible low inhibitory effect of Febuxostat on the CYP2D6 enzyme in vivo.</seg>
<seg id="1195">Antazida It could be shown that the simultaneous intake of antacids containing magnesium hydroxide and aluminum hydroxide, delays the absorption of Febuxostat (around 1 hour) and a decrease of the Cmax by 32%, but no significant change in AUC.</seg>
<seg id="1196">Pregnancy data over a very limited number of exposed pregnancies can not close to side effects of Febuxostat on pregnancy or the health of the fetus / newborn.</seg>
<seg id="1197">Animal experimental studies do not permit direct or indirect harmful effects on pregnancy, embryonic / fetal development or birth (see Section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="1198">Patients should be cautious when controlling a vehicle, operating machines or exercising hazardous activities until they can be reasonably sure that ADENURIC does not adversely affect their performance.</seg>
<seg id="1199">A numerically higher incidence of cardiovascular events reported by the investigator was observed in the total febuxostats in the pivotal study of phase 3 (1.3 versus 0.7 events per 100 patient years), although no statistically significant differences were found and no causal correlation with Febuxostat could be detected.</seg>
<seg id="1200">The risk factors determined in these patients were an arteriosclerotic condition and / or a myocardial infarction or a decompensated cardiac insufficiency in the medical history.</seg>
<seg id="1201">Frequent (≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10), occasional (≥ 1 / 1000 to &lt; 1 / 100) and rare (≥ 1 / 1000 to &lt; 1 / 1,000) Side effects that could stand in the treatment groups with 80 mg / 120 mg of Febuxostat and which were reported in all Febuxostat treatment groups more than once are listed below.</seg>
<seg id="1202">Diarrhoea, nausea and vomiting are more common in patients who are treated with colchicin at the same time. * * In clinical trials no severe skin rashes or severe hypersensitivity reactions were observed.</seg>
<seg id="1203">7 Open long-term extension studies In the open long-term extension studies, 906 patients were treated for up to 1 year, 322 patients up to 2 years, 57 patients up to 3 years long and 53 patients up to 4 years with Febuxostat 80 mg / 120 mg.</seg>
<seg id="1204">The events reported during long-term studies were similar to those reported in Phase 3 studies (see Table 1).</seg>
<seg id="1205">The following treatment-related events were reported in all basebuxostats more than once and occurred in patients who received Febuxostat 80 mg / 120 mg in long-term extension studies (up to 4 years with an exposure time of &gt; 1,900 patient years), according to the information occasionally.</seg>
<seg id="1206">The following treatment-related events were either not reported at all in pivotal studies in Phase 3 or with a lower frequency:</seg>
<seg id="1207">Diabetes, hyperlipidemia, insomnia, hypesthesia, conspicuous ECG, cough, shortness of skin, skin discolorations, skin lesions, bursitis, protein uria, kidney insufficiency, erectile dysfunction, increase of TSH concentration in blood, decrease in lymphocyte number, decrease in the number of white blood cells.</seg>

<seg id="1210">Clinical study results The efficacy of ADENURIC has been shown in two pivotal studies of Phase 3 (APEX study and FACT study as described below), which were performed with 1,832 patients with hyperuricemia and gout.</seg>
<seg id="1211">The primary efficacy endpoint was in each study the proportion of patients in which the last three monthly serum levels were &lt; 6.0 mg / dl (357 µmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="1212">Placebo (n = 134), ADENURIC 80 mg 1 x daily (n = 269), ADENURIC 240 mg 1 x daily (n = 258) for patients with a serum creatine value at the beginning of study (n = 10) for patients with a serum creatine value at the beginning of study of &gt; 1.5 mg / dl and ≤ 2.0 mg / dl.</seg>
<seg id="1213">The APEX study showed the statistically significant superiority of both the treatment with ADENURIC 80 mg 1 x daily and ADENURIC 120 mg 1 x daily compared to the treatment with conventionally used doses of Allopurinol 300 mg (n = 258) / 100 mg (n = 10).</seg>
<seg id="1214">The FACT study showed a statistically significant superiority in both the treatment with ADENURIC 80 mg 1 x daily and ADENURIC 120 mg 1 x daily compared to the treatment with the usual dose allopurinol 300 mg.</seg>

<seg id="1216">Lowering the serum acid level to &lt; 6.0 mg / dl (357 µmol / l) was observed during the doctor visit in week 2 and maintained permanently over the entire treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1217">509 patients received allocalinol 300 mg 1 x daily; 10 patients with serum creatine values &gt; 1.5 and &lt; 2.0 mg / dl received 100 mg 1 x daily.</seg>
<seg id="1218">Primary endpoint in the subgroup of patients with kidney function restriction The APEX study evaluated the efficacy of 40 patients with renal function restriction (D).</seg>
<seg id="1219">ADENURIC was the primary efficacy endpoint of 44% (80 mg 1 x daily), 45% (120 mg 1 x daily) and 60% (240 mg 1 x daily) of the patients.</seg>
<seg id="1220">There were no clinically significant differences in the percentage return of serum acid concentrations in subjects regardless of their kidney function (58% in the group with normal renal function and 55% in the group with severe kidney function disorders).</seg>
<seg id="1221">Primary endpoint in the subgroup of patients with serum acid concentrations ≥ 10 mg / dl of Etwa 40% of patients (APEX and FACT study) had a serum acid concentration of ≥ 10 mg / dl at the beginning of study (baseline).</seg>
<seg id="1222">The data collected in two years of the open extension study in Phase 3 showed that the permanent decrease in serum acid levels to &lt; 6 mg / dl (&lt; 357 µmol / l) revealed that less than 3% of patients in the months of 16-24 needed a treatment against a thirst-feed (i.e. more than 97% of patients needed no treatment against a gout).</seg>
<seg id="1223">This was associated with a reduction in the size of the greed knot, which resulted in 54% of patients a complete disappearance of the lymph nodes by month 24.</seg>
<seg id="1224">Elevated TSH values (&gt; 5.5 µIE / ml) were observed in patients receiving long-term treatment with Febuxostat (5,0%) and also in patients receiving allocinol (5.8%) in open long-term extension studies (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1225">In healthy subjects, the maximum plasma concentrations (Cmax) and the surface under the plasma concentration time curve (AUC) increased from Febuxostat after administration of simple and multiple doses of 10 mg to 120 mg dose.</seg>
<seg id="1226">For doses between 120 mg and 300 mg, an increase in AUC is observed for Febuxostat, which is greater than the dose-proportional increase.</seg>
<seg id="1227">After taking simple or multiple oral doses of 80 and 120 mg 1 x daily, the Cmax is about 2.8-3.2 µg / ml and 5,0-5.3 µg / ml.</seg>
<seg id="1228">However, no clinically significant change was observed in the percentage decrease in serum acid concentration as long as this was tested (multiple doses of 80 mg).</seg>
<seg id="1229">Distribution The apparent Steady state distribution volume (Vss / F) from Febuxostat is in the range from 29 to 75 l after taking doses of 10-300 mg.</seg>
<seg id="1230">The plasma protein binding of Febuxostat is about 99.2% (primary binding to albumin) and is constant over the concentration range, which is reached with doses of 80 and 120 mg.</seg>

<seg id="1232">After taking an 80 mg dose of 14C-marked Febuxostat, around 49% of the dose in the urine was found to be unchanged Febuxostat (3%), Acylglucuronid of the active substance (30%), its known oxidative metabolites and their conjugate (13%) and other unknown metabolites (3%).</seg>
<seg id="1233">In addition to excretion over the urine also about 45% of the dose in the chair found itself as immutable Febuxostat (12%), Acylglucuronid of the active substance (1%), the known oxidative metabolites and their conjugate (25%) as well as other unknown metabolites (7%).</seg>
<seg id="1234">Special patient groups of renal insufficiency According to taking multiple doses of 80 mg ADENURIC in patients with mild, moderate or severe renal insufficiency, the Cmax of Febuxostat did not change compared to subjects with normal renal function.</seg>
<seg id="1235">The mean total AUC of Febuxostat increased approximately 1.8-fold from 7.5 μ g / ml in the group with normal renal function to 13.2 μ g / ml in the group with severe kidney function.</seg>
<seg id="1236">12 liver function restriction After taking multiple doses of 80 mg ADENURIC in patients with mild (ChildPugh classification A) or moderate (Child-Pugh classification B) liver function restriction, the Cmax and AUC of Febuxostat and its metabolites did not change significantly in comparison to subjects with normal liver function.</seg>

<seg id="1238">Carcinogenesis, mutagenesis, impairment of fertility In male rats, a statistically significant increase of urinary tumours (transition cell papillomas and carcinomas) was found only in connection with Xanthin stones in the highly dosed group, with about 11 times the exposure to humans.</seg>
<seg id="1239">These findings are seen as a result of a specific purine metabolization and urine composition and considered not relevant for clinical use.</seg>
<seg id="1240">It has been found that Febuxostat in oral doses of up to 48 mg / kg / day has no effect on the fertility and reproductive capacity of male and female rats.</seg>
<seg id="1241">In high doses, which were about 3 times the human therapeutic exposure, maternal toxicity occurred which accompanied by lowering the Aufzuchtower and a developmental retardation in the offspring of rats.</seg>

<seg id="1276">The patient must take the tablet with a full glass of water (no mineral water) at least 30 minutes before eating, drinking or taking other medicines (including antacids, calcium and vitamin supplements).</seg>
<seg id="1277">In order to avoid irritation of the esophagus, the patient should not lie down until after the first dietary intake of the day, which is at the earliest 30 minutes after taking the tablet.</seg>
<seg id="1278">Since alendronate and vitamin D3 are already used separately in medicines approved in the European Union, the company presented data originating from previous studies and published literature.</seg>
<seg id="1279">The company also conducted a study of 35 men and 682 post-menopausal women with osteoporosis in order to demonstrate the efficacy of ADROVANCE in terms of increasing vitamin D level.</seg>
<seg id="1280">After a 15 week treatment, the proportion of patients with low vitamin D levels in patients treated with ADROVANCE was lower (11%) than those who received exclusively alendronate (32%).</seg>
<seg id="1281">The company also presented data that indicates that the alendronate dose contained in ADROVANCE corresponds exactly to the dose needed to prevent bone loss.</seg>
<seg id="1282">The most common side effects (observed at 1 to 10 of 100 patients) are headaches, pains of the musculoskeletal system such as abdominal pain, dyspepsia (digestive disorders), constipation, diarrhea (diarrhea), flatulence (ulcera) of esophagus, dysphagia (swallowing disorders), congested abdomen (bloated abdomen) and acidic shocks.</seg>
<seg id="1283">ADROVANCE may not be used in patients with hypersensitivity to alendronate, vitamin D3 or any of the other ingredients.</seg>
<seg id="1284">It may not be used in patients with hypocalcemia (low calcium levels) or in patients who cannot stand or sit upright for at least 30 minutes.</seg>

<seg id="1288">Follow these guidelines exactly to reduce the risk of malignant irritation and associated side effects (see section 4.4):</seg>
<seg id="1289">• ADROVANCE should be swallowed only with a full glass of water (at least 200 ml) after the day. • Patients should not chew the tablet or leave the tablet in the mouth because there is a risk of oropharyngeal ulcera. • Patients should not lie before the first dietary intake of the day, which should take place at the earliest 30 minutes after taking the tablet.</seg>
<seg id="1290">B. peptic ulcers, active gastrointestinal bleedings or surgical procedures in the upper gastrointestinal tract except pyloroplasty (see Section 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="1291">Esophageal reactions such as esophagitis, malignophageal ulcera and ösophageal erosions, rarely followed by malignant fractures, were reported in patients under the ingestion of alendronate (some were severe and required hospitalization).</seg>
<seg id="1292">The doctor should therefore draw attention to all signs and symptoms that may be noted for possible behavioral reactions, and patients should be advised to suspend the drug and seek medical advice in case of symptoms of ecophageal irritation, such as dysphagia, pain in swallowing or retrospital pain or a new or worsening heartburn (see Section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="1293">3 The risk of serious adverse side effects seems to be increased in patients who do not take the medicine correctly and / or continue to take it after the occurrence of symptoms that refer to an esophageal irritation.</seg>
<seg id="1294">It is very important that all dosage instructions are passed on to the patient and understood by the patient (see section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="1295">While in large-scale clinical studies with Alendronat no increased risk was detected, gastric and duodenal ulcerations were rarely reported (after market launch), including some severe and severe complications (see Section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="1296">Osteoarthritis of the jaw, usually associated with a tooth extraction and / or a local infection (including osteomyelitis), was reported in cancer patients whose treatment regimen contains mainly intravenous bisphosphonate.</seg>
<seg id="1297">There are no data available that indicate whether the use of a bisphosphonate therapy in patients who require a orthodontic operation reduces the risk of osteoarthritis of the jaw.</seg>
<seg id="1298">The clinical evaluation by the treating physician is decisive for the treatment planning in each patient based on an individual benefit-risk assessment.</seg>
<seg id="1299">Patients should be instructed that they should take the tablet next morning when taking a dose of ADROVANCE after taking notice of their omission.</seg>
<seg id="1300">You should not take two tablets the same day, but continue taking one tablet per week as planned at the planned weekday.</seg>
<seg id="1301">Other diseases affecting the metabolism (such as vitamin D deficiency and hypoparathyreoidism) should also be adequately addressed before starting therapy with ADROVANCE.</seg>
<seg id="1302">Alendronate foods and beverages (including mineral water), calcium supplements, antacids and some oral medicines may affect the resorption of alendronate when taken at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="1303">Therefore, after taking Alendronat, patients must wait at least 30 minutes before taking other medicines (see Sections 4.2 and 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="1304">Although specific interaction studies were not carried out, Alendronat was taken in clinical trials together with a variety of commonly prescribed drugs without clinically relevant interactions.</seg>

<seg id="1306">Animal studies with alendronate do not indicate direct harmful effects with regard to pregnancy, embryonic / fetal or postnatal development.</seg>
<seg id="1307">Osteoarthritis of the jaw was reported in patients under bisphosphonate; most reports stem from cancer patients, but it was also reported in osteoporosis patients.</seg>
<seg id="1308">Nevertheless, the serum calcium intake was up to &lt; 8.0 mg / dl (2.0 mmol / l) and serum phosphats up to ≤ 2.0 mg / dl (0.65 mmol / l) in both treatment groups with similar frequency.</seg>

<seg id="1327">In healthy volunteers, oral prednisone (20 mg three times daily over five days) did not lead to clinically significant changes in the oral bioavailability of alendronate (increase in average from 20% to 44%).</seg>
<seg id="1328">9 distribution studies on rats have shown that after intravenous administration of alendronate, alendronate is temporarily distributed in tissue tissues after intravenous administration of 1 mg / kg, but then quickly dispersed into the bone or excreted with the urine.</seg>
<seg id="1329">After intravenous administration of a single dose of 14C-Alendronat approximately 50% of the radioactively marked substance were excreted within 72 hours with the urine and little or no radioactivity was found in the feces.</seg>
<seg id="1330">After intravenous administration of a single dose of 10 mg, the renal clearance of alendronate 71 ml / min and systemic clearance did not exceed 200 ml / min.</seg>

<seg id="1403">Furthermore, the results of a clinical study were submitted to 668 patients with kidney transplantation, compared with Prograf / Prograft or Ciclosporin.</seg>
<seg id="1404">The main indicator of efficacy was the number of patients in which the transplant was repelled after a period of one year (for example, by examining how often a renewed organ transplant or resumption of dialysis was required).</seg>
<seg id="1405">In addition, shorter further studies were carried out on 119 patients with kidney transplantation and 129 patients with liver transplant and examined how advagraf is absorbed by the body in comparison to Prograf / Prograft.</seg>

<seg id="1408">Patients and doctors must be cautious if other (especially some herbal) drugs are taken at the same time with advagraf, as the adult dose or dose of the medication taken at the same time needs to be adjusted accordingly.</seg>

<seg id="1410">Only physicians who are familiar with immunosuppressive therapy and treatment of transplant patients should prescribe this medicine or make changes in immunosuppressive therapy.</seg>
<seg id="1411">Due to clinically relevant differences in systemic exposure of tacrolimus, this can lead to graft rejection or increased incidence of side effects, including under- or overimmunosuppression.</seg>
<seg id="1412">Patients should always maintain the same Tacrolimus formulation and the corresponding daily dosage; changes to the formulation or régime should only be carried out under close-meshed control of a physician experienced in the transplantation (see Sections 4.4 and 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="1413">As a result of a conversion to an alternative formulation, a therapeutic drug monitoring and appropriate dose adaptation must be carried out to ensure that the systemic exposure of Tacrolimus is maintained.</seg>
<seg id="1414">The dosage of Advagraf should be based primarily on clinical assessment of rejection and tolerability in individual cases and on blood level provisions (see below "Recommendations")</seg>
<seg id="1415">After switching from Prograf to Advagraf, the Tacrolimus Talmirrors should be controlled before switching and over two weeks after conversion.</seg>
<seg id="1416">On Day 4, systemic exposure, measured as a level mirror, was comparable with both kidney and liver transplanted patients.</seg>
<seg id="1417">Careful and repeated checks of the Tacrolimus Talmirrors are recommended during the first two weeks after transplant under advagraph to ensure proper substance exposure in the immediate post-transplant phase.</seg>
<seg id="1418">As tacrolimus is a low-clearing substance, an adaptation of the anagraf can take several days until the Steady State is reached.</seg>
<seg id="1419">If the patient's condition in the first postoperative period does not allow oral consumption of medicines, the Tacrolimus treatment can be administered intravenously (Prograf 5 mg / ml concentrate to produce an infusion solution) with a dose of ca.</seg>
<seg id="1420">Duration of the application To suppress transplant rejection, immunosuppression must be maintained; consequently, a maximum duration of oral therapy cannot be indicated.</seg>
<seg id="1421">Dosage recommendations - kidney transplantation prophylaxis of graft rejection The oral Advance therapy should start at 0.20 - 0.30 mg / kg / day as once daily gift in the morning.</seg>
<seg id="1422">Further dosage adjustments may be necessary later, as the pharmacokinetics of tacrolimus can change during the course of the patient's stabilisation after the transplant.</seg>
<seg id="1423">Dosage recommendations - liver transplant prophylaxis of graft rejection The oral Advance therapy should start at 0.10 - 0.20 mg / kg / day as once daily gift in the morning.</seg>
<seg id="1424">Dosage recommendation - switching from Prograf to Advagraf Must a graft of twice daily dose of Prograf capsules must be converted to a daily intake of Advagraf, so this conversion has to take place in ratio 1: 1 (mg: mg), related to the entire daily dose.</seg>
<seg id="1425">Renal and liver transplant After switching from other immunosuppressiva to advagraf once daily, the treatment with the oral initialdosage recommended in kidney and liver transplants should begin with the prophylaxis of graft rejection.</seg>
<seg id="1426">Heart transplant In adult patients who are converted to advagraph, an oral initial dose of 0.15 mg / kg / day is taken once a day in the morning.</seg>
<seg id="1427">Other graft recipients, although there are no clinical experience with Advagraf in pulmonary, pancreatic and ectal transplanted patients, received an oral initial dose of 0.10 - 0.15 mg / kg / day and in an oral initial dose of 0.3 mg / kg / day and in an oral initial dose of 0.3 mg / kg / day.</seg>
<seg id="1428">Dose adjustments in specific patient groups Patients with reduced hepatic function In order to maintain blood tal mirroring in the targeted area, a reduction in the dose can be required in patients with severe liver dysfunctions.</seg>
<seg id="1429">Patients with reduced kidney function As the kidney function does not affect the pharmacokinetic of tacrolimus, it can be assumed that dose adaptation is not required.</seg>
<seg id="1430">However, due to the nephrotoxic potential of Tacrolimus, careful monitoring of the renal function (including a regular determination of the serum creatine-level, a calculation of the iniminary system and a monitoring of the urinary volume) is recommended.</seg>
<seg id="1431">Switch from Ciclosporin to Advagraf When switching from a Ciclosport to a Tacrolimus-based therapy, caution is required (see Sections 4.4 and 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1432">The dose should be based primarily on clinical assessment of rejection and tolerability in individual cases with the use of full blood tacrolimus-level mirror controls.</seg>
<seg id="1433">It is recommended to carry out frequent checks of the Tacrolimus Talmirrors during the first two weeks after transplantation, followed by periodic checks during maintenance therapy.</seg>
<seg id="1434">Tacrolimus's blood-talent levels should also be controlled after switching from Prograf to advagraph, dose adjustment, immunosuppressive therapy, or simultaneous use of substances that might alter the Tacrolimus full blood concentration (see Section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1435">Since advagraf is a medicine with a low clearance, modifications of the dose may require several days until the Steady State has entered.</seg>
<seg id="1436">Clinical trials suggest that successful treatment is possible in most cases if the levels of the valley do not exceed 20 ng / ml.</seg>
<seg id="1437">In clinical practice, the levels of Tacrolimus in thoroughbred in the first time after liver transplantation are usually in the range of 5 - 20 ng / ml and for kidney and heart transplanted patients at 10 - 20 ng / ml.</seg>
<seg id="1438">During the subsequent maintenance therapy of liver, kidney and heart transplants, blood concentrations in the range of 5 - 15 ng / ml were generally used.</seg>
<seg id="1439">This has led to serious adverse events, including graft rejection or other side effects that may occur as a result of tacrolimus or overexposure.</seg>
<seg id="1440">Patients should always maintain the same Tacrolimus formulation and the corresponding daily dosage; changes to the formulation or régime should only be carried out under close-meshed control of a physician experienced in the transplantation (see Sections 4.2 and 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="1441">5 In order to treat adult patients with graft rejection, which proved to be an immunosuppressive agent than other immunosuppressiva, no clinical data for the retarded formulation Advagraf are not yet available.</seg>
<seg id="1442">There are no clinical data for the retarded formulation of Advagraf for the prevention of graft rejection in adult heart transplants and transplant recipients in childhood.</seg>
<seg id="1443">Because of possible interactions which may lead to a reduction in the tacrolimus levels in the blood and a weakening of the clinical effect of tacrolimus, the intake of herbal supplements containing St. John's wort (Hypericum perforatum) or other plant remedies during treatment with advagraph (see Section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1444">Patients with diarrhoea have a particularly careful monitoring of the Tacrolimus concentrations in the blood, as the Tacrolimus blood levels can be subject to considerable variations in such circumstances.</seg>
<seg id="1445">In rare cases a chamber or septum hypertrophy called cardiomyopathy was observed under Prograf, which can therefore occur also under Advagraph.</seg>
<seg id="1446">Other factors that increase the risk of such clinical interference are an already existing heart disease, a treatment with corticosteroids, high blood pressure, kidney or liver dysfunctions, infections, fluid overloading and oedema.</seg>
<seg id="1447">As with other immunosuppressants, exposure to sunlight or UV light should be reduced due to the possible risk of malignant skin lesions by appropriate clothing or use of a sun protection agent with a high protection factor.</seg>
<seg id="1448">When patients taking Tacrolimus, symptoms of PRES like headaches, altered states of consciousness, convulsions and blurred vision, a radiological examination (e.g.</seg>
<seg id="1449">Since advagraf contains hard capsules, retarated, lactose, special caution is required in patients with rare hereditary galactose intolerance, lactase deficiency or glucose-galactose-malabsorption.</seg>
<seg id="1450">The simultaneous use of medicines or herbal remedies known as inhibitors or inductors of CYP3A4 can affect the metabolism of Tacrolimus and thus increase or decrease the blood levels of Tacrolimus.</seg>
<seg id="1451">It is therefore recommended to monitor the Tacrolimus levels while simultaneously offering substances that can alter the CYP3A metabolism and adjust the Tacrolimus dose for maintaining uniform concentrations (see Sections 4.2 and 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1452">A strongly pronounced interaction has been associated with antimykotika such as ketoconazole, fluconazol, ittraconazole and voriconazole as well as with the Macrolid antibiotic erythromycin and HIV protease inhibitors (z.</seg>
<seg id="1453">Pharmacokinetic studies showed that the increase in blood levels mainly results from the increased oral bioavailability of Tacrolimus due to the inhibition of gastrointestinal metabolism.</seg>
<seg id="1454">Highly dosed prednisolone or methylprednisolone, as used in acute rejection reactions, can increase or decrease the concentration of Tacrolimus in the blood.</seg>
<seg id="1455">Tacrolimus effect on the metabolism of other medicines Tacrolimus is known as CYP3A4 inhibitor; therefore, the simultaneous use of tacrolimus with medicines which are metabolized by CYP3A4 can affect their metabolism.</seg>
<seg id="1456">As tacrolimus can reduce the Clearance of steroid contraceptives and thus increase hormone levels, it is particularly prudent to proceed with decisions regarding contraceptive measures.</seg>
<seg id="1457">The results of animal studies have shown that tacrolimus can potentially reduce the clearance of pentobarbital and phenazone and can prolong their half-life.</seg>
<seg id="1458">The results of a small number of transplant patients have no indication that under tacrolimus, compared to other immunosuppressants, there is an increased risk of adverse events with regard to the course and outcome of pregnancy.</seg>
<seg id="1459">In utero exposure, a monitoring of the newborn is recommended for any adverse effects of tacrolimus (especially regarding its effects on the kidneys).</seg>
<seg id="1460">There is the risk of premature birth (&lt; week 37) and a hyperkalemia of the newborn (incidence 8 of 111 newborns), i.e.:</seg>
<seg id="1461">The side effect profile of immunosuppressiva can often not be determined precisely because of the size of the patient and the simultaneous treatment with a variety of other medicines.</seg>
<seg id="1462">In the following, the side effects are listed according to their frequency in descending order: very common (≥ 1 / 100, ≤ 1 / 100), occasionally (≥ 1 / 1000, ≤ 1 / 1000), very rare (≤ 1 / 10,000, ≤ 1 / 1000), very rare (frequency based on available data is not invaluable).</seg>

<seg id="1465">Infections and parasitic diseases such as other highly effective immunosuppressants are often increased in patients treated with tacrolimus, susceptibility to infections (viral, bacterial, mycotic, protozoa).</seg>
<seg id="1466">Cases of BK-Virus associated nephropathy and JC virus associated progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) were reported in patients under immunosuppression therapy, including therapy with advagraf.</seg>
<seg id="1467">It was reported about benign or malignant neoplasma including EBV- associated lymphoproliferative diseases and skin tumours in conjunction with the treatment with Tacrolimus.</seg>
<seg id="1468">Due to its high molecular weight, low water solubility and high binding of erythrocytes and plasma roteins, it can be assumed that tacrolimus is not dialyzable.</seg>
<seg id="1469">Mechanism of action and pharmacodynamic effects on a molecular level are likely to mediate the effects of tacrolimus through its binding to a cytosol protein (FKBP12), which is responsible for the enrichment of the link in the cell inns.</seg>
<seg id="1470">This leads to calciumdependent inhibition of signal transduction pathways in the T cell, thereby preventing the transcription of a certain number of lymphokin genes.</seg>
<seg id="1471">Tacrolimus suppresses the activation of T cells and the proliferation of B cells dependent on T-helper cells, further the formation of lymphocytes (such as interleukin-2, interleukin-3 and γ-interferon) as well as the expression of the interleukin-2 receptor.</seg>
<seg id="1472">12 confirmed acute rejection was 32.6% in the first 24 weeks of the Advance Group (N = 237) and in the Prograf Group (N = 234) 29.3%.</seg>
<seg id="1473">The survival rates after 12 months were 89.2% for Advagraf and 90,8% for Prograf; in the Advagraf arm 25 (14 women, 11 males) and the Prograf arm 24 (5 females, 19 men) died.</seg>
<seg id="1474">Kidney transplantation The efficacy and safety of Advagraf and Prograf was compared in combination with mycophenolatmofetil (MMF) and corticosteroids, 667 de novo kidney transplant recipients.</seg>
<seg id="1475">The survival rates after 12 months were 96.9% for Advagraf and 97.5% for Prograf; in the Advagraf arm 10 (3 females, 7 men) and the Prograf arm 8 (3 women, 5 men) died.</seg>
<seg id="1476">The efficacy and safety of Prograf, Ciclosporin and Advagraf was compared in combination with Basiliximab-antibody induction, MMF and corticosteroids, at 638 de novo kidney transplant recipients.</seg>
<seg id="1477">The incidence of therapy failure after 12 months (defined as death, transplant loss, biopsy-confirmed acute rejection or missing follow-up data) was 14.0% in the Prograf group (N = 212) and 17.0% in the Ciclosporin Group (N = 212).</seg>
<seg id="1478">The treatment difference was -3.0% (Advagraph Ciclosporin) (95.2% confidence interval [-9.9%, 4.0%]) for Advagraf vs Ciclosporin and -1.9% (Prograf Ciclosporin) (95.2% confidence interval [-8.9%, 5.2%]) for Prograf vs Ciclosporin.</seg>
<seg id="1479">In the Advagraf arm 3 (men), in the Prograf arm 10 (3 women, 7 men) and in the Ciclosporin arm 6 (3 women, 3 men) died.</seg>
<seg id="1480">Published results of primary immunosuppression with Tacrolimus in the form of Prograf taken twice daily after other primary organ transplants Prograf has become a recognised primary immunosuppressant following pancreatic, lung and intestinal transplants.</seg>
<seg id="1481">175 aggraft patients with 475 patients undergoing a pancreas transplant were used in 630 cases after an intestinal transplant as a primary immunosuppressant.</seg>
<seg id="1482">Overall, the safety profile of oral prograf in these published studies corresponded to the major studies in which Prograf was used to treat liver, kidney and heart transplants as primary immunosuppression.</seg>
<seg id="1483">Analysis of lung transplantation in an interim analysis of a recently conducted, multicenter study with oral prograf was reported to over 110 patients who received 1: 1 randomisation either Tacrolimus or Ciclosporin.</seg>
<seg id="1484">Chronic transplant rejection, the bronchiolitis of obliterative syndrome, was less frequent in the first year after transplantation (2.86% versus 8.57%).</seg>
<seg id="1485">The survival rate after one year was 80.8% in the Tacrolimus and 83% in the Ciclosporin Group (Treede et al., 3rd ICI San Diego, USA, 2004; Abstract 22).</seg>
<seg id="1486">Patients treated with Tacrolimus came to 21.7% of the cases to develop a bronchiolitis of obliterans compared to 38.0% in Ciclosporin (p = 0.025).</seg>
<seg id="1487">The number of cases in which Ciclosporin had to be changed to tacrolimus (n = 0.02) was significantly greater (p = 0.02) than the number of patients who were converted from Tacrolimus to Ciclosporin (n = 2) (Keenan et al., Ann Thoracic Surg 1995; 60: 580).</seg>
<seg id="1488">The number of cases in which there was no acute rejection was 6 months (57.7% versus 45.8%) and after 1 year (50% versus 33.3%) in the treatment transplanted patients of the Tacrolimus Group (Treede et al., J Heart Lung Transplant 2001; 20: 511).</seg>
<seg id="1489">In one study, the incidence of a bronchiolitis of obliterative syndrome in patients treated with Tacrolimus was significantly lower.</seg>
<seg id="1490">A multicenter study with oral prograf was performed on 205 patients undergoing a pancreatic and renal transplantation which, after a randomised procedure, received Tacrolimus (n = 103) or Ciclosporin (n = 102).</seg>
<seg id="1491">The oral initialdosage (via protocol) of Tacrolimus was 0.2 mg / kg / day and was subsequently reached for reaching the target level of 8 to 15 ng / ml of 5.</seg>
<seg id="1492">Intestinal transplant The published clinical results of a monocentric study with oral prograf as primary immunosuppressive after intestinal transplants showed an updated survival rate of 75% after 1 year, 5% after 5 years and 42% after 10 years.</seg>
<seg id="1493">Methods of early detection of Epstein-Barr (EBV) - and CMV infections, bone marital augmentation, additional administration of the interleukin-2 antagonist Daclizumab, lower initial doses of Tacrolimus, which lead to Talmirrors between 10 and 15 ng / ml and recently transplant radiation (Abu-Elmagd et al., Ann Surg 2001; 234: 404).</seg>
<seg id="1494">Factors such as a low haematocrit and low protein concentrations leading to an increase in the unbound fraction of Tacrolimus, or a strengthening of the metabolism caused by corticosteroids, should be responsible for the higher clearance rates observed after transplantation.</seg>
<seg id="1495">This suggests that Tacrolimus is almost completely metabolised before excretion, whereby the excretion occurs mainly via the bile.</seg>
<seg id="1496">The systemic exposure of Tacrolimus (AUC0-24) was approximately 10% lower than Prograf in stable patients (once daily) in relation 1: 1 (mg: mg) compared to the total daily dose.</seg>
<seg id="1497">It is recommended to carry out frequent checks of the Tacrolimus Talmirrors during the first two weeks after transplantation, followed by periodic checks during maintenance therapy.</seg>

<seg id="1530">Advice is used to treat and prevent bleeding in patients with haemophilia A (caused by the lack of factor VIII caused by congenital blood clotting disorder).</seg>
<seg id="1531">The dose and frequency of the application depend on whether it is used to treat bleeding or to prevent bleeding in surgical procedures.</seg>
<seg id="1532">Patients with haemophilia A suffer from a factor VIII deficiency, which causes blood clotting problems such as bleeding in joints, muscles or internal organs.</seg>
<seg id="1533">Octocog alfa is not extracted from human plasma but produced by a method called recombinant DNA technology:</seg>
<seg id="1534">It is produced by a cell in which a gene (DNA) was introduced that enables it to form the human cranial factor VIII.</seg>
<seg id="1535">Lawyers are similar to another in the European Union called Recombinate, but is made differently so that the medicine does not contain proteins of human or animal origin.</seg>
<seg id="1536">In three additional studies of patients with severe to moderate hemophilia A, including a study of 53 children under six years, the use of the drug was investigated for the prevention of bleeding and surgical procedures.</seg>
<seg id="1537">In the main study the efficacy of Advate in the prevention of bleeding in 86% of 510 new blood disease episodes was awarded with "excellent" or "good."</seg>
<seg id="1538">The most common side effects of lawyers (observed at 1 to 10 of 100 patients) are dizziness, headaches, pyrexia (fever) and the formation of antibodies against Factor VIII.</seg>
<seg id="1539">Lawyers may not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to the human coagulation factor VIII, mouse or hamster protein, or any of the other ingredients.</seg>
<seg id="1540">In March 2004, the European Commission issued a permit to the company Baxter AG for the placing of lawyers in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="1541">Dosage The dosage and duration of the substitution therapy depend on the severity of the Factor VIII deficiency, on the location and the extent of the bleeding and clinical condition of the patient.</seg>
<seg id="1542">In the following hemorrhagic events, the Factor VIII activity should not fall below the indicated plasma levels (in% of the standard or I.E. / dl).</seg>
<seg id="1543">Injection all 12-24 hours (8-24 hours in patients under 6 years) repeat for 3-4 days or longer until the pain and acute impairment are removed.</seg>
<seg id="1544">Injection all 8-24 hours (6-12 hours in patients under 6 years) repeat until the risk is over for the patient.</seg>
<seg id="1545">During the treatment course, appropriate determination of the Factor VIII plasma is recommended for the control of the dose and frequency of the injections.</seg>
<seg id="1546">Individual patients can differ in their reaction to Factor VIII, achieve different in vivo recovery and exhibit different half-times.</seg>
<seg id="1547">3 Prophylaxis for long-term prophylaxis of bleeding in patients with severe haemophilia A should be given doses between 20 and 40 I.U. of factor VIII per kg body weight at a distance of 2-3 days.</seg>
<seg id="1548">If the expected Factor VIII plasma activity is not reached or if the bleeding is not controlled with a reasonable dose, a test must be carried out in order to prove an inhibitor if necessary.</seg>
<seg id="1549">In patients with high inhibitor values, it is possible that the Factor VIII-therapy is not effective, so that other therapeutic measures must be considered.</seg>
<seg id="1550">The dosage speed should be directed after the patient is found, with a maximum injection rate of 10 ml / min not to be exceeded.</seg>
<seg id="1551">The formation of neutralizing antibodies against Factor VIII is a known complication in the treatment of patients with haemophilia A.</seg>
<seg id="1552">These inhibitors are always against the procoagulatory activity of factor VIII directed IgG immunoglobulins, which are quantified in Bethesda units (B.E.) per ml plasma using modified Bethesda Assay.</seg>
<seg id="1553">The risk of developing inhibitors correlates with the extent of exposure to Factor VIII, whereby risk within the first 20 expositions is the largest and depends on genetic and other factors.</seg>
<seg id="1554">In pre-treated patients (PTPs) with more than 100 repositional days and an amnestic known inhibitor development, after switching from a recombinant Factor VIII-product to another, the recurrence of (low-trigen) inhibitors was observed.</seg>
<seg id="1555">Due to the rare occurrence of haemophilia A among women, the use of Factor VIII during pregnancy and lactation is not an experience.</seg>
<seg id="1556">ADRs were inhibitors against Factor VIII (5 patients) who had a higher risk of inhibiting inhibitors, headaches (5 patients), fever and dizziness (3 patients each).</seg>
<seg id="1557">Very common (≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10), occasionally (≥ 1 / 1000 to &lt; 1 / 100), rarely (≥ 1 / 1000 to &lt; 1 / 1,000), rarely known (frequency based on available data cannot be estimated).</seg>
<seg id="1558">A) The percentage of patients was calculated on the basis of the sum of the individual patients (234). the unexpected drop in blood clotting factor VIII was observed postoperatively (10th - 14th postoperative day) in a patient under continuous ADVATE infusion.</seg>
<seg id="1559">Blood clotting was maintained throughout the period and both the Factor VIII- Mirror in the Plasma and the Clearance Rate again showed sufficient levels on the 15th postoperative day.</seg>
<seg id="1560">In clinical studies with ADVATE in 145 children and adults 2 with diagnosed severe to moderate hemophilia A (FVIII ≤ 2%) and previous exposure to Factor VIII concentrates (≥ 150 days) only one patient showed a low inhibitor (2.4 B.E. in modified Bethesda approach) after 26 expositions.</seg>
<seg id="1561">In addition, none of the 53 paediatric patients with an age of under 6 years and diagnosed severe to moderate hemophilia A (FVIII ≤ 2%) after previous exposure to Factor VIII- concentrates (≥ 50 days) found a FVIII inhibitor.</seg>
<seg id="1562">In previously untreated patients, 5 out of 25 (20%) patients treated with ADVATE were inhibitors against Factor VIII.</seg>
<seg id="1563">The immune response of patients to traces of contaminating proteins was analysed by investigating the antibody titers against these proteins, laboratory parameters and reported side effects.</seg>
<seg id="1564">One patient showed both a statistically significant upward trend as well as a sustained peak of the antibody-level against anti-CHO cell protein, otherwise there were no signs or symptoms that indicated an allergic reaction or hypersensitivity.</seg>
<seg id="1565">Four patients were reported to have reported on the occurrence of urticaria, pruritus, skin rash and increased number of eosinophiler granulocytes in several repeated product expositions within the study.</seg>
<seg id="1566">7 As with other intravenous products, ADVATE reports hypersensitivity reactions of the allergic type, including anaphylactic / anaphylactoides reactions (frequency not known).</seg>

<seg id="1638">Based on the data available since the initial authorisation, the CHMP has continued to evaluate the benefit-risk assessment as positive, but considered that the safety profile must be closely monitored for the following reasons:</seg>
<seg id="1639">Therefore, on the basis of the safety profile of ADVATE, which necessitates a filing of PSURs every 6 months, the CHMP decided that the authorisation holder should apply for another extension procedure in 5 years.</seg>
<seg id="1640">In December 2008, Gendux Molecular Limited announced that the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) officially announced that the company will withdraw its application for the Advexin placing on the market for the treatment of Li-Fraumeni cancer.</seg>
<seg id="1641">Normally, however, the breast, the brain, the bones or the soft tissues (tissues that bind, surround and support other structures in the body) are affected.</seg>
<seg id="1642">This is a type of virus that has been genetically modified to carry a gene into the cells of the body.</seg>
<seg id="1643">The virus in Advexin is a "Adenovirus," which has been modified in such a way that it cannot produce copies of itself and thus cannot trigger infections in humans.</seg>
<seg id="1644">Advexin could have been injected directly into the tumours and thus enable the cancer cells to re-form the normal p53 protein.</seg>
<seg id="1645">The p53 protein produced from the p53 gene existing in the human body normally contributes to the recovery of damaged DNA and to kill cells when DNA cannot be restored.</seg>
<seg id="1646">At Li-Fraumeni-Cancer, where the p53 gene is defective, the p53 protein does not work properly, and the cancer cells can continue to grow and divide.</seg>
<seg id="1647">The company presented data from a study with a patient with Li-Fraumeni cancer in the underbelly area, bone and brain.</seg>
<seg id="1648">After the CHMP tested the company's answers to the questions he asked, some questions were still unclear.</seg>
<seg id="1649">Based on the examination of the initially submitted documents, the CHMP created a list of questions sent to the company on day 120.</seg>
<seg id="1650">According to the CHMP, it was not sufficiently proven that Advexin Injection in Li-Fraumeni tumours will benefit patients.</seg>
<seg id="1651">The committee also had concerns regarding the treatment of the drug in the body, the type of administration and the safety of the drug.</seg>
<seg id="1652">In addition, the company has not sufficiently demonstrated that Advexin can be manufactured in a reliable manner and that it is harmful to the environment or for people who come in close contact with the patient.</seg>
<seg id="1653">The company did not inform the CHMP whether the withdrawal consequences for patients currently participating in clinical trials or "re-use use" programs with advexin.</seg>
<seg id="1654">"changed substance release" means that the tablets are composed in such a way that one of the effective ingredients is released immediately and the other slowly over a few hours.</seg>
<seg id="1655">Aerinaze is used to treat the symptoms of seasonal allergic rhinitis (hay fever, inflammation of the nasal pathways caused by allergy to pollen) in patients with nasal mucosal swelling (clogged nose).</seg>
<seg id="1656">For adults and adolescents under 12 years of age, the recommended dose of aerinaze is twice daily a tablet, which should be taken with a glass of water with or without food.</seg>
<seg id="1657">The duration of the treatment should be as short as possible and terminated as soon as the symptoms, especially swelling of the nasal mucosa (clogged nose), are cluttered.</seg>
<seg id="1658">A treatment duration of more than 10 days is not recommended because the effects of the drug can be reduced to the constipation of the nose.</seg>
<seg id="1659">The main efficacy measures were the changes in the severity of the hay fever symptoms reported by the patients before the treatment and during the 15-day treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1660">During the study, patients had their symptoms every 12 hours in a diary and assessed with a standard scale, how difficult the symptoms were in the last 12 hours.</seg>
<seg id="1661">In examining all hay fever symptoms except the constipation of the nose, patients reported that the aerinaze received a decrease in symptoms by 46.0%, compared to 35.9% in patients receiving pseudoephedrine alone.</seg>
<seg id="1662">If only the swelling of the nasal mucosa was seen, the patients under Aerinaze showed a reduction in symptoms by 37.4% compared to 26.7% in patients who had lost Desloratadin alone.</seg>
<seg id="1663">The most common side effects of aerinaze (observed at 1 to 10 of 100 patients) are tachycardia, mouth dry, dizziness, psychomotor hyperactivity (restlessness), constipation, headache, fatigue, insomnia (sleeplessness), somnolence (sleepiness), sleep disorders and nervousness.</seg>
<seg id="1664">Aerinaze may not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to desloratadin, pseudoephedrine or any of the other ingredients against adrenergic agents or Loratadin (another drug for the treatment of allergies).</seg>
<seg id="1665">Aerinaze may also not be used in patients who suffer from a narrow angle glaucoma (increased intraocular pressure), cardiac or vascular diseases including hypertension (hypertension), hyperthyroiosis (hyperthyrophy) or a haemorrhagic stroke (caused by cerebral haemorrhage) or have a risk of haemorrhagic stroke.</seg>
<seg id="1666">On 30 July 2007, the European Commission issued a permit to the company SP Europe for the transport of aerinaze across the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="1667">The tablet can be taken with a glass of water, but is swallowed whole (i.e. without debiting, breaking or chewing).</seg>
<seg id="1668">Due to the absence of data on safety and efficacy (see Section 5.1), Aerinaze should not be used in children under 12 years of age.</seg>
<seg id="1669">The duration of the application is as short as possible and should not be continued after the symptoms are finished.</seg>
<seg id="1670">It is recommended to limit the duration of application to 10 days, as the activity of pseudoephedrine may decrease with time.</seg>
<seg id="1671">After the swelling of the mucous membranes in the upper respiratory tract, the treatment can be continued as a monotherapy if necessary.</seg>
<seg id="1672">As Aerinaze contains pseudoephedrine, the medicine is also contraindicated in patients who are treated with a monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitor or within 2 weeks of termination of such therapy.</seg>
<seg id="1673">This is due to alphamimetic activity in combined use of pseudoephedrine with other vasoconstrictors such as bromocripitin, pergolid, Lisurid, Cabergoline, ergotamine, Dihydroergotamine or other deonteotikum (phenylpropanol, ephedrine, oxymetazoline, naphazolin, etc.).</seg>
<seg id="1674">The safety and efficacy of this combination therapy were not tested for this patient collective and the data is insufficient to address appropriate dosage recommendations.</seg>
<seg id="1675">The safety and efficacy of aerinaze were not tested in patients with kidney or liver dysfunctions and the data do not suffice to address appropriate dosage recommendations.</seg>
<seg id="1676">Patients must be informed that treatment in case of hypertension or tachycardia or palpitations, cardiac arrhythmias, nausea, or any other neurological symptoms (such as headaches or a gain of headaches) must be removed.</seg>
<seg id="1677">The treatment of the following patient groups is recommended: • Patients with cardiac arrhythmias • Patients with heart rhythm disorders • Patients with hypertension • Patients with a myocardial infarction in anamnesis, diabetes mellitus, bladder neck, or bronchospasm in anamnesis.</seg>
<seg id="1678">Aerinaze is to be discontinued at least 48 hours prior to the carrying out of dermatological tests, as antihistamines are otherwise able to prevent or reduce positive reactions to indicators for skin reactions.</seg>
<seg id="1679">In the context of clinical trials with desloratadin, in which erythromycin or ketoconazole were administered in addition, no clinically relevant interactions or changes in plasma concentrations of desloratadin were observed.</seg>
<seg id="1680">In the results of the psychomotor testing no significant differences could be found between patients treated with discoatadin and placebo-treated patients regardless of whether it was taken alone or with alcohol.</seg>
<seg id="1681">The enzyme responsible for the metabolism of the dechlorate adin has not yet been identified, so that interactions with other medicines cannot be completely ruled out.</seg>
<seg id="1682">In vitro studies have shown that the CYP2D6 does not inhibit CYP2D6 and is neither a substrate nor an inhibitor of the P-glycoproteins.</seg>
<seg id="1683">The harmlessness of the use of aerinaze during pregnancy is not guaranteed, but experiences from a large number of affected pregnancies however did not increase the frequency of abnormalities compared to the frequency of the normal population.</seg>
<seg id="1684">Since reproductive studies on animals are not always transmitted to humans and due to the vasoconstrictive properties of pseudoephedrine, aerinaze should not be used during pregnancy.</seg>
<seg id="1685">However, patients should be informed that in very rare cases it may result in a dizziness that may lead to impairment of transport or the ability to operate machines.</seg>
<seg id="1686">Symptoms may vary between a CNS-depression (sedation, apnea, mental alertness, cyanosis, coma, cardiovascular collapse) and a CNS stimulation (insomnia, hallucinations, tremor, convulsions) with possible lettuces.</seg>
<seg id="1687">Headache, anxiety, scary miction, muscle weakness and increased muscle tension, euphoria, arousal, respiratory failure, cardiac arrhythmia, tachycardia, palpitations, thirst, transpiration, nausea, vomiting, preventive pain, dizziness, tinnitus, ataxia, blurred vision and hypotony.</seg>
<seg id="1688">A CNS stimulation is most likely in children, as well as atropine-typical symptoms (dry mouth, pupillary starre and - dilatation, skin redness, hyperthermia, and gastrointestinal symptoms).</seg>
<seg id="1689">These include inhibiting the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-4, IL-6, IL-8 and IL-13 from human mast cells / basophiles as well as the inhibition of the expression of the adhesion molecules P selector to endothelial cells.</seg>
<seg id="1690">In a single dose trial with adults, Desloratadin 5 mg did not show any influence on standard measurement variables of the flight performance, including the reinforcement of subjective sleepiness or the tasks associated with flying.</seg>
<seg id="1691">In controlled clinical trials no increased frequency of somnolence compared to placebo was observed at the recommended dosage of 5 mg daily.</seg>
<seg id="1692">The oral application of pseudoephedrine in the recommended dosage can cause other sympathetic effects, such as an increase in blood pressure, tachycardia or manifestations of CNS excitation.</seg>
<seg id="1693">1,248 patients aged between 12 and 78 took part in seasonal allergic rhinitis, with 414 patients receiving aerinaze tablets.</seg>
<seg id="1694">In both studies the histamine-antagonistic efficacy of aerinaze tablets was significantly higher compared to the overall score for the symptoms (except nasal mucosal swelling), significantly higher than under a monotherapy with pseudoephedrine over the 2-week treatment period.</seg>
<seg id="1695">The efficacy of aerinaze tablets with regard to the swelling effect, determined by the nasal mucosal swelling, was significantly higher than under a monotherapy with desloratadin over the 2-week treatment period.</seg>
<seg id="1696">The effectiveness of the aerinaze tablets showed no significant differences regarding gender, age or ethnicity.</seg>
<seg id="1697">As part of a single dose trial for pharmacokinetics of aerinaze, dechlorate adin is detectable within 30 minutes after administration in the plasma.</seg>
<seg id="1698">After the peroral application of aerinaze in healthy subjects over 14 days, the floating equilibrium of Desloratadin, 3-Hydroxydesloratadin and Pseudoephedrine was reached on day 10.</seg>
<seg id="1699">In the context of a pharmacokinetic multiple dose study, which was carried out with the formulation as a tablet in healthy adult subjects, it was found that four subjects were poorly metabolism.</seg>
<seg id="1700">A component interaction study shows that the exposure (Cmax and AUC) of pseudoephedrine, after the sole dispensation of pseudoephedrine, was equivalent to the exposure of an aerosze tablet.</seg>
<seg id="1701">Based on conventional studies on safety harmacology, toxicity in repeated application, genotoxicity and reproductive toxicity, the preclinical data with Desloratadin do not reveal any particular dangers to humans.</seg>
<seg id="1702">The combination had no greater toxicity than its individual components, and the observed effects were generally associated with the ingredient pseudoephedrine.</seg>
<seg id="1703">In reproductive toxicological studies the combination of Loratadin / pseudoephedrine was not teratogenic in a dose of up to 150 mg / kg / day and to rabbits in a dose of up to 120 mg / kg / day.</seg>
<seg id="1704">March 2007 and in Module 1.8.1 of the admission application described pharmacovigilance system is established and works before and while the product is on the market.</seg>
<seg id="1705">Antihistaminika contribute to the relief of allergic symptoms by preventing histamine, a body's substance, its effect.</seg>
<seg id="1706">Aerinaze tablets alleviate symptoms associated with seasonal allergic rhinitis (hay fever) such as sneezing, running or itching nose and tears or itching eyes while constipating the nose.</seg>

<seg id="1709">Inform your doctor if you are experiencing or diagnosing the following symptoms or diseases when using Aerinaze: • High blood pressure • Cardiovascular disorders • nausea and headaches, or strengthening existing headaches.</seg>
<seg id="1710">If you are taking any medicinal products with other medicines, please inform your doctor or pharmacist if you are using other medicines or have recently taken it, even if it is not prescription medicine.</seg>
<seg id="1711">When applying in the recommended dosage, it is not to be expected that aerinaze leads to dizziness or reduces the attention.</seg>
<seg id="1712">If you have taken a larger amount of aerinaze than you ought to immediately inform your doctor or pharmacist if you have taken a larger amount of aerinaze than you ought to.</seg>
<seg id="1713">If you forget to take an aerosze dose if you forgot to take a dose in time, take the application as soon as possible and apply the next dose at the appropriate time.</seg>

<seg id="1717">After the market launch of Desloratadin very rarely was reported about cases of severe allergic reactions (shortness of breath, whistling breathing, itching, hives and swelling) or skin rash.</seg>
<seg id="1718">Cases of heart palpitations, heart chasing, abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, stomach upset, diarrhea, hallucinations, dizziness, drowsiness, somnia, muscle pain, seizures, restlessness with increased physical activity, over cases of inflammation of the liver and over cases of conspicuous liver values has also been reported very rarely.</seg>
<seg id="1719">It is available as 5 mg tablet, 5 mg lyophilisat for intake (soluble tablet), 2.5 mg and 5 mg of melting tablets (tablets that dissolve in the mouth), 0.5 mg / ml syrup and as 0.5 mg / ml solution for intake.</seg>
<seg id="1720">For children aged one to five years, the dose is 1.25 mg once daily, which is in the form of 2.5 ml syrup or syrup.</seg>
<seg id="1721">For children aged six to eleven, the dose is 2.5 mg once a day, either in the form of 5 ml syrup or syrup.</seg>
<seg id="1722">Aerius was studied in eight studies of about 4 800 adults and adolescents with allergic rhinitis (including four trials of seasonal allergic rhinitis and two studies on patients who also had asthma).</seg>
<seg id="1723">Efficacy was measured by investigating the symptoms (itching, number and size of the quadrants, impairment of sleep and performance on the day) before and after six weeks of treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1724">Further studies have been submitted to demonstrate that the body uses the syrup, the solution for inhaling and melting tablets in the same way as the tablets and the application in children is harmless.</seg>
<seg id="1725">In the case of allergic rhinitis, when the results of all studies were taken together, the two-week treatment with 5 mg Aerius resulted in an average decrease in symptom scores (symptom scores) by 25 to 32%, compared to the decrease of 12 to 26% in patients receiving placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1726">In both studies at Urticaria, the decrease in symptom scores after six weeks of treatment with Aerius 58 and 67%, compared with 40 and 33% in patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1727">Aerius may not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to Desloratadin, Loratadin or any of the other ingredients.</seg>
<seg id="1728">In January 2001, the European Commission issued a permit to the company SP Europe for the transport of Aerius throughout the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="1729">One tablet once a day, with or without a meal, to relieve symptoms of allergic rhinitis (including intermittent and persistent allergic rhinitis) and urticaria (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1730">There is limited experience from clinical studies of efficacy in the application of dechloratadin in adolescents from 12 to 17 years (see Sections 4.8 and 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1731">The treatment of the allergic rhinitis (occurrence of symptoms for less than 4 days a week or less than 4 weeks) should be carried out according to the course of the disease and can be resumed following the sound of the symptoms and resumed with their recurrence.</seg>
<seg id="1732">In case of persisting allergic rhinitis (occurrence of symptoms to 4 or more days a week and more than 4 weeks), the patient can be recommended during the allergy period.</seg>
<seg id="1733">Clinically relevant interactions were not found in the context of clinical studies with Desloratadin tablets where erythromycin or ketoconazole were administered in addition (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1734">In a clinical pharmacological study, the performance of alcohol was not increased while taking Aerius and alcohol (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1735">However, patients should be informed that in very rare cases it can come to dizziness which may lead to impairment of traffic or the ability to operate machines.</seg>
<seg id="1736">In clinical trials in various indications including allergic rhinitis and chronic idiopathic urticaria, the recommended dose of 5 mg daily reported 3% more side effects in patients with Aerius than those treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1737">The most common adverse events reported more frequently than placebo were fatigue (1.2%), dry mouth (0.8%) and headache (0.6%).</seg>
<seg id="1738">In a clinical study involving 578 young patients aged between 12 and 17, the most common side effect was headaches; this occurred in 5.9% of patients treated with discoatadin and 6.9% of patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1739">No clinically relevant effects were observed in a multi-dose trial, which was administered up to 45 mg of desloratadin (nine-fold clinical dose).</seg>
<seg id="1740">This includes inhibiting the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-4, IL-6, IL-8 and IL-13 from human mast cells / basophiles as well as the inhibition of the expression of the adhesion molecules P selector to endothelial cells.</seg>
<seg id="1741">In the context of a clinical study with multiple doses administered in a dose of up to 20 mg daily for 14 days, no statistically significant or clinically relevant cardiovascular effect was described.</seg>
<seg id="1742">In a clinical pharmacological study, in which desloratadin was administered in a dose of 45 mg daily (which was nine times the clinical dose) over ten days, no extension of the Qtc interval was observed.</seg>
<seg id="1743">In a single dose-study with adults, Desloratadin 5 mg did not show any influence on standard measurement variables of the flight performance, including the reinforcement of subjective sleepiness or the tasks associated with flying.</seg>
<seg id="1744">In patients with allergic rhinitis, Aerius was effective in relieving symptoms such as sneezing, nasal secretion and itching of the nose, itching, tears of tears and redness of the eyes as well as itching on the palate.</seg>
<seg id="1745">In addition to the established classification in seasonally and perennial, allergic rhinitis may also be divided into intermittent allergic rhinitis and persisting allergic rhinitis depending on the duration of the symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="1746">Intermittent allergic rhinitis is defined as the occurrence of symptoms for less than 4 days a week or less than 4 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="1747">Persisting allergic rhinitis is defined as the occurrence of symptoms to 4 or more days a week and more than 4 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="1748">As demonstrated by the overall score of the questionnaire on quality of life in Rhino-conjunctivitis, Aerius effectively reduces the strain caused by seasonal allergic rhinitis.</seg>
<seg id="1749">The chronically idiopathic urticaria was investigated as a substitute for further forms of urticaria, because the underlying pathophysiology, regardless of the etiology, is similar in the different forms and chronic patients can be recruited simply prospectively.</seg>
<seg id="1750">Since histaminfancy is a causative factor in all urticaria diseases, it is expected that in other forms of urticaria, in other forms of urticaria, Desloratadin will also improve the symptoms; this is confirmed by the recommendations of the clinical guidelines.</seg>
<seg id="1751">In two placebo-controlled trials over 6 weeks in patients with chronic idiopathic urticaria, Aerius was effective in improving the uritus and the reduction of size and number of squares at the end of the first dose interval.</seg>
<seg id="1752">As in other studies with antihistaminika in chronic idiopathic urticaria the minority of patients who did not react to antihistamines were excluded from the study.</seg>
<seg id="1753">Improvement of the itching rate by more than 50% was observed in 55% of patients treated with discoatadin compared to 19% of patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1754">Treatment with Aerius significantly reduced the disturbance of sleep and wakefulness as measured by a 4-point scale for evaluating these variables.</seg>
<seg id="1755">In a pharmacokinetic study, in which patients with the general seasonal allergic rhinitis population were comparable, 4% of patients achieved a higher concentration of Desloratadin.</seg>
<seg id="1756">There are no indications for clinically relevant cumulation after once daily use of diloratadin (5- 20 mg) for 14 days.</seg>
<seg id="1757">However, the enzyme responsible for the metabolism of the dechlorate adin has not yet been identified, so that interactions with other medicines are not completely eliminated.</seg>
<seg id="1758">Neither CYP3A4 and in-vitro studies have shown that the CYP2D6 does not inhibit CYP2D6 and is neither a substrate nor an inhibitor of the P-glycoproteins.</seg>
<seg id="1759">In a single dose study with Desloratadin in a dose of 7.5 mg meals (fatty, calorie rich breakfast) did not affect the availability of Desloratadin.</seg>
<seg id="1760">The preclinical studies conducted with Desloratadin and Loratadin showed no qualitative or quantitative differences regarding the toxicity profile of Desloratadin and Loratadin.</seg>
<seg id="1761">Based on conventional studies on safety harmacology, toxicity in repeated application, genotoxicity and reproductive toxicity, the preclinical data with Desloratadin do not reveal any particular dangers to humans.</seg>
<seg id="1762">Coloured film (contains lactose-monohydrate, hygroless, titanium dioxide, Macrogol 400, Indigo carmine (E 132)), colourless film (contains Hypostulate, Macrogol 400), carnauba wax, bleached wax.</seg>
<seg id="1763">Aerius can be taken independently of meals to relieve symptoms of allergic rhinitis (including intermittent and persistent allergic rhinitis) and urticaria (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1764">The prescribing physician should be aware that most cases of rhinitis in children under 2 years are caused by an infection (see section 4.4) and that there are no data that support a treatment of infectious rhinitis with Aerius.</seg>
<seg id="1765">In addition to the exclusion of upper respiratory tract infections or anatomical anomalies, anamnesis, physical examinations and appropriate laboratory and skin examinations should play a role in the diagnosis.</seg>
<seg id="1766">About 6% of adults and children aged between 2 and 11 are metabolizing dechlorate adin and experiencing a higher exposure to substance (see section 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="1767">The safety of Aerius syrup in children between 2 and 11 years that are metabolized is identical to those in children who are normal metabolising.</seg>
<seg id="1768">This drug contains sucrose and sorbitol; therefore, patients with hereditary problems of fructose intolerance, glucose-galactose adsorption or sucrose-isomaltas- failure should not take this medicine.</seg>
<seg id="1769">Clinically relevant interactions were not found in clinical studies with Aerius tablets where erythromycin or ketoconazole were administered in addition (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1770">In a clinical pharmacological study, the performance of alcohol was not increased while taking Aerius tablets and alcohol (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1771">The overall incidence of adverse events in children aged between 2 and 11 was similar to the placebo group in the Aerius Sirup Group.</seg>
<seg id="1772">In clinical studies with adults and adolescents in various indications, including allergic rhinitis and chronic idiopathic urticaria, the recommended dose reported 3% more side effects in patients with Aerius than those treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1773">No clinically relevant effects were observed in a multi-dose trial for adults and adolescents who administered up to 45 mg of desloratadin (nine-fold clinical dose).</seg>
<seg id="1774">Children between 1 and 11 years of age who came into question for an antihistamine therapy received a daily dietary supplement of 1.25 mg (between 1 and 5 years) or 2.5 mg (aged between 6 and 11 years).</seg>
<seg id="1775">Because the course of allergic rhinitis / chronic idiopathic urticaria and the profile of desloratadin are similar in adults and children, the efficacy data of dechlorate adin in adults can be extrapolated to the children's population.</seg>
<seg id="1776">In the context of a clinical study with multiple doses of adults and adolescents, in which Desloratadin was used in a dosage of up to 20 mg daily for 14 days, no statistically significant or clinically relevant cardiovascular effect was described.</seg>
<seg id="1777">In a clinical pharmacological study of adults and adolescents, in which Desloratadin was used in a dose of 45 mg daily (which was nine times the clinical dose) for ten days in adults, no extension of the Qtc interval showed.</seg>
<seg id="1778">In controlled clinical trials, no increased frequency of somnolence compared to placebo was observed at the recommended dosage of 5 mg daily for adults and adolescents.</seg>
<seg id="1779">At a single daily dose of 7.5 mg, Aerius tablets did not interfere with psychomotor disorders in adults and adolescents in clinical studies.</seg>
<seg id="1780">Clinically pharmacological studies in adults occurred due to the simultaneous intake of alcohol, neither to increase the alcohol-induced impairment of performance nor to increase drowsiness.</seg>
<seg id="1781">In adult and adolescent patients with allergic rhinitis, Aerius tablets were effective in relieving symptoms such as sneezing, nasal secretion and itching of the nose, itching, tears of tears and redness of the eyes as well as itching on the palate.</seg>
<seg id="1782">As shown on the basis of the overall score of the questionnaire on quality of life in Rhino-conjunctivitis, Aerius tablets effectively reduce the caused by seasonal allergic rhinitis</seg>
<seg id="1783">In two placebo-controlled trials over 6 weeks in patients with chronic idiopathic urticaria, Aerius was effective in improving the uritus and the reduction of size and number of squares at the end of the first dose interval.</seg>
<seg id="1784">The spread of this limited-metabolizing phenotype was comparable to adults (6%) and children between 2 and 11 years (6%) and in both populations larger in black (18% adults, 16% children) than in Caucasians (2% adults, 3% children).</seg>
<seg id="1785">Similar pharmacokinetic parameters were observed in a pharmacokinetic multidose study with the syrup formulation of children between 2 and 11 years with allergic rhinitis, which are restricted by limited metabolism.</seg>
<seg id="1786">The burden (AUC) by Desloratadin was about 6 times higher after 3 to 6 hours and the Cmax approximately 3 to 4 times higher with a terminale half-time of about 120 hours.</seg>
<seg id="1787">There are no indications for clinically relevant active ingredients accumulation after once daily use of discoatadin (5- 20 mg) for 14 days in adults and adolescents.</seg>
<seg id="1788">12 In various single dose trials, AUC and Cmax values of Desloratadin in pediatric patients were comparable with recommended doses with those of adults who received desloratadin syrup in a dose of 5 mg.</seg>
<seg id="1789">However, the enzyme responsible for the metabolism of the dechlorate adin has not yet been identified, so that interactions with other medicines cannot be completely ruled out.</seg>

<seg id="1811">The efficacy and safety of Aerius 2.5 mg of melting tablets in the treatment of children under 6 years have not been proven so far.</seg>
<seg id="1812">The overall frequency of adverse events between the disco-adine syrup and placebo group was the same and did not differ significantly from the safety profile established in adult patients.</seg>
<seg id="1813">At the recommended dose, Aerius enamel tablets proved to be a bioequivalent to the Aerius 5 mg of conventional tablets formulation and the Aerius 5 mg lyophilisate to be engaged in formulating desloratadin.</seg>
<seg id="1814">In the context of a clinical study with multiple doses administered in a dose of up to 20 mg daily for 14 days, no statistically significant or clinically significant effect was observed.</seg>
<seg id="1815">In a single dose trial with adults, Desloratadin 5 mg did not show any influence on standard measurement variables of the flight performance, including the reinforcement of subjective sleepiness or the tasks associated with flying.</seg>
<seg id="1816">The spread of this poorly metabolizing phenotype was comparable to adult (6%) and paediatric patients between 2 and 11 years (6%), and under black (adults 18%, children 16%), the safety profile of these patients, however, was not different from that of the general population.</seg>
<seg id="1817">In single dose crossover studies of Aerius melting tablets with Aerius 5 mg of conventional tablets or Aerius 5 mg lyophilisat, the formulations were bioequivalent.</seg>
<seg id="1818">Aerius 2.5 mg tablets were not studied in pediatric patients, but in combination with dose-finding studies in children, pharmacokinetic data for Aerius melting tablets support the use of 2.5 mg dosage in children from 6 to 11 years.</seg>
<seg id="1819">Food has no significant influence on AUC and Cmax from Aerius Aerius Lyophilisat, while food Tmax of Desloratadin is extended from 2.5 to 4 hours and Tmax of 3-OH- desloratadin from 4 to 6 hours.</seg>

<seg id="1893">June 2008 Novartis Vaccines and Diagnostics S.r.l. announced that the Committee for Medicinal Products for Medicinal Products (CHMP) officially announced that the company will withdraw its application for the introduction of Aflunov for the prevention of aviar H5N1 influenza in adults and older people.</seg>
<seg id="1894">Aflunov should be used in adults and older people to protect against influenza caused by the strain (type) H5N1 of the influenza A virus.</seg>
<seg id="1895">This is a special kind of vaccine that is intended to protect against a strain of the flu virus that could cause a future pandemic.</seg>
<seg id="1896">A flu pandemic breaks out when a new strain of the flu virus appears, which can easily spread from man to man, because humans have not yet built up immunity (no protection) against it.</seg>
<seg id="1897">Following the addition of the vaccine, the immune system recognises the parts of the flu virus that are contained in the vaccine as "foreign" and forms antibodies against it.</seg>
<seg id="1898">As a result, the immune system will later be able to produce antibodies with a flu virus in contact with a flu virus.</seg>
<seg id="1899">Subsequently, the membrane envelope of the virus was purified with the "surface antigens" (proteins on the membrane surface, which the human body recognizes as a body alien), purified and used as a constituent of the vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="1900">A survey of some of the study centres showed that the study was not carried out according to the "good clinical practice" (GCP).</seg>
<seg id="1901">As a result, the scope of the clinical data base for evaluating the safety of the vaccine was not sufficient to meet the requirements of the EMEA guidelines for pandemic vaccines.</seg>
<seg id="1902">If you are taking part in a clinical trial and require further information on your treatment, please contact your attending physician.</seg>
<seg id="1903">If you would like more information on the basis of the CHMP recommendations, please read the scientific discussion (also part of the EPAR).</seg>
<seg id="1904">It is used in combination with other antiviral medicines to treat adults and children over four years, which are infected with the human immunodeficiency virus of type 1 (HIV-1), which causes the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS).</seg>
<seg id="1905">For patients who cannot swallow the capsules, asgenerase is available as a solution for intake, but this cannot be taken together with kritonavir, as the safety of this combination has not been studied.</seg>
<seg id="1906">Asshrease should only be prescribed when the doctor has examined which antiviral drugs the patient has previously taken, and the likelihood that the virus is addressed to the drug.</seg>
<seg id="1907">The recommended dose for patients over twelve years is 600 mg twice daily, which are taken together with twice daily 100 mg of Ritonavir and with other antiviral medicines.</seg>
<seg id="1908">For children between four and twelve years and in patients with a body weight of less than 50 kg, the recommended dose of asenase depends on body weight.</seg>
<seg id="1909">In combination with other antiviral medicines, aspartase reduces the amount of HIV in the blood and keeps it at a low level.</seg>
<seg id="1910">Unable to cure AIDS, however, can delay the damage of the immune system and thus also the development of infections and diseases associated with AIDS.</seg>
<seg id="1911">Agenerase was studied in combination with other antiviral medicines, but without Ritonavir, in two main studies with 736 HIV-infected adults who had previously not been treated with protease inhibitors.</seg>
<seg id="1912">The high-dose Ritonavir increased drug azienase was compared to other protease inhibitors in 206 adults who used protease inhibitors earlier.</seg>
<seg id="1913">The main indicator of efficacy was the proportion of patients with non-detectable levels of HIV in the blood (viral load) or the viral load changes after treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1914">In the studies with patients who had previously not taken protease inhibitors, after 48 weeks under Agenerase more patients had a viral load of less than 400 copies / ml than placebo, but Agenerase was less effective than indinavir.</seg>
<seg id="1915">In children, the virus also decreased the viral load, but only very few of the children who had previously been treated with protease inhibitors were very few in response to the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1916">In the study with adults who had previously been treated with protease inhibitors, the drug Agenerase strengthened the viral load after 16-week treatment as effective as other protease inhibitors:</seg>
<seg id="1917">In the patients with HIV, which was resistant to four other protease inhibitors, there was a greater decrease of the viral load after four weeks with Ritonavir compared to the patients receiving their previous protease inhibitors:</seg>
<seg id="1918">The most common side effects of Agenerase (observed in more than 1 of 10 patients) are headaches, diarrhoea (diarrhea), flatulence (flatulence), nausea, vomiting, rash and Fatigue (fatigue).</seg>
<seg id="1919">2 / 3 Aenase may not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to amprenavir or any of the other ingredients.</seg>
<seg id="1920">Aspartase can also not be used in patients who take St. John's wort (a herbal supplement for the treatment of depression) or medicines that are broken down just like aspartase and are harmful to health in high concentrations in the blood.</seg>
<seg id="1921">As with other drugs against HIV, the risk of lipodystrophy (changes in body fat distribution), osteoarthritis (death of bone tissue) or an immune activation syndrome (symptoms of an infection caused by the restful immune system).</seg>
<seg id="1922">The Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) concluded that the benefits of asgenase in combination with other antiretroviral medicines were outweighed for the treatment of HIV-1 infected adults and children over four years.</seg>
<seg id="1923">Agenerase is usually taken together with the pharmacokinetic amplifier Ritonavir, but the committee found that the benefits of asgenase in combination with kritonavir in patients who have previously not taken protease inhibitors are not proven.</seg>
<seg id="1924">Agenerase was originally licensed under "extraordinary circumstances" as only limited information was provided at the time of approval for scientific reasons.</seg>
<seg id="1925">In October 2000, the European Commission issued a permit to Glaxo Group Limited for the placing on the market of Agenerase in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="1926">Asenase is indicated in combination with other antiretroviral medicines to treat HIV-1 infected, protease inhibitors (PI) -treated adults and children over 4 years.</seg>
<seg id="1927">Usually asenase capsules should be given to the pharmacokinetic boosting of amprenavir along with low doses of kritonavir (see Sections 4.2 and 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1928">The use of amprenavir should be carried out taking into account the individual viral resistance pattern and the pretreatment of the patient (see Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1929">The bioavailability of amprenavir as a solution to intake is 14% lower than amprenavir as capsule; therefore, asenase capsules and solution for intake on one milligram per milligram base are not interchangeable (see Section 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="1930">The recommended dose for asenase capsules is 600 mg of amprenavir twice daily along with 100 mg of Ritonavir twice daily in combination with other antiretroviral medicines.</seg>
<seg id="1931">2 If asenoid capsules are applied without the increased added of kritonavir (boosting), higher doses of asenase (1200 mg twice daily) must be applied.</seg>
<seg id="1932">The recommended dose for asenase capsules is 20 mg of amprenavir / kg body weight twice daily in combination with other antiretroviral medicines up to a daily dose of 2400 mg of amprenavir which should not be exceeded (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1933">The pharmacokinetics, efficacy and safety of asenase in combination with low doses of kritonavir or other protease inhibitors were not examined in children.</seg>
<seg id="1934">Asenase is not recommended for use in children under 4 years of age, due to lack of data on safety and effectiveness (see Section 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="1935">Based on pharmacokinetic data, the dose of asenase in adult patients with moderate liver function disorder should be reduced to 450 mg twice daily and in patients with severe liver dysfunctions to 300 mg twice daily.</seg>
<seg id="1936">The simultaneous application should be conducted with caution in patients with mild or moderate liver dysfunction, in patients with severe liver dysfunction, they are contraindicated (see Section 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="1937">Asgenera must not be given at the same time with medicines which have a low therapeutic width and are also subject to mediums of the cytochrom P450 Isoenzyme 3A4 (CYP3A4).</seg>
<seg id="1938">Herbal preparations containing St. John's wort (Hypericum perforatum) may not be used because of the risk of reduced plasma concentrations and a diminished therapeutic effect of amprenavir during the intake of amprenavir (see Section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1939">Patients should be advised that atrial or any other antiretroviral therapy does not lead to a cure of HIV infection and that they can continue to develop opportunistic infections or other complications of HIV infection.</seg>
<seg id="1940">The current antiretroviral therapy including treatment with asshrease does not prevent the risk of transmitting HIV to others through sexual contact or contamination with blood.</seg>
<seg id="1941">Usually asenase capsules should be used together with low doses of kritonavir and in combination with other antiretroviral medicines (see section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="1942">Patients who suffer from chronic hepatitis B or C and are treated with antiretroviral combination therapy have an increased risk of serious liver repercussions with potentially fatal outcome.</seg>
<seg id="1943">In case of simultaneous antiviral treatment of hepatitis B or C please consult the relevant specialist information of this medicine.</seg>
<seg id="1944">Patients with pre-existing liver function, including chronic-active hepatitis, show increased frequency of liver dysfunction under an antiretroviral combination therapy and should be monitored according to clinical practice.</seg>
<seg id="1945">The simultaneous use of Agenerase and Ritonavir with fluticasone or other glucocorticoids, which are metabolised via CYP3A4, is not recommended unless the potential benefits of treatment outweigh the risk of systemic corticosteroidal effects including Morbus Cushing and Suppression of the adrenal function (see Section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1946">Since the metabolism of the HMG CoA reductase inhibitor Loveatin and Simvastatin is highly dependent on CYP3A4, a simultaneous administration of asenase with Loveatin and Simvastatin is not recommended because of the increased risk of myopathies including rhabdomyolysis.</seg>
<seg id="1947">4 For some medicines that may cause serious or life-threatening side effects such as carbamazepine, phenobarbital, phenytoin, tricyclic antidepressants and warfarin (under supervision of the International Standard Ratio), methods are available to determine the drug concentration.</seg>
<seg id="1948">In patients who take this medicine at the same time, amprenavir can be less effective because of reduced plasma levels (see Section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1949">Due to the possibility of metabolic interactions with amprenavir, the effectiveness of hormonal contraceptives may be altered, but the information is not sufficient to assess the nature of the interactions.</seg>
<seg id="1950">If methadone is given at the same time with amprenavir, patients should therefore be monitored on Opiate withdrawal symptoms, especially if there are also low doses of kritonavir administered.</seg>
<seg id="1951">Because of the possible risk of toxicity due to the high propyl English content of the Agenerase solution, this formulation is contraindicated in children under a age of four years and should be used with care for certain other patient populations.</seg>
<seg id="1952">Asgenase should be set in duration 5 when a rash of systemic or allergic symptoms is accompanied or the mucous membranes are involved (see Section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="1953">Patients receiving antiretroviral therapy including protease inhibitors were reported on the incidence of diabetes mellitus, hyperglycemia, or an exazation of an existing diabetes mellitus.</seg>
<seg id="1954">Many of the patients had other illnesses whose therapy was required to be associated with the development of diabetes mellitus or hyperglycemia.</seg>
<seg id="1955">B. increased age, and with drug-dependent factors, such as prolonged antiretroviral treatment and associated metabolic disorders associated with it.</seg>
<seg id="1956">In hemophilic patients (type A and B) treated with protease inhibitors, reports about an increase of bleeding including spontaneous cutaneous hematoma and hemothrosis are present.</seg>
<seg id="1957">In HIV-infected patients with severe immune defect, an antiretroviral combination therapy (ART) may develop an inflammatory response to asymptomatic or residual opportunistic infections, leading to severe clinical conditions or worsening symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="1958">Although multifactorial aetiology is accepted (including use of corticosteroids, alcohol consumption, severe immunosuppression, higher body mass index), cases of osteoarthritis were reported in particular in patients with advanced HIV infection and / or long-term application of an antiretroviral combination therapy (ART).</seg>
<seg id="1959">CYP3A4 Substrate with low therapeutical width asenase must not be given at the same time with medicines which have a low therapeutic width and are also subject to mediums of the cytochrom P450 Isoenzyme 3A4 (CYP3A4).</seg>
<seg id="1960">CYP2D6 mediums with a low therapeutic width apriase with kritonavir must not be combined with medicines, whose active ingredients are predominantly metabolised using CYP2D6 and are associated with severe and / or life-threatening side effects.</seg>
<seg id="1961">It has been shown that Rifampicin causes a 82% reduction in the AUC of amprenavir, which can lead to a virological failure and a resistance development.</seg>
<seg id="1962">In trying to compensate the degraded plasma levels by a dose increase of other protease inhibitors in combination with kritonavir, adverse effects on the liver were often observed.</seg>
<seg id="1963">St. John's wort (Hypericum perforatum) The serum levels of amprenavir can be reduced by the simultaneous use of herbal preparations with St. John's wort (Hypericum perforatum).</seg>
<seg id="1964">If a patient already uses Johanniskraut, the amprenavies are and, if possible, check the viral load and remove the St. John's wort.</seg>
<seg id="1965">Dosage adjustment for one of the drugs is not required when nelfinavir is administered together with amprenavir (see also Efavirenz below).</seg>
<seg id="1966">50% increase for Cmax by 30% if Ritonavir (100 mg twice daily) was administered in combination with amprenavir capsules (600 mg twice daily).</seg>
<seg id="1967">In clinical trials, doses of 600 mg of amprenavir were used twice daily and kritonavir 100 mg twice daily, demonstrating the efficacy and safety of this treatment scheme.</seg>
<seg id="1968">52% lower when amprenavir (750 mg twice daily) was administered in combination with Kaletra (400 mg Lopinavir + 100 mg Ritonavir twice daily).</seg>
<seg id="1969">The Cmin values of amprenavir in plasma (600 mg twice daily) with Kaletra (400 mg Lopinavir + 100 mg Ritonavir twice daily) are approximately 40 to 50% lower than if amprenavir (600 mg twice daily) is administered twice daily in combination with 100 mg of Ritonavir.</seg>
<seg id="1970">Dosage recommendations for the simultaneous administration of amprenavir and Kaletra can not be given, however, it is recommended a close monitoring because the effectiveness and safety of this combination is not known.</seg>
<seg id="1971">No pharmacokinetic study was carried out for use of didanosine in combination with didanosine, but due to the fantasies of Didanosine it is recommended that the incomes of didanosine and asenase apart at least one hour apart (see Antazida below).</seg>
<seg id="1972">Therefore, in combination with amprenavir (600 mg twice daily) and kritonavir (100 mg twice daily), no dose adjustment is required in combination with amprenavir (600 mg twice daily) and kritonavir (100 mg twice daily).</seg>
<seg id="1973">The treatment with Efavirenz in combination with amprenavir and saquinavir is not recommended as exposure of both protease inhibitors would decrease.</seg>
<seg id="1974">The effects of nevirapin on other protease inhibitors and existing limited data suggest that nevirapins may reduce the serum concentration of amprenavir.</seg>
<seg id="1975">If these drugs should be used at the same time, caution is advised, because Delavirdine could be less effective because of the reduced or possibly subtherapeutic plasma levels.</seg>
<seg id="1976">If these drugs are used together, caution is advised; a thorough clinical and virological monitoring should be made as a precise prediction of the effect of the combination of amprenavir and kritonavir on Delavirdine is difficult.</seg>
<seg id="1977">The simultaneous administration of amprenavir and rifabutin led to an increase in plasma concentration (AUC) of rifabutin by 193%, resulting in a rise in side effects associated with rifabutin.</seg>
<seg id="1978">If it is necessary for clinical reasons to administer rifabutin together with asenase, a reduction in the dosage of rifabutin will be at least half of the recommended dose, although there are no clinical data available.</seg>
<seg id="1979">Pharmacokinetic studies with erythromycin combined with erythromycin were not carried out, however, the plasma levels of both drugs could be increased in the case of simultaneous administration.</seg>
<seg id="1980">The simultaneous application of twice daily 700 mg of Fosamprenavir and 100 mg of ketoconazole once daily led to an increase of Cmax of ketoconazole in plasma by 25% and the AUC (0-τ) to 2.69fold compared to the value observed once a day without simultaneous use of Fosamprenavir with Ritonavir.</seg>
<seg id="1981">Other medicines listed below, including substrates, inhibitors or CYP3A4 Inductors, may lead to interactions when they are used together with asgenerase.</seg>
<seg id="1982">Patients should therefore be monitored for toxic reactions that are associated with these drugs if they are used in combination with asgenerase.</seg>
<seg id="1983">Based on the data of other protease inhibitors it is advisable that antacids are not taken at the same time as asshrease as it can come to resorption disorders.</seg>
<seg id="1984">The simultaneous use of anticonvulants known as enzyme (phenytoin, phenobarbital, carbamazepine), with amprenavir, can lead to a degradation of the plasma levels of amprenavir.</seg>
<seg id="1985">Serum concentrations of calcium channel blockers such as amlodipin, diltiazem, ripendipin, nimodipine, nifedipin, nimodipine, nifedipin and verapamil can be increased by 10 through amprenavir, thereby increasing the activity and toxicity of these drugs.</seg>
<seg id="1986">The simultaneous intake of asenase can significantly increase the plasma concentrations and strengthen associated side effects associated with PDE5 inhibitors including hypotension, visual disturbances and priapism (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1987">In a clinical study, where kritonavir was given 100 mg capsules twice a day together with 50 µg fluticasonpropionate intranasal (4 times a day), the Fluticasonpropionate plasma levels increased significantly, while the endogenous cortisol decreased by about 86% (90% confidence interval 82 to 89%).</seg>
<seg id="1988">As a result, the simultaneous gift of asenase with kritonavir is not recommended along with these glucocorticoids, unless the potential benefits of treatment outweigh the risk of systemic corticosteroidal effects (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1989">In the case of HMG CoA reductase inhibitors such as Loveatin and Simvastatin, whose interpolation is strongly dependent on CYP3A4, pronounced increases in plasma levels are expected while administering asenase.</seg>
<seg id="1990">Since plasma level increases of these HMG CoA reductase inhibitors can lead to myopathy, including a rhubdomyolysis, the combined use of these drugs with amprenavir is not recommended.</seg>
<seg id="1991">More frequent monitoring of therapeutic concentrations to stabilization of the levels is recommended, since the plasma concentrations of cyclosporine, rapamycin and tacrolimus can be increased with simultaneous administration of amprenavir (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1992">Therefore, asgenerase may not be used together with Midazolam taken orally (see Section 4.3), while with simultaneous use of asenase with parenteral midazolam caution is required.</seg>
<seg id="1993">Data for simultaneous use of parenteral midazolam with other protease inhibitors indicate a possible increase in the plasma levels of midazolam around 3 to 4 times.</seg>
<seg id="1994">If methadone is administered together with amprenavir, patients should therefore be monitored on Opiate withdrawal symptoms, especially if there are also low doses of kritonavir administered.</seg>
<seg id="1995">Because of the low reliability of historical comparisons, no recommendation can be given at the moment, such as the amprenavir dosage, if amprenavir is administered at the same time with methadone.</seg>
<seg id="1996">With simultaneous dispensation of warfarin or other oral anticoagulants together with asgenase an increased control of INR (International Standard Ratio) is recommended because of the possibility of weakening or strengthening the antithrombotic effect (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1997">The effect of an additional administration of Ritonavir on hormonal contraceptives is not predictable, so alternative methods for contraception are also recommended.</seg>
<seg id="1998">Careful monitoring of the therapeutic effects and side effects of tricyclic antidepressants (for example Desipramine and Nortryptilin) is recommended with simultaneous dispensation of asenase (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1999">During pregnancy, this drug may only be used after careful weighing of the potential benefits for the mother in comparison to the possible risks for the fetus.</seg>
<seg id="2000">In the milk of lactation rats, amprenavir-related substances have been detected, but it is not known whether or not amprenavir is transferred to breast milk in humans.</seg>
<seg id="2001">A reproduction study of pregnant rats, given to amprenavir in the uterus until the end of the lactation period, showed a diminished increase of the 12 body weight during breastfeeding.</seg>
<seg id="2002">Further development of the seed, including fertility and reproductive capacity, was not affected by the administration of amprenavir to the mother animal.</seg>
<seg id="2003">The harmlessness of asgenase has been studied in adults and in children over 4 years in controlled clinical trials in combination with various other antiretroviral medicines.</seg>
<seg id="2004">Most of the side effects associated with Agenerase treatment were mild to moderate, early on and rarely lead to treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2005">Many of these events are not clarified whether they are related to the intake of drugs or any other medicine used at the same time, or whether they are a consequence of the underlying disease.</seg>
<seg id="2006">Most of the side effects listed below date from two clinical trials (PROAB3001, PROAB3006), in which patients receiving protease inhibitors received 1200 mg of asgenerase twice daily.</seg>
<seg id="2007">Events (grade 2 to 4), which were evaluated by the investigators as in connection with the study medication and performed in more than 1% of the patients, as well as laboratory changes occurring in the treatment (grade 3 to 4) are listed.</seg>
<seg id="2008">Antiretroviral combination therapy was associated with a redistribution of body fat (Lipodystrophy) in HIV patients, including loss of peripheral and peripheral fatty tissue, increased intraabdominal and visceral adipose tissue, hypertrophie of breasts and dorsocervical fat accumulation (Stiernes).</seg>
<seg id="2009">Under 113 antiretroviral infections not treated with amprenavir in combination with lamivudine / zidovudine for a mean duration of 36 weeks, only one case (Stiernack) (&lt; 1%) was observed.</seg>
<seg id="2010">In the study PROJIA 3006 patients with 245 NRTI- treated patients under Amprenavir 7 cases (3%) compared to 27 cases (11%) in 241 patients under indinavir, in combination with different NRTIs over a mean duration of 56 weeks (p &lt; 0.001).</seg>
<seg id="2011">Rashes were usually mild to moderate, erythematous or macabloidous nature, with or without itching and occurred spontaneously during the second week of treatment and disappeared spontaneously within two weeks without the treatment having to be stopped with amprenavir.</seg>
<seg id="2012">Cases of osteoarthritis were reported in particular in patients with generally known risk factors, advanced HIV disease or long-term application of an antiretroviral combination therapy (ART).</seg>
<seg id="2013">In HIV-infected patients with severe immune defect, an antiretroviral combination therapy (ART) may develop an inflammatory response to asymptomatic or residual opportunistic infections (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2014">With PI pre-treated patients receiving 600 mg asgenera twice daily along with low dose rikritavir (100 mg twice daily), the type and frequency of adverse events (grade 2 to 4) and laboratory changes (Grade 3 and 4) were comparable to those who received alase with low dosed kritonavir, very often occurred.</seg>
<seg id="2015">In case of overdose, the patient should observe signs of an intoxication (see Section 4.8) if necessary, to initiate necessary supporting measures.</seg>
<seg id="2016">Amprenavir binds to the active centre of the HIV-1 protease and thereby prevents the process of viral Gag- and gag-pol- polyproteinformation with the result of a formation of unripe, non infectious viral particles.</seg>
<seg id="2017">The antiviral activity of amprenavir in vitro against HIV-1 IIIB was studied both in acute and chronically infected lymphoblast cell lines (MT-4, CEM-CCRF, H9) as well as peripheral blood lymphocytes.</seg>
<seg id="2018">The 50% inhibit concentration (IC50) of amprenavir is in the range of 0,012 to 0.08 µM in infected cells and is 0.41 µM in chronically infected cells</seg>
<seg id="2019">The connection between the activity of amprenavir against HIV-1 in vitro and inhibition of HIV-1 replication in humans is not yet defined.</seg>
<seg id="2020">In the treatment of antiretroviral non-pretreated patients with the currently approved Fosamprenavir / Ritonavir-dosages, as with other Ritonavir-based treatment regimens with protease inhibitors, the described mutations were rarely observed.</seg>
<seg id="2021">At sixteen of 434 antiretroviral non-virally untreated patients who received 700mg of Fosamprenavir with 100mg of Ritonavir twice a day in the ESS100732 trial, a virological failure occurred up to week 48, whereby 14 Isolate could be genotypically examined.</seg>
<seg id="2022">Genotypic analysis of the isolation of 13 out of 14 children, in which a virological failure occurred within 59 patients with protease inhibitors, showed resistance patterns similar to those in adults.</seg>
<seg id="2023">L10F / I / V, V11I, I13V, K20R, V32I, L33F, E34Q, I54L, D60E, I62V, D60E, V77I, V82A / I, I62A / I, I84V, I85V, L90M and I93L / M.</seg>
<seg id="2024">In the APV30003 and its extension of APV30005 (700 mg of Fosamprenavir / 100 mg Ritonavir twice daily: n = 107), patients treated with protease inhibitors performed over 96 weeks following protease inhibitor mutations:</seg>
<seg id="2025">Genotypic resistance tests based on genotypic resistance tests can be used to estimate the activity of amprenavir / Ritonavir or Fosamprenavir / Ritonavir in patients with protease inhibitor-resistant isolates.</seg>
<seg id="2026">The current (July 2006) ANRS-AC-11 algorithm for Fosamprenavir / Ritonavir defines resistance as the presence of mutations V32I + 147a / V, or I50V, or at least 4 of the following mutations L10F / I, I62V, V82A / C / S / T / V, I84V and L90M in conjunction with an increased phenotypic resistance to Ritonavir and a reduced probability of a virological response (resistance).</seg>
<seg id="2027">The conclusions regarding the relevance of certain mutations or mutation patterns may be subject to alterations by additional data, and it is recommended to always draw up the current interpretation systems for analyzing the results of resistance tests.</seg>
<seg id="2028">Phenotypic analysis systems based on phenotypic resistance tests can be used in combination with genotypic data to estimate the activity of amprenavir / Ritonavir or Fosamprenavir / Ritonavir in patients with protease inhibitor-resistant isolates.</seg>
<seg id="2029">Companies that drive diagnostic resistance tests have developed clinically-phenotypic cut-offs for FPV / RTV which can be used to interpret the results of resistance tests.</seg>
<seg id="2030">Each of these four genetic samples with reduced sensitivity to amprenavir creates a certain amount of cross resistance to Ritonavir, but the sensitivity to indinavir, nelfinavir and saquinavir remains generally preserved.</seg>
<seg id="2031">There are currently data to cross resistance between amprenavir and other protease inhibitors for all 4 Fosamprenavir resistance paths, either alone or in combination with other mutations.</seg>
<seg id="2032">On the basis of twenty-five antiretroviral non-virally treated patients, in which a fossil-viola-containing scheme failed (one of which proved resistance to Lopinavir and saquinavir at the beginning of treatment), indinavir / Ritonavir (one of 25 isolates), saquinavir (three of 24 isolates) and Tidenavir / Ritonavir (four out of 24 isolates).</seg>
<seg id="2033">On the other hand, amprenavir maintains its activity against some other protease inhibitor-resistant isolates; the preservation of this activity appears to be dependent on the number and type of resistance mutations in the isolates.</seg>
<seg id="2034">The early departure of a failing therapy is recommended in order to keep the accumulation of a variety of mutations within limits, which can adversely affect subsequent treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2035">The evidence of the efficacy of asgenerase in combination with kritonavir 100 mg twice daily is based on the study PRO30017, a randomized open study conducted with PI pretreated adults according to virological failure (100 mg twice daily) and Nucleosidanuga (NRTI) or standard therapy (standard of care, SOC) with a PI, predominantly with low-dosed kritonavir.</seg>
<seg id="2036">One hundred and sixty-three (n = 163) patients with proven virus sensitivity to asenase, at least another PI and at least one NRTI were included in the partial study A of PRO30017.</seg>
<seg id="2037">The primary analysis showed the non-inferiority of APV / Ritonavir compared to the SOC PI group in the viral load (HIV-1 RNA) in the viral load (HIV-1 RNA) in the plasma after 16 weeks, with a non-subcutaneous threshold of 0.4 log10 copies / ml.</seg>
<seg id="2038">The evidence of the efficacy of unbridled asterase is based on two uncontrolled trials with a total of 288 HIV-infected children aged 2 to 18, of which 152 were treated with PI.</seg>
<seg id="2039">In the studies, asenase solution for intake and capsules was examined three times a day, 20 mg / kg three times a day, 20 mg / kg twice daily and 22.5 mg / kg twice a day, whereby the majority of patients received 20 mg / kg twice daily.</seg>
<seg id="2040">There was no low dose of Ritonavir at the same time; the majority of patients treated with PI had previously received at least one (78%) or two (42%) of the NRTIs administered together with Agenerase.</seg>
<seg id="2041">After 48 weeks approximately 25% of patients enrolled in the study had a plasma-HIV-1 RNA concentration &lt; 10,000 copies / ml and 9% &lt; 400 copies / ml for a median increase of the CD4 cell count of 26 cells / mm ³ (n = 74) compared to the initial value.</seg>
<seg id="2042">19 Based on this data, the anticipated benefits of "unbleoostertem" amenase should be considered in therapy optimisation with PI pre-treated children.</seg>
<seg id="2043">After oral administration, the mean duration (Tmax) to the maximum serum concentration of amprenavir is approximately 1 to 2 hours for the capsule and about 0.5 to 1 hour for the solution.</seg>
<seg id="2044">50% increase for Cmax by 30% if Ritonavir (100 mg twice daily) was administered together with amprenavir (600 mg twice daily).</seg>
<seg id="2045">The administration of amprenavir with a meal leads to a 25% decrease in AUC but has no effect on the concentration of amprenavir 12 hours after dosage (C12).</seg>
<seg id="2046">For this reason, the minimum concentration in the Steady State (Cmin, ss) remained uninfluenced by food intake, although the simultaneous food intake was influenced by the extent and rate of absorption.</seg>
<seg id="2047">The apparent distribution volume amounts to approximately 430 l (6 l / kg for a body weight of 70 kg) and can be closed to a large distribution volume as well as an unhindered penetration of amprenavir from the bloodstream into the tissue.</seg>
<seg id="2048">This change leads to a decrease in the total concentration of the active substance in the plasma, whereby the amount of unbound amprenavir, which represents the active part, probably remains unchanged.</seg>
<seg id="2049">While the absolute concentration of unbound amprenavir remains constant, the percentage of free active components fluctuates during the dosing interval, depending on the total drug concentration in the Steady State through the range of Cmax, ss to Cmin, ss.</seg>
<seg id="2050">Therefore, drugs that induce or inhibit CYP3A4 or represent a substrate of CYP3A4 may be administered cautiously if given at the same time as asgenerase (see Section15.4.3, 4.4 and 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2051">The gift of asenase capsules, either 20 mg / kg twice or 15 mg / kg three times a day, leads to a similar daily amprenavir exposure as in adults with a dose of 1200 mg twice daily.</seg>
<seg id="2052">Amprenavir is 14% less bioavailable than from capsules. therefore, asenase solution and asenase capsules are not interchangeable on a milligram basis.</seg>
<seg id="2053">Also, the renal clearance of Ritonavir is negligible, therefore the effect of a kidney function disorder should be low on the elimination of amprenavir and kritonavir.</seg>
<seg id="2054">These treatment schemes lead to amprenavir plasma levels comparable to those obtained from healthy volunteers following a dose of 1200 mg of amprenavir twice a day without the simultaneous administration of Ritonavir.</seg>
<seg id="2055">In long-term studies for carcinogenicity of mice and rats occured in male animals hepatocellular adenomas in dosages, which corresponded to the 2.0-fold (mice) or 3.8-fold (rat) of exposure to humans, after twice daily dosage of 1200 mg of amprenavir.</seg>
<seg id="2056">The 21 underlying mechanism for the emergence of hepatocellular adenomas and carcinomas was not yet clarified and the relevance of these observed effects for humans is unclear.</seg>
<seg id="2057">However, there were little indications of the clinical relevance of these findings from the existing exposure data on humans, both from clinical studies and therapeutic applications.</seg>
<seg id="2058">In a standard battery of in-vitro and in-vitro genotoxicity tests, the bacterial reverse mutation tests (Ames test), mouse lymphoma test, microkernel test of rats and chromosomal aberrations tests on human peripheral lymphocytes contained, amprenavir was neither mutagen nor genotoxic.</seg>
<seg id="2059">This liver toxicity can be monitored and proven in the clinical routine by measuring AST, ALT and the activity of alkaline phosphatase.</seg>
<seg id="2060">So far, no significant liver toxicity in patients has been observed in clinical studies, neither during administering asenoid nor after treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2061">Studies of toxicity in juveniles, which were treated at an age of 4 days, showed a high mortality in both the control animals and the animals treated with amprenavir.</seg>
<seg id="2062">In a systemic plasma exposition, which was significantly lower (rabbits) or not significantly higher (rats) than expected exposure to humans, however, a number of minor changes including thymus and minor skeletal changes were observed indicating a delayed development.</seg>
<seg id="2063">24 If asenoid capsules are used without the increased added of kritonavir (boosting), higher doses of asenase (1200 mg twice daily) must be applied.</seg>
<seg id="2064">The recommended dose for asenase capsules is 20 mg of amprenavir / kg body weight twice daily in combination with other antiretroviral medicines up to a daily dose of 2400 mg of amprenavir which should not be exceeded (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2065">The simultaneous application should be conducted with caution in patients with low or light liver dysfunction, in patients with severe liver dysfunctions, they are contraindicated (see Section 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="2066">26 For some medicines that may cause serious or life-threatening side effects such as carbamazepine, phenobarbital, phenytoin, tricyclic antidepressants and warfarin (under supervision of the International Standard Ratio), methods are available to determine the drug concentration.</seg>
<seg id="2067">Asgenase should be set to 27 if a rash of systemic or allergic symptoms is accompanied or the mucous membranes are involved (see Section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="2068">An increased risk of lipodystrophy was associated with individual factors, such as higher age, and drug-related factors, such as prolonged antiretroviral treatment and associated metabolic disorders.</seg>
<seg id="2069">It has been shown that Rifampicin causes a 82% reduction in the AUC of amprenavir, which can lead to a virological failure and a resistance development.</seg>
<seg id="2070">50% increase for Cmax by 30% if Ritonavir (100 mg twice daily) was administered in combination with amprenavir capsules (600 mg twice daily).</seg>
<seg id="2071">The Cmin values of amprenavir in plasma (600 mg twice daily) with Kaletra (400 mg Lopinavir + 100 mg Ritonavir twice daily) are approximately 40 to 50% lower than if amprenavir (600 mg twice daily) is administered twice daily in combination with 100 mg of Ritonavir.</seg>
<seg id="2072">Dosage recommendations for the simultaneous administration of amprenavir and Kaletra can not be given, however, it is recommended a close monitoring because the effectiveness and safety of this combination is not known.</seg>
<seg id="2073">The treatment with Efavirenz in combination with amprenavir and saquinavir is not recommended as exposure of both protease inhibitors would decrease.</seg>
<seg id="2074">If these drugs are used together, caution is advised; a thorough clinical and virological monitoring should be made as a precise prediction of the effect of the combination of amprenavir and kritonavir on Delavirdine is difficult.</seg>
<seg id="2075">If it is necessary for clinical reasons to administer rifabutin together with asenase, a reduction in the dosage of rifabutin will be at least half of the recommended dose 31, although there are no clinical data available.</seg>
<seg id="2076">Serum concentrations of calcium channel blockers such as amlodipin, diltiazem, ripendipin, niopin, nifedipin, nimodipine, nifedipin, nipamil can be increased by amprenavir, which may increase the activity and toxicity of this drug.</seg>
<seg id="2077">In a clinical study, where kritonavir was given 100 mg capsules twice a day together with 50 µg fluticasonpropionate intranasal (4 times a day), the Fluticasonpropionate plasma levels increased significantly, while the endogenous cortisol decreased by about 86% (90% confidence interval 82 to 89%).</seg>
<seg id="2078">With simultaneous dispensation of warfarin or other oral anticoagulants together with asgenase an increased control of INR (International Standard Ratio) is recommended because of the possibility of weakening or strengthening the antithrombotic effect (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2079">The simultaneous administration of ortho-novum 1 / 35 (0.035 mg of ethinyl estradiol plus 1.0 mg Norethindron) led to a decrease in AUC and Cmin of amprenavir by 22% respectively.</seg>
<seg id="2080">During pregnancy, this drug may only be used after careful weighing of the possible benefits for the mother in comparison with possible risks for the fetus.</seg>
<seg id="2081">A reproduction study of pregnant rats, given to amprenavir in the uterus until the end of the lactation period, showed a diminished increase in body weight during breastfeeding.</seg>
<seg id="2082">The harmlessness of asgenase has been studied in adults and in children over 4 years in controlled clinical trials in combination with various other antiretroviral medicines.</seg>
<seg id="2083">In case of overdose, the patient should observe signs of an intoxication (see Section 4.8) if necessary, to initiate necessary supporting measures.</seg>
<seg id="2084">The antiviral activity of amprenavir in vitro against HIV-1 IIIB was studied both in acute and chronically infected lymphoblast cell lines (MT-4, CEM-CCRF, H9) and peripheral blood lymphocytes.</seg>
<seg id="2085">The 50% inhibit concentration (IC50) of amprenavir is in the range of 0,012 to 0.08 µM in infected cells and is 0.41 µM for chronically infected cells (1 µM = 0.50 µg / ml).</seg>
<seg id="2086">On the other hand, amprenavir maintains its activity against some other protease inhibitor-resistant isolates; the preservation of this activity appears to be dependent on the number and type of resistance mutations in the isolates.</seg>
<seg id="2087">Based on this data, the expected benefits of "unbleoostertem" amenase should be taken into account in the treatment optimisation with PI pre-treated children.</seg>
<seg id="2088">While the absolute concentration of unbound amprenavir remains constant, the percentage of free active components fluctuates during the dosing interval, depending on the total drug concentration in the Steady State through the range of Cmax, ss to Cmin, ss..</seg>
<seg id="2089">Therefore, drugs that induce or inhibit CYP3A4 or represent a substrate of CYP3A4 may be administered cautiously if given at the same time as asgenerase (see Section15.4.3, 4.4 and 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2090">Also the renal clearance of Ritonavir is negligible; therefore the effect of a renal dysfunction is likely to be low on the elimination of amprenavir and kritonavir.</seg>
<seg id="2091">In long-term studies for carcinogenicity of mice and rats occured in male animals hepatocellular adenomas in dosages, which corresponded to the 2.0-fold (mice) or 3.8-fold (rat) of exposure to humans after twice daily dosage of 1200 mg of amprenavir.</seg>
<seg id="2092">The underlying mechanism for the emergence of hepatocellular adenomas and carcinomas was not yet clarified and the relevance of these observed effects for humans is unclear.</seg>
<seg id="2093">However, there was little evidence of the clinical relevance of these findings from the existing exposure data on humans, both from clinical studies and therapeutic applications.</seg>

<seg id="2097">Aspartase solution for intake is indicated in combination with other antiretroviral medicines to treat HIV-1-infected, protease inhibitors (PI) -treated adults and children over 4 years.</seg>
<seg id="2098">The benefits of using kritonavir "geboosterter" asgenerase solution for intake was not occupied with patients treated with PI nor with PI pre-treated patients.</seg>
<seg id="2099">The bioavailability of amprenavir as a solution to intake is 14% lower than amprenavir as capsule; therefore, asenase capsules and solution for intake on one milligram per milligram base are not interchangeable (see Section 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="2100">Patients should be able to swallow the capsules once they are able to stop taking the solution (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2101">The recommended dose for Agaase solution is 17 mg (1.1 ml) of amprenavir / kg body weight three times a day in combination with other antiretroviral medicines up to a daily dose of 2800 mg of amprenavir which should not be exceeded (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2102">In addition, as there is no dose recommendation for the simultaneous use of asgenerase solution for inhaling and low dosed kritonavir, this combination may be avoided in these patient populations.</seg>
<seg id="2103">Although dosage adjustment for amprenavir is not considered necessary, an application of asenase solution is contraindicated in patients with kidney failure (see Section 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="2104">Due to the potential risk of toxic reaction as a result of high propylglycol content, Agenerase is contraindicated for the use in infants and children under 4 years, in pregnant women, in patients with reduced liver function or liver failure and in patients with kidney failure.</seg>
<seg id="2105">Simultaneous administration may lead to a competitive inhibition of this drug metabolism and may cause serious and / or life-threatening side effects such as heart rhythm disorders (z).</seg>
<seg id="2106">Patients should be advised that atrial or any other antiretroviral therapy does not lead to a cure of HIV infection and that they will continue to develop opportunistic infections or other complications of HIV infection.</seg>
<seg id="2107">The current antiretroviral therapy including treatment with asshrease does not prevent the risk of 47 transmission of HIV to others through sexual contact or contamination with blood.</seg>
<seg id="2108">For some medicines that may cause serious or life-threatening side effects, such as carbamazepine, phenobarbital, phenytoin, tricyclic antidepressants and warfarin (under supervision of the International Standard Ratio), methods are available to determine the drug concentration.</seg>
<seg id="2109">Aspartase should be stopped for a long time if a rash of systemic or allergic symptoms is accompanied or the mucous membranes are involved (see Section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="2110">An increased risk of lipodystrophy was associated with individual factors, such as higher age, and with drug-49 dependent factors, such as prolonged antiretroviral treatment and associated metabolic disorders.</seg>
<seg id="2111">In hemophilic patients (type A and B) treated with protease inhibitors, reports about an increase of bleeding including spontaneous cutaneous hematoma and hemothrosis are present.</seg>
<seg id="2112">It has been shown that Rifampicin causes a 82% reduction in the AUC of amprenavir, which can lead to a virological failure and a resistance development.</seg>
<seg id="2113">50% increase for Cmax by 30% if Ritonavir (100 mg twice daily) was administered in combination with amprenavir capsules (600 mg twice daily).</seg>
<seg id="2114">The simultaneous intake of asenase can considerably increase the plasma concentrations and result in associated adverse events associated with PDE5 inhibitors including hypotension, visual disturbances and priapism (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2115">Based on data on 54 other CYP3A4 inhibitors, Midazolam significantly increases plasma concentrations of Midazolam following oral administration of Midazolam.</seg>
<seg id="2116">The potential risk for humans is not known. Agenerase solution for intake may not be applied during pregnancy due to possible toxic reactions of the fetus (see section 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="2117">In the milk of lactation rats, amprenavir-related substances have been detected, but it is not known whether or not amprenavir is transferred to breast milk in humans.</seg>
<seg id="2118">A reproduction study of pregnant rats, given to amprenavir in the uterus until the end of the lactation period, showed a reduced increase in the 55 body weight during breastfeeding.</seg>

<seg id="2120">Many of these events are not clarified whether they are related to the intake of drugs or any other medicine used at the same time, or whether they are a consequence of the underlying disease.</seg>
<seg id="2121">In the treatment of antiretroviral non-pretreated patients with the currently approved Fosamprenavir / Ritonavir-dosages, as with other Ritonavir-based treatment regimens with protease inhibitors, the described mutations were rarely observed.</seg>
<seg id="2122">Early departure of a failing 60 therapy is recommended in order to keep the accumulation of a variety of mutations within limits, which can adversely affect subsequent treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2123">62 Basically on this data, the anticipated benefits of "unbleoostertem" amenase should be taken into account in the treatment optimisation with PI pre-treated children.</seg>
<seg id="2124">The apparent distribution volume amounts to approximately 430 l (6 l / kg for a body weight of 70 kg) and can be closed to a large veal volume as well as an unhindered penetration of amprenavir from the bloodstream into the tissue.</seg>

<seg id="2174">The frequency of application and the duration of treatment with Aldara depend on the condition to be treated: • In case of small basal cell carcinomas, the cream can be applied three times a week for a maximum of 16 weeks. • In case of small basal cell carcinomas, it is available three times a week during one or two weeks of treatment, with a pause of four weeks between the treatment cycles.</seg>
<seg id="2175">Before bedtime, apply thin layer of cream to the affected areas of the skin, so that it remains sufficiently long (about eight hours) on the skin before it is washed off.</seg>
<seg id="2176">In all studies, Aldara was compared with a placebo (the same cream, but without the active ingredient). • Aldara was tested in four main studies of 923 patients with warts in the genital area for 16 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="2177">The main indicator of efficacy was the number of patients with complete healing of treated warts. • Aldara was also studied in 724 patients with small basal cell carcinomas in two studies where patients were treated for six weeks and Aldara or placebo administered either daily or five times a week.</seg>
<seg id="2178">The main indicator of efficacy was the number of patients with complete healing of tumors after 12 weeks. • Aldara was also tested in two studies in total of 505 patients with actinic keratoses.</seg>
<seg id="2179">In all studies, Aldara was more effective than the placebo. • In the treatment of warts in the genital area, the complete recovery rate in all four main studies was 15% to 52% in patients treated with placebo. • The results of both studies on basal cell carcinomas showed a complete recovery rate of 66% to 80% in patients treated with Aldara compared to 0% to 3% in the placebo group.</seg>

<seg id="2191">When using imiquimod cream in higher than recommended doses, there is an increased risk of severe local skin irritation (see section 4.2.) In rare cases, severe local skin irritation was observed in rare cases, which necessitated a treatment and / or caused temporary physical impairment.</seg>
<seg id="2192">In cases where such reactions occurred at the exit of the urethra, some women had difficulty passing urine that necessitated an emergency catheterisation and treatment of the affected area.</seg>

<seg id="2198">The clinical outcome of the therapy can be assessed after the regeneration of the treated skin about 12 weeks after the end of treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2199">Since there are currently no data on long-term healing rates of more than 36 months after treatment, other suitable therapy forms should be considered in the case of superficially basal cell carcinomas.</seg>
<seg id="2200">In patients with recurrent and pre-treated BCCs no clinical experience is present, therefore the application is not recommended in case of pre-treated tumors.</seg>
<seg id="2201">Data from an open clinical trial suggest that there is a lower probability of response to imiquimodine therapy in large tumors (&gt; 7.25 cm2).</seg>
<seg id="2202">Imiquimodine was not examined for the treatment of actinic keratoses on eyelids, inside the nose or ears or on the lip area within the lips.</seg>
<seg id="2203">There are only very limited data about the use of imiquimodine for the treatment of actinic keratoses in anatomical areas outside the face and scalp.</seg>
<seg id="2204">The available data on actinic keratose on forearms and hands does not support the effectiveness of this use, therefore such an application is not recommended.</seg>
<seg id="2205">Local skin reactions often occur, but these reactions usually decrease in intensity during therapy or go back after the treatment with imiquimod cream.</seg>
<seg id="2206">If the local skin reactions cause a lot of discomfort to the patient or are very strong, treatment may be suspended for a few days.</seg>
<seg id="2207">From the data of an open clinical study, patients with more than 8 lesions showed a lower total cure rate than patients with less than 8 lesions.</seg>
<seg id="2208">Due to the immuno-stimulating properties, Imiquimod cream should be used with care in patients receiving immunosuppressive treatment (see 4.4).</seg>

<seg id="2213">The side effects reported by 185 with Imiquimod cream from a placebo-controlled clinical study of phase III reported side effects are shown below.</seg>
<seg id="2214">The most common, probably or possibly associated with the application of imiquimod cream in the context, were in these studies a response to the application location (22% of patients treated with imiquimodine).</seg>
<seg id="2215">The side effects reported by 252 in placebo-controlled clinical studies of phase III with Imiquimod cream treated patients with actinic keratose are listed below.</seg>
<seg id="2216">According to the study plan, the evaluation of the clinical signs indicated that in these placebo-controlled clinical studies with three times weekly treatment with Imiquimod cream frequently occurred local skin reactions including erythem (61%), excreoriation / abortion / shed (23%) and edema (14%) (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2217">According to the study plan, the evaluation of the clinical signs revealed that in these studies five times weekly treatment with imiquimodine cream very often resulted in severe erythema (31%), severe erosions (13%), and heavy flocculation and incineration (19%).</seg>
<seg id="2218">In clinical studies for the treatment of imiquimodine for the treatment of actinic keratose, alopecia was detected with a frequency of 0.4% (5 / 1214) at the treatment centre or in the surrounding area.</seg>
<seg id="2219">The inadvertent one-time oral recording of 200 mg of imiquimod, which corresponds to the content of about 16 bags, might cause nausea, vomiting, headache, myalgia and fever.</seg>
<seg id="2220">The clinically serious side effect that occurred after several oral doses of &gt; 200 mg consisted in hypotony, which normalized after oral or intravenous injections.</seg>
<seg id="2221">In a pharmacokinetic study, systemic concentrations of alpha interferons and other cytokines were detected after the topical application of imiquimodine.</seg>
<seg id="2222">In 3 pivotal phase 3 efficacy studies, efficacy in the treatment of an imiquimodine treatment over 16 weeks of placebo treatment was clearly superior.</seg>
<seg id="2223">At 60% of the total of 119 patients with Imiquimod treated patients were completely healed; this was the case at 20% of the 105 with placebo-treated patients (95% CI):</seg>
<seg id="2224">A complete healing could be achieved in 23% of 157 patients treated with imiquimodine compared to 5% of 161 male patients treated with placebo (95% CI):</seg>
<seg id="2225">Efficacy of imiquimodine in five-colour application per week over 6 weeks was studied in two double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical studies.</seg>
<seg id="2226">The target tumors were histologically confirmed single primary superficial basal cell carcinomas with a minimum size of 0.5 cm2 and a maximum diameter of 2 cm.</seg>
<seg id="2227">Data from an open, uncontrolled long-term study after four years showed that approximately 79.3% [95% CI (73.7%, 84.9%) of all patients treated were clinically cured and this remained for 48 months.</seg>
<seg id="2228">The efficacy of imiquimodine in three weeks of treatment in one or two treatment periods of 4 weeks, interrupted by a four-week treatment period, was examined in two double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical studies.</seg>
<seg id="2229">Patients had clinically typical, visible, discrete, non-hypertrophic lesions within a related 25 cm2 of large treatment area on the hairy scalp or face.</seg>
<seg id="2230">The annual data from two combined observation studies indicate a recurrence rate of 27% (35 / 128 patients) for patients with clinical healing after one or two treatment periods.</seg>
<seg id="2231">The approved indications for external clinations, actinic keratose and Superstiel basal cell carcinoma usually do not appear in paediatric patients and were therefore not examined.</seg>
<seg id="2232">Aldara Creme was studied in four randomised, double-blind placebo-controlled trials on children aged 2 to 15 with Molluscum contagiosum (Imiquimod n = 576, placebo n = 313).</seg>
<seg id="2233">The efficacy of imiquimodine could not be shown in these studies in the dosages investigated there (3x / week for a period of ≤ 16 weeks, respectively.</seg>
<seg id="2234">A minimum systemic acceptance of the 5% imiquimodine cream through the skin of 58 patients with actinic keratose was observed during the three-week application during 16 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="2235">The highest drug concentrations in serum at the end of week 16 were observed between 9 and 12 hours and amounted to 0.1, 0.2 and 1.6 ng / ml in the face (12.5 mg, 1 disposable pouch), on the scalp (25 mg, 2 bags) and on the hands / arms (75 mg, 6 bags).</seg>
<seg id="2236">The calculated half-life period was about 10 times higher than the 2-hour half-hour after subcutaneous use in an earlier study; this points to an extended retention of the medicine in the skin.</seg>
<seg id="2237">Systemic exposure data showed that the absorption of imiquimodine after topical application on MC-diseased skin was low and comparable to that of healthy adults and adults with actinic keratose or supercharged basal cell carcinoma.</seg>
<seg id="2238">In a four-month study of dermal toxicity in rats, doses of 0.5 and 2.5 mg / kg CG resulted in significantly reduced body weight and increased spleen weight; a study carried out for four months for the dermal application yielded no similar effects in the mouse.</seg>
<seg id="2239">A two-year study of carcinogenicity in mice on three days a week did not induce tumours on the application.</seg>
<seg id="2240">The appropriate mechanism is not known, but since Imiquimodine only possesses a low system absorption from the human skin and is not mutagenic, a risk for humans is considered to be very low due to systemic exposure.</seg>
<seg id="2241">The tumors were in the group of mice treated with the active ingredient, earlier and in greater numbers than in the control group with low UVR.</seg>
<seg id="2242">It can harm other people even if they have the same symptoms as you. − If any of the listed adverse events you have significantly impaired or you notice side effects that are not stated in this information, please inform your doctor or pharmacist.</seg>

<seg id="2256">Breastfeed your baby during treatment with Aldara Cream, as it is not known whether Imiquimodine is breast-fed into breast milk.</seg>
<seg id="2257">The frequency and duration of treatment are different in case of tilting, basal cell carcinoma and actin keratose (see specific instructions for each application).</seg>
<seg id="2258">Apply a thin layer of Aldara cream to the clean, dry skin place with the skin warts and rub the cream carefully on the skin until the cream is fully absorbed.</seg>
<seg id="2259">Men with genital warts under the foreskin have to withdraw the foreskin every day and wash the skin area underneath (see section 2 "What do you have to consider before applying Aldara cream?").</seg>
<seg id="2260">Please talk to your doctor or pharmacist if you have the impression that the effect of Aldara is too strong or too weak.</seg>

<seg id="2266">Tell your doctor or pharmacist if any of the listed adverse events affect you significantly or you notice side effects that are not indicated in this information information.</seg>
<seg id="2267">In addition, you can feel itching (32% of patients), burning (26% of patients) or pain in the areas on which you have applied Aldara cream (8% of patients).</seg>
<seg id="2268">Most of the time, these are lighter skin reactions that resound within 2 weeks after the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2269">Occasionally some patients notice changes in the application place (wound secretion, inflammation, swelling, scents, skin irritation, blisters, dermatitis) or irritability, nausea, dry mouth, flu-like symptoms and tiredness.</seg>
<seg id="2270">Occasionally, some patients suffer from changes in the application place (bleeding, inflammation, wound secretion, sensitivity, swelling, smelling and scarring), inflammation of the nasal mucosa, blocked nose, flu or flu-like symptoms, depression, eye irritation, actinic keratose, redness, facial swelling, ulcers, body aches, fever, weakness or chills.</seg>
<seg id="2271">Aldurazyme is used for enzymatic therapy in patients with confirmed diagnosis of a Mucopolysaccharidosis I (MPS I; α -L-Iduronidase deficiency) to treat the non-neurological manifestations of the disease (the symptoms that are not related to brain or nerves).</seg>
<seg id="2272">This means that certain substances (glycosaminoglycans, gags) are not mined and therefore accumulate in most organs in the body and damage them.</seg>
<seg id="2273">The following non neurological symptoms of the MPS I can occur: enlarged liver, stiff joints, complicating movements, reduced lung volume, heart and eye diseases.</seg>
<seg id="2274">The treatment with Aldurazyme should be monitored by a doctor who has experience in the treatment of patients with MPS I or other inherited metabolic diseases.</seg>
<seg id="2275">The administration of Aldurazyme should take place in a hospital or clinic with revitalizing devices, and patients may need appropriate medicines prior to administration to prevent allergic reaction.</seg>

<seg id="2277">The study mainly investigates the safety of the drug, but its effectiveness has also been measured (by examining its effect on reducing GAG concentrations in the urine and in relation to the size of the liver).</seg>
<seg id="2278">In children under the age of five, Aldurazyme lowered GAG concentrations in the urine by about 60%, and half of the treated children showed a normal large liver at the end of the study.</seg>
<seg id="2279">The most common side effects of Aldurazyme in patients at the age of over five years (observed in more than 1 of 10 patients) include headache, nausea, abdominal pain, rash, arthropathy (joint pain), back pain, pain in the limbs (in hands and feet), heat feeling, fever and reactions at the infusion point.</seg>
<seg id="2280">Very common side effects in patients under five years are elevated blood pressure, reduced oxygen saturation (a measurement of lung function), tachycardia (accelerated heart rate), fever and chills.</seg>
<seg id="2281">Aldurazyme may not be used in patients who possibly react strongly hypersensitive (allergic) to laronidase or any of the other components (anaphylactic reaction).</seg>
<seg id="2282">The European Medicines Agency (EMEA) will review every year any new information that may be known, and where necessary update this summary.</seg>
<seg id="2283">The manufacturer of Aldurazyme will observe patients who receive althirazyms in response to the reactions to the infusion and the development of antibodies.</seg>
<seg id="2284">In June 2003, the European Commission issued a permit to the company Genzyme Europe B.V. for the placing on the market of Aldurazyme throughout the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2285">Laronidase is a recombinant form of human α-L-Iduronidase and is produced using recombinant DNA technology using CHO mammalian cell cultures (Chinese hamster Ovary, ovary of the Chinese hamster).</seg>
<seg id="2286">Aldurazyme is indicated for long-term enzyme therapy in patients with a confirmed diagnosis of a Mucopolysaccharidosis I (MPS I, α -L-Iduronidase deficiency) in order to treat the non-neurological manifestations of the disease (see Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2287">Treatment with Aldurazyme should be performed by a doctor who has experience in the treatment of patients with MPS I or other inherited metabolic diseases.</seg>
<seg id="2288">The initial infusion rate of 2 E / kg / h can be increased every 15 minutes in individual steps to a maximum dose of 43 E / kg / h.</seg>
<seg id="2289">The safety and efficacy of Aldurazyme in adults over 65 years has not been determined, and no dosing schedule can be recommended for these patients.</seg>
<seg id="2290">The safety and efficacy of Aldurazyme in patients with kidney or liver insufficiency has not been determined, and no dosing schedule can be recommended for these patients.</seg>
<seg id="2291">Patients treated with Aldurazyme can develop infusion-related reactions defined as any side effect that occurs during infusion or until the end of the infusion (see Section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="2292">For this reason, especially these patients should continue to be closely monitored, and the infusion of Aldurazyme should only be carried out in an appropriate clinical environment in which revitalizing facilities for medical emergencies are immediately available.</seg>
<seg id="2293">Due to the clinical phase 3 study, nearly all patients with IgG antibodies against laronidase are expected to develop normally within 3 months from the beginning of treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2294">Patients who develop antibodies or symptoms of infusion-related reactions must be treated with caution when using althirazyms (see Sections 4.3 and 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="2295">Since there is little experience regarding resumption of treatment after a longer break, the risk of hypersensitivity reactions must be cautiously performed after an interruption of the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2296">60 minutes before the start of infusion with medication (antihistamines and / or antipyretic) to be treated in order to minimize the potential occurrence of infusion-related reactions.</seg>
<seg id="2297">In the event of a mild or moderate infusion-related reaction, the treatment with antihistaminika and paracetamol / ibuprofen should be considered and / or a reduction of the infusion rate to the half of the infusion rate in which the reaction occurred.</seg>
<seg id="2298">In case of a single serious infusion-related reaction, the infusion needs to be stopped until the symptoms are reduced, a treatment with antihistaminika and paracetamol / ibuprofen is to be considered.</seg>
<seg id="2299">Infusion can be resumed with a reduction of the infusion rate to 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of the infusion rate in which the reaction occurred.</seg>
<seg id="2300">3 are (antihistamines and paracetamol / ibuprofen and / or corticosteroids) as well as a reduction of the infusion rate to 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of the infusion rate in which the preceding reaction has occurred.</seg>
<seg id="2301">Aldurazyme should not be used at the same time with chloroquin or procain because there is a potential risk of interference with intracellular intracellular absorption of larynidase.</seg>
<seg id="2302">Animal experimental studies do not permit direct or indirect harmful effects on pregnancy, which include embryonic / fetal development, birth and postnatal development (see section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2303">Since there are no data on newborns exposed to laronidase over breast milk, it is recommended to not breastfeed during treatment with Aldurazyme.</seg>
<seg id="2304">Adverse events in clinical trials were mainly classified as infusion-related reactions, which were observed in 53% of patients in the Phase 3 study (duration of treatment up to 4 years) and 35% of patients in the study with participants under 5 years (duration of treatment up to 1 year).</seg>
<seg id="2305">Adverse drug reactions in connection with Aldurazyme observed during the phase 3 study and its extension in a total of 45 patients at the age of 5 years or older at a treatment period of up to 4 years are listed in the following table following the following frequency (≥ 1 / 10); often (≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10).</seg>
<seg id="2306">In some patients with severe MPS-I-conditioned involvement of the upper respiratory tract and lungs in the prehistory, severe reactions also occurred, including bronchospasm, respiratory failure and facial oil (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2307">Children Unwanted drug effects related to Aldurazyme, which were reported during a phase 2 study with a total of 20 patients aged under 5, with predominantly severe transitioning form and treatment duration up to 12 months, are listed in the table.</seg>
<seg id="2308">100 E / kg intravenously once weekly (recommended dose), 200 E / kg intravenously once weekly, 200 E / kg intravenously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intravenously every 2 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="2309">In most patients, a seroconversion occurred within 3 months after the beginning of the treatment, with a more severe form of deformation usually within one month (average after 26 days compared to 45 days in patients at the age of 5 years and over).</seg>
<seg id="2310">Until the end of the phase 3 study (or up to a premature ejection from the study), 13 / 45 patients were unable to produce detectable antibodies by radioimmunosuppression (RIP), among them 3 patients who never came to Serokonose.</seg>
<seg id="2311">Patients with a lack of low antibody levels showed a robust reduction in the GAG mirror in urine, while in patients with high antibody titers a variable reduction of GAG was detected in urine.</seg>
<seg id="2312">Four patients (three in phase 3 study and one in phase 2 study) showed a marginal to low neutralizing inhibitory effect on enzymatic laronidase activity in vitro that did not impair clinical efficacy and / or reduction of GAG in urine.</seg>
<seg id="2313">The presence of antibodies did not appear to be associated with the incidence of adverse drug reactions, even though the incidence of adverse drug reactions typically coincided with the formation of IgG antibodies.</seg>
<seg id="2314">The reason for enzymatic therapy is one of the hydrolysis of the accumulated substrat and the prevention of further accumulation of sufficient restoration of enzyme activity.</seg>
<seg id="2315">After intravenous infusion, Laronidase is quickly removed from the circulation and absorbed by cells into the Lysosomes, most likely with manose-6 phosphate receptors.</seg>
<seg id="2316">The safety and efficacy of Aldurazyme were studied in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 3 study involving 45 patients aged 6 to 43.</seg>
<seg id="2317">Although patients were recruited for the study, which showed the entire spectrum of their disease, the majority of patients had the mean phenotype and only one patient had the severe phenotype.</seg>
<seg id="2318">Patients were recruited if they had an accelerated expiratory volume (FeV) of less than 80% of the expected value, and they had to be able to stand 6 minutes and walk 5 meters.</seg>
<seg id="2319">The primary endpoints for the efficacy were the percentage change of the expected FeV and the absolute distance in the 6-minute walk.</seg>
<seg id="2320">All patients were subsequently recruited for an open label extension study, where they received 100 E / kg of Aldurazyme for another 3.5 years (182 weeks) each week.</seg>
<seg id="2321">After 26 weeks of therapy, patients treated with Aldurazyme showed an improvement in lung function and salviability compared to placebo in the following table.</seg>
<seg id="2322">The open extension study showed an improvement and / or maintenance of these effects of up to 208 weeks in the Aldurazyme / Aldurazyme group and 182 weeks in the placebo / Aldurazyme group, as shown in the following table.</seg>
<seg id="2323">The decrease in the expected percentage of FeV is clinically not clinically significant over this period and the absolute lung volumes increased further proportionately to the body size of growing children.</seg>
<seg id="2324">Of the 26 patients with a Hepatomegaly before treatment, 22 (85%) reached a normal liver size by the end of the trial.</seg>
<seg id="2325">Within the first 4 weeks a clear waste from the GAG-Spiegel was found in the urine (µg / mg of Kreatinin), which remained constant until the end of the study.</seg>
<seg id="2326">With regard to the heterogeneous disease manifestation between patients taking into account clinically significant changes across five efficacy-variables (expected percentage of normal feV, distance in the 6-minute walk, range of movement of the shoulder joint AHI and visual acuity), there was generally an improvement in 26 patients (58%), no change in 10 patients (22%) and a worsening in 9 patients (20%).</seg>
<seg id="2327">A one-year open phase 2 trial was conducted where the safety and pharmacokinetics of Aldurazyme were investigated in 20 patients at the time of their inclusion in the study under 5 years (16 patients with severe form and 4 with the mean follow-up).</seg>
<seg id="2328">In four patients the dosage was increased to 200 E / kg due to increased Gag- Mirror in urine in week 22.</seg>
<seg id="2329">In several patients, a growth rate (n = 7) and a weight gain (n = 3) were determined by the Z-Score for this age group. the younger patients with a severe disease form (&lt; 2.5 years) and all 4 patients with the middle course form showed a normal mental development speed, whereas in older patients with severe transitioning only limited or even no progress in cognitive development was observed.</seg>
<seg id="2330">In a phase 4 study, studies on pharmacocodynamic effects of different Aldurazyme dosage schemes were performed on the GAG-Spiegel in the urine, the liver volume and the 6-minute walk test.</seg>
<seg id="2331">100 E / kg intravenously once weekly (recommended dose), 200 E / kg intravenously once weekly, 200 E / kg intravenously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intravenously every 2 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="2332">The dosage schedule with 200 E / kg intravenous every 2 weeks can represent a reasonable alternative in patients who have difficulties with weekly infusions; however, it is not proven that the long-term clinical effectiveness of these two dosage schemes is equivalent.</seg>
<seg id="2333">The European Medicines Agency (EMEA) will evaluate any new information available annually, and if necessary, the summary of the features of the drug will be updated.</seg>
<seg id="2334">The pharmacokinetic profile of patients at the age of 5 years was similar to that of elderly and less severely affected patients.</seg>
<seg id="2335">Based on conventional studies on safety harmacology, toxicity with a unique gift, toxicity in repeated administration and reproductive toxicity, preclinical data can not detect any particular dangers to humans.</seg>
<seg id="2336">Since no compatibility studies have been carried out, this drug may not be mixed with other medicines except those listed under 6.</seg>

<seg id="2354">Alimta is used together with Cisplatin (another medicine against cancer) in patients who have not received chemotherapy (medicine against cancer) and "maligne" (malignant - cancer has already spread to other parts of the body) and is likely to spread easily on other parts of the body.</seg>
<seg id="2355">Alimta is used in patients who have not been treated before, in combination with cisplatin and in patients who have previously received other chemotherapies as sole therapy.</seg>
<seg id="2356">To reduce side effects, the patients should take a corticosteroid as well as folic acid (a vitamin) during treatment with AlimTA and receive injections of vitamin B12.</seg>
<seg id="2357">If Alimta is administered together with cisplatin, an anti-emetic drug should be given before or after the administration of cisplatin (medicines for vomiting) and liquids (to prevent a lack of fluids).</seg>
<seg id="2358">In patients whose blood pattern changes or where certain other side effects occur, the treatment should be postponed, deposed or the dose should be reduced.</seg>
<seg id="2359">The active form of pemetrexed thus slows the formation of DNA and RNA and prevents the cells from sharing.</seg>
<seg id="2360">The conversion of pemetremixed into its active form is more readily available in cancer cells than in healthy cells, leading to higher concentrations of the active form of the drug and a longer period of time in cancer cells.</seg>
<seg id="2361">For the treatment of the malignant pleural epithelium, Alimta was examined in a main study of 456 patients who had previously not received chemotherapy against their disease.</seg>
<seg id="2362">In the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer, the effects of Alimta were compared to 571 patients with locally advanced or metastatic disease previously treated with chemotherapy, with the effects of docetaxel (another drug against cancer).</seg>
<seg id="2363">Alimta was also compared to gemcitabine (another cancer drug), both in combination with cisplatin in 1 725 patients who had previously not received chemotherapy for lung cancer.</seg>
<seg id="2364">Patients treated with Alimta and Cisplatin lived an average of 12.1 months, compared to 9.3 months in the sole administration of cisplatin.</seg>
<seg id="2365">In patients who had previously received chemotherapy, the mean survival time with AlimTA was 8.3 months, compared with 7.9 months in docetaxel.</seg>
<seg id="2366">In both studies, however, patients in which the cancer did not attack the squamous cell cells reported longer survival times in the administration of AlimTA than with the comparison medication.</seg>
<seg id="2367">In September 2004, the European Commission issued a permit to the company Eli Lilly Nederland B.V. for the placing on the market of Alimta across the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2368">Each water bottle has to be dissolved with 4.2 ml 0.9% sodium chloride injection solution (9 mg / ml), resulting in a solution of 25 mg / ml.</seg>
<seg id="2369">The corresponding volume of the necessary dose is taken from the water bottle and diluted with 0.9% sodium chloride injection solution (9 mg / ml) to 100 ml (see section 6.6).</seg>
<seg id="2370">ALIMTA is indicated in combination with cisplatin for first-line treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic non-small cell bronchial carcinoma (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2371">ALIMTA in monotherapy is indicated for the treatment in second-line treatment of patients with loc-, advanced or metastatic non-small cell bronchial carcinoma (see Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2372">The recommended dose of ALIMTA 500 mg / m ² body surface area (KOF) is administered as intravenous infusion for a period of 10 minutes on the first day of every 21 day treatment cycle.</seg>
<seg id="2373">The recommended dose of cisplatin is 75 mg / m ² KOF as infusion for a period of 2 hours approximately 30 minutes after completion of the pemetrexed- infusion on the first day every 21 day treatment cycle.</seg>
<seg id="2374">In patients with non-small cell lung cancer following previous chemotherapy, the recommended dose of ALIMTA 500 mg / m ² KOF is administered as intravenous infusion for a period of 10 minutes on the first day of every 21 day treatment cycle.</seg>
<seg id="2375">To reduce the frequency and severity of skin reactions, a corticosteroid must be given on the day before and on the day of the pemetremixed dosage and on the day after the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2376">During the seven days before the first dose of pemetremixed, at least 5 doses of folic acid must be taken and the dose should be continued throughout the therapy period and for another 21 days after the last dose of pemetrexed- dosage.</seg>
<seg id="2377">Patients must also receive an intramuscular injection of vitamin B12 (1000 micrograms) in the week before the first mixed dose and after each third treatment cycle.</seg>
<seg id="2378">In patients who receive pemetrexed, a complete blood-image should be created before each gift, including a differentiation of the leukocytes and a thrombocyte counting.</seg>
<seg id="2379">The alkaline phosphatase (AP), aspartate transaminase (AST or SGOT) and Alanine transaminase (ALT or SGPT) should be ≤ 3 times the upper limit value.</seg>
<seg id="2380">At the beginning of a new treatment cycle, a dose check has to take place considering the Nadir of the blood image or the maximum non-hematological toxicity of the previous therapy cycles.</seg>
<seg id="2381">After recovery, patients must be treated in accordance with the indications in the tables 1, 2 and 3, which are to be used for ALIMTA as monotherapy or in combination with cisplatin.</seg>
<seg id="2382">These criteria correspond to the definition of the National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria (CTC v2.0; NCI 1998) ≥ CTC degrade 2 bleeding.</seg>
<seg id="2383">Should patients not develop haematological toxicity ≥ degree 3 (except neurotoxicity), the therapy must be interrupted with ALIMTA until the patient has the value prior to treatment</seg>
<seg id="2384">Treatment with ALIMTA must be stopped when in patients after 2 dosages a haematological toxicity or non-hematological toxicity degree 3 or 4 occurs or so- proceeds on the occurrence of Grade 3 or 4 neurotoxicity.</seg>
<seg id="2385">Clinical studies showed no indication that there is an increased risk of side effects in patients aged 65 years or older than 65 years of age.</seg>
<seg id="2386">ALIMTA is not recommended for use in children under 18 years of age due to insufficient data on safety and efficacy.</seg>
<seg id="2387">In clinical trials, dose adaptations for patients with a creatine clearance of ≥ 45 ml / min were not necessary, which go beyond the dose adaptation recommended for all patients.</seg>
<seg id="2388">The data situation in patients with a creatine clearance of less than 45 ml / min was not sufficient; therefore the application is not recommended (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2389">However, patients with a liver function restriction of &gt; 1.5-fold of the upper Bilirubins- boundary value and / or transaminase values of &gt; 5.0-fold the upper limit value (in the presence of liver metastases) were not studied especially in the studies.</seg>
<seg id="2390">Patients must be monitored with regard to bone marital immunosuppression and pemetrexed should not be given to patients before their absolute neutrino number has again reached a value of ≥ 1,500 cells / mm ³ and the thrombo- cyte-count again a value of ≥ 100,000 cells / mm ³.</seg>
<seg id="2391">A dose reduction for further cycles is based on the Nadir of absolute neutrophils, thrombocyte numbers and maximum non-hematological toxicity as observed in previous treatment cycles (see section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="2392">A lower toxicity and a reduction of grade 3 / 4 hematological and nithatological toxicity such as neutropenia, febrile neutropenia and infection with grade 3 / 4 neutropenia has been studio- or disregarded as a pretreatment with folic acid and vitamin B12 had taken place.</seg>
<seg id="2393">Therefore, all patients treated with Pemetrexed must be advised to use folic acid and vitamin B12 as a prophylactic measure to reduce treatment-related toxicity (see section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="2394">Patients with mild to moderate renal insufficiency (Creatinin-Clearance 45 to 79 ml / min) must avoid simultaneous use of nonsteroidal antiphlogistica (NSAIDs) such as ibuprofen and acetylsalivary (&gt; 1,3 g daily) for at least 2 days prior to therapy, on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after therapy with pemetremixed (see Section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2395">All patients with pemetrexed therapy must avoid taking NSAIDs with long half-life for at least 5 days prior to the therapy, on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after therapy with pemetrexed (see Section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2396">Many patients in which these events occurred had corresponding risk factors for the occurrence of renal events, including dehydration, pre-existing high blood pressure or diabetes.</seg>
<seg id="2397">Therefore, a drainage of the effusion before the pemetremixed treatment should be considered in patients with clinically significant fluid retention in the transformerellular space.</seg>
<seg id="2398">5 major cardiovascular events, including myocardial infarction, and cerebrovascular events were occasionally reported in clinical studies with pemetrexed, if this substance was usually given in combination with another cytotoxic agent.</seg>
<seg id="2399">For this reason, the simultaneous use of attenuated live vaccine (except yellow fever, this vaccination is contraindicated) is not recommended (see Section 4.3 and 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2400">Since the possibility of an irreversible damage to reproductive ability by pemetrexed, men should be advised prior to the treatment in order to obtain advice on the preservation of sperm.</seg>
<seg id="2401">In patients with normal renal function (creatine clearance ≥ 80 ml / min) high doses of nonsteroidal antiphlogistica (NSAIDs, such as ibuprofen &gt; 1600 mg / day) and acetylsalicylic acid in high dosages (≥ 1.3 g daily) can result in a reduced Pemetrexed excretion with the consequence of increased occurrence of side effects.</seg>
<seg id="2402">It is therefore advisable to use high doses of NSAIDs or asce- tylsalicylic acid in high doses if patients with normal renal function (creatine clearance ≥ 80 ml / min) are recommended.</seg>
<seg id="2403">Ibuprofen) or acetylsalicylic acid in high dosage for at least 2 days prior to therapy, be avoided on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after therapy with pemetremixed (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2404">Since there is no data regarding the interaction potential with NSAIDs, with long half-life such as Piro- xicam or Rofecoxib, the simultaneous use of pemetrexed must be avoided at least 5 days prior to the therapy, on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after therapy with pemetre- xed.</seg>
<seg id="2405">The large intra-individual variability of coagulation status during the disease and the possibility of interactions between oral anticoagulants and antineoplastic chemotherapy requires an increased monitoring frequency of INR (International Normalized Ratio) if the decision was made to treat the patient with oral anticoagulants.</seg>
<seg id="2406">There are no data for the use of pemetrexed in pregnant women, but as with decent antimetabolites, severe birth defects are expected in pregnancy.</seg>
<seg id="2407">Pemetrexed should not be used during pregnancy, except if it is essential and after careful consideration of the benefits for the mother and the risk of fetus (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2408">Since the possibility of an irreversible damage to reproductive ability by pemetrexed, men should be advised prior to the beginning of treatment to obtain advice regarding the sperm count.</seg>
<seg id="2409">It is not known whether pemetrexed is passed into the breast milk and unwanted effects on breastfeeding infant cannot be ruled out.</seg>
<seg id="2410">The following table shows the frequency and severity of adverse events reported in &gt; 5% of 168 patients with mesothelioma and the randomized cisplatin and pemetremixed - as well as 163 patients with mesothelioma, which randomized cisplatin received as monotherapy.</seg>

<seg id="2419">Clinically relevant laboratory toxicity grade 3 and 4 was similar to phase 2 combined with three individual pemetremixed mono therapy studies (n = 164), excluding neutropenia (12.8% compared to 5.3%) and an increase in alanine transaminase (15.2% compared to 1.9%).</seg>
<seg id="2420">These differences are likely to be traced back to differences in the patient population because the phasis 2 studies included both chemonaive and significantly pre-treated breast cancer patients with existing liver metastases and / or abnormal initial values of liver function tests.</seg>

<seg id="2430">Cases of radiation pneumonitis were reported in patients before, during or after their pemetrexed therapy (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2431">ALIMTA (Pemetremixed) is an antineoplastic anti-folate which exercises its effect by breaking sandwich-dependent metabolic processes necessary for cell replication.</seg>
<seg id="2432">In vitro studies showed that pemetrexed acts as an anti-folate with multiple targets by blocking the thymidylatin synthase (TS), Dihydrological reductase (DHFR) and Glycinamidribonucleotidfor- myltransferase (GARFT), which are key-dependent key enzymes of the de novo biosynthesis of thymid- and purinnucleotides.</seg>
<seg id="2433">EMPHACIS, a multicenter, randomized, single-blind phase 3 study of ALIMTA plus cisplatin against cisplatin in chemonaive patients with malignant pleural mesothelioma showed that patients treated with ALIMTA and Cisplatin had a clinically significant advantage of survival compared to those patients who were only treated with Cisplatin.</seg>
<seg id="2434">Primary analysis of this study was carried out in the population of all patients receiving test medication in the treatment arm (randomised and treated).</seg>
<seg id="2435">A statistically significant improvement in the clinically relevant symptoms (pain and dyspnea) in connection with malignant pleuramesothelioma was shown in the ALIMTA / Cisplatin arm (212 patients) compared to the sole cisplatin arm (218 patients).</seg>
<seg id="2436">The differences between the two treatment arms resulted in improved lung function parameters in the ALIMTA / Cisplatin arm and a worse of lung function over time in the control arm.</seg>
<seg id="2437">A multi-centre, randomised, open phase III study with ALIMTA in patients with locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC showed median survival of 8.3 months in patients treated with ALIMTA (Intent to treat population n = 283) and 7.9 months in patients treated with docetaxel (ITT n = 288).</seg>
<seg id="2438">An analysis of the influence of histology on the treatment effect on overall survival fell in favour of ALIMTA in patients with NSCLC with a predominantly non-plate epithelial histological type (n = 0.78; 95% CI = 0.61-1.00, p = 0.047; 95% CI = 1.08-2,26, p = 0.018).</seg>

<seg id="2503">It is used for overweight adults with a body mass index (BMI) ≥ 28 kg per square meter combined with low-calorie, fat-reduced nutrition.</seg>
<seg id="2504">Patients who are taking Alli and who are not able to lose weight after 12 weeks should contact their doctor or pharmacist.</seg>
<seg id="2505">If these enzymes are inhibited, they cannot metabolise some fats in the food, which causes about a quarter of the fats attributed to food undigested the intestines.</seg>
<seg id="2506">In a third study, Alli was compared to 391 overweight patients with a BMI between 25 and 28 kg / m2 with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="2507">In both studies, patients with BMI ≥ 28 kg / m2 had an average weight loss of 4.8 kg after one year, compared to 2.3 kg when taking placebo.</seg>
<seg id="2508">In the study with Alli in patients with a BMI between 25 and 28 kg / m2 no weight loss could be observed for patients.</seg>
<seg id="2509">The most common side effects of Alli (observed in more than 1 of 10 patients) are oily spots on anus, flatus (winds) with stucco duct, chair pull, oily / oily chair, finish oily sections (rotting), flatulence (winds) and soft chairs.</seg>
<seg id="2510">It should not be used in patients who are treated with Ciclosporin (to prevent organ rejection in transplants) or with medicines such as warfarin to prevent blood clots.</seg>
<seg id="2511">It must also not be used in patients suffering from long-term malabsorption syndrome (where not enough nutrients are absorbed from the digestive tract) or cholestase (liver disease), and in pregnant women or in breast-feeding mothers.</seg>
<seg id="2512">In July 2007, the European Commission issued a permit to Glaxo Group Limited for placing orlistat GSK in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2513">Alli is indicated for weight reduction of adults with overweight (Body-Mass-Index BMI ≥ 28 kg / m2) and should be applied in conjunction with a slightly hypokaloric, low-fat diet.</seg>
<seg id="2514">Alli must not be used by children and adolescents under the age of 18, as there are insufficient data on efficacy and safety.</seg>
<seg id="2515">As orlistat is only moderately resorbed, elderly people and patients with reduced liver and / or kidney function do not require adjusting the dosage.</seg>
<seg id="2516">Hypersensitivity to the active ingredient or any of the other ingredients • Simultaneous treatment with Ciclosporin (see Section 4.6) • Still time (see section 4.6) • Still time (see Section 4.6) • Simultaneous treatment with warfarin or other oral anticoagulants (see Sections 4.5 and 4.8)</seg>
<seg id="2517">The likelihood of occurrence of gastrointestinal symptoms (see Section 4.8) may increase if alli is taken together with a fat-rich single meal or fat-rich diet.</seg>
<seg id="2518">As weight reduction in diabetes can be associated with improved metabolic monitoring, patients who take a medicine against diabetes should consult a doctor or pharmacist before starting a therapy with alli, because the dosage of antidiabetic medicine needs to be adjusted.</seg>
<seg id="2519">Patients who use alli as well as medicines for high blood pressure or increased cholesterol should consult their doctor or pharmacist if the dosage needs to be adapted.</seg>
<seg id="2520">It is recommended to take additional fluctuating measures in order to prevent the possible failure of oral contraception in case of severe diarrhoea (see Section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2521">Both in a study on the interactions of drugs and in several cases with simultaneous use of orlistat and Ciclosporin a lowering of the Ciclosporin plasma was observed.</seg>
<seg id="2522">In the application of warfarin or other oral anticoagulants in combination with orlistat the Quick values (international normal ratio, INR) could be influenced (see Section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="2523">In most patients who have been treated with orlistat in clinical trials up to 4 full years, the concentrations of vitamins A, D, E and K as well as the beta carotene remain in the normal range.</seg>
<seg id="2524">However, the patient should be advised to take a supplementary multivitamin supplement before bedtime to ensure sufficient vitamin intake (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2525">After the addition of a single dose of Amiodarone a minor decrease of the Amiodarone plasma concentration was observed with a limited number of healthy volunteers who received orlistat at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="2526">Animal experimental studies showed no direct or indirect effects on pregnancy, embryonic / fetal development, birth or postnatal development (see section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2527">The side effects of orlistat are mainly gastrointestinal nature and are related to the pharmacological effect of the drug, as the absorption of captured fat is prevented.</seg>
<seg id="2528">The gastrointestinal side effects were determined from clinical studies with orlistat 60 mg over a period of 18 months to 2 years and were generally mild and temporary.</seg>
<seg id="2529">The frequency is defined as follows: very often (≥ 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 10), occasionally (≥ 1 / 1000, &lt; 1 / 100), rarely (≥ 1 / 10,000, &lt; 1 / 1000) and very rare (&lt; 1 / 10), not known (frequency based on available data cannot be estimated).</seg>
<seg id="2530">The frequency of the reported side effects reported after the market launch of orlistat is not known as these events were voluntarily reported by a population of uncertain magnitude.</seg>
<seg id="2531">† It is plausible that treatment with alli may lead to anxiety regarding possible or actual gastrointestinal side effects.</seg>
<seg id="2532">Single doses of 800 mg orlistat and multiple doses of up to 400 mg three times a day were administered over a period of 15 days in normal and obese subjects without significant clinical findings.</seg>
<seg id="2533">In the majority of cases of orlistat overdose reported after the market launch, no side effects or similar side effects were reported as reported at the recommended dose of orlistat.</seg>
<seg id="2534">Based on human and animal studies, a rapid recovery of any systemic effects caused by the lipid properties of orlistat can be assumed.</seg>
<seg id="2535">The therapeutic effect is applied in the lumen of the stomach and the upper small intestine through covalent bonding to the active serine-rest of gastric and ankreous lipass.</seg>
<seg id="2536">From clinical studies it was derived that 60 mg orlistat, taken three times a day, blocked the absorption of about 25% of the food fat.</seg>
<seg id="2537">Two double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled trials in adults with a BMI ≥ 28 kg / m2 substantiate the efficacy of 60 mg orlistat, which was taken three times a day in combination with a hypokaloric, fetal diet.</seg>
<seg id="2538">The primary parameter that changes the body weight compared to the initial value (at the time of randomisation) was assessed as follows: as a change in body weight in the course of study (table 1) and as a percentage of those participating in the study, which have lost more than 5% or more than 10% of their initial weight (Table 2).</seg>
<seg id="2539">Although the weight reduction was observed over 12 months in both studies, the greatest weight loss occurred in the first 6 months.</seg>
<seg id="2540">The average cholesterol in the total cholesterol was 60 mg -2.4% with orlistat (initial value 5,20 mmol / l) and with placebo + 2.8% (initial value 5,26 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="2541">The average change in LDL cholesterol was with orlistat 60 mg -3,5% (initial value 3,30 mmol / l) and with placebo + 3.8% (initial value 3,41 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="2542">At the waist circumference, the average change was -4.5 cm with orlistat 60 mg (initial value 103.7 cm) and with placebo -3.6 cm (initial value 103.5 cm).</seg>
<seg id="2543">Plasma concentrations of non-metabolized orlistat were not measurable 8 hours after the oral administration of 360 mg orlistat (&lt; 5 ng / ml).</seg>
<seg id="2544">7 In general, not metabolized orlistat in plasma could be detected sporadically and at extremely low concentrations (&lt; 10 ng / ml or 0.02 µmol) and without signs of cumulation.</seg>
<seg id="2545">In a study with obese patients who administered the minimal systemic resorbiated dose, two main metabolites, namely M1 (in position 4 hydrolysed Lactonring) and M3 (M1 after splitting the N-formed leucine group), were identified, which represented approximately 42% of total plasma concentration.</seg>
<seg id="2546">Based on conventional studies on safety harmacology, toxicity in repeated application, genotoxicity, carcinogenic potential and reproductive toxicity, preclinical data do not reveal any particular danger to humans.</seg>

<seg id="2571">If you have a meal or a meal no fat contains, take no capsule. alli can only work if the food contains fat.</seg>
<seg id="2572">If you take the capsule in conjunction with a meal that contains too much fat, you risk diet-related accompanying symptoms (see Section 4).</seg>
<seg id="2573">To get used to the new eating habits, start with a calorie and fat reduction diet prior to the first capsule intake.</seg>
<seg id="2574">Nutritional diaries are effective as you can understand what you eat, how much you eat and it will probably be easier for you to change your dietary habits.</seg>
<seg id="2575">In order to achieve your target weight safely, you should set two daily targets in advance: one for the calories and one for fat.</seg>
<seg id="2576">• Use fat to reduce the likelihood of diet-related companion appearances (see Section 4). • Try to move more before you start taking the capsules.</seg>
<seg id="2577">Remember to ask your doctor beforehand if you are not used to physical exercise. • Stay while taking and after taking alli physically active.</seg>

<seg id="2586">Please inform your doctor or pharmacist if any of the side effects listed below may significantly impair you or notice any side effects that are not indicated in this information.</seg>
<seg id="2587">The most common side effects are related to the mode of action of the capsules and result in increased fat from the body.</seg>
<seg id="2588">These side effects usually occur within the first weeks of the treatment beginning, as you may have not consistently reduced the fat percentage in your diet.</seg>
<seg id="2589">With the following basic rules you can learn to minimize the nutritional benefits: • Start some days, or better a week before taking capsules with a fetal diet. • Learn more about the usual fat content of your favorite foods and about the size of portions you normally take.</seg>
<seg id="2590">If you know exactly how much you eat, the likelihood that you exceed your fat limit will decrease. • Share your recommended amount of fat evenly on daily meals.</seg>
<seg id="2591">Save the amount of calories and fat that you are allowed to take per meal, not to take them in the form of a fat-rich main dish or a substantial nightstand, as you may have done with other programs for weight reduction. • Most people with those accompanying symptoms learn to control them with time by adjusting their diet.</seg>
<seg id="2592">• Do not store the medicine for children. • Do not use any more than 25 ° C after the expiry date stated on the box. • Do not store the container tightly to protect the contents from moisture. • The bottle contains two white sealed containers with silica gel that serve to keep the capsules dry.</seg>

<seg id="2597">Choose meals that include a wide range of nutrients, and gradually learn to eat healthily.</seg>
<seg id="2598">Energy is also measured in kilojoules, which you can also find as an indication of the food packaging. • The recommended calorie intake indicates how many calories you should take maximum per day.</seg>
<seg id="2599">Keep in mind the tables below in this section. • The recommended fat intake in grams is the maximum amount of fat that you should take with each meal.</seg>
<seg id="2600">The amount of calories suitable for you can be found in the information below indicating the number of calories suitable for you. • Due to the capsule's mode of action, adherence to the recommended fat intake is crucial.</seg>
<seg id="2601">If you take the same amount of fat as before, this can mean that your body cannot process this amount of fat.</seg>
<seg id="2602">By adhering to the recommended fat intake, you can maximise weight loss and at the same time reduce the likelihood of diet-related companion appearances. • You should try to gradually lose weight.</seg>
<seg id="2603">34 This reduced calorie intake should allow you to gradually and continuously lose about 0.5 kg per week in weight without developing frustration and disappointments.</seg>
<seg id="2604">The more active you are, the higher your recommended calorie intake. • "Low physical activity" means that you do not walk daily, climb stairs, work in the garden or perform other physical activities. • "Medium physical activity" means that you burn 150 kcal daily by exercise, e.g. by 3 km walking, 30 to 45 minutes of gardening or 2 km running in 15 minutes.</seg>
<seg id="2605">• For a lasting weight loss, it is necessary to set realistic calorie and fat targets and adhere to them. • A nutritional diary with information about the calorie and fat content of your meals. • Try to move more before you start taking alli.</seg>

<seg id="2608">Aloxi is used in chemotherapy, the strong trigger for nausea and vomiting (such as cisplatin), as well as in chemotherapies, which are the moderate trigger for nausea and vomiting (such as cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin or carboplatin).</seg>
<seg id="2609">The efficacy of Aloxi can be increased by adding a corticosteroids (a medicine used as an anti-emetic drug).</seg>
<seg id="2610">The use in patients under 18 years of age is not recommended, because there is not enough information on the effects of this age group.</seg>
<seg id="2611">This means that the active ingredient inhibits the binding of a chemical substance in the body, 5-hydroxytryptamin (5HT, also known as serotonin) to the receptors in the intestine.</seg>
<seg id="2612">In three main studies, Aloxi was studied at 1 842 adults who received chemotherapy, which are strong respectively moderate causes of nausea and vomiting.</seg>
<seg id="2613">In chemotherapies, which are strong trigger for nausea and vomiting, 59% of patients treated with alopal showed no vomiting in the 24 hours after chemotherapy (132 of 223), compared to 57% of patients treated with ondansetron (126 of 221).</seg>
<seg id="2614">In the case of chemotherapies, the moderate nausea and vomiting triggers, 81% of patients who were treated with alopal showed no vomiting in the 24 hours after chemotherapy (153 of 189), compared to 69% of patients treated with ondansetron (127 from 185).</seg>
<seg id="2615">In a comparison with Dolasetron these values were 63% for Aloxi (119 of 189 patients) and 53% for Dolasetron (101 of 191 patients).</seg>
<seg id="2616">In March 2005, the European Commission issued approval for the transport of Aloxi in the entire European Union to the company of Helsinki Birex Pharmaceuticals Ltd.</seg>
<seg id="2617">Alohxi is indicated for prevention of acute nausea and vomiting in strongly emetogenic chemotherapy as a result of cancer and for the prevention of nausea and vomiting in moderately emetogenic chemotherapy due to cancer.</seg>
<seg id="2618">The efficacy of Aloxi for the prevention of nausea and vomiting caused by a strongly emetogenic chemotherapy can be amplified by adding a corticosteroids given before chemotherapy.</seg>
<seg id="2619">Since Palonosetron can prolong the colon massage, patients should be closely monitored with anamnestical obstructions or signs of an acute Ileus after injection.</seg>
<seg id="2620">However, as with other 5HT3 antagonists, caution is required with simultaneous dispensing of palonosetron with medicines that extend the QT interval or in patients with which the Qt interval is extended or which tend to such an extension.</seg>
<seg id="2621">In addition to a further chemotherapeutic application, Aloxi is not to be used for prevention or treatment of nausea and vomiting in the days following chemotherapy.</seg>
<seg id="2622">In preclinical studies, palonosetron inhibited the activity of the five chemotherapeutics investigated against tumors (cisplatin, cyclophosphamide, cytarabin, doxorubicin and Mitomycin C).</seg>
<seg id="2623">In a clinical study there was no significant pharmacokinetical interaction between a single intravenous dose Palonosetron and a Steady State- Concentration of oral Metoclopraids, a CYP2D6 inhibitor.</seg>
<seg id="2624">In a pharmacokinetic analysis based on a population, the simultaneous administration of CYP2D6 inductors (dexamethasone and rifampicin) as well as CYP2D6 inhibitors (amethasone, doxorubicin, fluoxetine, ranitidine, kritonavir, sertraline and terbinafine) had no significant effect on the Clearance of Palonosetron.</seg>
<seg id="2625">Experience of using Palonosetron in human pregnancies is not available, so Palonosetron should not be used in pregnant women unless it is deemed necessary by the treating physician.</seg>
<seg id="2626">In clinical studies, the most common adverse events in a dose of 250 micrograms (total of 633 patients) were headaches (9%) and obstipation (5%).</seg>
<seg id="2627">Very rare cases (&lt; 1 / 10,000) of hypersensitivity reactions and reactions to the date of delivery (burning, hardening, discomfort and pain) were reported in post-marketing experience reports.</seg>
<seg id="2628">In the group with the highest dosage there were similar occurrences of adverse events as in the other dosage groups; there were no dose-effects to observe.</seg>
<seg id="2629">No dialysis studies were carried out, but due to the large distribution volume, dialysis is probably not an effective therapy for an alopia overdose.</seg>
<seg id="2630">In two randomised double blind studies, a total of 1,132 patients receiving a moderately emetogenic chemotherapy received ≤ 50 mg / m2 cyclophosphamide and &gt; 25 mg / m2 cyclophosphamide and &gt; 25 mg / m2 cycloasetron (half-life 7.3 hours), given on day 1 without dexamethasone intravenously.</seg>
<seg id="2631">In a randomized double blind study, a total of 667 patients receiving a strongly emetogenic chemotherapy with ≥ 60 mg / m2 cyclophosphamide and Dacarbazin, as well as 250 or 750 microgram palonosetron were compared to patients who received 32 mg of ondansetron given intravenously on day 1.</seg>
<seg id="2632">Results of the studies with medically emetogenic chemotherapy and the study of strongly emetogenic chemotherapy are summarized in the following tables.</seg>
<seg id="2633">In clinical studies for the indication of chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV), the effects of palonosetron on blood pressure, heart rate and ECG parameters including the Qtc interval were comparable with the corresponding effects of ondansetron and dolasetron.</seg>
<seg id="2634">After the findings of pre-clinical investigations, Palonosetron has the ability to block the ion channels involved in ventricular de- and replicarisation and extend the duration of the action potential.</seg>
<seg id="2635">The aim of the study carried out in 221 healthy volunteers was the assessment of the ECG effects of intravenous palonosetron in single doses of 0.25, 0.75 and 2.25 mg.</seg>
<seg id="2636">Resorption After IV administration follows an initial decrease of the plasma concentrations a slow elimination from the body with an average terminale half-time of approximately 40 hours.</seg>
<seg id="2637">The average maximum plasma concentration (Cmax) and the surface under the concentration-time curve (AUC0- ∞) are generally dose-proportional in the entire dose area of 0.3- 90 μ / kg in healthy and cancer patients.</seg>
<seg id="2638">After intravenous administration of palonosetron 0.25 mg every second day for a total of 3 doses, the mean (± SD) increase in palonosetron plasma concentration was 42 ± 34% between day 1 and day 5.</seg>
<seg id="2639">Pharmacokinetic simulations indicate that once daily intravenous administration of 0.25 mg palonosetron was comparable to 3 consecutive days, total textilisation (AUC0- ∞) was comparable with the measured value measured after one-time intravenous administration of 0.75 mg; however, the Cmax was higher after the disposable of 0.75 mg.</seg>
<seg id="2640">About 40% are eliminated by the kidneys and approximately 50% are converted into two primary metabolites, which in comparison to Palonosetron have less than 1% of the antagonistic effect on the 5HT3 receptor.</seg>
<seg id="2641">In vitro studies for metabolism have shown that CYP2D6 and, to a lesser extent, the isoenzyme CYP3A4 and CYP1A2 involved in the metabolism of palonosetron.</seg>
<seg id="2642">Elimination of an intravenous single dose of 10 micrograms / kg [14C] -Palonosetron were found approximately 80% of the dose within 144 hours in the urine, Palonosetron as unmodified ingredient made about 40% of the given dose.</seg>
<seg id="2643">After one-time intravenous bolt injection on healthy subjects, the total body was 173 ± 73 ml / min and the renal clearing 53 ± 29 ml / min.</seg>
<seg id="2644">Although patients with severe liver dysfunctions increase the terminal Elimination period and the average systemic exposure to palonosetron, a reduction in the dose is not justified.</seg>
<seg id="2645">In pre-clinical studies, effects were observed only by exposures that are considered sufficient above the maximum humanistic exposure, which suggests a low relevance for clinical use.</seg>
<seg id="2646">10 From preclinical studies, there were indications that Palonosetron can only block ion channels in very high concentrations, which are involved in ventricular degeneration and replicarisation and can prolong the period of action.</seg>
<seg id="2647">High doses of palonosetron (each dose corresponded to approximately 30 times the therapeutic exposure in humans), which were given daily over two years, resulted in increased frequency of liver tumours, endocrine neoplasma (in thyroid, pituitary, pancreas, adrenal marks) and skin tumours in rats, but not in mice.</seg>
<seg id="2648">The underlying mechanisms are not fully known, but due to the high dosages used and since Aloxi is determined by humans for unique application, the relevance of these results is low as for humans.</seg>

<seg id="2660">In June 2006, the Committee for Medicinal Products for Medicinal Products (CHMP) adopted a negative report recommended by the allocation of approval for the market for the treatment of hepatitis C drug Alpheon 6 million IE / ml injection solution.</seg>
<seg id="2661">This means that Alpheon should resemble a biological medicine called Roferon-A with the same medicinal ingredient that is already approved in the EU (also called "reference drug").</seg>
<seg id="2662">Alpheon should be used to treat adult patients with chronic (long-lasting) hepatitis C (a liver disease caused by a viral infection).</seg>
<seg id="2663">In a microscopic examination, the liver tissue has damage, and the values of the liver enzyme Alanine Aminotransferase (ALT) in the blood are increased.</seg>
<seg id="2664">It is produced by a yeast in which a gene (DNA) was introduced to stimulate the formation of the active substance.</seg>
<seg id="2665">Alpheon produced data that demonstrates the comparison of Alpheon with Roferon-A (drug structure, composition and purity of the drug, mode of action, safety and efficacy in hepatitis C).</seg>
<seg id="2666">In the study of hepatitis C patients, the efficacy of alphonic was compared to 455 patients with the efficacy of the reference resin.</seg>
<seg id="2667">In the study, it was measured how many patients reported after 12 of a total of 48 treatment weeks and 6 months after the treatment was set on the drug (i.e. no sign of virus in the blood reported).</seg>
<seg id="2668">(44-20) 74 18 84 00 Fax (44-20) 74 18 84 16 E-mail: mail @ emea.eu.int http: / / www.emea.eu.int © EMEA 2006 Reproduction and / or distribution of this document is Authorised for non-commercial purposes only provided the EMEA is acknowledged.</seg>
<seg id="2669">In addition, concerns have been expressed that data on the stability of the drug and the drug to be marketed cannot be sufficient.</seg>
<seg id="2670">The number of hepatitis C patients who responded to the treatment with Alpheon and Roferon-A was similar in the clinical trial.</seg>
<seg id="2671">After the treatment with Alpheon the disease appeared again in more patients than with the reference medicinal product; moreover, Alpheon has more side effects.</seg>
<seg id="2672">Apart from this, the test used in the study was not sufficiently validated to investigate the extent to which the medicine forms an immune response (i.e. the body forms antibodies - special proteins - against the drug).</seg>
<seg id="2673">It can be used for the treatment of Impetigo (a skin infection associated with crust formation) and small infected infirs (crack or cut wounds), abrasions and sewed wounds.</seg>
<seg id="2674">Altargo is not to be used to treat infections that have been proven or presumably caused by methicillinresistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) because alarms may not work against this type of infection.</seg>
<seg id="2675">Altargo can be used in patients from the age of nine months, but in patients under 18 years, the area to be treated may not exceed 2% of the body surface.</seg>
<seg id="2676">If the patient does not respond to the treatment after two or three days, the doctor should examine the patient again and consider alternative treatments.</seg>
<seg id="2677">It works by blocking the bacterial ribosomes (the parts of the bacterial cell where proteins are produced) and thereby inhibits the growth of bacteria.</seg>
<seg id="2678">The main indicator of efficacy was in all five studies the proportion of patients whose infection was clung after the end of the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2679">119 (85.6%) of 139 patients under Altargo and 37 (52.1%) of 71 patients under placebo responded to treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2680">In the treatment of infected skin wounds, Altargo and Cefalexin showed similar response rates: if the results of both studies were taken together at home wounds, about 90% of patients of both groups responded to treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2681">In these two studies, however, it was found that Altargo was not effective enough in the treatment of abscesses (stained-filled cavities in the body tissue) or infections that have been proven or presumably caused by MRSA.</seg>
<seg id="2682">The most common side effect with Altargo (which was observed from 1 to 10 of 100 patients) is a irritation at the surfacing point.</seg>
<seg id="2683">The Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) concluded that the benefits of Altargo during short-term treatment of the following superficial skin infections prevailed against the risks: • Impetigo, • infected small infirs, abrasions or sewn wounds.</seg>
<seg id="2684">In May 2007, the European Commission issued a licence for the company Glaxo Group Ltd. for the placing on the market of Altargo throughout the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2685">Patients with no improvement within two to three days should be examined again and an alternative therapy should be considered (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2686">In the event of a sensibilisation or severe local irritation by the use of Retapamulin Salbe the treatment should be stopped, the ointment carefully wiped out and an appropriate alternative therapy of the infection is started.</seg>
<seg id="2687">Retapamulin should not be used for the treatment of infections in which MRSA is known or suspected (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2688">In clinical studies with secondary infected open wounds, the efficacy of Retapamulin was insufficient in patients with infections caused by a methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA).</seg>
<seg id="2689">Alternative therapy should be taken into account if no improvement or deterioration of the infected area occurs after 2 to 3-day treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2690">The effect of simultaneous use of Retapamulin and other topical remedies on the same skin surface has not been examined and the simultaneous use of other topical drugs is not recommended.</seg>
<seg id="2691">Due to the low plasma concentrations that were achieved in humans after topical application on skewed skin or infected superficial wounds, clinically relevant inhibition in vivo is not expected (see Section 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="2692">3 After simultaneous oral administration of 2 times daily 200 mg of ketoconazole, the mean Retapamulin AUC (0-24) and Cmax according to topical application of 1% Retapaminal Salbe on deported skin of healthy adult men increased by 81%.</seg>
<seg id="2693">Due to the low systemic exposure to topical application in patients, dose adjustments are not required when topical Retapamulin is applied during systemic treatment with CYP3A4 inhibitors.</seg>
<seg id="2694">Animal studies have shown a reproductive toxicity after oral ingestion and are inadequate in relation to a statement of effects on the birth and the fetal / postnatal development (see section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2695">Retinotamulin Salbe should only be used during pregnancy if topical antibacterial therapy is clearly indicated and the application of Retapamulin is preferable to a systemic antibiotic.</seg>
<seg id="2696">When deciding whether breastfeeding continues / stops or the therapy should be continued with Altargo, it is necessary to weigh between the benefits of breastfeeding for the baby and the benefit of the Altargo therapy for woman.</seg>
<seg id="2697">In clinical studies of 2150 patients with superficial skin infections, which were used by Altargo, the most common reported side effect of irritation at the date of delivery was about 1% of the patients.</seg>
<seg id="2698">Mode of action Retapamulin is a semi-synthetic derivative of leuromutilin, a substance that is isolated by fermentation from Clitopilus passedanus (formerly pleurotus passedanus).</seg>
<seg id="2699">The mechanism of action of Retapamulin is based on selective inhibition of bacterial protein synthesis by interacting on a specific binding site of the 50s subunit of bacterial ribosoms, which differs from the binding sites of other ribosomal interacting anti-bacterial substances.</seg>
<seg id="2700">Data indicates that the binding site of ribosomale protein L3 is involved in the region of the ribosomal P engagement site and the peptidyltransferase centre.</seg>
<seg id="2701">Binding to this binding site inhibits peanromutiline the peptide transfer, block partial P-binding adjustment interactions and prevent normal formation of active 50s ribosomal subunits.</seg>
<seg id="2702">If, due to the local prevalence of resistance, the application of retinapamulin at least some types of infection appears questionable, consultation by experts should be sought.</seg>
<seg id="2703">There were no differences in the In-vitro activity of retinosamulin compared to S.aureus, regardless of whether the isolates were sensitive or resistant to methicillin.</seg>
<seg id="2704">In the event of non-appeal to the treatment of S.aureus, the presence of strains with additional virulence factors (such as PVL = Panton-Valentine Leucocidin) should be considered.</seg>
<seg id="2705">Resorption In a study with healthy adults, 1% Retapamulin Salbe was applied daily under occlusion on intact and scaled skin for up to 7 days.</seg>
<seg id="2706">Of 516 patients (adults and children) who received 1% Retapamulin Salbe twice daily for 5 days for topical treatment of secondary infected traumatic wounds, individual plasma samples were obtained.</seg>
<seg id="2707">The sampling was performed on days 3 or 4 in the adult patients before medication and in children between 0-12 hours after the last application.</seg>
<seg id="2708">However, the maximum individual systemic exposure to humans after topical application of 1% ointment to 200 cm2 shredded skin (Cmax = 22 ng / ml; AUC (0-24) = 238 ng · h / ml) was 660 times lower than the Retapamulin IC50 for PGP inhibition.</seg>
<seg id="2709">Metabolism The in vitro oxidative metabolism of retinosamulin in human liver microsomites was primarily mediated by CYP3A4, with low participation of CYP2C8 and CYP2D6 (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2710">In studies on oral toxicity of rats (50, 150 or 450 mg / kg) carried out over 14 days, there were signs of adaptive liver and thyroid changes.</seg>
<seg id="2711">In-vitro investigation of gene mutation and / or chromosomal effects in the mouse lymphoma test resp. in cultures of human peripheral blood lymphocytes as well as in the rats-microkernel test for in vivo examination of chromosomal effects.</seg>
<seg id="2712">There was neither male nor female rats any signs of reduced fertility in oral dosing of 50, 150 or 450 mg / kg / day, whereby one to 5 times higher exposure was achieved than the highest estimated exposure to humans (topical application on 200 cm2 grinded skin:</seg>
<seg id="2713">In an embryotoxicity study on rats, oral dosages of ≥ 150 mg / kg / day (corresponding to the ≥ 3-fold of the estimated human exposure (see above), development toxicity (decreased body weight of the fetus and delayed oscillation) and maternal toxicity were detected.</seg>
<seg id="2714">The holder of approval for placing on the market must ensure that a pharmacovigilance system, as presented in Module 1.8.1 of the Admission Application (Version 6.2), works before the product is marketed and as long as the marketed product is applied.</seg>
<seg id="2715">The holder of approval for placing on the market commits to carry out detailed studies and additional pharmacovigilance activities in the pharmacovigilance plan, as described in Version 1 of the Risk Management Plan (RMP) and all additional updates of the RMP agreed with the CHMP.</seg>
<seg id="2716">As described in the CHMP "Guideline on Risk Management Systems for medicinal products for human use," the updated channel is to be submitted simultaneously with the next Periodic Safety Update Report.</seg>
<seg id="2717">Irritation or other signs and symptoms at the treated area indicate that you should quit the application of Altargo and talk to your doctor.</seg>
<seg id="2718">Do not apply any other ointments, creams or lotions on the surface treated with Altargo unless specifically prescribed by your doctor.</seg>
<seg id="2719">It must not be used in the eyes, in the mouth or on the lips, in the nose or in the female genital area.</seg>
<seg id="2720">If the ointment disappears from sight on one of these areas, wash the spot with water and ask your doctor for advice if any ailments occur.</seg>
<seg id="2721">After applying the ointment, you can cover the affected area with a sterile bandage or a gazebo, unless your doctor has advised you not to cover the area.</seg>

<seg id="2723">Ambirix is used to protect hepatitis A and hepatitis B (diseases affecting the liver) in children aged between one and 15 years, who are not immune to these two diseases.</seg>
<seg id="2724">Ambirix is being used as part of a two doses existing vaccination plan, whereby a protection against hepatitis B may only be reached after the second dose is administered.</seg>
<seg id="2725">Therefore, Ambirix may only be used if there is a low risk of hepatitis B infection during the immunization process and it is ensured that the vaccination plan existing from two doses can end.</seg>
<seg id="2726">If a refresher dose is requested against hepatitis A or B, Ambirix or another hepatitis A or B vaccine may be given.</seg>
<seg id="2727">Vaccines work by helping the immune system (the body's natural defense), as it can defend itself against a disease.</seg>
<seg id="2728">After a child has received the vaccine, the immune system recognises the viruses and surface antigens as "foreign" and produces antibodies against it.</seg>
<seg id="2729">Ambirix contains the same constituents as the first-registered Vaccine Twinrix adult and the vaccines admitted since 1997 with Twinrix children since 1997.</seg>
<seg id="2730">The three vaccines are used to protect against the same diseases, but Twinrix adults and Twinrix are administered as part of a three dosages vaccination plan.</seg>
<seg id="2731">Because Ambirix and Twinrix contain adults identical ingredients, some of the data that supports the application of Twinrix adults were also used as evidence of the application of Ambirix.</seg>
<seg id="2732">The main indicator of efficacy was the proportion of vaccinated children who had developed a protective antibody concentration one month after the last injection.</seg>
<seg id="2733">In an additional study involving 208 children, the efficacy of the vaccine was compared with a six-month and a 12 month distance between the two injections.</seg>
<seg id="2734">Ambirix rates between 98 and 100% of vaccinated children one month after the last injection for the development of protective antibody concentrations against hepatitis A and B.</seg>
<seg id="2735">The additional study showed that the degree of protection of Ambirix in a 6-month interval between the injections was similar.</seg>
<seg id="2736">The most common side effects of Ambirix (observed with more than 1 out of 10 vaccine doses) are headache, lack of appetite, pain at the injection site, redness, maternity (fatigue) as well as irritability.</seg>
<seg id="2737">Ambirix may not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to the active ingredients, one of the other components or neomycin (an antibiotic).</seg>
<seg id="2738">In August 2002, the European Commission issued GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals for the company GlaxoSmithKline.</seg>
<seg id="2739">The standardization plan for priming with Ambirix consists of two doses, the first dose at the date of choice and the second dose ranges between six and twelve months after the first dose.</seg>
<seg id="2740">If a booster shot is desired both for hepatitis A and hepatitis B, vaccines can be vaccinated with the appropriate monovalent vaccines or with a combination vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="2741">The anti-hepatitis B-antigen (anti-HBsAg) and anti-hepatitis A virus (anti-HBsAg) and anti-hepatitis A virus (anti-HAV) antibodies are in the same magnitude as after vaccination with the respective monovalent vaccines.</seg>
<seg id="2742">It is not yet fully assured whether immunocompetent persons who have addressed a hepatitis A vaccination need a booster as protection, as they may also be protected by immunological memory even in non-detectable antibodies.</seg>
<seg id="2743">3 As with all injection vaccines, an anaphylactic reaction after the application of the vaccine should always be immediately available for medical treatment and monitoring.</seg>
<seg id="2744">If a rapid protection against hepatitis B is required, the combination vaccine is recommended, containing 360 ELISA units of formalinactivated hepatitis A virus and 10 µg recombinant hepatitis B surface antigen.</seg>
<seg id="2745">In hemodialysis patients and persons with disorders of the immune system, there may be no sufficient anti-HAV- and anti-HBs antibody value after priming, so that further doses may be required in these cases.</seg>
<seg id="2746">Since intramuscular injection or intramuscular administration in the gluteal muscle could lead to an optimal impeller success, these injection routes should be avoided.</seg>
<seg id="2747">In the case of thrombocytopenia or blood clotting disorders, Ambirix can be injected subcutaneously, as it can result in bleeding in these cases after intramuscular administration.</seg>
<seg id="2748">If Ambirix was given in the form of a separate injection at the same time with a combined diphtheria, tetanus, acellular pertussi, inactivated poliomyelitis and haemophilus influenzae type b vaccine (DTPA-IPV / HIB) or with a combined mumps mumps-rubella vaccine, the immune response to all antigens was sufficient (see Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2749">In patients suffering from immunosuppressive therapy or in patients with immune defects, it has to be assumed that there may be no adequate immune response.</seg>
<seg id="2750">In a clinical study conducted with 3 doses of this formulation in adults, the frequency of pain, redness, swelling, matedness, gastroenteritis, headache and fever, comparable to the frequency observed in earlier thiers and preservative-containing vaccine formulation.</seg>
<seg id="2751">In clinical trials 2029 doses of Ambirix were administered to a total of 1027 vaccines at the age of 1 to 15 years.</seg>
<seg id="2752">In a study involving 300 participants aged 12 to 15 years, the tolerance of Ambirix was compared with the 3-dose-combination vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="2753">Only exceptions were the higher frequencies of pain and difference based on a calculation basis per Vaccdose Ambirix, but not based on a calculation basis per person.</seg>
<seg id="2754">Pain was observed after the administration of Ambirix in 50,7% of the subjects compared to 39.1% in subjects after the addition of a dose of 3 doses of combination vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="2755">According to the complete vaccination cycle, 66.4% of the subjects who had given Ambirix had reported pain, compared to 63.8% in the subjects who had been vaccinated using the 3-dose combination vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="2756">The frequency of Maternity was, however, comparable high per proband (i.e. about the entire vaccination cycle at 39.6% of the subjects who received Ambirix in comparison to 36.2% in subjects receiving the 3-dose combination vaccine).</seg>
<seg id="2757">The frequency of severe pain and maternity was low and comparable to those observed after the combination vaccine was administered with the 3 doses vaccination scheme.</seg>
<seg id="2758">In a comparative study of 1- to 11-year-old vaccines, the incidence of local reactions and general reactions in the AmbirixGroup was comparable to that observed when administered with the 3-doses combination vaccine with 360 ELISA units of formalinactivated hepatitis A virus and 10 µg of recombinant hepatitis B surface antigen.</seg>
<seg id="2759">In the 6- to 11-year-olds, however, after vaccination with Ambirix a frequent occurrence of pain (at the injection site) per dose, not per proband, was reported.</seg>
<seg id="2760">The proportion of vaccines reported by severe side effects during the 2-doses vaccine with Ambirix or during the 3 doses vaccine with the combination vaccine with 360 ELISA- units of formalinactivated hepatitis B virus and 10 µg recombinant hepatitis B surface antigen was not statistically different.</seg>
<seg id="2761">In clinical trials conducted in vaccines at the age of 1 to 15 years, the anti-HAV serum rates for anti-HAV 99.1% were one month after the first dose and 100% one month after the second dose (i.e. in month 7).</seg>
<seg id="2762">The Seroconversions for anti-HBs were 74.2% one month after the first dose and 100% one month after the second dose (i.e. in month 7).</seg>
<seg id="2763">7 In a comparative study conducted in 12- to including 15-year-olds, 142 two doses of Ambirix and 147 received the standard combination vaccine with three doses.</seg>
<seg id="2764">In the 289 people whose immunogenicity was worthless, the seroprotection rates (SP in the table below) against hepatitis B in the month 2 and 6 after the addition of the 3-dose vaccine were significantly higher than with Ambirix.</seg>
<seg id="2765">The immune responses, which were achieved in a clinical comparative study at 1 to 11-year-old one month after completion of the full inoculation series (i.e. in month 7), are listed in the following table.</seg>
<seg id="2766">In both studies, the inoculations received either a 2-doses vaccination scheme with Ambirix or a 3-doses vaccine with a combination vaccine with 360 ELISA units of formalinactivated hepatitis A virus and 10µg recombinant hepatitis B surface antigen.</seg>
<seg id="2767">For people who were between 12 and 15 years old at the time of priming, the persistence of anti-HAV- and anti-HBs antibodies could be proven for at least 24 months after immunization with Ambirix in the 0-6-month vaccination scheme.</seg>
<seg id="2768">The immune response observed in this study was comparable to those detected after vaccination of 3 doses with a combination vaccine consisting of 360 ELISA units of formalininactivated Hepatitis- A virus and 10 µg recombinant hepatitis B surface antigen in a dose volume of 0.5 ml.</seg>
<seg id="2769">In a clinical study at 12- to including 15-year-olds, it was shown that the persistence of anti-HAVs and anti-HBs antibodies is comparable 24 months after immunization in the 0-6-month vaccination scheme, compared to the 0-12-month vaccination scheme.</seg>
<seg id="2770">If the first dose of Ambirix in the second year of life was administered simultaneously with the booster shot of a combined diphtheria, tetanus, acellular pertussi, inactivated poliomyelitis and 8 haemophilus influenzae vaccine vaccine, the immune response to all antigens was sufficient.</seg>
<seg id="2771">A clinical study conducted with 3 doses of the present formulation in adults showed similar seroprotection and seroconversions as for earlier formulation of the present formulation.</seg>
<seg id="2772">The vaccine is to be examined both before and after the resuspening of any foreign particles and / or physical visible changes.</seg>

<seg id="2786">Instead, it will recommend you / your child 3 injections of a combined Hepatitis B / Hepatitis B vaccine with a reduced content of effective ingredients per Vaccine (360 ELISA units of a formalininactivated hepatitis A virus and 10 micrograms of a recombinant hepatitis B surface finish).</seg>
<seg id="2787">The second vaccine dose of this vaccine with reduced content of effective ingredients is usually given one month after the first dose and is likely to give you a vaccination protection before ending the vaccination series.</seg>
<seg id="2788">Sometimes Ambirix gets infected with people who suffer from severe blood clotting disorders, under the skin and not in the muscle. • If you / your child are weakened due to a disease or treatment in your body or if you / your child undergo a hemodialysis.</seg>
<seg id="2789">Ambirix may be given in these cases, but the immune response of these individuals on vaccination may not be sufficient so that a blood test may be necessary to see how strongly the reaction to vaccination is.</seg>
<seg id="2790">21 Tell your doctor if you / your child is taking other medicines / intake (including those you can get without prescription) or if you / your child has been vaccinated / has been given or immune to immunoglobulins (antibodies) or has been planned in the near future.</seg>
<seg id="2791">However, it may be that in this case the immune response to the vaccine is not sufficient and the person is therefore not protected against one or both hepatitis A and B viruses.</seg>
<seg id="2792">If another vaccine must be given at the same time with Ambirix, it should be vaccinated in separate areas and as many extremities as possible.</seg>
<seg id="2793">If Ambirix is to be administered at the same time or shortly before or after an injection of immunoglobulins, it is likely that the reaction to the vaccine will still be sufficient.</seg>
<seg id="2794">Typically, Ambirix's pregnant or breastfeeding women are not given, unless they are urgently needed to be vaccinated against hepatitis A as well as hepatitis B.</seg>
<seg id="2795">Important information about specific other components of Ambirix Please inform your doctor if you have already shown an allergic reaction to neomycin (antibiotic).</seg>
<seg id="2796">If you miss the agreed date for the second vaccination, talk to your doctor and arrange a new appointment as soon as possible.</seg>
<seg id="2797">♦ A lot of pain (more than 1 case per 10 injected cans): • Pain or discomfort on the spot or redness • Mateness • irritability • Headache • Appetites lack of appetite</seg>
<seg id="2798">♦ frequently (up to 1 case per 10 injected cans): • swelling at the injection site • Fever fever (above 38 ° C) • Condigious diseases • Gastro-intestinal disorders</seg>
<seg id="2799">Further side effects, which were reported days or weeks after vaccination with comparable combination or single vaccines against hepatitis A and hepatitis B (less than 1 case per 10,000 vaccinated cans), are:</seg>
<seg id="2800">These include local limited or extended precipitation, which can be itchy or blistering, swelling of the eye contours and the face, difficult breathing or swallowing, sudden loss of blood pressure and unconsciousness.</seg>
<seg id="2801">Flu-like complaints, including chills, muscle and joint pain seizures, dizziness, missensations such as tingling and "ant-run," multiple sclerosis, disorders of vision, loss of sensation or mobility of some body parts, strong headaches and stiffness of the neck, interruption of normal brain functions</seg>
<seg id="2802">Fainting inflammation of some blood vessels discomfort or illness, loss of appetite, diarrhoea and abdominal pain change liver function tests lymph node swelling elevated inclination to bleeding or to bruises (bruises) caused by drop in the amount of blood platelet.</seg>

<seg id="2804">Ambirix is available in packs of 1 and 10 with or without needles and in packs of 50 without needles.</seg>
<seg id="2805">On the basis of the data that has been known since issuance of the first approval for placing on the market, the CHMP advocated that the benefit-risk ratio for Ambirix remains positive.</seg>
<seg id="2806">However, since Ambirix was only placed in circulation in a Member State (in the Netherlands since May 2003), the available safety data for this medicine is limited due to low patient exposure.</seg>
<seg id="2807">Ammonaps can also be used in patients at the age of over a month with incomplete enzymatic defect or hyperammonia encephalopathy (brain damage due to high ammonia concentrations) in prehistory.</seg>
<seg id="2808">Ammonaps is - split to several individual doses at meals - swallowed, mixed under the food or administered via a gastrostomieslauch (through the abdominal wall into the stomach of the leading tube) or a nasal probe (through the nose into the stomach of the leading hose).</seg>
<seg id="2809">It was not a comparative study because Ammony could not be compared with another treatment or placebo (a placebo, i.e. without active ingredient).</seg>
<seg id="2810">Ammonella can also cause loss of appetite, a abnormal acid content in the blood, depression, irritability, headache, fainting, fluid retention, taste disturbances or taste aversion, stomach pain, vomiting, nausea, constipation, rash, unpleasant body odor or weight gain.</seg>
<seg id="2811">The Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) concluded that ammonia in patients with disorders of the urea cycle effectively prevented high ammonia levels.</seg>
<seg id="2812">Ammontaps were approved under "extraordinary circumstances" because only limited information about this medicine was given due to the rarity of the disease at the time of approval.</seg>
<seg id="2813">The use is indicated in all patients in which a complete enzyme deficiency already manifests itself in newborns (within the first 28 days of life).</seg>
<seg id="2814">In patients with a late-manium form (incomplete enzyme defect which manifests itself after the first month of life), there is an indication of the use if a hyperammonia encephalopathy is present in the anamnesis.</seg>
<seg id="2815">For infants, for children who are unable to swallow tablets or for patients with hiccups, AMMONAPS is also available in granular form.</seg>
<seg id="2816">The daily dose is calculated individually, taking into account protein tolerance and the daily protein intake needed for the patient's growth and development.</seg>
<seg id="2817">According to previous clinical experience, the normal daily dose sodium phenylbutyrate: • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day in children with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9.9 - 13,0 g / m ² / day with children with a body weight of over 20 kg and for adolescents and adults.</seg>
<seg id="2818">The substitution of citrulline or arginine in a dose of 0.17 g / kg / day or 3.8 g / m ² / day is required for patients who suffer from an early-manifacet lack of Carbamylphosphate synthetase or orniethintranscarcanase.</seg>
<seg id="2819">Patients with an argininosuccinatal synthetase deficiency have to obtain arginine in a dosage of 0.4 - 0.7 g / kg / day or 8.8 - 15.4 g / m ² / day.</seg>
<seg id="2820">AMMONAPS tablets may not be given to patients with hiccups because there is a risk of the development of esophagus ulcera when the tablets do not immediately get into the stomach.</seg>
<seg id="2821">Each tablet AMMONAPS contains 62 mg (2,7 mmol) sodium, accordingly 2.5 g (108 mmol) sodium per 20 g sodium phenylbutyrate, which corresponds to the maximum daily dose.</seg>
<seg id="2822">AMMONAPS should therefore be used in patients with congestive heart failure or severe renal insufficiency as well as with sodium retention and odema-associated clinical conditions with caution.</seg>
<seg id="2823">Since the metabolism and excretion of sodium phenylbutyrat occurs over the liver and kidneys, AMMONAPS should only be used with extreme care in patients with liver or kidney failure.</seg>
<seg id="2824">The importance of these results regarding pregnant women is not known; the use of AMMONAPS during pregnancy is therefore contraindicated (see 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="2825">In subcutaneous administration of phenylacetate in young rats at high doses (190 - 474 mg / kg), the neuronal multiplication slowed and increased neurons increased.</seg>
<seg id="2826">There was also a delayed maturation of cerebral synapses and a diminished number of functioning nerve damage in the brain and thus a disability of brain growth.</seg>
<seg id="2827">It could not be determined whether phenylacetate is excreted in humans into breast milk, and for this reason the use of AMMONAPS is contraindicated during lactation period (see 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="2828">In clinical trials with AMMONAPS, 56% of patients had at least one adverse event (AE) and 78% of these undesirable events have been assumed that they were not associated with AMMONAPS.</seg>
<seg id="2829">The frequency is defined as follows: very often (≥ 1 / 10), frequently (≥ 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 10) and occasionally (≥ 1 / 1,000, &lt; 1 / 100).</seg>
<seg id="2830">A probable toxic reaction to AMMONAPS (450 mg / kg / day) was reported by an 18-year old anorectic patient who developed a metabolic encephalopathy associated with lactic acidosis, severe hypokalemia, armytopenia, peripheral neuropathy and pancreatitis.</seg>
<seg id="2831">A case of overdose occured in a 5 month old infant with an inadvertent single dose of 10 g (1370 mg / kg).</seg>
<seg id="2832">These symptoms are associated with the accumulation of phenylacetate, which showed a dose-limiting neurotoxicity during intravenous administration of doses of up to 400 mg / kg / day.</seg>
<seg id="2833">Phenylacetate is a metabolically active compound, which is conjugated by acetylation with glutamine to phenylacetylglutamine, which is excreted through the kidneys.</seg>
<seg id="2834">Phenylacetylglutamine is comparable to urea (both compounds contain 2 nitric atoms); phenylacetylglutamine is therefore suitable as an alternative carrier for the excretion of excess nitrogen.</seg>
<seg id="2835">5 Patients with disturbances of the urea cycle can be assumed that for each gram, sodium phenylbutyrate is produced between 0.12 and 0.15 g of phenylacetylglutamine nitrogen.</seg>
<seg id="2836">It is important that the diagnosis be stopped early and the treatment is started immediately in order to improve the chances of survival and the clinical outcome.</seg>
<seg id="2837">The prognosis of the early-manifest form of the disease with the occurrence of the first symptoms in newborns was almost always infaust, and the disease led to death even in treatment with peritoneal dialysis and essential amino acids or with its nitrogen-free analogues within the first year of life.</seg>
<seg id="2838">By hemodialysis, the exploitation of alternative ways of nitrogen excretion (sodium benzoate, sodium benzoate and sodium phenylacetate), protein-reduced diet and possibly substitution of essential amino acids, it was possible to increase the survival rate of newborns in postpartal (but within the first month of life) to 80%.</seg>
<seg id="2839">In patients whose disease was diagnosed in the course of pregnancy and which were already treated before the first appearance of hyperammonia encephalopathy the survival rate was 100%, but even in these patients it was time with many mental disabilities or other neurological deficits.</seg>
<seg id="2840">In patients with a late-manifacal form of the disease (including female patients with heterozygotic form of the orniethintranscarcanase deficiency), who recovered from hyperammonia encephalopathy and were subsequently treated with sodium phenylbutyrate and a protein-reduced diet, the survival rate was 98%.</seg>
<seg id="2841">Already existing neurological deficits are hardly reversible even in the treatment and in some patients a further deterioration of the neurological condition can occur.</seg>
<seg id="2842">It is known that phenylbutyrat is oxidized to phenylacetate, which is conjugated with glutamine in the liver and kidneys, whereby phenylacetylglutamine is produced.</seg>
<seg id="2843">The concentrations of phenylbutyrate and his metabolites in plasma and urine were determined after the addition of a single dose of 5 g sodium phenylbutyrate in sober healthy adults and in patients with disturbances of the urea cycle, hemoglobin metabolism and with liver cirrhosis as well as repeated gifts of oral doses of up to 20 g / day (non-controlled studies).</seg>
<seg id="2844">Phenylbutyrate and metabolites were also studied in cancer patients with sodium polyphenylbutyrate (up to 2 g / m ²) or phenylacetate.</seg>
<seg id="2845">After an oral single dose of 5 g sodium phenylbutyrat in tablet form, measured plasma concentrations of phenylbutyrat were detected 15 minutes after ingesting.</seg>
<seg id="2846">In the majority of patients with urea-cyclic disorders or hemoglobin opathies, phenylbutyrate (300-650 mg / kg / day up to 20 g / day) was not detectable in the next morning after nightly fasting.</seg>
<seg id="2847">In three of six patients with cirrhosis of the liver, which were repeatedly treated with sodium polyphenylbutyrate (20 g / day orally in three single doses), the mean phenylacetate concentrations were five times higher on the third day than after the first gifts.</seg>
<seg id="2848">Excretion This medication is excreted within 24 hours to about 80 - 100% in the form of the conjugated product Phenylacetylglutamine over the kidneys.</seg>
<seg id="2849">According to Micronucleus test results, sodium phenylbutyrat had no excruciated effects in the rats treated with toxic and non-toxic cans (examination 24 and 48 h after oral dosing of an individual dose of 878 to 2800 mg / kg).</seg>
<seg id="2850">AMMONAPS granulate is taken orally (infants and children who cannot swallow tablets, or patients with hiccups) or via a gastrostomipad or a nasal probe.</seg>
<seg id="2851">According to previous clinical experience, the normal daily dose sodium phenylbutyrate: • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day with newborns, infants and children with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9.9 - 13,0 g / m ² / day with children with a body weight of over 20 kg and for adolescents and adults.</seg>
<seg id="2852">The concentration of ammonia, arginine, essential amino acids (especially branched chain amino acids), carnitine and serum proteins in the plasma should be kept within the normal range.</seg>
<seg id="2853">The substitution of citrulline or arginine in a dose of 0.17 g / kg / day or 3.8 g / m ² / day is required for patients who suffer from an early-manifacet lack of Carbamylphosphate synthetase or orniethintranscarcanase.</seg>
<seg id="2854">AMMONAPS granulate contains 124 mg (5.4 mmol) sodium per gram of sodium phenylbutyrate, equivalent to 2.5 g (108 mmol) sodium per 20 g sodium phenylbutyrate, which corresponds to the maximum daily dose.</seg>
<seg id="2855">If rats were subjected to phenylacetate (active metabolite of phenylbutyrat) before birth, lesions in the pyramids of the cerebral cortex occurred.</seg>
<seg id="2856">A probable toxic reaction to AMMONAPS (450 mg / kg / day) was reported by an 18-year old anorectic patient who developed a metabolic encephalopathy associated with lactic acidosis, severe hypokalemia, armytopenia, peripheral neuropathy and pancreatitis.</seg>
<seg id="2857">Phenylacetylglutamine is comparable to urea (both compounds contain 2 nitric atoms); phenylacetylglutamine is therefore suitable as an alternative carrier for the excretion of surplus</seg>
<seg id="2858">On the basis of studies on the excretion of phenylacetylglutamine in patients with disorders of the urea cycle, it can be assumed that a monolylbutyrate of 0.12 and 0.15 g of phenylacetylglutamine-nitrogen is produced for each gram.</seg>
<seg id="2859">Already existing neurological deficits are hardly reversible in the treatment, and in some patients a further deterioration of the neurological condition can occur.</seg>
<seg id="2860">After an oral single dose of 5 g sodium phenylbutyrat in granular form, measured plasma concentrations of phenylbutyrat were detected 15 minutes after ingesting.</seg>
<seg id="2861">During the duration of the shelf life, the patient can store the finished product once for a period of 3 months at a temperature of not exceeding 25 ° C.</seg>
<seg id="2862">In this procedure, the small measuring spoon contains 0,95 g, the mean measuring spoon 2.9 g and the large measuring spoon 8.6 g sodium phenylbutyrate.</seg>
<seg id="2863">If a patient has to receive the medication via a probe, AMMONAPS can also be dissolved in water before use (the solubility of sodium phenylbutyrate is up to 5 grams in 10 ml of water).</seg>
<seg id="2864">In patients with these rare diseases, certain liver enzymes are missing, so they cannot excrete the nitrogenous waste products which accumulate in the body after consuming proteins.</seg>
<seg id="2865">If you are using laboratory tests, you must tell the doctor that you are taking AMMONAPS, since sodium polyphenylbutyl can influence the results of certain laboratory tests.</seg>
<seg id="2866">If you are taking AMMONAPS with other medicines, please inform your doctor or pharmacist if you are using other medicines or have recently taken it, even if it is not prescription medicine.</seg>
<seg id="2867">During breastfeeding, you may not use AMMONAPS as the medicine may pass into breast milk and harm your baby.</seg>
<seg id="2868">In rare cases confusion, headache, taste disturbances, disturbances of hearing, disorientation, memory disorders and a worsening of existing neurological conditions were observed.</seg>
<seg id="2869">If you notice one of these symptoms, immediately contact your doctor or with the emergency room of your hospital for the purpose of an appropriate treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2870">If you miss the intake of AMMONAPS take the appropriate dose as soon as possible with the next meal.</seg>
<seg id="2871">Changes in the blood pattern (red blood cells, white blood cells, platelets), reduced appetite, depression, irritability, headache, fainting, fluid retention (swelling), taste disturbances, stomach pain, vomiting, nausea, constipation, unpleasant skin smell, rash, kidney function disorders, weight gain and abnormal laboratory values.</seg>
<seg id="2872">Please inform your doctor or pharmacist if any of the side effects listed below may significantly impair you or notice any side effects that are not indicated in this information.</seg>
<seg id="2873">You may not use AMMONAPS after the expiry date specified on the box and the container according to the expiry date specified.</seg>
<seg id="2874">Like AMMONAPS looks and content of the package AMMONAPS tablets are of whitish color and oval form, and they are provided with the embossing "UCY 500."</seg>
<seg id="2875">30 If laboratory tests are carried out with you, you must inform the doctor that you are taking AMMONAPS, since sodium phenylbutyl can influence the results of certain laboratory tests.</seg>
<seg id="2876">If you are taking AMMONAPS with other medicines, please inform your doctor or pharmacist if you are using other medicines or have recently taken it, even if it is not prescription medicine.</seg>
<seg id="2877">You should take AMMONAPS to the same single doses or use a gastric fistula (tube that runs through the abdominal wall directly into the stomach) or a nasal probe (tube that is led through the nose into the stomach).</seg>
<seg id="2878">31 • Take from the container a heaped measuring spoon of granulate. • Strange a straight edge, e.g. a knife back over the upper edge of the knife handle to remove excess granulate. • The amount remaining in the measuring spoon is equivalent to a measuring spoon. • Take the recommended number of measuring spoon granules from the tank.</seg>
<seg id="2879">Angiox is used to treat adult patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS, reduced blood supply to the heart), for example in unstable angina (a form of chest pain with different thickness) or myocardial infarction (heart attack) (an abnormal measurement value in the electrocardiogram or ECG).</seg>
<seg id="2880">If Angiox is used to prevent blood clots in patients who undergo a PCI, a higher dose is administered and the infusion can be continued up to four hours after the procedure.</seg>
<seg id="2881">This can help in patients with angina or heart attack to maintain blood flow to the heart and increase the efficiency of a PCI.</seg>
<seg id="2882">Approximately 14 000 patients participated in the main study on the treatment of ACS, in which the effect of Angiox in general administration or in connection with a glycoprotein IIb / IIIa inhibitor (GPI, another medicine for preventing blood clots) was compared with the conventional combination treatment with Heparin (another anticoagulan) and a GPI.</seg>
<seg id="2883">During the PCI, the patient frequently used a stent (a short tube remaining in the artery to prevent closure), and additionally received other medicines to prevent blood clots such as abciximab and aspirin.</seg>
<seg id="2884">In the treatment of ACS was Angiox - with or without a gift from GPI - in preventing new events (deaths, heart attacks or reascularisation) after 30 days or one year overall as effective as conventional treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2885">In patients undergoing a PCI, Angiox was as effective in terms of all indicators as heparin, except for severe bleeding, in which it was significantly more effective than heparin.</seg>
<seg id="2886">Angiox cannot be used in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to bivourudine, other hirudine or any of the other ingredients.</seg>
<seg id="2887">It may not be used in patients who recently had a bleeding, as well as in people with high blood pressure or severe kidney problems or heart infection.</seg>
<seg id="2888">The Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) concluded that Angiox is an acceptable replacement for Heparin during the treatment of ACS and during a PCI.</seg>
<seg id="2889">In September 2004, the European Commission issued a permit to the company The Medicines Company UK Ltd for the placing of Angiox in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2890">For the treatment of adult patients with acute coronary syndrome (unstable angina / non-ST-stroke infarction (IA / NSTEMI)) in case of emergency intervention or early intervention.</seg>
<seg id="2891">The recommended starting dose of Angiox in patients with ACS is an intravenous dosage of 0.1 mg / kg followed by an infusion of 0.25 mg / kg / h.</seg>
<seg id="2892">In the event that a PCI is operated in a further row, an additional bolt of 0.5 mg / kg should be given and the infusion for the duration of the intervention should be increased to 1.75 mg / kg / h.</seg>
<seg id="2893">According to the PCI, the reduced infusion dose of 0.25 mg / kg / h can be resumed for 4 to 12 hours following clinical requirements.</seg>
<seg id="2894">Immediately before the procedure, a penalty of 0.5 mg / kg is to be administered, followed by an infusion of 1.75 mg / kg / h for the duration of the procedure.</seg>
<seg id="2895">The recommended dosage of Angiox in patients with a PCI consists of an initial intravenous dosage of 0.75 mg / kg body weight and a subsequent intravenous intravenous infusion with a dose of 1.75 mg / kg body weight / h at least for the duration of the surgery.</seg>
<seg id="2896">The safety and effectiveness of an all-in-one Bolus gift from Angiox has not been examined and is not recommended even if a short PCI procedure is planned.</seg>
<seg id="2897">If this value (ACT after 5 minutes) is shortened to less than 225 seconds, a second bolt of 0.3 mg / kg / body weight should be carried out.</seg>
<seg id="2898">In order to reduce the occurrence of low ACT values, the reconstituted and diluted medicinal product should be carefully mixed before use and intravenously administered intravenously.</seg>
<seg id="2899">As soon as the ACT value is more than 225 seconds, further monitoring is no longer necessary, provided that the 1.75 mg / kg infusion dose is administered correctly.</seg>
<seg id="2900">In patients with moderate kidney function restriction (GFR 30-59 ml / min), which are subjected to a PCI (whether treated with a bivourudin or not), a lower infusion rate of 1.4 mg / kg / h should be used.</seg>
<seg id="2901">If the ACT value is less than 225 seconds, a second bolt dose of 0.3 mg / kg is to be administered and the ACT 5 minutes after the second wrist dose to be checked again.</seg>
<seg id="2902">In patients with moderate kidney damage included in the phase III- PCI trial (REPLACE-2), which led to approval, the ACT value was 5 minutes after the application of the bivourudin cleus without dose adjustment at an average of 366 ± 89 seconds.</seg>
<seg id="2903">3 In patients with severe kidney damage (GFR &lt; 30 ml / min) and also in dialysis-based patients, Angiox is contraindicated (see section 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="2904">The treatment with Angiox can be initiated 30 minutes after the termination of the intravenous administration of unfractional heparin or 8 hours after completion of subcutaneous administration of low-molecular heparin.</seg>
<seg id="2905">• well-known hypersensitivity to the active agent or any other component or against hirudine • active bleeding or increased bleeding risk due to a disturbance of the hemostasis system and / or irreversible bacterial endocarditis. • severe kidney damage (GFR &lt; 30 ml / min) and for dialysis patients</seg>
<seg id="2906">Patients are carefully monitored during the treatment with regard to symptoms and signs of bleeding, especially if bivourudin is given in combination with another anticoagulan (see Section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2907">Although most of the hemorrhages in the case of PCI patients suffer most of the hemorrhages in arterial points, in patients who undergo a percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), bleeding can generally occur everywhere.</seg>
<seg id="2908">In patients who are taking Warfarin and treated with bivourudin, a monitoring of the INR value (International Normalized Ratio) should be considered to ensure that the value after settling the treatment with bivourudin again reaches the level before treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2909">Based on the knowledge about the mode of action of anticoagulants (heparin, warfarin, thrombolytics or thrombocyte aggregations) it can be assumed that these agents increase the risk of bleeding.</seg>
<seg id="2910">In the combination of bivouruines with thrombocyte aggregations or anticoagulants, the clinical and biological hemostasis parameters can be monitored regularly.</seg>
<seg id="2911">Animal experiments are insufficient in relation to pregnancy, embryonic / fetal development, childbirth or postnatal development (see section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2912">4612 were randomised to bivourudin alone, 4604 were randomised to bivourudin plus GPIIb / IIIa inhibitor and 4603 were randomized to either unquestioning heparin or Enoxaparin plus GPIIb / IIIa inhibitor.</seg>
<seg id="2913">Both in the bivourudin group as well as in comparison groups treated with heparin, women and patients over 65 years of age were more common in adverse events than in male or younger patients.</seg>
<seg id="2914">Severe bleedings were defined according to ACUITY and Timi standards for severe bleedings as in table 2 footnotes.</seg>
<seg id="2915">Both light and heavy bleedings were significantly less frequent under bivourudin than in groups with heparin plus GPIIb / IIIa inhibitor and bivoudrudin plus GPIIb / IIIa inhibitor (see table 2).</seg>
<seg id="2916">ACUITY heavy bleeding was defined as one of the following events: intracranial, retroperitoneal, intraocular bleeding or bleeding in the puncture area, haematoma with a diameter ≥ 5 cm at the puncture point, reduction of haemoglobin mirror of ≥ 3 g / dl with known bleeding centre, reoperation due to bleeding, application of blood products to transfusion.</seg>
<seg id="2917">Further, less frequently observed bleeding-localizations occurring in more than 0.1% (occasionally) were "other" punctuation points, retroperitoneal, gastrointestinal, ear, nose or neck.</seg>
<seg id="2918">The following information about side effects are based on the data of a clinical study with bivourudin in 6000 patients undergoing a PCI.</seg>
<seg id="2919">Both in the Bivaliant group as well as in comparison groups treated with heparin, women and patients over 65 years of age were more common in adverse events than in male or younger patients.</seg>
<seg id="2920">Both light and heavy bleedings were significantly less frequent under bivourudin than in the comparison group under Heparin plus GPIIb / IIIa inhibitor.</seg>
<seg id="2921">The following side effects, which are not listed above, were reported in practice after a comprehensive application and are grouped according to system organclasses in table 6.</seg>
<seg id="2922">In case of overdosage, the treatment with bivourudin is immediately broken off and the patient is closely meshed with regard to signs of bleeding.</seg>
<seg id="2923">Angiox contains bivourudin, a direct and specific thrombone inhibitor, which binds both the catalytic center and the animal bone region of thromboin, regardless of whether thrombosis is bound in the liquid phase or clots.</seg>
<seg id="2924">Binding of bivourudin to thromboin, and thus its effect, is reversible, because thromboin is slowly splitting the bond of bivourudin-ARG3-Pro4, which regenerates the function of the active center of thrombine.</seg>
<seg id="2925">Furthermore, a bivourudin with serum from patients in which it had occurred in the past to heparin-induced thrombocytopenia / heparininduced thrombocytopenia / heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT / HITTs) did not induce a thrombocyte formation reaction.</seg>
<seg id="2926">In healthy volunteers and in patients, bivourudin shows a dose and concentration-dependent anti-coagulatory effect, which is substantiated by the extension of ACT, aPTT, PT, INR and TT.</seg>
<seg id="2927">If a PCI was performed in the following patients, an additional bolt of 0.5mg / kg of bivourudin should be given and the infusion for the duration of the intervention should be increased to 1.75mg / kg / h.</seg>
<seg id="2928">In the Arm A of the ACUITY study, unfractionated heparin or enoxaparin was administered in accordance with the relevant guidelines for the treatment of acute coronary syndrome (ACS) in patients with unstable angina / non-ST-lift attack (IA / NSTEMI).</seg>
<seg id="2929">Patients in Arm A and B were also randomized to obtain a GPIIb / IIIa inhibitor either before beginning of angiography (at the time of randomisation) or in the PCI.</seg>

<seg id="2965">Apidra is used for the treatment of adults, adolescents and children from six years with diabetes, which require treatment with insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2966">Apidra is injected subcutaneous (under the skin) into the abdominal wall, the thighs or upper arm, or administered as a permanent infusion with an insulin pump.</seg>
<seg id="2967">Diabetes is a disease in which the body does not produce enough insulin to regulate glucose levels (sugar) in the blood or the insulin cannot be processed effectively.</seg>
<seg id="2968">Insulin lulisin differs very marginally from human insulin, and the change means it acts faster and has a shorter duration than a short-acting humanoid.</seg>
<seg id="2969">Apidra has been studied in combination with a long-acting insulin for patients with type 1 diabetes, in which the body can produce no insulin, in two studies with a total of 1,549 adults and in a study with 572 children aged between four and 17 years.</seg>
<seg id="2970">In the case of type 2 diabetes, in which the body is unable to work effectively, Apidra was studied in a study of 878 adults.</seg>
<seg id="2971">The main indicator of efficacy was the change in the concentration of the substance glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) in the blood that indicates how well the blood sugar is set.</seg>
<seg id="2972">In the first study involving adults with type 1 diabetes, a reduction of 0.14% (from 7.60% to 7.46%) compared to a reduction of 0.14% in insulin lisper was observed after six months.</seg>
<seg id="2973">In adults with type 2 diabetes, the reduction of HbA1c concentration was 0.46% after six months with Apidra compared to 0.30% in human normal insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2974">Apidra may not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to insulin lulisin or any of the other ingredients, or in patients who are already suffering from hypoglycemia.</seg>
<seg id="2975">The doses of Apidra may need to be adapted if it is administered together with a number of other medicines that can affect the blood glucose level.</seg>
<seg id="2976">In September 2004, the European Commission issued a permit to the company Sanofi-Aventis Deutschland GmbH for the placing on the market of Apidra in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2977">Apidra can be applied as subcutaneous injection either in the area of the abdominal wall, the thigh or the delta muscle or subcutaneous through continuous infusion in the area of the abdominal wall.</seg>
<seg id="2978">Because of the reduced glucose availability and reduced insulin metabolism, insulin requirements in patients with a reduction in liver function can be reduced.</seg>
<seg id="2979">Any change in the effective strength, the brand (her-), insulin type (normal, NPH, zinc retarded, etc.), the type of insulin (animal insulin) and / or the manufacturing method can change the insulin requirement.</seg>
<seg id="2980">3 An insufficient dosage or abortion of treatment, especially in patients with insulin-related diabetes, may lead to hyperglycemia and diabetic ketoacidosis; these conditions are potentially life-threatening.</seg>
<seg id="2981">The conversion of a patient to another type of insulin or an insulin produced by another manufacturer should be carried out under strict medical supervision and may necessitate a change in dosage.</seg>
<seg id="2982">The time of occurrence of hypoglycemia depends on the action profile of the insulin used and can therefore change when changing the treatment scheme.</seg>
<seg id="2983">Substances that increase blood sugar-lowering activity and increase the tendency to hypoglycemias include oral antidiabetic, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, dispopyramid, fibrate, fluoxetine, pentoxifylline, propoxyphene, salicylates and sulfonamide antibiotics.</seg>
<seg id="2984">In addition, under the effect of sympatholytics such as beta blockers, clonidin, Guanethidine and reserpine, the symptoms of adrenergic counterregulation can be attenuated or absent.</seg>
<seg id="2985">Experimental studies on reproductive toxicity showed no differences between insu- linglulisin and human insulin in relation to pregnancy, embryonic / fetal development, birth or postnatal development (see section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2986">It is not known whether insulin lulisin occurs in human breast milk, but generally insulin does not enter into breast milk, nor is it resorbed after oral application.</seg>
<seg id="2987">The following are listed in clinical trials known for adverse drug reactions, grouped according to system organ classes and sorted according to decreasing frequency of occurrence (very common: ≥ 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 100; rare: ≥ 1 / 10,000, &lt; 1 / 1000; very rare: &lt; 1 / 10,000); not known (frequency based on available data cannot be estimated).</seg>
<seg id="2988">Cold welding, cool and pale skin, fatigue, nervousness or tremor, anxiety, unusual creation or weakness, confusion, lack of concentration, dizziness, excessive dog, changes in vision, headaches, nausea and palpitations.</seg>
<seg id="2989">Lipodystrophy is missed to continuously change the injection site within the injection area, can result in a lipodystrophy at the injection site.</seg>
<seg id="2990">Severe hypoglycemias with unconsciousness can be treated by means of an intramuscular or subcutaneous injection of glucose (0.5 to 1 mg) given by an appropriately trained person, or by intravenous glucose by a doctor.</seg>
<seg id="2991">After glueing, the patient should be monitored in a hospital to determine the primary cause of severe hypoglycemia and avoid similar episodes.</seg>
<seg id="2992">Insulin reduces blood sugar levels by stimulating peripheral glucose intake (especially through skeletal muscles and fat) as well as by inhibiting glucose production in the liver.</seg>
<seg id="2993">Studies with healthy volunteers and patients with diabetes have shown that in the case of subcutaneous GA- of insulin lulisines the effect occurs more quickly and the duration of time is shorter than with a normal insulin analog.</seg>
<seg id="2994">In a study of 18 male people aged 21 to 50 years with type 1 diabetes mli- tus, insulin lulisin showed a dose of proportional glucosesentative effect in the therapeutic relevant dosage range of 0,075 to 0.15 E / kg, and at 0.3 E / kg or more a disproportionate increase in the glucosesthetic effect, just like the human insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2995">Insulin lulisin has a twice as fast response as normal human insulin and achieves the complete glucosesentative effect about 2 hours earlier than human insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2996">From the data it was obvious that in an application of insulin lulisin 2 minutes before the meal, a comparable post-fladenal glycaemic control is reached as with a human normal insulin which is given 30 minutes before the meal.</seg>
<seg id="2997">If insulin lulissis was taken 2 minutes before the meal, a better postdenial control was achieved than with a human normal insulin which was given 2 minutes before the meal.</seg>
<seg id="2998">If insulin luliseed is applied in 15 minutes after the start of the meal, a comparable glycaemic control is achieved as with a human regulator that is given 2 miths before the meal (see Figure 1).</seg>
<seg id="2999">Insulin lulisin for gift 2 minutes (GLULISIN - previously) before the start of the meal was given before the start of the meal (Figure 1A) as well as compared to human normal insulin which was given 2 minutes (NORMAL - before) before a meal (Figure 1B).</seg>
<seg id="3000">Insulin lulisin for 15 minutes (GLULISIN - afterwards) after the start of the meal compared to human nor- malaria, which was given 2 minutes (NORMAL - before) before the start of the meal (Figure 1C).</seg>
