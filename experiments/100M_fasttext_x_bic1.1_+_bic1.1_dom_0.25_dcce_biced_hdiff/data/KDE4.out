the module website can be translated in the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; menu under Extras website . select the source and target language of the translation from the drop @-@ down list .
if a part of the text is selected , only this part will be translated into place of the entire &amp; URL ;
machine translations are only very ru@@ di@@ ment@@ ary . in the best case Bab@@ el@@ fish produces a rough translation and in the worst case non@@ sense . therefore , the translations should not make any important decisions , without checking the translation beforehand .
only websites on the Internet can be translated . other texts should be translated on the Bab@@ el@@ fish page itself , where you can paste text directly .
the package &amp; package ; contains several modules for &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; despite its small size , they offer some additional functions and simplify the use of some features of &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; by making this easier available .
further information on the use of &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; and the built @-@ in functions can be found in the manual on &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; .
to load these modules in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or , choose Settings Exten@@ sions .... Open the card card tools and select the modules you want .
this is a list of standard settings modules from the box , add@@ ons . please note that if you have additional software installed , you may have more modules installed on your system .
you should install the k@@ de@@ base package , the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or , before you compile it .
to use the crash module , click &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; on Extras Fig@@ ures . then you can view the page that has brought down &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; or the list of crashes , if available .
the Module An@@ chor Filter ( also called folder filter ) can be reached in the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; menu bar under Extras In@@ sight filter . with the module you can filter &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; &apos; s current working directory in different ways .
to use the DO@@ M tree view in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or , select Extras DO@@ M tree ... and open a new window with the DO@@ M of the currently displayed website . as default , the display begins with the root node of the document , example : docum@@ ent@@ Element , all other nodes are sub@@ elements of this root node .
the module &amp; FS@@ View ; for &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; provides a further view for objects with the MI@@ ME type in@@ ode / directory for local files . it can be used as an alternative for the various symbol and text views to view the content of your local file system .
the peculi@@ arity of &amp; FS@@ View ; consists of plot@@ ting ne@@ sted hierarch@@ ies with the help of a so @-@ called tree map . tree maps allow the representation of the size of objects in ne@@ sted structures . each object is represented by a rect@@ angle whose surface is proportional to its size .
with &amp; FS@@ View , the size is the size of a file or folder , whereby the size of a folder is defined as the sum of the size of the entries in it . thus , large files can be easily identified , even if they are far below in the folder hierarchy . thus , &amp; FS@@ View may be seen as a graphical and interactive version of the &amp; UNIX Â® -@@ command .
in &amp; FS@@ View ; is an entry in the Tre@@ em@@ ap representation a rect@@ angle representing a file or folder in your fil@@ esystem . for simpler navigation , the rec@@ tan@@ gles possess meaningful coloring and labelling settings .
the color of a rect@@ angle that is switched over view color mode can either be depth for easy detection of the ne@@ sting depth or the illustration of another file property such as name , owner , group or MI@@ ME type .
a rect@@ angle can be labeled with the different properties of the appropriate file or folder . for each property you can specify whether it is displayed at all , only if there is enough space to display , or whether the area of subordin@@ ate rect@@ angle should be used ( whereby , therefore , you can specify the relative position of the let@@ tering in the rect@@ angle .
with display algorithms for Tre@@ em@@ aps , the rule should be comp@@ lied with that the area is proportional to the size of the entry . with the Tre@@ em@@ ap in &amp; FS@@ View , this target is not always comp@@ lied with .
how to split the area of an entry for the subordin@@ ate entries remains to be left to the implementation . in this context , it is always advantageous for the lab@@ eling and avoid@@ ance of space losses in such a way as to create rec@@ tan@@ gles that are as square as possible . the best methods of this are rows , columns or recur@@ sive divisions .
you can define the minim@@ ally displayed area for an entry via the menu entry View View@@ ing With Area . instead , a diamond pattern is drawn into the area of the parent entry to indicate that this area is actually occupied by a subordin@@ ate entry .
originally , &amp; FS@@ View ; designed as a small test application and introduction to the use of the Tre@@ e@@ Map wid@@ gets developed for the application of C@@ ach@@ eg@@ r@@ ind .
the Picture Gallery module can be found in the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; menu under Extras image gallery ... or with C@@ trl ; I .
when you visit the Picture Gallery module , you will open a dialog with which you can define the image of the gallery .
the title of the page allows you to adjust the title of the picture gallery page in a text input field .
the option Pictures per line has a sli@@ der and a script to adjust the number of thumb@@ nails of each row in the gallery .
the File name of the image will show if the file names are displayed in the gallery under the thumb@@ nails .
with the image file size of the image , specify whether the file size is displayed under the thumb@@ nails in the gallery .
with the image size check box , specify whether the size of the images is displayed in the gallery under the thumb@@ nails .
in the Fol@@ der dialog , select where the gallery will be stored and which sub@@ folders are to be included .
in the Save in HTML file , specify where to store the HTML page .
the sub@@ folder can be connected to the sub@@ folder via a sli@@ der or a script , up to which level the sub@@ folders will be included .
you can copy the original pictures with the check box to see if the original images are to be copied to the gallery .
use the comment file to use a comment file for the cap@@ tion of the images in the gallery .
in the check box O@@ wn color depth , you can set a different color depth for the thumb@@ nails than in the original pictures .
the module &amp; HTML ; settings gives you easy access to the general &amp; HTML ; settings for &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; .
the module &amp; HTML ; -@@ Settings can be found in the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; menu under Extras HTML Settings . the following behavior of the web browser can be specified here :
the media playback for the navigation pane can be found in the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; view menu under the navigation pane or with the keyboard short@@ cut F@@ 9 .
to play , click the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or &apos;s navigation area ; and drag the music files you want to hear in the media playback .
change your browser identi@@ fier add a menu entry in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; add to which you can change browser and operating system identi@@ fier for individual domains . this is useful for websites that allow access only with certain browsers .
the default browser detection of the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; is Mozilla / 5.0 ( compatible ; Con@@ quer@@ or / 3.3 ; Linux ) ( K@@ HTML , like G@@ eck@@ o ) . if you come to a web page that refuses to access this browser , change the browser identi@@ fier in one of the following options .
change the password in M@@ SI@@ E for pages which reject the access with browsers on the basis of Mozilla . for example , you need the M@@ SI@@ E browser detection to call with the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; Hot@@ mail .

an easy @-@ to @-@ use camera interface will be made available to you to connect to your digital camera and download your photos directly in &amp; digi@@ p@@ . more than 1000 digital cameras are supported with the g@@ Photo@@ 2 library . of course , each media and card reader supported by your operating system will work with &amp; digi@@ plug ; work together .
&amp; edited ; includes fast image processing with basic image editing tools . you can use them to view , comment , rate and correct your photos . editing capabilities can easily be extended using K@@ DE Image Plug @-@ In Interface ( manual ) modules .
although &amp; edited ; easy to use , it provides dozens of professional capabilities . it works entirely in 16 @-@ bit color space and all available modules support raw conversion via li@@ bra@@ w , D@@ NG export and ICC color management workflow .
improved database with much more metadata , such as &amp; eg ; via the camera or lens that can be searched .
like all &amp; k@@ de ; programs is also &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; an open source project . that means it depends on the support of end users . therefore , you should report problems and improvement possibilities .
&amp; edited ; tries to make the reporting of problems or suggestions as easy as possible for them . wherever you are in the program , the Help menu will open a page in the error report system . if you use these links , your web browser opens a page in the error reporting system . all the information you need is already registered here . just follow the instructions to send your report .
&amp; edited ; is a project supported by a community . that is , the user and developer will help each other . if you are a regular user of &amp; digi@@ kam , then we would like to encourage you to answer questions other users of &amp; digi@@ kam . in this mailing list , however , English is spoken , you should therefore be powerful in this language .
you can also edit the digi@@ code ; visit homepage to learn news about shared versions and other information about &amp; digi@@ kam .
the best start to get started &amp; edited is logging in in the developer mailing list . instructions to login to the developer mailing list of &amp; digi@@ plug ; .
when you start &amp; edit ; for the first time , you &apos;ll be asked where to save your pictures and your database . you can specify a local , remote or removable folder . simply enter the path name or click the folder icon Fol@@ der icon to select a folder .
in the second field you need to specify a local folder on your computer . here the data ab@@ n@@ ad is stored . this path stays the same for all image folders .
later you can add as many folders as you want . &amp; digi@@ plug ; will additionally use as an Al@@ ben@@ bibliothek .
if you already have a picture collection on your hard disk , you can specify the top folder containing pictures as the base folder . no picture will be changed . while browsing the folders you get a progress indicator like this :
&amp; edited ; thir@@ dly recur@@ sively the library path in its entire depth . you cannot exclude sub @-@ folders unless it is in hidden folder . you can do this by adding one point in front of the name of the sub@@ folder .
if you take an existing folder with photos as a base folder , you will notice that the albums in My Al@@ ben@@ liste do not have any photos as symbols . you can change them by taking a photo from the album and taking it on the folder icon .
once you have configured the base folder , you can set up your digital camera . after that , you should learn how to use My Albums and My Sel@@ f@@ lists to manage your photos in the albums .
raw file support : if you use the raw mode of your camera , &amp; digi@@ plug may also handle it . support is based on the li@@ bra@@ w library . if you want to figure out if a specific camera is supported , you will find a list of supported raw cameras in the help shell camera support menu .
how to set up this and work with raw files is described in the sections Ro@@ h @-@ Dec@@ oder@@ setup and Ro@@ h workflow .
an easy @-@ to @-@ use camera interface will be made available to you to connect to your digital camera and download your photos directly in &amp; digi@@ p@@ . more than 1000 digital cameras are supported with the g@@ Photo@@ 2 library . of course , each media and card reader supported by your operating system will work with &amp; digi@@ plug ; work together .
modern digital cameras feature the use of Compact &amp; Flash ; memory cards and USB or Fire@@ Wire ( I@@ EE@@ E @-@ 13@@ 94 or i @-@ Link ) for data transfer . for actual transmission to the computer , the camera is often used as a disk drive . the camera can also be realized via the Picture Transfer Protocol ( P@@ TP ) and its deriv@@ atives .
&amp; digi@@ plug ; uses the g@@ Photo@@ 2 program to communicate with digital camera . g@@ Photo@@ 2 also supports the Picture Transfer Protocol , a widely used protocol developed by the International Imaging Industry Association . it allows the transfer of images from digital cameras to computers and other periph@@ er@@ als without the need for additional drivers .
many old digital cameras use the serial port for their communication with the computer . since photos are generally large files and trans@@ missions via the serial port are slow , this connection is now obsol@@ ete . &amp; digi@@ plug ; supports these cameras and performs the transfer of images with g@@ Photo@@ 2 . a complete list of supported cameras can be found under this link .
lib@@ g@@ Photo@@ 2 has to be created with li@@ be@@ x@@ if support so the thumb@@ nails can be read reliably . if the Ex@@ if support is not present in lib@@ g@@ photo@@ 2 , thumb@@ nails may not be seen or the generation could be very slow .
one of the most beautiful things about digi@@ ti@@ zing is how easy it is to expand its functionality through modules :
K@@ IP@@ I modules : the K@@ DE Image plug@@ ins Interface Project ( manual ) is an approach to develop a common module structure for &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zing ; , K@@ Photo@@ Album , Sho@@ wi@@ mg and G@@ wen@@ view . the aim is to provide the modules to all graphics programs . the settings for the K@@ IP@@ I modules are described in this section .
modules can manipul@@ ate images in virtually any way , as it can also be a user . their advantage is that it is much easier , &amp; edited ; by writing a small module to add a function when the changes in &amp; digi@@ plug ; even carry out .
to simplify the window , you can either remove the side rails with &amp; L@@ MB ; remove or switch to full screen mode with F@@ 11 or C@@ trl + Shift + F .
drag and drop images works everywhere : you can lay an image in another part of the tree , above the horizontal divi@@ der line or in another application window . the only limitation is that one image cannot be stored in keywords , data list or search .
- a file type selection allows you to stand out the most common : JPEG , P@@ NG , TI@@ FF , Ro@@ h , Mo@@ vies and Audio
the text filter will only be used for the fields displayed in the toolbar . thus , filtering on the fil@@ en@@ ame only works if this is shown in the symbol view . which fields are displayed can be configured in the dialog of the Al@@ ben@@ Settings .
the View &amp; quot ; My Al@@ ben@@ li@@ ste@@ eper ; provides an organized view on your photo albums . all photos stored by &amp; digi@@ kam are stored in a single album tree . these albums can be sorted according to the folders in which they were stored on the hard disk , on the name of their collection in the album properties or after the date on which the album was first created . the date can be changed in the properties of the album .
if you have set up a scanner , you can also scan a photo directly into an album . you can also select Album im@@ porting images . you can also add a screen@@ shot to an album directly .
to copy or move a picture from one album to another , you can move the photo with the mouse to the target album and drop it there . in the then appearing menu you must select whether the image is moved by moving or copying . you can also move or copy several photos in the same way . simply select all the photos and move them to the target album .
an album contains a collection of photos and the album properties allow you to enter information about this collection . to access the album features , right click on the album and select album properties in the context menu .
album collections : are a method to mark your albums so that you can be group@@ ed together under a common name . the collection from you is used to sort your photos by selecting or selecting albums from the toolbar . if you want to add or delete new collections , you can do this in the settings for collections .
the album date : is used when you sort your albums by date with View albums by date .
the oldest , average , new test@@ ers : these places the date on the oldest , the newest picture or the average of the album . to do this , first tries to calculate the average of the images from their EX@@ IF information . if this fails , instead , the date of last modification of each file is used in this folder .
if you first have an album in &amp; edited , the first picture in the album will be selected as a symbol for the &amp; quot ; My Al@@ ben@@ li@@ ste@@ quot ; selected . sometimes the first photo on the album is not representative and you might want to select another photo as a symbol .
to select another photo as an album icon , you must click the image with the right mouse button and select it in the context menu &amp; quot ; As album preview w@@ enqu@@ ot ; in addition , you can drag the picture to the album in the list to set it as a symbol .
an album can always be included in a collection and collections cannot be dis@@ car@@ ded .
&amp; edited ; supports the input of key words for individual photos in the section My key@@ wor@@ d@@ list on the bottom of the main window . album collections have a different effect . the collection always includes all photos of the album . you can of course use both methods to organize your photos .
the image window will provide you with the main view of your photos . if you select an album , all images in this album will be displayed in the image window . each photo is displayed in a preview , you can adjust the size of this preview with the two magni@@ fying glass buttons in the toolbar .
if you open an album the first time , you need to wait a little while the thumb@@ nails are generated . you can avoid this by using the Tools menu to recre@@ ate all preview images .
information on each image will be displayed below the corresponding preview . what information is this , you can change the settings digi@@ ti@@ zed ; set up the page and adjust the range of thumb@@ nails to your preferences .
the thumb@@ nails feature help windows that appear . if you leave the mouse poin@@ ter a moment over a picture , the help shows the most important features including all the keywords of a photo . the screen@@ shot at the top of the Intro@@ duction to the main window shows such an help window .
photos are everything from &amp; digi@@ kam . albums and keywords allow you to organize your pictures as it suits you . you can reach all the functions that can be done with &amp; edited . you can reach all the functions that can be edited with &amp; edited . you can choose between viewing the pictures , a slide show or editing the images .
you can open the image editing with a photo by right @-@ clicking either F@@ 4 or Edit ... or selecting the context menu of the image with the right mouse button and editing ... you can find a guide on how to edit your photos . with image editing , you can view your photos and change them .
it can happen that &amp; digi@@ plug ; the functionality you need is not available . you can open a photo in another program by right @-@ clicking the context menu and selecting the program from the sub@@ menu of opening . for this , and how to customize it to your needs if your program is not listed , you will find information in the &amp; k@@ de ; manual .
you should note that after editing by other image processing programs you can get problems with the metadata contained in the image . some programs do not store this data with when you save the changed image . thus , this information is lost from the EX@@ IF and IP@@ TC data , such as orientation , aperture , etc .
&amp; edit ; provides two options for rotation . the easiest way is to click the right mouse button to preview and rotate . in the sub@@ menu you can specify the degree of rotation .
to change the file name of a photo , you can right click on the preview and select F@@ 2 ren@@ ame from the context menu . note that you will retain the extension ( .@@ j@@ pg , .@@ tif , &amp; etc ; ) .
if you delete a photo from &amp; edited , it will be moved to the garbage bin by &amp; k@@ de ; moved . F@@ 8 Picture Del@@ ete or Del@@ ete If you prefer to really delete , you can use this by using Shift + Del .
the View &amp; quot ; My Dat@@ um@@ str@@ ing@@ quot ; organizes your photos based on data . &amp; edited ; use either the EX@@ IF date or , if this is not available , the date of last modification of the file .
if you select a month from the list , all photos of this month will be displayed in the picture view . you can select days or weeks in the date sheet below in the date view so that you will only be shown the photos of the selected days .
photos with keyword provides a flexible and powerful way to organize and catalog your photos . keywords are sti@@ ckers , the individual photos or entire groups can be assigned . once a keyword has been assigned to a photo , the photo can be found by selecting this keyword or a search again .
when a keyword is selected , all photos that have been marked with this keyword will be shown .
keywords can be sorted into a hierarch@@ ical tree . this allows you to organize your keywords lo@@ gically . you can also fold parts of the tree &amp; quot ; My keyword li@@ aison , so that you can easily find the keywords you are looking for .
the keywords are stored in a database for fast access and assigned keyword in the IP@@ TC data fields of the image , at least for JPEG . thus , you can also use your keywords in other programs .
you can add new keywords by right @-@ clicking either on &amp; quot ; My keyword , or click on an existing keyword and then choose Cre@@ ate New keyword . if you have a new keyword after clicking on an existing keyword , this will become the keyword for this keyword .
you can delete a keyword by clicking on the keyword with the right mouse button and selecting Del@@ ete . if you delete a keyword , the photo itself will not be deleted . only the keyword will be removed from this photo .
you can change the position of a keyword by dra@@ gging it to the desired position in the tree and place it there . then a menu appears that gives you the option to post@@ p@@ one . a keyword can be at a time only once in a tree .
you can change the properties of a keyword by clicking on it with the right mouse button and selecting the keyword in the context menu . you can change the name of the keyword and the symbol in the tree &amp; quot ;
to select another photo as an album icon , you must click the picture with the right mouse button and select As an album preview in the context menu . in addition , you can drag the picture to the album in the list to set it as a symbol .
it can be done in two ways : once you have selected the photos you want to provide with a keyword , you can drag them to the keyword in the tree &amp; quot ; My keyword , drag and drop them . alternatively , you can also click the right mouse button to preview the pictures and select keyword names from the context menu .
you can tag a photo with any number of keywords . the photo will be displayed as soon as you select one of the keywords assigned to it . in this way you can give a cue for each person on a photo , one for the place where the photo was taken , one for the event where it was made etc .
once you have completed a photo with keyword , it will be displayed in the main window under the preview of the image .
you can remove a keyword in which you can right click the context menu of the picture and select from the Tags menu Rem@@ ove . the menu will show you only the key words assigned to the photo .
the tim@@ eline view displays a time @-@ dependent hist@@ ogram of the number of images per time unit . a selection box can be moved using this hist@@ ogram . to select a time frame , just click on the bottom rect@@ angle of the selection box that indicates the time unit .
in the field below , you can enter a title and save your selection . it will appear in the list below .
includes all the elements of the database : names , ratings , keywords , keywords , albums , collections , date stamps and more .
next to the search box is a small lamp that will be green when searching hits . if you click here , the filtering will be deleted and all images will be displayed again . if the search did not find anything , then the lamp will be red .
the more advanced search tool is hidden in the tab on the left side bar with the bin@@ o@@ cul@@ ars . if you open this , you get a simple search box as described above . however , you can save this search here as a live search , which always filters what you have entered as a search criteria .
if you are satisfied with your selection , press OK and the search will be done . the results will be displayed in my search list in the main window . if you want to change your selection after searching again , you just need to select the appropriate entry from the View My Search list and select an option in its context menu .
when you select Search Edit , the search appears again with the previously entered search information . if you select As Advanced Search , the Advanced Search dialog appears to change your previous search . more information can be found in the section The Tool for Advanced Search .
if you want to delete an existing search from the list , select Del@@ ete in the context menu search .
the Advanced Search will provide you with an advanced search form with many search parameters that you can search in certain fields of &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zing ; s database .
the list of search rules is used to set the options for a search query in the database . an option can be added to this list with search group / search group will be added or deleted . each option can be combined with others via the logical operations All ... , One ... , No ... or At least ... you can also search for type &amp; quot ; AND NI@@ CH@@ T@@ quot ; .
&amp; digi@@ kam ; character@@ izes each image by a long number with a special technique , the hair algorithm . this allows images to be compared by comparing these signatures . the smaller the difference between two image signatures , the more they correspond . this technique is applied in three areas .
similar entries : this is an area in which you can drop any picture to find a similar one . by using a sw@@ ell@@ erts , the result selection can be enlarged or reduced . if you slide a picture from somewhere over the icon of the unused search in the left side bar , then it will open and you can drop it there .
sket@@ ch : free @-@ hand colour sket@@ ch : draw a quick sket@@ ch and &amp; edited ; find the suitable pictures . also here a threshold value can be set .
this tab provides an intuitive card search tool based on the Mar@@ ble Mini@@ program . you can move in or out with the mouse wheel or hold it and move it . move it while you click the left mouse button . all images within these coordinates are filtered and displayed .
in the field below you can specify a name for your ge@@ o @-@ filter . it will then be added for later use of the list below . it works like a Live Geo@@ Filter .
&amp; edited ; provides a table in a separate window with which you can easily compare pictures . it works with all supported image file formats , including raw files .
select one or more images from any view in the main window and then use C@@ trl ; L The lumin@@ aire is added from the context menu . the selection will be added to the lumin@@ aire and open its window . if you are back in &amp; edit ; main window , you can quickly open the lumin@@ aire with L Extras back@@ side .
from the thumb@@ nail , you can drag and drop the images you want to compare to the left or right part of the window . if you are looking for a preview from the toolbar , select Zoo and move operations on one of the pictures , then they are also executed in the other image . you can therefore compare the same area of the two images .
another mode is better suited to quickly select from a series of images . if you navigate pair mode from the toolbar , then the two first pictures are automatically loaded into the areas for compar@@ isons . use the left mouse button on any preview image to display it on the left . this makes it easy to browse through a series of similar images .
of course the normal dele@@ tion actions also work directly from the light table like e.g. F@@ 4 file Edit ....
all picture information from the main window of the main window is available for both thumb@@ nails in the lumin@@ aire . this makes it easy to link visual differences with exposure data .
in the lower end of each area you will find a built @-@ in p@@ anning function that you can detect on the crossed arrows . in order to swivel the visible area of the image , you need to click them and hold the &amp; L@@ MB ; in the preview mode both images will display the same image area .
the zo@@ oming works as well as in other views . simply use the zoom knob under the images or C@@ trl ; mouse wheel to zoom in and out . this happens in both pictures when you are in the preview mode .
what is a digital inventory management - away from the modem word ? digital inventory management considers every part of the process after the image has been taken up to final output and permanent storage . each of the photos records , scans or digital photos stores a form of digital inventory management . most of us do not do this in a systematic and efficient way .
we give you a tool , a plan and practical tips on how to back up your pictures , find , protect and use photos again . we consider downloading , ren@@ aming , removing , converting , group@@ ing , securing , evaluating , comp@@ iling , archiving , optimizing , waiting and ex@@ porting image files .
&amp; quot ; Digital inventory management assumes , inde@@ xes , categ@@ ori@@ zes , sec@@ ures , searches , transforms , conf@@ is@@ cated and exports contents that have a monetary or cultural value .
metadata is defined as data about data . metadata is data according to your definition , providing information about or documentation of other data managed by an application or environment .
if you don &apos;t even know how many photos you have , then do not use &amp; digi@@ plug ; the approach to store the metadata both in a database and in the image files guarantees very fast searching and a secure archiving on which you can access with other programs , platforms and formats freely .
the first thing you need to do and know before you integrate any information into your system is the structure of information structure in contrast to the data structure . your image files must somehow be organized on your computer . you must decide whether you want to save them to a reserved drive or on a network drive &amp; etc ; make sure that you have to switch to a larger drive some@@ day .
you may be happy with this structure . holiday pictures can be quickly found over your location unless you were in one year several times at the same location . if you make enough photos , then you will use sub@@ folders such as &amp; eg ; 2008 @-@ 01 , 2008 @-@ 02 &amp; etc . export is then a folder for images you print or publish on a website .
professional photographers have different requirements such as version@@ ing photos , archiving , work procedures , constant supply of images to different topics and a large number of all . within 10 years 95 % of archives and 5 % work files will have and you will not want to re@@ organize your structure for this content .
what types of files fit together ? the separation of file types makes batch processing easier . separate new from old files .
the separation of original and working files simpli@@ fies a backup strategy and migration . you will always know whether you are looking for an original or a derived image .
we also recommend storing metadata in &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zing the metadata on the settings page . this ensures that EX@@ IF and IP@@ TC data are written into the file . if you forget this , you can subsequently save the metadata from the database into the files by selecting the appropriate item in the Album menu .
now you have a lot of information in your database , but what happens if you want to change what ? to do so , &amp; digi@@ plug ; giving them a metadata editor for a number of selected attributes . these are of course the most important ones .
now the real work begins because you should now assign keywords , labels and an evaluation to each photo . of course , you can select all the images that need the same attribute and set the value . this makes sense because you can focus on the best photos in the further work .
let &apos;s start with keywords , keywords , as you often call other programs , or Categories . all three are syn@@ ony@@ ms for the same thing .
if you import catalogues from another source with embedded keywords , then &amp; digi@@ plug ; automatically build the tree for you or insert the images to the right place . sorting the hierarchy within the tree is not a problem and can easily be done by dra@@ gging a sub@@ tree to another . the changed keywords are edited by &amp; digi@@ plug ; updated while keeping the sub@@ trees .
the graphic shows how different metadata is overl@@ apping . this is a very rough representation since each block of metadata consists of many sections .
enough of the keywords - the next section refers to labels or comments , the third important tool to catalo@@ gu@@ ise your metadata .
most people don &apos;t want to see your photos only , you want to share them with your friends , family , other photographers and agencies .
look at this panorama . from the distance there is not even a beautiful beach panorama . if you look at it more closely then you start to see some details , people , the place .
and now I &apos;m telling you that this is the landing place of the Al@@ lies &amp; quot ; O@@ ma@@ ha Be@@ ach@@ quot ; in the French Nor@@ mand@@ y 60 years after landing . wow ! you start to dream of associations , memories , the historical period of time is again present , you may even hear the silence .
for others who look at your photos , the title is perhaps more important than the image itself to generate an interest . if you show pictures you should tell a story . remember , the key is to transmit the meaning to the viewer to help him understand what you are moving about .
it is fine if an image is not perfect if it has the power only to work with a cap@@ tion for itself .
with &amp; digi@@ plug ; you can save as much text , in an internation@@ alized alpha@@ bet ( U@@ TF @-@ 8 ) , as a label . you can even export it for a selection of images at the same time . if you export your images in web galleries , then these labels are exported to your li@@ king and / or the title of the web gallery system .
do you remember the times before GPS ? when you had to find another city without a navigation system ? was it not a boring planet in front of Google Earth ? well , because with pictures the train of the spatial presentation now drives with speed of light .
the possibilities to take advantage of ge@@ olo@@ cation are innumerable and will become even deeper in the future . I &apos;m sure that one day , in the near future , you can virtually recre@@ ate your trips using images with geographic data . this will also display k@@ ml files that you can open with Google Earth . you can also export the pictures to G@@ aller@@ y@@ 2 , Pic@@ as@@ a@@ web , Fli@@ ck@@ r &amp; etc .
&amp; quot ; Cop@@ y@@ left is a word play with copyright and den@@ otes the practice to use copy@@ rights to remove limitations concerning the distribution and modification of copies . the same fre@@ edoms are also valid in all changed versions , i.e. for the work of others .
the following description tells you which information in the setup page of &amp; digi@@ plug ; as information should be stored :
author ( syn@@ onym for creator and author ) : this field should contain your name , or the name of the person who created the photo . if it is not desired to use the name of the photographer , e.g. to protect the identity of the photographer , then the name of a company or organization can &apos;t be changed . this field does not support comm@@ as or sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ ons as separ@@ ators .
author title : associated with the author . this field contains the working title of the photographer . examples can be as : employee photographer , freelance photographer or independent commercial photographer . since this is a note to the author field , it must be filled in as well .
publisher ( syn@@ onym for suppliers ) : use the provider field to identify who works the photo . this does not necessarily have to be the author . if the photographer is working for a news agency such as Reu@@ ters or Associ@@ ated Press , then these organizations can be listed here that you offer the image to others .
it is very important to fill the author and copyright sections , even though they do not provide protection against abuse . anyone who has a little more than basic knowledge in working with computers can delete or modify these , in the image embedded metadata . for private individuals , this is only of little interest for most of your photos . for professionals and semi professionals , this protection is very important .
the digital water@@ mark is unique per image . &amp; digi@@ plug ; will provide such a module for batch processing in the near future .

of course , we don &apos;t talk about CDs that were lost on the street or on a fire . these kinds of losses are the same that can happen to you even in traditional paper photos or neg@@ atives . in this section it is about problems with the so @-@ called New Media .
K@@ roll on@@ TRA@@ CK , the world &apos;s largest data recovery company , has some interesting statistics about the reasons for data loss .
to combat the problem with CDs / DVDs , those cau@@ tious will need to be treated and you may not be trusted for more than a few years . of course you can also buy CDs and DVDs in archi@@ val quality which are longer , more difficult to get and much more expensive .
CD / DVD discs can be un@@ readable but you can reduce this risk in which you can use good disks and good recording devices and store them in the right way . the best DVD recording devices are not much more expensive than the cheapest but you write much more reliable .
CDs and DVDs are very suscep@@ tible to errors even if they are just written . therefore , they use a control sum mechanism to protect themselves . therefore , 75 % of the data is only effective data , the rest we need for format@@ ting and control sums . despite this massive protection they age through chemical ageing , ultra@@ violet light , scratches , dust &amp; etc .
for faulty CDs and DVDs , there is a special program called I@@ so@@ Bu@@ ster which apparently works wonders for CDs and DVDs . it runs on Windows and Linux ; but is not yet available for Mac@@ s . there are also similar applications that read damaged data from damaged disks , hard disks , flash media , USB drives etc .
optical Media : Blu @-@ ray Dis@@ ks seem to capture the format war against the HD DVD . a dual layer Blu @-@ ray disc can store 50 GB and thus almost six times the capacity of a dual @-@ layer DVD with 8.5 GB .
slowly burn with a good capture device to high @-@ quality media in a non @-@ propri@@ ate format . also read the media with a description , date &amp; author mark and then store at a clean , dark dry and in front of animals . do not forget to copy the data to the next generation of media before you can read the last piece of hardware or software that can read these media .
your manufacturer &apos;s guarantees include a new disk , but not the data . Google provides a large field study on the fault mechanisms of hard drives on this subject .
electronic parts of the controller are the most common error reason , S@@ MA@@ RT can not detect these errors . some of S@@ MA@@ RT errors indicate the immediately pending failure . this is especially read errors and reloc@@ ation meters . the expected lifetime is between 4 and 5 years .
this is just the complete loss due to over@@ voltage . of course , you can also save data loss due to a power failure before you have secured the files , but these losses can normally be restored without major problems .
while most electrical devices do not account a lot , it looks different on devices with computer chips and high @-@ speed processes . these can cause serious damage . on your computer , these anom@@ ali@@ es can cause serious ke@@ yp@@ ads , complete data loss , hardware aging , destroyed bo@@ ther@@ boards and other defects . so protect yourself from the inevitable that leads to a loss of time and money .
the most common protection against current peaks is over@@ voltage protection . this is a device that absor@@ bs part of the energy heat and gro@@ unded the rest . it is usually available in the form of a connector strip . remember , however , that not every connector also contains over@@ voltage protection .
if you are looking for over@@ voltage protection , you should ensure that it meets the UL 14@@ 49 standard , which guarantees a certain minimum of protection . you should also ensure that it provides protection against lightning strikes and protects the properly connected devices .
since an over@@ voltage can use any cable to your computer , you should make sure that all peripheral devices connected to your system are protected . this also applies to phone lines and cable mode@@ ms because of this an over@@ voltage can also be achieved . some manufacturers provide over@@ voltage protection devices which also provide a telephone connection for your modem . others provide connection options for the co@@ axial cable of the cable modem and the TV card .
if you have a not@@ ebook , you will need a portable over@@ voltage protection . a variety of these devices are especially designed for not@@ ebooks and therefore very small and they also contain the protection for the modem .
while an over@@ voltage protection protects your system from minor fluctuations in the power lines , it will not really help you in case of a complete failure . even a breakdown of a few seconds can lead to the loss of irre@@ plac@@ eable data . it can therefore be useful to invest in an un@@ interrup@@ tible power supply .
in addition to protecting against over@@ vol@@ tages , these devices can automatically provide battery energy when a power ou@@ tage occurs . some models even allow them to continue working until the current runs again . if you purchase a U@@ PS then you should be sure that they meet the same quality requirements as over@@ voltage protection . furthermore , the lifetime of the battery and the accompanying software is interesting .
consider the potential risk that your computer system is exposed to and compare its security with the costs of avoiding these . a high @-@ quality over@@ voltage protection can cost you up to 20 euro ; 20 . this is only a small price difference if you consider how well your computer is using it . at the end , you should always remember all the cables before you go into the holiday .
the Amazon Web Service contains S3 - Simp@@ le Storage Service - a simple storage service . with the right configuration you can install it as a drive under &amp; Linux ; , Mac , and Windows . this allows you to use it as a backup destination for your software .
compared to hard disks at home however , they are very expensive - 40 GB cost &amp; dollars ; 75 per year and 400 GB cost &amp; dollars ; 500 . furthermore , you need to send the data about the comparatively slow internet .
the solutions are therefore only suitable as a solution against a local data loss of the most important images . it is not a bad solution , but it is not a general securing solution .
Pic@@ as@@ a@@ web ( Google ) , Fli@@ ck@@ r ( Yahoo ) and the photo community 23@@ h@@ q@@ .com provide online storage services available on photos . your free memory is limited to 1 GB and you will not have your pictures in full resolution online .
from the point of view of data backup , the web solutions are very secure . transmission errors are automatically adjusted thanks to the TCP protocol and the large companies offer a backup and distributed memory in the offer .
the diagram shows the elements of the transmission chain on the computer . all trans@@ missions are suscep@@ tible to transfer errors . the file system Z@@ FS and b@@ tr@@ fs at least ensure data integrity between operating system and hard drive .
the worst thing about this is that no one tells you when a transmission error occurred , not when it happened in your hardware . it is quite disturbing that there should be no protection in your computer . no one seems to have thought of it . the Internet with its TCP protocol is a much more secure data path than that in your computer .
un@@ reliable power supplies are another source of transmission losses , since they generate inter@@ ferences within the data streams . in normal file systems , these errors remain un@@ noticed .
even if you are not particularly affected by transmission problems , you should look into the future . already in 2010 you will see thousands of errors per year .
Z@@ FS of Sun Micro@@ systems seems to be one of two candidates who can deal with disk failures on a low level and highly scalable . it is open source , with many patents and is available under a GP@@ L in@@ compatible licence for Solar@@ is and Leopard . we can only hope that it will soon also be available for Linux ; and Windows . read this article in English .
Oracle has started its own initiative with its b@@ tr@@ fs file system . this is still in the alpha state . it uses the same protection mechanism the Z@@ FS is used and is also available for &amp; Linux ; however , it is not yet part of the kernel .
do not under@@ estimate this ! these two factors are responsible for 86 % of data loss in the not@@ ebook and 46 % in work@@ station systems .
data loss due to viruses is less common than most people think . it leads to a lower damage , such as theft or new installations . and it is currently limited to Microsoft systems ; Apple users only know very few viruses and under &amp; Linux ; no longer has been si@@ ghted for a long time .
open source file systems are less prone to data loss than proprietary systems : wrong , NT@@ FS is minimal better than ext@@ 3 , Reiser@@ FS , J@@ FS and X@@ FS to name the most widespread file systems .
journ@@ aling file systems prevent corrupted data and data loss : wrong , only the speed of the investigation process during a sudden interruption during an operation is higher and an un@@ defined status is avoided . however , if a file has not been completely stored before the problem occurred , it is lost .
viruses are the biggest threat to digital data : wrong , theft and human error are the main causes of data loss .
sensors of digital cameras are 1 @-@ 2 aperture settings from fundamental physical limits . it is meant that while the technology develops further , there is a natural limit for this advancement . sensitivity and noise characteristics for all types of light sensors are not far from this limit .
today &apos;s cameras go in the direction of 10 meg@@ api@@ xel numbers . even if this resolution is already too high for compact cameras and the end result is worse for compact cameras . even DS@@ LR cameras have their limit at 10 @-@ 12 meg@@ api@@ x@@ els . for higher resolutions , you need a full @-@ format sensor ( 24@@ x@@ 36@@ mm ) or larger formats .
you get a 7@@ 50@@ GB hard drive today for 100 &amp; euro ; so don &apos;t worry anyone else for data loss . 6 % of all PCs are affected by a data loss every year . so , secure your data after a plan and test this backup before you do anything dangerous such as re@@ installing your operating system , the replacement of disks or the res@@ izing of hard drives .
suppose you make your back@@ ups every day on an external SATA drive . if , then one day , a flash strikes you luck if the drive was not connected at the moment .
a disaster strikes locally and destro@@ ys a lot . forget aircraft accidents : fire , water , electricity , children and theft are dangerous enough for your data .
therefore , desktop diff@@ ra@@ ction always means a not local storage . bring your back@@ ups up the stairs , into the neighbour house , into your office or similar .
there is another advantage of the physical separation : as mentioned above is a common reason for a data loss despite backup the panic . if you have a backup that is not immediately available , then you can save that one day .
full backup : a complete backup of all files to backup . it is a snapshot without history and represents a complete copy at a time .
differential backup : a backup of the files that have been changed since the last complete backup . creates a complete snapshot at two times : one of the complete backup and the last differential backup .
incre@@ mental backup : a backup of the files that have been changed since the last backup . creates multiple snap@@ shots . you can restore the original status at any time on which such a backup was made . this backup comes with a version@@ ing system closest to the exception that it only scanned and is not ongoing .
r@@ sync is a wonderful little tool that you can easily set up on your machines . unlike script @-@ controlled FTP sessions or other types of file transferring scripts , r@@ sync only copies the difference of files that were actually changed . this is compressed and if you want to increase security over ss@@ h .
backup important images directly after you have saved them on your computer to a DVD or other optical media .
this approach gives you enough time to detect and restore losses . at the same time , you come for backup but with &amp; lt ; 130 % of the size of the working files . in the end , you will have a complete daily version of the last 7 @-@ 14 days , a weekly snapshot for at least one month and a snapshot for each month .
topics : metadata in the image file stored IP@@ TC information , associated X@@ MP files , retain original memory , scal@@ ability , media , re@@ viewing images and metadata , copying images to the next generation of media , applications , operating systems , virtualization , viewing devices , ... , using the internet .
so valuable pictures survive the next 40 year , that is about the period in which you really are interested in you because they remind you of your childhood or youth , there are two strategies that should be considered :
as the future is unfor@@ es@@ eeable due to your nature , you have to consider all that is being said today with caution and re @-@ evaluate as time passes . unfortunately , there is no other way to get a certain vig@@ il@@ ance . every 5 @-@ 8 years you should ask yourself how the current system is backwards compatible . the fewer variants you have used in the past , the easier it is to evaluate the issues of the future .
this question should actually be answered based on the explanations in this document . use or change to open standards supported by many applications .
virtualization is available for everyone nowadays . so if you have an old system that is important to read your images , keep it up and install it in a virtual machine for later use .
on the other hand , the advice is quite simple : every time you change your computer architecture , memory and backup technology , or your file format , you should check your library and convert if necessary to a newer standard . stay with open standards .
scal@@ ability is the ability to change a system in its size . this means increasing the size of the system .
let &apos;s assume that you have planned scal@@ ability and the area you want to enlarge to a dedicated disk or partition . with * ni@@ x systems like &amp; Linux , you can copy this area and reloc@@ ate it to a new disk :
check with the d@@ mes@@ g command if your new plate was detected by the system , but do not app@@ end it .
&amp; dollars ; dd if = / dev / s@@ db &#91; # &#93; of = / dev / s@@ d@@ c # source is / dev / s@@ d@@ c # source is / dev / s@@ d@@ c &amp; dollar ; par@@ ted res@@ ize / dev / s@@ d@@ c # source is / dev / s@@ d@@ c # source ; res@@ iz@@ e@@ 2@@ fs / dev / sad@@ c@@ 1 # change the size of the file if necessary
open source standards have the great advantage of an open specification . even if there is no longer any software that can read it , you can create it yourself . this task becomes easier from year to year .
GIF is a proprietary , patented format that slowly disappears from the market . it should therefore no longer be used .
P@@ NG has been developed as an open source standard that should replace GIF . it is los@@ s@@ less , supports X@@ MP , Ex@@ in@@ f and IP@@ TC metadata , 16 @-@ bit per color channel and full transparency . P@@ NG can store gam@@ ma@@ - and chrom@@ ati@@ city data for improved color assignment for hetero@@ geneous platforms .
TI@@ FF is widely used as a picture format . TI@@ FF can be stored in un@@ compressed form or in a container with a los@@ s@@ less compression algorithm ( default ) . it manages images in high quality , but requires very large files . however , a problem is that this format has been adapted by many people . therefore , there are more than 50 different types and not all applications can work with all types .
D@@ NG has been developed on the TI@@ FF / EP format and committed to using metadata . a handful of camera manufacturers already provide D@@ NG and we hope that Canon and Nikon will use it some@@ time .
this may be one of the reasons why in 2001 , Adobe has introduced its XML @-@ based X@@ MP technology to replace the &amp; quot ; image resource block &amp; quot ; technology of the 1990s . it is a coding technology that allows users to em@@ bed their data into a file itself . the file information is stored with the extension &amp; quot ; .x@@ mp@@ quot ; stored for XML / R@@ DF .
many photographers prefer to archive it from an original recording , mostly in raw format . X@@ MP fits this because it stores the metadata separately from the image file . however , it can cause problems when linking the metadata file and the image file , and as noted above , the raw format will be obsol@@ ete . therefore , you should consider whether you use D@@ NG as a container and put everything there together .
the Dublin Core Met@@ adata Initiative is an open organization supporting fully compatible online metadata standards that support a wide range of applications and business models . D@@ C@@ MI &apos;s activities include work on architecture and modeling , discussions and collaborative work in the D@@ C@@ MI communities and the D@@ C@@ MI groups , yearly conferences and workshops , standard connections and educational efforts to achieve far @-@ reaching acceptance of metadata standards and practices .
import images from the camera , card reader or scanner . as long as the images on the camera are edited , you can use this as a temporary backup .
convert raw files to D@@ NG and save them in your raw archive . this feature is not yet implemented .
for a fine editing , you can use external programs . if you edit the images again with &amp; edited , then you should add the metadata again .
protect the copy@@ righ@@ ted images for copyright using a digital water@@ mark . export them first in web galleries , code in MPEG , use in contact sheets , print &amp; etc ;
the camera interface is not the only way to get your photos in &amp; edited ; in the Ad@@ ding a Photo to an Album , you will find a description of how you can add photos you already have on your hard disk . however , the camera interface provides you with many advanced settings for im@@ porting images to your database .
to use your digital camera with &amp; digi@@ plug , connect them to the computer , turn the camera to the display mode and turn it on . another description can be found in the manual of your camera .
if you start the camera interface , it tries to connect to your camera . if the connection is made , a finished indicator appears at the bottom and the thumb@@ nails of all photos on the camera will appear . some cameras do not display thumb@@ nails . if this is the case , the file names and a symbol for your application will be displayed on the camera for each file , photos , movies , music etc .
before you download the photos on your computer , you may need the camera information for each entry . you can view the properties of an entry or its metadata with the side rails features and metadata from the camera interface .
this dialog displays file properties and photo information stored internally by the camera . a symbol indicates that the image has not yet been downloaded to your computer . note that some digital cameras do not have all the information available .
the tab metadata shows the internal metadata such as Ex@@ if , manufacturer &apos;s remarks , GPS etc. of the image . this information is the same as the Met@@ adata page strip from &amp; digi@@ kam &apos;s main window ; or image editing . note that these metadata is not available for some digital cameras .
the easiest way to download photos on your computer is the click on the button Download and then download the selection of All . this invites all photos from your camera to a single album in &amp; digi@@ code ; . when downloading the photos are not deleted and we recommend you to check if the pictures were downloaded in an album before you delete the photos from the camera .
if you do not want to download all the photos , you can only select the desired with the standard selection methods of &amp; k@@ de ; once you have selected the photos , use the Download button and then download the selected one . the selected button will be downloaded as long as you have selected some photos .
if your camera supports this , a new option is available . in this case , the new images are marked with an ast@@ er@@ isk in the preview window . if you choose this option , only the new images will be downloaded .
when you use the buttons to download or download selected folders , a dialog with which you can select the target album will appear in which the photos are stored . you can read the list of existing albums , as usual folder , in the section My Albums . then select the target album from the list and press OK .
after selecting the target album , press OK , and &amp; edited ; load the photos from the camera to the album .
once you have downloaded the desired photos , you can delete them from the camera . you can all delete them at once by using the Del@@ ete All button . if you want to delete only some , you have to select them first and then use Del@@ ete Sel@@ ected to delete them .
note that there is no way to recover photos that you have deleted from the camera . you should therefore carefully check that the photos have been successfully downloaded into a digi@@ p@@ ate ; - album downloaded before you delete them from the camera . if you want to completely delete the camera file , you should do so via the camera module , as this is much faster .
the file names are normally used again after the photos are deleted from the camera . this can lead to dup@@ licate file names , if you load photos from different recording galleries into the same album . therefore , it may be useful to integrate the date and time when the image was taken into the file name .
in the next section you will find options for turning and mirr@@ oring the image and for file @-@ based sub @-@ albums . if you use this latter option , a folder will be created automatically per day .
the options Dur@@ ing the transfer will open three more options that will be executed before the photos are stored on the disk . the first two relate the data about the author in the section Standard Auto@@ identity . if you select this , the corresponding entries will be copied from the ex@@ if information into the IP@@ TC fields . with the last option , you can correct date &amp; time for all downloaded images .
for example , if you want a different date format than the default format , you can use the pre@@ fix phot@@ o- % Y@@ - % m@@ - % d % H : % M : % S . turn on the date &amp; time option . for further adjustments , you should read the command str@@ f@@ time .
if you use the option camera fil@@ en@@ ame , you have the option to change the file names in lo@@ wer@@ case . or in upper@@ case , if you prefer this .
the new fil@@ en@@ ame , the &amp; edited ; for a photo , is displayed below the name that the camera provides in the preview . your settings for ren@@ aming will be saved and used automatically when you open the camera window next time .
&amp; edited ; can use all the information about the orientation of the camera at the time point of recording to perform an automatic turn during shut@@ down . not all cameras provide this information . in the Met@@ adata section , you can read more details about the information that your camera embedded in the photo .
the automatic turn is usually switched on , and if your camera doesn &apos;t deliver this information , it lets &amp; edit ; the photo in original orientation . if you want to turn off the automatic turn , use the Advanced button and select the automatic turning in the bottom of the window .
if your camera provides information about the date on which the photo was taken , it can be used to automatically create sub @-@ albums in the target album . all images with the same date are loaded into the same sub @-@ album . not all cameras provide this information . in the Met@@ a data section , you can read what information your camera could have embedded in the photos .
this option is normally switched off , and digi@@ ti@@ zed in this case ; the photos directly in the target album . if you want to change this , you need to turn this option on . use the Advanced button and select the date @-@ based bottom bar at the bottom of the window .
the easiest way to load photos from your computer to your camera is the download button . then select up@@ loading . the file selection dialog &amp; k@@ de ; appears where you can select the files to be uploaded . you can also select more than one file with the default &amp; k@@ de ; methods .
after the image sel@@ ector has been completed , it asks &amp; edited ; you where the images should be uploaded . a folder selection dialog appears for the camera . select the folder you want and press OK to start the upload . the images will not be deleted from your computer .
GPS ( Global Posi@@ tioning System ) is used as a general term in this document . this refers to a position indicated in long@@ itude and l@@ atitude and which can be displayed on a map . the data can be determined by the American GPS , the Russian G@@ LO@@ NAS , the European GA@@ LI@@ LE@@ O or any other system .
not only for professional photographers , it can be interesting to link an image with a precise geographical location . not everyone uses a plane to map an area by automatic recording of the GPS data . environmental planners , military , police , architecture offices and real estate agents can use this ability .
if you have forgotten where exactly the photo was taken , you can open a browser that displays the area . if you want to send a postcard to another &amp; digi@@ plug ; users who want to locate the location of the photo , or just want to document that aspect , it is good to save the position data of a photo .
the question is how does the GPS data come into the picture ? first , you should know that there are many GPS data fields , such as direction , sem@@ it@@ rail@@ ings and map references . the question is actually more about how the data come into these fields ? there are at least three ways to achieve this . directly with the right hardware , via post @-@ processing of GPS data and image files with the K@@ IP@@ I module for geographical allocation ( hand@@ book ) and last on manual input of known places .
as far as we know , there is currently no camera that has integrated a GPS unit . but there are a few that work together with GPS receivers . either as a map module or by transmitting data with a cable or Bluetooth .
cameras with GPS interface : Co@@ y@@ ot@@ e@@ Eye i@@ PA@@ Q I@@ ke Ko@@ da@@ k D@@ CS Pro Nikon DS@@ LR Ri@@ co@@ h Pro G@@ 3 Sony
downloading GPS data from one device can be done with g@@ ps@@ man or g@@ ps@@ ba@@ bel . however , you need to save these data in GP@@ X format , as this is the only format supported by the geographical mapping module .
there are various programs for &amp; Windows ; and Mac OS that can extract and cor@@ relate the data of images and the GPS . on the following page you can do the same on &amp; Linux ; g@@ ps@@ Cor@@ r or g@@ ps@@ Photo
if you know the long@@ itude and l@@ atitude or other data then you can use this script that works with the Ex@@ i@@ f@@ Tool by Phi@@ l Har@@ vey . it uses the acci@@ dent@@ als of hair@@ pin coordinates created e.g. map@@ s.@@ goo@@ gle .
map@@ s.@@ goo@@ gle@@ .com shows no European street maps . here are some European sites , at least in French , German and Spanish , which show all navigation details for Europe .
&amp; digi@@ plug ; tries to give you as much control over your workflow as possible . there are many settings that change the behavior of &amp; edited . to access these settings , you need to select Edit Details . the settings dialog is divided into eight pages . you can switch between them by clicking on the icons on the left .
select action can be displayed on a saved preview or image editing will be set . you will then set the default behavior of &amp; digi@@ plug ; specify when you click on an entry in the main view .
this page contains , as shown below , the standardi@@ zation and copyright data . this data is automatically written into the corresponding IP@@ TC data fields if the option was selected when downloading from the camera interface . also with a database synchronization , these data are written into the IP@@ TC fields .
author title is a syn@@ onym for command line : this field should contain the professional name of the photographer . this can be desig@@ nations such as the photographer , freelance photographer or independent , commercial photographer . since this is a more detailed description of the author field , it must also be filled .
publisher is a syn@@ onym for providers : use this field to specify the image that the photo offers . this does not have to be the author if it works for a news agency such as Reu@@ ters or Associ@@ ated Press , then these organizations should be listed here since this picture is a stock photo , then the group or agency that provides the image will be listed here .
the IP@@ TC actions store the data in the appropriate IP@@ TC ri@@ ms . this ensures that the metadata is permanently contained in the image and not only in the &amp; digi@@ plug database ; this metadata is also available to other programs and can be imported into &amp; digi@@ plug ; imported without being lost .
cap@@ tions as embedded in@@ scrip@@ tions ( J@@ FI@@ F ) in JPEG images : this synchron@@ izes the comments you add to your photos with the cap@@ tions embedded in the images . this allows your cap@@ tions to be read from other image viewers .
the Settings page contains all the information that appears when the mouse cursor is in the main window over a file . depending on the selected option , this information is displayed or not .
&amp; # 160 ; edited ; supports a number of different image formats and some video and audio formats . to specify which file types &amp; digi@@ code ; to view , you can add and remove the file extensions of this list .
the default settings can be reset by pressing the Update button on the right of each category .
each time you open the be@@ acon , these settings are turned on . however , some pictures have different sizes and the synchron@@ ous mode is not available . the option &amp; quot ; In the whole image size , you can only use on fast hosts . if you have one , then you can get better viewing results .
by default , the image processing uses a black background behind the displayed photos . if you prefer a different color , you can select it here . you can turn off the toolbar if you use the image editing in full screen mode .
over@@ - and under@@ exposed areas of an image can be marked with dark or light color in the picture . these colors are specified here . in the image processing , this View Mode can be switched on and off with F@@ 10 and F@@ 11 .
with Chro@@ ma sub@@ sampling it is meant that the images are enco@@ ded in a higher resolution of the lumin@@ ance than in the color information . please read this article in Wikipedia for more detailed explanation .
with the P@@ NG image setting , you can reduce the size of P@@ NG files . this operation does not reduce the image quality since P@@ NG is using a los@@ s@@ less algorithm . if you have a fast machine , you can set this value to high compression .
with the TI@@ FF file compression you can turn off the default compression algorithm for TI@@ FF images . this reduces the size of TI@@ FF images . it does not affect the image quality since the default algorithm works los@@ s@@ less .
with the setting of los@@ s@@ less JPEG 2000 files , you can save los@@ s@@ less . even if you select the los@@ sy setting , the relationship between quality loss and file size is far better than normal JPEG . as this paragraph has been written , metadata has not been supported yet , but was in the planning .
in previous versions of &amp; digi@@ kam , image editing was only a picture viewer for photos . currently , it is very fast becoming a tool for manipul@@ ating your photos . with this dialog you can change the image editing settings .
the standard feature is that all green pixels are the same . if the linear green pixels of the CCD sensor react more sensitive to ultra@@ violet light than the pixels with odd lines , this difference produces a grid pattern in the output . this option marks the image a little soft , but eliminates the 2x@@ 2 grid pattern with the V@@ N@@ G@@ - or A@@ HD quality method .
if this option is set , the white balance of the camera is used . otherwise , if set , the auto color balance is used .
this setting is only used when the white balance is not set . standard is a fixed color balance based on a white card that was photographed in the sunlight .
this setting is supported only for Fu@@ ji Super CCD S@@ LR cameras . using the second sensors has the effect that under@@ exposed images in four steps get more details in the top lights . for other cameras this option is ignored .
the default is the highlights , so the parts of your images that are burned , because of the inability of your camera to capture the pointed @-@ out white in the settings . the setting colors will create some unusual results as it shows the highlights in various ros@@ ettes . last , you can attempt to construct some parts of the missing information from the peak lights to re@@ construct .
this is possible because blue pixels in general are not as fast enough as green and red . &amp; digi@@ plug ; and d@@ cra@@ w therefore try to re@@ construct the missing green and red parts from the still not saturated blue pixels . of course , this is a question of how much color or white you want .
if you select the option Rec@@ on@@ struc@@ ting , you get the possibility to set a level . here , a value of three is a compromise and / should therefore be individually adapted for each image .
set the lumin@@ ance value according to your taste . you probably have to set it slightly higher than standard 1 . however , this can be done later in the image options of the &amp; digi@@ plug ; image processing . in order to keep the time for the dem@@ os@@ a@@ icing small , you should proceed conserv@@ atively .
a Dem@@ os@@ a@@ icing algorithm is a digital image process to calculate a complete image from the sub @-@ raw data that come from the color @-@ filtered image sensor that many cameras have and which provides a matrix of colored pixels . this algorithm is also known as C@@ FA inter@@ pol@@ ation or color rendering .
&amp; digi@@ plug ; and D@@ cra@@ w provide you three alternatives : bil@@ ine@@ ar , V@@ NG Inter@@ pol@@ ation and A@@ HD Inter@@ pol@@ ation . after some tests it looks as if A@@ HD Inter@@ pol@@ ation ( for Adap@@ tive Hom@@ ogen@@ esis Direc@@ ted ) was the first algorithm used by D@@ cra@@ w . however , it creates color art@@ ef@@ acts on the edges .
if you know the color deviation of your lenses , you can set the red and blue corrections here . this is certainly the best method for color sof@@ tening as it is carried out during the rough conversion .
a profile transl@@ ates the color information and gives instructions how to get it back . there are also L@@ CMS and &amp; digi@@ kam ; information such as the color information from a color space in the others are to translate the colors as precisely as possible .
behavior Ques@@ tions when an image is opened in image processing / color management module starts with raw files .
color Profile folder Set the folder , such as / usr / share / color / ICC or / home / user / .@@ color / ICC , where you save all your profiles . &amp; digi@@ plug ; examine this folder then during startup .
settings of the ICC profiles you have here the possibility &amp; quot ; default squ@@ ot ; to leave for your profiles . everything can be changed later when opening the raw file .
the color management view is an alternative to X@@ cali@@ b or Ar@@ gy@@ ll . here are just your pictures color @-@ managed not the entire screen .
the input profiles should fit to the camera manufacturer and model you use . not all profiles are created in the same way . there are some , e.g. Canon , which do not contain color @-@ mapping or g@@ amma correction . currently , d@@ wind@@ w g@@ amma does not correct conver@@ sions at 16 bit depth . this means that you have to carry out the color mapping itself .
there are other options like the Soft @-@ Pro@@ of profile that you can em@@ ulate on how to print your picture from one device . this is very useful before you print image as your printer may have a smaller color range than your camera and some colors may be very saturated . this could be corrected manually instead of rel@@ ying on the blind algorithm of your printer .
for most cameras it is quite obvious which color profile is intended for . unfortunately not on the models of Canon . therefore , here is a table of cameras and profiles that match together . this answer is naturally in@@ official :
the Canon profile extension lets you recognize the style for the destination : F for a precise style , L for landscapes , N for Neut@@ ral , P for portrait and S for the standard style .
K@@ IP@@ I is the &amp; k@@ de ; image plugin interface . it is an interface that is supported by a number of &amp; k@@ de ; image viewer and image editing . by deplo@@ ying this interface , &amp; digi@@ plug can support many modules that have been written to work with any program that supports the K@@ IP@@ I interface .
if your distribution has the K@@ IP@@ I modules installed , you will see a list of available modules . select the modules you want to use , and these are then loaded by &amp; digi@@ plug ; these modules appear as new entries in the main window menu and in addition , you will also find some in the context menu of the previ@@ ews .
short commands for tasks performed by modules can be set in the menu under Settings short commands .
more information ( in English ) about K@@ IP@@ I modules can be obtained via the K@@ IP@@ I project under ht@@ t@@ p : / / www.@@ ki@@ pi @-@ plug@@ ins@@ .org or in the manuals of the K@@ IP@@ I modules .
the sli@@ der settings should be easy to understand . the upper knob adjust@@ s the time between the picture transitions , normally 4 @-@ 5 seconds are good . the other check boxes turn the metadata on or off , which are displayed at the bottom of the pictures during the ad .
the camera features on the left hand show a list of all currently supported cameras . on the right side there is a button Automatic Det@@ ection , which tries to identify a camera connected to the computer . if you want to use this , make sure the camera is properly connected , switched on and in the image display mode . currently , serial , USB and USB / Fire@@ Wire mass storage are supported .
at the bottom , you can set the path for USB and Fire@@ Wire ( I@@ EE@@ E @-@ 13@@ 94 or i @-@ Link ) mass storage cameras . this field is only active when you have selected a USB or Fire@@ Wire mass storage camera from the camera list . you must specify the path , / m@@ nt / camera or / m@@ nt / Rem@@ ov@@ able , where you can mount your camera .
to use your digital camera with &amp; digi@@ plug , you need to connect the camera to your computer , bring it to the display mode and turn it on .
check if &amp; edited ; the camera automatically detects . if not , you can set camera models and port manually . after you have set up your camera , your camera will appear in the camera &apos;s menu .
you can select any name for your camera . it will be displayed in the C@@ ameras of the main window . if you have more than one camera , you can paste them here .
with the confirmation dialog for moving &gt; Images in the M@@ Ã¼l@@ lei@@ mer , you can specify the dialog of &amp; digi@@ plug ; when del@@ eting a photo in an album , you can find more details in del@@ eting a photo and del@@ eting an album .
editorial changes through the right side@@ bar can be tac@@ itly deleted by &amp; edited ; if you use the option changes in the right side@@ bar without re@@ questioning , otherwise you will need to save the changes using the button changes .
you can also display the &amp; digi@@ plug greeting image display ; disable when starting . this might accelerate the start @-@ up of &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zing ; .
the setting When starting after new photos comp@@ els &amp; edited ; to search the base folder for new or deleted albums / photos . this extends the start time of &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zing ; if something was deleted from the base folder , it asks &amp; edited ; you , whether it should delete them from the database .
various color schemes can be edited in &amp; edited , to customize the main window to your taste . these settings can be selected under Settings Design from the toolbar . previ@@ ewing the available designs is listed below :
these designs have been defined in simple text files . if you are interested in creating a new design for &amp; digi@@ kam , you will find more information about this in this tutorial .
&amp; edited ; contains a fast image processing with some basic tools . you can use them to view your photos and for correction and improvement . image editing can be started by clicking with the left mouse button on the preview of an image or through the context menu of the preview and selection of the ad / editing .
the image processing contains a number of tools to improve your images . some of them are available as modules in &amp; digi@@ plug ; therefore , they may not be part of your distribution . for more information on the K@@ IP@@ I modules , see the Image Processing section .
a status line at the bottom of the window , the file name , current file number , magni@@ fying factor , and the current image size .
a menu bar at the top and below is the toolbar for quick access to the most frequently required functions .
the editing functions of the image processing change your photos . however , none of the features will change the original photo before using File Save or the Save button from the toolbar . note that you cannot recover the original photo once you have saved the image .
so you should possibly make a copy of your image before you change it . you can do this with File Save as .
as long as you have not saved the photo , you can restore the original image by using the Rest@@ ore button from the File menu or using the button The button Rest@@ ore the Image Processing Rec@@ over in the toolbar . you then lose any change you &apos;ve done in the photo since the last saving .
almost any image processing action can be und@@ one or recovered . you can und@@ o the last action by selecting Edit or Rest@@ ore by selecting Edit from the menu .
if you use this frequently , you should remember the keyboard short@@ cut , C@@ trl ; -@@ Z to und@@ o and remember C@@ trl ; Shift @-@ Z to restore .
if you press the &amp; L@@ MB for a moment , you will receive a context menu . if you select one of the menu entries , all actions in between will also be revers@@ ed or restored .
once you have started the image processing , you can move between the photos in the same album or the same keyword by using the navigation buttons in the toolbar , image up , picture , or the entries in the File menu . if you have made changes to the current photo , you &apos;ll be asked if you want to save them .
you can enter the picture and zoom out in which you use C@@ trl ; mouse wheel or the symbols in the toolbar or the entries in the check menu .
to adjust a photo to the window size , you can use this button in the toolbar : select magni@@ fying factor automatically
view Full Screen mode displays the picture in full screen mode . you will see the normal view where you can use the Es@@ c key . if you do not wish to do so , you can change it in the Edit &amp; Edit Settings dialog .
if you want to print the current image , you can print the image in the File menu and get the default &amp; k@@ de ; print dialog . you can adjust the settings here before you print your photo .
from the main menu you can print individual images or whole sentences . you only need to print the images with the standard methods and select from the menu Album Export Print Assistant . if you follow the wizard , you just need to make your choice .
the &amp; digi@@ plug ; main window has a side bar on the right that provides important information and actions for the selected images . the same page strip is available without the navigation arrows , even in image editing . it is displayed when one of the five tabs is cli@@ cked :
multiple Click on the same tab leaves the page bar to appear or disappear into the margins again .
the text is U@@ TF @-@ 8 compatible , which means that all special characters are allowed . cap@@ tions are copied to the EX@@ IF and IP@@ T@@ C@@ - fields so that you can be used by other programs .
the IP@@ TC data only supports ASCII characters and is limited to 2000 characters . all comments are truncated after 2000 characters and special characters are converted . if you want to use the IP@@ TC labelling field in other applications , you should consider these limitations .
after you have commented it , use either the user button or simply change to the next image , the cap@@ tions will then be saved .
in addition to the application button , there is a button More . with this you can read more metadata from the selected file or database . however , you can also write the metadata into the files . however , this is always done when you have chosen a metadata setting that is always written in the images .
the rating shows a rating scheme from 0 to 5 stars and can be used in search and sorting . it can be applied either with a single mouse @-@ click on the 5 stars in the side@@ bar or with the keyboard short@@ cut C@@ trl + 0 ... 5 . to evaluate multiple images simultaneously , select them and use the context menu .
the evaluation is written into the IP@@ TC field Ur@@ gency . the coding follows the scheme in the following table :
the keyword list shows a search box to filter the keywords , the keyword tree and a drop @-@ down box with the keywords used previously in this page .
the keyword tree is dynamically adjusted to the entered search word . you can restrict the number of options in search of a keyword quickly . this ability is particularly useful when you have many keywords .
the input field at the bottom end is a further relief when entering keywords for a picture series . if you have entered different keywords , they are saved for quick access .
keywords can also be set by selecting the appropriate check boxes in the tree . all keywords of an image are stored in the keyword IP@@ TC .
if you select multiple images in the main view and you select a keyword in the keyword tree , it will only be applied to the highlighted image and not to the entire range . if you want to add a keyword , please read the keyword filter section .
the keyword filter page is used to change the selection of images displayed in the main window . normally , the left side bar is used with their Album , - date , keyword and search views . if additionally one or more keyword filters are used on the right , only the intersection of these two is displayed .
you can also drag and drop tags . suppose you have selected multiple images in the main view to provide you with keywords . if the keyword already exists , you can simply drag it from the right side bar and put it on the selection .
in the upper example , the main window displays the images on a calendar day . the keyword filter is set on no keywords , which reduces the amount to three images . you have been selected using C@@ trl + a , and afterwards a keyword has been drawn from the right keyword tree to the selection and stored there . a dialog asks if this keyword is to be set .
this search for changes takes place at any start of the program . it can also be switched off under Settings Vari@@ ety .
if you have created and created a rule and notice that it should be one or more , you can easily change this by double @-@ clicking on the text and in the control area .
( 1 ) : the entry after which is searched in the database . this can be an album , name , keyword , image , keyword , etc .
( 3 ) : the argument for the operator which is a name or string that is already set in the database .
for example , you can specify an Advanced search for all elements of the database using the following options :
if you want to group options , just use the check box at the end of the rule and then use the Group button . the options then look like this :
why have Pic@@ as@@ a@@ web and Fli@@ ck@@ r not listed ? the free disk space is limited to 1@@ GB and you will not want to save the images in full resolution .
this article / tutorial was mainly written by El@@ le Stone . special thanks to El@@ le for this work . I mainly adapted it to &amp; edited ; s specific implementation .
the reason why you use a color management workflow is that the colors that come from your camera or scanner will have a predictable deviation from the actually photographed or scanned colors . with a color management workflow you can achieve that the colors on your monitor correspond to those of your camera or scanner and that match the colors you print or publish in the web to those from your digital dark@@ room .
when the theme comes to color management , everyone wants to know which buttons he has to press for the results he wants . unfortunately , color management means that you make informed decisions at every point of the image processing work@@ flows . in addition , you should provide you with sufficient background information about color management . in addition , you should make links with deeper information to make your own informed decisions so that you get the desired result .
if your image workflow matches all six criteria listed below , you don &apos;t have to worry about color management .
you work on a monitor that is calibr@@ ated to the s@@ RGB colour space . ( see below for more information )
their only other image editions are by e @-@ mail or the web , where s@@ RGB is the de facto standard .
so if s@@ RGB is working so well and makes life for everyone so easy , why should one use another color space and thus have to think about color management ?
a visual example of the limitation of s@@ RGB compared to the colors we can really see is presented below . it shows a 2 @-@ dimensional representation of all colors we can see , the hor@@ ses@@ ho@@ e region , and the colors in s@@ RGB colour space , the tri@@ angular region .
if you want to compare the 2 @-@ dimensional representation of s@@ RGB with some bigger color spaces , you can visit Bruce Lind@@ blo@@ oms &apos;s excellent site and click Info and then on Information About RGB Working Sp@@ aces .
do I have to chart my monitor when I decided to work only in s@@ RGB colour space ?
yes ! whether you work in the s@@ RGB colour space or not , you have to chart your monitor , since s@@ RGB assumes that your monitor is s@@ RGB . if you work as a s@@ RGB colour space , you either need to chart your monitor on the s@@ RGB standard , use a suitable monitor profile or both .

this tool provides five automatic corrections , which can improve a picture in most cases . therefore , use it before attempting any further manual processing .
the functions Norm@@ alization , Balance , Automatic balance and Con@@ trast extend from the Cor@@ rec@@ ting Automatic correc@@ ting attempt automatic from your colors to make the best . you will need to experiment with these effects to see which works best with your photo .
norm@@ alize : this method scales the lumin@@ ance values over the entire image so that the dark@@ est point is black and the brigh@@ test point is as bright as possible without changing its color shade . this function is often a magic correction for images that are dark or washed out .
balance : this method adjust@@ s the light intensity factor of the colors of the selected image , so that the hist@@ ogram of the intensity channel is as flat as possible . sometimes the same produces very good results when improving the contrast of an image , sometimes it produces only rub@@ b@@ ish . it is a very powerful operation that causes miracles in a picture or destro@@ ys it .
automatic adjustment : this method maxim@@ izes the colour range in the red , green and blue channel . it detects the dark and light border tones and adjust@@ s the red , green and blue channels to the entire hist@@ ogram area .
contrast : this method improves the contrast and brightness of the RGB values of an image by shifting the lowest and highest values to the highest possible range and a new ji@@ b of all values in between . this is only visible in washed pictures and can be a good correction for bad photos .
the white balance of &amp; digi@@ kam ; is a semi @-@ automatic tool to carry out the white balance of a photo .
the white balance correction is a bit limited since it is used over a color space with 8 @-@ bit per color . if you are too far from the original image , areas with over@@ exposure can occur . if you can perform the white balance in the blank mode , which works in 16 @-@ bit mode , then your possibilities for correction will be better .
this tool is based on a white balance algorithm protected by Pa@@ wel T. J@@ och@@ ym . they start it using the menu entry colors white balance of image processing .
the preview window can be adjusted in size . on the left side you can see both the original image and the preview of the target image . the preview will dynamically adjust the settings of the tool . if you want to see the original white balance again , it is enough to click on the sub@@ window .
the preview of the target image has a red marker . the lumin@@ ance of the pixel under this constra@@ int is shown as a vertical line in the hist@@ ogram .
on the right side you see a hist@@ ogram that changes dynamically as soon as you change a parameter . this hist@@ ogram is very helpful , even in well lit images , most pixels have very small lumin@@ ance values . with one button you can decide whether one of the three colors or your sum is displayed . the sum is called L@@ umin@@ ance .
the contrast of your result depends on shadow , satur@@ ation and g@@ amma . the shadow alignment allows you to improve or di@@ mming the shadow details of your photos .
to play An@@ stat with the above controls , you should use the color temperature pi@@ p@@ ette . press this button and then somewhere on the image preview to use the selected color for calculating the color temperature of the white balance . in this way , also the temperature and green values are set automatically .
in addition , you can set the white balance with the list of pres@@ ets . the following settings are available :
the over@@ exposure indicator increases the colors when more than one color channel of the pixel is over@@ exposed . you will see the combined result in white balance . this is shown in the preview as a pure indicator and has no effect on the final image .
the buttons save as and load do exactly this . each setting of the white balance you have set you can save it into a text file and load it later .
the Pre@@ ferences Button res@@ ets all filter values to their default values and the associated neutral white balance . note that neutral settings will result in a different picture than your original . if you save this , your original image will be changed .
you can set the encoding depth per color channel of the edited image here . 8 @-@ bit encoding is the widely used JPEG format , 16 @-@ bit encoding is better suited for high quality pictures . however , this encoding also requires more disk space , computing time and is only available for formats P@@ NG , P@@ N@@ M , TI@@ FF and D@@ NG .
this tool opens the same dialog as the editing of raw images . it uses the change and assignment of color profiles . color mapping can be done by the sub@@ window for the brightness . a detailed guide for using color profiles allows you to consult the chapter color management .
another important tool is to find color correction in the menu . this tool provides an integrated way to adjust several color channels at the same time , so that you can use them for several photos . this is helpful if your camera or scanner will always make the same error and you will always need the same correction .
a very powerful way to correct exposure problems is the tool for gra@@ dation that you can find under Col@@ ors Gra@@ dation in the menu .
the &amp; digi@@ plug ; tool colour effects provide you with four color effects , a solar heating effect , a Vel@@ via filter , a ne@@ on effect and a corner filter .
in times of the chemical processing , Solar@@ isation , also called Sab@@ ati@@ er , was created when a partially developed pressure was replaced with a short flash light and then completed the development of the image . this had the effect that the lighter areas darker and the colors were inver@@ ted by the second illumination . this was a partial neg@@ atively of the image . this tool allows you to adjust this interesting effect fine .
the intensity controls the solar process . at approx . 50 % intensity , the picture shows what is chem@@ ically feasible .
this is an example of the solar is@@ ation effect . the original image is the ( 1 ) and that processes the ( 2 ) . the applied intensity is 30 % .
the vi@@ vi@@ d filter simul@@ ates the so @-@ called &amp; quot ; Vel@@ vi@@ aqu@@ ot ; effect . it differs from a satur@@ ation by having a stronger contrast effect that makes the colors brilliant and g@@ lowing . try it easy , it beauti@@ fies many photos .
Vel@@ via is the brand name for a recycled colour film produced by the Japanese company Fu@@ ji@@ film . the name is a composition of &amp; quot ; Vel@@ vet Medi@@ aqu@@ ot ; and thus a reference for its smooth image structure . Vel@@ via offers very saturated colours in daylight and high contrasts .
the ne@@ on filter simul@@ ates ne@@ on light on the contrast edges . the Level controls the brightness of the result and the sli@@ der repetition the strength of the ne@@ on light . in case of large pictures , the filter can load the entire CPU for a moment .
digital cameras often have problems with light conditions and it is therefore not unusual to correct the color contrast and brightness of the photos . you can also experiment with the various color schemes of your photos with the tools in the menu under colors . all your adjustments can be viewed in the preview . once you are satisfied with the result , use the O@@ k button and you will be applied .
if you take a photo in poor lighting conditions , you can get the reverse issue : a too big satur@@ ation . also in this case the tool for brightness / satur@@ ation is a good choice to reduce satur@@ ation instead of raising it . if you like the result you can confirm the changes with O@@ k .
between the complex mould gra@@ dation and the simple lumin@@ osity / contrast / g@@ amma , the tool is located to improve exposure . even if the dialogue with this tool works very complicated , you need only the range of the sli@@ ders described here . more concrete the three sli@@ ders below the hist@@ ogram .
the window contains a graph of intensity values , a hist@@ ogram , the active channel or the selected area . under the graph , three sli@@ ders are cli@@ cked into in and those can be moved to change the intensity values of the image . the left side represents the dark and the right side the bright areas .
the easiest way to learn how to operate it is to shift the controls and to pay attention to how the image changes .
on the right side you can view the original and preview the image . the preview will be updated dynamically based on the settings of the image . on the left , the following options are available .
sc@@ aling : with this selection box can be set whether the hist@@ ogram is represented with a linear or log@@ arith@@ mic Y axis . for images of a digital camera , linear representation is most useful . in images the large areas of a constant color are dominated by a linear hist@@ ogram of a single column . in this case , log@@ arith@@ mic distribution is more useful .
three controls : the top for the dark tones , the middle for the light tones and the lowest for the middle tones , often called g@@ amma values .
the three color pi@@ pet@@ tes can be used in the preview of the original image to automatically adjust the input of shadows , middle and bright tones . furthermore , there is a button for a fully automatic adjustment .
output : the output values allow the selection of manual values for each area . there are also two controllers that can be used to change the output values inter@@ actively as with the input values . for example , the compression of the output value can be used to create a f@@ aded image as background while something else is in the foreground .
automatically : with this button , the image values are automatically set depending on the intensity values of the image .
save as and Load : with these buttons the set values can be saved in the file system and rel@@ o@@ aded later . for this purpose , the Gim@@ p Level format is used .
if you use this mode and the three color pi@@ pet@@ tes , the input value is automatically adjusted for all shadows , means and sun shades . select the color pi@@ p@@ ette you want to use and click on the preview of the original image to set the input values of the history program for red , green , blue and the lumin@@ ance channels .
the option over@@ exposure indicator controls all color channels to find over@@ exposed pixel and show you the combined result of all channels . this is an indicator , i.e. you get the effect only shown in the preview and there is no effect to see the final result .
below you see an example of adjusting the input values applied to the red , green and blue channel of a photo . intensity and alpha channel , as well as the output values are unchanged . the original image is marked with ( 1 ) and the corrected picture with ( 2 ) .
on the left hand side , half of the original and the target image are displayed . the preview will be dynamically updated depending on your settings . on the right , the following options are available :
modi@@ fier channel : this box allows the channel to be specified by the module :
in addition to this box , there are two symbols to switch between a linear and a log@@ arith@@ mic view . for images taken with a digital camera , the linear mode is the most meaningful one . for images with large areas of constant color , linear mode creates a wide beam . in this case , log@@ arith@@ mic mode helps .
for example , if you move a part of the curve to the right , e.g. the bright tones , you can see that these bright tones correspond to darker output tones and that the corresponding pixels become darker .
when you move this marker to the area you want to change , a matching line is displayed on the curve representing the original value . create a point on this line and then move it up and down until the value is adjusted according to your taste .
save as and Load : with these buttons you can do exactly this . each curve you have created can be saved in the file system and loaded later . the file format for this is the Gim@@ p cam format .
when you create this method and the three color pi@@ pet@@ tes automatically create the control points of the curve for all channels of shadow , middle and solar tones . activate the color pi@@ p@@ ette you want to use and click on the original image to set the control points for the red , green , blue and lumin@@ ance curve .
the Over@@ exposure indi@@ k@@ ator option controls all color channels to display over@@ exposed pixel . if pixels are found in more than one channel , you get the combined result . this is an indicator , i.e. you get the effect only shown in the preview and there is no effect to see the final result .
below you can see a black and white photo , which was corrected in the L@@ umin@@ ance channel . shadow and sun shades were set with the color pi@@ p@@ ette and applied to the curves . the original image is ( 1 ) and the corrected ( 2 ) .
the channel mixer of the &amp; digi@@ plug ; image processing is a tool to improve the color channels or change the color gra@@ dations of the photos .
the channel mixer is another advanced tool to mix the colours of the images . you can edit it from the menu Color Channel Mixer of the image processing .
with the channel selection box you can select the color for the hist@@ ogram : this gives you a first indication as to how you can correct the channels by viewing the relative distribution and precip@@ itation . the left area of the window will show you a preview . the original can be viewed for comparison with one &apos;s rider .
the preview of the target image has a red marker . if you position it in the image , a vertical line in the hist@@ ogram appears to show you the corresponding color value .
the controls for the module are right down : controls for red , green and construction allow you to mix these channels . if you activate lumin@@ ance , the image will retain the general brightness as well , as the channel mixer is then THE tool for generating great black @-@ white conver@@ sions of your photos . try to reduce the green channel for black and white portraits .
sometimes , especially if you mix mon@@ och@@ ro@@ me , the reduction of a color leads to a visible noise that comes from the colored . the color @-@ bro@@ w consists of small room art@@ ef@@ acts that do not appear at the same place in the color channel and whose noise pattern in each channel looks different . if that &apos;s the case , you can improve your mon@@ och@@ ro@@ me conversion by doing the color @-@ bro@@ w first .
save as and load buttons are used exactly for this purpose . you can save any mixer settings for later and then load . the file format used is the Gim@@ p channel mixer format .
the option over@@ exposure indicator controls all color channels to find over@@ exposed pixel and show you the combined result of all channels . this is an indicator , i.e. you get the effect only shown in the preview and there is no effect to see the final result .
below you can see a picture in which the blue channel was newly adjusted . the option L@@ umin@@ ance Store is enabled . the original image is under ( 1 ) and the processed image under ( 2 ) to be seen .
black / white photography was always fascinating because of its ability to abstract . with the development of digital photography , black / white is a work step because color images can easily be converted to the computer . also with a set of film roll profiles .

green filter : simul@@ ates a black / white film exposure with a green lens filter . this looks good , with all scene images and fits especially well to portraits against the sky . so similar to the 00@@ 4 C@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) green filter .
orange filter : simul@@ ates a black / white film exposure with orange l@@ enti@@ l filter . this improves landscapes , maritime scenes and aerial photos .
red filter : simul@@ ates a black / white film exposure with a red lens filter . this creates dramatic cel@@ esti@@ al effects and can simulate lun@@ ar scenes at the time of the day . similar to the 00@@ 3 C@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) red filter .
yellow filter : simul@@ ates a black / white film exposure with a yellow lens filter . this is the most natural color correction and improves the contrast . it is ideal for landscapes and therefore similar to 001 C@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) yellow filter .

using the &amp; digi@@ plug ; apply tool texture to apply decorative tex@@ tures to a picture .
by adding a texture to your image , regardless of whether it is a color image or not , you can look it like an oil painting on a canvas , the stit@@ ch of an old master , a pop art portrait made of enlarged points or like a mur@@ al on a wall .
relief : shift this parameter to the right increases the appearance of depth or three @-@ dimension@@ ality of the texture on the picture .
a paper text effect has been applied in the photo below . the original image is ( 1 ) and the changed under ( 2 ) to be seen . the parameter relief has been set to 200 .
with the &amp; digi@@ plug ; tool frame add can be added a decorative frame around a picture .
keeping the eye of a viewer in the limits of a photo is not an easy task . one way to keep his attention is to put the image a decorative frame . this is a psychological barrier for the sc@@ attering eye . under image frame add the module can be started from image processing .
type : with this parameter you set the desired frame type for your picture . throughout , the image bor@@ dered with a colored line , Ni@@ ep@@ ce surrounds it with a thin line and a wide frame ( ideal for black and white pictures ) , be@@ v@@ elled it with a nice three @-@ dimensional frame which is ideal for a button effect and decorative trim adds a decorative frame with patterns .
width : specifies the width of the frame in percent . the range of values for the width is limited from 1 % to 50 % .
the finish image with the frame will be bigger than the original , but have the same aspect ratio . this is important for printing the images , especially if you have used the tool Fol@@ der aspect ratio beforehand .
with this handy tool , you can easily insert a format@@ ted text into an image at any position . this also goes in several places if you need it .
this tool is very intuitive to use . simply enter the text and place it with the mouse . use text direction , orientation , color from the color space and the character set with its properties as you need it . the bigger the image , the greater the character set . finally , simply select a frame around the text and / or a half @-@ transparent background .
each setting you have chosen for your text can be changed until you press the OK button . once the image has been saved , the text is part of the image . it can no longer be changed .
with the &amp; digi@@ plug ; apply tool templates you can place a template over a picture .
the Picture Tem@@ plate menu can be used in image processing can be used to place templates over a picture .
for the sten@@ cil , there are no limitations regarding size and orientation . however , you need to take the P@@ NG file format and should work with maximum compression ( 9 ) to minimize the file size of the template . if you want to add your template to the template , just send an email in English to the &amp; digi@@ plug ; Mail@@ ing@@ list digi@@ plug @-@ users @ k@@ de@@ .org ..
if you use this tool for the first time , you need to set your template folder with the button base folder in the dialog . select the folder in which you have copied the template files . these settings will be noted for the next start .
after the root folder has been set for the sten@@ cils , a tree view appears that reflects the folder structure of the template folder . selecting a folder will automatically update the template of the template .
under the preview are three buttons with which you can change the magni@@ fication factor and the position of your image .
enlarge : this button enlar@@ ges the image below . it is centered around the position of the mouse . please check it with the left mouse button .
smaller : this button reduces the image underneath . it is centered around the position of the mouse . if you want to apply the template to the full picture , you need to reduce the image accordingly . please check it with the left mouse button .
post@@ p@@ one : use this button to move the image lying under the template . take the image and place it on the desired position .
use OK if you want to apply the template to your image . the image will then be adjusted automatically to the preview size .
&amp; digi@@ plug ; provides three different tools for sharpen@@ ing . each of you has advantages in other areas .
sharpen@@ ing is a traditional tool for sharpen@@ ing . it is very fast and easy , but it generates , especially in dark areas , gra@@ iny images .
blur@@ ring mask works on the contrast of edges to make a picture shar@@ per . actually , it sharp@@ ens not a bit , it works rather psych@@ ologically . you can use it to remove atmospheric vap@@ or and it makes a really good job . the algorithm was taken from Gim@@ p and it is protected by W@@ inst@@ on Ch@@ ang .
re@@ focusing is perhaps the best of the three , since it really improves the sharp@@ ness . it is a little more complicated in its application and has different parameters to adjust .
photos without focus as well as most digit@@ alized images require a correction of the sharp@@ ness . this is because the digi@@ tization process colors must be combined with only minimal differences to one color point . this in turn results in sharp edges a little blur@@ red . the same phenomenon can be observed when color points are printed on paper . S@@ LR cameras usually require more later sharpen@@ ing than normal cameras for private users .
in JPEG pictures , a camera is often used for internal sharpen@@ ing . images in the raw format , on the other hand , must always be sharpen@@ ed during processing .
some scann@@ ers use a field of sharp@@ ness during the image of the image . if you de@@ activate it , you will get control over your image .
in some situations you can get useful results by sharpen@@ ing a photo with sharpen@@ ing ke@@ yp@@ ad . you can use the menu entry Cor@@ rec@@ ting Do@@ ing .
you should handle this with caution because the results do not work very naturally : sharpen@@ ing increases the sharp@@ ness of the edges , but also ampli@@ fies the noise . in general , the most useful technique for sharpen@@ ing a picture is re@@ focusing . you can re@@ focus it via the menu entry Cor@@ rec@@ t . under re@@ focuss@@ ing you will find more information and a comparison of all techniques for sharpen@@ ing .
sometimes you have the opposite problem : a picture is too cr@@ un@@ chy . the solution to draw the picture a little bit soft is much easier than sharpen@@ ing it . use the tool to sof@@ ten the image with the menu entry Cor@@ rec@@ t sof@@ tly and experiment with settings . the preview window on the right side of the dialog will show you the effect on your photo .
the Filter In@@ sharp mas@@ king is a very good tool to remove veil from your photos . you can see a demonstration here .
the original image and preview help to edit the image . the preview window shows the output of the filter with the current settings .
there are two important parameters , the radius and the amount . the default values often produce good results and should be tested first . an increase of the radius or amount increase the effect . if you make the blur@@ ring mask too strong , noise and impression of gr@@ ates in the vicinity of sharp edges generate .
the radius represents how many pixels on each side of an edge are affected by the filter . high @-@ resolution images allow larger radi@@ i . therefore , you should shar@@ pen images best in their final resolution .
the amount represents the percentage between the original and the blur@@ red image that is added to the original . thus the strength of the sharp@@ ness is set .
the threshold value is a fraction of the maximum RGB value and the applied difference amount . thus , one can define a minimum difference to be applied for an edge of the filter . thus , areas with a soft change between the tones are excluded from shar@@ pen and therefore plastic f@@ laws in faces , skies and water surfaces are avoided .
this is an example of the blur@@ red mask filter . the original image is the ( 1 ) and the processed image the ( 2 ) . un@@ sharp mas@@ king was applied with radius = 6.0 , amount = 0.5 and a threshold value = 0.0 .
the &amp; digi@@ plug ; tool re@@ focuss@@ ing re@@ focused an image by improving the sharp@@ ness . it used the copy@@ righ@@ ted filtering algorithm of Ernst Li@@ ppe .
this tool tries to capture a picture &amp; quot ; re@@ focusing quot ; in which it revers@@ es the de@@ focusing . it uses a technique called FI@@ R Wiener Fil@@ tr@@ ation . the traditional technique for sharpen@@ ing images is the use of a blur@@ ring mask . re@@ focus usually reaches better results than blur@@ red . you can start it from the menu by re@@ focusing colors in image processing .
the G@@ auss &apos;s folding has a very long tail , which causes the mathematical result also from the source pix@@ les that are far from the original source pixels . in most cases the FI@@ R Vienna in@@ verse of the palate is influenced very strongly from the distant pixels , causing un@@ desirable results .
circular sharp@@ ness : this is the radius of the circular folding . it is the most important parameter for using this module . for most pictures , the default value should give 1 good results . you can set a higher value if your image is blur@@ red , but then pay attention to hal@@ o notes .
correlation : an increase in correlation can help reduce arti@@ facts . the correlation can be chosen from 0 @-@ 1 . useful values are 0.5 and the values are near 1 , &amp; eg ; 0.@@ 95 and 0.@@ 99 . a high value for correlation lowers the sharp@@ est effect of the module .
noise filter : an increase in noise filter can help you to reduce arti@@ facts . however , values higher than 0.1 are rarely useful . if the noise filter is too low , &amp; eg ; 0 the image quality is very poor . a useful value is 0.@@ 03 . a high value will even further s@@ me@@ ar the image .
G@@ auss &apos;s sharp@@ ness : this is the radius for the g@@ auss sharp@@ ness . use this parameter if your blur@@ ring is Gau@@ Ã . this is most often caused by a previously executed blur@@ ring filter . in most cases , you should use this value to 0 to avoid annoying art@@ ef@@ acts . if you use a value non@@ zero otherwise you may also increase the correlation and / or the noise filter .
die size : this value determines the size of the transformation matrix . an increase in the size of the die can produce good results , especially if you select large values for the circular sharp@@ ness or g@@ auss &apos; edge . however , note that the module will be very slow if you select large values for this parameter . in most cases , you should select a value in the range from 3 @-@ 10 .
save as and load buttons are used exactly for this purpose . any re@@ focusing parameter you have set will be saved for later and can then be loaded .
try to perform all trimm@@ ing , color and intensity corrections on the image before using the module .
otherwise , you should use the module before you change the image otherwise . the reason for this is that much operations changes which are not immediately visible , but later leave unpleasant art@@ ef@@ acts .
if you read and comp@@ ress images , eg ; as JPEG , you should apply the module to the un@@ compressed picture .
generally , unclear mas@@ king produces better results than sharpen@@ ing . this could be caused by sharpen@@ ing the unclear mas@@ king a larger neighborhood than sharpen@@ ing .
even under optimal conditions it can never remove the effect of blur@@ ring . for the Vienna filter it is possible to show that it is the optimal Line@@ ar Filter . practically , the result of the FI@@ R Wiener Fil@@ ters is always at least as good as the blur@@ ring mask . the FI@@ R Wiener Filter is often better for processing small details .
below you can see a comparison between the different filters on a small un@@ focused image :
the original un@@ sharp color picture must be corrected . this picture has been made with an analog camera . the un@@ focused result is due to insufficient light for the auto focus lens .
for more information about the methods of sharp@@ ness correction in digital images , you can read a technical comparison in English under this address .
the sli@@ der smoo@@ thes the bl@@ ur of the area that has been dark@@ ened in order to create a more natural pup@@ il .
the color tin@@ te allows an adapted color for the pup@@ il . if you want blue eyes instead of dark , then you can adjust this here .
the image error correction tool is one of the most advanced tools for removing unwanted arti@@ facts with unprecedented speed .
the painting algorithm was developed by the I@@ MA@@ GE team of the G@@ REC CN@@ RS laboratories in Ca@@ en / France and is part of the C@@ Im@@ g project .
this tool includes various pres@@ ets as starting points to simplify the restoration . the available pres@@ ets are listed below :
if you want to fin@@ alize the filter settings , you can use the tab smoo@@ thing and advanced settings .
detail conservation p &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this controls the preservation of the details . a small value leads to uniform smoo@@ thing over the image . whereas larger values mainly smooth homogen@@ ous regions and give details sharp . a value of 0.@@ 9 should be kept in such a way that no sharpen@@ ing is necessary .
directional depend@@ ability Alpha &#91; 0,@@ 100 &#93; : a small value smoo@@ thes evenly in all directions , while a value is smoo@@ thed to 1 only in one direction . if you have a film gran@@ ulation or CCD noise will produce a high value sha@@ ggy patterns .
smoo@@ thing &#91; 0 , 500 &#93; : this sets the maximum smoo@@ thing factor above all@@ . p then defines the relative smoo@@ thing . therefore , set this value matching the degree of noise in your image .
regul@@ arity : &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this parameter concerns larger structures . the higher this value is set , the more it is smoo@@ thed . this is necessary when very much noise is present , as it is then difficult to estimate the geometry of the image . even if you want to create a &apos; van Go@@ gh &apos; Tur@@ bul@@ ence effect , it must be set higher than 3 .
repeti@@ tions : specifies how often the algorithm is going through . normally , 1 or 2 is sufficient .
angle @-@ wide angle &#91; 5 , 90 &#93; : angle dependent integration of an@@ is@@ otrop@@ ic alpha . if alpha is selected small , it should also be small . make sure that small angles yield a long run@@ time . thus , you should choose this value as much as possible and acceptable for your needs .
integral step width &#91; 0,1 , 10 &#93; : integral step width in pixels . you should set the value smaller 1 to avoid sub @-@ pixel smoo@@ thing and never exceed 2 .
we recommend linear inter@@ pol@@ ation : the more quality you receive by selecting this option is only small , but it doubles the run@@ time . we therefore recommend it to be om@@ itted .
the buttons save as and load do exactly this . each setting of image errors can be corrected in a text file and loaded later .
correct image errors is relatively quick at work . however , it can take a very long time and pull a high CPU load . you can therefore cancel the calculation at any time using the Ab@@ ort button .
below you can see how picture errors can be corrected with Small arti@@ facts . the module is applied on a photo that was made in Guatemala City using an analog camera . as you can see , there is a unique black art@@ ef@@ act in the foreground that was caused by a poor film storage during the trip .
the &amp; digi@@ plug ; noise reduction is a very powerful tool to reduce noise . it uses a copy@@ righ@@ ted algorithm by Peter Heck@@ ert .
this tool provides selectable image filters to remove stain@@ s and other art@@ ef@@ acts , e.g. from dust or hair on the lens . it can also be used to remove sensor noise from camera or Mo@@ i@@ re@@ acute ; effects of scanned images from books or magazines .
if you need more information about sensor noise from digital cameras , you can read it in English in this tutorial .
the screen@@ shot above shows a typical scene made with a digital camera and a high ISO sensitivity . it shows a gran@@ ular noise that can be successfully removed with this tool .
the following is a complete description of all parameters . in most cases , you only need the sub@@ window Details and the Advanced Settings window can remain with default settings .
radius controls the window size , from 1 ( 3@@ x@@ 3 ) to 20 ( 4@@ 1@@ x@@ 41 ) , which is used for the filter . large values increase the time the filter is needed per pixel and can wipe the image . the area indicated by the radius moves over the image and the color in it is smoo@@ thed and thus minor errors are adjusted .
sharp@@ ness : controls the sharp@@ ness level . this value sets the pixel pitch to the front of the filter to determine lumin@@ ance changes . if it is increased , noise levels will be deleted . if the value is too high , the adaptive filter image details can no longer be maintained and noise or lubrication occurs again .
edges : check the edge accuracy for the sharp@@ ness . this value improves the frequency response of the filter . if it is too strong , the entire noise can not be removed or noise peaks can occur . set it to a value near the maximum if you want to remove a weak noise or JPEG @-@ arti@@ facts without losing any details .
lumin@@ ance : controls the lumin@@ ance tolerance of the image . we recommend changing either color or lumin@@ ance to improve an image . these settings do not affect the smoo@@ th@@ ness process that is controlled by the details pane .
color : controls the color tolerance of the image . we recommend changing color or lumin@@ ance to improve an image . these settings do not affect the smoo@@ th@@ ness process that is controlled by the details pane .
g@@ amma : controls the g@@ amma tolerance of the image . this value can be used to increase the tolerance values of the darker areas that are typically rough@@ ed more strongly . however , it also gre@@ ases the shadow areas .
d@@ amping : controls the adjustment of the phase j@@ itter d@@ amping . this value defines how fast the adaptive filter radius responds to variations of lumin@@ ance . if it is elevated , the edges appear smo@@ other when it is too high a s@@ me@@ aring can occur .
save under and load : these buttons are used exactly for this . all the noise reduction parameters you have set can be saved to the file system and loaded later .
this is an example of how noise reduction can change your life . the original image is marked with ( 1 ) and the corrected with ( 2 ) . the noise reduction was applied using the default settings .
the solution to draw the picture a little bit soft is fortunately much easier than a picture to shar@@ pen . use the tool to sof@@ ten the image with the menu entry Cor@@ rec@@ t sof@@ tly and experiment with the smoo@@ thing . the preview window on the right side of the dialog shows the effect of this operation on your photo .
the &amp; digi@@ plug ; photo restoration is definitely one of the most advanced tools to reduce photo arti@@ facts .
this restoration filter gives you the possibility to remove a lot of unwanted art@@ ef@@ acts from your images . it is very well adapted to remove Gau@@ Ã &apos;s noise , film gran@@ ulation , scratches , compression arti@@ facts and local errors that appear in digital , original or subsequently digit@@ alized images .
the algorithm for restoration has been developed by the I@@ MA@@ GE team of the G@@ REC CN@@ RS laboratories in Ca@@ en / Fran@@ n@@ k@@ reich and is part of the C@@ Im@@ g project .
JPEG arti@@ facts reduce : compression of JPEG is not perfect , in some areas even very far away . as a los@@ sy compression algorithm , it generates some compression &amp; quot ; art@@ ef@@ acts quot ; - small standards that can be seen in the un@@ compressed picture . this setting should correct these problems .
the buttons save as and load do exactly this . each setting of photo restoration can be saved into a text file and loaded later .
photo Rest@@ oration is comparatively very fast at work . it can still take a long time and pull a high CPU load . you can therefore cancel the calculation at any time using the button Be@@ aches .
the module is applied to a black and white photo that with a min@@ ol@@ ta ( t@@ m ) HP @-@ 5 movie was recorded onto an Il@@ ford ( t@@ m ) HP @-@ 5 movie with a sensitivity of 3@@ 200 ISO . you can see the not@@ orious film grain on the faces . the original image is under ( 1 ) and the corrected below ( 2 ) .
below you can see another example of photo restoration . this time , tex@@ tures were applied to an old color photograph , which was read with a scanner . you can see the scan art@@ ef@@ acts caused by the scanner lighting and the photo paper . the original image is under ( 1 ) to see and the corrected picture under ( 2 ) .
it uses algorithms from the J@@ PE@@ G@@ Pi@@ xi project protected by Martin Dick@@ opp . it uses algorithms from the J@@ PE@@ G@@ Pi@@ xi project protected by copyright by Martin Dick@@ opp .
bright , dead or hot pixels are a problem especially for high @-@ quality raw mode photos , as many cameras with JPEG compression have a built @-@ in suppression for hot pixels .
this tool can be used to remove &amp; quot ; hot Pix@@ el@@ quot ; and &quot; quot ; bright Pix@@ el@@ quot ; on a photo with a dark image sub@@ traction method . there is currently no manual method to select the bad pixels .
download this file in the wizard with the button dark image . the tool will automatically detect the hot and light pixels . these will be highlighted in the image preview .
if you have an old digital camera it is important that you record the dark image directly in order to detect new hot or light pixels by CCD faults .
first , as described in the previous section , you should load the matching dark image to the image to be corrected . an automatic processing of the dark image will find the bad pixels . note that the wizard will notice the last dark image and will load it again in the next session .
the image area and preview help you to correct the result within the image . the preview window shows the output of the filter with the current settings . bad pixels are raised in all preview areas .
select an area to view the defective pixels on the preview and the results of the filter . then select the best filter method to inter@@ pol@@ ate these pixel blocks . these are the filters available :
average : an average of the adjacent pixels is determined . the resulting color is assigned to all faulty pixels in the block . for a 1 @-@ dimensional inter@@ pol@@ ation , this is made separately for the horizontal and vertical line .
linear : all pixels that have a distance of 1 from pixel block are drawn up for the calculation of a bi @-@ linear surface ( 2 dim ) or a group of linear curves ( 1 @-@ dim ) . these are then used to inter@@ pol@@ ate the defective pixels in the block .
square : this is the default fil@@ ter@@ method . all pixels with a distance of 2 or less to pixel block are drawn to calculate a bi @-@ square surface ( 2 dim ) or a group of square curves ( 1 @-@ dim ) that is then used to inter@@ pol@@ ate the pixels in the block .
cubic : all pixels with a distance of 3 or less are drawn to calculate a bi @-@ cubic surface ( 2 dim ) or a group of cubic curves ( 1 @-@ dim ) used to inter@@ pol@@ ate the defective pixels in the block .
below you can see the Hot@@ pixel correction on a color photograph , from a defective digital camera with a sensitivity of 200 ISO and long exposure . the original image has been enlarged to 300 % ( 1 ) and the corrected picture can be seen below ( 2 ) .
die &amp; digi@@ kam ; Vig@@ net@@ ting correction is a tool to correct the vig@@ net@@ ting , i.e. under@@ exposed corners , of an image .
wide angle lenses , especially those in medium and large photo format , can often not illumin@@ ate the entire sensor range evenly . instead &amp; quot ; vig@@ net@@ ting ag@@ ility ; ( sh@@ aded ) they reduce the corners and edges of the image by reaching the light that reaches the sensor there .
many center filters need a factor of 1.5 or 2 while the ir@@ is filter , which makes it impossible to keep the camera with the hand . wide angle lenses should also be used with center filters , an aperture of f / 16 or smaller , otherwise blur@@ ring effects are caused by motion .
with the large exposure areas of today &apos;s film and colour and gra@@ y@@ scale depth of digital cameras and film scann@@ ers , it is possible to simulate the effect of a center filter by applying an equivalent transformation on a raw image that was made without this filter . the tool Vig@@ net@@ ting Cor@@ rection applies the transformation with a center filter to an image . the algorithm is protected by copyright by John Walker .
with three controls you can check the Vig@@ net@@ ting Cor@@ rection filter and three further expos@@ ures of the target image .
density : this parameter controls the degree of light intensity absorption at the point of the greatest density of the filter . the standard density is 2.0 , which allows an optical filter with an aperture setting of 1 , or accidentally a light intensity of 2 . increase the density to compensate for a greater degree of vig@@ net@@ ting , reduce it by a small degree to compensate .
lumin@@ osity , Con@@ trast , and G@@ amma Settings : editing an image with the vig@@ net@@ ting correction reduces the brightness of the pixels . you need to adjust the exposure of the target image with these options . the controls only provide positive values , since you only have to increase the settings .
if you want a fin@@ er read@@ just@@ ment of exposure of the target image , leave the values for brightness / contrast / g@@ amma at zero and use the gra@@ dation from the &amp; digi@@ cam ; image processing from the Color Gra@@ dation menu .
this is an example of the correction of vig@@ net@@ ting on one image . the original image ( 1 ) shows the vig@@ net@@ ting in the corners and ( 2 ) the corrected picture . a den@@ ial and contrast correction was also performed in the picture using this tool .
the &amp; digi@@ plug ; lens distortion is a tool to correct the impact of spher@@ ical lenses on photos . it uses a copy@@ righ@@ ted algorithm by David Ho@@ dson .
this tool works with geometric distor@@ tions . colour distor@@ tions cannot be corrected using this tool .
the coefficient of the second degree deals with the general geometric distortion of the lens and can correct the conc@@ ave or con@@ ve@@ x form of the image .
the coefficient of the third degree has a similar ro@@ unding effect , but fl@@ atten@@ s at the edges . this correction is not applied in the tool .
the coefficient fourth gra@@ des correc@@ ts the remote corners to that of the second degree . if you combine these two , any geometric distortion can be almost eliminated .
in general , this value controls the strength of distortion second degrees . with negative values tone @-@ shaped distor@@ tions can be corrected and positive values cushion distortion .
corner : this value controls the thickness of the distortion fourth . this value acts more strongly on the edges than in the middle of the image . for most lenses , the &apos; corners parameter has the opposite sign of the parameter in general .
zoom : this value res@@ umes the image size and thus leads to a correction of the first degree . negative values increase while positive the image decreases .
bright : this value adjust@@ s brightness in the corners of the image . negative values decrease the brightness of the image in the corners while positive values increase it .
to help you find the best filter settings , the dialog with a preview illustrates the distortion correction . the values you use for your image are saved and used at the next start as default values .
the ton@@ ne or cushion correction should be performed before all trimm@@ ing or size changes . best perform this correction as all of the first . if you have to cut a picture again and then perform a ton@@ ical correction , the effect would obviously be the wrong .
to help you find the best correction , this tool provides you with a vertical and a horizontal guide line . move it to an important location , such as the edge of the sea or a building wall , in your image and press the left mouse button to fix the lines at this point . subsequently , you can correct the ton@@ ne / cushion distortion with the help of the lines .
if you correct a cushion @-@ like distortion , the resulting image will have black corners . you can remove them using the trimm@@ ing tool in the menu Trans@@ forming random from image editing or via the zoom knob of this dialog .
the next logical step for some motifs such as photos from the front , frames and paintings is to correct the perspective so that all angles in the picture have 90 degrees . note that if you hold the camera with your hand you will always have a slight distortion of the perspective .
this is an example of the spher@@ ical correction applied to a church in Norway . the original image is under ( 1 ) and the corrected picture under ( 2 ) to be seen .
the algorithm is based on a method for simul@@ ating inf@@ ra @-@ red film of the G@@ imp@@ enb@@ u.@@ org website which is accessible under this URL . the filter re@@ produces the well @-@ known Il@@ ford ( t@@ m ) S@@ F@@ X@@ 200 I@@ inf@@ rar@@ ot@@ ape , see this URL . this film has a sensitivity range of 200 @-@ 800 ISO .
in the left side of the window , you can select the area for the preview . if you move the red rect@@ angle with the mouse , you can view the effect on different parts of the image .
below the preview you can set two parameters of film gran@@ ulation and film sensitivity ( ISO ) . add the option Add film gran@@ ulation if you want to simulate the gra@@ iny texture of a highly sensitive film . the ISO controller changes the amount of film gran@@ ulation and the domin@@ ance of color green ( chlor@@ ophy@@ ll in nature ) in transformation . green meadows become white like snow !
as the filter mixes color channels to reproduce infrared film , especially the green channel does not make sense to apply the effect on black / white photos as the color information is missing .
this is an example of the inf@@ ra @-@ red filter applied to a landscape photo of New Zealand . the original image is under ( 1 ) and the processed image under ( 2 ) to be seen . the sensitivity of the film was set to ISO 400 . higher ISO values create a kind of aura in the top lights .
the &amp; digi@@ plug ; filter film gran@@ ulation is an easy @-@ to @-@ use tool to reproduce film gran@@ ulation on your images . this is known from classic high @-@ speed films such as the B / W Ko@@ da@@ k Tr@@ i @-@ X . to increase the sensitivity of the movies the manufacturers blend large silver grains of photo emul@@ sion .
the film gra@@ ding effect gives your photo a certain mood or seems to move back into the past . the treated image gets rid of a timeless atmosphere detached from everyday life . if you want this special , gallery @-@ like , street @-@ photographic , gran@@ ular view specially in your mon@@ och@@ ro@@ me photos , you must use this filter .
with the regulator , the ISO sensitivity can be calibr@@ ated to control the intensity and gran@@ ul@@ arity of the grains . the default value is , although often higher values are required , are set to ISO @-@ 24@@ 00 . if you need even more grains , you can use the filter several times .
this is an example of the film grain effect applied to a black / white image . the original image is the ( 1 ) and that worked the ( 2 ) . the film sensitivity used corresponds to ISO @-@ 1600 .
the &amp; digi@@ plug ; filter oil painting creates the appearance of an oil painting . it uses a copyright protected algorithm of Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
the &amp; digi@@ plug ; filter oil painting gives your digital images a nice appearance like an oil painting . nature pictures and still life are good for this effect .
there are two kno@@ bs to influence this effect . the upper one sel@@ ects the brush size between one and five . thicker brush is better suited for large images . smoo@@ thing controls the smoo@@ th@@ ness or , from the other side , the focus .
this is an example of the oil painting effect . the original picture is marked with the ( 1 ) and the processing is marked with the ( 2 ) . pin size for this 6@@ 40 pixel wide picture is 1 and fl@@ atten 17 .
the &amp; digi@@ plug ; Filter coal drawing uses color and intensity gra@@ dients to create a coal sket@@ ch . images whose gra@@ dients vary slowly therefore are not ideal for this effect . it is helpful if you imagine which scene you would have chosen to sket@@ ch for you . this would be good pictures to start with .
there are two controllers with a range of values from 1 to 100 to control this effect . the upper knob sel@@ ects the pen size and the lower adjust@@ s the contrast ( smooth ) .
this is an example of the coal drawing filter . the original image ( 1 ) and the modified image ( 2 ) . the default settings of 30 and 10 have been used . the result can be further improved by adjusting the intensity value .
the &amp; digi@@ plug ; filter engraving shapes your image in 3 @-@ D as if it was stamped in wax . it uses a copy@@ righ@@ ted algorithm of Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
the &amp; digi@@ plug ; filter engraving is a fast tool to recre@@ ate your images with a 3 @-@ D effect . it works especially well with images with a simple structure where color is not the most important thing . the filter uses the differences between color and intensity to transform the image into a gray , mon@@ op@@ ic landscape .
depth allows to adjust the contrast of the filter . a value of 30 , corresponds to 10 % , is the default setting .
this is an example of the engraving filter . the original ( 1 ) and the edited image ( 2 ) . the used depth is 10 % .
with this filtering group you can transform a normal photograph into a work of art using distortion effects . it uses protected algorithms from Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
shaft blocks 1 : divide the image into cells and let it look as if it is seen through glass blocks .
shaft blocks 2 : an@@ alog@@ ous to the wave blocks 1 the picture is distorted with a different version of glass blocks .
some effects require long time to calculate and produce a high CPU load . you can cancel these effects at any time using the button Be@@ aches .
with this filter group you can transform a normal photo into a work of art using blur@@ ring effects . it uses protected algorithms from Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
zoom In@@ shar@@ per : blur@@ red the image along star lines that eman@@ ate from one focal point . this simul@@ ates blur@@ ring a zo@@ oming camera and thus creates a dynamic expression that is often seen in sports photography .
radi@@ al bl@@ ur : blur@@ ring the image by turning the pixels around a center . this simul@@ ates the blur@@ ring of a rotating camera .
distance blur@@ ring : blur@@ red the image to create the effect of a non @-@ focused camera lens . the object appears to step back into the background .
blur@@ ring : blur@@ ring the image through horizontal movements of the pixels . this simul@@ ates the blur@@ ring of a linear moving , z : B : from a car or train , camera .
sof@@ tly bl@@ ur : blur@@ red the image sof@@ tly in the dark and strong in the bright tones . this creates photos with a dre@@ amy and shiny soft focus effect ( Hamilton Eff@@ ect ) . this is ideal for creating romantic portraits , glam@@ our photos or adding a warm and subtle glow .
shaking Bl@@ ur : wi@@ pes the image by random@@ ly shifting the pixels and simul@@ ates the blur@@ ring of an arbitrary moving camera .
intelligent bl@@ ur : finds the color font in the picture and wi@@ pes it without changing the rest .
mos@@ aic : spl@@ its the photo into rectangular cells and then recre@@ ates it by filling with an average pixel value .
some effects require long time to calculate and cause a high CPU load . you can therefore cancel this calculation at any time using the button Be@@ aches .
the ra@@ ind@@ rops are a nice little tool to make ra@@ ind@@ rops on your image . this gives it natural to your pictures a wet look . it uses one of Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n copy@@ righ@@ ted algorithm .
drop size allows to change the size of the drops . as the drop size does not grow automatically with the size of the image it is often necessary to decrease the size for small images . number changes the number and density of drops . fish eyes change the optical effect of drops on the image .
you can choose with the &amp; digi@@ plug ; image processing an area free of ra@@ ind@@ rops . use the selection tool to select the area , e.g. a face that should remain free . if you then start the filter reg@@ ent@@ ro@@ pfen , the area will remain free of ra@@ ind@@ rops .
this is an example of the reg@@ ent@@ ro@@ p filter . the original image ( 1 ) shows a calm sunset and the processed image ( 2 ) indicates a sunset after a storm . the default values were used for this example .
if the photo has the wrong orientation , you can put it in the right direction by mirr@@ oring or rotating . you can find the tools in the menu Trans@@ forming Rot@@ ating or Trans@@ forming Spi@@ kes .
photo bubbles is definitely one of the most advanced tools to enlarge a photo with a minimal loss of image quality .
the big question is how you can infl@@ ate a picture and keep the details sharp ? how can you zoom in an image when the limits of resolution are reached ? how can you recover the missing information again ? the C@@ im@@ g algorithm used here makes a good job . try it and you will see it yourself .
if a photo has the wrong size , you can scale it to the desired size with the tool size . select to change size change in the menu and specify the target values . the dialog is shown below .
the size of the tool uses a linear inter@@ pol@@ ation method to approximate the pixels . if you want to enlarge a small picture with a better quality , try the tool for blowing .
many image processing programs use a kind of inter@@ pol@@ ation , e.g. sp@@ line inter@@ pol@@ ation to enlarge an image . &amp; digi@@ plug ; uses a further developed approach . the underlying algorithm photo bubbles was developed by the I@@ MA@@ GE team of the G@@ REC CN@@ RS laboratories in Ca@@ en / France and is part of the C@@ Im@@ g project .
you need to tell the tool how to change the size . these settings are available in the New Size tab and are listed below :
maintain aspect ratio : if this setting is enabled , the aspect ratio of the original image will be retained when entering the new size .
regul@@ arity : &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this parameter concerns larger structures . the higher this value is set , the more it is smoo@@ thed . this is necessary when very much noise is present , as it is then difficult to estimate the geometry of the image . even if you want to create a &apos; van Go@@ gh &apos; Tur@@ bul@@ ence effect , it must be set higher than 3 .
the buttons Save as and Load are used exactly for this . each st@@ aging for photo enlarge can be saved as a text file and loaded later .
photo bubbles are very fast at what it does , but it can take a long time and pull a high CPU load . you can cancel the calculation at any time using the button Be@@ aches .
you can see below an example for photo bubbles when a small color image has been enlarged to double size . the original is ( 1 ) and the enlarged picture ( 3 ) . the preview ( 2 ) is the result of linear standard enlargement for comparison .
cutting a photo is not only a frequently performed operation , but also a frequently under@@ estimated tool to put together a picture . to cut a photo you simply have to create with the mouse only the rect@@ angle with the mouse , by pressing the mouse button and drawing the rect@@ angle , you will see this rect@@ angle then while you move the mouse .
when you release the mouse button again , the area of the photo is cut off . thus you get a good overview of how your photo would look after cutting . you can change the size of the area to be slic@@ ed by dra@@ gging on the corners of the rect@@ angle .
once you are satisfied with the cutting , use the button The trimm@@ ing button of the image processing in the toolbar and the photo will be cut ( C@@ trl ; + X ) .
in the preview pane you can change the size of the rect@@ angle by moving the corners with the mouse . the aspect ratio that you have defined in the dialog will be preserved .
in the tool Fol@@ der aspect ratio , you can specify the orientation as portrait or landscape format . in portrait format , the greater value of the height and in the cross @-@ format of the width is assigned .
the tool Fol@@ ding aspect ratio uses a relative aspect ratio . this means that it is always the same regardless of whether you use centimet@@ ers , inches or any other physical size . you can , for example , see below a list of traditional sizes for photo paper and its aspect ratio .
at the right end of the dialog there are two buttons to automatically center the selection horizontally or vertically .
at the bottom of the dialog you can set the range for trimm@@ ing to the maximum possible , depending on the chosen ratio and orientation .
the tool Fol@@ der aspect ratio cuts its settings depending on the image orientation ( horizontal or vertical ) . if you use the trimm@@ ing tool next time , these settings will be displayed as default values depending on the orientation . the changed image dimensions are saved in the EX@@ IF tables , so that EX@@ IF data reflect the cut image and not the original image .
the settings of the integration help make it possible to fade in help , so that you can put your pictures together better . these aids are :
harmonic triangle : harmonic divi@@ des are based on the principle of simil@@ arity . like the Third el@@ bows , harmonious tri@@ angles are a possibility to divide a rect@@ angle in a similar harmonic tri@@ angles on the diagonal .
golden center : the golden center is a division that affects various natural growth patterns like the spiral of a Nau@@ til@@ us shell or the leaves of a sun@@ flower . it appears in all sorts of things we feel as beautiful .
the golden division is the irr@@ ational number 1,@@ 6@@ 180@@ 33@@ 9@@ 88 ... and it was used already by the ancient Egyptians and Greeks who constructed your temples and pyrami@@ ds . artists and architects used the golden division in all times when you put together your pictures , buildings and even photos to give your creations a natural order and beauty .
the number deri@@ ves from the Fi@@ bon@@ acc@@ i sequence 1 , 1 , 2 , 3 , 5 , 8 , 13 , 21 , 34 &amp; etc . , where any number after 1 is equal to the sum of their two previous numbers . the resulting divi@@ der is 1 : 1.@@ 6@@ 18 the golden center . a composition that follows this rule is considered visually harmonious .
the golden center provides more liquid support lines when you put together an image . these aids are listed below :
the Golden Spirit will bring you good results for your photos to achieve your goal . compared to the third rule , the golden spiral produces a liquid line that can follow the eye through the image . this type of composition guides the observer &apos;s gaze along the line of the spiral and creates a symmet@@ ric visual river on this way .
a further rule is the rec@@ tan@@ gles of the golden spiral , also called golden rec@@ tan@@ gles . this rec@@ tan@@ gles are used to create the golden spiral . it should give something that the eye falls into the centre of the composition . this can be a line or different objects .
the Golden Tri@@ angles are also derived from the Golden Spir@@ als discussed above . their verti@@ ces are the central points of the sides of the golden rec@@ tan@@ gles . note that in contrast to harmonious tri@@ angles , golden tri@@ angles are no equal tri@@ angles . diag@@ on@@ als can be placed on these lines a static object can be released more dynamically .
if you use golden tri@@ angles to break your frame , you create an effect called dynamic symmet@@ ry by professional photographers . try to place your focus on one of the intersection points and other visual information in the tri@@ angles . the result is a very attractive composition that you cannot reach otherwise .
the options Horizon@@ tal mirror and vertical mirror can be used to mirror the harmonic divisions .
with the button color you can set the color of the auxiliary lines . if you have an image with many colors and a high contrast , the auxiliary lines can be invisible . in this way , you can adjust the color of the lines to your current image .
the free rotation is a tool to rotate an image at any angle .
if you take a photo then it happens easily that you do not hold the camera exactly vertical or horizontally . this creates a picture in which things are rot@@ ated around an angle . you can do this with the &amp; digi@@ plug ; image processing and the tool free rotation . select Trans@@ forming Free Rotation and adjust the target angle .
rotate your image with the sli@@ der angle . the values on this slide are indicated in degrees . with the button Pre@@ ferences , you can set the slide back to 0 degrees . a preview of the rotation is available on the right side of the window . the new dimensions of the image are shown on the top right .
for your help , the free rotation module provides a horizontal and a vertical line . move the mouse poin@@ ter in the image preview to position the two lines . after moving it over an important point of the image , you can fix it with a pressure on the left mouse button . now adjust the angle as described in previous section .
after turning a picture you will find unwanted tri@@ angular holes in the corners . a way to fix this is to use the function Trans@@ forming Rand@@ om from image processing .
an elegant way to cut the image is automatic cutting . choose one of the following options :
the anti @-@ ali@@ asing option smoo@@ thes the image a little bit after the turn . note however the above warning .
all perspective trans@@ formations are performed by a fixed point to the so @-@ called reference point . this point is in the middle of the image and is represented by a red circle .
to change the perspective , you need to use the red squares on the corners of your image . the preview is then automatically rec@@ al@@ cul@@ ated . on the right side of the dialog you will find some information that will help you to change the perspective :
new width : shows the width of the new image , including empty areas created by the transformation , in pixels .
new height : shows the height of the new image , including empty areas created by the transformation , in pixels .
angles at the top left : shows the current angle in degrees at the upper left corner of the trans@@ formed area .
corner right above : displays the current angle in degrees at the upper right corner of the trans@@ formed area .
angle at the left : shows the current angle in degrees at the lower left corner of the trans@@ formed area .
angle to the right : displays the current angle in degrees at the lower right corner of the trans@@ formed area .
after adjusting the perspective , the image becomes a little bit gre@@ ased . for a single adjustment this effect is small but two adap@@ tations generate a double so strong effect and you should avoid this if possible .
after you have adjusted the perspective , you get un@@ happy tri@@ angular holes in the corners . one way to clean this is to cut the image with trans@@ form@@ able cutting from the image processing .
the tool is used to move a part of the image in one direction and move the other part into the opposite direction . this is not a rotation , the image is distorted . in other words , a right angle is turned into a parall@@ el@@ ogram . you can start this module via Trans@@ forming scissors .
scissors can be positioned horizontally and vertically at the same time . if you press pres@@ ets , the angles are reset to zero . a preview of the effect will be displayed to you and the new dimensions of the target image will be displayed to the right of the preview pane .
to your help are displayed a vertical and a horizontal line . move the mouse to an important point , such as the lake , a wall from a building on your image and press the left mouse button to fix the lines . you can now use the tool to adjust your image .
after you have done the sc@@ aling , the image becomes a bit blur@@ red . for a single sh@@ ear@@ ing this effect is mostly neg@@ li@@ gible , but two z@@ ations produce twice as much blur@@ ring and therefore you should avoid this .
after sh@@ ear@@ ing , the picture has some nice tri@@ angular holes in the corners . one way to eliminate them is to cut the image with trans@@ form@@ able cutting from the image processing .
&amp; edited ; requires a number of libraries and other packages to read and write image formats . therefore , the available formats depend on your system and , in some cases , from the way these libraries are compiled . in most distri@@ butions , you will be able to edit a large number of picture formats with &amp; edited .
because of this depen@@ dency of other libraries it is impossible to place a list of all file formats available on their system . however , you will always find JPEG and TI@@ FF below .
&amp; digi@@ plug ; shows only files in formats to which you know . this happens based on file extension and a comparison of those with a pre@@ defined list . if the extension is listed in the list , edit the file in image editing . you can change this list of file extensions , edit &amp; edit . see the Con@@ figuration section for more information .
almost all digital cameras store photos in one of two formats : JPEG or TI@@ FF . some cameras even allow you to select the format to be used . a more detailed description of these file formats can be found in Wikipedia .
image compression is the application of data compression techniques on digital images . redundant information is reduced in order to save image data in a more efficient way .
JPEG 2000 is also supported . generally , there are better , smo@@ other results than JPEG in the same compression ratio . the 200@@ 0s version can also store los@@ s@@ less if specified in the settings .
if you want to learn more about the raw image format , you can read on Wikipedia , The L@@ umin@@ ous Land@@ scape and Cambridge in Colour very helpful instructions in English . you can convert raw format images in JPEG or TI@@ FF to the raw image converter from &amp; digi@@ plug ; in the Con@@ figuration section you will find further information on how to use Mod@@ ules with &amp; digi@@ plug ; .
&amp; digi@@ plug ; supports the loading of raw images only with the program d@@ cra@@ w which is included in &amp; digi@@ code ; it contains more than 200 raw file formats . all supported cameras can be viewed at the bottom of the web page of Dave Coff@@ in . the table below shows a short list of shell formats supported by &amp; digi@@ kam .
many digital cameras support the recording of short films . these clips are often stored in the A@@ VI@@ - or MPEG format . &amp; digi@@ kam ; is not a film editing program and therefore has no built @-@ in possibilities to display or edit movies . if you click on a movie file &amp; digi@@ kam ; the &amp; k@@ de ; settings to play movies use to launch the program for playback .

if you change steps 4 and 5 , what you can do well if the initial contrast was already very good , then you can perform the first four adjustment with the White Balance module .
many tools you need to edit the photo editing are included in &amp; edited . your description will follow here .
all image processing tools like sharpen@@ ing , m@@ oll@@ us@@ cs , noise suppression , re@@ focusing , in@@ sharp mas@@ king , &amp; etc ; . use a uniform dialog type that displays the effect in a preview before the filter is applied to the current image . below you can see &amp; quot ; texture user quot ; in this dialog :
( 1 ) : this progress bar shows the status of the filter on the current image . to the left of it allow five buttons to change the comparison mode of the preview area . these modes are :
vertical divide without dup@@ licate . the left area shows the original and the right shows the filter applied to the area on the right of the selected area .
horizontally divide without dup@@ licate . the upper section shows the original and the lower one shows the filter applied to the area below the selected preview area .
the left section shows the original and the right to compare the effect of the filter .
horizontally divide . the upper section shows the original and the lower one for comparison the effect of the filter .
&apos;@@ mouse over &apos; -@@ style : shows the preview when the mouse is not in the preview pane and otherwise the original .
( 2 ) : there are two buttons that you can switch on to show over@@ - and under@@ exposure . the colors used can be adjusted in the general settings page .
( 3 ) : the frame to select the preview . you can drag this frame with the mouse inside the image and place it on the part of the image you want to preview . preview in the left part of the dialog will be instantly updated .
( 5 ) : in the lower left corner : here is a help and the possibility to reset all buttons to your default values . all settings from the last use of the module are noted .
the properties panel shows the essential information about the selected image and is largely self @-@ explan@@ atory . it is group@@ ed in the following sections :
photo Properties : shows a summary of the most important parameters when shooting the photos . these data come from the EX@@ IF data when they are available .
this tab provides an intuitive card search tool based on the Mar@@ ble Mini@@ program . you can move in or out with the mouse wheel or hold it and move it . move it while you click the left mouse button . all images within these coordinates are filtered and displayed .
&amp; color@@ edit ; is an editor for pal@@ ettes files . the application can be used to manipul@@ ate color pal@@ ettes and for selecting and nam@@ ing colors .
the pallets files that are installed by &amp; k@@ de may apply either for the whole system or only one user . in the latter case they are in your personal folder for &amp; k@@ de ; settings and hot user defined color and last used colors .
in the Palette you can select from a list of the installed pallets or browse the folders for files .
the cursor is displayed as a line in the pallet view . it can be moved by clicking on the area next to a color .
it shows the color beside it . the color is described under the pallet view . here , the color name can also be changed .
to create such a selection , click on the area next to a color to move the cursor to it . then move the mouse with pressed left mouse button .
if the check box Bei@@ m C@@ ursor is activated under the button Color , the color is inserted from the color table to the cursor . the color is either inserted or over@@ written another ; depending on whether the mode is selected over@@ write . this mode can be set by selecting the check box over under the cursor .
a selection that has been created as described in the last section can be used along with the actions Copy , Cut and Pa@@ ste .
&amp; color@@ edit ; uses the following format for data in the clip@@ board : for each color three values for the proportions of red , green and blue and an optional color name , followed by a line end sign , if another color follows . if so , if there are three numbers in the clip@@ board , these can be inserted as a color in &amp; k@@ color@@ edit ;
the colors in the palette and the output of colors can be dra@@ gged with the mouse .
select a color somewhere on the screen and then find them in the color selection on the left .
&amp; k@@ graphi@@ cally ; is a K@@ DE program for viewing &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; -@@ dot ; -@@ programs are free layout programs . graphs are used in science , especially in computer science . so far there has been no modern &amp; GUI ; program to visu@@ alize graphs .
the &amp; k@@ graphi@@ Viewer ; project has set itself the goal of replacing these programs with a modern and user friendly graphical interface with all functions of a well integrated &amp; k@@ de ; program .
&amp; k@@ graphi@@ cally ; is a K@@ DE program for viewing &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; dot ; -@@ graph@@ .@@ s &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; programs are free layout programs . &amp; k@@ graphi@@ cally ; displays graphs with all the features of a well integrated &amp; k@@ de ; program in a modern and user @-@ friendly &amp; GUI ; an . it has the following functions :
integration in &amp; k@@ ate ; and &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; ( so that a change of the graph in &amp; k@@ ate ; the graph will be re @-@ calculated and displayed in &amp; k@@ diagram viewer ; )
menu to open the graph in &amp; k@@ ate ; open or open the graph in &amp; k@@ diagram viewer ; in a &amp; k@@ ate ; component
loading large graph@@ ene ( currently there are problems of about 1000 nodes and a h@@ ack to show more than these nodes )
additional required software : &amp; k@@ diagram viewer ; is a &amp; k@@ de ; program that pres@@ upp@@ oses the &amp; graphi@@ vi@@ z ; tool &amp; dot ; for the representation of graphs . needed in detail :
the main window displays the opened graph , each in its own sub @-@ window . initially , when you start &amp; k@@ diagram viewer ; without an argument , the main window is empty as in the bottom screen shot . in this case , the toolbar contains only the icon file open and the ( empty ) list of last opened files . click the first icon to open the dialog file .
after you have selected one or more &amp; dot ; the main window looks like in the lower screen shot :
as you can see , an overview in the corner is displayed when the graph is larger than the drawing area . you can select a fixed position of this overview with the context menu or select this position automatically .
use the mouse wheel ( high and down without special buttons , left and right with pressed &amp; Alt + key ) ;
the zo@@ oming is limited in both directions by factor 10 . below you see the maximum reduction of a graph .
if the currently loaded file has been modified by another program , the following window will be displayed :
you can choose whether the graph will be re@@ charged or whether you want to ignore the change . &amp; k@@ graphi@@ Viewer ; can your decision also note , so that it will later proceed as well . if you want to change your decision later , you can set up the menu item Settings k@@ diagram viewer ; see also .
if you open a graph file outside a running &amp; k@@ diagram viewer ; eg ; in the file browser or command line , you have the choice if you want to open a new &amp; k@@ diagram viewer ; or want to display the graph to be loaded in a sub @-@ window of the already running instance .
as with the last option , you can save your choice dur@@ ably , but also change it with the setup dialog .
at program start , you can open all graphs of your last session again . again , you can save your choice both as well as change later .
you can also specify how the graph should be split to several pages . the number of horizontal and vertical sides can be freely chosen .
when you use multiple pages , you can choose whether the parts of the graph coming to a page are to be adapted to this page . if you maintain the aspect ratio , the pages may not be filled in by the respective sections of the graph .
page preview with a graph across multiple pages without head@@ line and with another font
the Er@@ ne@@ ut store page gives you the ability to specify behavior when a file has been modified on the hard drive , &amp; eg ; from another program . you can set a default behavior ( automatically rel@@ o@@ ad or ignore the changes ) or let the program ask for each time .
the opening page gives the possibility to specify the behavior of &amp; k@@ diagram viewer ; you can define a default behavior for this case ( open the graph in a new window or in a sub @-@ window of the already running session ) or specify that each time is asked .
the session management page gives you the ability to specify the start behaviour of &amp; k@@ diagram viewer ; you can set a default behavior ( open or not ) or determine the default behavior of each start .
the context menu , which usually appears with a click in the main window with the &amp; R@@ MB@@ n , opens up further possibilities :
here you can choose between different &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; -@@ Layout algorithms . the entries , as described on the &amp; graphi@@ vi@@ z website , are :
the algorithm sets the edges in the same direction ( from top to bottom or from left to right ) and then tries to produce as short edges and as few edge overl@@ aps as possible .
the &amp; ne@@ ato ; algorithm is the standard for ung@@ eri@@ zed graph@@ ene . it produces representations in accordance with the spring model . the Kam@@ ada @-@ Ka@@ wa@@ i algorithm is used , which is equivalent to statistical multi@@ dimensional sc@@ aling .
the &amp; F@@ DP ; algorithm creates a boun@@ ce model layout for ung@@ eri@@ zed graph@@ ene . it uses the Fru@@ den@@ man Rein@@ gold he@@ ur@@ istics , and includes a multi @-@ grid sol@@ ver for the treatment of large and clu@@ stered graphs .
the &amp; Cir@@ co ; algorithm ranks the nodes in a circle according to the description of Six and Tol@@ lis , 1999 , and K@@ auff@@ man and Wiese , 2002 . it is useful for certain diagrams of multiple cycli@@ c structures .
open a dialog where you can specify a layout command that is executed by a shell . the command should accept the graph file as parameter , and specify the calculated layout of the graph to st@@ d@@ out in x@@ dot format . with such a layout command you can give &amp; eg ; the &amp; graphi@@ vi@@ z ; algorithms change special options , or even change the graph with a filter before it is drawn .
determines the type of graph ( directed or executed ) and applies the standard algorithm for the respective type ( dot ; for directional , &amp; ne@@ ato ; for ung@@ eri@@ ved graph@@ ene ) .
if this setting is enabled , the overview will be shown if this is necessary . otherwise it will not be displayed and the positioning menu is in@@ active .
displays the What is the mouse cursor . click on a &amp; GUI ; element to get more help on this element ( if any ) .
a list of changes is available at this address and in the file Ch@@ ange@@ Log in the base folder of the source archive .
&amp; k@@ graphi@@ Viewer ; is a &amp; k@@ not ; program that uses the &amp; graphi@@ vi@@ z ; tools for representation . it requires the following program packages :
a special setup is not necessary to use &amp; sound viewer ; in the Settings menu you will find more options .
the main window of the symbol editor is divided into five areas : the main toolbar , the bar for drawing tools , the status bar , the .@@ color palette and the grid where you draw the symbol .
creates a new icon . if the current file has been modified , you &apos;ll be asked if you want to save the changes . after that , a dialog will appear in which you can choose whether to create the icon from a template , or whether you want to start from scratch .
re@@ stores the last revers@@ ed step . if you have not made a step back , this function is de@@ activated .
adds clip@@ board contents as a new image ( if the clip@@ board contains a symbol ) .
sets the current symbol in gray scale . this can create colors that do not coinci@@ de with those of the &amp; k@@ de symbol palette .
does not change the symbol , but sets the current drawing color to the color of the point you click .
the status bar shows you the current actions . from left to right , it shows you the x and y coordinates of the current pixel , the size of the current drawing area , the magni@@ fication factor and the current number of colors of the symbol .
adds clip@@ board contents as a new image ( if the clip@@ board contains a symbol ) .
open with Settings &amp; ki@@ con@@ edit ; set up ... a dialog with the three pages templates for symbols , background and tool@@ bars .
with buttons Add ... , Edit ... and Rem@@ ove , you can change the templates for Standard File , Source File , Com@@ pressed File &amp; etc .
choose Transpar@@ ent pixel insert or display a ruler and display a color : or a ch@@ ess@@ board as a transparency display . you can also choose the size for the ch@@ ess@@ board : the Kar@@ os on Klein , Medium and Large as well as the color 1 : and color 2 : select .
reading the K@@ IP@@ I module images provides tools to read and save new images .
this module can be used to read and save new images from external sources . currently , two sources can be used :
scan images : uses the K@@ oo@@ ka interface to read images from a scanner that is supported by the SA@@ NE project or another source such as video streams . to make this work you have to have K@@ oo@@ ka and SA@@ NE installed .
when you open the menu entry , a dialog appears that lets you select between all available sources on your computer . select the source from which you want to pick the image . you can also set the default source for the next time .
after that , the K@@ oo@@ ka window appears by changing the default values duc@@ tile to select your image . view the preview and adjust the range to your needs before you scan the image with the button . the estimated file size will be displayed in the right , bottom corner . in the K@@ oo@@ ka manual you will find more information .
make sure that the window will be displayed completely , as some settings may not be displayed .
after pressing the button you have to wait until the scan is completed and the window to set the options of the target image appears . please remember that the type BM@@ P does not comp@@ ress and therefore creates very large files . you must also select the folder &amp; # 160 ; select or create by saving the image .

the K@@ IP@@ I module for geographic loc@@ alization allows to add and edit GPS coordinates in the metadata of an image . geographic data is stored in the EX@@ IF keywords of the image and the loc@@ alization can be displayed in a map in an external browser .
the K@@ IP@@ I module for geographic loc@@ alization provides tools for loc@@ ating images ge@@ ographi@@ cally in the spher@@ ical coordinate system used by GPS and Galil@@ eo . height , length and l@@ atitude are used .
to cor@@ relate your images with geographic data you need a GPS track as XML file in the GP@@ X @-@ format . g@@ ps@@ ba@@ bel and g@@ ps@@ man can download and convert the data for you from your GPS device .
image Ge@@ ographic Loc@@ alization Cor@@ rel@@ ator . this interface can merge a number of previously selected images with a GPS track .
select the images you want to cor@@ relate in the main window and enter the menu . the dialog above appears then . to make a possible correlation over time and loc@@ alization , you need to load a track file with GP@@ X file . of course , this file contains data that were recorded at the same time in the same places as the pictures of your camera .
if the file is loaded an automatic correlation is performed to indicate the coordinates in red . GPS track data is recorded in GMT time and therefore the camera time must be converted to GMT . this can be done with the time zone .
the maximum time deviation is an upper deviation for the GPS time and camera time . if the deviation is below , the data is merged . the maximum value for this is 2000 seconds .
if you do not have track data from one place for pictures , you can manually edit the GP@@ X file and add it to the images . then , the time difference of 2000 seconds will cor@@ relate all images in this field .
the options inter@@ pol@@ ate and difference in minutes can be used if you do not have suitable data . if you know that in reality a location is located in a large time difference between camera and GPS , you can set these limits here and then press the button cor@@ relate to inter@@ pol@@ ate .
the coordinates can be set manually with this dialog . this is useful when you have made a number of photos at the same location . as the dialog closes the coordinates from one call to the next , you just need to use the OK button to put the data in the current photo .
the location can also be found and placed with the displayed map . select the relevant region and enlarge si@@ e.@@ Ad@@ just this again until you have reached a sufficient accuracy . the height must always be selected manually . the map can be changed between card mode , satellite image and a mixed mode .
completely outside the K@@ IP@@ I module there are possibilities to attach the GPS data to the images . here is a small script that uses the exi@@ ft@@ ool to provide a stack of images with GPS data .
the K@@ IP@@ I Module Gallery is a tool for ex@@ porting a set of albums as HTML pages .
this module can export your albums into a picture gallery from HTML pages to version 4.@@ 01 . you can select the albums to export as HTML pages and specify the parameters for the HTML pages . the character set will be enco@@ ded U@@ TF @-@ 8 to enable the best internation@@ alization possible .
the tab allows you to select all albums that should be exported to HTML . you only need to select these albums . the albums are not displayed hierarch@@ ically . with the three buttons on the right , you can quickly select a large number of albums . in the section below , the preview and the text will appear in the header of the HTML page .
the Ri@@ der Ap@@ pear@@ ance defines the general appearance and layout for each page . this tab is largely self @-@ explan@@ atory . the option For each image creates a page created a gallery in which each image also gets its own page . if you then click on a picture , a new page will be opened in which the image will be displayed . otherwise , the picture will be displayed directly with your standard picture viewer ,
the Ri@@ der Album defines the settings where and how to store the gallery with all your associated images . select a folder where you have write permission . a sub@@ folder named K@@ IP@@ I@@ HTML@@ Export which contains everything will be created there .
if you have selected the JPEG file format , the EX@@ IF information of your original images will also be saved in the new images .
with other color depth , you can change the default color depth . of course , this also influences the file size . all other settings are self @-@ explan@@ atory .
the rider thumb@@ nails will allow you to customize some of the settings from the Album tab for the preview images , which are small images that are displayed in the gallery .
a progress window will show the user how far the action is . press Canc@@ el to cancel the process .
if the module has created the pages , the window will not be closed automatically . you can therefore read the messages to see if errors occurred while generating . the web browser is started automatically at the end to view the preview of the gallery . press Cl@@ ose to close the module .
the K@@ IP@@ I Image viewer is a very fast and flexible Open@@ GL @-@ based tool to view images .
the K@@ IP@@ I Image viewer allows you to view a selection of images and to perform basic operations such as rot@@ ations , zo@@ oming or moving . the viewer can be used with short commands and mouse buttons . it has been developed for fast visual display and quick access to its functions .
after the start , an image will be displayed in full screen mode by default . this can be changed to a window mode .
the K@@ IP@@ I JPEG Los@@ s@@ less module is a tool for changing images without compromising your quality .
this module allows you to save images in JPEG format for the actions below , without the usual loss of quality or metadata .
the consequence of los@@ s@@ less storage is that the file size increases as no compression of the color information takes place . this can be found in P@@ NG format , for example .
the K@@ IP@@ I module digital camera client is a tool for you to connect your computer to a digital camera .
the K@@ IP@@ I module digital camera client currently has no documentation . if you are interested in writing these , please contact the mailing list of the K@@ IP@@ I team at k@@ de @-@ imaging @ k@@ de@@ .@@ or@@ g. attention : the participants of this list speak English .
the K@@ IP@@ I module metadata editor now has no documentation . if you want to change this situation , please contact the mailing list k@@ de @-@ imaging @ k@@ de@@ .org of the K@@ IP@@ I team .
with the Import function of the metadata module you can copy data from one image to another . then , select the image that you want to copy in the main program and then call the import function . this then opens the file selection dialog with which you can copy the target image , so the image you want to copy the metadata .
this function does not work with all image formats . you can copy from anywhere , but do not write in any target format . JPEG is supported by writing . please look here to see which formats are supported .
the K@@ IP@@ I MPEG Ko@@ di@@ erer Module is a tool to convert a series of images to a MPEG video in the form of a slide show .
the MPEG Ko@@ di@@ erer module can be used to convert selected images to a MPEG video , with a defined length . this module uses the M@@ j@@ p@@ eg@@ Tools and Ima@@ ge@@ Magi@@ ck packages . you can also add a base image transition between the individual images . you can also add an audio file in the MP@@ 2 or WAV of the slide show .
all images are automatically sc@@ aled to the correct size for the selected video format . additionally , you can select a background color for the video format . with this module it is possible to create the formats DVD / X@@ V@@ CD / SV@@ CD / V@@ CD for your DVD player . to burn the medium you can then use the K@@ 3@@ b program .
you must first select the images that are to be packed into the MPEG Di@@ ash@@ au . then you can launch the module using Extras MPEG Di@@ asch@@ au .
the images selected by you are then listed among the image files in the portfolio . there you can also change the sorting of the images or the content of the list .
after you are happy with your list , you should adjust the other settings . the video format can be selected from various formats , DVD , X@@ V@@ CD , SV@@ CD and V@@ CD . if you are planning to play the file on a TV , you need to select the appropriate TV standard PAL , SE@@ CAM or NT@@ SC . PAL is default and most likely the right choice for Europe .
in the next step you should specify the time in seconds that will display a picture . the speed of the image transition is specified below . a low value creates very sudden , a high contrast , very smooth picture change .
the background color can be set next . in doubt , you should let them black . you can specify the name and path of the generated file under the name of the m@@ peg output file . keep as soon as possible the extension mp@@ g .
if you specify an audio file under the name of the audio source file , it will be integrated into the movie . after adjusting all settings to your preferences , you can start the creation of the movie using the button code . depending on the speed of your computer , you can now quickly or quietly enjoy a cup of coffee and enjoy the slide show when you are back .
if an indication appears that enco@@ ders or tools are missing , you can adjust the paths to the programs of the M@@ j@@ p@@ eg@@ Tools and Ima@@ ge@@ Magi@@ ck packages via the button settings right down .
print Wi@@ zard allows you to print multiple images on a sheet of paper in standard photo sizes . the combined images can also be opened automatically with the image processing Gim@@ p . this is , for example , useful to improve or print directly with the Gim@@ p module .
with this K@@ IP@@ I module you can import or convert your images stored in RAW format to one of three formats JPEG , TI@@ FF or P@@ PM .
the conversion is based on the command @-@ line tool d@@ cra@@ w by Dave Coff@@ in . an original quote from Him is : do not expect from d@@ cra@@ w that it produces the same results as the software from your camera manufacturer . sometimes you get better results with d@@ scra@@ w ! .
first select the RAW file to be converted and start the module . the Ra@@ w image converter window then appears in the mode for a single image . with the button Pre@@ view you can view the effect of your current settings on the image .
you can now adjust the values to optimize the conversion process . the first option determines whether the camera settings should be used for the white balance . the essential parameters such as g@@ amma , brightness and red / blue amplifier can be adjusted . if the result is not optimal , you can edit the image later on .
a four @-@ colour R@@ G@@ BG conversion can be selected so that you can use the contrast information . if your camera works in RGB mode , the R@@ G@@ BG switch does not have any effect .
once you are satisfied with the preview , you can choose one of the three output formats and save the conversion result . JPEG uses a los@@ sy algorithm and produces the smallest file sizes for it .
the Tag@@ ged image format , TI@@ FF , keeps all the information of your image and uses the los@@ s@@ less LZ@@ W compression .
if you intend to process your images frequently or later use it otherwise , you shouldn &apos;t choose the JPEG format , as there is only a limited number of operations allowed before the image quality is wor@@ sen@@ ed . TI@@ FF and P@@ PM are better adapted to keep the original data .
if you choose JPEG as a storage format , the metadata contained in the RAW file is stored in the JPEG file in the ex@@ if information .
if you have adjusted your settings , you can start the conversion using the execute button . if you want to cancel this process again , you can use Canc@@ el .
the batch processing mode allows you to convert different images at once . therefore , use this mode if you are sure , e.g. by testing on a single image , which are the best settings .
the available settings are almost identical to the version for single images . however , you have the possibility to over@@ write existing files automatically . this is useful if they were created in an earlier attempt . however , a preview is not available . the progress bar shows how far the conversion has progres@@ sed .
this module can be used to comp@@ ress all images in an album . it uses the program convert from the Ima@@ ge@@ Magi@@ ck package . the following image formats are supported :
this module can be used to ren@@ ame all images of an album . you can set the pre@@ fix , the start number and the tim@@ est@@ amp of the album .
this module can be used to change the size of multiple images from an image collection . it uses the convert program from the Ima@@ ge@@ Magi@@ ck package . you can reduce or enlarge the image . in addition , four types of image change are provided :
proportional ( 1 D@@ im . ) : normal size change in a dimension . the width or height of the image is selected automatically depending on the orientation of the image . the aspect ratio remains unchanged .
proportional ( 2 D@@ im . ) : change in size in two dimensions . here , the aspect ratio remains unchanged . you can use this option for example to adjust your image to the screen size .
not proportional : not proportional size change in two dimensions . the aspect ratio is changed with this option .
pre@@ press : prepares the image for photo printing . the user can adjust the print resolution and the size of the photo paper . the target image , including background size , random size and background color , is adjusted accordingly .
with this K@@ IP@@ I module you can send selected images with your preferred e @-@ mail program . it is also possible to change the size of the images to be sent before .
after you have started the module , the image window will be displayed with the images you have selected . you can add more images using the button Add images . for the last image selected , a preview will be displayed on the right .
you can also drag and drop images to the list of images to be sent .
using the Images button , the selected images will be removed from the list of images to be sent .
after you have selected all the images , you can open the new message window to your e @-@ mail client using the OK button . you just have to add the addresses and the subject here . the images selected by you are already attached as attachments .
do not mind to send too many images at once . most e @-@ mail accounts have restrictions for the size of emails to send . it might be a good idea to send multiple mails if you want to send many images .
the E @-@ Mail window is used to change the settings for sending the images . your configuration will be saved and used every time you change it .
select your E @-@ Mail client from the menu . if you select Thunder@@ bird , you will need to enter the right path for your installation in the input field below .
if you use the Google Mail Service , you must first install the G@@ mail agent on your computer . you can download it here .
after selecting comments in an attached file , add comments to the images in a text file and add the mail .
the P@@ NG format under the File Format menu is not very suitable to reduce the size of photo files , but it is best adapted to los@@ s@@ less formats such as TI@@ FF . you should therefore use P@@ NG when you have a fast internet connection and the photo quality is not to be changed . otherwise , we recommend the JPEG format .
if you select JPEG in pictures file format and the original files are in JPEG format , then the original Ex@@ i@@ f@@ data will be added to the images to be sent .
when the process is finished , the window will not automatically shut down so that you can view the status messages , searching for errors . your e @-@ mail program will be started automatically at the end .
after starting the module Advanced Di@@ ash@@ au , a window with questions like you would like to show your slides will appear . you can choose between the selected and all pictures of the album .
the Open@@ GL transitions option in the presentation will activate very elegant image transitions using Open@@ GL . however , you have to have a corresponding graphic card , otherwise the slide show will be very slow .
the file name option ensures that the file name of the images is displayed in the lower left corner during the presentation .
the loop option ensures that the presentation will be displayed in an endless loop . you can then manually start off with Es@@ c .
the option to select images random@@ ly ensures that the images are displayed in random order . so it is not the order of the images used in the album .
between the pictures , the temporal distance between the images can be set . 1500 mill@@ is@@ ec@@ onds are equal to 1.5 seconds and are a good standard value . however , the best distance depends on your computer and the selected transition effect .
there are more than a dozen transition effects between which you can select . random@@ ly select another effect between the images .
during slide show , you can access a toolbar at the top left edge of the screen . move the mouse to this corner to turn on .
with this toolbar you can pause and restart the presentation , jump to the previous and the next image and stop the slide show .
at the left bottom of the screen you can see the current file name , position of the current image and the total number of images in your presentation .

the K@@ IP@@ I module background image is a tool to set a picture as a background image for the working surface .
this module uses the currently selected image , depending on the selected option of the sub@@ menu , as a background for your K@@ DE desktop .
once you have ann@@ ot@@ ated your pictures and videos with notes , you can browse with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; through these browsers , see picture . as you can see through a comparison with the image , are now available in each group , i.e. in people , places and in the group keywords .
in the browser window you see the categories for which you have entered information as you have your pictures and videos with notes . additionally , there are entries to look for EX@@ IF @-@ based information , view the folder structure on your hard drive and of course view the current thumb@@ nails . in the following , each one is described for themselves .
if you press the mouse on the entry , the view of the browser changes . see picture .
if you select another person , only the images on which both people can be seen are displayed . by this selection method you can limit the number of displayed images from a few thousand images to a few individual images .
if you have selected all persons , locations and other settings , you can view thumb@@ nails to view the images of your area of activity .
in the picture each person has the same symbol in front of her name . you can save with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; however , for each person you save your own thumb@@ nail , this also applies to places , keywords and other categories you have defined yourself . see the picture .
to view images next to the name , select the button located on the right of the toolbar . in the pop @-@ up context menu you can select which view you want to use for the current category . this has the advantage that you can view icons with images of persons and at the same time a list of keywords ( if you have no suitable images for your keywords ) .
you have to decide for yourself which image should be displayed for each individual . in order to do this , you need to open the image view window ( in detail ) and select the image for the corresponding person in the context menu . in the check window , you can adjust the magni@@ fication factor to your wishes and select which part of the image to be displayed or cut off .
if you enter the search entry in the main window , a dialog appears that is very similar to the dialog for setting the image properties . you can view this dialog once again in the image .
if you enter a string in the cap@@ tion or description field , the cap@@ tions or descriptions of the images are searched for this text . if you want , you can also enter a date to search for ; the date can be either a part of the total date , i.e. in 1971 , or the complete date . you can also use a range of two dates , such as 1971 @-@ 1980 .
with the options in the lower part of the window , you can search all images according to certain names as you can see in the picture . here , after pictures on which Jes@@ per , but not Anne Hel@@ ene are depicted .
this is the user manual for &amp; photo@@ album ; . if you don &apos;t like to read hand@@ books , but prefer to try the same functions , you have the following alternatives to this manual :
go to the home page of &amp; photo@@ album ; and look at the Quick Start , the screen@@ shots and the introduc@@ tory videos .
launch &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; and in the first dialog , select the demo if you want &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; start the first time , or select the menu entry k@@ photo@@ album ; demo . then some sample images will be loaded and you can try the functions of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; try .
if you prefer to print out this manual , you will find it on the website of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; as a coherent HTML document for downloading .
at the bottom of the main window of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; see the tim@@ eline . a picture of this bar can be seen here : . as the name suggests , this bar shows you date statistics about the images in your database .
the tim@@ eline can display several different time units . each bar then displays a different unit . you can switch between the units years , months , weeks , hours and 10 minutes . on the picture you can see a part of a database by showing the bar only 10 @-@ minute sections .
the tim@@ eline can be used in the following ways : you can change the displayed preview view from the database ( if you select a date , the first image will display this date in the preview page ) and also displays the current date of the currently displayed pictures when you navigate in the preview pane .
you can also select a range of tim@@ eline by holding down the mouse button and drag the mouse over the ruler of the tim@@ eline , i.e. the time data . if you select an area , in the preview view only pictures of this time period are displayed . you can cancel the selection by clicking on a bar in the tim@@ eline .
&amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; provides you two ways to create HTML websites with your images . the one is in &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; integrated and the other available as module ( see ) . in the following part of the user manual , the in &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; integrated version described , which you can create via the File HTML ... menu .
before creating HTML pages , you need to make some settings . these are divided into the three parts content , layout and target . in the following , each section is described in more detail .
first , enter the title of the review and a description that will contain the HTML file later . on k@@ photo@@ album ; HTML sample pages you see an example of these settings .
next , select whether a &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; -@@ export file should be created which is to be seen on the overview page .
finally , you can select which information to display on the HTML pages . this allows you to avoid information that is obvious to the viewer without description . for example , that all images are from a party . note that all images are exported by a party . you can therefore not use this setting to hide certain images from certain viewers .
in this section you can specify how the HTML pages should look like . most settings are unique , which is why it is not specifically addressed .
at the bottom of the page you can set different resolutions for the images . this means that those who look at your website and own a monitor that supports the maximum resolution 800@@ x@@ 600 does not download any images , which , for example , have a resolution of 16@@ 00@@ x@@ 1200 .
the viewer of your page can change the resolution at any time you have specified . so it can search your images with low resolution , which leads to a lower transmission time . if you want to get an image larger , it changes to a higher resolution .
in this setting , you specify the different folders and the URL where your website is stored .
it is best to select a base folder for all of your HTML files and create a new sub@@ folder for each subsequent set .
first , you need to select the main folder where all your images are stored . this folder will be saved and automatically added next time . this allows you to select the location for all future images . here you can either select a folder or a K@@ DE support protocol , for example :
once you have created your images , you can check if these really are all visible to viewers . if you select a URL for the base folder , a web browser is started after the pages are created . otherwise , the URL you specify here should be this folder . otherwise , the web browser will start in the wrong folder .
if the HTML files created by you are not yet in the final destination folder , you will need to manually copy them to it . thus , the import function , see , properly works you must specify the final destination of the files . this is not the sub@@ folder of the current files , but the base folder where all the sub@@ folders are located .
the settings described above have all three related to base folders or URLs . in these , a sub@@ folder is created , whose name you specify in the output folder .
if you are on a family celebration , a meeting in the company , a conference or somewhere else , with other users of &amp; photo@@ album ; come together , you might want to create your pictures with these . however , if you have already spent a lot of time doing it , you have to work with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; do not even do this work again .
with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; you can export a copy of your images to a .@@ k@@ im file . these can import others into your database . the image properties are imported and imported .
there are two different types of .@@ k@@ im files , internal and external . they differ in whether the images themselves are stored in the file , or whether there is only one link to images in the file . the advantage of saving all images into the file is that you have all the images together and that you can pass it independently . however , the obvious disadvantage is the file size .
you can either ex@@ porting a .@@ k@@ in file directly from the File menu ... or together with HTML pages , see , create . if you create a .@@ k@@ im file together with an HTML file , this will be an external .@@ k@@ im file .
an external .@@ k@@ im file searches the images in a tw@@ o@@ fold manner . first , it searches the images that are in the folder of the .@@ k@@ im file . if the corresponding images are not found , then the images of the URL you specified when creating the HTML files are searched . this is only possible if you have created your .@@ k@@ im file using the HTML export .
in the following , the dialog for ex@@ porting images can be described , which you can view via the File Export menu .
the most important option of this dialog is whether it should be internal or external .@@ k@@ im . there are three choices available :
with the Manual Manual in the vicinity of the .@@ k@@ im file , you will need to copy the images to the same folder as the .@@ k@@ im file .
with the option Automati@@ cally copy the .@@ k@@ im file copied &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; the images automatically for you .
.@@ k@@ im files are normal zip files . since most pictures have already been compressed with JPEG , and the XML file itself is very small , it is usually not worth comp@@ ressing the files . if you want to do so , simply select the Export file option .
the last option of this page is to limit the maximum image size . if you send images to your friends , you might not want to send the images in full size since the .@@ k@@ im file would otherwise be very large . for example , you can limit size by saying that each image should be at most 800 pixels high and wide .
if you select a file with the extension .@@ k@@ im from the web browser or from the File menu ... menu , &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; import the exported database as described in .
the im@@ porting assistant consists of four steps . first , you need to select which images you want to import , then in which folders the import images are to be copied .
it may be that you can person@@ alize the category of people to the im@@ porting file ( if you are a domain ) , while this category is called by your database . therefore , in the third dialog window you will be asked which categories of the imported file should be imported and which categories correspond to your database .
in the fourth step you can compare the categories of the file to be imported with the categories of your current database .
it has to be easy to browse and view images : if you look at pictures , you often want to jump inside of different picture groups &amp; m@@ d@@ ash ; if you look for example pictures of your Italy holiday and discover a picture with your friend , you might want to see all the pictures on which this friend is depicted .
in this manual , you will go through the various steps of ( 1 ) setting the information about your images , via ( 2 ) through browsing and viewing , up to ( 3 ) advanced themes and custom@@ ization options .
K@@ Photo@@ Album has been started as a program to manage your pictures . it has been extended and today it also takes care of your videos . in many places in this manual is spoken about pictures , but often this also includes videos with .
&amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; stores all its information in the file inde@@ x@@ .x@@ ml in the top folder of your images . it is a simple XML file that you can backup with a program of your choice , e.g. Nor@@ mal Backup Tools , copy to a flo@@ ppy or re@@ visions in CVS , where you want .
&amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; records the folder where your images are stored and will automatically re @-@ use it in future starts . if you want to read another folder tree with images , you can launch &amp; photo@@ album ; with the -@@ c option . for example : k@@ photo@@ album -@@ c ~ / company / images / inde@@ x@@ .x@@ ml .
through the menu entry Settings k@@ photo@@ album ; set up ... you will get to a window with which you can change the settings of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; in the following section of the user manual , you will discuss the various settings options .
on the left you can see six different icons with which you can view the settings of the preview and the options for the viewer . for each setting , a detailed help is available , which you can access by pressing a button on the F1 key and a click on the desired option .
it was described how you can define different properties for each image , e.g. people , places and keywords . you can also create your own groups , such as objects , animals or albums .
click on the dialog box to edit already existing groups . for each existing group , you can select a label and a symbol .
in the section sub@@ categories have already been mentioned . in the Options dialog , you can set up complete member groups , e.g. all members of a group at once in a group , instead of all groups of a member explained as explained .
in the list below you can select the category you want to configure . in the left half of the window you will find a list of the current category and a list of sub @-@ categories in the left side of the window .
&amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; spl@@ its its module system with other graphic applications , such as digi@@ K@@ am and G@@ wen@@ view . this module system is called K@@ IP@@ I and means &amp; k@@ de ; image plugin interface .
the modules can be accessed via the Module Module . the modules can and will not be described in this manual since they are not part of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; however , most modules have a help page that you can access via the module itself .
since modules from multiple applications are used together , it may be that the modules were tested with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; only very little tested . therefore , you should always first test new modules with the demo database before using them on your own images . you can either use the command line with the command &gt; k@@ photo@@ album -@@ demo &lt; us@@ er@@ input \ &gt; or via the Help menu .
the applications using the modules over K@@ IP@@ I are very different , whereby it can be that some modules with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; not work . this is the disadvantage of sharing functions with different applications .
the biggest difference between &amp; photo@@ album ; and other applications that also use K@@ IP@@ I is that the other applications can put their images into albums . even if &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; this kind of order does not support , it simul@@ ates the order of albums for some modules , so that you can use the functions with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album .
simulated &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; the current album that simply corresponds to the current view , i.e. all images that show you the picture preview right now .
in addition to the current album , &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; the modules also have to pass a list of albums . here goes &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; as follows :
if &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; s Browser shows the content of a category , e.g. all persons , each entry of this category is an album for the module .
or it will use the category you specified in the settings dialog as a category for virtual albums . so , for example , if you use the category people , &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; so do so , whether you have chosen people to view and pass on this to the module .
since some modules with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album are not compatible , you can remove them from the list of modules . start the settings dialog and select in the Module area which modules should be loaded .
on the picture you see an example of a start screen as soon as you start &amp; photo@@ album ; start with your own pictures .
as you are used by any other K@@ DE application , you will see a menu and tool bar at the top . under the toolbar you will see the window with which you can browse your image database . currently , it does not contain much information as you do not yet have any information about your images .
one of the main functions of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; is the possibility to ann@@ ot@@ ate any image with ann@@ ot@@ ations . this includes information about the persons depicted on the picture , where the image was taken , etc . you can set any picture either individually or for a larger number of pictures at the same time . if for example on all images of Jes@@ per is m@@ apped and all pictures taken in Copenhagen .
all these comments can be used for searching and browsing , as you can read in the section . if you want , you can see these notes when using the built @-@ in viewer .
in view of three lists with a text field , you can specify people , places and keywords . these are a very important part of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; since you will always use them when you enter information about your images .
the following idea is based on shifting the images within the list : if you have a family party for example , and on all 50 pictures the same 5 @-@ 10 persons are shown , you can find that the names used up are moved up , the persons can find and assign them faster .
if you prefer to get an alphabe@@ tically sorted list , click the Sor@@ ting icon on the list .
if you have selected notes for each image individually , you may want to edit all the selected images and provide these images with notes . in this case , simply click on the front and back buttons , which are located at the top right of the picture .
if you have recorded several images , e.g. with the same person , then it can be more convenient to mark all these images and use the menu item Sever@@ al entries at once with a note .
Las Vegas , San Francisco , Los Angeles and California are all located in the United States . in addition , San Francisco and Los Angeles are located in California .
on the picture you see a browser window that shows the USA as an over@@ group . to show you that it is an over@@ group , a special symbol is displayed .
in the Comment dialog , it is possible to add an entry to an existing or new sub@@ category . in addition , you can also simply drag one entry to a category and place it there to sort it into a sub@@ category of this entry .
you can move the individual elements of the comment dialog by clicking and moving the bar that forms the upper edge of the frame . you can also make a separate window from a frame by pulling it outside the window area .
if you have adjusted the window &apos;s look to your needs that you are happy with the settings , click on the Options button ... that offers you the possibility to save the current setup and appearance of the window .
you can also hide a frame completely . if you would like to see this window again later , use the Options button ... and then hide the window . you can see this process in the picture .
if you select the entry images in the browser , you will get an overview with preview images of the currently selected images , or all images if you do not have a filter . you can configure the size of thumb@@ nails , by simply dra@@ gging the mouse with the middle mouse button . just try it .
if you drop an image on the background of your desktop , this image will be set as a background image for your desktop .
once you click on an image , it will appear in the picture viewer . if you have not opened a window with an image viewer , a new display window will be created .
you can also delete images in the image preview . simply select the respective images you want to delete and press either the Rem@@ ove button or select Del@@ ete Sel@@ ection in the Edit menu . now the window that you can see in the picture will be displayed .
&amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; provides you with a solution for this problem . you can use with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; i.e. , you may have saved the images somewhere , so that &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; you can record the view from &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; if not all required images can be loaded from the hard drive .
images in which the right upper corner is truncated are not stored on the hard drive . however , for the images 5 @-@ 9 the thumb@@ nails are present , so that &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; you can also view these images with the image viewer .
as you can see , this function requires you to copy files from the folders and copy them back . so far , it doesn &apos;t support you to insert the CD in question . so , if you want to avoid trouble , such as the mess of your pictures , please buy a larger disk to save all images .
in the Picture Gallery , you will find a sub@@ menu with the name privacy . if you want to have a little more privacy , filter the pictures so that at the end those who wish to make you in@@ accessible and click on the Current View menu in the privacy menu . alternatively , you can control all images that your little sister may see , control and lock the menu item Any@@ thing except current view .
with this you have specified which images should be hidden in the case of the case . if you give your laptop to your little sister , simply select the menu entry images , which will hide all the images that you have locked . if you want to get the pictures displayed again , click on lock .
it is also possible to specify a password that must be entered to unlock the images . to set up this password , simply select your password in the privacy menu .
please keep in mind that this picture protection is not very secure . on the one hand , all images on the hard disk and on the other hand can read or delete the password as un@@ encrypted text . this type of password protection is only for those who are with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; not very familiar with the view of private pictures .
the reason you all have your pictures with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; manage and spend hours over hours with it is natural that you want to look at them some@@ time . for this reason , &amp; photo@@ album has a picture _ and video viewer . you can start from the preview as described in .
the viewer can see you in . it of course shows the picture , but additional all the information you have entered via the image , such as who is on the picture , when and where it was made , etc .
if the info box on the upper part of the image you want to see , you can simply drag and drop it with the mouse . you can also configure what information is displayed and whether information should be displayed at all . all these options are available right clicking on the viewer .
if you click on Anne Hel@@ ene , the browser will show you all the pictures of Anne Hel@@ ene . as if you had selected persons from the browser and then Anne Hel@@ ene .
if you have multiple images loaded in the viewer , you can switch between them before and back by clicking the image up and down the image . you can jump to the first and last picture with Pos@@ 1 and End . these functions can also be accessed from the context menu .
if multiple images are loaded in the viewer , you can run them as slide show . &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; then load a new image after a few seconds . how often a new image can be checked by pressing the C@@ trl key and plus or minus . start and stop the slide show by pressing C@@ trl ; S .
a very useful feature of the viewer of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; it is possible to switch to full screen mode . in this mode , the viewer uses the complete space on the screen . simply use the input key to switch to full screen mode and back .
when you use the viewer you can zoom in and zoom in . to zoom in , you can simply drag a rect@@ angle with the mouse . with the Min@@ us button you can zoom out again The plus button zo@@ oms in in the middle of the image . shows how a zoom rect@@ angle is marked and shows the result of the zo@@ oms .
with the point key , you can reset your zoom so that the image is not zo@@ omed . with the key , the zo@@ oms sets so that each pixel corresponds to a pixel of the image on the screen .
note that the only zoom operations that work in videos that come in and out with the plus and minus key are .
with the rotation functions from the context menu you can turn the image . this does not work for videos . you can make notes to the current picture with the menu item notes from the context menu .
if you look at pictures , you can find a picture with a person whose name you have forgotten to put on the image . at the moment you can view the image and open the configuration dialog of the image to enter that name . however , you may prefer to select only the image and view more images .
another situation is that you want to send a number of images to a printer to get the pictures developed on paper . to see which photos you want you can start the viewer with the pictures and mark them as good or bad while you view one by one .
for the two examples above , the viewer gives you the possibility to display images with features while watching them . features are the letters A to Z and you can set a feature by pressing the corresponding letter . in view you see an image with which the features A , B and C are set .
once you have highlighted features on your images , they are available in your browser . so you can see all the images you are editing , printing or whatever you choose , so you can use a module to copy the selected images to a CD or whatever you want to do .
categories and special features can be displayed in the preview view . if you want to display categories in the thumb@@ nail view , then you can add features to the images by simply pressing the letter for the feature after selecting the image . this can be seen here :
sometimes it is not clear what you want to show on a picture . in this case , you will be allowed &amp; k@@ photo@@ album to paint on the picture .
the mixture is not saved with the image , but in the database . in the way you can und@@ o your painted one later .
in the picture you can see a picture on which it was painted . to turn on the painting mode of &amp; photo@@ album ; switch on the painting from the context menu . to termin@@ ate the painting , simply press the cross in the toolbar at the top of the window .
to work with &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er , you need to use the program &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; not completely rule , but the documentation about &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; should you have read and understood absolutely .
in the object tree you can select individual objects . then their properties are displayed in the object properties and the object is displayed in the wi@@ re@@ mod@@ ell@@ - views yellow .
you can also select multiple objects at the same time , but not the object of an already selected object , as all sub@@ objects are already selected using the object .
to insert a new object into the object tree , select the position where you want to insert the object and click on either the toolbar icon or select a menu item in the menu item .
if there are multiple possible positions , the following drop @-@ down menu will be displayed so that you can choose the correct position :
del@@ eting either from the menu bar under Edit or from the right mouse button context menu you can remove selected objects from the scene .
if you have changed properties , click Apply to take these changes . if you have entered invalid values , a message will be displayed with an error description . then you can correct the input errors and click Apply or disc@@ ard the changes .
if you enter the path to &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; -@@ user documentation in the setup dialog , you can call the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; -@@ reference to the displayed object with help .
you need the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; 3.@@ 1@@ g or 3.5 H@@ MT@@ L user documentation to use this feature . if this documentation is not included in your distribution , you can download it here . &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; 3.5 already contains the user documentation .
when you edit a texture or part of a texture , you can see a preview in the property view .
press preview in the property view and a small sample of the scene is rendered with the selected texture . as default , the entire texture is rendered even if you want to render a sub@@ arranged element ( for example a texture inside a texture map and not the entire texture map ) , check locally .
the screen@@ shot shows the control points of the camera . you can drag these check@@ points with the mouse button and change the position and direction of the camera .
when a transformation is selected , the control points disappear and a small cross is displayed in the wire model view . this cross marks the center for sc@@ aling and rotation as well as the position for shifts . you can change the shift by dra@@ gging with the mouse within the entire window .
each object has a visibility level as a wire model . you can specify this value relative to the visibility level of the parent object or as an absolute value . objects are only displayed when they are selected or their visibility level is smaller or equal to the visibility level chosen in the toolbar .
&amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; has a window arrangement as default . the object tree and the view of the object properties are displayed on the left and the four graphical views on the right .
if you don &apos;t like the standard window arrangement or if you need a different arrangement , you can set it arbitrary . you can also store several window arrangements and simply switch between different configurations .
to anchor a window above or under a view , drag the start to the top or bottom of a view . a rect@@ angle then indicates the new position .
to create a new column , drag the start to the right or left side of a view . the new view is then anchored to the right or left side of this view and extends over the entire height .
if you want to arrange multiple views on top of each other , drag the beginner in the middle of a different view . you can then switch between views by clicking on the flash@@ cards top in the views .
the last possible window arrangement are floating screens : views that are not anchored in the main window . to solve a view from the anch@@ or@@ age , drag the beginner onto the desktop or click on the small arrow pointing to the left in the cham@@ fer@@ ing bar .
to close a view , click on the small cross in the cham@@ fer strip . to prevent closing , click the small square between the arrow and the cross .
you can insert additional views into the main window . in the View menu , you will find entries for each type of views . new views are floating , you can anchor them at any point .
you can save the current window view with view window arrangement ... Save . it displays a dialog where you can save the window arrangement under an existing or new name .
if you have created a scene , you can render it . &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; used &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; 3.@@ 1@@ g for rendering , this program must be properly installed . as this manual was written , &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; 3.5 currently . this version is not supported in &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; version 1.0 .
to render the current scene click on the Ren@@ dering icon The icon Ren@@ ders in the toolbar or select the menu entry View scene .
a render mode matches the entries in &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; s ini files . it determines the image size and quality of rendering . if you want to render a scene in different image sizes and quality levels , you can insert any number of render modes , from a quick preview to full images of the highest quality .
when you click on the render settings icon in the toolbar or in the View R@@ ender modes menu , the following dialog will be opened :
each render mode has a name . you can enter any name , but useful is a name that lets you recognize the properties of the mode .
in the map file size , you can enter the width and height of the rendered image . if you want to render only a small area of the image , select the box section and enter the image cut for rendering into the input fields .
in combination field quality you can choose Properties , which &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; for rendering . this comes from a very simple color and light model to a model with complex @-@ diff@@ use reflection light . a detailed description of render characteristics can be found in the User Manual &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; .
if an image is rendered with only one beam per pixel , various errors can arise . these images often have a Mo@@ ir@@ Ã© pattern or step effects in curves and lines , and sometimes details are not displayed when they are smaller than a pixel . this effect is called ali@@ asing .
&amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; uses a technique called anti @-@ ali@@ asing to reduce the impact of these errors . generally , pictures with this property look better .
if you turn on anti @-@ ali@@ asing , calculate and connect &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; more than one beam per pixel . this technique is called super sampling .
&amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; supports two methods of super sampling . as standard is adaptive , non @-@ recur@@ sive method ; adaptive because the super sampling gets the adjacent pixels with it . the second method is adaptive @-@ recur@@ sively ; recur@@ sively because each pixel is again split and adapted because the recur@@ sion depth depends on the calculated color values .
if you choose the first method , POV @-@ Ray tracks a beam per pixel . if the difference between the color values to the adjacent pixels passes the specified threshold , then both pixels are calculated by tracking a certain additional number of pixels with super sampling . if you set the depth value to 4 , a grid of 4x4 incre@@ ments will be calculated , at a depth of 5 then 5x@@ 5 ( 25 ) additional rays per pixel .
the difference between two pixels is calculated as follows : r 1 , g 1 and b 1 are the values for red , green and blue of the first pixel , r 2 , g 2 and b 2 are the values for red , green and blue of the second pixel . the difference is :
training for abs ( 1 -@@ r 2 ) + abs ( b 1 -@@ g 2 ) + abs ( b 1 -@@ b 2 )
the recur@@ sive method starts with 4 rays per pixel . if the difference between the color values exceeds the given threshold , then the pixel is divided into 4 sub @-@ pixels , which are followed individually and checked for further sub@@ division . the maximum depth of recur@@ sion can be adjusted with the depth value .
another way to reduce the ali@@ asing effect is the creation of noise for the ray process called J@@ it@@ tering . if you switch on J@@ it@@ tering , changed &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; the rays by a tiny amount to avoid regular patterns .
the last setting for the quality of rendering is diff@@ use reflection . this is an experimental characteristic of &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; the diff@@ use reflection of light is calculated . it takes a very long time to calculate a scene with this property .
on this map you can specify whether the alpha channels should be calculated by POV @-@ Ray . a pixel is then transparent when the corresponding rays have no object .
open a new window for displaying the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; console output . if &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; un@@ expect@@ edly , you can find the reason here .
to import a &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; scene , select the menu entry file import ... and select a file in the dialog box .
currently supported &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; not yet the complete command range of &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; if error messages or warnings occur when im@@ porting , a dialog box displays a list of all messages .
if you do not support source code in &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; want to import , write this source code between the two particular comments / / * PM@@ Ra@@ w@@ Begin and / / * PM@@ Ra@@ w@@ End .
you can drag objects from the object tree to the editor to export the source code for &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray . this adds to the source code of the object into the open text file in the editor . to import objects to the scene , simply select the source code in the editor and drag it to the object tree .
with copy and paste in &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; and in your editor you can also insert source code for &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; also .
the POV @-@ Ray command is called when &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; a scene ren@@ ders . usually this is po@@ v@@ ray or x @-@ po@@ v@@ ray .
if you click on help in the property view , it opens and k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; s &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; user documentation for the displayed object . place the path to your base and the version . supported are versions 3.@@ 1@@ g and 3.5 .
&amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; searches for external files ( e.g. High Field Data ) in the paths to the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; libraries . if you include files that are not in the folder of the scene , you must also enter the path to these files here . if a file is found in different paths of the library , the first found file is used .
the color for the wire models . the second color is used for displaying the selected objects .
the color for the control points . the second color is used for viewing the selected control points .
the color of the rect@@ angle for the field of view in the camera view and in the window type mark .
you can set the object beginning of the points to the grid in the context menu of the wire model views . you can set the grid separately for shifts , sc@@ aling and rot@@ ations .
larger values result in a more precise wire model and therefore better approxim@@ ation for the displayed objects , but require more time to render . for some objects such as the ball , you can set the level of detail for two directions separately .
if you cross high level of detail for advanced projections , all wire @-@ model views are further sub@@ divided when the camera uses an extended projection . advanced projections are all projections with exceptions of perspective and vertical projections . this feature gives a better approach for projections but requires more time to render .
when you cross the wall , a wall behind the objects is rendered . the wall is displayed in a chess board pattern consisting of two adjustable colors .
when you tick the ground , a ground beneath the objects is rendered . the floor is represented in a ch@@ ess@@ board pattern consisting of two adjustable colors .
if you tick the edge smoo@@ thing , the non @-@ recur@@ sive anti@@ ali@@ asing method is used for rendering the scenes . you can set the values for depth and threshold value .
on this page you can change existing window arrangements or create new window arrangements . in the window arrangement section , it explains how to create and store window orders .
the standard window arrangement : displays all existing window arrangements . &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; uses the selected window arrangement at startup of the program .
the list of windows orders shows all existing window arrangements . you can create a new arrangement with the Add button and delete a selected arrangement with the Rem@@ ove button .
each window arrangement is identified by the name . the name must be unique and must not be empty .
the list below the name shows all the views for the selected window arrangement . new views can be created using the Add button and del@@ eting selected views using the Rem@@ ove button .
new column lets you create a new column on the right of the existing window , with Un@@ ten anchored the window under the existing window , with card card you get a flash@@ card view together with the previous view and floating anchored the view not in the main window , but creates a separate window .
so you just have &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; and &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; installed and now you want to start without any more accurate knowledge of both programs . if you follow all steps in this guide , you should create the ultimate but simple scene , very popular among beginners : a ball on one level .
but you should carefully consider the following warnings before you complain that you only get a black screen as a result . if you use a 3D program for the first time , you should observe these important rules :
if you do not set a camera , no rules can be used for rendering , as a result you get a black picture .
if you do not include light sources , your entire scene is in the dark and you get only a black picture .
if you have installed everything error @-@ free , you will see at the first start of &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; the following default window arrangement :
take a little time to get to know the menus and the existing toolbar icons . please read the documentation to get a reasonable idea of what you can expect from this program .
you will need to use these menus and icons now , so you should remember the menus and icons and their application .
&amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; starts with a simple scene . to follow this guide , first you need to remove all objects from the object tree . select the scene and then select Edit menu item Edit . so you now have a scene without objects .
the wire model view shows how the camera sees the whole scene that you create . in particular , you will notice this in the fourth wire model view ( right below ) . this is the view of the scene from the point of view of the camera . this shows you the result of the rendering of the scene .
the object tree now contains a new entry with the name camera . if you click on it , you will see the contents of the object properties in which the various parameters of the camera are found . in the user documentation of &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray , you will find more details .
do not change the basic settings of the camera , this is reserved for later instructions , but note that the camera in the view has control points with which you can change the target point of the camera . just click on a control point with the left mouse button and drag it to the desired location .
when you apply the Apply button or the Enter key , the wire @-@ model views and the object tree change immediately according to these settings . as a result , they see the scene from the camera &apos;s point of view .
there are many ways to create the floor for the scene . you could , for example , insert a cube ( insert final body qui@@ z ) and adjust the size to x = 100 , y = 0 and z = 100 , but this is a cum@@ ber@@ some method to solve this task .
&amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; actually provides a simpler way . you can use an infinite plane as floor :
a good advice : select the level in the object tree , change the name and then press the Apply button or enter the Enter key . in the object tree the new name will be displayed immediately .
the wire @-@ model view now also shows the level , albeit at the moment only as a fin@@ ite plane . if you render the scene , the plane expands to the horizon .
if you look at the object tree accurately , you will find that you can fold the item for the bottom if you click on the icon + in front of the object . in this case , you will only see the default options for each new object : sc@@ aling , rotation and shift . select one of these options , change the possible settings in the view of the object properties .
in this scene you should move the bottom to the exercise a unit under the horizon line , just to get to know some of these parameters . select shift and set the values as follows :
first select the bottom to adjust its material properties . there are many different materials , but select something simple at the moment .
in both cases , a dialog opens in which you can select how to insert the object . please select first sub@@ object . the pigment will then be displayed in the object tree . you can change the name in the property view ( name = ground pigment ) , with a click on the button Pre@@ view you will see how the pigment looks now .
of course , the preview of the pig@@ ments only shows a matt black material because you have to enter the pig@@ ments settings at any time . always remember that you can check the appearance of materials at any time with a click on thumb@@ nail . also , there are many options again , but now take the easiest .
if you do not see color on the fa@@ der and ball in the preview , click on the Apply button and then call the Pre@@ view .
the material for the floor is now set correctly . if you render your image now with a click on the icon , you should get the following result :
in the color list you need to enter two new attributes . in the color list you must enter two new attributes , called Uni@@ coloured . then edit this entry twice ( you can also do this more frequently , but the ch@@ ess@@ board color list can only be used with two colors ) :
in the object tree , select mon@@ och@@ ro@@ me each time and change the colors in the view of the object properties :
this step should be easy to carry out as you should have understood the basic working method of &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; you should have understood the ball as easy as the floor :
in the view of the object properties , you can immediately change the settings . set the value for the radius : on 1 ( Do not forget to apply the Enter key or the Apply button ) so the ball has contact with the ground . otherwise , the ball would float above the ground as you have moved the bottom to one unit down@@ wards .
of course rendering now results in a strange result : as seen before , the ball surface appears like a matt black material . in the following step , put a suitable material .
if you have selected the ball , you can assign a material to it now . as with the bottom , give the ball a pigment as a color :
select first sub @-@ object and change the name for example in sphere pigment . click on sphere pigment , then select Uni@@ coloured and set the values as follows :
but you can achieve more interesting effects if you take the time to set some finish features :
then change the values as shown in the following screen@@ shots and click Apply or press Enter .
the settings shine effect and reflection already result in good visual effects , perfect for glass or chrome @-@ plated surfaces , even when metal is not selected at all :
you should now have a good impression of what possibilities and k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er . hopefully you have learnt so much that you can create simple but beautiful scenes .
Ray@@ trac@@ y@@ trac@@ ing is a R@@ ender method to create a two @-@ dimensional image of a three @-@ dimensional scene or model .
if you ra@@ y@@ trac@@ ing a scene , the ren@@ derer will shoot hypo@@ the@@ tical rays from the viewer &apos;s perspective ( i.e. from the camera that ren@@ ders the scenes ) by each pixel in the scene . the render calcul@@ ates how this beam is reflected and broken through the objects , the visual effects of light sources in the scene and how atmospheric effects such as fog works .
as you can imagine , you won &apos;t see anything without a camera , the camera is your eye with which you look at the scene . without a light source you also don &apos;t see anything , the image is black . obviously any scene that should be rendered , some light sources and at least one camera .
in the usual file dialog , you can select your file . P@@ ov@@ ray files usually have the file extension * .@@ po@@ v or * .@@ in@@ c .
opens a file . in the default file dialog , you can select a file you have previously created with &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ;
whenever you open or create a new model , the file is inserted into this sub@@ menu and replaces the oldest entry in the list .
if you have already saved the model , it will be saved under the same name . if it is a new file , you will need to enter a name and space .
re@@ covers the scene in the last saved version . all changes since the last saving will be dis@@ car@@ ded .
this menu entry can only be selected if you still have un@@ saved changes in the scene .
repeat the last revers@@ ed command . this menu entry can only be selected if you have used editing und@@ o .
stores the current window arrangement and opens a dialog where you can enter a name for a new arrangement or over@@ write an existing order .
in this menu you will find options for setting &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; here you can change the look , the short@@ cuts and the default behavior .
opens a dialog to change the keyboard short@@ cut . you can change or add new commands for &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er with this option .
opens a dialog to set up the toolbar . you can add and remove tool icons for &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er with this option .
a B@@ ump Map is a way to simulate harsh surfaces without having to model each b@@ ump on the surface individually and without changing the geometric shape of the object itself .
it is common to use the same file for both a dump @-@ map as well as for a texture mapping .
basic bodies are simple geometric shapes that you can use as building blocks : very complex 3D models are created from dozens or even hundreds of these basic bodies . these models are then further mach@@ ined to give them a more realistic appearance .
a texture map is a way to give the surface of an object color to pixel base by applying an image file as a color chart .
&amp; ku@@ ick@@ Show ; is a comfortable image viewer and browser . the application has a file browser in which you can select pictures for viewing .
images can be displayed either in their own window in the size of the image or in full screen mode .
the use of &amp; ku@@ ick@@ Show ; is very simple . the file browser lists files you can view by clicking the &amp; L@@ MB@@ s ; or the Return key .
you can specify whether any image should be displayed in your own window , or whether all images should always use the same window .
if you are looking for a specific file , just type the first character of the file name in the browser window . then a small input field appears in the right lower corner . if a matching file name has been found , the file will be highlighted . you can leave the input field by pressing Return or &amp; Es@@ c .
in the dialog Set@@ ting - &amp; ku@@ ick@@ Show , there are five flash@@ cards . in three of them , general and editing and slideshow , you can set the operation of &amp; ku@@ ick@@ Show ; in the other two , short commands for the display window and short commands for the browser , the short@@ cut keys for each window can be specified .
if this is selected , then the images will be opened in full screen mode . if the image is not large enough to fill the screen , the rest of the display area is filled with the background color that you can set further down . default is not full screen mode .
if this point is enabled , load &amp; ku@@ ick@@ Show ; already the next image in the folder while you still view the current image . this reduces the delay when you select the next image , and is particularly suitable for a slide show .
with this option stores &amp; ku@@ ick@@ Show ; when moving the name of the last opened folder . at the next start , &amp; ku@@ ick@@ Show ; this folder in the browser window .
click on the colored bar to select a background color . this is used to fill the background screen in full@@ screen mode . if in window mode the window is larger than the image , the background will be filled with the selected color .
you can &amp; ku@@ ick@@ Show ; set up that only some of the file types that can display the program can also be displayed .
this option increases the display window to the full screen for large images . this option is turned on as default .
determines whether the slide show should start with the first image in the folder or with the selected image .
to change the value , you can enter a new value in the input field or use the sli@@ der or the small arrows to the right of the input field . default is 3 seconds .
the number of repeti@@ tions . if this value is set to 0 , the slideshow will be repeated until it is abor@@ ted by the user . to change the value , you can enter a new value in the input field or use the sli@@ der or the small arrows on the right of the input field .
change the short@@ cut keys for the various operating modes of &amp; ku@@ ick@@ Show ; in the flash@@ cards short commands for the display window and short commands for the browser .
with this option , switch between the two @-@ part view of the fil@@ esystem ( a window for the sub@@ folders and a window for the files ) and the one @-@ part view of the file system with folders and files in one window .
displays large icons for the files in the folder . this display is only possible in the short display .
displays small icons for the files in the folder . this display is only possible in the short display .
shows thumb@@ nails for the files in the folder . this display is only possible in the short display .
reduces the image by 10 % . the factor relates to the current size of the image .
increases the image by 10 % . the factor relates to the current size of the image .
closes the display window for the images . &amp; ku@@ ick@@ Show ; will also be closed if no browser window is opened .
display the image in original size . this is only useful when automatic sc@@ aling is enabled .
open the input field for completion . enter the first characters of the file name you are looking for . if the file is found , it will be selected .
&amp; show@@ photo ; is a &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ photo editing based on the &amp; edited ; picture editing . &amp; show@@ photo ; is part of the &amp; digi@@ plug ; project .
&amp; show@@ photo ; is a fast image processing with some powerful base tools . you can use it to view your photos and perform corrections and modifications .
like the rest of &amp; k@@ de ; is &amp; show@@ photo ; an open source project . this means that the user will contribute his part contributing to at least problems and possible improvements .
&amp; show@@ photo ; makes it as easy as possible to report errors or possible improvements . wherever you are in the program , the menu contains one entry reports you problems or desires . this displays a dialog with a link . if you use this , your browser will open a page for reports of problems and wishes . all the information you need is already filled out , and you can simply follow the instructions to submit your message .
&amp; show@@ photo ; is a project supported by a community . that means that users and developers can help each other . if you are a common user of &amp; show@@ photo , then we would like to encourage you to answer questions to other users of &amp; show@@ photo ; however , you can ask questions other users soon . in this mailing list , however , English is spoken , you should therefore be powerful this language .
the best start to participate in &amp; show@@ photo ; to participate , it is the developer mailing list to join . guide to join the developer mailing list of &amp; show@@ photo ; .
&amp; show@@ photo ; tries to give you so much control over his work processes as possible . to access these settings , you need to set up the behaviour of &amp; show@@ photo ; set up the settings dialog in eight pages . you can switch between them by clicking on the icons of the left side .
in the area of exposure indicators , you can select the color that is displayed when the under@@ - or over@@ exposure indicator is selected . dex@@ ter@@ ity should display the colors with what you want to display . under@@ exposure should display a bright color and over@@ exposure a dark color .
the Main Window of &amp; show@@ screen@@ .@@ has a side bar on the right that provides you with important information and actions to the selected images . you can also find the same page bar in the image editing . you can view them in which you click on one of the five tabs :
&amp; sc@@ l@@ ite ; is an application for scanning images that no longer power than scan and save images .
&amp; gu@@ l@@ ite ; is a simple application for scanning images that no longer power than images to scan and save . &amp; channels ; can open a dialog to save images for each image or save the images immediately in a specified folder with automatically generated names and format .
you can check the status of the support of your scanner on the SA@@ NE website by entering the necessary information on this search page : HTTP : / / www.@@ san@@ e @-@ proj@@ ect@@ .org / c@@ gi @-@ bin / dri@@ ver@@ .@@ pl .
a standard scanner can be set at the command line of &amp; gu@@ l@@ ite . if this scanner cannot be opened or if no standard scanner is specified , then a dialog to select the scanner will be opened .
the user can select the scanner to use and press OK to open the scanner .
the other settings include more detailed options of the driver . &amp; gu@@ l@@ ite ; ( lib@@ ks@@ ane ) does not handle these options particularly .
in order to scan an image , the user can start a preview scan and then scan for scanning area for the final scan . the preview can be started by the preview button .
in order to select the image better , the user can zoom into the image and zoom out of the current selection . it can also adjust the zoom in such a way that the complete preview will fit in the window .
if the image has been selected , the final image can be read with the scan button .
when saving a preview in the settings selected then the image will be displayed in a preview window as shown below . if saving is pressed , then the image will be saved and Sch@@ lie ? en leads to a demo@@ lition and you will get back to the main window .
the Settings button opens the name of the same name in front of the main window . you can change the most important settings here .
the user can view the image if desired before saving . in this case , the option must be selected before saving . if this preview is not desired by the user , then the option must be selected .
this setting allows them to select the type as &amp; gu@@ l@@ ite ; Save images . open dialog for each image opens the dialog before each scanned image . if &amp; gu@@ l@@ ite ; to automatically save them with a generated name in a previously defined folder , then you need to select Save without following a fil@@ en@@ ame .
this setting defines where the images are stored in the Save without following a fil@@ en@@ ame . if the images are stored after each scan , then this folder will be used as default for the dialog for saving . the default value is your home directory and you can change it by using the button ...
this parameter defines an image pre@@ fix for the images to be saved automatically and is also the proposed name for the image in the dialog for saving . the automatically saved image gets a num@@ eric su@@ ff@@ ix that is uploaded each time a picture is stored . the character string # # # is replaced by the numbers .
the user can adjust the image quality used to save . this value also changes the compression value when saving . if select the image quality is not selected , then the default value of Q@@ t is used .
the button Help starts the K@@ DE support with the &amp; gu@@ l@@ ite ; manual . the button About starts the K@@ DE via dialog for &amp; gu@@ l@@ ite ; the button settings shows the dialog for the settings and closing can be used to finish &amp; output .
&amp; gu@@ l@@ ite ; is licensed under the GP@@ L and the lib@@ ks@@ ane library used by &amp; gu@@ l@@ ite ; note : lib@@ san@@ e is licensed under the GP@@ L with an exception .
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; use like all other programs short@@ cuts . below you will find a list of these short@@ cuts and their function . the global short@@ cuts can be set up by clicking the right mouse button in the player window and selecting Global Tast@@ esp@@ ace . clicking the right mouse button in the player window and setting short commands ... Select .
you may set up existing multimedia keys in such a way that they work as &amp; Amar@@ ok ; short commands function . this will make your keyboard to &amp; Amar@@ ok ; control center .
the D@@ CO@@ P interface of Amar@@ ok has many general functions that can be found in other K@@ DE programs . this section consists of six parts and is intended to describe D@@ CO@@ P functions of collection , context browser , player , playlist , playlist browser and scripts .
Amar@@ ok supports the command @-@ line options of Q@@ t and &amp; k@@ de ; in addition , Amar@@ ok has some of its own command @-@ line options .
you should give the user feedback if the script cannot be executed because of a missing depen@@ dency . please check in your script if all the required modules are present and use k@@ dialog for the user to know why a script does not run .
begin require &apos; Kor@@ und@@ um &apos; Res@@ cue Lo@@ ad@@ Error error = &apos; Cor@@ und@@ um ( K@@ DE bind@@ ings for ru@@ by ) from k@@ deb@@ ind@@ ings v@@ 3.4 is required for this script . &apos; &apos; k@@ dialog --@@ sorry &apos; # { error } &apos; exit end
in the scripts / templates folder , you will find a lot of template scripts in many different languages . you can use them as the basis for your own scripts or simply wi@@ den them to the required functions . you will quickly find that writing scripts is relatively easy .
using D@@ CO@@ P , your scripts can exchange data with Amar@@ ok and control Amar@@ ok . the easiest way is to use the d@@ co@@ p command , which should be included in any K@@ DE installation .
most scrip@@ ting languages make it possible to execute external programs and commands . usually the function ex@@ ec ( ) is used . in this way d@@ co@@ p &gt; can be accessed relatively easily . here is an example in Python :
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; sends al@@ erts to all running scripts . to do this , strings are written to the default script . for this reason , scripts should constantly monitor their default input and react accordingly to events . of course , a script can also ignore events if there is no use for it .
configure the script to view the setup dialog . to save and load the setup data , each script must take care of itself . when a script is started , Amar@@ ok puts the working folder to the folder where all data should be stored .
track@@ Change indicates that a new piece is being played . now the script could &amp; z@@ b ; with D@@ CO@@ P functions it could query more information about the new piece ( for example the metadata or the unit length ) .
volume Change new@@ Volume indicates a change in volume . the new volume is an integ@@ er between 0 and 100 .
custom@@ Men@@ u@@ Cli@@ cked : sub@@ menu it@@ em@@ Tit@@ le paths contains the path to the selected files in the playlist when a custom menu item is cli@@ cked . to remove an entry , you can use d@@ co@@ p Amar@@ ok script add@@ Custom@@ Men@@ u@@ It@@ em ( sub@@ menu it@@ em@@ Tit@@ le ) to remove an entry . to remove an entry , use d@@ co@@ p Amar@@ ok script remo@@ ve@@ Custom@@ Men@@ u@@ It@@ em ( sub@@ menu it@@ em@@ Tit@@ le ) .
before &amp; Amar@@ ok ; exit , or when the user stops a script , sends &amp; Amar@@ ok ; the signal SI@@ G@@ TER@@ M to the script . this signal should be processed in order to do e.g. clearing operations , such as storing data or configuration settings .
Amar@@ o@@ ks script administration can also install script packages that the user &amp; z@@ b has downloaded from a web server . such packages are basically normal T@@ ar Archives ( .@@ tar ) , which can optionally also be zi@@ pped with b@@ zip@@ 2 ( .@@ bz@@ 2 ) .
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; 1.3 will only accept script packages with the En@@ cryp@@ tion amar@@ ok@@ script . for this reason , you should ren@@ ame your script packages .
the main script must be exec@@ utable ( + x ) , the rest to be loaded should not be exec@@ utable . use the T@@ ar parameter -@@ p to get the file per@@ missions :
when your script package is ready , you can app@@ end it to www.@@ k@@ de @-@ app@@ s.@@ org and attach the link to the Wi@@ ki scripts page of &amp; Amar@@ ok . for your entry on k@@ de @-@ apps you should use the category Amar@@ ok ; scripts .
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; is an audio player for &amp; k@@ de ; . &amp; Amar@@ ok ; has many useful and powerful features and is nevertheless surprisingly easy to use .
with &amp; Amar@@ ok , you can simply drag music to the playlist instead of having to go through endless menus . you may also search only a very specific title for thousands in your collection . with &amp; Amar@@ ok ; &apos;s Collection Browser and Quick Search you will find the piece within seconds .
maybe you already have some play@@ lists , but you can never decide what you want to hear ? then , the play@@ lists browser is just the right one for you . and if you still find it difficult , the dynamic mode and the smart play@@ lists automatically select the right music according to certain criteria .
Amar@@ ok has an excellent support for Apple &apos;s iPod , i@@ Ri@@ vers i@@ f@@ p and many generic USB devices . furthermore , many different audio systems can be used , so that YOU can choose how to listen to your music . Amar@@ ok is intelligent , sexy and chic - just the right way to re@@ discover your music !
usually you have to enter the following folder to compile and install Amar@@ ok in the base folder of the Amar@@ ok sources :
da &amp; Amar@@ ok ; auto@@ conf and autom@@ ake used , you should not have trouble while comp@@ iling . if you encounter problems , please report them in the &amp; k@@ de ; mailing lists .
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; like most applications , has some options that you can enable or disable at compile time with the configure script . this is a list of available options .
for some of the compile options , certain depen@@ dencies must be met so that they can be used . details can be found in the System Pre@@ ferences section .
enabled de@@ bu@@ gging symbols . you have the choice between yes , no and full . if you want to help with the development of &amp; Amar@@ ok , you should use full .
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; can be set up without difficulty using the setup dialog . the setup dialog has several card cards to set up the various functions of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; .
in the player window , the player window will be switched on or off in addition to the playlist . if the option is switched off , only the playlist window will be displayed .
use mood bar@@ ometer : this function is only available if &amp; Amar@@ ok ; compiled with support for mo@@ od@@ bar . the option turns on the experimental function of the mood bar@@ ometer .
impressive design : this function is only available if &amp; Amar@@ ok ; compiled with support for mo@@ od@@ bar . this changes the color scheme used for the mood bar@@ ometer .
drop V@@ oting Files to the music files : this feature is only available when compiled with mo@@ od@@ bar . if this setting is enabled , .@@ mood files will be stored on the location of the appropriate music files . otherwise , the .@@ mood files will be stored in the Settings folder of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; stored ( usually ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / Amar@@ ok / mo@@ od@@ bar / ) .
external browser : lets you select which browser of &amp; Amar@@ ok should be started when a browser is required .
other browsers : here you can specify the path to another browser , which is not in the list above .
save Play@@ list when you exit , save the current playlist automatically when you exit &amp; Amar@@ ok ; enable this option if you don &apos;t want to lose the current playlist when you exit .
relative paths for manually stored play@@ lists : when you enable this setting , &amp; Amar@@ ok ; relative paths to the music files , based on the location of the playlist , will be used . otherwise , the absolute position of music files is stored .
to keep the current piece visible when changing the piece , the playlist window will pop up / down to keep the current piece in the visible window area .
when changing parts to the context browser , the context browser automatically displays the context browser as soon as the next piece is played .
in the Ap@@ pear@@ ance section you can customize &amp; Amar@@ ok ; s Ap@@ pear@@ ance . the section is sub@@ divided into three parts .
in the font section , you can set the use of various fonts in &amp; Amar@@ ok . by selecting O@@ wn fonts , the otherwise grey set section is enabled . you can select fonts for the following range : playlist windows , player windows and context browser . press select ... , so you can select a desired font from the selection dialog .
with the Select color scheme , you have the choice of choice and can set your own color scheme . use the color sel@@ ector activated below for foreground and background color .
resume playback causes &amp; Amar@@ ok ; after program start , resume play automatically with the piece at the place where it was stopped at the last stop .
the On @-@ Screen display allows you to switch on the O@@ SD . when using on @-@ screen display , a preview of the O@@ SD is displayed and you can view the effect of all settings in this preview directly .
the first option is the font . click Select ... to select from the dialog the desired font for the O@@ SD . the check box shadow causes the text to be sh@@ aded in the O@@ SD .
using your own colors gives you the option to customize the O@@ SD colors for font and background . clicking on the color areas opens the dialog to choose color . if you use colors not checked , the pres@@ et &amp; k@@ de colors will be used .
the display text input field displays the text displayed in the O@@ SD . by entering plac@@ eholders , the O@@ SD can be adjusted to your own needs . below is a list of available plac@@ eholders and what they mean .
the screen option is intended for X@@ iner@@ ama users , so you can specify on which screen of a multi @-@ monitor environment the O@@ SD should appear .
the card audio output lets you select an audio driver from the drop @-@ down box . some drivers still activate more adjustment possibilities in this card card .
the collection card collection is used to set all settings for your collection . this includes the folder and the type of the database for the collection .
here you can select the folder , the &amp; Amar@@ ok ; search for music files . to include a folder in the collection , select the check box next to its name . this section also contains check boxes to insert , how to proceed with the selected folders .
Browse sub@@ folders recur@@ sively : this causes &amp; Amar@@ ok ; both the selected and their sub@@ folders will be searched for music .
monitor changes : enables &amp; Amar@@ ok ; to monitor the selected folders on changes ( e.g. if music files are added or deleted ) . an incre@@ mental search is also carried out to make the necessary changes to your collection .
import play@@ lists : causes &amp; Amar@@ ok ; add all found play@@ lists to your collection folders ( .@@ pl@@ s- and .@@ m@@ 3@@ u files ) to your collection . the automatically added play@@ lists will appear later in the playlist browser .
the part collection database is used to select a database for the collection . the combination field driver : lets you choose between SQ@@ Lite or My@@ S@@ q@@ l . if My@@ S@@ q@@ l is selected , further setup is necessary in the My@@ S@@ q@@ l sub@@ window .
the My@@ S@@ q@@ l setup section is used to set up the database for &amp; Amar@@ ok . under computer : enter the host on which the My@@ S@@ q@@ l database is located . after that , the network port is entered under which the database is accessible . name : is the database name to which the connection is established .
use User@@ name : and Password : to enter the data you need to connect to the database .
the last@@ .@@ f@@ m card card supports the support for last@@ .@@ f@@ m . &amp; Amar@@ ok ; can transmit the names of played pieces to a last@@ .@@ f@@ m server and create music recommendations regarding the current piece if required .
here you enter your user name and password for your Last@@ .@@ f@@ m profile . if you do not have a profile , you can register on the last@@ .@@ f@@ m website .
send played pieces and so update the profile : this setting allows it &amp; Amar@@ ok ; to transmit the names of the played pieces to your last@@ .@@ f@@ m profile .
retrieve similar performers : after activating this setting , you can retrieve a list of similar performers to the played piece . you can view the list in the context browser . note : you do not need a last@@ .@@ f@@ m profile to use this function .
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; is an audio player for Unix systems ( such as &amp; z@@ b ; Linux ) . for more information , see the summary of the functions and the gallery with screen@@ shots .
Amar@@ ok only needs the package k@@ deli@@ bs and otherwise no other K@@ DE packages . you have to have k@@ deli@@ bs so installed ( including the included programs , because &amp; Amar@@ ok ; requires some of them to find e.g. modules or scripts ) . we have written a small guide how to build k@@ deli@@ bs minim@@ ally .
some features such as the O@@ SD require your window manager to keep the relevant standards of fre@@ ed@@ es@@ k@@ top@@ .org . Gn@@ ome will work , but flu@@ x@@ box will work for example . we try to support Amar@@ ok on all platforms , so we use k@@ deli@@ bs and Q@@ t because they provide an excellent development environment .
probably one of your files will make an error in the Tag@@ Li@@ b library . you can locate the file by scanning in ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / Amar@@ ok / collection _ sc@@ an@@ .@@ log . please report this error to the Tag@@ li@@ b developers at bu@@ gs@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org and also app@@ end the broken file that caused the crash .
in most cases , it is because tag@@ li@@ b crashes while reading the met@@ a @-@ info from this file . please report this error to the Tag@@ li@@ b developers at bu@@ gs@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org .
if you use MySQL as a database , try SQ@@ Lite . the support for this in &amp; Amar@@ ok ; is somewhat mature .
make sure all of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; used libraries were compiled with the same comp@@ iler version . if e.g. &amp; Amar@@ ok ; with G@@ CC 3.4 , Tag@@ Li@@ b was compiled with G@@ CC 3.@@ 3.@@ X , then this leads to crashes when editing met@@ a information .
if you use K@@ DE with ar@@ ts@@ d , then disable automatic . turn off when in@@ active for ... in setting up the sound system , or at least do not use any value of 1 second .
you can also send us the back@@ trace by e @-@ mail ( the e @-@ mail opens automatically during a crash ) . if it is a frequent crash and you send us a good back@@ trace , the error will be fixed .
this is because many programs write data as U@@ TF @-@ 8 into the met@@ a @-@ info , but don &apos;t label it as Uni@@ code . the following Perl script fixes the problem .
# ! / usr / bin / per@@ l the &quot; The file $ AR@@ GV &#91; 0 &#93; does not exist &quot; unless -@@ f $ AR@@ GV &#91; 0 &#93; ; my $ v@@ 2@@ tag = $ mp@@ 3- &gt; get _ v@@ 2@@ tag ; print &quot; Error in writing the tags of $ AR@@ GV &#91; 0 &#93; \ &quot; unless $ mp@@ 3- &gt; set _ v@@ 2@@ tag ( $ v@@ 2@@ tag , amp ; U@@ TF@@ 8 ) ;
this script requires the Perl module MP3 : : M@@ p@@ li@@ b . it can be re@@ installed with this command : Perl -@@ M@@ CP@@ AN -@@ e &apos;@@ install MP3 : : M@@ p@@ li@@ b &apos;
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; s symbols in the status bar ( random mode / repeat / dynamic playlist ) are always active in K@@ DE 3.@@ 4.0 . sometimes the symbol effects are easily forgotten . note that in some cases you have to click on a icon for up to three times until this setting shows its effect .
if you get this error : amar@@ ok@@ app : symbol look@@ up error : amar@@ ok@@ app : un@@ defined symbol : _ Z@@ N@@ 11@@ K@@ System@@ Tra@@ y@@ 9@@ set@@ pix@@ map , then check if Amar@@ ok uses the correct Q@@ t library . this can be viewed with ld@@ d &apos;@@ which amar@@ ok@@ app &apos; _ BA@@ R _ gre@@ p q@@ t .
to fix this error , you may need to remove any col@@ li@@ ding Q@@ t version or modify / etc / ld@@ .@@ so@@ .@@ conf to find the correct version first .
there are some possibilities . most installation problems are most easily resolved by the help of an expert for your Unix or Linux distribution . you can also search for help with other users or developers . use the forum and IR@@ C under ir@@ c.@@ fre@@ en@@ o@@ de@@ .net in the channel # Amar@@ ok .
Bug@@ z@@ illa is not suitable for help . please enter there only one error if you find something about fixing a bug in Amar@@ ok itself .
after the start of &amp; Amar@@ ok , only a blank playlist appears . how do music pieces enter there now ?
this is simple . use the file browser on the left and open the desired folder . then drag the files to the right part of the playlist .
in order to keep the surface intui@@ tively , the Start sub@@ window was converted into the Statistics window . you can find it under Extras Statistics .
the meaning of these symbols has changed with Amar@@ ok 1.4 Fast For@@ ward : stars stand for the rating by the user while the points are automatically calculated .
to evaluate pieces , the rating column must be displayed in the playlist . click on the playlist of the playlist and select column Show rating . click anywhere in the new review column to specify the rating for a piece . you can also use the short commands Windows + &#91; 1 @-@ 5 &#93; . this also works when Amar@@ ok is in the background .
select the files you want to remove and then press Del on your keyboard . or click with the right mouse button on your selection and then select From Play@@ list Rem@@ ove from the drop @-@ down menu .
drag a playlist file to the playlist with the mouse and drop it there , just like you would do with other files . it &apos;s as simple as that : - )
in the toolbar of the playlist , directly next to the addition button , you can save the Play@@ list button . click on it .
probably the program x@@ mm@@ s @-@ config is missing . install the x@@ mm@@ s @-@ de@@ vel package and install &amp; Amar@@ ok ; new . also look for lib@@ visual , this package contains many very nice visu@@ aliz@@ ations .
the E@@ quali@@ zer can be found in the context menu ( via the right mouse button ) . furthermore , you can find it via the menu bar under Extras E@@ quali@@ zer ....
no ! yes , that &apos;s true ! no ! &amp; Amar@@ ok ; uses a back@@ end independent approach , so the real question must be What media types support G@@ Stre@@ amer / x@@ ine / Arts / N@@ MM / MAS / K@@ DE@@ mm ? . as you can see , we support almost any imagin@@ able audio format .
it can ! maybe you will use F@@ ed@@ ora / Red Hat Linux , which will not include MP3 decoder in default ( for patent reasons ) . the solution : Alt @-@ F@@ 2 , gg : Red@@ Hat mp3 k@@ de , Enter key
start the Ya@@ ST Online Update and install the &apos; Multimedia Option Pack 1 &apos; . well ... &amp; Amar@@ ok ; play MP3 &apos;s from : - )
when using the G@@ Stre@@ amer driver with the Al@@ sa sink , the device must deliver a mixer . a mixer enables multiple applications to use the device at the same time and simultaneously output audio . this can be achieved through a sound card with hardware mixer ( e.g. S@@ B@@ Live ) or through the d@@ mix module for Al@@ sa ( software mixer ) .
the output of this command should help you find the problem cause and a solution . for G@@ Stre@@ amer you may need to specify another sink ( e.g. os@@ s@@ sink ) .
do not forget that media must be deco@@ ded first . you can not simply send an MP3 to AL@@ SA , you would only listen to a white noise . G@@ Stre@@ amer is the best choice for most people if you are looking for a decoder with little overhead . G@@ Stre@@ amer reads the file , de@@ codes it and sends the PC@@ M data to AL@@ SA . just like X@@ M@@ MS .
X@@ M@@ MS also de@@ codes the data first . G@@ Stre@@ amer can output directly to AL@@ SA , just like x@@ ine .
use either the G@@ Stre@@ amer driver ( really great ! ) or optimize the settings of Arts . open Control Center Sound &amp; Multimedia Sound System . enable sound server with highest possible priority ( real @-@ time priority ) and increase the size of sound buffer ( warning , see next point of the FAQ ! ) . make sure ar@@ ts@@ wra@@ pper SU@@ ID is set :
with K@@ DE 3.@@ 2.@@ x there are problems with K@@ DE@@ multimedia code@@ cs that can cause disturbed playback . read this error report . enlar@@ ging the sound buffer in your AL@@ SA setting file .@@ as@@ o@@ und@@ r@@ c can also help well .
either do not use the Arts Driver , but instead use G@@ Stre@@ amer or x@@ ine , or install K@@ DE multimedia to get the faster Arts code@@ cs ( li@@ bar@@ ts _ mp@@ eg@@ li@@ b.@@ so &amp; etc ; ) .
use another driver ( the x@@ ine driver has been strongly optimized for Analy@@ zer ) , or decrease the size of the Arts buffer in control center and sound &amp; multimedia , sound system .
G@@ Stre@@ amer is installed , but if I want to switch to the G@@ Stre@@ amer driver , crashes &amp; Amar@@ ok ; ex . why ?
after installing G@@ Stre@@ amer , you need to register all components . follow the follow @-@ up register to register all the G@@ Stre@@ amer components .
read the G@@ Stre@@ amer FAQ . if that doesn &apos;t help , you can also ask the IR@@ C channel # G@@ Stre@@ amer .
try this ( quit Amar@@ ok before ! ) : - Download and install ff@@ m@@ peg , compile and install it . then run all ff@@ m@@ peg files in the G@@ Stre@@ amer module folder ( you will find the module folder with the latest @-@ config / G@@ Stre@@ amer @-@ config ) and execute the follow @-@ up list again .
if you have a complete list of suggestions / wishes , please send it to our mailing list : Amar@@ ok @-@ de@@ vel @ list@@ s.@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net .
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; is an album by the British Mike Old@@ field . I like it very much and find that the name sounds good . furthermore , the name contains the magic K ... : )
thanks to D@@ CO@@ P , this is already possible . set an alarm in your calendar program and let the alarm run this command : d@@ co@@ p Amar@@ ok player play
this command lets &amp; Amar@@ ok ; start playback . make sure that &amp; Amar@@ ok ; runs before you go to bed , then you are awak@@ ened by the gentle tones of the music that you have stopped before going to bed .
how to find the current in &amp; Amar@@ ok ; running titles when you &apos;re on another computer ?
if a working SSH environment is present , you can proceed as follows . this command will give you interpreter and title of the running piece : SSH -@@ i ~ / .@@ ss@@ h / id _ r@@ sa ih@@ re@@ IP d@@ co@@ p --@@ user ih@@ re@@ use username Amar@@ ok player now@@ Pla@@ ying
replace IP address with your IP and your username with your user name . this assumes that your identification is present in the ~ / .@@ ss@@ h / id _ r@@ sa file .
the visu@@ aliz@@ ations can be separated from the &amp; Amar@@ ok ; window . press d on the keyboard and the current analy@@ zer opens in an independent window in the size .
the combination of C@@ trl + Right mouse button puts a piece in the click sequence into the queue . pressing the Enter key after a search in the playlist will play the first search result and reset the search .
OK , the player window and playlist have tri@@ cky functions , but what about the icon in the system section of the control bar ?
click on the title of a browser . in the context menu you can select which browser should be displayed .
my personal folder $ HO@@ ME is located on a NFS mount . after the start of Amar@@ ok , the collection database cannot be created and many error messages appear on the console .
the internal SQ@@ Lite database of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; does not work with NFS . either you need to link ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / Amar@@ ok to a local drive , or use Amar@@ o@@ ks MySQL support .
insert the CD , then click on audio CD in the menu . it opens a file browser with multiple folders . for normal read@@ out , switch to the wa@@ v folder , select a few pieces and drag them to the desired destination folder in a kon@@ quer@@ or window . for automatic coding , take files from the folders mp3 or o@@ gg instead .

basically this is the previous evaluation with a decreasing value , based on how often the piece was played . the more often the piece was played , the less influence each individual score has on the overall result .
you can enter the rating for a piece by right @-@ clicking on a column header in the playlist window . then you can change the rating of a piece as well as all other attributes , namely by right clicking on the piece and Edit : select review or press F@@ 2 . you can also edit the app@@ rais@@ al in the Met@@ adata dialog .
the developers do not want you to give you when you want to publish a stable version of Amar@@ ok . this means : K@@ DE packages have a fixed publishing plan that is not compatible with the short @-@ term plan of Amar@@ ok .
this is a new feature in Amar@@ ok , which some users can also find annoying . disable the option symbol while playing in the general settings .
the Analy@@ zer is part of the toolbar . select Settings Tool@@ bar ... and take the desired changes there .
download a design , or create your own . then install it under Amar@@ ok ... Ap@@ pear@@ ance Con@@ text Browser design , click New Design Inst@@ all ....
the symbol was similar to the logo of War@@ p Graphics Inc . ( el@@ f@@ qu@@ est@@ .com ) . to avoid difficulties , it was removed .

audio c@@ rob@@ bler is a free service to the information about which pieces are played on an independent server . the service is free and you only need a free username and password . Audi@@ os@@ c@@ rob@@ bler is fully supported by &amp; Amar@@ ok .
if you want to use AL@@ SA , please use the latest available version . old AL@@ SA versions have a lot of crashes and a lot of bug reports .
probably &amp; Amar@@ ok ; compiled before you have installed x@@ ine or G@@ Stre@@ amer . therefore , the . / configure routine does not compile these output modules . you need to configure &amp; install Amar@@ ok ; re@@ configure and install .
now I have &amp; Amar@@ ok ; re @-@ installed , but the output modules still don &apos;t appear . and now ?
you may need to install the G@@ Stre@@ amer @-@ de@@ vel package . the same applies to x@@ ine , you have to install x@@ ine @-@ de@@ vel . after that you must install and install x@@ ine @-@ de@@ vel . after that you need to re@@ compile and install it again .
I get the error G@@ Stre@@ amer @-@ CR@@ IT@@ ICA@@ L * * : factory for &apos; Ad@@ der &apos;s no type .. How can I fix this ?
your version of G@@ Stre@@ amer was compiled with P@@ rel@@ inking , which is in@@ compatible with G@@ Stre@@ amer . you must compile G@@ Stre@@ amer without P@@ rel@@ inking . a tip from mer@@ lin @-@ t@@ c : do not use L@@ DF@@ LA@@ GS if you compile Amar@@ ok .
I get the error message There is no element present to handle the file &apos;s mim@@ et@@ ype audi@@ a / mp@@ 4 , although the module G@@ Stre@@ amer @-@ fa@@ ad is installed .
in order to play mp@@ 4 or m@@ 4@@ a files with G@@ Stre@@ amer , the G@@ Stre@@ amer @-@ quick@@ time module must be installed next to G@@ Stre@@ amer @-@ fa@@ ad .
you will receive the error There is no element present to handle the stream &apos;s mim@@ et@@ ype audio / m@@ peg .
you play an MP3 stream , but the module G@@ Stre@@ amer @-@ mad is not installed . install the module and then run as a system administrator register . then restart Amar@@ ok .
I have a second sound card and use AL@@ SA . how can Amar@@ ok use the second sound card ?
set up in Settings Amar@@ ok ... output audio output to the device . typically , for example h@@ w : 0 for the default sound card and h@@ w : 1 for the second .
here is an example of ~ / .@@ as@@ o@@ und@@ r@@ c on a machine with an onboard AC@@ 97 code@@ c and a USB audio device :
p@@ c@@ m.@@ intel@@ 8@@ x@@ 0 &quot; type plug sla@@ v@@ e.@@ p@@ cm &quot; h@@ w : 0 &quot; c@@ tl@@ .@@ intel@@ 8@@ x@@ 0 { type h@@ w card 0 } p@@ c@@ m.@@ us@@ b @-@ audio { type plug sla@@ v@@ e.@@ p@@ cm &quot; h@@ w : 1 &quot; c@@ tl@@ .@@ us@@ b @-@ audio { type h@@ w card 1 }
enter into the setup dialog from x@@ ine now us@@ b @-@ audio , and the output takes place on the USB sound card . so @-@ li@@ b takes care of the conversion of the sample rate , channels and so on .
if you want to use a virtual d@@ mix device , disable the tick on sound card m@@ map .
we are sorry , but the audio output with Arts is not cared for further . you may naturally like to take this problem by yourself ! if you want , you can become the new so much needed main@@ tain@@ er for Arts : )
listen to music should be quite simple ! for this reason , there is the setup wizard , which will be displayed at the first start of &amp; Amar@@ ok . if you want to update your collection afterwards , or simply don &apos;t like the wizard , then this Quick Start Guide will help you . with your help you will have set up &amp; Amar@@ ok ; in a few minutes .
creating a playlist is very easy . drag items from the collection browser into the playlist . the small text box to filter the collection simpli@@ fies the search for certain pieces . if you are happy with the playlist , you can save them with the help of the button playlist under saved . you will find this button in the toolbar of the playlist window .
if you have your own playlist , you can add it to the playlist browser . if the playlist is included in the folders of your collection , and you have enabled the playlist to import play@@ lists , then these play@@ lists are already in the tree view . with a right click on a playlist , you will receive various ways to load the playlist .
to play an audio CD , please select Ac@@ tions Audio CD in the menu bar . it opens a file browser with multiple folders and CD pieces in WAV format . drag the WAV files into the playlist and then press the Play@@ back button .

&amp; Amar@@ ok ; is a versatile multimedia player . it offers many different ways to keep your music collection under control . as any normal multimedia player has also &amp; Amar@@ ok ; however , a playlist that is superior to all others .
this chapter explains how to use all the functions of &amp; Amar@@ ok , including creating a collection and a playlist .
the Player Window is your one @-@ click &amp; Amar@@ ok ; control center . at the top of the window there is a running text display showing the current piece or current stream . just below is the area , the playing time , bit rate and sam@@ pl@@ er@@ ate of the current play . a click on this area changes the display of the already expi@@ red playing time for the remaining play time of the piece .
in addition , the player window contains a selection of audio analy@@ zers , even under the run text display . you can change through the available analy@@ zers by clicking the left mouse button on the area .

the playlist of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; is the most advanced playlist of all for &amp; k@@ de ; available multimedia players . it has many features that are not available in any other player .
the playlist window can be divided into two main areas , on the left side is the navigation pane . in the navigation pane you will find some of the excellent features of the playlist , such as the context browser . on the right hand side is the playlist itself . the playlist is easy to use and yet even for advanced users Power@@ ful enough .
the context browser displays various information regarding the current play . its appearance can be customized with the help of context browser designs . the context browser contains three sub@@ windows : music , text and performer . these three sub@@ windows will be explained later in detail .
if you have already used earlier versions of &amp; Amar@@ ok , you might notice that the sub@@ window has dropped off . the information displayed there has now been distributed to other parts of &amp; Amar@@ ok . furthermore , the information in the Statistics window can be viewed ( Extras Statistics ) .
the music sub@@ window shows information about the currently running piece , as well as the interpreter and the album .
the first section in this sub@@ window displays information about the piece . in the title is the name of the piece , artist and album . below you can see the cover picture of the album and a Musi@@ c@@ Bra@@ in@@ z icon next to it . click on this icon to look up the piece in the Musi@@ c@@ Bra@@ in@@ z database .
below the Musi@@ c@@ Bra@@ in@@ z symbol you will find more information about the current piece . you can see here how often and when the piece was played for the first and last time as well as its evaluation .
in order to display cover images in the context browser , the cover images must be in the same folder as the current piece . the images can have any names , but pictures with the word &apos; front in the name are treated prefer@@ enti@@ ally . the context browser will also display cover images , which are either downloaded with the cover administration or embedded in ID@@ 3@@ v2 tags .
the next section , Recommen@@ ded pieces , lists several recommended pieces . if you click on any of these pieces , it will be played immediately .
under the Recommen@@ ded pieces you find the favourite pieces of this artist . this area shows the five highest rated pieces of the current interpreter .
you can specify which information to be displayed in the music sub@@ window . right @-@ click anywhere in the sub@@ window and select from the context menu .
the last section , albums of the artist , lists all the albums of the current performer that you have in your collection . if you click on an album , it will work out and you see the album &apos;s content .
you can click on all the pieces in the individual fields to start playing immediately . you can also click on it with the right mouse button and then select one of the options to add the play or album to the playlist from the context menu .
this function is very flexible and it is possible to download text from other web pages with the help of self @-@ written scripts . as soon as you click on the text sub@@ window , try to download the text for the piece from the Internet . if no text script is running , you can choose which to start .
the Edit button allows you to edit the lyrics . the changed version is then stored in &amp; Amar@@ ok ; s collection database . no running text script is required .
the Search button opens a search on goo@@ gle@@ .com after the song text for the running piece ( in an external browser window ) .
group@@ ing interpre@@ ts - only group the top level , each piece is displayed directly below the interpreter . albums or genres are ignored .
group@@ ing Artist / Album - First the pieces are arranged according to the artist and below is a further distribution according to the respective album . if you want to see compositions or sound@@ track albums , this is the best view on your collection - these albums are displayed at the beginning of the list with different performers .
group Interpre@@ t / Year - Album - Sor@@ ted by artist and then after the year of the album in descending order ( latest first ) . if the year is unknown for an album , the default 0 - Alb@@ um@@ name is used .
group@@ ing Album - All albums of your collection are sorted alphabe@@ tically by each other . the artist is ignored .
group@@ ing genre / interpreter - your pieces will first be sorted by genre and among them by artist .
group@@ ing Genre / Artist / Album - This setting works just like the above , but is also sorted according to album below the interpreter .
with the help of the remaining buttons you can customize and combine the group@@ ing at will .
with the last button you can change the settings to the collection . note : &amp; Amar@@ ok ; will automatically capture your collection once you change something at the selected folders . if you own many pieces , it might take a while .
there is a search filter directly below the toolbar . it beha@@ ves in the list view as well as in the tree view . notes on how to use this filter can be found in the section on the playlist in this manual .
under the search filter you will find a selection field with which help you can filter the recently added pieces to your collection . you can also choose between the last 24 hours up to a year . furthermore , you can of course select your entire collection , so that the filter is shut down practically .
by clicking with the right mouse button on an entry in the collection browser , you will receive the following options .
load - This displays the current playlist and inserts the selected pieces in the currently valid order in the playback .
app@@ end to Play@@ list - Ad@@ ds the selected pieces to the current playlist . double @-@ clicking on an entry brings the same effect .
set pieces in queue - This function adds the selected pieces to the queue . this will play you next .
save as a playlist ... - Save the selected pieces as a playlist . you will be asked for a name under which the list should be stored .
transfer to media player - Ad@@ ds the pieces into the queue to transfer to the media player . for more details , see the Media Player browser section .
all pieces of this interpreter are burned / Bur@@ n to CD - This allows the selected pieces to be sent to K@@ 3@@ b and burned either as a data or as audio CD . if K@@ 3@@ b is not installed , this option is not displayed .
edit Met@@ adata ( for n pieces ) ... - open the dialog for piece information and lets you change the tags for one or more pieces .
( s ) Move files to the tr@@ ash bin ... - Open a confirmation dialog . if you confirm this , the selected files will be deleted from your computer .
mark as a compilation - Select the selected album as a compilation , wher@@ eu@@ pon it appears under different interpre@@ ters .
raising the compilation mark - Chan@@ ges a compilation of the selected album back into a normal album . after that , the album is no longer displayed under different performers but again under the respective interpreter .
the play@@ lists browser makes it easy to deal with many play@@ lists . among other things , it also includes Smart Play@@ lists .
the lower part of the playlist browser contains the smart play@@ lists . these util@@ ise &amp; Amar@@ ok ; s built @-@ in database to automatically create some useful play@@ lists at run@@ time . the smart play@@ lists consist of :
never played : a playlist with the pieces in your collection that have never been played .
even created smart play@@ lists are possible . click to add smart playlist to open the dialog to create a new Smart playlist , where you can enter all the necessary criteria for your new playlist .
the media player sub@@ window is used for the connection of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; for example , to use your iPod with &amp; Amar@@ ok ; for example , it must be included before the start of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; in / m@@ nt / i@@ pod . if &amp; Amar@@ ok ; start , you will find the pieces on your iPod to interpre@@ t sorted in the top list view of the Media Player browser .
to transfer pieces to your iPod , drag the desired titles from the playlist and let them fall on the list Artist . if you are done , click Apply . this will upload the pieces to your iPod . if the transmission is completed , quit &amp; Amar@@ ok ; and solve the drive binding for your iPod .
among the toolbar is a search area with which you can search for a file . the search is especially useful in folders with very many files because in the file list all files are hidden , which do not match your search criteria .
in the lower part of the file browser there is an address bar with which you can fetch music from a entered URL . if you enter for example tar : / home / mi@@ ke / musik@@ .@@ tar@@ .@@ g@@ z and press enter key , you can access music in the file musik@@ .@@ tar@@ .@@ g@@ z . now you can drag the music from there into the playlist and drop .
if the playlist is longer than in the window , the attachment of files can be difficult by simply dropping files . in this case , holding down the Shift key can be helpful : by doing so , dropped files will be inserted automatically at the end of the list , and not at the mouse position .
you can change the order by simply drag the entries to the desired position by simply drag the entries into the desired position . once you enter letters there will only be the pieces containing the letters . to reset the filter , press the back button for so long , until the text field is empty again .
if you enter separated search terms by whit@@ esp@@ ace , &amp; Amar@@ ok ; search for entries containing all search terms . for example , if you enter one in two , search will find all entries containing one , two and three .
if you enter the OR search terms , search for entries that contain either one or the other search term . example : one OR 2 OR Three . in this example , all pieces contain one or two or three ( or a combination thereof ) .
if you want to search for entries containing spaces , then en@@ close the search term with go@@ ose feet : Mike Old@@ field . this will search for entries that Mike Old@@ field contains , but not according to entries like Mike J. Old@@ field .
if you specify a particular search column , you may also search for larger or smaller ones . for example : rating : &gt; 50@@ . This searches for pieces that have a higher rating than 50 .
if you want to search for a piece that does not contain a particular search term , set a minus sign in front of the search term : -@@ some search for pieces that do not contain anything .
you can combine these syntax variants at will . example : Mike Old@@ field OR score : &gt; 50 -@@ comment : bad . this searches for all pieces that contain either Mike Old@@ field or a higher rating than 50 and do not contain the comment .
you can specify the sequence of entries by holding down the C@@ trl key and clicking the right mouse button in the desired order . the entries then receive a label with a number . the number corresponds to the order in which the pieces are played .
the toolbar of the playlist is located at the bottom of the window . it contains buttons for some functions of the playlist . on the left , you will find the Add button to add to the playlist .
next , the buttons will follow back and restore , so you can und@@ o or restore any changes to the playlist .
in the middle of the toolbar is a unique magni@@ fying analy@@ zer . the refresh rate can be adjusted with a click of the right mouse button on the Analy@@ zer .
the last button in the toolbar is menu . it opens the same menu as that you get in the player window over the right mouse button . you can set up the configuration via this menu .
there are many more buttons available for the toolbar , for example playback controls and volume control . you can set the displayed buttons by clicking on the menu and setting up tool bars ... Select .
the status bar gives you a quick overview of useful information about the playlist . it displays the title of the current play , the number of pieces and the total play time of all pieces . furthermore , the status for random mode and retri@@ eval , a sli@@ der for playback position and playing time of the current play is displayed .
you can also hide the status bar . to do this , disable the status bar option in the general settings .
the context menu can be reached by clicking with the right mouse button in the player window , or by clicking in the playlist on the menu . you can reach the settings of &amp; Amar@@ ok via this menu .

with the View menu you can choose what to display in the cover administration . select from :
queue management received your big move in &amp; Amar@@ ok ; 1.3 . with this feature , you still have more control over the playlist . after you set a piece into the queue , in the playlist appears a number next to the title . this number represents the order in which &amp; Amar@@ ok ; the pieces will play : 1 is played first , 2 as second , and so on .
when you want to add a piece to the queue , select the piece in the playlist and then click + . you can also easily add the pieces to the mouse or use the context menu in the playlist . you can then change the order of the pieces in the queue management .

c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia : a program for reading digital audio from a CD ( CD@@ DA - Compact Disc Digital Audio ) . on the Internet , such programs are commonly referred to as ri@@ ppers .
O@@ GG Vor@@ bis Library : O@@ GG Vor@@ bis is a completely open , patent @-@ free and professional technology for audio encoding and for dealing with audio data streams . O@@ GG Vor@@ bis benefits from open source and stands in direct competition to MP3 . this library is used by the O@@ gg Vor@@ bis de@@ oder@@ - and encoder modules .
M@@ ad : it is a high quality MPEG Audio decoder . it currently supports MPEG @-@ 1 , MPEG @-@ 2 and MPEG 2.5 . all three audio layers Layer I , Layer II , and Layer III ( e.g. MP3 ) are fully supported . this library is used by the MP3 decoder module .
l@@ ame : a widely developed MP3 decoder that can compete in terms of quality and speed with commercial enco@@ ders . l@@ ame is used by the MP3 encoder module .
FLA@@ C : a free open source code@@ c for los@@ s@@ less audio compression and de@@ compression . it is used by the FLA@@ C decoder module and the external audio encoder module , so you can read and write FLA@@ C files .
li@@ bs@@ n@@ d@@ file , FF@@ MPEG , FLA@@ C , Mus@@ ep@@ ack Decoder : other libraries for processing different audio formats . with FF@@ MPEG , for example , it is possible to de@@ cryp@@ t WMA files to burn them to an audio CD . de@@ co
SO@@ X : a utility that can convert and convert between different audio formats . SO@@ X is used by the So@@ X Audio En@@ co@@ der module .
trans@@ code : a command @-@ line program for video editing . you need it when you want to read a DVD .
V@@ C@@ DI@@ ma@@ ger : a full featured auth@@ oring system for editing , dis@@ assembling and analy@@ zing video CDs and super video CDs .
norm@@ alize : this tool is used to adjust the volume of music files to a standard level . this can be useful e.g. for creating mixed CD &apos;s and M@@ p@@ 3 collections ; without Norm@@ alize , the different recording levels of the different albums can lead to the un@@ attractive effect that the music pieces are played differently .
e@@ Mo@@ vi@@ x : this is a very small Linux distribution . it contains the necessary software to start from CD and automatically play all videos in the base folder of the CD .
this is a convenient way to re@@ charge recently opened projects . the associated sub@@ menu contains a list of these projects . clicking on an entry will open the project .
save the current project . if the project has been saved once , the previously created file will be over@@ written , otherwise it will be asked for a new fil@@ en@@ ame .
save the current project under a new fil@@ en@@ ame . K@@ DE &apos;s dialog Save As you can select folder and file name for the project file .
saves all opened projects . that is the same as if you would call for each individual project file saving .
closes the current project . if a project has been modified and not yet saved , ask &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; after what is to happen . you can then choose between saving and change . furthermore , you can also cancel the closing and keep the project open .
closes all open projects . &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; will ask for any non @-@ saved project what to do with it , just as if you had called for each project file closing .
closes all opened projects and ends &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; . for any un@@ saved project it is asked what to do with it as if you had called file closing .
when you call this entry , you can select files to add to the project via the appearing dialog . this has the same effect as if you select the files directly from the top view into the project view . if the current project is a data CD , the added files will appear in the base folder of the CD .
this dialog is basically the same as the Properties dialog of the project . the only difference is the additional button burning , the &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; to burn the medium . the burning dialog can only be opened when the project already contains data .
opens the Properties dialog for the current project . here you can make many project related settings . each project type has different possible settings , most of them are described via the What is the ? help ( accessible via the right mouse button ) .
this entry will only appear on an active data CD / DVD or video DVD project . it causes &amp; k@@ 3@@ b to import files from a previous session into the current project . this is useful when you create files for a multi @-@ session CD . this is useful for you , even if this function is not used . it is intended for you rather than help so that you can view the files and folders already available on the media .
this entry will only appear on an active data CD / DVD or video DVD project . this function causes &amp; k@@ 3@@ b to remove imported files from the current project . all other files remain in the project .
this allows you to create only one image from a CD , which you can then burn later . also , there is also the possibility of cl@@ oning instead of the normal copy . you should prefer cl@@ oning if you want to copy CDs with defective sectors or video CDs .
this also allows you to create only one image from a DVD , which you can then burn later . also , there is also the possibility of cl@@ oning instead of the normal copying . also , there is also the possibility of cl@@ oning instead of the normal copying . the converting / reduction of a DVD with the help of the copy @-@ dialogue is not yet supported , so the target medium must be large enough to record the entire ( video ) data of the source medium in the original form .
open the dialog to delete a CD @-@ RW . this allows you to delete all contents or parts of a CD @-@ RW .
open the dialog to format a DVD . with this dialog you can format a DVD Â± R ( W ) , whereby the contents will be completely er@@ ased .
the dialog asks you for a * .@@ is@@ o , * .@@ cue or * .@@ to@@ c file as a data source , which can then be burned immediately by pressing the burning button . ( Ner@@ o * .@@ n@@ r@@ g files are currently not supported , but you need to use other tools such as N@@ r@@ g@@ 2@@ I@@ so . )
the dialog asks you for a * .@@ is@@ o file as a data source , which can then be fired inst@@ ant@@ an@@ e@@ ously by pressing the burning button .
this dialog window usually appears after reading a DVD in the table of contents , but can also be used all @-@ in . it contains information about the selected video , encoding settings and even possibilities for changing size and trimm@@ ing black edges .
displays information about the inserted medium . this information is displayed in the table of contents and contains properties of the medium , such as size and title length of the CD or DVD .
displays a list of tool bars of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; when an entry is selected , the toolbar is currently visible in the main window .
if this is checked , a small bar is displayed at the bottom of the window . it contains information about the status of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; and its activities . if this is not checked , the status bar is hidden .
the folder view includes an overview of your folders and CD / DVD drives . if the contents view is enabled , their contents will be displayed in the table of contents . CD / DVD drives also have a context menu with functions such as media info , locks and unlock the drive or ej@@ ection of the medium .
the table of contents enables selecting and dra@@ gging files into the project view . the table of contents is also the interface to read audio or video CDs if a drive has been selected with a corresponding CD / DVD in the folder view .
the head strip is a narrow area that is only visible when the project view contains open projects . the head@@ line does not have a real function , it only looks pretty and separates the projection view clearly from the rest of the views .
this opens a dialog window to modify the key assignments for &amp; k@@ 3@@ b . after selecting one of the available commands in the upper part , you can adjust the key assignments for it further down .
this will start the k@@ 3@@ b ; setup wizard . this allows you to set the correct auth@@ oriz@@ ations for burning CDs and DVDs . therefore , you need to enter the password for the system administrator ( root ) when the wizard is started .
opens the settings of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; here general program settings can be done . almost all functions of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; should work at startup . this dialog is intended for person@@ al@@ ising and fine adjustment of the program .
&amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; is , like many other &amp; k@@ not ; applications also equipped with a &amp; D@@ CO@@ P interface . with the help of this interface , parts of the functionality can be controlled for example via a shell script .
to use the &amp; D@@ CO@@ P functions , you can either use the command line program d@@ co@@ p , or the more convenient program K@@ d@@ co@@ p . both programs are identical in the range of functions , so your taste and type of task is critical , which of the contribut@@ or programs give you a preference .
in this chapter , we assume that you use the command line program d@@ co@@ p . to use the &amp; D@@ CO@@ P functions , you must first make sure that &amp; k@@ 3@@ b is started . then enter something like the following at the console :
besides the general &amp; D@@ CO@@ P ; functions that all &amp; k@@ de ; program have in common , supported &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; mainly two additional parts described below .
the Standard D@@ CO@@ P interface of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b provides features such as copy@@ cd , format DVD and other functions for creating new projects .
D@@ CO@@ P@@ Re@@ f cre@@ ate@@ Video DV@@ D@@ Project ( ) D@@ CO@@ P@@ Re@@ f cre@@ ate@@ Video DV@@ D@@ Project ( ) D@@ CO@@ P@@ Re@@ f cre@@ ate@@ Video DV@@ D@@ Project ( ) D@@ CO@@ P@@ Re@@ f cre@@ ate@@ Video DV@@ D@@ Project ( ) void format@@ D@@ v@@ d ( ) void bur@@ n@@ C@@ d@@ Image ( ) void bur@@ n@@ d@@ image ( ) void bur@@ n@@ d@@ image ( K@@ URL ur@@ l ) void bur@@ n@@ d@@ image ( K@@ URL ur@@ l )
as a result of such a cre@@ ate@@ XX@@ X@@ Project method you get a D@@ CO@@ P reference to the newly created project : D@@ CO@@ P@@ Re@@ f ( k@@ 3@@ b , K@@ 3@@ b@@ Project @-@ 0 ) Altern@@ atively you can create a project using the command line : # k@@ 3@@ b --@@ audi@@ oc@@ de and then get a reference to the project using # d@@ co@@ p k@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b@@ Interface curr@@ ent@@ Project By using this reference it is possible to modify the project via K@@ 3@@ b@@ Proj@@ ect@@ Interface .
K@@ 3@@ b offers the above K@@ 3@@ b@@ Proj@@ ect@@ Interface and the powerful K@@ 3@@ b@@ Data@@ Proj@@ ect@@ Interface , which can only be applied to data projects ( CD and DVD ) :
void Cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der ( Q@@ string name ) void add@@ Ur@@ ls ( Q@@ string name , Q@@ string parent ) void add@@ ur@@ ls ( Q@@ string path ) void ren@@ am@@ e@@ It@@ em ( Q@@ string path , Q@@ string New@@ Name ) void set@@ Volum@@ e@@ ID ( Q@@ string id )
this makes it possible to fill out a data project with files and folders from a script . for example , the following script creates a data project , several folders and then inserts files into the new folder :
# ! / bin / b@@ ash PRO@@ J@@ ECT = $ ( d@@ co@@ p k@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b interface cre@@ ate@@ Data@@ CD@@ Project ) d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ ECT cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der fo@@ o d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ ECT cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der bar / fo@@ o d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ ECT add@@ Ur@@ l / home / tru@@ eg / som@@ ef@@ il@@ e.@@ txt / fo@@ o / bar
&amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; is an audio CD ; -@@ les@@ bian for &amp; k@@ de ; . with it can easily be read audio CD ; s can be read and stored in MP3 or O@@ GG files . also other formats are possible , depending on encoder that is installed on the machine .
&amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; is the interface of c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia ( for reading &amp; CD ; data in WAV files on hard disk ) and by many enco@@ ders that enco@@ des these WAV files ( these enco@@ ders must still be installed from the Linux distribution ) . more enco@@ ders can be added to the program ( if they have been installed ) .
first the titles of the &amp; CD ; read out and stored in WAV files on the computer ( los@@ s@@ less and compressed ) ; and then
in a second step these WAV files ( usually one per title ) are compressed into the mp3 or O@@ GG format or in other formats like the los@@ s@@ less FLA@@ C .
for the first step , reading the &amp; CD ; , is used by &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia . almost every distribution has compiled a pre @-@ compiled package ; if this is not yet installed , this needs to be done now .
for the second step , l@@ ame ( for MP3 ) , o@@ gg@@ vor@@ bis ( for O@@ GG ) or other enco@@ ders must be installed . all these programs are usually installed for any Linux distri@@ butions , so it is very likely not necessary to install something yourself .
which coding / file format should be used ? the chapter Wel@@ cher Ko@@ di@@ erer gives a small introduction about enco@@ ders , audio quality and compression factors .
a word to copy protected audio CD ; s : as already said , used &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia to read the audio data from the &amp; CD ; if not the firmware of the &amp; CD ; / DVD device can handle protection , it is not possible to b@@ ypass any copy@@ righ@@ ted audio CD ; just avoid buying copied audio CD ; s !
while setting up only needs to be done once ( the setup dialog can be called up so often until a suitable configuration is found ) , the daily handling for reading a &amp; CD will be explained . this ( hopefully ) leads to an understanding of the lean approach of the user interface that you frequently stum@@ ble across at the beginning .
can convert into many formats - depending on which enco@@ ders are installed ( MP3 , O@@ GG , FLA@@ C &amp; etc ; )
can &amp; CD ; get information from the fre@@ ed@@ b from the internet or can work completely without a network , with everything being manually collected .
this is just a short list of the main window commands . step by step , for example , you will find more information about how this program is used , as well as screen photos with descriptions of the tabs for configur@@ ing the program .
starts the CD@@ DB request of the CD data according to the setup of request in the CD@@ DB tab . ( this may be local or online , in the latter case the connection to the Internet must first be established . )
start reading and - if a encoder has been configured in the Device Code tab - encoding .
opens a sub @-@ menu with a list of available enco@@ ders so that the selection can be read with another encoder when the default configuration dialog is configured .
opens the file manager so that an already selected file will be selected for encoding instead of a full &amp; CD ; read and code .
opens the setup dialog to configure the type of notification ( such as logs , spa@@ des ) for program events ( such as reading the &amp; CD ; finished ) .
opens the main setup dialog from &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; with different card cards ( such as En@@ co@@ der , for setting up the encoder ) . here you have to go before the program can be used successfully !
this chapter describes audio quality , enco@@ ders and compression ratios and helps you choose the right encoding .
if no audio information is to be lost , a los@@ s@@ less audio format is required . besides FLA@@ C there are also other like &apos; shor@@ ten &apos; or &apos; monkey &apos; that may be available for this distribution . the disadvantages are the low compression rates and hardly available commercial devices that can play these files .
among the audio formats that lose information through data compression according to their psycho@@ acoustic model , MP3 and O@@ GG are the most common . O@@ GG may today have a slight advantage over MP3 in audio quality at lower bit@@ rates ( up to 128 k@@ bps ) , but above this bit@@ rate , the differences are less important since both enco@@ ders produce very good audio quality .
O &apos; not so &apos; free , l@@ ame will still be supplied with most distri@@ butions for free , but there are open license questions
+ high to very high sound quality ( at high bit@@ rates ) , but compared to O@@ GG slightly deeper quality at lower bit@@ rates .
O@@ GG - if only music is to be heard from a computer or a computer based music system and / or if one of the few existing O@@ GG play@@ sets exists .
MP3 - if music is also to be listened to on other devices , such as standard DVD players , portable devices ( USB stick , memory card , hard disk ) or special auto stereo systems . today - initially 2009 - these devices usually only support MP3 format .
a short list of parameters for audio quality and the resulting compression ratios for &apos; l@@ ame &apos; ( MP@@ 3@@ s ) ( see &apos; l@@ ame --@@ help &apos; for more parameters ) :
&apos;@@ --@@ pres@@ et medium &apos; = This setting gives good transparency for most people and most of the music
&apos;@@ --@@ pres@@ et standard &apos; = this setting should usually offer acceptable transparency for most people and most music pieces , and has quite high quality . good enough for hi @-@ fi stereo systems with high quality .
&apos;@@ --@@ pres@@ et extreme &apos; = 2@@ 24 to 256 k@@ bps V@@ BR , compression rate up to 6.3 . needs up to 320 k@@ bps for complex music pieces and a little less for less complex parts of the piece . good enough for hi @-@ fi stereo systems with high quality . this is the preferred choice .
&apos;@@ --@@ pres@@ et extreme -@@ b 256 &apos; = 256 k@@ bps C@@ BR , compression rate around 5.5 . requires always 256 k@@ bps for complex and less complex pieces of a title . some older devices need C@@ BR@@ s . good enough for hi @-@ fi stereo systems with high quality .
&apos; -@@ h &apos; = 128 k@@ bps C@@ BR common stereo , compression rate around 11 . 128 k@@ bps for all songs of a title . good enough for music of young people , portable devices and auto@@ stere@@ os . but not good enough for better HiFi stereo systems .
&apos;@@ --@@ pres@@ et In@@ san@@ e &apos; = 3@@ 20@@ k@@ bps C@@ BR . this setting will be over@@ done for most people and most environments , but if you absolutely want to have the absolutely highest quality without regard to the file size , then choose this setting .
the &amp; CD ; information retri@@ eved manually or automatically fet@@ ched from the fre@@ ed@@ b via the Internet are available in the program as a list of parameters . you can hand over / use with &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; and the encoding program to create the folder and file names as well as the properties of the music files .
in connection with coding programs , there is often a combination of program settings for the enco@@ ders and these parameters here . the manual or the help to the enco@@ ders explain the switches for these programs .
for example to add the &amp; CD ; Tit@@ le to the keywords ( English : day ) if MP@@ 3@@ s are enco@@ ded with l@@ ame , the switch -@@ t@@ t from l@@ ame and the title parameter of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator must be added . the result looks like &apos; ... -@@ t@@ t { title } ... &apos; .
this is a summary of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; parameters that can be used ( = button identi@@ fier in the wizard ) :
this is what the fre@@ ed@@ b is : a free database where people can read the audio CDs that can download information instead of entering the computer . it is to be noted that only text is spoken : &amp; CD ; Tit@@ le , Artist , Name of the pieces &amp; etc ; , not from the audio file itself .
yes , it should be legal , but I ( note of the translator ) am not a lawyer . however , no one can prevent that you from the &amp; CD ; information released publicly on CD ; more or less worth@@ less , so neither the artist nor the music company can be har@@ med . all information can be obtained anyway with a stroll through a &amp; CD ; business , physical or virtual .
in &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; is actively to select a check box ( sending an address ) . in this mode of configuration , it seems , the email address is not used when retri@@ eving the data from the server ( This can only know the programmer who has verified the code . )
there are copies of the main database in many countries . if &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; to use fre@@ ed@@ b , the ge@@ ographi@@ cally closest mirror server is to be used . this saves bandwidth in the network and balances the load between the hosts .
a visit to fre@@ ed@@ b@@ .org provides a current list of mirror servers for the online retri@@ eval of &amp; CD ; information during reading a &amp; CD ; alternatively the complete database can be downloaded or ( usually created monthly ) only the updates of the database .
which reading program is used to store plays from the &amp; CD ; in WAV files on my computer ?
there are rum@@ ors that c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia is used ; if you want to know more precisely , look for the source code .... This has always been the best choice for reading audio CD ; s . note that the c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia package must first be installed from the appropriate distribution if this has not happened yet .
to save the read WAV files , the encoder and the desired file format can be selected . the first opening contains pre@@ defined entries for l@@ ame ( MP@@ 3@@ s ) , o@@ ggen@@ c ( O@@ g@@ gs ) and FLA@@ C ( a los@@ s@@ less compression for audio data ) on the encoder tab . other enco@@ ders can be added on this tab .
the encoder package must be installed by the Linux distribution concerned before the encoder can be used . this is also required for the pre@@ defined enco@@ ders . for more information on Ko@@ di@@ erer , please refer to the chapter Wel@@ cher Ko@@ di@@ erer .
after installing a encoder , you can get more information about your switch by entering a command such as l@@ ame -@@ help or l@@ ame --@@ help in a console window ( eg ; console ) .
this can have many causes . check the device name of the &amp; CD ; / DVD disk , write and write permission on it and whether both c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia and the audio encoder of your choice ( l@@ ame for MP@@ 3@@ s , o@@ ggen@@ c for O@@ g@@ gs , fla@@ c &amp; etc ; ) are installed .
check if you don &apos;t want a copy @-@ protected audio CD ; check out the envelope of the &amp; CD ; this will not succeed !
there is a chapter with a step by step example . even if you use other settings , this can give tips on how to proceed .
have you read the complete manual , understood all , are somehow still unsure what to do ? well , no problem , follow this step @-@ by @-@ step example , and you will get enough information to set up those areas that make the program exactly what you want .
in this example , we will launch the program for the first time , set up everything and read our first &amp; CD ; we will use l@@ ame &apos; --@@ pres@@ et extreme &apos; to generate MP@@ 3@@ s with a V@@ BR ( variable bit@@ rate ) from 2@@ 24 to 256 k@@ bps on average and ID@@ 3@@ V@@ 1 keyword ( tags ) .
there must be c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia and l@@ ame already installed on your computer . both programs should be available as pre @-@ compiled packages for your Linux distribution . for example , a suitable package for l@@ ame can be found with a search engine as it is not fully free software . anyway , it is not necessary to compile the source files , which you can always do .
please make sure that the / usr / share / cd directory exists and that you have write permission ( eg by trying to copy something inside with the kon@@ quer@@ or ) .
the first section covers basic setup of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; something that is probably done only once and
the second section describes how to read a &amp; CD ; what needs to be repeated for each CD ;
here we define the enco@@ ders to be used ( l@@ ame ) as well as the audio format ( MP3 ) as well as the resulting sound quality ( --@@ pres@@ et extreme = &gt; V@@ BR 2@@ 24 to 256 k@@ bps ) .
although we can change these settings at any time , we will probably not change them on any read out of a &amp; CD ; change if once the appropriate settings are found .
the device name is passed to the selection program so it can read the &amp; CD ; -@@ data / pieces .
often / dev / c@@ drom is a symbolic link to the actual device identi@@ fier of your disk . if this does not work or if more than one &amp; CD ; / DVD drive is available , a look into the file / etc / f@@ stab and an attempt with the existing entries of device desig@@ nations for CD &amp; CD @-@ ROM ; and / or DVD drives .
the tab General Settings . there is not much to do here . here an additional conversion can be defined . in our example , everything is displayed as shown in the screen@@ shot .
select only for incomplete information , so that you will be informed when information about creating keywords ( tags ) is missing .
the card card CD ; Settings . simply select both entries . we are comfortable and let the &amp; CD ; data automatically download via the internet from a fre@@ ed@@ b calcul@@ ator .
note : the computer must be connected to the fre@@ ed@@ b server while reading the &amp; CD .
the second selection field is easier , is a &amp; CD ; entry found , immediately starts reading the &amp; CD ; it is associated with low risk , if you are later un@@ happy with the database entry and the resulting directory names / fil@@ en@@ ames or tag entries , they can be easily changed . the directory or fil@@ en@@ ame is changed with Kon@@ quer@@ or - &gt; Ren@@ ame , and the ID@@ 3 tags with K@@ id@@ 3 , the &amp; k@@ de ; Tag@@ ger .
apart from this example , keep in mind : if you want to manually enter everything manually , disable the selection fields and fre@@ ed@@ b will not be used . however , this is over 6@@ 20 MB big , consider this twice whether this is worth it . to use fre@@ ed@@ b in offline mode , the two sel@@ ections must be selected , at least the first .
CD@@ DB is fre@@ ed@@ b for us . these are settings for the data request , for retri@@ eving the &amp; CD ; information from the fre@@ ed@@ b server over the Internet . how does the system know which data to get the CD ? read the fre@@ ed@@ b section .
mode : we did not download the database , we only want to work with the remote database on the Internet server .
CD@@ DB server : please go to fre@@ ed@@ b@@ .org and look for a mirror server close by . on this way , the load is distributed between the hosts . however , this setting will work as the first attempt .
both function equivalent to the server , but since many fire@@ walls are bo@@ cking the protocol 88@@ 80 by default , there might be more luck with the protocol 80 , since the HTTP protocol is usually open to surf the Internet .
in this example , we don &apos;t want to transfer data to the fre@@ ed@@ b server . de@@ activate the first check box should suff@@ ice .
just take the settings from the screen@@ shot . ( make sure the / tmp folder exists on your computer )
number of simultaneously matching pieces : sorry , there is one reason why more than one at the same time with only one existing drive ? parallel reading and coding ? the author doesn &apos;t know , so simply try it yourself .
CD ; disc@@ ard after reading the last piece : check this to check the CD ; at the end of the process .
custom folder for temporary files : if you tick this , then / must be given the path / folder where the WAV files are stored . if the field is not checked , the files will be created in the private folder . do not forget this folder if you want to do something with the WAV files yourself .
enter everything as it is on the screen shot . the command is a bit long , under certain circumstances something must be fl@@ atten@@ ed to the right to see everything .
&apos; --@@ pres@@ et extreme &apos; defines the audio quality of the MP@@ 3@@ s . as mentioned before , this is sufficient for very good audio quality , even for very good hi @-@ fi stereo systems . the resulting bit@@ rate is about 2@@ 24 to 256 k@@ p@@ bs . the achieved compression ratio is 6.3 . this is a good balance between audio quality and memory consumption .
note the &apos; --@@ id@@ 3@@ v@@ 1 @-@ only &apos; entry for restric@@ ting the creation of tags to V@@ 1 / V@@ 1.@@ 1. &apos; ID@@ 3@@ v2 &apos; tags . K@@ id@@ 3 is an excellent &apos; id@@ 3 &apos; tag for &amp; k@@ de ; in case of later change of tags . % f and % o are internal variables for the name of the input file ( including the full path ) and the output file ( including the full path ) .
set the rest as shown in the screen@@ shot . some comments for future use outside of this example :
number of simultaneously enco@@ ders to enco@@ ders : with a dual @-@ core or quad@@ core or even a multi@@ processor machine , it can be tried to en@@ code more than one WAV file at the same time .
that &apos;s it , we &apos;ve just finished the basic setup of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; this configuration is used as a standard for each reading of a &amp; CD ; if you chose the organizational structure of your music wis@@ ely , you never need to change it again .
this section describes how the process of reading the &amp; CD ; runs on the hard disk . we will create MP3 files . the folder structure , the way the music is organized on the hard disk , is set up in the previous section . first , a connection to the internet is built , since we are comfortable and the &amp; CD ; data from the fre@@ ed@@ b must be retri@@ eved .
since we use a &amp; CD which is not yet in fre@@ ed@@ b , the screen@@ shots look a little different from the data collected by fre@@ ed@@ b . therefore , you will learn to enter the &amp; CD ; data manually instead of picking them out of the internet . comments will indicate the differences .
don &apos;t try to find the &amp; CD ; this example is a &apos; special &apos; edition of the author of this manual .
if this is not done yet , the &amp; CD must now be inserted into the drive that was defined in the main window .
after a short moment , the pieces and their length should be listed in the window as shown in the screen@@ shot . this only if the &amp; CD ; as an audio CD ; could be identified and read by c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia .
if this is not done , then browse the questions and answers section in the Help section or go back to the previous section regarding the basic settings .
attention : if the CD ; successfully fet@@ ched from the fre@@ ed@@ b , all tracks of the pieces are already filled and the name of the artist and the album are displayed .
in the event that there is more than one entry in the database with the &apos; unique &apos; &amp; CD ; a window is displayed , and you can select the database entry that fits your opinion best to your &amp; CD .
if you have not selected the check box for the automatic retri@@ eval of fre@@ ed@@ b ( on the page &amp; CD ; Settings dialog for Settings ) , you can also trigger this manually by selecting the first button in the toolbar . if you do not have a local database , but retrieve the data from the Internet , you need the connection to the Internet .
e 1.2 Step 02 : the CD Editor - Input of the CD data and title of the first piece
enter the data for your &amp; CD ; corresponding to the pattern on the next screen shot . the title of the piece in the first line of the input field &apos; Ac@@ tual Tit@@ le &apos; , the rest of the data in the input field &apos; Album &apos; .
the artist no longer has to be entered in the Edit Tit@@ le field , unless you have a collection of different artists for each piece .
the comment field below can be used for individual comments per piece , the comment field of the album is used for comments that are common to all pieces of the CD .
note : following the successful retri@@ eval of the fre@@ ed@@ b data , the CD editor is not empty , but it already contains the data as shown in the following screen@@ shot . however , it is always a good idea to check the contents of the CD editor so that you are not only satisfied with the artist and album name ( e.g. whether all words start with capital letters or not ... ) , but also to check if there are any unwanted comments .
note : in this example , we only use ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 1 tags . this limits the length of the fields to 30 characters for the artist , album and title of a piece and to only 28 characters for the comment section . if you use ID@@ 3@@ v2 tags , you have unlimited field length , at least on what &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; this option is set up on the encoder settings tab .
you can change the tag information of the generated files at any time using the Tag Editor . K@@ id@@ 3 is a good tool for MP3 files , with it you can also create ID@@ 3@@ v2 tags .
tags are not supported by all enco@@ ders or file formats . consult the encoder to get more information .
simply select an entry that is obviously compatible with the style of the read @-@ out CD . in this example , this is not important as we don &apos;t transmit the &amp; CD ; for more information go to fre@@ ed@@ b@@ .org &apos;s web site and read the information on Categories . pop or Ra@@ p for example can be found under Rock .
after choosing &apos; OK &apos; go back to the main window . just click on the line with the second piece .
the window of the CD Editor appears again and you see that the fields for the album are already filled with the entered data we have recorded for the first piece . simply enter the entries for the fields of the current piece . the title of the piece in any case and any other information you wish .
click on the next line in the main window and proceed in the same way until you have entered all the title data of the &amp; CD ;
attention : this window does not appear when you downloaded the data from the fre@@ ed@@ b . it is already sorted into one of these categories of the database .
it is the third button of the toolbar . note that the artist and the album are displayed on the parts list .
note that there is a check mark in front of each line of a piece . only the titles that are selected are read out . a simple click on the line switches the selection of the piece one or off . make sure all pieces are selected , or press the All items button at the bottom of the screen to select all pieces at once .
by clicking on the button selection to read out the selection process , this window will appear to confirm . click OK and then we will take a look at the window with the orders and track what runs out .
click on the tab order to switch to the order window . it is in the left upper half of the window , right under the buttons of the toolbar .
this is the window to control the orders . the first piece is just read on the hard drive . the status of the program is displayed in the left lower part of the window in the status line .
this error message can be seen if you are trying to work with a code that you have not yet installed . pieces that have not been successfully deco@@ ded are marked with a red &apos; X &apos; in the order list .
by the way , the folder for the T@@ MP file and destination folders are not what we entered here in the example . did you check if you have write access to the folder for the temporary files and the destination folder ? ; - )
now it is clear why the error occurred right after the end of the first piece .
the order 1 reads the first piece , it is finished . but we have a new entry : mission 4 is the encoding of piece 1 into the format MP3 . thus , read out and code parallel . note the status message in the bottom part of the window , it is now improved .
the author of the program has not found a configuration setting to supp@@ ress this behavior . the only thing that seems configur@@ able is the number of parallel processes to read and write . the computer used with a AM@@ D@@ 64 seems to have no problem at simultaneous reading and encoding ( from though two different pieces ) .
now the last title is read while another piece is enco@@ ded and a third order placed in the queue of the encoder . after the last piece is enco@@ ded , a small window with a message is displayed for a short time in the upper left part of the window .
for the successful use of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator , you need &amp; k@@ de ; 3.@@ x@@ . or 4.@@ x and c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia . if you want to create compressed audio files like MP3 or O@@ GG , you need the encoder of your choice .
&amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; is maintained today within the &amp; k@@ de ; CVS as part of the k@@ de@@ multimedia package . however , most distri@@ butions already contain a pre @-@ compiled package , since &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; a part of an important &amp; k@@ de ; package is . install the package k@@ de@@ multimedia from your distribution . if you read this , you probably already did it ...
this section is directed to people compiled from source files , and not intended for users who use a pre @-@ compiled package of their distribution .
if you are looking for help how the program can be adapted to your needs once it &apos;s running , then the following is right for you :
a program that calls many different programs has many variations of settings . best you can read the step by step example to get to know the options and settings . it shows screen@@ shots of the different card cards of the settings and also contains comments for options that are not used in the example .
hi , still reading it ? even if only the help menu was cli@@ cked after starting the program first , without any reference point as it will continue from this somehow empty screen ( especially if at the time of the program starts there is no audio CD ; in the drive ) , or from the un@@ usually short menu ?
what is it about ? anyone reading this has probably already started the program . it should look something like this :
a bad example : unfortunately no e @-@ mail . the author cannot maintain this manual . it is intended as the first version for a hand@@ book to &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; anyone who wants to add or change something useful may do . at least after contact with the author . and if you read this , he has left this section and therefore agrees with this suggestion .
stran@@ gely , if you have succeeded in obtaining the source file of the &amp; k@@ de ; SV@@ N , then you do not need these informations , but ...
&amp; k@@ mid ; is the MI@@ DI@@ - and kar@@ a@@ oke player of &amp; k@@ de ; besides others , he has real @-@ time graphics and kar@@ a@@ oke real @-@ time high@@ lighting of texts also some properties that other &amp; UNIX ; -@@ MIDI players do not have .
&amp; k@@ mid ; runs under &amp; Linux ; and FreeBSD . it builds on the O@@ SS system , so it should work on all systems with O@@ SS and &amp; k@@ de ; support also support the &amp; Linux ; Ul@@ tras@@ ound project driver needed for G@@ US cards . Al@@ sa is included as soon as it supports a sequ@@ encer .
&amp; k@@ mid ; displays the lyrics on the screen with changing color , so it &apos;s easy to follow the piece .
graphical representation of the activity of each MIDI channel by high@@ lighting the pressed buttons on the ( virtual ) keyboard .
drag &amp; Drop so that you can drag and drop each MIDI file from a &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; windows to k@@ mid .
supports the two existing standards to store text into MIDI files ( song events or text events ) .
session support . if you finish &amp; k@@ de ; while playing a song , k@@ mid will start with the same song next time .
supports external MIDI syn@@ thesizer , AW@@ E , FM and G@@ US cards ( for the latter you need the LU@@ P driver and g@@ us@@ d ) .
first , you can select View ... from the File menu . it appears the usual file dialog with which help you can select the desired song .
you can also drop a file from a &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ window to the &amp; k@@ mid ; window . this also works with multiple songs simultaneously .
to play a piece of music , open it and press the Play button in the toolbar , select the play item from the menu item or press the space bar .
please note that &amp; k@@ mid ; one piece automatically starts as soon as you drag it to the &amp; k@@ mid ; ( with several pieces you will be added to a collection and then played one after the other . )
as soon as &amp; k@@ mid ; a piece plays , you can jump to any place by using the middle mouse button and moving with the controller back and forth .
if you find that a song is played too fast or too slow , you can click on the left and right arrows of the speed display and thus change the playback speed . to get back the original tempo , double @-@ click on the Tem@@ po@@ - LCD .
the space bar has two tasks : when a piece is played , a pressure on the space bar acts as a pressure on the button break or selecting the menu item Pause in the menu item , thus interrup@@ ts playback . pressing the space bar while no piece is played starts &amp; k@@ mid ; playback .
lyrics can be stored in two ways in one piece of music . some pieces use text event , others use lyrics event and others do both . some pieces have no text at all : - )
in &amp; k@@ mid , you can specify which events to be displayed and even better : the event type will automatically be determined using a song , so you do not have to manually set it up . so , if you select the automatic text selection in the Settings menu , the Kara@@ oke Text will automatically be selected , but you still have the ability to change this if you want to see the other way .
if you want to set up an event type , select the text events and / or the song events from the Settings menu . the same function also has the keys 1 and 2 .
a collection is a list of MIDI files that you summari@@ ze . in this section you will see how you can efficiently use collections .
to create a collection , first open the collection manager . you will find it in the menu collection under the point Organ@@ ize .... Click here and enter the name for the collection .
you can also copy an existing collection by clicking on copy and then speci@@ fying the name for the new collection . at the beginning , this collection will contain the same songs as the original ones .
if you have more than one collection , you can select the each one you want in the collection manager .
the temporary collection contains all the songs you don &apos;t want to add to any other collection .
when ex@@ iting the application , this collection is not saved . remember that when you add a lot of pieces .
to add songs to a collection , it must be selected in the collection manager . there you can add a song with the Add button . it appears in turn the file dialog with which help you can select the desired song .
a second method to add a song depends on setting Automatic addition to the collection .
when automatic addition to the collection is enabled , a piece is automatically added to the active collection when opening ( using File Open or Drag &amp; Drop ) .
if auto add to the collection is not enabled , the temporary collection is activated and emp@@ tied when opening a piece . this collection will then be added to the newly opened pieces .
to remove a song from a collection , you must open the collection manager , select the collection and the desired song and then click on Del@@ ete .
you can select the order in which the songs will be played . if you select the series from the sub@@ menu Select sequence of the menu collections , the songs will be played in the order as they were added to the collection .
when you add or remove songs or select random order in the menu , the order is re@@ defined .
to play a song , select it from the collection manager , or use the selection list above the kar@@ a@@ oke text .
to skip a song , select the Next song button , the entry next song from the menu item or press the arrow to the right .
to jump back a song back , select the button For@@ ward piece , the item Previous piece from the menu item or press the arrow left .
to delete a collection , open the collection manager , select the collection to be deleted and click the Del@@ ete button .
the temporary collection cannot be deleted . however , this does not matter as it is not saved when leaving &amp; k@@ mid .
this is absolutely necessary for syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers , which are not General MIDI @-@ capable . in this case , the MIDI @-@ map transl@@ ates general MIDI events into events that the syn@@ thesizer understands .
for example , you can create a MIDI map that converts all events of the type Change patch to B@@ right Piano into events of the Change patch to Tr@@ ump@@ et type , making a trumpet sound whenever a piano was originally supposed to play .
if you have only one sound card , you do not need a MIDI map , because all sound cards are GM compatible ( including A@@ we and G@@ US cards , FM devices and so on ) .
there are no programs to create MIDI maps , so you have to edit the appropriate file by hand ( with your favorite editor ) .
a MIDI map is a text file that stores all the necessary re@@ plac@@ ements for playing a piece .
each section may only appear once , except the key@@ map section which may appear as often as desired . however , it is necessary that each occurrence has a different text ID ( see below ) .
def@@ ine PAT@@ CH@@ MAP ... EN@@ D Def@@ ine Key@@ map &quot; Name of the key map ... EN@@ D Def@@ ine Key@@ map &quot; A more Key@@ map ... EN@@ D Def@@ ine CH@@ AN@@ N@@ EL@@ MAP ... EN@@ D OP@@ TION@@ S ... EN@@ D
you see that Def@@ ine is needed to indicate that a section starts ( except for OP@@ TION@@ S ) and EN@@ D that the end of a section is reached .
please send me your map file as email so that I can offer in future versions of &amp; k@@ mid ; support for devices that are not General MIDI compliant .
this section specifies how General MIDI can be m@@ apped to your specific keyboard . general use looks like this :
please note that the left side of the equal sign is ignored . it is assumed that the GM patches are in the correct order ( from 0 to 127 ) , so you must not change the order and leave no line for one of the 128 instruments .
the optional All@@ Key@@ s@@ To M is used to place all sounds that this instrument needs to play on tone with number M . if your keyboard doesn &apos;t support a gun shot ( GM @-@ Patch 127 ) , you can take a drum ( e.g. with sound 60 ) , which sounds similar to a gun shot . to do this , use the following in the PAT@@ CH@@ MAP section :
so if a MIDI file is to play a note with Patch 127 ( snapshot ) , it takes patch 100 ( the drum on your keyboard ) and plays the sound 60 , regardless of which sound is in the MIDI file .
please note that the term drum patch is meant to represent a different percussion instrument ( drum , cy@@ mb@@ al , mar@@ ac@@ as &amp; etc ; ) and not the one in which the tone means the pitch of the same drum ( as some key@@ boards possess ) .
the key@@ map section is used to specify how sounds are m@@ apped on a specific channel or instrument . the use is :
as with the PAT@@ CH@@ MAP section , the sequence of lines is very important , as well as its presence . you need to create 128 entries .
you can define several key maps for each channel and instrument . you only have to use different names in the first line .
Key@@ boards are used primarily to map notes on the percussion channel . see for example the included Key@@ boards .
this section can be used to map out some channels to others . for example , if you want to swap the first and second channel , just make it in the CH@@ AN@@ N@@ EL@@ MAP section .
however , these settings are useful for key@@ boards which have the percussion on a specific channel ( General MIDI to Channel 10 , others need channels 16 or 9 ) .
MIDI devices need 16 channels , the CH@@ AN@@ N@@ EL@@ MAP section has 16 lines , numbered from 0 to 15 , built according to the following pattern :
n is the channel that is shown on the channel N . if you use the Key@@ map option , the key map will be used with the name Name for that channel . if you use the For@@ ce@@ Patch option , all events will be ignored , which will try to change the patch on this channel . in this case patch x will always be used .
the For@@ ce@@ Patch flag can be useful for example to always use the perc@@ ussions patch on the perc@@ ussions channel .
if a MIDI file sends a pitch @-@ Ben@@ der event with the value n , it is converted to the formula n * ( r / 40@@ 96 ) and then rel@@ ayed only . the value 40@@ 96 is used to prevent decim@@ al comm@@ as in the map file .
this setting is needed because GM specifies that a keyboard , which receives a pitch @-@ Ben@@ der event with the value 40@@ 96 , is supposed to play a sound higher . unfortunately , however , some key@@ boards are trying to play two tones up to one oc@@ tave higher . to find the right value on your keyboard you need to try a bit with &amp; k@@ mid ; try it around .
to use a MIDI map , simply open the MIDI Settings dialog . this can be found in the menu under Settings , Point MIDI Settings
the channel view is a window with a whole series of key@@ boards ( one for each MIDI channel ) . on these key@@ boards you see which sounds are being played straight .
you can also use the channel view to change the instrument on a specific channel . for each channel there is a selection list where you can select an instrument . if you have changed an instrument , the button lights no longer green but red to indicate that no longer the original instrument is used .
the channel view has ( until now ) two different views to view the played sounds . view the view in the Settings menu under the point channel view : settings
the speed LCD shows the speed at which a song is played . the higher the number , the greater the speed .
you can change the tempo of a song . for example , if you find a song too fast to follow the text , you can slow it down . to change the tempo , use the left and right arrows from the LCD .
a MIDI file is a file containing information about how to play a piece of music . it contains the notes , rhythm , speed , &amp; etc ; thus , the same MIDI file can lead to very different results on two different devices , just like two different musicians can play the same notes in a very different way .
good , I can &apos;t force anyone to use &amp; k@@ mid ; but a typical MIDI file needs about 50 KB , while a mp3 file needs 4 MB ( a compression ratio of 1 : 80 ) and with a good syn@@ thesizer you can also change the individual instruments , speed &amp; etc ; you have control over everything .
this can happen if you have a binary distribution ( rpm , de@@ b ) of &amp; k@@ mid ; that happens because &amp; k@@ mid , compiled without AW@@ E support . to eliminate the problem you need to download and install a source distribution ( for example from k@@ mid ; &apos;s home page )
I want to add a whole folder to a collection , but I don &apos;t want to add all files individually .
dis@@ agree , therefore support &amp; k@@ mid ; Drag &amp; Drop . simply open the folder you want to add in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; , select all files , and drag them to the &amp; k@@ mid ; window .
by default , enable automatic addition to the collection . otherwise , the files will be added to the temporary collection .
you can press the arrow key left of the Tem@@ po@@ - LCD to slow playback . to restore the default tempo , you can double @-@ click on the LCD .
I have an &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ Windows with my MIDI folder and &amp; k@@ mid ; on this desktop ( if I play a MIDI file ) or attached ( if I play a kar@@ a@@ oke file ) , I only have to switch to the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; drag the desired file into the &amp; k@@ mid window .
if you want to listen to a file quickly , without adding them to a collection , turn off the setting Automati@@ cally add to the collection , and the new one ; file will be added to the temporary collection . opening files
let &apos;s assume you have the MIDI files A.@@ mid , B.@@ mid and C.@@ mid@@ . first you just want to play the first file . so set the setting Automati@@ cally add to the collection and open A.@@ mid@@ . your temporary collection then contains exactly this one MIDI file .
then you decide to play B.@@ mid and C.@@ M. and create a collection with all three files . how do you do that ?
these people sent me MIDI files or postcards . thank you very much ! if I hear these songs or see the postcard , it encourages me to program on .
&amp; k@@ mid ; was written by &amp; Antoni@@ o.@@ Lar@@ ro@@ sa@@ .@@ Jim@@ en@@ ez ; I study mathematics at the University of Ma@@ acute ; Mal@@ aga . at the moment I &apos;m studying mathematics at the University of Ma@@ acute ; Mal@@ aga . at the moment I &apos;m studying mathematics at the University of Ma@@ acute ; I &apos;m trying to take some time for my hob@@ bies .
if you want to know where to download MIDI / kar@@ a@@ oke files , if you have a question , an error or an idea for an extension of &amp; k@@ mid ; or even if you just want to make me happy , write me an email : lar@@ rosa @ k@@ de@@ .org or ant@@ lar@@ r @ ar@@ ra@@ is@@ .@@ es
you really make me a great joy when you send me a postcard from your home or a MI@@ DI@@ - / kar@@ a@@ oke file from a local group . all of which send me a postcard or a MIDI file , I will list with friends of &amp; k@@ mid ; but before you send a MIDI file , you should contact me because I might already have the file .
I have written &amp; k@@ mid ; completely written in my spare time and won &apos;t get money from anyone for it . I would like to emphasize that I only want to program@@ mati@@ ze because / when I get feedback from users ( postcards or emails ) .
Tak@@ ashi I@@ wa@@ i and Joseph H. BÃ¼h@@ ler - corrected the defect that the pitch of AW@@ E cards was too high .
my thanks also goes to Jose L@@ us San@@ che@@ z for testing the G@@ US support , Ign@@ acio Gar@@ cia for testing AW@@ E support , H@@ as Pet@@ ter Bi@@ ek@@ er , O@@ la Sig@@ ur@@ dson , Marc Di@@ ef@@ en@@ bruch , Peter Gr@@ it@@ sch , Peter @-@ Paul Witt@@ a , Thor@@ sten Wes@@ thei@@ der , Ulrich Cor@@ des and anyone who has sent me a patch , bug alert or even a suppor@@ tive e @-@ mail .
and of course , thanks also to all of these outstanding musicians on the net , who give us these wonderful MI@@ DI@@ - and kar@@ a@@ oke files .
in addition , it can be found on its homepage , which is located under ht@@ t@@ p : / / www.@@ ar@@ ra@@ is@@ .@@ es / ~ r@@ lar@@ rosa / k@@ mi@@ d.@@ html . on the homepage you can follow the development , search for information and look at pictures . you will also find links to sites with other kar@@ a@@ oke songs , &amp; etc ;
a sound card . I recommend you a good sound card or an external syn@@ thesizer , because the sound quality depends essentially on your sound card . it is not the same whether you use a FM radio or an AW@@ E card .
if you don &apos;t have a sound card , you need to compile and compile with the MO@@ DE _ DE@@ MO _ ON@@ LY@@ VIS@@ U@@ AL parameter . it then runs as if you had a sound card except that you can of course not hear music .
if problems occur , contact one of the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ Ma@@ iling Li@@ sts or send an error message directly to me .
&amp; K@@ M@@ Player ; is a simple interface for M@@ Player , Phon@@ o and FF@@ MPEG . the program is used to play video files supported by M@@ Player or phon@@ on supported formats , as well as for playback DVD s , V@@ CD s or TV and camera .
the &amp; k@@ app@@ name documentation ; was not yet finished as &amp; k@@ de ; installed on this computer .
for additional help , please check the page The K@@ DE website for new versions , or send the question to The &amp; k@@ de ; user mailing list .
the application window is made of so @-@ called and@@ o@@ ck@@ able windows . there is always the window with the central view . alternatively , there is the window with the playlist . and finally , there is an information window that will only be displayed when information is returned .
it is possible to save the preferred connections under the Book@@ mark menu , but these are individual entries . if you want to create a list of entries that are played after each other , you should use the category Perman@@ ent Play@@ list .
of course you can add groups to groups to obtain an additional hierarch@@ ical level . if you click an entry , his group and all his sub@@ groups will be copied to the current category and playback begins with the selected entry .
the categories &apos; current play &apos; , TV and permanent playlist can also be changed by editing XML configuration files . of course , you can only do this if &amp; K@@ M@@ Player ; not run through an editor , but also by the application itself . simply click on a name of a category , select from the View menu and see the next editing mode . by clicking a sub@@ group only the XML content of this part will be shown .
after modi@@ fying XML files , you must select the same playlist from the same menu and select either the edit mode or select another category .
all changes are lost when editing edit mode or selecting another group without matching the playlist .
due to the convenience of the author of &amp; K@@ M@@ Player , some functions can only be enabled by changing the XML configuration files .
the animation during starting and ending can be disabled by editing ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / k@@ m@@ play@@ er@@ c and modi@@ fying &#91; General Options &#93; No In@@ tro = 0 ob@@ iger option on &apos; 1 &apos; . if the option is not available , it can be easily inserted .
it is also possible to activate another animation . &amp; K@@ M@@ Player ; note the files ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / K@@ M@@ Player / intro@@ .x@@ ml and ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / K@@ M@@ Player / ex@@ it@@ .x@@ ml . the format must be a supported XML file .
the animation during start does not need to be short , it is automatically terminated by opening another source . however , this would be annoying in the end animation , so the user can finish the application a second time .
a simple example of a start animation may be the display of a favorite picture : &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; body@@ work ; &amp; lt ; im@@ g dur = &quot; in@@ tec &quot; sr@@ c = &quot; file : / / / home / K@@ oos / m@@ um@@ .@@ gi@@ f &quot; fit = &quot; meet &quot; / lt ; &amp; lt ; / sm@@ il@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / etc .
there is a tab for configur@@ ing M@@ Player in the configuration dialog of &amp; K@@ M@@ Player ; here you can set the path from the M@@ Player and the cache size of the data stream from the network and other things .
another tool for troubleshooting is the &apos; Con@@ sole &apos; button in the toolbar of K@@ M@@ Player . here the output of m@@ player can be seen .
there is no tab for this playback device in the configuration dialog of &amp; K@@ M@@ Player ; everything must be configured by manual editing of file ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / k@@ m@@ play@@ er@@ c , such as setting the back@@ end by mim@@ et@@ ype . here is an example like a &apos; flash &apos; played with the sw@@ f@@ de@@ c @-@ mo@@ z@@ illa module :
&apos; flash &apos; can be played within &amp; K@@ M@@ Player ; it can even insert the special em@@ bed to YouTube in the playlist XML .
so that the &amp; K@@ M@@ Player ; &apos; flash &apos; can play in HTML pages , the &amp; K@@ M@@ Player must be given as service provider for the mim@@ e type application / x @-@ sho@@ ck@@ wave @-@ flash in the setup dialog file assignments of K@@ DE .
the kon@@ quer@@ or or &amp; K@@ M@@ Player ; is used in a console application and to search for error messages regarding the loading of the browser module library . if no errors occur here , the back@@ end output is inside &amp; K@@ M@@ Player ; ( view , console , or console from the context menu to check ) .
to always use a pre@@ defined back@@ end for a specific mim@@ e type ( of course only if this has been determined ) , this must be done by manually changing the file ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / k@@ m@@ play@@ er@@ c . for example , phon@@ on should play all o@@ gg files :
&amp; K@@ M@@ Player ; can play from TV cards , either using M@@ Player or X@@ Video ( this requires k@@ x@@ v@@ player ) . before watching TV , you need to configure the device to be used and the TV channels . to do this , the scanner can be used from the configuration dialog or the configuration file can be edited manually .
for configur@@ ing the V@@ DR ( Video Data Recorder ) settings in the K@@ M@@ Player , the dialog in the Settings under - &gt; Qu@@ el@@ le- &gt; V@@ DR@@ - &gt; X@@ Video Port should be used . there you should detect ports from which one is selected . the encoding must be found ( for example , it is PAL for West Europe ) , the correct name probably has a dv@@ b contained in it .
since the V@@ DR support from K@@ M@@ Player can only use X@@ Video , X@@ Video should also work ( probably this type of playing video devices under Linux is the only one that works ) . for this reason , the video@@ for@@ lin@@ ux extension for the X@@ Free@@ 86 server must contain the following in its configuration file ( / etc / X@@ 11 / X@@ F@@ 86@@ Con@@ fig ) :
internally by K@@ M@@ Player , various names are used by K@@ M@@ Player . at the time of the creation of this documentation , this dv@@ d@@ nav@@ al , dv@@ d@@ source , ex@@ it@@ source , intro@@ source , pi@@ pes@@ ource , t@@ v@@ scanner , TV@@ Source , ur@@ l source , v@@ c@@ d@@ source and v@@ dr@@ source . if enabled , start playing the playlist .
are there any hints how to make my CD@@ ROM drive qui@@ eter when I play from it ( not from the V@@ CD : / / ) ?
yes , the command HD@@ PAR@@ M -@@ E 8 / dev / c@@ drom is to run as root after the device is plug@@ ged into . it is essential to make sure that / dev / c@@ drom drives on the CD@@ ROM drive .
x@@ ine only starts up slowly , why every time my CPU has to be checked for its performance ?
note : the answer is over@@ hau@@ . k@@ x@@ ine@@ player automatically needs the last stored value , only the first time x@@ ine will check the CPU .

Q@@ T ; : &amp; Q@@ t ; is a C + + library for creating graphical user interfaces and network support and becomes comp@@ iling &amp; ki@@ le ; needed .
latex ; : a professional writing application . under Unix @-@ like systems it is likely to be used on the package &amp; tex@@ as ; or &amp; tet@@ ex ; ( for older systems ) .
most of these components can be included in the Linux and Linux distribution . for the installation , the documentation of the distribution or installation CD should be used / DVD .
the &amp; ki@@ le ; -@@ project includes some pre @-@ compiled packages of &amp; ki@@ le ; for various distri@@ butions . these allow easy installation without further compile and are included on the ki@@ le ; -@@ web page .
this manual is for everyone - independent of experiences with &amp; latex ; , &amp; k@@ de ; , &amp; ki@@ le ; or &amp; Linux ; .
advanced users hardly need to read this manual . however , all documentation is considered for documentation purposes . if the support for this project or its documentation is desired , the contact via the ki@@ le ; -@@ web site should be made .
if you have questions about the comp@@ iling of &amp; ki@@ le ; on or if extensions wish , this should be addressed to the ki@@ le @-@ de@@ vel @ list@@ s.@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net mailing list .
&amp; ki@@ le ; is an integrated &amp; latex ; environment for the &amp; k@@ de ; desktop . &amp; ki@@ le ; provides the opportunity to use all &amp; latex ; functions in a graphical interface and within this simple , immediate and custom access to all &amp; latex ; -@@ programs . finally , the easy @-@ to @-@ use wizard , the &amp; latex ; Reference and the powerful project management .
to learn more about &amp; k@@ ate ; and to know its possibilities , the manual on K@@ ate should be consul@@ ted . users of &amp; ki@@ le ; can begin there directly with reading the chapter works with the editor of &amp; k@@ ate ; start .
for latex ; is the correct language : L@@ ay @-@ TECH . while the original &amp; tex ; difficult to use , also a lay@@ man ( english lay ) &amp; latex ; -@@ Mak@@ ros can also be used . a less demanding but more realistic explanation is that it desc@@ ends from the sur@@ name of Les@@ lie La m@@ port .
while there is only a good overview about latex ; given , it is not the ultimate book about it . to be able to master correctly , good books should be used e.g. H. Kop@@ ka / P. W. D@@ aly , A Guide to &amp; latex ; : document Prepar@@ ation for Beg@@ inners and Advanced U@@ sers , 3rd Edition , 1999 .
the introduction contains at least the command \ \ Docum@@ ent@@ class , the body begins with the command \ \ begin { document } and must be closed with the command \ \ begin { document } and must be closed with the command \ \ end { document } .
the Quick Cli@@ ft@@ entry Wi@@ zard of &amp; ki@@ le ; is an useful feature for fast creation of a document in &amp; ki@@ le ; the selection of the wizard ( menu ) offers several possibilities for creating the document . some settings can also be made to the document .
document classes : this defines the type of document to be created : article ( article ) , book &#91; book &#93; , cover letter &#91; letter &#93; , article ( DIN ) &#91; sc@@ r@@ art@@ cl &#93; , report ( DIN ) &#91; sc@@ r@@ t@@ cl &#93; , projector &#91; be@@ amer &#93; , film &#91; Pro@@ sp@@ er &#93; or user defined .
encoding : with this the character encoding is set . modern systems are increasingly using U@@ TF @-@ 8 encoding as standard . at best U@@ TF @-@ 8@@ X should be used ( for correct processing of latex ; documents ) .
this list contains the most commonly used supplementary packages for and latex ; for the integration they must only be selected in the check box .
article ( DIN ) , book ( DIN ) , letter ( DIN ) , letter ( DIN ) : the documentation classes of Kom@@ a @-@ Script ( to comply with German DIN regulations ) .
new users don &apos;t have to worry about it . it is just a brief description of the functions and further information about this are given in the section .
&amp; ki@@ le ; provides - just like other source code editors - high@@ lighting the used commands , settings and elements ( as well as the in@@ appropriate ) . if you see larger areas of a green text on screen , it is likely that some mathematical environment is not closed .
when entering a new command ( e.g. \ \ begin { command } ) of &amp; ki@@ le , an empty line ( for example , \ \ end { command } ) will automatically create a blank line ( for example , \ \ end { order } ) . this function can be disabled in the menu settings ; set up La@@ Te@@ X commands .
all documents are usually divided into some elements . &amp; latex ; allows to sub@@ divide the document into the following elements ( part is the highest and sub@@ paragraph the lowest element ) :
in the view of the document in the structure view , the individual elements can be changed and viewed by a click of a mouse .
when creating the own &amp; latex ; files may be very helpful as soon as a DVI ; file &#91; device independent file ( eng@@ l . D e V ice I n@@ ine@@ File ) &#93; was created , jumps &amp; ki@@ le ; by a click with the middle mouse button in DVI ; viewers to the corresponding line in the &amp; latex ; source code .
a DVI ; file contains a description of the format@@ ted document and other information such as the font and is next to PDF the original output type of &amp; tex ; or &amp; latex ; there are many tools for viewing , converting and printing DVI ; files for different systems and devices .
when using the code search , the elements of the DVI file are drawn up with the editor and as soon as an element in the DVI ; file has been cli@@ cked , the corresponding section is j@@ umped in the &amp; latex ; the default search is the exact opposite of it . as soon as a section is cli@@ cked in the &amp; latex ; source text , the corresponding point is j@@ umped in the DVI file .
master document : this function is used when working with multiple files . with a master document , work is simplified with other .@@ tex files . when using a project , a project @-@ wide master document can be set to project settings .
quick construction : the &amp; latex ; source code is compiled and the result is automatically displayed ( if there are no errors in the source code ) .
file monitoring : in this mode , the DVI ; file is based on &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; external &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and no call from &amp; ey@@ epi@@ ece ; after fast construction . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
when viewing the editing toolbar , the three large selection fields should be noticed . the selection fields have been developed for quick integration of common elements into the document . the first drop @-@ down box is for quick integration of the document into sections , chapters , sections , ... The available &amp; latex ; commands for sub@@ division are :
the selection box For further information is available for items such as keywords , notes or references . the possibilities available are :
name : with this command , a name for a section , a picture or other element is created .
cover : used for reference to a specified term ( selection above a selection box possible ) .
when using quote , a selection list with literary entries is displayed . for &amp; bi@@ b@@ tex ; this only works if the file is connected to a project . the author has good experiences with &amp; k@@ bi@@ b@@ tex ; and &amp; k@@ b ; . the &amp; bi@@ b@@ tex ; files can also be written in &amp; ki@@ le ; by hand .
the last drop @-@ down box with the name Gr@@ Ã Â¶ Ã Â¼ e is used for defining the font items . it is possible to define the font items for the main text , the joints nodes , etc . there are the following types of fonts available :
when calling &amp; ki@@ le ; two choices are available : 1 . the wizard for creating a new document by selecting document type and setting the settings . 2 . the document can be written from scratch by hand .
the par@@ enth@@ eses after the command \ \ Docum@@ ent@@ class contain the settings for the command . the setting &#91; 12@@ pt &#93; specifies the font . if the font is not specified at the beginning , this can also be done in the text .
once the above source code example has been entered , the &amp; latex ; source code must be compiled . the easiest way to do this is to use the menu building or button quick construction .
the source code must be stored before comp@@ iling .
if the compilation of the document fails , the error should be searched for errors . if this is not the case , the logging should be started automatically . if this is not the case , logging should also be considered .
an environment ( English environment ) is a text that is treated differently from the rest of the document . for example , a report with the font file 12 is created , and only a few columns should have a different font . the command \ \ begin { environment } , \ \ Hu@@ ge and \ \ end { environment } will then allow for the alteration of the written documents in the environment .
the changes are only checked within the environment ( from \ \ begin { environment } to \ \ end { environment } ) . there is no limit ( number ) for the changes within an environment .
there are many possibilities to increase the read@@ ability and usability of the document . for example , certain fonts , bold printing , offensive pressure , sub@@ missions , etc. can be added . these commands end either with the command \ \ end or automatically at the end of the environment .
\ \ begin { emp@@ h } : this command is for the offensive pressure and is valid until it is closed with \ \ end { emp@@ h } or any other environment . a single word in a set can be displayed itali@@ c with \ \ emp@@ h { word } .
\ \ quote : creates a quote in the document . the quote begins with \ \ begin { ratio } and ends with \ \ end { ratio } .
after the background for writing the source text with the &amp; latex ; drawing language has been presented , now follows a step @-@ by @-@ step guide for creating a document in &amp; ki@@ le ; .
as soon as a bit of text was entered in the wizard , a few adjustments should be made for the better read@@ ability of the document . this should include a quotation , a few passages in bold and cur@@ sive print and a poem to be used to see the differences of these commands .
once the document has been viewed , the editor view or C@@ trl E can be returned to the editor ( in the internal viewer ) .
once the DVI ; file was created , the document can be printed out or converted into a &amp; Post@@ Script ; / PDF file . simply try and have fun .
DVI ; is an independent file format ( English D e V ice I n@@ ativ ) . these files are created by &amp; tex ; or &amp; latex ; for the read@@ ability of some drivers of the computer . there are many different types of .@@ d@@ vi output such as printers , &amp; Post@@ Script ; / PDF Converter or computer screens .
for printing a &amp; DVI file , the same steps as required for the creation of the document ( see ) . at the 7th step - after clicking on DVI , the document can then be printed by file printing ( in the viewer ) ( if the printer is set correctly ) .
the toolbar allows the conversion of the DVI file into other formats . as soon as the DVI ; file from the &amp; latex ; source text was created , the conversion can begin in different formats by means of the buttons in the toolbar .
the preview search allows the direct jump from the editor to the associated position within the DVI ; file .
&amp; ki@@ le ; provides a corresponding setting for all and latex ; -@@ bin@@ aries . to do this , simply setup Modern under Settings box ... tools Building will be selected .
to select the preview search , the mouse poin@@ ter must be positioned in a row of the source text and then cli@@ cked on the preview search . the jump to the corresponding point in DVI ; the viewer takes place then .
with this function in &amp; ey@@ epi@@ ece ; with a click of the middle mouse button in DVI ; -@@ document the corresponding &amp; latex ; -@@ document of &amp; ki@@ le ; opened and j@@ umped to the corresponding line . to do so , &amp; ki@@ le ; in &amp; ey@@ epi@@ ece ; in &amp; ey@@ epi@@ ece ( Settings ey@@ epi@@ ece ... Editor )
if there is no error when using quick construction of the &amp; DVI file , there may be an error . if an error is present , it will be displayed in the logging file or in the message window .
the logging file contains the source code error source . in the editor , the bugs predic@@ tive La@@ Te@@ X errors and ne@@ sts La@@ Te@@ X errors can be used for jumps between the errors . in order to view the correct line , the error must be cli@@ cked in the logging and &amp; ki@@ le ; jumps to the wrong line .
once you click on the corresponding button in the toolbar , a window will appear to select the template you want to use . the default options are :
when selecting an empty document , a document can either be re@@ written from scratch or the wizard can be used for the quick creation of a new document . for more information , see the section .
hands @-@ on users of &amp; latex ; usually use the same introduction for almost all documents . templates can be created in &amp; ki@@ le ; created , stored and loaded to facilitate the creation of a new document .
to create a new template , either an existing &amp; tex ; - / latex ; file must be opened or created a new file . &amp; ki@@ le ; can create a new template by opening an existing document and selecting File Tem@@ plate from document ...
when creating a new document from a template using File New , some strings are replaced by other data ( e.g. name or character encoding ) . these variables can be set in Settings box ... Settings .
when creating your own template it is necessary to know which strings are replaced by which variables :
$ $ DO@@ CU@@ MEN@@ T@@ CLA@@ SS@@ OP@@ TION@@ S $ $ : this string is replaced by typing in document class . typically , it is used as follows : \ \ Docum@@ ent@@ class &#91; $ $ DO@@ CU@@ MEN@@ T@@ CLA@@ SS@@ OP@@ TION@@ S $ $ &#93; { items } .
the easiest way to create a template is to use the wizard and the associated entry of the commands in the editor . once the document has been created in this way , the following steps must be taken :
when creating a new document , your own template can then be selected instead of the standard items .
a template can be created from any &amp; latex ; a simple way to create a template needs to be searched for one on the Internet and the steps described below are searched .
&amp; ki@@ le ; used &amp; k@@ ate ; as an internal editor . &amp; k@@ ate ; is a text editor for program@@ mers with the possibility of reading and highlight from many different types of text files ( including &amp; latex ; and &amp; bi@@ b@@ tex ; ) .
to learn more about it ; and to know its possibilities , the manual on K@@ ate should be consul@@ ted . users of &amp; ki@@ le ; can begin there directly with reading the chapter works with the editor of &amp; k@@ ate ; start .
&amp; ki@@ le ; provides a very practical &amp; latex ; command reference which can be called via the La@@ Te@@ X reference menu . it contains a detailed description of almost all commands that can be found in &amp; latex ; use their syntax .
double @-@ click with pressed C@@ trl key to select the &amp; tex ; word . that means that in this way , when you click on \ \ par \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ .
when dra@@ gging the text with a left mouse button , the selected text is automatically copied to the clip@@ board .
when using the arrow keys with pressed Shift key , parts of the source code can be selected in the Editor window .
&amp; ki@@ le ; has the possibility to search for various types of source code and emphasize it . for example , the &amp; latex distinguishes itself ; -@@ commands from normal text and also the mathematical formulas are highlighted by a different color .
many assistants can perform additional jump marks . this is an own type of book@@ mark within the text . the menu entries do the jump to the next or last jump mark . this will also highlight the jump mark , so that it will automatically be deleted during the first input of a character .
editing is probably one of the main aspects when using a program such as &amp; ki@@ le ; although &amp; k@@ ate ; already excellent opportunities offered , have been added in &amp; ki@@ le ; important functions for writing a &amp; latex ; source code added &amp; ki@@ le ; special commands for their selection .
select a complete he@@ el ( group of lines containing an empty line on both sides ) . with a paragraph it is not meant a text with continuous lines ( like in other text editors ) . this extended meaning includes tables , &amp; latex ; commands and all other lines of the source code .
select the word under the current cursor position . this selection also has an extended meaning since this command also contains &amp; latex ; -@@ commands with a backup line ( \ \ ) and an additional star ( * ) at the end .
to delete a part of the document , of course , it can be selected first and removed by pressing the Del@@ ete key . &amp; k@@ ate ; provides the key C@@ trl ; K with which the entire line is removed . &amp; ki@@ le ; provides with own commands here for a faster possibility . under Edi@@ ting Rem@@ ove the following commands are included to delete the text :
remove a complete he@@ el . the definition for a paragraph in &amp; box ; is included in the description to edit select paragraph .
it has already been clari@@ fied that environments play a central role in &amp; latex ; therefore , &amp; ki@@ le ; for further commands under Edit surroundings for one possible simple work with &amp; latex ; .
this command jumps to the beginning of the current environment ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cursor is placed directly in front of the command to close the environment .
this command jumps to the end of the current environment ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cursor is placed directly behind the command to close the environment .
if the cursor is located in front of or inside the command \ \ begin { surroundings } , the cursor jumps to the end of the environment ( or vice versa ) .
when entering many ne@@ sted environment commands , the overview can quickly be lost . this command closes the last modified environment so that the ne@@ sted environment structure is not destroyed .
&amp; ki@@ le ; provides also special commands for the &amp; latex ; groups that are determined by { ... } . under Edit Te@@ X group are a few important commands that correspond to those from the Edit environment .
this command jumps to the beginning of the current group ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cursor is placed directly in front of the opening bracket .
this command jumps to the end of the current group ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cursor is placed directly behind the closed clasp .
if the cursor above or behind the bra@@ ces of an &amp; tex ; -@@ group # is located , jumps to the other end of the group ( or vice versa ) .
when entering many ne@@ sted group@@ ed par@@ enth@@ eses , the overview can quickly be lost . this command includes the last opened group , so that the ne@@ sted structure of the &amp; tex ; groups will not be destroyed .
in &amp; latex ; two simple application characters are used as bed liners . for the appropriate implementation is used in &amp; ki@@ le ; the sign &quot; for two simple touch characters . &quot; also for the end of the application the sign &quot; is used . &amp; ki@@ le ; knows this case and holds two connecting signs for latex ; one .
this automatic entry of the double conversion marks can be set up under Settings box ... La@@ Te@@ X can be switched on and off .
it can also be used for ad specific settings ( e.g. n@@ ol@@ or French ) and thus German or French application notes . there are also many other languages available .
when pressing Shift ; Enter key &amp; box ; an intelligent line break . if the current position is located within a list environment ( e.g. en@@ umer@@ ate or it@@ em@@ ize ) , &amp; ki@@ le ; not just a line break but at the same time the command \ \ item .
within a table environment , &amp; ki@@ le ; the current line with \ \ \ \ with an end @-@ of @-@ the @-@ line termination .
even better - &amp; ki@@ le ; is intelligent enough to support pres@@ et &amp; latex ; - or user @-@ defined environments . these can be til@@ ted under Settings ... La@@ Te@@ X can be added .
some users want to arrange columns in tables environments and all E@@ t characters ( amp ; ) among each other . &amp; ki@@ le ; tries to inv@@ ent this . although this tab is not the added one , &amp; ki@@ le ; add some space for the columns position of the current tab@@ ul@@ ator .
although &amp; k@@ ate ; already provides a good source code completion , it has been extended in &amp; ki@@ le ; in order to build special commands ( mostly for latex ; ) there are five different modes . three of them work as needed and the other two are for automatic completion . all these modes can be set for different modes of work under Settings box ... Can be adjusted .
at the beginning a new environment is added using the command \ \ begin { environment } &amp; ki@@ le ; automatically add the command \ \ end { surroundings } after an empty line ( for the text ) .
when pressing the back button the last letter of the input is removed and possibly the completion list is removed . on the other hand , the list can also be reduced by entering another letter .
all commands are written with a short description of their parameters . the descriptions are obviously removed when selecting a command . alternatively , ho@@ ck marks may be inserted , so that a simple jump to these positions is possible by editing the jump mark N@@ Ã Â¤ ch@@ ute jump mark and the desired parameters can then be inserted .
settings ki@@ le ; set up ... ki@@ le ; complete settings can be made to these lists . there can be several lists of lists for &amp; tex ; - and &amp; latex ; commands as well as call@@ ers of the general language used .
command mode is not useful for completing environments . there are always a few letters to be entered with \ \ begin and the call for complete control mode will result in a large list of surrounding commands . on the other hand , the environments are so often used that &amp; ki@@ le ; a special mode for completing the environments .
when calling the complete control mode , the menu item Alt + Shift key space bar is automatically filled with the command to open the environment and it appears \ \ begin . afterwards , the ambient completion can be continued in the simplest way and can be stopped by pressing the input button .
once this is done , the environment is automatically closed again . once &amp; ki@@ le ; realize that it is a list environment , even a first \ \ item command is added .
settings ki@@ le ; set up ... ki@@ le ; default settings can be made to these lists . this mode uses the list of exec@@ uting mode for &amp; tex ; - and &amp; latex ; -@@ commands .
&amp; ki@@ le ; support custom lists of abbrevi@@ ations , which are immediately replaced by default strings . the lists can be set up under Settings box ... Ki@@ le Ver@@ corrupt can be set up . as an example of a drop @-@ down list , the file ex@@ amp@@ le.@@ c@@ w@@ l , in which the entry L = \ \ La@@ Te@@ X is included .
for example , if the letter L is entered and the word initi@@ ates the word processing mode about the menu , the character L is replaced by the \ \ La@@ Te@@ X string .
large @-@ scale wi@@ pers are not helpful for automatic completion . however , it has been found that many r@@ ters are written more than once in a document . this provides &amp; ki@@ le ; the completion for all already written orders .
this mode can be set up in the Settings box ... Ki@@ le Ver@@ sions will be de@@ cryp@@ ted . here , the threshold value for the display of the completion can also be specified .
the complete files can be installed in the sub@@ folder ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / ki@@ le / complete / mode / of the personal home folder . mode stands for abbrevi@@ ation ( abbrevi@@ ation ) , dictionary ( W@@ Ã Â¶ r@@ ter@@ buch ) or tex .
the dialog Prin@@ ts incorporate the introduction of graphics as simple as possible . to view the basics of the graphics formats , the sections should be considered .
PS files are not as well known as PDF files but provide an excellent basis for changes and re@@ orders from pages . if the PDF output is required , the pages can be re@@ arranged with a few &amp; Post@@ Script ; tools and then converted to a PDF file with ps@@ 2@@ pdf .
in order to be able to examine the results of the work , the source code must be compiled . all construction tools are group@@ ed together in the menu Cre@@ ating comp@@ iling , converting and creating view .
for comp@@ iling the source code for viewers like &amp; Ok@@ ey@@ epi@@ ece ; or the further conversion can be used by the key single Alt ; 2 . afterwards , the DVI ; file can be viewed as a standard viewer by means of Alt ; 3 , by means of old ; 4 the DVI ; file converted into a PS file and viewed using Alt ; 5 the PS file .
when using the Quick Start command , a viewer is usually called after comp@@ iling . if no embedded viewer is used , a new window will each be opened each time .
a new project is about the Men@@ Ã Â¼ project New Project .... This is where the following information is consul@@ ted for the project :
when selecting the file name window , the relative path must be specified by the .@@ kil@@ ep@@ r project file .
the &amp; ki@@ le script function ; allows for exec@@ uting EC@@ MA@@ Script code . scripts can be managed through scripts in the vertical bar .
the API scripts are not yet fully developed and can be changed in other versions of &amp; ki@@ le .
first , it must be said that the execution environment of the scripts in &amp; ki@@ le ; a system @-@ wide object ( = ki@@ le ) has the following methods :
&amp; latex ; is a quite well @-@ developed system where basic functions can be extended by a variety of additional packages . &amp; ki@@ le ; provides a lot of different aids to support users .
&amp; tet@@ ex ; and &amp; tex@@ te ; supplied with many documents . included in this are a documentation for the packages contained and another &amp; latex ; reference .
this is not only a description of all programs ( but a few important pack@@ ets are described ) but rather is a complete instruction manual for the &amp; latex ; it is therefore ideal for searching for a specific format@@ ting . since this is a very large document , it is divided into three important book@@ marks .
due to the amount of documents with which &amp; tet@@ ex ; / tex@@ tured ; delivered , finding the right document is not always easy . as possible help provides &amp; tet@@ ex ; / tex@@ tured ; the small application tex@@ doc@@ t@@ k which contains a database with all documents and for a graphical surface .
all documents are divided into categories and the greater advantage is the search for parcel names or banners . of &amp; ki@@ le ; only the results are displayed .
double @-@ clicking with the mouse or the space bar will open the viewer for the document .
&amp; ki@@ le ; is a qu@@ el@@ lo@@ ff@@ ener and user @-@ friendly &amp; latex ; - / tex ; source text editor available for different architec@@ tures of &amp; Linux ; - and Unix @-@ like systems . &amp; ki@@ le ; is also part of the Fink project , which means &amp; ki@@ le ; also on &amp; Mac ; with OS X installed .
many thanks to those who asp@@ ire after the existence of the &amp; ki@@ le ; project and offer for many hours for the development of tools we can use all under consideration of the &amp; GNU ; license .

&amp; sig , is a graphical editor to manage many different signatures for e @-@ mails . with the command @-@ line interface you create random signatures or signatures from a list . this command @-@ line interface provides signatures for external e @-@ mail programs such as &amp; k@@ mail ; .
for random signatures , any signature from the signature file is read by &amp; C@@ sig ; by many signatures with different quot@@ ations , styles and information , you can create your emails varied and unique .
for day signatures , the same signature will be read from the Sig@@ nature File of &amp; C@@ sig for the whole day . for each day , use different signatures , as with the random signatures you create unique emails .
to create a new signature , select C@@ trl ; N file New . by this , you will receive an empty signature ; in the Sig@@ natures section . click on the &amp; lt ; empty signature ; and add your new signature in the lower section . signature Ex@@ qi Con@@ qi @ k@@ de@@ .org ht@@ t@@ p : / / www.@@ k@@ de@@ .org If you have entered your signature , save it with C@@ trl ; S file Save or click the Save button .
you can create as many signatures as you like . then you have a list of signatures for e @-@ mail programs such as &amp; k@@ mail ; whether you use emails privately or professionally , there are always enough signatures .
to delete a signature , select it first and then in the File menu Rem@@ ove or click the icon with the red cross in the toolbar .
here you can select short commands for menu entries . to change a short command , select an action from the list . then click on the user defined button on the right @-@ hand side and enter the new short@@ cut by pressing the key or key combination .
to use &amp; cate ; is &amp; k@@ de ; 3.5 is required . to attach signatures to your e @-@ mails , you need a program like &amp; k@@ mail ; or another program that can insert the signature text from the output of a command .
all call stack elements are listed here . the older the pile entry is , the lower the frame number . see the example below .
by clicking a call stack in the shown list , the cursor is placed in the main window to the corresponding line number of the corresponding file .

the version 3.2 by &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; contains many new &amp; XML ; tools and functions . these tools are unique in their integration in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; all these tools use com@@ man@@ ders as surface and lib@@ x@@ m@@ l@@ 2 and lib@@ x@@ s@@ lt . the combination results in fast , efficient , complete and productive tools .
anyone who has worked with the &amp; k@@ de ; documentation knows me and how outstanding it is . if we still take it a piece , we give it a graphical interface ! no longer rely on a terminal ; simply click the icon for the XML processor and finished !
this application expects a inde@@ x.@@ doc@@ book in the folder . if inde@@ x.@@ doc@@ book is located in a ge@@ w@@ y working folder , then let the current working folder be checked . if not , then remove the selection of current working folders and enter the desired folder in the field of other folders .
output files are stored in the same folder as the source files . all previous &amp; HTML ; files are deleted every time my Outlook is started .
as already said , anyone who has worked on the &amp; k@@ de ; documentation already knows how helpful this application is . and with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; there is now a great graphical interface for that .
if the currently opened file is inde@@ x.@@ doc@@ book , simply select the current working folder . if not , then select the current working folder and enter the folder where inde@@ x.@@ doc@@ book is to be found .
if it comes to an output on the screen , its file is faulty . please check the reported errors and try again .
if the file to be checked is already marked in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us , then you can simply edit the current file . if not , you delete the file in the current file and select the file to be checked by another file - File selection .
if you just want to know if the well @-@ formed file is , click the well @-@ formed check option .
to use a &amp; DT@@ D ; which is specified in the &amp; XML ; file , choose &amp; DT@@ D ; ( Internal ) , otherwise &amp; DT@@ D ; ( External ) and specify the location of the &amp; DT@@ D ; file selection . both for the &amp; W@@ 3@@ C ; &amp; XML ; schema and for the Relax@@ NG inspection is the definition of the definition UR@@ I ; in the file selection necessary .
yes , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; has also a &amp; X@@ SL ; processing tool ! this uses the x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c tool from the lib@@ x@@ m@@ l@@ 2 library .
if the file to be processed in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us is already selected , then you can simply select current file . if not , remove the current file and select the file to be processed using the other file cho@@ oser .
enter the name of the file as the result should have named , and the file will normally be stored in your home folder .
the plug @-@ ins , the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; load , have with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; even possibly little to do . this makes the plug @-@ in system very powerful . you can benefit from the additional functionality immediately and do not wait until somebody builds the fake in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; the plug @-@ ins can be used in a large number of &amp; GUI ; more about it further down .
to install a plugin or a part , we start with the Edit menu . this opens the following dialog :
this dialog allows to manage all contained plug @-@ ins and add new ones . we describe each &amp; GUI ; element in it :
here you can enter the search path . when adding plug@@ ins without a location use &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; this path to search the plug @-@ in .
many people often work on a project in a sort of hierarch@@ ical relationship to each other . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; supports the specification of team members and they can be configured with Shift ; F@@ 7 Project Properties dialog .
the name and email entries are self @-@ explan@@ atory . Ni@@ ck@@ name is the nick@@ name of the user and is used for unique identification .
one member can have several roles in the project , such as team leaders and sub @-@ project leaders .
the user can choose from the list of team members who he is . this happens by selecting the team member from the list and pressing the S@@ etze + button . the currently selected member ( their identity ) appears fat after you are : text .
nick@@ names and the setting of your own identity are important in terms of news and comments . see for more information on ann@@ ot@@ ations .
apart from an overview of their team , there is another advantage by recording the members of the team : it can be an event for information to be created for information to the team leaders when something is happening .
event actions are actions that are executed when something happens in the project . an example would be recording the opening and closing of the project , so that later it can be seen how much someone worked on it , or sending a message when a file is backed up , or a script that plays a file into CVS once it is added to the project &amp; etc ;
on the page event configuration of the Shift + F@@ 7 Project Properties dialog , events can be created , edited and deleted .
an email is sent to the add@@ res@@ sees selected in the recipient list . the add@@ res@@ see can be a team or sub @-@ project leader .
notes are special comments in the documents . they differ from normal comments by the following :
input Notes is simple . you can either select the note entry from the Editor context menu or enter the @ ann@@ ot@@ ation keyword in a comment section followed by ann@@ ot@@ ation text .
in this case , the syntax @ ann@@ ot@@ ation ( nick@@ name ) or @ ann@@ ot@@ ation ( role ) , with the nick@@ name of the nick@@ name of the team member , is part of the project : team Manager Area Manager Sub@@ project leaders should be given the corresponding area or sub @-@ project names , as shown in the following examples below .
nick@@ names and roles names are case @-@ sensitive , but spaces around the brackets and the name are invalid .
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; is a development environment for scrip@@ ting and format@@ ting languages , which is DT@@ D @-@ agnos@@ tic and supports web @-@ based format@@ ting and scrip@@ ting languages .
the settings can be reached via the Settings menu . here , only about &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; -@@ specific settings are treated , a short description for the others can be found in .
the settings can be set up using the Qu@@ anta settings ... to be called . this dialog extends over a few pages that are treated one after the other .
the behaviour of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; regarding tags , including car completion , can be changed . entries are :
large / lower case tags : large / lower case of tags inserted automatically . normal size / lo@@ wer@@ case means the tags will be inserted as described in the tags XML files .
large / lower case of attributes : large / lower case of automatically inserted attributes . normal size / lo@@ wer@@ case meaning the attributes are inserted as described in the tag@@ XML files .
optional tags lock automatically : if checked , for tags , for which the closing tag is optional , this immediately after &amp; gt ; inserted .
do not include optional tags : as above for all other tags except simple tags .
automatically update start and end tag : if enabled , the corresponding tag will be changed and vice versa .
automatic replacement of acc@@ ent characters : controls the automatic conversion of acc@@ ented characters into the corresponding coding during typing .
MI@@ ME types : mim@@ et@@ yp@@ es for det@@ ecting various types of files . using the Standard button , the def@@ aults can be restored .
standard character encoding : the encoding of newly created or otherwise opened files ( where the encoding of the file can be passed ) . however , this setting here will be sto@@ cked by the same in the project properties if a project is loaded .
standard DT@@ D : the selected DT@@ D is used for newly created files , or for files whose DT@@ D has not been identified . however , this setting here will be sto@@ cked by the same in the project properties if a project is loaded .
creating a backup copy : &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; creates regular backup copies so that in case of a power failure or crash during the next start of the program , the document can be recovered from this backup . this is not the same as saving the file .
the preview and documentation can be displayed either in the editor pane or in your own view ( or the documentation in a folder ) , which makes it possible to view the documentation , preview and source text at the same time .
reset the window settings to the default back at the next start is useful when the user interface is confused by changing the M@@ DI modes and and@@ o@@ cks / ab@@ utting of views . it corresponds to the --@@ res@@ et@@ layout command line parameters .
the warning field is used to control the display of warnings through the check of no more questions .
the place to change behavior of &amp; V@@ PL ; to change the display of symbols instead of scripts as well as synchronization behavior of V@@ PL and source text view in shared mode . see the different modes see .
here the par@@ ser and the structure tree , representing the illustration of par@@ ser nodes in the document , can be set into details .
in the mouse click on the structure tree , the following action is possible to change the action triggered by clicking on the structure tree with the mouse buttons .
in the Struc@@ tural Tree Settings , the visibility of nodes in the tree , the refresh frequency of the tree when editing and how deep when changing the structure tree can be opened automatically . empty nodes are empty areas in the text , while empty groups are those in which no element has been found in the current document .
the short@@ cuts are group@@ ed in groups , each can be valid for multiple &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; s . this means there can be a valid group for PHP in which the i@@ f@@ clause short@@ cut means something else than in a group valid for Jav@@ ascript .
here the plug @-@ ins can be managed . plug @-@ ins are part @-@ applications of third party , which can be re @-@ used by any node @-@ capable application , at the best known &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; when inser@@ ting a plug @-@ in , the following must be specified :
address : the path to the plugin if it is not in a standard such as $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / li@@ b .
input : this information is passed to the plugin during startup , so it can open the current file , the corresponding folder ( path of the current file ) or the project folder .
load component in &quot; read @-@ only &quot; mode : verify that the plugin refuses to load . only @-@ read K@@ Parts usually deny loading if this option is not selected .
check the plugin : if this is enabled , test &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; if the information entered is correct , then saving the application will enable you to save the entry when the plugin is not available at the moment , but it should be installed later .
for &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; starting with version 3.3 , troubleshooting has been completely re@@ developed . support for the no longer necessary built @-@ in &amp; PHP ; ( 3 ) Deb@@ ug@@ ger has been set , as well as support for DB@@ G de@@ bu@@ gger . instead , a de@@ bu@@ gger plug @-@ in concept has been implemented which enables different implem@@ entations via plug@@ ins .
currently only one plugin is available , the support for the use of &amp; gu@@ bed ; inqu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; included .
the use of the Deb@@ ug@@ ger for a project starts with the selection of a suitable de@@ bu@@ gger plug @-@ in in the project settings . using the Options button next to the Deb@@ ug@@ ger Plugin selection field , the specific settings can be changed .
if a de@@ bu@@ gger is enabled for a project , some additional elements appear in the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; interface :
a view in which the content of monitored variables is displayed . usually appears in the left do@@ ck .
a view where all stops are listed with line numbers and conditions . usually appears in the lower dock .
a view in which the output ( as shown in HTML ) of the de@@ bu@@ gger is shown . usually appears in the bottom dock .
depending on the supported functions of the de@@ bu@@ gger , everything or part of the following functionality is available .
with this action , the connection to the de@@ bu@@ gger , if necessary , is made , or it tells the plugin to listen to Deb@@ u@@ gan@@ try requests . this action is triggered by default when a project is opened that uses a de@@ bu@@ gger , so that normally it does not have to be considered .
the counterpart to Deb@@ ug@@ gen session starts the session . closes the connection to the de@@ bu@@ gger or closes the sound according to requirements .
sends an HTTP request to the server to initiate a de@@ bug request . this is equivalent to using a browser to view the current document . the output of this request is displayed in the Deb@@ ug@@ ger output view .
instruc@@ ts the Deb@@ ug@@ ger to start exec@@ uting the script and continuously send information about the monitored variables as well as the currently executed line . if this happens while the script is stopped , execution will continue . if it is started before a de@@ bug request is started , the script will start with the request .
instruc@@ ts the Deb@@ ug@@ ger to start exec@@ uting the script without having to send information to the variables and the current line number . if this happens , while a script is stopped , execution continues .
the de@@ bu@@ gger performs the next instruction in the script without going into the functions or include .
the de@@ bu@@ gger will execute the next instruction in the script , where possible in functions and include , if possible .
instruc@@ ts the Deb@@ ug@@ ger to pass the instruction and go to the next one as if there is no current one .
opens a dialog where a variable or an expression can be entered which should be monitored . the monitored value appears in the variable view .
with this dialog , a variable can be entered or a new value of a variable can be set .
&amp; k@@ x@@ s@@ l ; is a work by Keith Is@@ dale as well as this part of the documentation . &amp; k@@ x@@ s@@ l ; is a &amp; k@@ de ; front end and a part of x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g which they can find on ht@@ t@@ p : / / x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g.@@ s@@ f.@@ net with many other works of Keith .
this chapter describes how to customize &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; to suit your needs and how to help &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; help to become better .
document type editing packages ( D@@ TE@@ P ; s ) are used in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; to provide support for mark@@ up and scrip@@ ting languages as well as &amp; CSS ; their simplicity and flexibility makes aus &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; a fast , user @-@ friendly &amp; IDE ; for web developers , easy to use and productive .
&amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; s exist in two types , family 1 , the Mark@@ up languages and family 2 , the script languages or &amp; CSS ; s &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; s consist of two file types , file &amp; descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; and Tag@@ XML files with suff@@ ix .@@ tag@@ .@@ Tool@@ bars are handy , symbolic past@@ es of image buttons ( above the editing window ) , which insert text and instructions more quickly into a document than a user ever could .
&amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; s can be created manually ( see below ) , downloaded or automatically created from an existing DT@@ D . see for details about the conversion .
this document describes how to create Tag@@ XML files , then the descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; and also tool@@ bars . in short , a &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; .
Tag@@ XML files ( .@@ tag ) define both the specific attributes for tags as well as the layout and contents of the properties dialog , the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; file contains the rules and information of the &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; even . tool bars allow quick inser@@ ting of tags in a document without danger of a writer .
tag folders are nothing but folders . they contain only the descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; and the Tag@@ XML files . tag folders bear the name of the description language and version , so present . ( for example , html @-@ 4.@@ 01 @-@ strict )
the table below lists the elements of the tag XML and declares whether they are necessary , or not . although not all are necessary , it is advisable to use as many as possible so that other users have a better insight and more information about working with them .
the following chapter describes each element in detail . everything about the possibilities and limits is explained in a simple way .
this is the root element of a tag XML document . it can only occur once in a document . it can contain the definition of many tags , but it contains nothing else than just element type .
the type of the tag is a script function . when using , &amp; lt ; att@@ r &gt; is an argument of the function . ( only Family 2 )
only valid for tag type class . the name of the base class for this class . ( only family 2 )
only valid for the type method . specifies the name of the class where this method belongs . ( only family 2 )
if yes , the tag has a common attribute and attributes within this tag can be added to any other tag . ( only family 1 )
sets a text in the dialog . this text is determined by the &amp; lt ; text &gt; tag . this is a only element type element .
describes an attribute of a tag . this element can only occur once for each attribute . it specifies the name and type of the attribute . additionally , there are other tags describing how this attribute is to be displayed &amp; etc ; This is a only element type element .
returns the source code used for filling in the tag editor dialog and in the attribute tree
requires source = d@@ co@@ p . the d@@ co@@ p interface within &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; will be used to achieve source data .
requires source = d@@ co@@ p and the name of an interface . the d@@ co@@ p method name within &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; is used to achieve the data source .
requires source = d@@ co@@ p , a interface and a method name . the arguments passed to the method can be empty or % tag@@ name % , which means the name of the current tag .
a container tag that groups the elements of a list . it can occur only once for an attribute description . it is an element type element .
specifies the position of the attribute text of a tag within a dialog . this tag can only occur once for each attribute in a dialog ( e.g. once for each &amp; lt ; att@@ r &gt; tag ) . the element is empty .
specifies the position and size of a field in the dialog . this tag should be present for each field in the dialog once ( e.g. one for each &amp; lt ; att@@ r &gt; and &amp; lt ; label &gt; Tag ) . this element is empty .
specifies a list of elements that may occur within the tags to be defined . this element is a only element type .
specifies a list of elements that end a day . this element is an only element type .
all tag XML files must start with an &amp; XML ; declaration : &amp; lt ; ? XML version = 1.0 encoding = U@@ TF @-@ 8 ? &gt; and must be properly ch@@ ained and closed .
spaces influence nothing , but be careful &amp; lt ; characters . these should be replaced by &amp; lt ; tool@@ tip &gt; , &amp; lt ; know ; wh@@ ats@@ this &gt; , and &amp; lt ; text &gt; will be replaced .
to check the Tag@@ XML files , the Tools dialog is dialog at the top of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; -@@ Window to start and check Tag@@ XML . another dialog will appear whose simple instructions are to follow .
this function is currently not available yet . currently , the verification only takes place when loading the Tag@@ XML files in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us .
in the following an example of a family 1 tag XML file . this file describes the &amp; lt ; schema &gt; element from the &amp; W@@ 3@@ C ; &amp; XML ; schema . the fil@@ en@@ ame for this Tag@@ XML file should be schem@@ a.@@ tag .
the following is an example of a working family of 2 Tag@@ XML file . in this file , a &amp; PHP file is described ; the fil@@ en@@ ame of this Tag@@ XML file is to be over@@ load@@ .@@ tag .
&amp; lt ; ? XML version = &quot; 1.0 &quot; encoding = &quot; U@@ TF @-@ 8 &quot; ? &gt; &amp; lt ; tag name = &quot; function &quot; re@@ turn@@ key = &quot; function &quot; re@@ turn@@ key = &quot; optional &quot; / &gt; &amp; lt ; / tag &gt; &amp; lt ; / tags &gt;
the descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; file is just as simple and there is an editor to be accessible via DT@@ D editing DT@@ D settings . this allows di@@ ed@@ es@@ cri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; for a file descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; for a newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; should be created a simple &amp; descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; with the following entries :
&#91; general &#93; Version = 3.@@ 1.2 and 2 for each higher version . name = DT@@ D statement . ( - / / W@@ 3@@ C ; / / DT@@ D HTML 4.@@ 01 Transi@@ tional / / EN ) Ni@@ ck@@ name = The simplified name of the DT@@ D . ( HTML 4.@@ 01 Transi@@ tional ) . if not specified , the name is used as nick@@ name .
an action can be set with settings actions ... created . clicking New Action leads to the same dialog :
the short@@ cut assigned to this action . by clicking the Custom Button you can assign a short@@ cut ; with K@@ 1 the current short@@ cut table can be removed .
the simplest actions . a text can be entered in the defined settings and in the execution of the action , this text is inserted in the document at the current cursor position . see the example below .
this is the most powerful type of action . with the help of this action , external applications ( usually scripts , but it is not limited ) that change the document or use it as input ( or parts of the document ) .
first , the name of the script and the interpreter must be specified . example : SH / home / my@@ Home / my@@ Scrip@@ t.@@ sh .
although qualified paths are allowed , it is recommended to use the % scrip@@ t@@ dir variable in command line like sh % scrip@@ t@@ dir / my@@ Scrip@@ t.@@ sh@@ . This way , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us tries to find the script in the following places : $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / apps / qu@@ anta / scripts in their path : $ PAT@@ H There are other special variable that can be used in the command line :
% f : we are replacing the URL of the current document . in case of a local document file : / from the document name will be removed .
% p@@ id : is replaced with the PID of the running &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; only an instance is running , the text unique is attached to the PID number . this is useful when D@@ CO@@ P is used to control &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; from the external script .
the parameters for this event , usually the file name of the current document or the path to the project file .
in addition to the methods listed above , a script can be input from &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us to the default input . input can be specified in the input field , which is to be sent to the default input . possibilities are :
selected text : the selected range of the document is sent to the script . the % input variable is normally only useful with this setting .
according to the input , the output of the executed application can also be re@@ directed . there are two types of output : standard output , run to standard error output . it can be specified , what should be done with the text written to the standard output by setting the value to the output sel@@ ector output :
if there are many tags in the mark@@ up language , it is recommended to divide the tags in logical groups . it is necessary to create an own toolbar for each group . in a given case , it is not too many , so you can create a toolbar with the name of the mark@@ up .
once a toolbar has been added , you need to add and configure actions . select Settings .
the parts of this window are pretty self @-@ explan@@ atory . press the New Action button at the bottom of the window to start editing mode .
complete all necessary fields and add the tag to the right tool bar .
complete everything and , if the tag has attributes and you are planning to use them , enable dialogue &quot; Edit &quot; when available to enable an input when using the action .
Ig@@ itt ! is that a ug@@ ly symbol . who should remember the action in connection with this symbol ? let us replace it before we have difficulties .
to create a symbol , that the action represents better , we will use &amp; ki@@ con@@ edit ; select from the &amp; K@@ Menu ; , Graphic Show other programs ( or where else it is located in your distribution ) .
&amp; ki@@ con@@ edit ; used by default 32@@ x@@ 32 pixels , but we need 22@@ x@@ 22 . to change this , select Edit size .
please note that the created symbol not only helps you to remember what the action does , but also to all other users of the &amp; D@@ TE@@ P .
in view of the day start , I decided to create a start button as a symbol . by using green ( green is usually called off , fixed , further interpreted ) , or should at least , a message to the user will be sign@@ aled that clicking this symbol is a &amp; lt ; start@@ d ; tag will be inserted in the current document .
after creating the symbol it has to be connected with the action . this is done via the menu with Settings ... ( in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; ) and selecting the desired action . next to the text box is a button , press it .
select the folder where the stored icon is located , select it and confirm with OK .
press the Apply button and continue with other tags , so there are still some , or confirm with OK to complete .
suppose you want to add some common &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; functions to the toolbar , or it should be shared to several groups for a better overview . open the tool bar to set up dialog via Settings Tool@@ bar . make sure that the desired toolbar is selected .
after selecting the element to be added to the toolbar , press the arrow key to the right . this adds the element to the toolbar .
for example , I want a quick way to access the Kon@@ quer@@ or preview . I will select it and add to the toolbar .
please note how the separ@@ ators support group@@ ing . someone who doesn &apos;t know my toolbar might believe that the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; button is the opposite of the start button .
the new toolbar must be tested by using all symbols to make sure everything works .
after New XML does not exist , it will be created in the root folder , but your toolbar ( s ) should be stored in the right folder . please adjust its descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c so that your toolbar will be loaded ( s ) when a file is opened from the appropriate folder .
perhaps the most notable extension of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; for the normal user is the possibility to add documentation for the scrip@@ ting language or the format@@ ting language you like most . therefore , this chapter describes how I create a &amp; PHP ; documentation tree for my personal use .
before you start your own documentation , you could check in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; - Rep@@ osit@@ ory whether someone has done this for you .
there are two parts in this process . first you need to look for an existing documentation for the format@@ ting / script / etc ; language . then you need to create the do@@ cr@@ c file .
# K@@ DE Con@@ figuration file &#91; Tree &#93; Do@@ c dir = path , relative to this file , for example ph@@ p@@ 42 / # elements in the main index top element = your description for these documents e.g. &amp; PHP ; 4.2 Docum@@ ents Section 1 = Sec@@ tion@@ 1.@@ html Sec@@ 2.1 = Sec@@ 2.@@ 1.@@ html tag 1 = func@@ tions@@ 1 = func@@ .@@ html tag@@ 1 = day 1.@@ html tag@@ 2 = tag@@ 2@@ html tag@@ 3 = day 3.@@ html
the tree section defines the visible part of the documentation in the documentation tree . for example , see in the &amp; PHP documentation :
# K@@ DE Con@@ fig File &#91; Tree &#93; Do@@ c dir = ph@@ p@@ 42 / # top level element element = PHP 4.2 documentation PHP 4.@@ documentation = Table of Cont@@ ents , # Get@@ ting Star@@ ted , # Language Reference = basic syntax , ... Basic syntax = langu@@ age@@ .@@ basic syntax ...
note the # prior to Get@@ ting Star@@ ted and Language Reference . this indicates that it is a sub@@ folder in the tree with its own content . there is no known limit for the depth of the box ( except by reason ) m@@ d@@ ash ; but try it out for yourself .
note that the table of contents is refer@@ enced directly to a file ( and consequently at the top of the tree view &amp; m@@ d@@ ash ; folder is displayed ! ) .
spaces do not affect , but be careful &amp; lt ; characters . these should be replaced by &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; in all &amp; XML ; -@@ based &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; resource files will be replaced .
the content section is the area of the do@@ cr@@ c file , which serves to create context @-@ sensitive help . by selecting the function name and pressing C@@ trl ; H for context help , the documentation is displayed directly . there are only two types of entries here : the context list ( Con@@ text@@ List ) and the file binding lines .
a simple list of context elements that should be available ( for &amp; PHP ; these are the functions of &amp; PHP ; ) .
now you can save your file do@@ cr@@ c to $ HO@@ ME / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / qu@@ anta / doc or $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / apps / qu@@ anta / doc for local or global use . then create a folder ( as specified in your file do@@ cr@@ c ) in the same folder as do@@ cr@@ c and copy your HTML documentation to it .
if you are sure that these are good and worthy to be shared , send your do@@ cr@@ c files with a description of important information , e.g. which documentation was used to the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; community . you will not get rich , but be proud to have worked with the best web development platform .
with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; you are not alone . it is possible to share the waste resources ( D@@ TE@@ P packages , tool lists with actions , scripts , templates ) with others . there are two ways to do this :
the resources can be sent by e @-@ mail to friends , partners or anyone else . at different places there is an Email menu entry like DT@@ D DT@@ D package ( D@@ TE@@ P ) with email , send tool lists toolbar with email , in the context menu of files and folders in templates and in the scripts tree .
the resources can be uploaded to our main archive , from where all the others &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; users can download them . to make a valid contribution we recommend to sign the resources for which it needs a G@@ PG / P@@ GP key . thus , the origin of the resources is ensured , both for our team and for the later users .
when up@@ loading , you are asked for their pas@@ sp@@ hr@@ ase for their private g@@ pg key ( the pas@@ sp@@ hr@@ ase is not saved ) , or in the event that you have multiple keys you can choose one . in the New resource dialog , the input fields must be filled out ( URL preview can remain empty ) and start up@@ loading by clicking OK .
up@@ loading can be uploaded from the DT@@ D DT@@ D package ( D@@ TE@@ P ) menu , Up@@ loading Tool@@ bar Tool@@ bar , and started in the context menu of files and folders in the templates and scripts tree .
after downloading a resource , before installation , examine &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; the integrity of the resource by checking integrity and signing . in case of problems it is warning and it can then be cancelled . please note the warning messages carefully . if the integrity is given and the resource is signed correctly , a message appears with the indication of the source of the resource .
it is possible to work in XML languages , which are currently not yet supported by &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; however , creation can be time @-@ consuming because hundreds of tag files could be necessary in tag@@ XML format . there is the easiest way to automatically convert a DT@@ D into a D@@ TE@@ P package .
the conversion can be started from the DT@@ D Menu and Con@@ vert a DT@@ D . select the .@@ d@@ t@@ d file with the DT@@ D description to be used . after that the following dialog appears :
target directory name : the newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; is written with this name in the $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / d@@ te@@ p folder .
! doc@@ type Defini@@ tions line : the string that will appear in ! doc@@ type Tag , such as HTML PU@@ B@@ LI@@ C - / / W@@ 3@@ C / / DT@@ D HTML 4.@@ 01 Transi@@ tional / / EN ht@@ t@@ p : / / www.@@ w@@ 3.@@ org / TR / HTML@@ 4 / loos@@ e.@@ d@@ t@@ d
fine adjustment of the D@@ TE@@ P after conversion : when enabled , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; after conversion the descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; editor , with the details of the newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; it is recommended to use this option .
in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; there are some key concepts . to understand them and to get full benefit from &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us , you must first famili@@ arise yourself with these fundamental concepts .
in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; the working area is divided into three areas : global , locally and project @-@ related . this distinction concerns a number of components in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; .
global elements are available for everyone , the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; all that is considered global is stored in the common folder structure of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us . this allows the group of administrators to secure different toolbar , actions and patterns in the global tree , which are then available to everyone in a multi @-@ user environment on the system .
local elements represent a personal collection of web development tools for a single user . these are user @-@ specific patterns and tool@@ bars . local elements are stored in the user directory so that they can only use this user personally .
project @-@ related elements are available only within a specific project . this can be anything from &amp; CSS ; patterns to tool@@ bars with special actions especially for the files of a particular project . simply put , this is the most limited size . all elements are stored in the folder tree of the project , which em@@ o@@ g@@ lows the common use of special tools and samples from all employees within the project .
the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; -@@ M@@ DI ; consists of some main areas : the editor window , the building man@@ ners , the index tabs with information and tool bars . please suggest in , and for further information on these areas .
you can click the tab with the right mouse button to get a context menu with the current document matching entries , such as closing the current , other or all the tabs , rel@@ o@@ ad , delete or upload the document , jump to a book@@ mark or execution of CVS commands to the current document .
right clicking in the editor pane will lead to a further context menu with regard to the edited document content , such as basic editing steps ( cut / copy / paste ) , edit the tags under the mouse cursor , or open the file , if the string is called a file under the mouse cursor .
at the top of the editor window are the tool@@ bars of the editor . currently , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; &amp; HTML ; 4.@@ 01 Transi@@ tional as standard for which a set of tool bars is shown . in the course of further expansion of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us , the tool bars are adapted to the new functions and related user requirements .
the use of tool bars is really easy . if you want to insert a single day , e.g. &amp; lt ; insert into your document , then click the icon representing the tag . now you can insert the data for this just inserted day . if you want to insert a tag that has multiple attributes ( such as anchor ) , you can fill in a dialog box .
the Bau@@ man@@ ners ( Q@@ IT ; ) allow for information on &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; to navigate , to open and ro@@ am . in the presentation with index guides are available for files , project , sample templates , document structure , scripts , attributes and documentation .
project Management is a powerful tool that provides &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; this view shows all files in the project and allows managing the files in the project by right @-@ clicking . actions such as addition , removal , up@@ loading or dele@@ tion of the files from the storage media can be done using the context menu displayed .
another possibility of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; is the use of templates . almost everything can be a template : pictures , program parts , a whole website , etc ; there are all options open to you .
templates can be divided into three categories depending on the context they are used . global templates are always available , local templates are always available , local templates only for the respective user and templates in projects can only be used in the project .
here you can find information about the available scrip@@ ting languages . the concept of structure in Global , Local and Project works here too . by clicking with the left mouse button you can access the available information to a script . by clicking with the left mouse button you can access the available information to a script .
with this view , the internal structure of the active document is displayed . by clicking an element , the cursor is placed in the document on the position of the element . by right @-@ clicking an element , a list of commands opens in relation to navigation and refresh of the tree .
this tree appears among the other tree views . with it , you can quickly change attributes and nam@@ esp@@ aces . the application system aligned to the content allows you to change all available attributes with just a few mouse clicks .
here is the complete documentation on web technology for your development . you can download pre @-@ packed documentation for &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; from the qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; &apos; documentation site , you can create your own documentation , and by adding a folder doc to a project can add , edit and view project @-@ specific documentation .
by default , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; two tabs at the bottom of the window that can be accessed via the beneficial information : the message window and the problem window .
this tab shows information about each script running in Qu@@ anta . for example , the currently used DT@@ D of the current document and all changes to DT@@ D are displayed .
this tab shows all errors in the current document &apos;s mark@@ up . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; -@@ scripts that are executed give all error messages ( so there are ) in this window .
the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; tool bars are extensively expanded and easy to understand . show them on a symbol and they get the corresponding command . the chocolate page of the toolbar is the option to define your own commands as symbols in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us .
another function of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; is the ability to send a tool bar by e @-@ mail . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; sends the toolbar as compressed tar archive via &amp; k@@ mail ; if you receive a tool bar in an email , you can backup and load it in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; like any other file !
it is reasonable if you want to customize the location of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; for this auto@@ conf has a number of options that can be passed to the configure script . to get a complete list of all options , type . / configure --@@ help . the options are simple to understand and not executed here .
if you have trouble starting &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us , you should check if your path contains the &amp; k@@ de ; 3 bin folder . also , you should make sure that is not an older version of &amp; k@@ de ; 3 in the PAT@@ H before its bin folder . the same applies to &amp; Q@@ t ; .
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; is a web development tool for the K@@ DE desktop . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; has been optimized for rapid web development and combines a mature development environment with a variety of powerful features .
while trying to create the best &amp; HTML ; editor , the developers of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us began to deal with an obvious idea : what would be if &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; a stand@@ alone , exten@@ sible mark@@ up language editor ? well , this would make it the absolutely great web development tool for &amp; k@@ de ; so it was done .
no longer restricted to pure &amp; HTML ; limited , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; now far on the way to a general and comprehensive web development tool . summari@@ zed : if you can define it in &amp; XML ; then should &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; for that the appropriate &amp; IDE ; be .
well , to the aforementioned claim must be held that &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; as a product based on the outstanding efforts of the entire &amp; k@@ de ; developer community based . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; follows , in good application of free software , the idea of Why Develop@@ ing what someone else has developed ?
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; allows web developers to use an intuitive and powerful multi @-@ document interface ( M@@ DI ; ) . this can dramatically increase productivity . by means of self @-@ kn@@ itted actions , scripts and tool@@ bars , automation is possible almost every task .
&amp; Qu@@ anta ; Plus ; is a web development environment for HTML and related languages . it was designed for fast web development and quickly became a mature editor with many powerful functions .
&amp; Qu@@ anta ; Plus is in no way associated with commercial versions of &amp; Qu@@ anta ; the original developers left the GP@@ L licensed version and produced a commercial program .
more details in the details are with help : / Qu@@ anta ( either enter this URL in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; or execute hel@@ p@@ center help : / Qu@@ anta ) .
&amp; Qu@@ anta ; is currently being developed and supervised by Eric L@@ aff@@ ai Sequ@@ itur @ k@@ de@@ .org and Andr@@ as Man@@ tia am@@ anti@@ a @ k@@ de@@ .org .
a quick access list of files that you have opened . this list changes every time you open a file that is not on it , with the oldest entry removed .
this allows you to save code parts and whole files as templates for later use . if you are trying to save the selected file / text outside the local / project template folder , only one error is reported .
converts special characters to &amp; HTML while inser@@ ting from the clip@@ board there , so that they are displayed correctly and not mis@@ understood by the browser as format@@ ting instructions .
converts text from clip@@ board in &amp; URL ; depreciation , which is the correct way to insert specific characters and spaces in &amp; URL ; s . primarily used for inser@@ ting &amp; URL ; s into the anchor tag .
switches the block selection to / off . this allows you to select text blocks using the &amp; Shift key .
go directly to a line number . this is very helpful if your &amp; PHP ; script gives error messages !
searches a string or regular expression in the selected directory . a kind of gre@@ p or sed with GUI and pre@@ defined expressions to help you .
displays the message window or not . this is the window in which you can see the display of scrip@@ tions and de@@ bu@@ gger .
initial and switching on the problem repor@@ ter at the bottom of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; main window . the problem repor@@ ter is activated once you switch to the structure tree .
displays the toolbar icons to the left of the main window . this column allows you to set book@@ marks with a click of the mouse .
if there are book@@ marks in the current file , they will appear in the menu along with the entries Previous or Next , depending on the cursor position in the document .
book@@ marks from other opened documents appear in the menu group@@ ed according to the fil@@ en@@ ame of the other documents .
opens an existing project from the hard drive . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; projects are saved with the extension .@@ web@@ pr@@ j .
presents a dialog for inser@@ ting files into the current project . the selected files will then be copied to the project directory .
searches the project directory for new files that could be there . that allows , for example , to copy graphic files to your project folder or sub@@ folder and then add them to the project .
loads the files in your project on the server . the list of available transport methods depends on your version of &amp; k@@ de ; from and if you have downloaded more input / output modules ( K@@ IO slaves ) .
settings like &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; the project manages . in chapter &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; -@@ Projects you will find details .
loads a project tool bar . these are stored in project dir / tool@@ bars and are only available in this menu if you have assigned them to this project .
a dialog to save your toolbar . allows you to select the type of toolbar : locally or project .
open a dialog to add a new toolbar . actions must be created by setting up actions ... added . tool boxes will be saved through toolbar buttons , or you will be asked when you exit if you want to save the toolbar .
if you haven &apos;t saved the toolbar , you &apos;ll be asked if you want to do that .
this allows you to send your own toolbar to someone ( perhaps to the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; team so that the toolbar is in the next release ) . the menu item opens a new email message with the toolbar as app@@ endi@@ x .
enables up@@ loading of tool slides to the main server , where everyone else can access it .
load a &amp; DT@@ D ; which you or anyone else has made and convert to the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; own description format .
load / refresh the entities from the &amp; DT@@ D ; it makes sense if the entities from the &amp; D@@ TE@@ P are to be fresh@@ ened without the entire &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; if this is global and a write permission in the global K@@ DE folder is not present , the load fails .
this menu contains a list of tags that are present in the currently loaded tool@@ bars . if the default ( HTML ; ) tool bar is loaded , there is a sub@@ menu standard in the Tags menu which contains the list of tags / actions on this toolbar .
allows access to the current day settings dialog when there is one . this entry is always present in the Tags menu , followed by &amp; DT@@ D ; -@@ specific sub@@ menus .
activated or de@@ activ@@ ates the intelligent inser@@ ting of tags . currently , this only works with ( X ) HTML DT@@ Ds . intelligent inser@@ ting means that &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; the insertion by means of tool bar is denied when this day contradic@@ ts the rules in this place .
in the Plugins menu , the available plug@@ ins are listed under the above menu items . click on it . click on an activated plug @-@ in de@@ activ@@ ates it .
sel@@ ects the syntax high@@ lighting mode for the current file . the list of available high@@ lighting schemes depends on der@@ k@@ ate ; version .
very useful when you know people using other OS platforms to develop . choose Unix , Windows / DOS or Macintosh .
checks the syntax of the current document using the selected &amp; DT@@ D ; using the external application ti@@ dy .
immediate switching between the different types of user interface . due to some limitations in the K@@ DE libraries , switching may sometimes need time or create unpleasant graphics . recommended is the card card mode , which is also the default setting , or the sub@@ window mode , which corresponds to the representation in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; 3.2 and earlier .
in addition , this menu contains an entry for each open sub @-@ window . selecting an entry will activate the corresponding sub@@ window .
switches the status bar display at the bottom of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; main window .
the changes in this dialog affect any application that uses the K@@ HTML part , including the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; web browser .
set up the behavior of the editor window . in the documentation of &amp; k@@ ate ; you will find details .
a dialog appears where you delete entries from the toolbar , or which you can add and change the sequences .
this should generate a help according to the environment of the mouse poin@@ ter , but is not yet implemented .
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; is a high quality product that is freely available and freely licensed , but as with any open source project developers can always use help . if they want to support the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; development in financial form , they find the way here .
the fields are self @-@ explan@@ atory and should preferably be completed from top to bottom , since the entire directory structure is automatically completed for the rest of the project , e.g. after completing the project name . all of these paths and author information fields can later be adjusted with Shift + F@@ 7 Project Properties .
here is the name for the project , for example fo@@ o . when entering the name , file is filled in automatically .
this is the name of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; project file . by default , it has the name of the project in lo@@ wer@@ case letters and without spaces with extension web@@ pr@@ j ( e.g. f@@ oo@@ .@@ web@@ pr@@ j ) . this file is stored in the project directory .
here is the server address of the machine you want to access , except you can edit local data . either a name ( host@@ nam@@ e.@@ exempl@@ .de ) or an IP address ( 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 ) are possible .
if you leave this field empty , the default settings of the selected protocol will be used . depending on the setting of the remote host , an adjustment might be necessary .
this is the folder where the templates are stored for the project . it is a relative path to the project and by default templates . if a shared collection of files is used for different projects , this folder should be set instead of the standard .
this is the folder where tool@@ bars are stored for the project . it is a relative path to the project and default tool@@ bars . if a shared collection of files is used for different projects , this folder should be set instead of the standard .
this allows to insert files from the local file system into the project . multiple files or entire folders can be selected .
this setting is great if you have static web content you want to download and change . for server @-@ side scripts ( e.g. &amp; PHP ; , Python , &amp; etc ; ) you have to proceed differently .
checked if files that are located somewhere in the main folder of the project should be included . if a project is started from scratch , don &apos;t hook up .
with this option , all files and folders will be displayed inside the main folder and you can select a precise selection according to good man@@ ure .
this shows a list of files in the root folder . you can select the desired files by hook or , by removing the check@@ box , clips out of the project .
the last screen of the new project wizard contains three settings that simplify your work . these settings can be uploaded to the Project Properties menu in the File Tree window or Shift + F@@ 7 .
some settings correspond to those in the project wizard and are described in . the additional entries are explained below .
a list of fil@@ en@@ ames ( wild@@ card possible ) , which are ignored for project @-@ related operations such as project folders .
additional options to above , including files listed in .@@ c@@ v@@ sign@@ ore , are excluded from the project .
the project view , which is loaded when the project is opened , can be read more about project views .
this way the desired de@@ bu@@ gger can be selected . currently only G@@ ub@@ ed is supported . more information about G@@ ub@@ ed can be found in . the Deb@@ ug@@ ger plugin can be set using the Options button .
in the profiles of the profiles , high loading profiles ( see in ) can be set , as well as the display of a tree view for the content of the server for each profile , by showing an individual view of each profile .
in the team configuration sub@@ window , project members can be added , edited or deleted as well as a mailing list . see details .
in the event configuration sub@@ window , you can switch event actions and add , modify or delete these actions . event actions are executed when a pre @-@ defined event occurs , such as the backing of a file . see the details .
by default , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; the last project that was opened . you can &apos;t influence this behavior at the moment .
to open a different project , select project ... from the menu project or the icon project open from the toolbar . the dialog project will be displayed and allows the selection of a project . projects have .@@ web@@ pr@@ j as extension .
if &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; closed , the project file will be saved automatically . you &apos;ll be asked if you want to save changes before leaving , if &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; changed files . the same happens when you load a new project .
project supervision gives free access to the files in the project . there , the files can be managed in the current project .
the folder beha@@ ves as well , but the entries are missing opening and opening with ... in the context menu available with the right mouse button :
various profiles can be selected here . the profile contains information about the location of the uploaded files . see .
allows removal of the current profile . if only one profile exists , the button will be blin@@ ded to prevent the removal .
the password is kept in the core memory and forgotten by the programmer . this option is useful when frequent up@@ loading of files is necessary and the rather uns@@ af@@ e password saved on the disk -@@ option does not come into question .
this will stop the transfer or simply leave the dialog when you change your mind before up@@ loading .
in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; many high loading profiles can be created , so that the project ( or parts of the project ) can be uploaded to different servers . when editing or creating a profile , this dialog is displayed :
this is the name of the server on which the files should be copied . either a fully qualified domain name or an IP address will work .
the Transfer Protocol for up@@ loading . the list depends on the version of &amp; k@@ de ; and the installed ki@@ o slaves . at least you should choose from &amp; FTP ; , file ( local ) and n@@ fs .
the port for the transfer . normally , this does not need to be changed , except the network administrator does not operate a service at the usual port .
depending on your fear threshold , this is either a time @-@ saving function or a danger . use it at your discretion . the password is stored on the disk , so it cannot be read easily , but everyone with programming knowledge can easily see it in plain text .
a project view is only a set of files and tool slides . there can be many views in a project , i.e. by simply changing the view various files and tool@@ bars can be loaded and replace the currently opened files and tool@@ bars .
views can be stored , opened or deleted in the project or project toolbar , accessible via Settings Tool@@ bar project toolbar .
this chapter describes the parts of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; with which one has the most to do . this not only helps to increase productivity but also allows the adjustment of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; to the own working method .
as mentioned above , tool bars in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us are best designed using the tool toolbar . use and addition differ . adding tool bars is treated at the bottom of the section Add tool@@ bars .
the toolbar and the symbols on it can be set either using the context menu ( right @-@ click on the toolbar ) , other actions such as tool@@ bars can be removed , toolbar buttons or tool@@ bars can be executed , which can be specified in the dialog , where the actions on this or other toolbar can be visible .
by calling the context menu to an action ( symbol ) on a toolbar , the entries will be removed and action processed , which are self @-@ explan@@ atory .
the toolbar and actions on them can be set up in the Settings menu ... and set Settings ...
templates are basically document skel@@ et@@ ons , code sni@@ pp@@ ets and files to link . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; use templates basically like a common file system with advanced organization and interfaces . you can copy , move or link any existing directory into the template tree . templates have in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; in about the restrictions you present for the file system .
some with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; provided templates have conditions for their use . please read the conditions specified at the beginning of each template before use .
binary templates are usually inserted in documents using links ( e.g. images with im@@ g sr@@ c = / sr@@ c / ur@@ l ) . some examples can be found in the template tree under global templates .
documents can be from any text document type . based on these templates , new documents can be created . normally , more specific documents can be created in appropriate sub@@ folders . some examples can be found in the template tree under global templates . see for more information on the template tree .
this type of template is useful if not a new document based on a template but the same text area should be included in the document again and again . you can find everything from a comment on a final note up to a complete menu system on Jav@@ ascript or Perl .
as the name says , these templates serve entire websites as templates . they are a collection of various documents that can be organized in a folder structure , summari@@ zed in a compressed tar archive . currently there are no examples in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; .
design a document structure at will ( XML ; , &amp; HTML ; , Doc@@ Book &amp; etc ; ) and select File As a template , save as a local template ....
once this has happened , notice that ( even if it was saved as a project template ) , the template is not visible in the project tree .
select text in your document and click File As a template , save as a local / project template . alternatively , you can simply drag and drop them to the tree view template .
the creation of binary templates is simple : the file can only be copied to a template folder . it allows all file management functions to be used , such as pulling and dropping or past@@ ing over the con@@ quer@@ or file tree .
in the file tree or in the project files you can click on a folder to the right and create a site template , enter a name for the template and secure it . by default , it is saved in the project folder , but of course it can be stored as a local or global template .
project templates allow a very target @-@ oriented approach . you can present head@@ lines and foot@@ ers , or dynamic with &amp; PHP ; design , paste or link with them . in addition , you can keep an eye on some things when using templates in projects .
the template structure in the sub@@ window templates is based on the files laid in $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / apps / qu@@ anta / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / qu@@ anta / templates . each of these folders corresponds to one of four types of containers as explained above .
to specify the behavior of a folder , right click the folder and select Properties in the context menu . the following dialog appears :
a selection box with the three previously described types ; files , text or templates . this selection is blin@@ ded as soon as el@@ ter@@ ial attributes are adverti@@ sed .
this is enabled by default and fits all except the master folders in the template list . if a root folder would be configured in such a way , it would de@@ activate the templates in this path , unless they are explicitly enabled . if nothing appears , you will probably find yourself in a root folder .
allows leading or later text templates for templates in this folder . this might be general he@@ aders or foot@@ ers for all templates for a particular project and allows to copy content templates to a folder with special he@@ aders / foot@@ ers a whole presentation already with the appropriate he@@ aders / foot@@ ers .
in addition , the context menu ( pointing , right mouse button ) has a complete command collection for adding folders or copying and past@@ ing templates from one place to another .
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; provides two modes : V@@ PL ; -@@ Editor and V@@ PL ; &amp; source text editor that can be reached via the View menu . the first mode replaces the source text editor by the V@@ PL ; Editor and the second divi@@ des the editor window into two parts : the source text editor and the V@@ PL ; editor .
the V@@ PL ; Editor works as follows : it loads a document like a normal &amp; HTML ; - or &amp; X@@ HTML ; page and a cursor appears . then you can edit and turn back to source code editor where the changes made in the V@@ PL ; Editor in the source code are visible .
when working with the V@@ PL ; Editor on a document that contains &amp; PHP ; it is not possible to edit it directly with the V@@ PL ; -@@ Source . it is not possible to edit it directly using the V@@ PL ; to edit it , the source text editor is still necessary . there are no plans to change this behavior .
the second mode works just like the first one , except that at the same time the changes are both in the source text editor and in the V@@ PL ; editor is running synchron@@ ously . with pressing F@@ 9 this mode is activated , this mode is active , the key press releases the active cursor from one window to another , while maintaining the position in the document .
the synchronization distance between the V@@ PL ; Editor and the source code editor is adjustable via Settings Qu@@ anta . after choosing V@@ PL , you can choose between synchronization after one click or automatically . in principle , the time span can be set automatically .
suppose you want to change the title of the website , so the editing of invisible tags is possible when working with the V@@ PL ; Editor . the document properties dialog is also called when a new document is created using the V@@ PL ; this serves to reduce the manual coding . this allows you to change the following :
met@@ a tags allow storing information about the document itself , e.g. keywords for Internet search engines . met@@ a elements can be added or removed by pressing the two buttons below . a click into the list allows the change of contents , e.g. keywords on the column name and keyword 2 on the content column .
CSS rules are the new way to design the pages in your browser . you can add or delete CSS rules with the buttons below the list . a change over the list is possible just as with the Met@@ a elements . editing CSS rules is currently not supported .
it is possible to include an external CSS style template by pressing the File Open button and selecting the appropriate file .
using the cursor is possible as in a word processor , by moving with arrows . under rare circumstances the cursor beha@@ ves odd . the marking works as usual . text can be inserted by typing and dropped by pressing button or ran@@ ge@@ button .
inser@@ ting tags is done in the same way via the toolbar , as in the source text editor . it is to be noted that inser@@ ting tags already existing identical tags will not be removed , e.g. when an anchor tag , surrounded with text , must be removed any other surrounding anchor tag .
some tool bars such as the table assistant or the list assistant are disabled . they will work later in &amp; V@@ PL ; in this release , the tables or lists must be used tool@@ bars .
&amp; x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g ; is a tool for analy@@ zing style sheets . unlike other style sheets , searching for certain elements is possible and the style sheet can be traced .
to be able to compile successfully , you need except &amp; k@@ de ; the libraries lib@@ x@@ s@@ lt , li@@ be@@ x@@ s@@ lt and lib@@ x@@ ml , which are already present in a typical installation of &amp; k@@ de .
new to x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g 3.@@ 1.4 : in g@@ db compatibility mode , orph@@ aned stops can be set in a particular file and line number and later enabled .
x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g returns the complete path from a fil@@ en@@ ame without a path . fil@@ en@@ ames in the same folder as the top loaded style file name with relative path to working folder con x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g is , for example , a style document file .. / en / x@@ sl@@ doc@@ .x@@ s@@ l loaded , the following entry is possible :
in this command , a partial or total agreement is checked with either the my@@ QNA@@ ME or a specified model name . &amp; eg ; template matches with any my@@ QNA@@ P@@ cloud that includes the template template .
each nam@@ esp@@ ace in the named &quot; QNAP &quot; is extended according to the rules defined by the nam@@ esp@@ ace defined in the X@@ SL source file . x@@ s@@ l : test@@ 1 becomes &amp; eg ; expanded to ht@@ t@@ p : / / www.@@ w@@ 3.@@ org / 19@@ 9 / X@@ SL / Trans@@ form : test@@ 1
a desired holding point must be resolved for the associated UR@@ I and line number . this is done automatically when loading the first template by x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g . stops are checked again shortly after the start of each iter@@ ation .

there are many graphical tools to compare . so why &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; ? let me briefly explain why I wrote .
the merge was very complicated because one of the contribut@@ ors made many changes and at the same time corrected the ind@@ entation at many places . another programmer had changed a lot of text in the same file . the result was numerous conflicts when merging .
the program I used showed me only the changed lines , but I could not see what exactly changed within these lines . and there was no reference to the places where perhaps only the ind@@ entation had changed . the merging of these changes was a small night@@ mare .
that was the beginning . the first version of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; could display differences within one line and changes to white characters . later , lots of other useful functions were added .
for example , if you want to compare text quickly , simply copy it to the clip@@ board and insert it in one of the comparison boxes .
a function that made a lot of work was the comparing and merging of folders . this function converted &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; almost into a full @-@ fle@@ dged file browser .
also 3 @-@ way merging is fully supported . this is useful when two people work independently of one piece of code and make changes . the original file ( the base ) helps to resolve conflicts and simultaneously displays the expected result . in this editor you can even edit the result directly . in this editor you can even edit the result directly . the screen@@ shot shows three source files when merging :
&amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; also helps you to compare and merge entire folders . this screen@@ shot shows &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; when assembling :
&amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; shows the exact differences and is based on the possibilities of today &apos;s color monitors . if you frequently need to check codes , you will like this function .
differences in white characters and tabs are displayed visible . if rows only differ in a certain number of white characters , you can see it at a glance at the summary in the column at the left . ( no more trouble if someone changes the ind@@ entation . )
if a file is the same and the other differs in one line , then the color indicates which file is different . red color means that both are different .
if all files have the same name , but in different folders , you can make the typing work easier by writing only the fil@@ en@@ ame of the first file . example :
k@@ diff@@ 3 Fol@@ der 2 Fol@@ der 2 Fol@@ der 2 Fol@@ der 2 Fol@@ der 2 Fol@@ der 2 Fol@@ der 2 Fol@@ der 2 Fol@@ der 2 Fol@@ der 2 Fol@@ der 2 Fol@@ der 2 Fol@@ der 2 Fol@@ der 3 Fol@@ der 3 -@@ o target folders
opening dialog allows manual typing of file names , selecting a file browser ( file ... ) or selecting an last opened file from the drop @-@ down list . the opening dialog will notice your selection and display it again next time . you do not have to specify a third file ; if you leave the entry for C , the analysis of the differences will be done with two files .
through the button Fol@@ der ... you can also select a folder . if you select a folder , the same or merging folders will be initiated . however , if a file is selected for A , for B and C , then use a folder , then use &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the fil@@ en@@ ame from A in the two other folders .
if merging is enabled , the input field is active and can be edited . however , it is not strictly necessary to specify an output file immediately . you can also do this step later when saving .
the setup button opens a dialog with Settings . here you can set options before you start the merge / merge .
sometimes you don &apos;t want to compare a whole file , but only parts of a text . &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; allows you to drag text parts from the clip@@ board into the active comparison window . the comparison starts then immediately . in the Open Di@@ alogue , you do not have to select any files , you can simply close the dialog with the Canc@@ el button .
you can also use drag and drop : simply drag a file from a file manager or selected text from an editor and let it fall over a comparison window .
what is the idea behind it ? sometimes a file contains several similar functions . if you want to find out how similar these functions are , it would be a relatively big effort . you should first create two corresponding files , load them in &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 and then compare them . now you can simply copy , insert and then compare the relevant sections .
note : currently you can do nothing from &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; pull out . only dropping text into a comparison window is supported .
warning : some editors interpret the dra@@ gging and dropping text into another program as cut and paste ( instead of copying and past@@ ing ) . in such a case , your original data could be lost .
the info line of the source pane contains the characters A , B or C , the fil@@ en@@ ame and the line number of the first visible line in the window . ( note that window C is optional . ) Any information line has a different color . ( if the path to a file is too long , leave the mouse to rest for a while above the line . then a small auxiliary window will display the full name . )
the three source windows are assigned the letters A , B and C . a has the color blue , B the color green and C is mag@@ enta . ( these preferences can be changed via the Settings menu . )
when comparing both files , the default color is red . ( color for conflicts in the settings ) . the color scheme is particularly useful when comparing three files . that &apos;s good to see in the next section ( merge ) .
if differences are found , the column displays the corresponding color . if differences in white characters are not so important , it is useful to see only the relevant changes . ( in C / C + + , for example , white characters are only relevant in strings and comments , for the pre@@ processor and in few , rare cases . )
the vertical line separating the summary column from the text is interrupted at the points where the source file has no lines . if the line break is enabled , the line is dotted with dotted lines .
the result window ( among the comparison windows ) also has an info line with the wording output : , the fil@@ en@@ ame and &#91; Change &#93; if you edited the result . usually it contains text by automatic merging , but often it also contains conflicts .
! ! ! until all conflicts are resolved , saving is de@@ activated ! ! ! ( use the buttons S@@ prin@@ ge to find the next resolved / un@@ resolved conflict to find the remaining conflicts . )
if only two comparison windows are used , each difference is at the same time a conflict that must be solved manually .
by clicking with the left mouse button in the drawing column in one of the window the group belonging to the group will be marked in all windows and the first line of the group will be displayed . ( this will also cause a jump in the position in the windows where the beginning of the group would otherwise not be visible . ) This group will be highlighted with the color background color for current area and each on the left appears a black bar .
sometimes there is no more line left in the group by automatic merging or manual editing ; this is only a plac@@ eholder in the case that you change your mind and maybe select another source again . this text does not appear in the final stored file , nor in a marker that you may copy and paste somewhere else .
the text &amp; lt ; merge conflict ; however , appears in the clip@@ board when you copy such text from the result window . be careful with this function .
note : if the options are ignored when selecting the sources , ignor@@ ing ignor@@ es C / C + + comments , changes in figures or comments are also treated as white characters .
navigate mainly with the scroll bars and the mouse , but you can also use the keyboard . if you click in one of the windows , you can use the arrow keys left , right , high , down , side on , side , end , end , C@@ trl @-@ start and C@@ trl @-@ End , Si@@ w as you can also be used by other programs .
in the display window , you can also use the other buttons to edit . with the insertion button you can switch between insert and over@@ write mode . ( pres@@ et is insert mode . )
one click with the left mouse button in one of the sum@@ m@@ aries synchron@@ izes the view of all windows to the beginning of each group ( as explained in the Con@@ merging and the edi@@ table output window ) .
the toolbar contains seven buttons for navigation with which you can jump to the current / first / last difference , to the next / previous conflict ( C@@ trl @-@ Image Up@@ ward / C@@ trl @-@ Image Ab@@ road ) or to the next / previous un@@ resolved conflict .
to copy the mark to the clip@@ board , you need to copy the Copy button ( C@@ trl @-@ C or C@@ trl @-@ In@@ sert ) . if this is enabled , whatever you select will be automatically copied to the clip@@ board and eliminating manual copying . however , be careful with this option , because you could accidentally over@@ write the clip@@ board contents .
line ends are stored according to the underlying operating system . Unix flavors use a line feed character \ , and Win32 @-@ based systems use auto @-@ return + line feed \ \ r \ . K@@ diff@@ 3 does not retain the line end of the source files , so you should not use &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; also not using bin@@ aries .
the options and the list of recently used files will be saved automatically at the end of the operation and restored at the next start . ( menu Settings - &gt; K@@ Diff@@ 3 Set ... )
( on some systems , the dialog also provides fonts with variable width to choose from , but you should not use them . )
if you activate this option , differences will be displayed in ital@@ ics . if the selected font does not support this display , nothing happens .
on systems with only 16 or 256 colors , some colors could not be available in their pure form , but would be rendered as ast@@ ert . on these systems , the Pre@@ ferences Button will automatically create an un@@ just color .
if this option is enabled , the corresponding number of spaces will be inserted when pressing the tab key . otherwise , a tab character will be inserted .
if you press input or return , the return of the previous line will automatically be used for the next line .
when this option is checked , each selection is automatically copied to the clip@@ board . the manual copy to the clip@@ board is om@@ itted then .
you can select which line end type you prefer to save . the default value is the commonly used selection on the operating system used .
the second step compar@@ es each line . the second step compar@@ es each line . in this step white characters are not ignored . even when merging white characters , white characters are not ignored .
some editors ( on some systems ) store a carriage return character \ \ r &apos; and a line feed &apos; \ &apos; at the end of one line , others only save a line feed &apos; \ &apos; . usually , the auto @-@ return marks may look identical , although they are different .
in default , this option is de@@ activated . in the first part of the analysis figures and associated characters ( &apos; 0 &apos; - &apos; 9 &apos; , &apos; . &apos; , &apos; - &apos; ) are ignored .
in default , this option is disabled . changes in comments are treated like changes in white characters .
the option is enabled by default . it is effective for complicated and large files , but slowly with very large files .
in automatic mode , this setting determines how long the result of the selection is displayed before the next un@@ resolved conflict continues .
automatically triggers all conflicts in white characters by using the selected file as source . ( default is manual selection . ) This is useful if white characters are less important in many files . if you only need this from time to time , use the Select A / B / C functions for all un@@ resolved white conflicts from the merge menu .
these options are discussed in the chapter on the scanning of folders and exec@@ uting a merge . look for details under documentation on the directory comparison and merge operation .
if a file is stored and an older version already exists , then the original version will be app@@ ended to the suff@@ ix .@@ ori@@ g . if already such a backup file exists with the suff@@ ix .@@ ori@@ g , it will be deleted without further backup .
adjust the language of the interface . changing this option does not apply to the currently running program . you need &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; quit and restart , so that the change becomes active . ( this option is in the K@@ DE version of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; not available because the language is set global over the control center . )
the following encoding settings can be set separately for each entry . if enabled , the upper setting will be used for all entries .
in the selection fields for encoding , a brief notice appears , which is the local encoding . ( this cannot be changed here and has a purely informal character for you . )
adjust the file encoding for source files . this influences how special characters are treated and interpreted . since encoding is individually configur@@ able for each file , even files with different coding can be compared and merged .
if you have edited a file , you can specify which coding to be used to save .
if you define pre @-@ processing commands , they might not work with your code@@ c . ( for example , your files may be 16 @-@ bit Uni@@ code , but the pre @-@ processing command can only deal with 8 @-@ bit ASCII . ) With this option you can specify the encoding of the output of pre @-@ processing commands .
turn off this to supp@@ ress high@@ lighting changes in white characters in text or review columns . ( note : this also applies to changes in numbers or comments if the options ignore numbers or ignore ignore C / C + + comments . )
this selection is only available if you compare three files . in normal mode , all differences are displayed in a color coded overview column . but sometimes you may only see the differences between two of three files .
sometimes you would like to use the available space on the screen rather for long lines . just open the less important windows . ( this option is in the window menu . )
classi@@ fies the comparison boxes next to each other or over each other . this can also be useful for displaying long lines . ( this option is in the window menu . )
sometimes you view the differences and then decide un@@ expect@@ edly to merge the files . a simple click starts the merge and uses the file name of the last source file as default name for the output file . ( if this function is used to restart the merge , then the name of the last file will be retained . )
when reading a file , it is first passed to this external command . in &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 , then the output of the command is visible , not the file itself . you can write your own pre @-@ processor that corresponds exactly to your requirements .
when reading a file , it is first passed to this external command . if a normal pre @-@ processing command is specified ( see above ) , then the output of the command is the input of this command processing command . you can write your own pre @-@ processor command that corresponds exactly to your needs . each input line must have an associated output line .
the idea behind this is to give the user more flexibility in setting up the di@@ ff results . however , an external program is needed , and most users do not want to program it themselves . however , the good news is that in most cases , sed or per@@ l is sufficient .
use this pre @-@ processing command for line offset to convert the input into capital letters : SE@@ D &apos;s / \ \ ( . * \ \ ) / \ \ U \ \ 1 / &apos; That . * is a real expression of the text found on each string and in this context refers to the found text in the first log file .
the \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \
while you experiment with sed , you may start to understand it and perhaps you may even like these regular expressions . they are very useful because there are many programs that support very similar things .
ignor@@ ing numbers is actually a built @-@ in function in K@@ diff@@ 3 . but it is good as an example for another pre @-@ processing command for line offset . sed &apos;s / &#91; 0@@ 12@@ 3@@ 45@@ 67@@ 8@@ 9.@@ - &#93; / / g &apos; E@@ ach signal between &apos; &#91; &apos; and &apos; &#93; &apos; is a hit , and each hit is replaced by nothing , so quasi cleared .
sometimes you might want to perform several implem@@ entations at once . then you can use the sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on &apos; ; &apos; to separate the compositions from each other . example :
instead of sed you can use something else such as per@@ l -@@ p -@@ e &apos;s / re@@ ge@@ x@@ p / re@@ ge@@ x@@ p / replace / SCH@@ AL@@ TER &apos; How@@ ever , per@@ l needs some details . where sed \ \ ( and \ \ ) , per@@ l needs only ( and ) without the previous &apos; \ \ &apos; . example :
the data after the normal pre@@ processor will be retained for displaying and merging . further operations will only alter the data that the line balance algorithm will look like .
note : in rare cases , if you use a normal pre@@ processor , the line @-@ like pre@@ processor will see the output of the normal pre@@ processor as input .
the pre @-@ processor commands are very useful , but as with any function that changes text or hides differences , you may not notice certain differences and in the worst case destroy important data .
often program@@ mers need to process many files in a folder . for this reason you can compare and merge with &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; complete folders recur@@ sively .
... makes a proposal for each object to merge ; you can adjust the proposal before starting ,
... can simulate the merge and display the simulated changes without actually performing it ,
... performs selected actions either with all ( F@@ 7 key ) , or only with the selected objects ( F@@ 6 key ) ,
this is very similar to comparing and merging single files . you only need to specify folders on the command line or in the dialog file .
when three folders are merged , folder 1 will be used as base . if no destination folder has been specified , &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; Fol@@ der 3 as destination folder .
note that only the comparison of folders automatically starts , not the merge . to start the merge , you need to select the corresponding menu item or press the F@@ 7 key . ( see more details . )
while reading the folder , a small message window will inform you about the current progress . if you cancel the scan , only the files that have been compared to that list will be listed .
when scanning the folder is completed , it shows &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; a list window with the results on the left , ...
each file and folder found during the scan will be displayed here in a tree . you can select an object with a simple mouse click .
the folder structure is usually folded up . you can open a folder by double clicking on the + / - click on the + / - click , or double @-@ click on the object or by double @-@ clicking the arrow keys for left / right .
when you double @-@ click on a file , the file comparison is started and a comparison window appears .
the icon in the Name column reflects the type of file in the first folder ( A ) . these types are possible :
if the file type is different in the other folders then this is visible in the columns A / B / C and in the Details Pan@@ e to the selected object . in such a case , the merge action cannot be selected automatically . if the merge operation is started , you will be informed about problems of this type again .
as seen in the picture above , the columns A / B / C use the colors red , green , yellow and black .
with identical entries , however , the color is also identical , even if the age of the entries is different .
folders are considered to be identical if their entire content is identical . then folders have the same color . at folders , age is ir@@ relevant for its color .
the idea of this color scheme is based on dir@@ ti@@ ff . the colors reflect the colors of a leaf , which is only green , then yellow and later when it is old , red becomes .
... A and C are identical , but not B : copying B ( or if B does not exist , delete the target if it exists )
... A and B are identical , but not C : copying C ( or if C does not exist , delete the target if it exists )
... B and C are identical , but not A : copying A ( or if A does not exist , delete the target if it exists )
... A , B and C do not have the same file type ( e.g. if A is a folder and B a file ) : error : conflic@@ ting file types . as long as such faulty objects exist , merging cannot be started .
... A and B do not have the same file type ( e.g. if A is a folder and B a file ) : error : conflic@@ ting file types . as long as such faulty objects exist , merging cannot be started .
the synchronization mode is active when only two folders and no explicit target folder were specified and if the option synchron@@ ize dir@@ s . then select &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the necessary action so that afterwards both folders are identical . if for one entry ...
... A and B exist , but are not identical : merging and saving the result in both folders . ( the user sees only B as visible file name for the output file ; copied directly after merging &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; B by A. )
when two folders are merged and the Option New File instead Select ( uns@@ af@@ e ) is enabled , then examine &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the date of the files and suggests the newer file to copy . if the files are different , but the same date , an error message appears : files are different , but the date is identical .
during merging , a file is processed after the other . you status column shows your position when the merge was successful , and correspon@@ dingly other messages when something unexpected happened . if the merge is completed , you should make a final check and see if the status is all right .
when the file comparison method is selected in the setup dialog , K@@ diff@@ 3 will display more columns . these contain the number of un@@ solved , sol@@ dered , non @-@ white and white conflicts . ( the column for resolved conflicts is only displayed when three folders are compared or merged . )
you can either merge the currently selected entry ( file or odds ) , or all entries at once . if you have selected all the assembly actions ( also in all sub@@ folders ) , you can start the merge .
note : if you have not specified a destination folder , C is used as a destination in the Three @-@ folder merge mode , B is selected as the target and used as a target when synchron@@ izing A and / or B .
if you have selected a destination folder , please check that all entries should be in the target folder , also be displayed in the folder structure . there are some options that might skip certain entries . check these options to avoid unpleasant surprises :
to merge all entries , select directory merge / continue in the directory menu or press F@@ 7 ( the key short@@ cut ) to merge only the current entry : select Action from the current element or press F@@ 6 .
if the conflic@@ ting file types still exist invalid cl@@ adding actions , a message appears that indicates the faulty elements . you can then select a valid action for them .
when you merge all entries , a dialog box appears with the options Implem@@ entation , Simulation and Canc@@ el .
select Sim@@ ulate if you want to see what would happen without the real changes made . you will then receive a detailed list of all actions .
&amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; then performs certain actions with all entries . if a manual intervention is necessary ( merge a single file ) , then a merge window opens ( note the screen@@ shot ) .
when you are finished with a file , select the directory merge again , or press F@@ 7 . if you have not yet saved , a corresponding dialog appears . then , &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 will perform its work with the next entry .
at the end of the list , you will see some error messages that will help you to overcome the cause of the problem . if you continue to merge ( F@@ 7 key ) , let &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; you have the option to select another action for the entry or solve the problem in another way before proceeding with merging .
if some entries were combined individually , you notice &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; these entries ( in the current session ) do not merge again . even if the merge has been ski@@ pped or not saved , these entries will be considered completed . only if you change the merge action , these entries will be merged again .
the Settings menu of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ( Set menu Settings - &gt; K@@ diff@@ 3 ... ) now has a section called directory merge with these options :
only files that match the specified pattern are displayed in the Element@@ Tree . multiple patterns can be entered . separate the patterns with a sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ; valid plac@@ eholders : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . ( e.g. * .@@ c@@ pp ; * .@@ h ) . the default is * . folders do not have to match this pattern .
files and folders that match this pattern are not displayed in the element tree . it can be entered more than a pattern , use the sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ; as separ@@ ator . valid plac@@ eholders : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . default is * .@@ ori@@ g ; * .@@ o .
files and folders that match this pattern are not displayed in the element tree . it can be entered more than a pattern , use the sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ; as separ@@ ator . valid plac@@ eholders : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . default is * .@@ ori@@ g ; * .@@ o .
ignored files that would also be ignored by CVS . many aut@@ mati@@ cally generated files are ignored by CVS . the big advantage is that this can be configured with a .@@ c@@ v@@ sign@@ ore file . ( see info : / c@@ vs / c@@ v@@ sign@@ ore . )
in some file systems , files have a hidden attribute . in other file systems , a leading dot indicates a file as hidden . this option lets you decide whether to view these files in the element tree or not . this option is turned on in default .
links to files : if the option is turned off , symbolic links are compared . if the option is turned on , the files will be compared to which the links show . this is de@@ activated by default .
when the option is turned on , the symbolic links will be compared . if the option is turned on , the links will be treated as normal folders and recur@@ sively searched . ( note that &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; not checked for possible recur@@ sions .
performs a complete analysis of each file and displays the statistics columns . ( the number of sol@@ dered , un@@ solved , non@@ - white and white conflicts . ) Full analysis is slower than a simple binary analysis , and much slower when applied to files that contain no text . ( enter a corresponding anti @-@ pattern . )
if you compare large folders through a slow network , it may be faster to compare only the change date and file size . however , this speed advantage does not cost you a certain degree of security . please use caution . this option is turned off in default .
similar to a change date . there is no real comparison . the files are considered to be identical if they are the same size . this can be useful , for example , when copying the chan@@ gel@@ ist is lost . please use caution . this option is turned off in default .
activ@@ ates the synchronization mode when two folders are compared and no destination folder is specified . in this mode , the proposals for merging are selected in such a way that afterwards both folders are identical . also the results of merging files are stored in both folders . this option is turned off in the default setting .
if there are differences , instead of merging , copying the newer file will be suggested as an action . ( this is considered in@@ secure , as it is assumed that the other file was not changed too . you should check this in any case . ) This option is turned off in default .
if a file or folder is replaced or deleted by another , then the original version will be renamed and the extension .@@ orig@@ . If an old backup file with the .@@ ori@@ g extension is already existing , it will be deleted without further backup . this also concerns the normal merge of individual files , not just merging entire folders .
normally , the folder @-@ merge view will remain visible during the merge of individual files ; you can switch the window divi@@ der with the mouse . if you do not want , you can switch to the File menu and switch the main window in the window menu and switch between the two views by changing the directory &amp; text window .
most likely you prefer to compare a file simply by double @-@ clicking . nevertheless , there is also a corresponding menu entry in the directory menu . you can also merge a single file directly without first having to start the folder merge . to do this , you can use the current file merge from the merge menu .
this status is lost if you re @-@ read the directory : directory -@@ Menu : re @-@ read
K@@ DE supports network transparency with the help of K@@ IO slaves . K@@ diff@@ 3 uses this to read files and folders . in this way , you can specify files and folders for opening that are located on local or remote hosts .
the first command line compar@@ es a local file with one on an FTP server . the second command line compar@@ es a folder inside a compressed archive with a local folder .
a URL has a different syntax than local files and folders . a few things you should consider :
a path can be relative and@@ . or .. included . this is not possible with URLs , these are always absolute .
special characters must be escaped . ( # - &gt; % 23 , whit@@ esp@@ ace &gt; % 20 , etc . ) . for example , a file named / # fo@@ o # contains URL file : / % 23@@ fo@@ o % 23 .
sometimes due to the file system on the server , sometimes through the protocol used . it follows a short list of limitations :
or it cannot be distinguished whether a link shows a file or folder . then a file is always accepted as a link destination . ( FTP : , s@@ ft@@ p : ) .
there is no way to edit per@@ missions or modification date . therefore , the per@@ missions or the modification date will devi@@ ate from the original . ( note the option Con@@ fi@@ denti@@ ty of the size . ) ( This is only possible with local files . )
the main purpose of use is currently as a difference viewer in K@@ DE@@ V@@ EL@@ OP . K@@ DE@@ V@@ EL@@ OP first always starts the built @-@ in differences viewer . to start K@@ DE@@ V@@ EL@@ OP , press the right mouse button above the difference viewer and then select In K@@ DE@@ V@@ EL@@ OP view from the context menu .
usually you need &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; two full input files . however , if it is used as a node , &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; indicates that the input file is a patch file in unified format . then remove &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the name of the original files must exist . then start &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the patch program to restore missing file .
in Kon@@ quer@@ or you can click on a patch file and select Pre@@ view in - K@@ diff@@ 3@@ Part from the context menu . note that this does not work if none of the original files exists . besides , this is un@@ reliable when the original files have changed since the patch file has been created .
if &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; as part is executed , it only supports comparing two files , a very small toolbar and menu . the merge or matching of folders is not supported in the K@@ Part mode .
tools with the name K@@ Di@@ ff and K@@ diff@@ 2 ( now there are pairs ) there are already . furthermore , the name K@@ diff@@ 3 already indicates that it can merge as the program diff@@ 3 from the Di@@ ff tool collection .
I have been using GP@@ L programs for a long time and learned a lot when I looked into the sources of other programs . this is my thanks to all program@@ mers who have gone this path or will go that way .
you compiled the program from sources and probably didn &apos;t know the correct pre@@ fix to K@@ DE . in default , configure configure in / usr / local , but then K@@ DE can &apos;t find the resources for the user interfaces ( e.g. k@@ diff@@ 3@@ u@@ i.@@ r@@ c ) . in the RE@@ AD@@ ME file you will find more information on this topic .
if only the number of white characters differs , these lines are treated as identical ; however , if only a non @-@ white character is different , the line is treated as not identi@@ cally . i@@ F &apos;s similar lines disappear next to each other , this is the case .
the editor notices for each difference in the files where it starts and where it ends . this is necessary to solve a conflict simply by clicking in the source code and selecting the button A / B / C . however , this important information is lost if the result is simply stored as text file and it is too much effort to create extra a separate file format that could store this information .
the effort required for this was so far too large . you can always restore a certain version by selecting a source A / B / C . in order to process larger amounts of text , another editor should be used .
after removing text is suddenly lt ; No sr@@ c link ; appeared and the text cannot be deleted . what does this mean and how can it be removed ?
&amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; used already many colors to highlight differences . even more high@@ lighting would be conf@@ using and missing the purpose .
many good ideas and bug reports came from colleagues and many people from the Wild Wild Web . thank you !
to use all the functions of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 , you need &amp; k@@ de ; 3.1 or later .
information on how to use K@@ diff@@ 3 on other platforms without K@@ DE can be found on the homepage .
you can find a list of recent changes under ht@@ t@@ p : / / k@@ diff@@ 3.@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net / Ch@@ ange@@ Log or in the file Ch@@ ange@@ Log in the source package .
to compile and install on a system with &amp; k@@ de , use the command in the base folder of the &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; -@@ distribution :
K@@ DE @-@ dir returns the folder in your system where K@@ DE is installed . if you are unsure , you will find more details in the RE@@ AD@@ ME file .
since &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; auto@@ conf and autom@@ ake uses , you should have no problems comp@@ iling . if difficulties occur , please report to the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ mail@@ ing@@ lists of them .
cut out ( C@@ trl @-@ X or Shift @-@ Rem@@ ove ) copies to the clip@@ board and del@@ etes the selected text . insert ( C@@ trl @-@ V or Shift @-@ In@@ sert ) insert the text from the clip@@ board at the current cursor position or replace the current marker .
show only differences : files that are identical in all folders do not appear in the folder structure , and therefore also not in the destination folder .
( in the current program version , you need to rer@@ ead the folder with the refresh function after changes to these options . )
this also means that identical files will not be copied to the destination folder when merging . if the destination folder doesn &apos;t already contain these files , they fail to merge . ( the behavior will probably be changed in a later program version . ) This option is switched off in default .
note the buttons to select the source with the cap@@ tion A , B and C below the menu bar . if you click on one of the buttons , the rows from the appropriate window are attached to the end of the selected group in the result window ( if they are not already present ) . if the rows are already present , they will be removed by clicking on the button .
in default , this option is de@@ activated . differences in single characters ( such as &apos; A &apos; and &apos; a &apos; ) are treated as differences in white characters .
the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; shows a thumb@@ nail of all virtual des@@ kt@@ ops . it is quite convenient to see the running programs on the work@@ spaces , change their size , stop them or shift them . this works both within a desktop and several .
the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; can display all virtual des@@ kt@@ ops as well as the applications running in it . applications can be selected and even moved on the desktop and others .
with the middle mouse button , windows can be moved within the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; the movement is possible both within a working area and on other work@@ spaces .
the context menu depends on where the right mouse button is cli@@ cked : if on the empty Back@@ ground of &amp; K@@ p@@ ager , the context menu only has the two entries P@@ ager set up ... and End . if , however , the icon and the name of the application as well as the entries minimize , Maxim@@ ize , On Desktop and End .
maxim@@ izes the application window to the full size of the desktop . only appears when cli@@ cked on an application .
sends the application to the selected virtual desktop . only appears when cli@@ cked on an application .
if this check box is selected , windows can be moved within the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; s with the middle mouse button on the desktop and can also be moved to other work@@ spaces .
if this field is enabled , the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager will display the names of the virtual des@@ kt@@ ops .
tick this field allows the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager to display the numbers of virtual des@@ kt@@ ops . if it is crossed together with name , the names will be provided with folder numbers , eg ; 1 . desktop .
if this field is checked , the background of each desktop is also displayed as background in the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager .
if this field is checked , the running programs will be shown as small windows in the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager . otherwise , only empty spaces will be displayed to allow them to be selected .
here the view of the program window is selected . simply shows simple rec@@ tan@@ gles with the proportions of the program window . icon shows the windows with their standard symbol and pix@@ map shows a small view of the actual program window . note : Pix@@ map is only recommended for very fast systems .
here the arrangement of the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; main window can be determined : classic &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; in a 2x@@ N grid , as made from p@@ ager applications in some other window managers ; horizontally , all virtual des@@ kt@@ ops appear in a horizontal and vertical line , which is very good for displaying later@@ ally on the desktop .
the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; can be used as an alternative to the p@@ ager mini program in the control bar . it has the advantage that it can be altered in size , which can display and move windows as symbols or with their contents . furthermore , it runs outside the control bar .
right @-@ click inside &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; and then set up sel@@ ector switch ... allows the dialog to appear .
currently , this cannot be changed in the Settings dialog . however , you can do this manually :
open the file $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / config / k@@ pag@@ er@@ c with any text editor such as &amp; ke@@ dit ; or vi@@ . if you do not have any write permission for the file , you must login as user root or turn to your system administrator . in this file , you must enter the key wind @-@ transparent mode and assign it to this . possible values are :
since &amp; K@@ p@@ ager is part of the k@@ de@@ base package , you need a functioning installation of the basic K@@ DE basic packages .

&amp; likes ; is a screen lou@@ pe . you can use &amp; k@@ ut ; you can use a part of the screen as if you read a magni@@ fying glass for the small print or the exact viewing of a photo . this application is interesting for different users : this includes artists , web designers and people with a visual impairment . this documentation should be a complete guide to the use of &amp; k@@ mag .
&amp; K@@ mag ; is a very powerful application that is constantly extended by new features . it is optimized for use on performance @-@ sensitive machines .
when you start &amp; collapse , a window appears as shown above . the main window of &amp; k@@ mag ; shows the enlarged section of the screen . in the following , this window is called a magni@@ fying window . the image that appears in the magni@@ fication window is an enlarged section of the screen and is described in the following as selection box .
in the default setting , &amp; k@@ mag ; the area around the mouse poin@@ ter is like a mobile magni@@ fier . alternatively , you can drag &amp; drop a selected screen area in the magni@@ fying window ( select window ) or the environment of the mouse poin@@ ter at the edge of the screen ( eg , at the left edge of the screen ) .
if you want to avoid that the mouse cursor is displayed in the enlarged window , select the setting mouse poin@@ ter . please note that this is not yet able to detect the shape of the mouse poin@@ ter . this is always the default image ; / Q@@ t ; mouse cursor .
in the selection window mode , you can adjust the selection window to your own needs . you can move it with the arrow and mouse buttons and change its size . this can be done in the following way :
move the mouse poin@@ ter in the magni@@ fying window and hold the left mouse button pressed , so you can capture and move the content of the magni@@ fying window . this also goes with the arrow keys .
if you additionally press the &amp; Shift key , press the &amp; M@@ MB ; you can move the selection box .
this combination allows you to change the size of the selection window . note that the upper left corner of the selection window remains fixed and only the lower right corner is to be moved .
&amp; k@@ ills ; has a lot of features . you can send the enlarged picture directly to the printer , save to a file , copy to the clip@@ board ( to insert it later into other applications ) , rotate the image and much more .
stops or stops the ad update . stopping the update causes the needed CPU time to go to 0 .
select the update rate ( Very low , Ger@@ ing , Medium , High , High@@ ly ) . the higher the update rate , the more CPU time is needed .
in this mode , a selection window will be displayed . the selected area will be displayed in a window .
&amp; k@@ ills ; automatically uses your set short commands to store files , open a new window , print , rel@@ o@@ ads ( with the button again load in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; ) , En@@ large and reduction &amp; etc ; .
also known as &amp; k@@ magni@@ fier ; is a screen lou@@ pe . you can use &amp; k@@ magni@@ fier ; to do this use a magni@@ fier area to view the small print in a newspaper or photo . this application is useful for different people : from research or artists to web designer or visually impaired .

&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; emul@@ ates a mouse @-@ click as soon as the mouse cursor per@@ si@@ sts for a while in the same place . it is meant to help people who suffer pain at the repeti@@ tive Stra@@ in In@@ jury ( R@@ SI ) Syndrome and each mouse click causes pain .
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; can handle the pain that arises when you click the mouse and helps so many people to use the computer without pain . unfortunately , the mere moving of your computer can cause pain . if you suffer from pain associated with using your computer , you should consult a doctor if this has not yet happened .
to make it clear again : even if it helps to avoid pain caused by moving the mouse , it is useless against pain caused by moving the mouse . and as with all ergonomic aids , the result can be different for everyone .
the use of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; is simple : &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; monitors your mouse movements and results in a click of the mouse as soon as you briefly pause the motion .
when the smart shift is enabled , makes &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; a pause after pressing the mouse button . move the mouse now , wait until the end of the motion before the release of the mouse button is executed . in this way , you can drag the drag with pressed mouse button . the smart shift requires a little exercise , but you get used to it quickly .
this residence time must be c@@ logged after the end of the mouse movement before it exec@@ utes a mouse click .
if Smart Move is enabled , the shooting time ( 1 / 10 s ) is active . here the time is set , the &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; after pressing the mouse button the mouse button is wa@@ ved before moving the mouse button again , if there is no moving of the mouse in the meantime .
this function activ@@ ates a slow moving to the right and back , followed by a pause , a click with the right mouse button . a slow moving to the left and back leads a double click . these movements are started in the file $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / config / k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool _ stro@@ kes@@ .@@ txt , but will be changed later .
when the sound appears delayed , you can move , move the reaction time to shor@@ ten . open the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; , go to Sound &amp; Multimedia , select there sound system and here the tab . there is a sli@@ der sound buffer which you set to a lower value to shor@@ ten response times .
when this setting is selected , &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool is started ; at any start of &amp; k@@ de ; this function is currently only available under &amp; k@@ de ; for G@@ NO@@ ME or other window environments , please consult the respective documentation to find out how to launch a program there automatically .
reset all settings to the values set when you open the dialog . if you have already pressed the Apply button , the settings will be reset to the stand after the last pressing of the user .
best use &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool , first with pres@@ ets . in particular , you should leave the smart move off first . if you get used to the automatic mouse click , you can later remove the smart shift .
if you use the audi@@ ble click , it is necessary to reduce the response times of &amp; k@@ de ; in the case of sounds .
first you should be aware of which places a click of the mouse remains without effect : clicking on the neutral components of windows or places in the browser window that does not represent a link does not lead to unwanted reactions . you can therefore park your mouse at such places until you want to use it again .
when your mouse clicks , you should clean your mouse . this is usually pretty simple . the trick here is that you do not only clean the mouse ball , but also the roles that come into contact with the mouse ball .
first you have to take out the mouse ball . as this happens , mouse to mouse is different , but it should be clear if you look at the bottom of the mouse .
if you have removed the ball , you would have to see the rolls . these are located on the sides of the hole in which the ball was inserted . you can easily scra@@ pe the dirt and dirt with a flat blade or f@@ ing@@ ern@@ ail .
in very rare situations , the operating system interrup@@ ts execution of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; if you use the smart shift in this case , it means that &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; the operation can no longer be terminated by releasing the mouse button .
this happens when you use &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; use another window manager and move a window .
the solution for this problem is that you can run a mouse click by yourself . by doing so , the status of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool is reset , and you can continue working as usual .
problem : if you enter text , try &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; continue to execute Maus@@ kli@@ cks and place the cursor to another place .
solution : use the mouse to place the cursor to where you want it . but park your mouse on a neutral zone of the desktop when you want to make a keyboard input . thus , an accidental moving of the mouse poin@@ ter can cause unwanted reactions .
I try to work with the intelligent shift , but I don &apos;t manage to edit text .
the smart shift is an advanced function of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool , and it takes its time before you can handle it . it is very likely in this way to copy text , copy it to the clip@@ board and to insert any other action where you want to move the mouse with pressed mouse button . however , it will probably only cause problems once . here are some advice on this :
do not use the smart shift if you just start using it &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; use it as follows : drag one mouse @-@ click on the one end of the text area and hold down the Shift key while moving the mouse poin@@ ter to the other end of the text and pressing the mouse button again .
use the audi@@ ble mouse @-@ click . this time , when the mouse click is played , the mouse button expresses a sound like a mouse click . so you know exactly when the shift time starts when smart shifting . later , you can also use the smart shift without the audi@@ ble mouse click . but for that , it requires some practice .
to use &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; use the X@@ test extension for &amp; X Window ; it should be the case on most of the system .
the functionality of the audi@@ ble mouse clicks is only available when the system has a sound card and speakers , and these are correctly set up .
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; activ@@ ates the mouse button as soon as the mouse cursor per@@ si@@ sts . this program has been developed for people who suffer from R@@ SI &apos;s syndrome and who inflic@@ t pain on those of the mouse .
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; can also be configured to wait a certain time for a drag process to start before the mouse button is left . in this way you can also drag and drop using the mouse .

&amp; mouth ; is a program with which silent users can let their computer speak for themselves .
with the program &amp; ch@@ mouth , silent users can let the computer speak for themselves . the user can choose from a list with the conversation course sentences that are to be spoken again .
on the first page of the wizard ( left screen@@ shot ) , enter the command that will be used later for the voice output of text . for more details , see the description of the setup dialog .
on the second page , select the default text pas@@ sage@@ . from the text passages you can often choose used text passages without having to type them . the text passages can of course be edited .
on the third page ( right screen@@ shot ) you define the dictionary for the word translation . &amp; k@@ mouth ; reads the K@@ DE documentation of the selected language to determine the frequency of the individual words . in addition , you can compare the wor@@ d@@ lists with an Open@@ Offic@@ e.@@ org @-@ Dic@@ tionary so that only correctly sp@@ elled words can be included in the word translation .
the main window of &amp; mouth ; is clear and contains essentially an input field for the keyboard input of your sentences ( the lower white field in the screen@@ shot ) and a course memory of the already spoken sentences ( the upper white field in the screen@@ shot ) .
when you mouth , you can enter the sentences you want to hear in the input field . each spoken sentence is attached to the mouth memory . you can select sentences that should be spoken again .
with the menu entry Settings k@@ mouth ; set up ... open the settings dialog from &amp; mouth ; This dialog contains two flash@@ cards , voice output and settings , the page Wor@@ ter@@ ish@@ ement as well as the K@@ TT@@ SD language service page .
in the input field of the flash@@ card speech output , enter the command to call the language generator . in the selection field below the input field , you specify the character encoding , with the text passed on to the voice generator .
&amp; k@@ mouth ; knows two ways to pass the text . select the check box if the text is to be passed on as standard input to the language generator .
if the check box is not selected , the text will be passed on as a parameter . you can use the following wild@@ cards :
of course , the command for voice output depends on your voice generator . you will find this command in the documentation for your voice generator . examples for this can be found in the app@@ endi@@ x .
the kt@@ ts@@ d language service is a &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ da@@ emon , the &amp; k@@ de ; applications a standardized interface for voice output is provided and currently being developed in SV@@ N . the choice of this option is useful even if K@@ TT@@ SD is not installed .
the first selection field action after selecting a text passage determines which action is triggered by the short@@ cut or by the choice of a text passage in the Text passages book or in the bar for text passages .
with the selection of So@@ fort , the selected text passage is directly spoken and added in addition to the course memory . with the selection of In the input field , the selected text passage is entered at first only in the input field .
with the second drop @-@ down box of the editing window for text passages , you can specify whether the text pas@@ sage@@ book should be automatically saved when closing the editing window .
with the selection of text passages , the book will be saved . if you choose to disc@@ ard any changes , the text pas@@ ebook will not be saved .
the Wor@@ ter@@ gÃ¤n@@ ger page contains a list of dic@@ tion@@ aries for the cat@@ ter@@ ment . in the main window next to the entry field shows &amp; ch@@ mouth ; a select field if this list contains more than one dictionary .
with the buttons on the right of the page you can delete or add dic@@ tion@@ aries , change the order of the books or export them to a file . below the list , you can set the name and the language for the dictionary in the input field .
select the desired language for this source ; &amp; k@@ mouth ; then read the &amp; k@@ de ; documentation . the frequency of the individual words is easily retri@@ eved by counting the occurrence . in addition , you can compare the wor@@ d@@ list with an Open@@ Offic@@ e.@@ org dictionary to insert only properly written words into the new dictionary .
with this option you can merge the available dic@@ tion@@ aries . &amp; k@@ mouth ; then ask which dic@@ tion@@ aries are summari@@ zed and how they should be weigh@@ ted .
this option lets you create a new , empty dictionary without entries . da &amp; k@@ mouth ; newly entered words automatically insert into the dictionary , create a dictionary with your vocabulary over time .
the main area of the window to edit text passages is split . in the upper part , the text passages are represented as a tree structure .
in the lower part you can edit a selected entry . if you have selected a text passage , you can change the text passage or the associated keyboard short@@ cut . if you have selected a text passage , you can only change its name .
you can either add actions such as new text passages or books , or delete selected text passages and books , either through the selection in the menu bar , in the toolbar or via a drop @-@ down menu .
the sequence of text passages or text passages can be changed by dra@@ gging the mouse to the new position or using the arrow keys and the &amp; alt ; button .
the selected text is cut out and copied to the clip@@ board . if a text section is selected in the input field , it is used , otherwise the selected areas of the default storage .
the selected text is copied to the clip@@ board . if a text section is selected in the input field , it is used , otherwise the selected areas of the default storage .
the currently active sentence is spoken . if text is in the input field , it is used otherwise the selected sentences are used .
if this menu entry is checked , a sliding tool bar with buttons for frequently used commands is displayed . by default , the toolbar is placed above the editing pane directly under the menu bar . by clicking on the hat@@ ched left side and pulling the toolbar can be moved to another location .
if this menu entry is checked , a narrow bar is displayed in the lower part of the main window with hints about the state of &amp; mouth ; if not checked , this status bar is hidden .
if this menu entry is checked , a sli@@ dable bar for text passages is displayed with entries . by default , the bar is placed above the editing pane directly below the toolbar . by clicking on the hat@@ ched left side and pulling the toolbar can be moved to another location .
probably you have not entered the command for the speech output correctly or not fully . open Settings k@@ mouth ; set up ... , open the General Settings page and enter the command for the speech output on the flash@@ card speech output . ( see the settings dialog for voice syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers for further details . )
the festival is a language edition system from the University of Edinburgh . currently , only English , Spanish and Wal@@ is@@ isch are supported . the license allows to use the festival for free and to spread it without restrictions .
to display an example of the command line for setting the voice output , it is assumed that the festival is installed in the / usr / local / festival folder .
Free@@ T@@ TS is a written voice generator . currently it only supports English pron@@ unciation . the license allows you to use Free@@ T@@ TS for free and to spread it without restrictions .
to display an example of the command line for setting up the voice output , it is assumed that Free@@ T@@ TS is installed in the / usr / local / fre@@ eware directory . the voice output is then possible with one of the three following command examples :
for the third example , the option must be turned on as default input . ( this is the recommended example of using Free@@ T@@ TS . )
MB@@ RO@@ LA is a voice generator for many languages . it converts a list of phon@@ em@@ es into a wave file , so you need an additional program to rip the text into phon@@ em@@ es . the license allows you to use MB@@ RO@@ LA for free for non @-@ commercial and non @-@ military applications .
in our example , H@@ adi@@ fax is used to convert the German text into phon@@ em@@ es for MB@@ RO@@ LA , assuming that H@@ adi@@ fax and MB@@ RO@@ LA are installed in / usr / local / hadi@@ fax and / usr / local / MB@@ RO@@ LA .
unfortunately H@@ adi@@ fax likes to swal@@ low the last character of the text , so that an additional character has to be added . therefore , the full command is more complex than in the other examples :
( CAT - ; echo quot ; &amp; quot ; ) _ BA@@ R _ / usr / local / imm@@ fax / t@@ x@@ t@@ 2@@ ph@@ o -@@ e / usr / local / MB@@ RO@@ LA / de@@ 1 / tmp / t@@ mp@@ .@@ wa@@ v ; r@@ m / tmp / t@@ mp@@ .@@ wa@@ v
all parts of the command must be written in a line . the option to send data as standard input must be enabled .
the voice output da@@ emon from &amp; k@@ de ; ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) is an &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ further language service that provides all &amp; k@@ de ; applications a standard interface for voice output . K@@ TT@@ SD is currently being developed in SV@@ N . it uses modules to support different voice output systems .
since the setting of the language generator only takes place in the K@@ TT@@ SD , you only have to use kt@@ ts@@ d as a language service in &amp; k@@ mouth ; set .
for setting , use the K@@ TT@@ SD language service page , which appears in the Settings dialog of &amp; K@@ mouth ; appears when K@@ TT@@ SD is installed .
at &amp; k@@ mouth ; to use successfully , you need a voice generator ( and of course &amp; k@@ de ; 3.@@ x ) . &amp; k@@ mouth ; requires about 15 MB of memory ( and additionally memory for the voice generator ) , but this depends on your computer and configuration .
&amp; mouth ; is an application , with people who cannot speak , can output text by the computer . it is stored in a list of pre @-@ spoken sentences , which the user can repeatedly spend .
note that &amp; ch@@ mouth ; no language syn@@ thesizer contains . a voice syn@@ thesizer must be installed on the computer .

before you can use it , you need to install and set the speech @-@ speech @-@ dis@@ pat@@ cher . see also
on the first launch of kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr or as long as no speakers are set up , the card card is displayed . see also . if you have set up at least one speaker , the tab is displayed in General . see .
most T@@ TS syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers offer different languages and voices , so also different male or female , or those that differ in volume or speed . you can also set up multiple versions for a syn@@ thesizer . you should at least set up a speaker before you use &amp; kt@@ ts ; otherwise the program will use high @-@ speed dispens@@ ers to the standard speaker .
several speakers for the same syn@@ thesizer are comparable to several printer sp@@ lines for the same printer .
if you click on the tab Spe@@ aker in kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr , the cardboard card is displayed . it also appears automatically when you start kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr and not yet a speaker is set up .
all already established speakers appear in this list . the preferred speakers appear in the list above . the top spokes@@ man is used for speech output when an application does not present a speaker .
with a click of a mouse , select a speaker from the list , and click this button to remove the speaker from the list .
with a click of a mouse , select a speaker from the list , and click this button to change the settings . see below .
with a click of a mouse , select a speaker from the list , and click on this button to push the speaker in the list one line further down . the order of the speakers in the list also determines their priority .
click on one of these buttons to apply your changes to the current &amp; kt@@ ts ; system .
choose a voice type here , there are three male and three female voices as well as a boys and female voice to choose from .
if you click here , the new speaker will appear on the card card spokes@@ man . to change the settings of this speaker , click Edit .
now you can &amp; kt@@ ts ; already almost use . go back to the index card and check whether voice output is enabled ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) to start reading text . see . now you can &amp; kt@@ ts ; use to read text . click on the cardboard card orders to create and manage text jobs . see .
if you have created at least one speaker , you can start the &amp; k@@ de language output system . click on the General tab to open this tab . here you can set some general options .
select this check box to activate the &amp; kt@@ ops ; this starts the K@@ DE T@@ TS service ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) . if this start is successful , the card card orders are displayed , and you can create and read text jobs . see . remove the mark , get K@@ TT@@ SD and disable the T@@ TS system from &amp; k@@ de ; disabled .
if kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr is finished , it will run &amp; kt@@ ts ; further , if the field is enabled ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) .
if this check box is selected and kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr appears automatically in the system area of the control bar , it disappears again as soon as the preview is complete .
with buttons in this series , you can start , cancel , pause and resume text jobs .
with buttons in this series you can read the current text in the &amp; k@@ de ; clip@@ board or open a text file to read . you can also switch the speaker for an order .
click Apply or OK , then all changed settings will be taken over on all pages .
the card card orders are only displayed when K@@ TT@@ SD is started . to start K@@ TT@@ SD , click the General tab and tick the language output ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) .
in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; , the web browser of &amp; k@@ de ; , you can read the text of the displayed website . check first , if &amp; kt@@ ts ; runs . then check the text that should be read before , and select Tools Text in the main menu .
it is almost always useful to mark the desired text of a web page . you can also skip this step , but then many &amp; HTML ; -@@ he@@ aders and other invisible brands are also read .
in &amp; k@@ ate ; the advanced text editor of &amp; k@@ de ; , you can read the text displayed . first , check if &amp; t@@ ts ; runs . then select the text that should be read before and select Tools Text in the Main Menu . then the language output should begin .
this also works if &amp; k@@ ate ; embedded in other applications , such as &amp; eg ; in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; or in &amp; Qu@@ anta ; .
K@@ not@@ fy is the news system of &amp; k@@ de ; you will be notified of the events you set . you can also read the text of these messages from &amp; kt@@ ts .
in &amp; conversation ; , the IR@@ C program of &amp; k@@ de ; you can set up various types of messages ; for example , set up that you are notified when a message appears in an IR@@ C channel in which your nick@@ name occurs . with &amp; kt@@ ts ; you can then read the IR@@ C message text .
supports an &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ program K@@ not@@ fy , a menu entry appears in the Settings menu settings of this program . the possible settings for K@@ not@@ fy are different depending on the application .
the file k@@ mail@@ .x@@ ml , which is included in the scope of delivery of &amp; kt@@ ts , is a good example . it removes the tags b@@ r and b from the messages sent by K@@ Mail , and also the expression / local / in@@ box , since it can be assumed in most cases as provided .
filters are one of the advanced capabilities of &amp; kt@@ ts ; for normal work with &amp; kt@@ ts ; filters are not required .
text is processed in filters before it is sent to speech @-@ dis@@ pat@@ cher . it is useful for improving pron@@ unciation , to replace spoken words or abbrevi@@ ations , select a suitable language and speaker or to avoid certain short@@ com@@ ings of speech syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers and their voices .
in order to understand the functioning of filters , it is important to know how the speech @-@ dis@@ pat@@ cher program works with a text . &amp; kt@@ ts ; distinguishes four types of texts .
the output of screen readers has the highest priority . it is preferred to all other orders and stops these orders . if the output of the screen reader is read , the retained orders will be resum@@ ed .
warnings have the next priority . this level is important messages like &amp; eg ; processor is reserved too hot . a warning has priority and keeps the output of messages and normal text . these orders are resum@@ ed following the output of the warning .
messages have the highest priority . a message interrup@@ ts normal text . &amp; k@@ mouth ; is an example of an application that uses messages . while you can read a long text on a web page , you can talk to &amp; k@@ mouth ; someone who just enters the room .
the rest are simple text orders . each order you receive from the card card is a text order . K@@ S@@ ay@@ it is an example of an application that uses text orders . text orders are intended for the output of longer texts that do not have any special ur@@ gency .
all four types of orders are processed in queue , with the exception of the output of Screen Re@@ aders . if an application sends the output of a screen reader , while &amp; kt@@ ts ; just one such reads , this output is stopped and finished .
first , you need to know that filters will never be applied to the output of Screen Re@@ aders . they are applied to normal al@@ erts , messages and text orders as well as on &amp; k@@ de ; messages .
filter the text and pass it on to the next filter . currently , there are three types of filters .
filters are designed as modules . in the future there can be even more types of filters .
strings replace parts of a text by other text . the parts to be replaced can either be delivered as words or as regular expressions .
&amp; XML ; conver@@ ters use an X@@ SL@@ T file ( XML ; Style Language - Trans@@ forms ) to convert &amp; XML ; from one format to another format . included &amp; kt@@ ts ; are some X@@ SL@@ T files to translate &amp; X@@ HTML ; included in SS@@ ML .
with subscri@@ ber selection filters you can send orders depending on the content of the text or depending on the program that has sent the text to &amp; kt@@ ts . for example , if you have set a female voice on the card card speaker , you can read text from K@@ DE messages about it . read more .
each of these filters has adjustable rules , after which it is applied to a speech output . if the filter detects that its rules do not apply , the text continues to pass the text to the next filter .
when a text order , a message , warning or a &amp; k@@ de ; notification is sent to &amp; kt@@ ts ; sent , it is processed by all activated filters that have been set up on the bottom . processing by the filters takes place in the order in the list from top to bottom .
this shows the list of established normal filters . if a filter is not checked , it is not activated and is not used . filters are executed from top to bottom .
click here to insert a new filter . select the type of filter and the following setup di@@ alogs are displayed .
for the set @-@ up filters you have to enter a list of words or regular expressions as comparison samples . if these patterns are found in the text , then the text will be replaced with the corresponding substitute text .
enter a name for your filter . you can choose this name arbitr@@ arily , it only has to differ from the names of the other filters .
this is the list of words and regular expressions . the filter compar@@ es the text with the strings in the column and replaces it in accordance with the string from the column Re@@ place . the list is processed in the displayed order from top to bottom .
click here to move the selected word or regular expression in the list .
with these buttons you can load a list of words or regular expressions from a file , save or delete the current list . load a list of a file , the entries will be app@@ ended from the file to the existing list .
if a language is entered here , the filter will only be used if the speaker speaks for the text order one of the languages listed here . click the button to view a list of languages . you can also select multiple languages if you press the &amp; C@@ trl ; key pressed while clicking .
if a value is entered here , the filter will only be used if the text is from one of the specified applications . you can enter multiple programs separated by comm@@ a . example : conversation , k@@ mail
the application ID of running programs can be obtained with the program q@@ d@@ bus ; the &amp; d@@ bus ; -@@ Num@@ bers must be om@@ itted . if for example , the Application ID Cop@@ ete @-@ 34@@ 32 indicates , you may only enter a copy .
the string asser@@ tion filter will only be applied to the text when all conditions apply with an entry in the box . if all input fields are empty , the filter will be applied to all texts .
when comparing words , the string asser@@ tion filter uses regular expressions in the form \ \ s word \ \ . thus , the words must be limited to both sides by del@@ im@@ iters ( spaces ) .
in this manual you will find no instructions for writing regular expressions . if you have installed the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ Editor &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; Reg@@ ular &amp; # 160 ; terms &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; Reg@@ ular &amp; # 160 ; Ex@@ pres@@ sions can be found in the package .
XML ; - Trans@@ former translate &amp; XML ; with the help of X@@ SL@@ T files from a format to another format . X@@ SL@@ T ( XML ; Style Language - Trans@@ forms ) is a W@@ 3@@ C standard for such conver@@ sions . it can only be applied to well @-@ formed XML . the x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c utility must be installed on your system .
enter the path for the x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c program . if x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c is accessible via the environment variable PAT@@ H , x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c is sufficient .
with the subscri@@ ber selection filter , you can send text to a particular speaker , which is set up on the card card speaker , or to a speaker with specific features . for example , you can specify that texts from k@@ mail should be read by a female voice . see .
before &amp; kt@@ ts ; a text is handed over to the filter , it looks for a speaker for the text . the speaker is selected based on the speaker properties which the program exec@@ utes , which sends the text to &amp; kt@@ ts ; the speaker is selected using the speaker output filter and you can over@@ ride the selected speaker .
if a value is entered here , the filter will apply if the text contains the regular expression . is on your system the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ Editor &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; Reg@@ ular &amp; # 160 ; expressions installed , you can call it by clicking on the button to get help in entering .
in order to achieve faster processing , you should try to anchor the regular expression at the beginning of the string , i.e. , start the regular expression with &lt; ! &#91; C@@ DATA &#91; ^ &#93; &#93; &gt; .
specify the properties of the speaker you want . if the text fills the filter conditions shown above , the speaker is selected to meet the desired requirements . click on the button on the right to view the language selection dialog .
use these buttons to save or load your language settings or delete all settings .
the subscri@@ ber selection filter will only be applied to the text if all conditions apply with an entry in the box Sli@@ ze Filter if applicable . you must enter at least one condition .
the voice output API , of &amp; k@@ de ; , which program@@ mers can give their applications T@@ TS abilities . applications communicate with K@@ TT@@ SD via &amp; d@@ bus ; .
the K@@ TT@@ SD module API , which can be added to the K@@ TT@@ SD language syn@@ thesizer , so that &amp; kt@@ ts ; this syn@@ thesizer can use .
the following section contains a short description of the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ D@@ Bus ; interface of the language output API of &amp; k@@ de ; the complete documentation for both AP@@ Is can be found on the k@@ de ; Acces@@ sibility website ( ht@@ t@@ p : / / acces@@ si@@ bil@@ ity@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org ) .
applications request voice output via the &amp; d@@ bus ; -@@ interface of &amp; k@@ de ; from the program kt@@ ts@@ d to the object K@@ Spe@@ ech .
text of text to read and option is a language code like &amp; eg ; en , de &amp; etc ;
there are even more commands that you can use . for a list of all commands , type
open two &amp; console ; window . first , start kt@@ ts@@ d in a window , then kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr in the other .
none of the mentioned voice syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers supports my language . where can I get a syn@@ thesizer for my language ?
I have set the &amp; HTML ; -@@ XML ; form@@ er@@ filter , but when using the module for the festival websites are not read .
due to an error in Festival 1.@@ 95 beta you have to install the ( male British ) voice ra@@ b _ di@@ phone for S@@ able to work at all . you have to do this yourself if you do not use this voice to read web pages . also make sure the program x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c is installed and can be found via the environment variable PAT@@ H .
certain characters or punc@@ tu@@ ation marks appear to cause errors in the syn@@ thesizer , so that whole sentences are ski@@ pped or only gi@@ b@@ ber@@ ish is output . what can I do about it ?
first , make sure that the character encoding option is set to the correct value for the respective language . if there are problems with certain characters or words , these may be fixed by a string release filter . see .

the voice syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers used by &amp; kt@@ ts have their own license , which you will find in the respective documentation or on the respective websites . there are also voices that have their own license .
if you have access to the K@@ DE source code archive , you can download the package in kt@@ ts@@ d . also , you can find the source code from k@@ de@@ Fon@@ t@@ ft@@ p : / / ft@@ p.@@ k@@ de@@ .org / pub / k@@ de / .
it contains many languages , a list of all currently supported languages can be found on the project page ht@@ t@@ p : / / es@@ pe@@ ak@@ .@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net / langu@@ ag@@ es.@@ html .
American English , British , Spanish , German , Finnish , Czech , Polish , Russian , Italian , French , Canadian French , Kis@@ w@@ ah@@ il@@ i , Zul@@ u and Ibi@@ bio .
K@@ T@@ TS also works with any language syn@@ thesizer , which can be started on the command line in a console .
the list of the above languages can be incomplete or out@@ dated . therefore , consult the description of the syn@@ thesizer to the supported languages . check also on the kt@@ ts website ; for information not yet included in this manual .
the speech @-@ dis@@ pat@@ cher program uses an adap@@ table module architecture for voice syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers . if you would like to extend the use of another syn@@ thesizer , contact the developer team .
the program x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c is used for the support of SS@@ ML and for the &amp; XML ; -@@ conversion filter , but is not mandatory . Deb@@ ian users can install x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c with the command apt @-@ get install x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c .
to compile and compile , you need a current development environment of K@@ DE ( version 3.4 or newer ) including the c@@ deli@@ bs package and the development files for the speech &quot; speech pat@@ cher . &quot;
if you have the source code from &amp; kt@@ ts ; from the source code archive for disable or download the tar@@ ball created every night , compile and install the program with the following commands :
before you use &amp; kt@@ ts , check first if speech @-@ Dis@@ pat@@ cher works correctly with your voice syn@@ thesizer . to do so , you can use the shell script sp@@ d @-@ conf .
&amp; kt@@ ts ; in &amp; k@@ de ; 4.4 is the first version of kt@@ ts ; the program kt@@ t@@ ms@@ gr is to be developed so that the creation of speech discs is directly possible and the script sp@@ h @-@ conf is no longer needed .
a long text is dis@@ assembled into individual sentences . the user can leave the set or paragraph style , repeat the output , pause or cancel the output .
if an application puts text on &amp; kt@@ ts , you can specify the properties of the preferred speaker for the output . if you have set up a speaker , whose language is English and its gender is female , it is used , otherwise the best matching speaker is chosen automatically . if you want to learn more about it , how &amp; t@@ ts ; a speaker chooses , look at .
when you click Add a spokes@@ man on the Add @-@ on tab or click Edit , the box is displayed in the list of speakers . for example , the setup of the module for Festival Interactive will be shown below . for details on the modules , see below .
enter the path to the exec@@ utable festival program . if the path to festival is included in PAT@@ H , you only need to enter festival .
select the character encoding for text that will be passed to Festival . if there are voices that &amp; kt@@ ts ; known , this setting is automatically done . generally , Western languages use ISO 88@@ 59 @-@ 1 , Eastern languages such as Czech or Slovak use ISO 88@@ 59 @-@ 2 .
with these sli@@ ders , you adjust volume , speech speed and pitch of the synthetic language . if you cannot select some controls and display this grey , the voice you choose will not allow these settings .
some voices like Multi@@ Sy@@ n voices need to be loaded several seconds due to their size . if you select this check box , these voices are already loaded at the start of K@@ TT@@ SD so that the first set will be syn@@ thes@@ ized faster ( with larger memory consumption ) .
if this check box cannot be selected , you have not yet set up a speaker ( or click Apply ) . see .
if this check box is selected , the kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr program window will be displayed when starting with kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr . otherwise , after the start , only the kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr icon in the system section is visible , but not the program window . click on the icon in the system section to view the program window .
if this check box is selected and kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr is not running yet , it will appear in the system area as soon as K@@ TT@@ SD reads a text . this allows you to pause or otherwise control the preview .
here are all orders placed in the queue , along with the application that set the order , the current status of the order , the number of sets and the precisely processed set . the Spe@@ aker @-@ ID corresponds to the ID column on the card card spokes@@ man .
with the buttons in this row , you can move forward or backward in the order placed in the list below . ( but not every order consists of several sets ) .
with a click on OK , all changes to the settings ( also on the other card cards ) will be taken over and kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr is reduced to the symbol in the system section . then click on this icon to view the program window again .
if the sound system &amp; arts ; not installed , but instead AL@@ SA , G@@ Stre@@ amer or a@@ Ko@@ de , click on the map audio . see also .
here , only text orders are listed and managed . output of screen re@@ a@@ ers , warnings and messages are not displayed . for more information about the message types from &amp; kt@@ ts , see in .
select the type of audio output here . if a component cannot be selected , &amp; kt@@ ts ; either compiled without support for the appropriate audio module , or &amp; kt@@ ts ; does not load the necessary libraries .
if you want to use G@@ Stre@@ amer or a@@ Ko@@ de for audio output , select the audio output here . if no output modules are displayed in the list , you must install at least one module . if you have selected AL@@ SA , select the PC@@ M device here .
set the rate of speech here . 50 free ; % corresponds to half and 200 ; % approximately the double normal speaking speed . so that these settings can be implemented , the program so@@ x needs to be installed .
click Apply to take over the new settings for the current &amp; kt@@ ts ; system .
the list of AL@@ SA devices includes all PC@@ M devices and modules that are set up in your system . most of them will not work . you have to find out which device works with you . in doubt , select Def@@ ault .
on this card card you can set up special actions that are always executed when the text order is interrupted by a higher priority message .
the output of screen readers has the highest priority . it is preferred to all other orders and stops these orders . once the output of the screen reader is read , the retained orders are resum@@ ed .
warnings have the highest priority . this level is important news such as &amp; eg ; processor is reserved too hot . a warning keeps the output of messages and normal text . these orders are resum@@ ed following the warning of the warning .
messages have the next priority . a message interrup@@ ts normal text . &amp; k@@ mouth ; is an example of an application that speaks messages . if you &amp; eg ; just read a long text on a web page , you can come with &amp; mouth ; still welcome someone who is entering the room .
a text order is interrupted by a message , warning or output of a screen reader , adds &amp; kt@@ ts ; the audio output into the queue .
this audio file is played when a normal text order is interrupted . if both introduc@@ tory sound and introduc@@ tory messages are active , the introduc@@ tory sound is played before the introduc@@ tory message .
the settings on this card are only valid for normal text orders . there are no special actions for messages , warnings and the output of screen readers if they are interrupted by a higher priority message .
to read with &amp; kt@@ ts ; read K@@ not@@ fy messages , run kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr and click noti@@ fications . the flash@@ card notification appears .
select this check box to turn on &amp; recover the noti@@ fications . if this setting is not selected , the remaining settings are disabled and kt@@ ts ; do not read al@@ erts .
if this setting is selected , noti@@ fications in which a sound is played are not read by &amp; kt@@ ts .
use these buttons to add or delete events to the list . when you click the Add button , a dialog appears where you can select the application and event you want to add to the list .
this event reads the message before , the conversation ; sent when someone in an IR@@ C message men@@ tions your nick@@ name .
all events for which nothing else is specified in the list are ignored by &amp; kt@@ ts ; ignored .
use this sel@@ ector to specify what &amp; kt@@ ts ; do when an event arrives . you have the following choices :
if you have selected user @-@ defined text , enter the desired text . you can use the following wild@@ cards :
you can enter here the properties of the desired speaker . standard sel@@ ects the speaker , which is shown in the list on the card card spokes@@ man as the upper entry .
note that there are three levels for events . if an action is specified for a certain event of a particular application , it will be executed . otherwise , the action will be executed for all other events of the particular application .
the Event All noti@@ fications for application default ( all other events cannot be deleted from the list . for this purpose , you can set the default notification as follows :
use the Save button to save the settings for the noti@@ fications to a file . the loaded events will be merged with the events on the list . if you want to start with an empty list , click Del@@ ete . all entries except all noti@@ fications will be deleted .
the Spe@@ ech Syn@@ thesis Mark@@ up Language ( SS@@ ML ) is a W@@ 3@@ C standard to highlight text for voice output . this standard contains marks for controlling voices , speaking speed , volume , sex of voice and pitch .
currently supported &amp; kt@@ ts ; SS@@ ML only partly and only in basic functions . the following restrictions are available :
you need to install the ra@@ b _ di@@ phone voice ( British male ) since this is the default voice that uses the festival in the output of SS@@ ML .
if the settings for speed or pitch in the festival configuration dialog are not set to 100 , SS@@ ML text is usually spoken very mon@@ oton@@ ously .

there are two types of filters - normal filters and set @-@ level detection filters ( SD@@ B filters ) . this allows &amp; kt@@ ts to start faster with reading , since only the first set has to be syn@@ thes@@ ized , not the entire text order .
here you can see the pro@@ posi@@ tional filter . at the first launch of &amp; kt@@ ts , a set of pro@@ posi@@ tional filters is set up automatically . you can change its settings or add more pro@@ posi@@ tional filters , but beginners will be advised of this .
the easiest way to learn is to set up the language selection by going out . switch off the language selection and enter text to read . check on the box menu assignments , which spokes@@ man &amp; kt@@ ops ; choose . turn on the speaker selection again , change some features and check how to set up the speaker &apos;s selection , otherwise the filter is in@@ effective .
&amp; kt@@ ts ; then you can start reading faster , because only the first set needs to be processed and not the whole text block , which can take a very long time ,
you can then pause or cancel text orders on the card card , even if the voice syn@@ thesizer does not support this function .
for these reasons , the normal set @-@ level recognition filter is set up automatically when you start kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr for the first time . it cannot be switched off , only removed . do not change anything in this filter unless you know what you are doing .
punc@@ tu@@ ation Reco@@ gni@@ tion Fil@@ ters compare text with a regular expression for pro@@ posi@@ tional phrases and add a tab@@ ulation mark ( decim@@ al code 8 ) to the pro@@ posi@@ tional boundaries ( tab characters are automatically removed from the text before filtering ) . note that the standard pro@@ posi@@ tional filter retains the character set .
S@@ BD filters are never applied to &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ Mess@@ ages , warnings , messages or the output of screen readers .
if you have removed the normal pro@@ posi@@ tional filter , you can paste it again by loading the standard _ s@@ b@@ dr@@ c file contained in &amp; kt@@ ts .
on the card card box selection , you can over@@ ride the subscri@@ ber settings for the application .
use of the standard speaker ( the top on the card card speaker ) . in other words : no tal@@ k@@ ative properties are specified .
use of the most appropriate speaker that displays all the features of a set @-@ up speaker . if you do not delete or edit the settings of the speaker , choose &amp; kt@@ ts ; otherwise select &amp; kt@@ ts ; otherwise select &amp; kt@@ ts ; the speaker that best meets the originally set properties .
select the method to enter the desired speech properties by clicking on one of the selection buttons .
select the properties of the desired speaker here . if this feature doesn &apos;t matter , don &apos;t enter anything .
mark this check box if the property is to take preced@@ ence over other properties . you can also set several markers here .
since the language is a critical factor in publishing the output , it is always used as a priority feature . you will rarely use this feature . the only case where you might want to specify the attribute language is before you know that a particular application will send text in another language than the one in the working environment .
to use all the features in the speaker , most likely to delete the following , click on the standard speaker icon and then use the speaker , which is closest to the following .
in this case 0 is for the last text order in the queue . you can also specify a order number . ( no order number is required 0 ) .
kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr stops immediately when it is started . I compiled Deb@@ ug support , but I don &apos;t get back tracking .
G@@ Stre@@ amer 0.@@ 8.@@ x is finished . you probably need to register G@@ Stre@@ amer . if the problem is not resolved by this , a non @-@ compatible version of G@@ Stre@@ amer is installed . you can try to update or uninstall G@@ Stre@@ amer .
the audio output over AL@@ SA does not work if I play music simultaneously with another application . if I receive a text order , Fri@@ ert &amp; kt@@ ts ; a . on the &amp; Con@@ sole ; appears a message stating : Un@@ able to open PC@@ M .
on your system , the problem is that there are conflicts with AL@@ SA , which prevent the simultaneous opening of multiple PC@@ M devices . please refer to the AL@@ SA project ( d@@ mix ) on the website of the AL@@ SA project ( d@@ mix ) at www.@@ al@@ sa @-@ proj@@ ect@@ .org .
I uploaded an additional voice for festival from the Internet . I installed it and can use it in festival , but kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr does not show this voice .
add the new voice in the $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / apps / kt@@ ts@@ d / fes@@ tival@@ int / resume file . if that is successful , please send a patch along with the &amp; URL ; where you found the voice to the developers .
the program so@@ x must be installed and can be retri@@ eved via the PAT@@ H environment variable . some syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers such as Festival Interactive even offer a setting for speed on the card card for subscri@@ ber setup . depending on the selected voice , it is active or in@@ active .
the settings for the speech speed are ignored when &amp; kt@@ ts ; &amp; HTML ; read . ( this is because the HTML is converted into SS@@ ML . ) De@@ activate either the filter for the conversion of &amp; HTML ; ( see ) or , if you are quite bold , change the .x@@ s@@ l file of the &amp; HTML ; -@@ after @-@ SS@@ ML en@@ form@@ er@@ filter , and set up the speech speed .
I don &apos;t manage to read websites with a female voice . I have created a female festival speaker , but &amp; kt@@ ts ; reads the web pages with a male voice .
at Festival 1.@@ 95 beta , the day S@@ able GEN@@ DER does not seem to work . so that the festival does not produce any errors , the x@@ s@@ l file re@@ jects the GEN@@ DER @-@ Tags for converting SS@@ ML to S@@ aber . same also applies to the VO@@ ICE tags .
I have added an own string of asser@@ tion filter and now I can go back or forth in &amp; kt@@ ts ; no longer set @-@ up or go back . on the tab order is displayed , the order consists only of one sentence . what am I doing wrong ?
punc@@ tu@@ ation marks ( dot , question mark , ex@@ clamation mark , comm@@ a and sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ) are not allowed to filter out . instead , use a filter for pro@@ posi@@ tional character recognition .

some users experience in connection with AL@@ SA conflicts in audio output . if your system also counts , you cannot play music at the same time and read a text . &amp; kt@@ ts ; also freezes when you stop a text order and then start another . you can find possible solutions for this problem on the AL@@ SA ( d@@ mix ) website .
as of July 2005 , a@@ Ko@@ de does not support real breaks . if you hold a text order in &amp; kt@@ ts , the current sentence is still read .
the so@@ x audio program is used for the general setting of speech speed , but is otherwise not mandatory . Deb@@ ian users can install so@@ x with the command apt @-@ get install so@@ x . the program is included on most &amp; Linux ; -@@ CDs already .

before you use &amp; kt@@ ts , check first if your voice syn@@ thesizer works properly . follow the instructions you have received with the syn@@ thesizer .
Festival is one of the best free T@@ TS syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers , whose source code is open . the quality of the voices is generally good , and multiple voices and languages are supported .
you need to install at least one language . you will find help in the instructions supplied with the festival . if you want to read web pages , you need to install the ( male British ) voice ra@@ b _ di@@ phone .
for these voices you need to compile an additional module , so you need the source code of the festival . the German voices are subject to restrictions during the transfer .
the voice is still in an early stage of development . the voice is still in an early stage of development . un@@ pack the software in festival / li@@ b / Vo@@ ices / r@@ ussi@@ an / . if you set up the Russian voices , you must enter for the voices MS@@ U _ ru _ NS@@ H _ di@@ phone . select a Cy@@ ri@@ l@@ lic ( 8 @-@ bit ) encoding , such as co@@ i@@ 8 @-@ R .
Festival is usually included in the &amp; Linux distri@@ butions . therefore , check out the festival as the first on the CDs of your distribution .
if you want to use Polish , Hungarian or Czech languages , the encoding option must be set to ISO 88@@ 59 @-@ 2 .
if you want to use the Russian voice , the encoding option must be set to 8 @-@ bit Cy@@ ri@@ l@@ lic such as co@@ i@@ 8 @-@ R .
Festival can be used together with the &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; syn@@ thesizer . then Festival takes over the lex@@ ical analysis and &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; generates the audio output from it . the &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; program and the &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; voices can be downloaded from
note that &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; no complete language output system is . &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; generates language from di@@ phone files . you need additional software to create this di@@ phone . Festival generates these from &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; required di@@ phon@@ e. t@@ x@@ t@@ 2@@ ph@@ o can also create di@@ phones from German lyrics . more information can be found here .
in this process , additional wra@@ pper code will be added to the Festival to use &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; -@@ Vo@@ ices for voice synthesis . note that the &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; -@@ voice files are not installed in the &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; folder , but in the folder festival / li@@ b / . instructions can be found at
I@@ MS German Festival is a modified version of Festival for German &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; -@@ Vo@@ ices . required is either Festival Version 1.@@ 4.1 or Festival 2.0 ( 1.@@ 95@@ beta ) . first install Festival and &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; then download MS German Festival from
instructions can be found in the RE@@ AD@@ ME file in the package you have downloaded . ( for use with Festival 2.0 you do not need to re@@ compile the error correction , you just need to re@@ compile the festival ) . then add the following lines to the file festival / li@@ b / sit@@ em@@ it@@ .@@ sc@@ m .

this manual explains the installation and use of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; , a module for the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center , which allows management of network interfaces , routing and DNS settings .
the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; allows the user to manage a set of system and desktop settings via a unified , integrated surface . the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; can be accessed by selecting K Menu k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ;
the &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; package was developed to allow users to manage the TCP / IP network settings in the same way as other settings from the &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; create a simple interface for the user for the following tasks :
after the installation , a new module network settings are displayed in the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; the module network settings ( k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; ) can be started by selecting k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; Internet &amp; Network network settings in &amp; K@@ Menu ;
it is important to understand that &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; network hardware cannot be installed . physical devices and their drivers must already be installed and configured , so that &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; the device generally displays and allows setting of network features .
in most cases , drivers for network hardware and other devices are installed and installed . if network devices are added later , the drivers need to be loaded by adapting the following files according to the kernel version :
the Network Set@@ ting module is loaded when the option to select network settings in the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; index . when starting module network settings , this will automatically detect the platform used on the system .
if the platform cannot be detected , the manual selection is offered . it is the platform to choose from the list that best matches the distribution and release point . by selecting the setting non @-@ again questions , the definition can be made permanently .
changing the network settings is only possible in system management mode . previously , all options are displayed gray , meaning the settings can only be viewed , changing is not possible . in the system administration mode , you enter system management mode at the bottom of the module by clicking the button . it is necessary to enter the password .
in the system management mode , the entire functionality of the module is available . this is divided into three tabs :
the Network Interface Panel serves to manage network devices of the system . all available network devices are displayed . the following tasks can be performed by the rider network interfaces :
the settings of network interfaces that are displayed can be set up by selecting the desired device in the list and clicking the button ... in the Device Dialog Device .
by default , only basic TCP / IP settings are available . click the Advanced Settings button to display the dialog with further options .
by selecting Automati@@ cally the TCP / IP settings are fet@@ ched from a DH@@ CP server or BO@@ O@@ TP server . in automatic mode , the TCP / IP settings for the system are performed at the same time with the start of the system services . the DH@@ CP or BO@@ O@@ TP server sends all necessary TCP / IP information at every system start so no further adjustment is required . either DH@@ CP or BO@@ O@@ TP , according to the system , can be selected .
in the input field IP address , the desired TCP / IP address must be specified . in the net@@ mask input field , the sub@@ net mask must be specified .
if this setting is selected , the system initi@@ alizes the network interface during bo@@ oting . if the initi@@ alization is not desired , this option should not be activated .
the values entered in this dialog are displayed as properties of the device in the device list .
it should be ensured that the IP address in the network is not already used . entering an already existing IP address would lead to a TCP / IP conflict . with ping in the &amp; console , you can determine if the desired address is already in use . in doubt the network administrator should be asked .
network devices can be activated or disabled according to your needs . switching on an out@@ dated network device is activated by selecting from the list and clicking on the interface ....
network devices can be activated or disabled according to your needs . switching off an activated network device can be de@@ activated by selecting from the list and clicking the interface .
defines the host &apos;s IP address in the local sub@@ net , which con@@ veys the physical connection to remote networks and is used by default for TCP / IP communication with computers in other sub@@ nets .
if there is more than one network interface on the computer , the interface to the network in which the gateway computer is located must be selected .
a computer with DNS support replaces a full domain name by the corresponding IP address . this is necessary because computers can only understand IP addresses . if the machine asks ht@@ t@@ p : / / www.@@ ein@@ ed@@ om@@ ain@@ .org , DNS will solve this name in an IP address like 12@@ 3.@@ 4@@ 5.@@ 67@@ 8.@@ 90 .
the name resolution part of the name resolution calcul@@ ator allows for easy management of this list . entries can be added , removed or altered . DNS records can be renamed to the list by selecting an entry and / or down@@ gra@@ ding in the list with buttons .
by clicking the button Add ... a DNS server can be added from the group hosts to the name resolution . it will be added to the New Name Server dialog .
first you need to enter the IP address of the DNS server and then click the Add button . the entry will then be inserted in the list .
from the group calcul@@ ator to the name resolution , select an entry and then click the Edit button .... There will be the Edit dialog .
the list of known calcul@@ ators describes machine name @-@ to @-@ IP address links for the TCP / IP sub@@ system . it is used primarily for bo@@ oting when no DNS servers are available . in small , remote networks , it can replace DNS servers .
usually the list of names well known hosts some entries , the &amp; ap@@ os ; loc@@ al@@ host@@ ap@@ os ; and some special IP@@ v@@ 6 addresses . this still in the test version of IP should replace version 4 in the future .
enter the IP address of the known computer and click Add .... The New alias dialog will be displayed .
enter the name of the known machine and click the Add button . if the known machine has several alias names , press the Add button several times and enter the other alias names .
select an entry of a name known by name from the list and select Edit .... The dialog Con@@ si@@ dering Calcul@@ ator will be displayed .
it can be performed one of the following tasks , then clicking OK will update the list of static hosts .
the settings made in the Network Set@@ ting module are not immediately effective in the system . to activate the changes you need to use the following command .
the home page of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; is ht@@ t@@ p : / / k@@ net@@ work@@ conf@@ .@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net , from which you can download the latest version of the source code .
for the installation of binary distri@@ butions ( usually rpm packages ) it is enough , if &amp; k@@ de ; and Q@@ t installed .
the installation of the finished compiled version is recommended for less experienced users . it is easy to download the rpm package and install it in a &amp; Con@@ sole ; with rpm as follows :
alternatively , a graphical interface can be used as a package or the installation tool of your distribution .
for this case , the installation of Q@@ t and &amp; k@@ de is sufficient ; in addition , the development packages are needed with libraries and other things .
this is recommended only to experienced users , but it is not difficult to compile &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ .@@ conf . the following commands should do this .
in the first section of this chapter , important information about basic network technology will be given , in the second section all of the &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf , changing configuration files will be discussed .
this section cannot replace further knowledge of IP networks . in this app@@ endi@@ x , only basic information about the integration of the PC is conveyed into a small ( home ) network .
IP networks are currently being operated using TCP / IP version 4 ( IP@@ v@@ 4 ) . IP@@ v@@ 5 has never found widespread use . IP@@ v@@ 6 is expected to continue in the near future .
one of the most important information is the IP address of a network interface . in foreign networks , at &amp; eg ; workplace , the network administrator is the contact point , which provides a valid IP address or if available , DH@@ CP can be used . in any case , the IP address cannot be chosen freely .
when setting up an own small ( home ) network , the IP address should be selected from a dedicated area reserved for this purpose to avoid IP address conflicts with the global ( Internet ) network .
of course , access to the Internet for such machines can be made possible by setting a g@@ ate@@ ways .
for smaller networks addresses in the area of 19@@ 2.@@ 16@@ 8.@@ 1.1 to 19@@ 2.@@ 16@@ 8.@@ 1.@@ 25@@ 4 are used . the area is large enough for networks up to 250 computers .
in addition , the net@@ mask is usually set to 25@@ 5.@@ 25@@ 5.@@ 25@@ 5.0 so that all hosts are in the same sub@@ net .
some addresses are reserved for special things , 0.0@@ eg ; .@@ 0.0 and 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 . the first is the so @-@ called standard route , the second is the lo@@ op@@ back address ( loc@@ al@@ host = your own computer ) . the default route is required for the IP forwarding .
the network address 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 is reserved for IP traffic in the local machine . normally , the address 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 is assigned to a custom lo@@ op@@ back interface that works like a closed circuit .
this section contains the configuration files that are affected by &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ .@@ conf and where they are stored in the various distri@@ butions .
this file is sometimes dynamically changed for DSL connections , so it will not be surprised if there is a different content found in the case of active DSL connections .
for &amp; Su@@ SE ; it is known that this file is random@@ ly sorted by the scripts in the Su@@ SE system . a different stand than expected can therefore occur .

&amp; k@@ dat ; is a backup program for tape drives based on tar . it provides the ability to store multiple archives on a tape . the first was to create a surface for tar which also provided the ability of dd@@ s@@ 2@@ tar for quick , selective package . the second goal was to answer a question that my wife asked : how much longer does it take if you secure ?
before a tape can be used , it must be included in &amp; k@@ dat ; it can happen in three ways :
&amp; k@@ dat ; give the tape back and read the pre @-@ tension@@ ing information of the tape . detect &amp; k@@ dat ; don &apos;t know the template on the tape , you &apos;ll be asked if the tape is to be format@@ ted .
recognizes &amp; k@@ dat ; the template , it looks for the appropriate index on your disk . if it cannot be found , you &apos;ll be asked if the band index should be recre@@ ated .
if everything went smoothly , the symbol for the tape drive changes to indicate that the tape was involved . in the status bar a corresponding message appears . the contents of the tape can now be brow@@ sed by folding the entry for the band .
before ej@@ ecting the tape , the integration must first be solved . there are three methods to accomplish this :
&amp; k@@ dat ; shows through a change of the symbol for the tape that the integration for the tape has been resolved and shows a corresponding message in the status bar . the tape can now be ej@@ ected without danger .
before a tape can be used by &amp; k@@ dat ; it must be format@@ ted by &amp; k@@ dat ;
a tape file must be format@@ ted before you can be used to store data . if your tape drive assumes that a tape has to be format@@ ted before use , this must happen before you can format the tape from &amp; k@@ dat ; Flo@@ ppy drives usually require format@@ ting of the tape , while DA@@ T drives do not .
after entering the band name and the capacity , the tape continues . all data on the tape is lost ! after completion of the format@@ ting process , the tape is automatically integrated and ready to use .
before you initiate the backup process , you need to select the files to be secured , which can happen in three ways :
select a file or folder in the local file tree . it will only backup this file or folder .
select a backup profile in the tree . only the files specified in the profile are backed up .
select files in the local file tree with a hook . only the selected files and / or sub@@ folders will be backed up .
ri@@ ght@@ click the local file tree and select Save ...
once the backup has been started , the Settings dialog opens . in this dialog you can check the selected files again and change the backup settings .
when you have confirmed the settings , the dialog box appears . the dialog displays the progress of the backup process , including the data rate and the remaining time .
select a file or folder in one of the archives in the entry for the drive . only the selected file or folder will be checked .
select the files in one of the archives in the entry for the tape with a hook . only the selected files and / or sub@@ folders are checked .
ri@@ ght@@ click in any of the archives and select the menu item Check ....
once the verification process has been started , the dialog appears for review . in this dialog you can check your selection once again and change the working folder for verification .
if you have confirmed the settings for the verification , the dialog will be checked . this dialog displays the progress of the audit process as well as the data throughput and the remaining time .
before you can initiate the restore , the files to be recovered must be selected . this can be done in two ways :
select a file or folder in one of the archives belonging to the tape drive . only the selected file or sub@@ folder will be restored .
select the files you want from one of the archives with a hook . only the selected files and / or sub@@ folders will be restored .
ri@@ ght@@ click a file or folder in one of the archives and select Rest@@ ore in the Menu ...
once the restore process has been started , the dialog will display settings for recovery . in this dialog , you can check your selection once again and change the working folder for recovery .
once you have confirmed the restore settings , the dialog will appear . this dialog displays the progress of the restore process as well as the data throughput and the remaining time .
sometimes it proves to be necessary to recre@@ ate the tape index on the basis of the tape content . this procedure del@@ etes all existing index files for this band . you can create the index on two types of the tape :
this creates a backup profile with the currently selected files and the default settings . you can set the following settings for a backup profile :
the current working folder where the backup is to take place . the list of files to be secured will be automatically updated according to the currently selected working folder .
for all folders specified in backup files , only the files that reside on the same fil@@ esystem , like the folder . folders that are on other file systems , can be entered separately under backup files . each entry is considered by tar regardless of the other file system .
perform an incre@@ mental backup . to determine which files have changed since the last incre@@ mental backup , a snapshot file is used . only the files that have changed since then are backed up .
the name of the file used to determine the changes since the last incre@@ mental backup .
del@@ etes the snapshot file before calling tar . this causes all files to be backed up and a new snapshot file is created for the next backup .
the functionality of the buttons files &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ;
the settings can be set up via the menu item K@@ D@@ at ... in the Settings menu . the following settings can be done :
the complete path to the device file for the tape drive ( usually / dev / tape ) . this path must refer to the non @-@ re@@ winding option of the tape device .
if this setting is active , send and k@@ dat ; before the tape is involved , load load to the drive . for some drives , this is necessary before read or write operations can be performed .
if the option is turned on , try &amp; k@@ dat ; unlock the throw of the tape drive . possibly this setting does not work with all tape drives .
if the option is turned on , when un@@ plug@@ ging the &amp; k@@ dat record , the band will be automatically ej@@ ected . do not use this option for flo@@ ppy @-@ stre@@ amer .
if the option is turned on , try &amp; k@@ dat ; not all drives support variable block sizes . not all drives support variable block sizes . no matter if this setting is active or not , you need &amp; k@@ dat ; in any case , tell the block size for your tape drive .
if &amp; k@@ dat ; a tape format@@ ted , it writes a file to the beginning of the tape . this file should only occupy a memory block on the tape . the contents of the file is composed as follows :
( n Byte ) The band ID . the format of this string is host@@ name : seconds , where the host@@ name is the complete name of the system on which the tape was format@@ ted . seconds is the number of seconds that have passed since the period in which the tape was format@@ ted .
the band ID is used to find a file with the same name in the $ HO@@ ME / .@@ k@@ dat file .
the remaining files on the tape are pure tar archives , which can be administr@@ ated directly with &amp; GNU ; even other tar versions should work as long as they are not incre@@ mental back@@ ups .
check the contents of a backup tape . this symbol is only active when a tape is involved .
&amp; k@@ system@@ log ; is a &amp; k@@ de ; Viewer for System Lo@@ gs . the program is suitable for inexperienced users who do not know where to get information about your system , or where the system stores the different protocol files . furthermore , &amp; k@@ system@@ log allows users to quickly access information about problems that occur on their server .
&amp; k@@ system@@ log ; helps users understand what your computer is doing in the background . the task of &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; is a simplified representation of the protocol files of your own system . the program is suitable for inexperienced users who do not know where to get information about your system or where the system stores the different protocol files .
in addition , &amp; k@@ system@@ log allows experienced users to quickly access information about problems that occur on their server . &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; hence , attempts to provide some advanced functions that allow the protocol files to be filtered and evaluated by specific programs .
the current version 0.@@ 4.1 has &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; a number of useful functions . among other things , this includes :
support for many different types of log files , for the format of the Sy@@ slo@@ g server and for Sam@@ ba
many other functions are also included and are explained in the further chapters of this manual .
as you see in the following screen@@ shot , &amp; k@@ system@@ log provides functions to easily filter and sort the individual protocol lines of a protocol file . the individual options for sorting and filtering are shown in the next chapter of this manual .
after the start tries &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; first the most important protocol file of the system - to open the system protocol . if you don &apos;t see it , and it opens instead of its a small message window , you have &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; very probably not with system administrator rights . the protocol files are usually found in the folder / var / log , for normal users usually do not have permission to read .
you can also use the filter strip to filter after a selected criterion or by input strings . the list of the log @-@ lines will now be changed automatically , so that only the protocol lines match the filter . in the default setting , a log line will only be displayed if the string of the filter search term is contained in one of the columns .
you can of course select another entry at this point . the string of the filter search term will then be compared only with the entries in the corresponding column . for example , select the process column in the protocol file system log , and enter the name of a process in the protocol file system log , so show you &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; all the protocol lines that were sent or created by this process .
this option is enabled in the default setting and helps you to recognize the important protocol lines . protocol lines of level errors are displayed with a more eye @-@ catching color than minutes lines of the level critic . the colored representation of minutes lines can be turned off setup dialog .
if you want to display only certain processes ( for example in the system protocol or in the C@@ ron protocol ) , you can hide the process identification ( PID ) in the process column . this can be useful , for example , if you want to examine the output of a particular command such as the start of the sam@@ ba server . in this case , use Filter Panel .
in addition , you can select the option To skip new lines in the main window context menu to view all the new lines that are added .
&amp; k@@ system@@ log ; allows to display multiple protocol files in separate sub@@ windows . to use this feature , use the entries in the window to open and manage additional sub @-@ windows . once you have selected a sub @-@ window , select a protocol to display in the menu .
&amp; k@@ system@@ log ; has its own website on ht@@ t@@ p : / / k@@ system@@ log@@ .@@ forum @-@ softwar@@ e.@@ or@@ g. d@@ ort you can find more up @-@ to @-@ date information about the sources of &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; .
&amp; k@@ system@@ log ; also find in the following folder of the &amp; k@@ de ; Subversion archive : k@@ system@@ log ; in &amp; k@@ de ; archive
welcome to the &amp; k@@ de ; System V In@@ it Editor , rather known ( and named in the following ) as &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; This section introduces a few concepts and describes what you can do with &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v .
the system V In@@ it quickly becomes the standard for the control of program starts when launching the system in the &amp; Linux world . this is because it is easier to use , more powerful and at the same time more flexible than the traditional BSD In@@ it .
here I will not go further into historical aspects ( e.g. because I don &apos;t know about it myself : - ) .
the in@@ it binary file is below / s@@ bin and not under / etc . this is important because maybe someone might try to change a machine to System V In@@ it without re@@ installing and re@@ format@@ ting . so you must make sure that the old In@@ it file was removed from there if there was one .
the Sy@@ s@@ V In@@ it also differs from the BSD In@@ it , that the configuration files are located in a sub@@ folder of / etc instead of directly in / etc . this folder is called r@@ c.@@ sy@@ sin@@ it and the following folders :
in@@ it@@ .@@ d contains a whole lot of scripts . basically you need a script for every system service you want to start when you boot up the system or when switching to another run@@ level . system services do not include such things as network , NFS , &amp; S@@ end@@ mail ; , ht@@ tp@@ d &amp; etc ; system services do not include such things as set@@ serial , which is only started once . such calls belong to r@@ c.@@ local .
r@@ c.@@ local should be in / etc / r@@ c.@@ d if you need it . most systems have this file , even if there is not much use for it . you can also create a r@@ c.@@ serial in / etc / r@@ c.@@ d if you want to do something with the serial port .
the kernel looks at different places after the program in@@ it and starts the first one that it finds .
the default run@@ level is entered in / etc / in@@ it@@ tab . you should see in the beginning section a line like the following :
at this point , you can take a look at the second column and probably find that the default Run@@ Level 3 is 3 . if you want to change that , you can edit / etc / in@@ it@@ tab from hand and change the 3 . if you have confused something , then you can fix it by re@@ bo@@ oting the system and exec@@ uting the following :
but how does all the correct scripts now start ? if you type ls -@@ l in r@@ c@@ 3.@@ d , then you &apos;ll probably see something like the following :
you will notice that there are no real files in this folder . instead , each entry is a link to one of the scripts in the in@@ it@@ .@@ d directory .
how to start and stop in@@ it actually system services ? quite simple : each of the scripts is written in such a way that it accepts an argument like start and stop . you can actually start these scripts manually on the command line as follows :
this would stop the ht@@ tp@@ d server . in@@ it reads the name , and if it contains a K , the script will be called with the argument stop . if it contains an S , the script will be called with the argument start .
some people want a simple way to set up machines for many purposes . I could have a server run@@ level that only ht@@ tp@@ d , &amp; S@@ end@@ mail ; , network &amp; etc ; run . furthermore , I could also have a user run@@ level , which &amp; eg ; &amp; k@@ d@@ m ; , network &amp; etc ; starts .
here you learn the use of &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; it should not be very difficult because the program was designed as user @-@ friendly as possible .
the use of &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; with a mouse or another pointing device is easy to not say tri@@ vial : simply drag an entry from the area of available system services to one of the six run@@ level to start it at this level ( or stop ) .
you can also move scripts between Run@@ level@@ n or change the position within a level by moving it somewhere else . the entry is removed from its original Run@@ level ( or its position ) . this only happens if you pull out an entry from the area of available system services .
note : entries will be moved when you move them to a new area . to simply copy them to a new run level , you must explicitly select Copy from the Edit menu or from the context menu and paste into the target area -- even when the same entry has existed previously in the target range of the action .
the sorting number of an entry can sometimes not be calculated . in such a case , you need to edit the sorting numbers of the surrounding items before you can again try to insert the system service .
note : currently there is no way to restore entries thrown into the recy@@ cle bin . so be careful .
you can use the tab key to activate the different working areas ( Avail@@ able system services , Run@@ Level 1 Start , Run@@ Level 1 Stop &amp; etc ; ) as well as the cursor keys to make a selection above or below the previous one .
to move an entry to another run@@ level , move it with cut into the clip@@ board ( you can also use C@@ trl ; X ) and insert it into the desired run@@ level with inser@@ ting ( with C@@ trl + V ) .
to change the sorting number or the name of an entry manually , press the input key to change the Properties dialog . use the tab key to switch between different fields . close the dialog by pressing the input key to accept the changes , or press Es@@ c to disc@@ ard the changes .
because of the danger of data loss , all entries in the File menu require a confirmation before they are executed .
all settings are saved in $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / config / k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c . def@@ aults are retri@@ eved from the global file ( $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / config / k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c ) if it is available . otherwise they are recovered by &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; changes to the default settings are stored in a local k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c .
I experim@@ ented with the standard Run@@ level@@ n , and now the machine boots up constantly . what can I do ?
enter the LI@@ LO prompt lin@@ ux single and press the input key to start in single @-@ user mode . then edit the file / etc / in@@ it@@ tab and change the default run@@ level to a reasonable value ( 3 should be fine ) .
I have some system services with &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; designed for run level X , but they are not executed .
if you use &amp; Su@@ SE ; or Deli@@ x ( D@@ LD ) then you need to edit additional files in / etc that are only available in these distri@@ butions .
the way system services are started in these distri@@ butions , simpli@@ fies the configuration for the proprietary set @-@ up programs of these distri@@ butions , but unfortunately does not meet any standard . authors of &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; plan an extension of the program for this approach .
if you are using another distribution , please check that all configuration files are present , which are required by the respective system service ( and also if they are in the right directory ) . some services ( such as &amp; eg ; Apache and ht@@ tp@@ d ) simply exit without message if their configuration files are not present or in@@ correctly set up .
the importance of the &amp; Linux ; -@@ Run@@ level varies from distribution to distribution , can even be different from version to version . if you are using another distribution , please send me information about the run@@ level so that this manual can be added to this manual .
this documentation refers to &amp; k@@ user ; 1.0 . with this program you can manage the users and groups of your system .
to start with &amp; k@@ user , it is sufficient to read the chapter adaptation of &amp; k@@ user ; to read .
after you have made changes , you must save them . either use the corresponding toolbar icon or save the Save in the File menu .
the main window consists of two flash@@ cards , the user and the user group list . for editing , select the desired user or group by double @-@ clicking on the entry .
some card cards are only displayed when you have advanced system settings . only when you activate space limitations ( quot@@ a ) for users , a card card will be created on which you can set individual settings . other flash@@ cards will appear if shadow passwords , or for example / etc / master@@ .@@ pass@@ w@@ d , are installed as in BSD Uni@@ xes .
the password management card card appears if shadow passwords or , for example , / etc / master@@ .@@ pass@@ w@@ d are installed as in BSD Uni@@ xes .
this card card only appears if the space limitation ( quot@@ a ) is enabled and initi@@ alized for at least one embedded file system ( recognizable by the file quot@@ a.@@ user / quot@@ a.@@ group on the file system ) .
these parameters can be set individually for each file system . the current file system is selected with the help of the file system with space limitation .
the index card groups are informed about the group affili@@ ation of the selected user . the default group , to which the user belongs , can be found in the Pri@@ mary Group field . furthermore , the user can become a member in other groups by selecting them in the large field .
the dialog &apos;s Properties dialog contains a list of all users . to add a user to the group , select this user in the list .
to add a user or group , select Add from the User or Group menu or click the appropriate Add button on the toolbar . editing or del@@ eting the selected user or group will work an@@ alog@@ ously .
with this module , you can install the LI@@ LO boot manager , add , remove , and modify the boot password , change the time to the boot of the standard operating system , add the default operating system , remove , change operating systems , remove , modify , and more .
