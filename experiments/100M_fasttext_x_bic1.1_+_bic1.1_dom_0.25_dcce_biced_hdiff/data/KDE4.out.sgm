<seg id="1">The module website can be translated in the & konqueror; menu under Extras website. select the source and target language of the translation from the drop-down list.</seg>
<seg id="2">If a part of the text is selected, only this part will be translated into place of the entire & URL;</seg>
<seg id="3">Machine translations are only very rudimentary. in the best case Babelfish produces a rough translation and in the worst case nonsense. therefore, the translations should not make any important decisions, without checking the translation beforehand.</seg>
<seg id="4">Only websites on the Internet can be translated. other texts should be translated on the Babelfish page itself, where you can paste text directly.</seg>
<seg id="5">The package & package; contains several modules for & konqueror; despite its small size, they offer some additional functions and simplify the use of some features of & konqueror; by making this easier available.</seg>
<seg id="6">Further information on the use of & konqueror; and the built-in functions can be found in the manual on & konqueror;.</seg>
<seg id="7">To load these modules in & konqueror, choose Settings Extensions.... Open the card card tools and select the modules you want.</seg>
<seg id="8">This is a list of standard settings modules from the box, addons. please note that if you have additional software installed, you may have more modules installed on your system.</seg>
<seg id="9">You should install the kdebase package, the & konqueror, before you compile it.</seg>
<seg id="10">To use the crash module, click & konqueror; on Extras Figures. then you can view the page that has brought down & konqueror; or the list of crashes, if available.</seg>
<seg id="11">The Module Anchor Filter (also called folder filter) can be reached in the & konqueror; menu bar under Extras Insight filter. with the module you can filter & konqueror; 's current working directory in different ways.</seg>
<seg id="12">To use the DOM tree view in & konqueror, select Extras DOM tree... and open a new window with the DOM of the currently displayed website. as default, the display begins with the root node of the document, example: documentElement, all other nodes are subelements of this root node.</seg>
<seg id="13">The module & FSView; for & konqueror; provides a further view for objects with the MIME type inode / directory for local files. it can be used as an alternative for the various symbol and text views to view the content of your local file system.</seg>
<seg id="14">The peculiarity of & FSView; consists of plotting nested hierarchies with the help of a so-called tree map. tree maps allow the representation of the size of objects in nested structures. each object is represented by a rectangle whose surface is proportional to its size.</seg>
<seg id="15">With & FSView, the size is the size of a file or folder, whereby the size of a folder is defined as the sum of the size of the entries in it. thus, large files can be easily identified, even if they are far below in the folder hierarchy. thus, & FSView may be seen as a graphical and interactive version of the & UNIX Â® -command.</seg>
<seg id="16">In & FSView; is an entry in the Treemap representation a rectangle representing a file or folder in your filesystem. for simpler navigation, the rectangles possess meaningful coloring and labelling settings.</seg>
<seg id="17">The color of a rectangle that is switched over view color mode can either be depth for easy detection of the nesting depth or the illustration of another file property such as name, owner, group or MIME type.</seg>
<seg id="18">A rectangle can be labeled with the different properties of the appropriate file or folder. for each property you can specify whether it is displayed at all, only if there is enough space to display, or whether the area of subordinate rectangle should be used (whereby, therefore, you can specify the relative position of the lettering in the rectangle.</seg>
<seg id="19">With display algorithms for Treemaps, the rule should be complied with that the area is proportional to the size of the entry. with the Treemap in & FSView, this target is not always complied with.</seg>
<seg id="20">How to split the area of an entry for the subordinate entries remains to be left to the implementation. in this context, it is always advantageous for the labeling and avoidance of space losses in such a way as to create rectangles that are as square as possible. the best methods of this are rows, columns or recursive divisions.</seg>
<seg id="21">You can define the minimally displayed area for an entry via the menu entry View Viewing With Area. instead, a diamond pattern is drawn into the area of the parent entry to indicate that this area is actually occupied by a subordinate entry.</seg>
<seg id="22">Originally, & FSView; designed as a small test application and introduction to the use of the TreeMap widgets developed for the application of Cachegrind.</seg>
<seg id="23">The Picture Gallery module can be found in the & konqueror; menu under Extras image gallery... or with Ctrl; I.</seg>
<seg id="24">When you visit the Picture Gallery module, you will open a dialog with which you can define the image of the gallery.</seg>
<seg id="25">The title of the page allows you to adjust the title of the picture gallery page in a text input field.</seg>
<seg id="26">The option Pictures per line has a slider and a script to adjust the number of thumbnails of each row in the gallery.</seg>
<seg id="27">The File name of the image will show if the file names are displayed in the gallery under the thumbnails.</seg>
<seg id="28">With the image file size of the image, specify whether the file size is displayed under the thumbnails in the gallery.</seg>
<seg id="29">With the image size check box, specify whether the size of the images is displayed in the gallery under the thumbnails.</seg>
<seg id="30">In the Folder dialog, select where the gallery will be stored and which subfolders are to be included.</seg>
<seg id="31">In the Save in HTML file, specify where to store the HTML page.</seg>
<seg id="32">The subfolder can be connected to the subfolder via a slider or a script, up to which level the subfolders will be included.</seg>
<seg id="33">You can copy the original pictures with the check box to see if the original images are to be copied to the gallery.</seg>
<seg id="34">Use the comment file to use a comment file for the caption of the images in the gallery.</seg>
<seg id="35">In the check box Own color depth, you can set a different color depth for the thumbnails than in the original pictures.</seg>
<seg id="36">The module & HTML; settings gives you easy access to the general & HTML; settings for & konqueror;.</seg>
<seg id="37">The module & HTML; -Settings can be found in the & konqueror; menu under Extras HTML Settings. the following behavior of the web browser can be specified here:</seg>
<seg id="38">The media playback for the navigation pane can be found in the & konqueror; view menu under the navigation pane or with the keyboard shortcut F9.</seg>
<seg id="39">To play, click the & konqueror's navigation area; and drag the music files you want to hear in the media playback.</seg>
<seg id="40">Change your browser identifier add a menu entry in & konqueror; add to which you can change browser and operating system identifier for individual domains. this is useful for websites that allow access only with certain browsers.</seg>
<seg id="41">The default browser detection of the & konqueror; is Mozilla / 5.0 (compatible; Conqueror / 3.3; Linux) (KHTML, like Gecko). if you come to a web page that refuses to access this browser, change the browser identifier in one of the following options.</seg>
<seg id="42">Change the password in MSIE for pages which reject the access with browsers on the basis of Mozilla. for example, you need the MSIE browser detection to call with the & konqueror; Hotmail.</seg>
<seg id="43">Pages that do not correspond to the W3C standard or use the own & HTML; - Elements and attributes are displayed correctly with the identification of these obsolete browsers.</seg>
<seg id="44">With this option, the browser identifier is used for all pages of the website you are currently visiting.</seg>
<seg id="45">With the menu item Set Up... you can set the scope of the information about the browser and operating system in the individual.</seg>
<seg id="46">With this & konqueror; -module check your & CSS; style sheets and & HTML; -documents in accordance with the recommendations of W3C and other standards.</seg>
<seg id="47">The module website can be checked in the & konqueror; check the menu under Extras website. you can make the following checks:</seg>
<seg id="48">With the & HTML, check if your & HTML; -document of the syntax of & HTML; matches, all found errors will be displayed. with this check, you can make sure your pages are displayed correctly by all browsers.</seg>
<seg id="49">Allows you to review your & CSS; style sheets embedded in an & HTML; - or & XHTML; document. with valid & CSS; your web pages have a unified look regardless of browser used.</seg>
<seg id="50">Check the links on your page on redirects and faulty links. recursively all links on the website are reviewed.</seg>
<seg id="51">Here you place the addresses of the servers for checking your & HTML; -documents and & CSS; -style sheets.</seg>
<seg id="52">With the module Web-Archivierer for & konqueror; you can store web pages with text and pictures in .was format.</seg>
<seg id="53">Use the mouse to archive the website and a dialog appears to save the displayed website.</seg>
<seg id="54">The module Web-Archivierer is Copyright & copy; 2001-2003 Andreas Schlapbach, Antonio Larossa and Malte Starostik sipbh @ iam.unibe.ch larossa @ kde.org widte @ kde.org</seg>
<seg id="55">An easy-to-use camera interface will be made available to you to connect to your digital camera and download your photos directly in & digip. more than 1000 digital cameras are supported with the gPhoto2 library. of course, each media and card reader supported by your operating system will work with & digiplug; work together.</seg>
<seg id="56">& edited; includes fast image processing with basic image editing tools. you can use them to view, comment, rate and correct your photos. editing capabilities can easily be extended using KDE Image Plug-In Interface (manual) modules.</seg>
<seg id="57">Although & edited; easy to use, it provides dozens of professional capabilities. it works entirely in 16-bit color space and all available modules support raw conversion via libraw, DNG export and ICC color management workflow.</seg>
<seg id="58">Improved database with much more metadata, such as & eg; via the camera or lens that can be searched.</seg>
<seg id="59">Like all & kde; programs is also & digitized; an open source project. that means it depends on the support of end users. therefore, you should report problems and improvement possibilities.</seg>
<seg id="60">& edited; tries to make the reporting of problems or suggestions as easy as possible for them. wherever you are in the program, the Help menu will open a page in the error report system. if you use these links, your web browser opens a page in the error reporting system. all the information you need is already registered here. just follow the instructions to send your report.</seg>
<seg id="61">& edited; is a project supported by a community. that is, the user and developer will help each other. if you are a regular user of & digikam, then we would like to encourage you to answer questions other users of & digikam. in this mailing list, however, English is spoken, you should therefore be powerful in this language.</seg>
<seg id="62">You can also edit the digicode; visit homepage to learn news about shared versions and other information about & digikam.</seg>
<seg id="63">The best start to get started & edited is logging in in the developer mailing list. instructions to login to the developer mailing list of & digiplug;.</seg>
<seg id="64">When you start & edit; for the first time, you'll be asked where to save your pictures and your database. you can specify a local, remote or removable folder. simply enter the path name or click the folder icon Folder icon to select a folder.</seg>
<seg id="65">In the second field you need to specify a local folder on your computer. here the data abnad is stored. this path stays the same for all image folders.</seg>
<seg id="66">Later you can add as many folders as you want. & digiplug; will additionally use as an Albenbibliothek.</seg>
<seg id="67">If you already have a picture collection on your hard disk, you can specify the top folder containing pictures as the base folder. no picture will be changed. while browsing the folders you get a progress indicator like this:</seg>
<seg id="68">& edited; thirdly recursively the library path in its entire depth. you cannot exclude sub-folders unless it is in hidden folder. you can do this by adding one point in front of the name of the subfolder.</seg>
<seg id="69">If you take an existing folder with photos as a base folder, you will notice that the albums in My Albenliste do not have any photos as symbols. you can change them by taking a photo from the album and taking it on the folder icon.</seg>
<seg id="70">Once you have configured the base folder, you can set up your digital camera. after that, you should learn how to use My Albums and My Selflists to manage your photos in the albums.</seg>
<seg id="71">Raw file support: if you use the raw mode of your camera, & digiplug may also handle it. support is based on the libraw library. if you want to figure out if a specific camera is supported, you will find a list of supported raw cameras in the help shell camera support menu.</seg>
<seg id="72">How to set up this and work with raw files is described in the sections Roh-Decodersetup and Roh workflow.</seg>
<seg id="73">An easy-to-use camera interface will be made available to you to connect to your digital camera and download your photos directly in & digip. more than 1000 digital cameras are supported with the gPhoto2 library. of course, each media and card reader supported by your operating system will work with & digiplug; work together.</seg>
<seg id="74">Modern digital cameras feature the use of Compact & Flash; memory cards and USB or FireWire (IEEE-1394 or i-Link) for data transfer. for actual transmission to the computer, the camera is often used as a disk drive. the camera can also be realized via the Picture Transfer Protocol (PTP) and its derivatives.</seg>
<seg id="75">& digiplug; uses the gPhoto2 program to communicate with digital camera. gPhoto2 also supports the Picture Transfer Protocol, a widely used protocol developed by the International Imaging Industry Association. it allows the transfer of images from digital cameras to computers and other peripherals without the need for additional drivers.</seg>
<seg id="76">Many old digital cameras use the serial port for their communication with the computer. since photos are generally large files and transmissions via the serial port are slow, this connection is now obsolete. & digiplug; supports these cameras and performs the transfer of images with gPhoto2. a complete list of supported cameras can be found under this link.</seg>
<seg id="77">LibgPhoto2 has to be created with libexif support so the thumbnails can be read reliably. if the Exif support is not present in libgphoto2, thumbnails may not be seen or the generation could be very slow.</seg>
<seg id="78">One of the most beautiful things about digitizing is how easy it is to expand its functionality through modules:</seg>
<seg id="79">KIPI modules: the KDE Image plugins Interface Project (manual) is an approach to develop a common module structure for & digitizing;, KPhotoAlbum, Showimg and Gwenview. the aim is to provide the modules to all graphics programs. the settings for the KIPI modules are described in this section.</seg>
<seg id="80">Modules can manipulate images in virtually any way, as it can also be a user. their advantage is that it is much easier, & edited; by writing a small module to add a function when the changes in & digiplug; even carry out.</seg>
<seg id="81">To simplify the window, you can either remove the side rails with & LMB; remove or switch to full screen mode with F11 or Ctrl + Shift + F.</seg>
<seg id="82">Drag and drop images works everywhere: you can lay an image in another part of the tree, above the horizontal divider line or in another application window. the only limitation is that one image cannot be stored in keywords, data list or search.</seg>
<seg id="83">- a file type selection allows you to stand out the most common: JPEG, PNG, TIFF, Roh, Movies and Audio</seg>
<seg id="84">The text filter will only be used for the fields displayed in the toolbar. thus, filtering on the filename only works if this is shown in the symbol view. which fields are displayed can be configured in the dialog of the AlbenSettings.</seg>
<seg id="85">The View & quot; My Albenlisteeper; provides an organized view on your photo albums. all photos stored by & digikam are stored in a single album tree. these albums can be sorted according to the folders in which they were stored on the hard disk, on the name of their collection in the album properties or after the date on which the album was first created. the date can be changed in the properties of the album.</seg>
<seg id="86">If you have set up a scanner, you can also scan a photo directly into an album. you can also select Album importing images. you can also add a screenshot to an album directly.</seg>
<seg id="87">To copy or move a picture from one album to another, you can move the photo with the mouse to the target album and drop it there. in the then appearing menu you must select whether the image is moved by moving or copying. you can also move or copy several photos in the same way. simply select all the photos and move them to the target album.</seg>
<seg id="88">An album contains a collection of photos and the album properties allow you to enter information about this collection. to access the album features, right click on the album and select album properties in the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="89">Album collections: are a method to mark your albums so that you can be grouped together under a common name. the collection from you is used to sort your photos by selecting or selecting albums from the toolbar. if you want to add or delete new collections, you can do this in the settings for collections.</seg>
<seg id="90">The album date: is used when you sort your albums by date with View albums by date.</seg>
<seg id="91">The oldest, average, new testers: these places the date on the oldest, the newest picture or the average of the album. to do this, first tries to calculate the average of the images from their EXIF information. if this fails, instead, the date of last modification of each file is used in this folder.</seg>
<seg id="92">If you first have an album in & edited, the first picture in the album will be selected as a symbol for the & quot; My Albenlistequot; selected. sometimes the first photo on the album is not representative and you might want to select another photo as a symbol.</seg>
<seg id="93">To select another photo as an album icon, you must click the image with the right mouse button and select it in the context menu & quot; As album preview wenquot; in addition, you can drag the picture to the album in the list to set it as a symbol.</seg>
<seg id="94">An album can always be included in a collection and collections cannot be discarded.</seg>
<seg id="95">& edited; supports the input of key words for individual photos in the section My keywordlist on the bottom of the main window. album collections have a different effect. the collection always includes all photos of the album. you can of course use both methods to organize your photos.</seg>
<seg id="96">The image window will provide you with the main view of your photos. if you select an album, all images in this album will be displayed in the image window. each photo is displayed in a preview, you can adjust the size of this preview with the two magnifying glass buttons in the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="97">If you open an album the first time, you need to wait a little while the thumbnails are generated. you can avoid this by using the Tools menu to recreate all preview images.</seg>
<seg id="98">Information on each image will be displayed below the corresponding preview. what information is this, you can change the settings digitized; set up the page and adjust the range of thumbnails to your preferences.</seg>
<seg id="99">The thumbnails feature help windows that appear. if you leave the mouse pointer a moment over a picture, the help shows the most important features including all the keywords of a photo. the screenshot at the top of the Introduction to the main window shows such an help window.</seg>
<seg id="100">Photos are everything from & digikam. albums and keywords allow you to organize your pictures as it suits you. you can reach all the functions that can be done with & edited. you can reach all the functions that can be edited with & edited. you can choose between viewing the pictures, a slide show or editing the images.</seg>
<seg id="101">You can open the image editing with a photo by right-clicking either F4 or Edit... or selecting the context menu of the image with the right mouse button and editing... you can find a guide on how to edit your photos. with image editing, you can view your photos and change them.</seg>
<seg id="102">It can happen that & digiplug; the functionality you need is not available. you can open a photo in another program by right-clicking the context menu and selecting the program from the submenu of opening. for this, and how to customize it to your needs if your program is not listed, you will find information in the & kde; manual.</seg>
<seg id="103">You should note that after editing by other image processing programs you can get problems with the metadata contained in the image. some programs do not store this data with when you save the changed image. thus, this information is lost from the EXIF and IPTC data, such as orientation, aperture, etc.</seg>
<seg id="104">& edit; provides two options for rotation. the easiest way is to click the right mouse button to preview and rotate. in the submenu you can specify the degree of rotation.</seg>
<seg id="105">To change the file name of a photo, you can right click on the preview and select F2 rename from the context menu. note that you will retain the extension (.jpg, .tif, & etc;).</seg>
<seg id="106">If you delete a photo from & edited, it will be moved to the garbage bin by & kde; moved. F8 Picture Delete or Delete If you prefer to really delete, you can use this by using Shift + Del.</seg>
<seg id="107">The View & quot; My Datumstringquot; organizes your photos based on data. & edited; use either the EXIF date or, if this is not available, the date of last modification of the file.</seg>
<seg id="108">If you select a month from the list, all photos of this month will be displayed in the picture view. you can select days or weeks in the date sheet below in the date view so that you will only be shown the photos of the selected days.</seg>
<seg id="109">Photos with keyword provides a flexible and powerful way to organize and catalog your photos. keywords are stickers, the individual photos or entire groups can be assigned. once a keyword has been assigned to a photo, the photo can be found by selecting this keyword or a search again.</seg>
<seg id="110">When a keyword is selected, all photos that have been marked with this keyword will be shown.</seg>
<seg id="111">Keywords can be sorted into a hierarchical tree. this allows you to organize your keywords logically. you can also fold parts of the tree & quot; My keyword liaison, so that you can easily find the keywords you are looking for.</seg>
<seg id="112">The keywords are stored in a database for fast access and assigned keyword in the IPTC data fields of the image, at least for JPEG. thus, you can also use your keywords in other programs.</seg>
<seg id="113">You can add new keywords by right-clicking either on & quot; My keyword, or click on an existing keyword and then choose Create New keyword. if you have a new keyword after clicking on an existing keyword, this will become the keyword for this keyword.</seg>
<seg id="114">You can delete a keyword by clicking on the keyword with the right mouse button and selecting Delete. if you delete a keyword, the photo itself will not be deleted. only the keyword will be removed from this photo.</seg>
<seg id="115">You can change the position of a keyword by dragging it to the desired position in the tree and place it there. then a menu appears that gives you the option to postpone. a keyword can be at a time only once in a tree.</seg>
<seg id="116">You can change the properties of a keyword by clicking on it with the right mouse button and selecting the keyword in the context menu. you can change the name of the keyword and the symbol in the tree & quot;</seg>
<seg id="117">To select another photo as an album icon, you must click the picture with the right mouse button and select As an album preview in the context menu. in addition, you can drag the picture to the album in the list to set it as a symbol.</seg>
<seg id="118">It can be done in two ways: once you have selected the photos you want to provide with a keyword, you can drag them to the keyword in the tree & quot; My keyword, drag and drop them. alternatively, you can also click the right mouse button to preview the pictures and select keyword names from the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="119">You can tag a photo with any number of keywords. the photo will be displayed as soon as you select one of the keywords assigned to it. in this way you can give a cue for each person on a photo, one for the place where the photo was taken, one for the event where it was made etc.</seg>
<seg id="120">Once you have completed a photo with keyword, it will be displayed in the main window under the preview of the image.</seg>
<seg id="121">You can remove a keyword in which you can right click the context menu of the picture and select from the Tags menu Remove. the menu will show you only the key words assigned to the photo.</seg>
<seg id="122">The timeline view displays a time-dependent histogram of the number of images per time unit. a selection box can be moved using this histogram. to select a time frame, just click on the bottom rectangle of the selection box that indicates the time unit.</seg>
<seg id="123">In the field below, you can enter a title and save your selection. it will appear in the list below.</seg>
<seg id="124">Includes all the elements of the database: names, ratings, keywords, keywords, albums, collections, date stamps and more.</seg>
<seg id="125">Next to the search box is a small lamp that will be green when searching hits. if you click here, the filtering will be deleted and all images will be displayed again. if the search did not find anything, then the lamp will be red.</seg>
<seg id="126">The more advanced search tool is hidden in the tab on the left side bar with the binoculars. if you open this, you get a simple search box as described above. however, you can save this search here as a live search, which always filters what you have entered as a search criteria.</seg>
<seg id="127">If you are satisfied with your selection, press OK and the search will be done. the results will be displayed in my search list in the main window. if you want to change your selection after searching again, you just need to select the appropriate entry from the View My Search list and select an option in its context menu.</seg>
<seg id="128">When you select Search Edit, the search appears again with the previously entered search information. if you select As Advanced Search, the Advanced Search dialog appears to change your previous search. more information can be found in the section The Tool for Advanced Search.</seg>
<seg id="129">If you want to delete an existing search from the list, select Delete in the context menu search.</seg>
<seg id="130">The Advanced Search will provide you with an advanced search form with many search parameters that you can search in certain fields of & digitizing; s database.</seg>
<seg id="131">The list of search rules is used to set the options for a search query in the database. an option can be added to this list with search group / search group will be added or deleted. each option can be combined with others via the logical operations All..., One..., No... or At least... you can also search for type & quot; AND NICHTquot;.</seg>
<seg id="132">& digikam; characterizes each image by a long number with a special technique, the hair algorithm. this allows images to be compared by comparing these signatures. the smaller the difference between two image signatures, the more they correspond. this technique is applied in three areas.</seg>
<seg id="133">Similar entries: this is an area in which you can drop any picture to find a similar one. by using a swellerts, the result selection can be enlarged or reduced. if you slide a picture from somewhere over the icon of the unused search in the left side bar, then it will open and you can drop it there.</seg>
<seg id="134">Sketch: free-hand colour sketch: draw a quick sketch and & edited; find the suitable pictures. also here a threshold value can be set.</seg>
<seg id="135">This tab provides an intuitive card search tool based on the Marble Miniprogram. you can move in or out with the mouse wheel or hold it and move it. move it while you click the left mouse button. all images within these coordinates are filtered and displayed.</seg>
<seg id="136">In the field below you can specify a name for your geo-filter. it will then be added for later use of the list below. it works like a Live GeoFilter.</seg>
<seg id="137">& edited; provides a table in a separate window with which you can easily compare pictures. it works with all supported image file formats, including raw files.</seg>
<seg id="138">Select one or more images from any view in the main window and then use Ctrl; L The luminaire is added from the context menu. the selection will be added to the luminaire and open its window. if you are back in & edit; main window, you can quickly open the luminaire with L Extras backside.</seg>
<seg id="139">From the thumbnail, you can drag and drop the images you want to compare to the left or right part of the window. if you are looking for a preview from the toolbar, select Zoo and move operations on one of the pictures, then they are also executed in the other image. you can therefore compare the same area of the two images.</seg>
<seg id="140">Another mode is better suited to quickly select from a series of images. if you navigate pair mode from the toolbar, then the two first pictures are automatically loaded into the areas for comparisons. use the left mouse button on any preview image to display it on the left. this makes it easy to browse through a series of similar images.</seg>
<seg id="141">Of course the normal deletion actions also work directly from the light table like e.g. F4 file Edit....</seg>
<seg id="142">All picture information from the main window of the main window is available for both thumbnails in the luminaire. this makes it easy to link visual differences with exposure data.</seg>
<seg id="143">In the lower end of each area you will find a built-in panning function that you can detect on the crossed arrows. in order to swivel the visible area of the image, you need to click them and hold the & LMB; in the preview mode both images will display the same image area.</seg>
<seg id="144">The zooming works as well as in other views. simply use the zoom knob under the images or Ctrl; mouse wheel to zoom in and out. this happens in both pictures when you are in the preview mode.</seg>
<seg id="145">What is a digital inventory management - away from the modem word? digital inventory management considers every part of the process after the image has been taken up to final output and permanent storage. each of the photos records, scans or digital photos stores a form of digital inventory management. most of us do not do this in a systematic and efficient way.</seg>
<seg id="146">We give you a tool, a plan and practical tips on how to back up your pictures, find, protect and use photos again. we consider downloading, renaming, removing, converting, grouping, securing, evaluating, compiling, archiving, optimizing, waiting and exporting image files.</seg>
<seg id="147">& quot; Digital inventory management assumes, indexes, categorizes, secures, searches, transforms, confiscated and exports contents that have a monetary or cultural value.</seg>
<seg id="148">Metadata is defined as data about data. metadata is data according to your definition, providing information about or documentation of other data managed by an application or environment.</seg>
<seg id="149">If you don't even know how many photos you have, then do not use & digiplug; the approach to store the metadata both in a database and in the image files guarantees very fast searching and a secure archiving on which you can access with other programs, platforms and formats freely.</seg>
<seg id="150">The first thing you need to do and know before you integrate any information into your system is the structure of information structure in contrast to the data structure. your image files must somehow be organized on your computer. you must decide whether you want to save them to a reserved drive or on a network drive & etc; make sure that you have to switch to a larger drive someday.</seg>
<seg id="151">You may be happy with this structure. holiday pictures can be quickly found over your location unless you were in one year several times at the same location. if you make enough photos, then you will use subfolders such as & eg; 2008-01, 2008-02 & etc. export is then a folder for images you print or publish on a website.</seg>
<seg id="152">Professional photographers have different requirements such as versioning photos, archiving, work procedures, constant supply of images to different topics and a large number of all. within 10 years 95% of archives and 5% work files will have and you will not want to reorganize your structure for this content.</seg>
<seg id="153">What types of files fit together? the separation of file types makes batch processing easier. separate new from old files.</seg>
<seg id="154">The separation of original and working files simplifies a backup strategy and migration. you will always know whether you are looking for an original or a derived image.</seg>
<seg id="155">We also recommend storing metadata in & digitizing the metadata on the settings page. this ensures that EXIF and IPTC data are written into the file. if you forget this, you can subsequently save the metadata from the database into the files by selecting the appropriate item in the Album menu.</seg>
<seg id="156">Now you have a lot of information in your database, but what happens if you want to change what? to do so, & digiplug; giving them a metadata editor for a number of selected attributes. these are of course the most important ones.</seg>
<seg id="157">Now the real work begins because you should now assign keywords, labels and an evaluation to each photo. of course, you can select all the images that need the same attribute and set the value. this makes sense because you can focus on the best photos in the further work.</seg>
<seg id="158">Let's start with keywords, keywords, as you often call other programs, or Categories. all three are synonyms for the same thing.</seg>
<seg id="159">If you import catalogues from another source with embedded keywords, then & digiplug; automatically build the tree for you or insert the images to the right place. sorting the hierarchy within the tree is not a problem and can easily be done by dragging a subtree to another. the changed keywords are edited by & digiplug; updated while keeping the subtrees.</seg>
<seg id="160">The graphic shows how different metadata is overlapping. this is a very rough representation since each block of metadata consists of many sections.</seg>
<seg id="161">Enough of the keywords - the next section refers to labels or comments, the third important tool to cataloguise your metadata.</seg>
<seg id="162">Most people don't want to see your photos only, you want to share them with your friends, family, other photographers and agencies.</seg>
<seg id="163">Look at this panorama. from the distance there is not even a beautiful beach panorama. if you look at it more closely then you start to see some details, people, the place.</seg>
<seg id="164">And now I'm telling you that this is the landing place of the Allies & quot; Omaha Beachquot; in the French Normandy 60 years after landing. wow! you start to dream of associations, memories, the historical period of time is again present, you may even hear the silence.</seg>
<seg id="165">For others who look at your photos, the title is perhaps more important than the image itself to generate an interest. if you show pictures you should tell a story. remember, the key is to transmit the meaning to the viewer to help him understand what you are moving about.</seg>
<seg id="166">It is fine if an image is not perfect if it has the power only to work with a caption for itself.</seg>
<seg id="167">With & digiplug; you can save as much text, in an internationalized alphabet (UTF-8), as a label. you can even export it for a selection of images at the same time. if you export your images in web galleries, then these labels are exported to your liking and / or the title of the web gallery system.</seg>
<seg id="168">Do you remember the times before GPS? when you had to find another city without a navigation system? was it not a boring planet in front of Google Earth? well, because with pictures the train of the spatial presentation now drives with speed of light.</seg>
<seg id="169">The possibilities to take advantage of geolocation are innumerable and will become even deeper in the future. I'm sure that one day, in the near future, you can virtually recreate your trips using images with geographic data. this will also display kml files that you can open with Google Earth. you can also export the pictures to Gallery2, Picasaweb, Flickr & etc.</seg>
<seg id="170">& quot; Copyleft is a word play with copyright and denotes the practice to use copyrights to remove limitations concerning the distribution and modification of copies. the same freedoms are also valid in all changed versions, i.e. for the work of others.</seg>
<seg id="171">The following description tells you which information in the setup page of & digiplug; as information should be stored:</seg>
<seg id="172">Author (synonym for creator and author): this field should contain your name, or the name of the person who created the photo. if it is not desired to use the name of the photographer, e.g. to protect the identity of the photographer, then the name of a company or organization can't be changed. this field does not support commas or semicolons as separators.</seg>
<seg id="173">Author title: associated with the author. this field contains the working title of the photographer. examples can be as: employee photographer, freelance photographer or independent commercial photographer. since this is a note to the author field, it must be filled in as well.</seg>
<seg id="174">Publisher (synonym for suppliers): use the provider field to identify who works the photo. this does not necessarily have to be the author. if the photographer is working for a news agency such as Reuters or Associated Press, then these organizations can be listed here that you offer the image to others.</seg>
<seg id="175">It is very important to fill the author and copyright sections, even though they do not provide protection against abuse. anyone who has a little more than basic knowledge in working with computers can delete or modify these, in the image embedded metadata. for private individuals, this is only of little interest for most of your photos. for professionals and semi professionals, this protection is very important.</seg>
<seg id="176">The digital watermark is unique per image. & digiplug; will provide such a module for batch processing in the near future.</seg>
<seg id="177">Topics: plate failure, disk failure, electric shocks, ECC, transmission errors, aging of storage media, restoration, redundancy, disaster prevention, lifetime, temperature, data size, dissemination superstition</seg>
<seg id="178">Of course, we don't talk about CDs that were lost on the street or on a fire. these kinds of losses are the same that can happen to you even in traditional paper photos or negatives. in this section it is about problems with the so-called New Media.</seg>
<seg id="179">Kroll onTRACK, the world's largest data recovery company, has some interesting statistics about the reasons for data loss.</seg>
<seg id="180">To combat the problem with CDs / DVDs, those cautious will need to be treated and you may not be trusted for more than a few years. of course you can also buy CDs and DVDs in archival quality which are longer, more difficult to get and much more expensive.</seg>
<seg id="181">CD / DVD discs can be unreadable but you can reduce this risk in which you can use good disks and good recording devices and store them in the right way. the best DVD recording devices are not much more expensive than the cheapest but you write much more reliable.</seg>
<seg id="182">CDs and DVDs are very susceptible to errors even if they are just written. therefore, they use a control sum mechanism to protect themselves. therefore, 75% of the data is only effective data, the rest we need for formatting and control sums. despite this massive protection they age through chemical ageing, ultraviolet light, scratches, dust & etc.</seg>
<seg id="183">For faulty CDs and DVDs, there is a special program called IsoBuster which apparently works wonders for CDs and DVDs. it runs on Windows and Linux; but is not yet available for Macs. there are also similar applications that read damaged data from damaged disks, hard disks, flash media, USB drives etc.</seg>
<seg id="184">Optical Media: Blu-ray Disks seem to capture the format war against the HD DVD. a dual layer Blu-ray disc can store 50 GB and thus almost six times the capacity of a dual-layer DVD with 8.5 GB.</seg>
<seg id="185">Slowly burn with a good capture device to high-quality media in a non-propriate format. also read the media with a description, date & author mark and then store at a clean, dark dry and in front of animals. do not forget to copy the data to the next generation of media before you can read the last piece of hardware or software that can read these media.</seg>
<seg id="186">Your manufacturer's guarantees include a new disk, but not the data. Google provides a large field study on the fault mechanisms of hard drives on this subject.</seg>
<seg id="187">Electronic parts of the controller are the most common error reason, SMART can not detect these errors. some of SMART errors indicate the immediately pending failure. this is especially read errors and relocation meters. the expected lifetime is between 4 and 5 years.</seg>
<seg id="188">This is just the complete loss due to overvoltage. of course, you can also save data loss due to a power failure before you have secured the files, but these losses can normally be restored without major problems.</seg>
<seg id="189">While most electrical devices do not account a lot, it looks different on devices with computer chips and high-speed processes. these can cause serious damage. on your computer, these anomalies can cause serious keypads, complete data loss, hardware aging, destroyed botherboards and other defects. so protect yourself from the inevitable that leads to a loss of time and money.</seg>
<seg id="190">The most common protection against current peaks is overvoltage protection. this is a device that absorbs part of the energy heat and grounded the rest. it is usually available in the form of a connector strip. remember, however, that not every connector also contains overvoltage protection.</seg>
<seg id="191">If you are looking for overvoltage protection, you should ensure that it meets the UL 1449 standard, which guarantees a certain minimum of protection. you should also ensure that it provides protection against lightning strikes and protects the properly connected devices.</seg>
<seg id="192">Since an overvoltage can use any cable to your computer, you should make sure that all peripheral devices connected to your system are protected. this also applies to phone lines and cable modems because of this an overvoltage can also be achieved. some manufacturers provide overvoltage protection devices which also provide a telephone connection for your modem. others provide connection options for the coaxial cable of the cable modem and the TV card.</seg>
<seg id="193">If you have a notebook, you will need a portable overvoltage protection. a variety of these devices are especially designed for notebooks and therefore very small and they also contain the protection for the modem.</seg>
<seg id="194">While an overvoltage protection protects your system from minor fluctuations in the power lines, it will not really help you in case of a complete failure. even a breakdown of a few seconds can lead to the loss of irreplaceable data. it can therefore be useful to invest in an uninterruptible power supply.</seg>
<seg id="195">In addition to protecting against overvoltages, these devices can automatically provide battery energy when a power outage occurs. some models even allow them to continue working until the current runs again. if you purchase a UPS then you should be sure that they meet the same quality requirements as overvoltage protection. furthermore, the lifetime of the battery and the accompanying software is interesting.</seg>
<seg id="196">Consider the potential risk that your computer system is exposed to and compare its security with the costs of avoiding these. a high-quality overvoltage protection can cost you up to 20 euro; 20. this is only a small price difference if you consider how well your computer is using it. at the end, you should always remember all the cables before you go into the holiday.</seg>
<seg id="197">The Amazon Web Service contains S3 - Simple Storage Service - a simple storage service. with the right configuration you can install it as a drive under & Linux;, Mac, and Windows. this allows you to use it as a backup destination for your software.</seg>
<seg id="198">Compared to hard disks at home however, they are very expensive - 40 GB cost & dollars; 75 per year and 400 GB cost & dollars; 500. furthermore, you need to send the data about the comparatively slow internet.</seg>
<seg id="199">The solutions are therefore only suitable as a solution against a local data loss of the most important images. it is not a bad solution, but it is not a general securing solution.</seg>
<seg id="200">Picasaweb (Google), Flickr (Yahoo) and the photo community 23hq.com provide online storage services available on photos. your free memory is limited to 1 GB and you will not have your pictures in full resolution online.</seg>
<seg id="201">From the point of view of data backup, the web solutions are very secure. transmission errors are automatically adjusted thanks to the TCP protocol and the large companies offer a backup and distributed memory in the offer.</seg>
<seg id="202">The diagram shows the elements of the transmission chain on the computer. all transmissions are susceptible to transfer errors. the file system ZFS and btrfs at least ensure data integrity between operating system and hard drive.</seg>
<seg id="203">The worst thing about this is that no one tells you when a transmission error occurred, not when it happened in your hardware. it is quite disturbing that there should be no protection in your computer. no one seems to have thought of it. the Internet with its TCP protocol is a much more secure data path than that in your computer.</seg>
<seg id="204">Unreliable power supplies are another source of transmission losses, since they generate interferences within the data streams. in normal file systems, these errors remain unnoticed.</seg>
<seg id="205">Even if you are not particularly affected by transmission problems, you should look into the future. already in 2010 you will see thousands of errors per year.</seg>
<seg id="206">ZFS of Sun Microsystems seems to be one of two candidates who can deal with disk failures on a low level and highly scalable. it is open source, with many patents and is available under a GPL incompatible licence for Solaris and Leopard. we can only hope that it will soon also be available for Linux; and Windows. read this article in English.</seg>
<seg id="207">Oracle has started its own initiative with its btrfs file system. this is still in the alpha state. it uses the same protection mechanism the ZFS is used and is also available for & Linux; however, it is not yet part of the kernel.</seg>
<seg id="208">Do not underestimate this! these two factors are responsible for 86% of data loss in the notebook and 46% in workstation systems.</seg>
<seg id="209">Data loss due to viruses is less common than most people think. it leads to a lower damage, such as theft or new installations. and it is currently limited to Microsoft systems; Apple users only know very few viruses and under & Linux; no longer has been sighted for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="210">Open source file systems are less prone to data loss than proprietary systems: wrong, NTFS is minimal better than ext3, ReiserFS, JFS and XFS to name the most widespread file systems.</seg>
<seg id="211">Journaling file systems prevent corrupted data and data loss: wrong, only the speed of the investigation process during a sudden interruption during an operation is higher and an undefined status is avoided. however, if a file has not been completely stored before the problem occurred, it is lost.</seg>
<seg id="212">Viruses are the biggest threat to digital data: wrong, theft and human error are the main causes of data loss.</seg>
<seg id="213">Sensors of digital cameras are 1-2 aperture settings from fundamental physical limits. it is meant that while the technology develops further, there is a natural limit for this advancement. sensitivity and noise characteristics for all types of light sensors are not far from this limit.</seg>
<seg id="214">Today's cameras go in the direction of 10 megapixel numbers. even if this resolution is already too high for compact cameras and the end result is worse for compact cameras. even DSLR cameras have their limit at 10-12 megapixels. for higher resolutions, you need a full-format sensor (24x36mm) or larger formats.</seg>
<seg id="215">You get a 750GB hard drive today for 100 & euro; so don't worry anyone else for data loss. 6% of all PCs are affected by a data loss every year. so, secure your data after a plan and test this backup before you do anything dangerous such as reinstalling your operating system, the replacement of disks or the resizing of hard drives.</seg>
<seg id="216">Suppose you make your backups every day on an external SATA drive. if, then one day, a flash strikes you luck if the drive was not connected at the moment.</seg>
<seg id="217">A disaster strikes locally and destroys a lot. forget aircraft accidents: fire, water, electricity, children and theft are dangerous enough for your data.</seg>
<seg id="218">Therefore, desktop diffraction always means a not local storage. bring your backups up the stairs, into the neighbour house, into your office or similar.</seg>
<seg id="219">There is another advantage of the physical separation: as mentioned above is a common reason for a data loss despite backup the panic. if you have a backup that is not immediately available, then you can save that one day.</seg>
<seg id="220">Full backup: a complete backup of all files to backup. it is a snapshot without history and represents a complete copy at a time.</seg>
<seg id="221">Differential backup: a backup of the files that have been changed since the last complete backup. creates a complete snapshot at two times: one of the complete backup and the last differential backup.</seg>
<seg id="222">Incremental backup: a backup of the files that have been changed since the last backup. creates multiple snapshots. you can restore the original status at any time on which such a backup was made. this backup comes with a versioning system closest to the exception that it only scanned and is not ongoing.</seg>
<seg id="223">Rsync is a wonderful little tool that you can easily set up on your machines. unlike script-controlled FTP sessions or other types of file transferring scripts, rsync only copies the difference of files that were actually changed. this is compressed and if you want to increase security over ssh.</seg>
<seg id="224">Backup important images directly after you have saved them on your computer to a DVD or other optical media.</seg>
<seg id="225">This approach gives you enough time to detect and restore losses. at the same time, you come for backup but with & lt; 130% of the size of the working files. in the end, you will have a complete daily version of the last 7-14 days, a weekly snapshot for at least one month and a snapshot for each month.</seg>
<seg id="226">Topics: metadata in the image file stored IPTC information, associated XMP files, retain original memory, scalability, media, reviewing images and metadata, copying images to the next generation of media, applications, operating systems, virtualization, viewing devices,..., using the internet.</seg>
<seg id="227">So valuable pictures survive the next 40 year, that is about the period in which you really are interested in you because they remind you of your childhood or youth, there are two strategies that should be considered:</seg>
<seg id="228">As the future is unforeseeable due to your nature, you have to consider all that is being said today with caution and re-evaluate as time passes. unfortunately, there is no other way to get a certain vigilance. every 5-8 years you should ask yourself how the current system is backwards compatible. the fewer variants you have used in the past, the easier it is to evaluate the issues of the future.</seg>
<seg id="229">This question should actually be answered based on the explanations in this document. use or change to open standards supported by many applications.</seg>
<seg id="230">Virtualization is available for everyone nowadays. so if you have an old system that is important to read your images, keep it up and install it in a virtual machine for later use.</seg>
<seg id="231">On the other hand, the advice is quite simple: every time you change your computer architecture, memory and backup technology, or your file format, you should check your library and convert if necessary to a newer standard. stay with open standards.</seg>
<seg id="232">Scalability is the ability to change a system in its size. this means increasing the size of the system.</seg>
<seg id="233">Let's assume that you have planned scalability and the area you want to enlarge to a dedicated disk or partition. with * nix systems like & Linux, you can copy this area and relocate it to a new disk:</seg>
<seg id="234">Check with the dmesg command if your new plate was detected by the system, but do not append it.</seg>
<seg id="235">& dollars; dd if = / dev / sdb [#] of = / dev / sdc # source is / dev / sdc # source is / dev / sdc & dollar; parted resize / dev / sdc # source is / dev / sdc # source; resize2fs / dev / sadc1 # change the size of the file if necessary</seg>
<seg id="236">Open source standards have the great advantage of an open specification. even if there is no longer any software that can read it, you can create it yourself. this task becomes easier from year to year.</seg>
<seg id="237">GIF is a proprietary, patented format that slowly disappears from the market. it should therefore no longer be used.</seg>
<seg id="238">PNG has been developed as an open source standard that should replace GIF. it is lossless, supports XMP, Exinf and IPTC metadata, 16-bit per color channel and full transparency. PNG can store gamma- and chromaticity data for improved color assignment for heterogeneous platforms.</seg>
<seg id="239">TIFF is widely used as a picture format. TIFF can be stored in uncompressed form or in a container with a lossless compression algorithm (default). it manages images in high quality, but requires very large files. however, a problem is that this format has been adapted by many people. therefore, there are more than 50 different types and not all applications can work with all types.</seg>
<seg id="240">DNG has been developed on the TIFF / EP format and committed to using metadata. a handful of camera manufacturers already provide DNG and we hope that Canon and Nikon will use it sometime.</seg>
<seg id="241">This may be one of the reasons why in 2001, Adobe has introduced its XML-based XMP technology to replace the & quot; image resource block & quot; technology of the 1990s. it is a coding technology that allows users to embed their data into a file itself. the file information is stored with the extension & quot; .xmpquot; stored for XML / RDF.</seg>
<seg id="242">Many photographers prefer to archive it from an original recording, mostly in raw format. XMP fits this because it stores the metadata separately from the image file. however, it can cause problems when linking the metadata file and the image file, and as noted above, the raw format will be obsolete. therefore, you should consider whether you use DNG as a container and put everything there together.</seg>
<seg id="243">The Dublin Core Metadata Initiative is an open organization supporting fully compatible online metadata standards that support a wide range of applications and business models. DCMI's activities include work on architecture and modeling, discussions and collaborative work in the DCMI communities and the DCMI groups, yearly conferences and workshops, standard connections and educational efforts to achieve far-reaching acceptance of metadata standards and practices.</seg>
<seg id="244">Import images from the camera, card reader or scanner. as long as the images on the camera are edited, you can use this as a temporary backup.</seg>
<seg id="245">Convert raw files to DNG and save them in your raw archive. this feature is not yet implemented.</seg>
<seg id="246">For a fine editing, you can use external programs. if you edit the images again with & edited, then you should add the metadata again.</seg>
<seg id="247">Protect the copyrighted images for copyright using a digital watermark. export them first in web galleries, code in MPEG, use in contact sheets, print & etc;</seg>
<seg id="248">The camera interface is not the only way to get your photos in & edited; in the Adding a Photo to an Album, you will find a description of how you can add photos you already have on your hard disk. however, the camera interface provides you with many advanced settings for importing images to your database.</seg>
<seg id="249">To use your digital camera with & digiplug, connect them to the computer, turn the camera to the display mode and turn it on. another description can be found in the manual of your camera.</seg>
<seg id="250">If you start the camera interface, it tries to connect to your camera. if the connection is made, a finished indicator appears at the bottom and the thumbnails of all photos on the camera will appear. some cameras do not display thumbnails. if this is the case, the file names and a symbol for your application will be displayed on the camera for each file, photos, movies, music etc.</seg>
<seg id="251">Before you download the photos on your computer, you may need the camera information for each entry. you can view the properties of an entry or its metadata with the side rails features and metadata from the camera interface.</seg>
<seg id="252">This dialog displays file properties and photo information stored internally by the camera. a symbol indicates that the image has not yet been downloaded to your computer. note that some digital cameras do not have all the information available.</seg>
<seg id="253">The tab metadata shows the internal metadata such as Exif, manufacturer's remarks, GPS etc. of the image. this information is the same as the Metadata page strip from & digikam's main window; or image editing. note that these metadata is not available for some digital cameras.</seg>
<seg id="254">The easiest way to download photos on your computer is the click on the button Download and then download the selection of All. this invites all photos from your camera to a single album in & digicode;. when downloading the photos are not deleted and we recommend you to check if the pictures were downloaded in an album before you delete the photos from the camera.</seg>
<seg id="255">If you do not want to download all the photos, you can only select the desired with the standard selection methods of & kde; once you have selected the photos, use the Download button and then download the selected one. the selected button will be downloaded as long as you have selected some photos.</seg>
<seg id="256">If your camera supports this, a new option is available. in this case, the new images are marked with an asterisk in the preview window. if you choose this option, only the new images will be downloaded.</seg>
<seg id="257">When you use the buttons to download or download selected folders, a dialog with which you can select the target album will appear in which the photos are stored. you can read the list of existing albums, as usual folder, in the section My Albums. then select the target album from the list and press OK.</seg>
<seg id="258">After selecting the target album, press OK, and & edited; load the photos from the camera to the album.</seg>
<seg id="259">Once you have downloaded the desired photos, you can delete them from the camera. you can all delete them at once by using the Delete All button. if you want to delete only some, you have to select them first and then use Delete Selected to delete them.</seg>
<seg id="260">Note that there is no way to recover photos that you have deleted from the camera. you should therefore carefully check that the photos have been successfully downloaded into a digipate; - album downloaded before you delete them from the camera. if you want to completely delete the camera file, you should do so via the camera module, as this is much faster.</seg>
<seg id="261">The file names are normally used again after the photos are deleted from the camera. this can lead to duplicate file names, if you load photos from different recording galleries into the same album. therefore, it may be useful to integrate the date and time when the image was taken into the file name.</seg>
<seg id="262">In the next section you will find options for turning and mirroring the image and for file-based sub-albums. if you use this latter option, a folder will be created automatically per day.</seg>
<seg id="263">The options During the transfer will open three more options that will be executed before the photos are stored on the disk. the first two relate the data about the author in the section Standard Autoidentity. if you select this, the corresponding entries will be copied from the exif information into the IPTC fields. with the last option, you can correct date & time for all downloaded images.</seg>
<seg id="264">For example, if you want a different date format than the default format, you can use the prefix photo-% Y-% m-% d% H:% M:% S. turn on the date & time option. for further adjustments, you should read the command strftime.</seg>
<seg id="265">If you use the option camera filename, you have the option to change the file names in lowercase. or in uppercase, if you prefer this.</seg>
<seg id="266">The new filename, the & edited; for a photo, is displayed below the name that the camera provides in the preview. your settings for renaming will be saved and used automatically when you open the camera window next time.</seg>
<seg id="267">& edited; can use all the information about the orientation of the camera at the time point of recording to perform an automatic turn during shutdown. not all cameras provide this information. in the Metadata section, you can read more details about the information that your camera embedded in the photo.</seg>
<seg id="268">The automatic turn is usually switched on, and if your camera doesn't deliver this information, it lets & edit; the photo in original orientation. if you want to turn off the automatic turn, use the Advanced button and select the automatic turning in the bottom of the window.</seg>
<seg id="269">If your camera provides information about the date on which the photo was taken, it can be used to automatically create sub-albums in the target album. all images with the same date are loaded into the same sub-album. not all cameras provide this information. in the Meta data section, you can read what information your camera could have embedded in the photos.</seg>
<seg id="270">This option is normally switched off, and digitized in this case; the photos directly in the target album. if you want to change this, you need to turn this option on. use the Advanced button and select the date-based bottom bar at the bottom of the window.</seg>
<seg id="271">The easiest way to load photos from your computer to your camera is the download button. then select uploading. the file selection dialog & kde; appears where you can select the files to be uploaded. you can also select more than one file with the default & kde; methods.</seg>
<seg id="272">After the image selector has been completed, it asks & edited; you where the images should be uploaded. a folder selection dialog appears for the camera. select the folder you want and press OK to start the upload. the images will not be deleted from your computer.</seg>
<seg id="273">GPS (Global Positioning System) is used as a general term in this document. this refers to a position indicated in longitude and latitude and which can be displayed on a map. the data can be determined by the American GPS, the Russian GLONAS, the European GALILEO or any other system.</seg>
<seg id="274">Not only for professional photographers, it can be interesting to link an image with a precise geographical location. not everyone uses a plane to map an area by automatic recording of the GPS data. environmental planners, military, police, architecture offices and real estate agents can use this ability.</seg>
<seg id="275">If you have forgotten where exactly the photo was taken, you can open a browser that displays the area. if you want to send a postcard to another & digiplug; users who want to locate the location of the photo, or just want to document that aspect, it is good to save the position data of a photo.</seg>
<seg id="276">The question is how does the GPS data come into the picture? first, you should know that there are many GPS data fields, such as direction, semitrailings and map references. the question is actually more about how the data come into these fields? there are at least three ways to achieve this. directly with the right hardware, via post-processing of GPS data and image files with the KIPI module for geographical allocation (handbook) and last on manual input of known places.</seg>
<seg id="277">As far as we know, there is currently no camera that has integrated a GPS unit. but there are a few that work together with GPS receivers. either as a map module or by transmitting data with a cable or Bluetooth.</seg>
<seg id="278">Cameras with GPS interface: CoyoteEye iPAQ Ike Kodak DCS Pro Nikon DSLR Ricoh Pro G3 Sony</seg>
<seg id="279">Downloading GPS data from one device can be done with gpsman or gpsbabel. however, you need to save these data in GPX format, as this is the only format supported by the geographical mapping module.</seg>
<seg id="280">There are various programs for & Windows; and Mac OS that can extract and correlate the data of images and the GPS. on the following page you can do the same on & Linux; gpsCorr or gpsPhoto</seg>
<seg id="281">If you know the longitude and latitude or other data then you can use this script that works with the ExifTool by Phil Harvey. it uses the accidentals of hairpin coordinates created e.g. maps.google.</seg>
<seg id="282">Maps.google.com shows no European street maps. here are some European sites, at least in French, German and Spanish, which show all navigation details for Europe.</seg>
<seg id="283">& digiplug; tries to give you as much control over your workflow as possible. there are many settings that change the behavior of & edited. to access these settings, you need to select Edit Details. the settings dialog is divided into eight pages. you can switch between them by clicking on the icons on the left.</seg>
<seg id="284">Select action can be displayed on a saved preview or image editing will be set. you will then set the default behavior of & digiplug; specify when you click on an entry in the main view.</seg>
<seg id="285">This page contains, as shown below, the standardization and copyright data. this data is automatically written into the corresponding IPTC data fields if the option was selected when downloading from the camera interface. also with a database synchronization, these data are written into the IPTC fields.</seg>
<seg id="286">Author title is a synonym for command line: this field should contain the professional name of the photographer. this can be designations such as the photographer, freelance photographer or independent, commercial photographer. since this is a more detailed description of the author field, it must also be filled.</seg>
<seg id="287">Publisher is a synonym for providers: use this field to specify the image that the photo offers. this does not have to be the author if it works for a news agency such as Reuters or Associated Press, then these organizations should be listed here since this picture is a stock photo, then the group or agency that provides the image will be listed here.</seg>
<seg id="288">The IPTC actions store the data in the appropriate IPTC rims. this ensures that the metadata is permanently contained in the image and not only in the & digiplug database; this metadata is also available to other programs and can be imported into & digiplug; imported without being lost.</seg>
<seg id="289">Captions as embedded inscriptions (JFIF) in JPEG images: this synchronizes the comments you add to your photos with the captions embedded in the images. this allows your captions to be read from other image viewers.</seg>
<seg id="290">The Settings page contains all the information that appears when the mouse cursor is in the main window over a file. depending on the selected option, this information is displayed or not.</seg>
<seg id="291">& # 160; edited; supports a number of different image formats and some video and audio formats. to specify which file types & digicode; to view, you can add and remove the file extensions of this list.</seg>
<seg id="292">The default settings can be reset by pressing the Update button on the right of each category.</seg>
<seg id="293">Each time you open the beacon, these settings are turned on. however, some pictures have different sizes and the synchronous mode is not available. the option & quot; In the whole image size, you can only use on fast hosts. if you have one, then you can get better viewing results.</seg>
<seg id="294">By default, the image processing uses a black background behind the displayed photos. if you prefer a different color, you can select it here. you can turn off the toolbar if you use the image editing in full screen mode.</seg>
<seg id="295">Over- and underexposed areas of an image can be marked with dark or light color in the picture. these colors are specified here. in the image processing, this View Mode can be switched on and off with F10 and F11.</seg>
<seg id="296">With Chroma subsampling it is meant that the images are encoded in a higher resolution of the luminance than in the color information. please read this article in Wikipedia for more detailed explanation.</seg>
<seg id="297">With the PNG image setting, you can reduce the size of PNG files. this operation does not reduce the image quality since PNG is using a lossless algorithm. if you have a fast machine, you can set this value to high compression.</seg>
<seg id="298">With the TIFF file compression you can turn off the default compression algorithm for TIFF images. this reduces the size of TIFF images. it does not affect the image quality since the default algorithm works lossless.</seg>
<seg id="299">With the setting of lossless JPEG 2000 files, you can save lossless. even if you select the lossy setting, the relationship between quality loss and file size is far better than normal JPEG. as this paragraph has been written, metadata has not been supported yet, but was in the planning.</seg>
<seg id="300">In previous versions of & digikam, image editing was only a picture viewer for photos. currently, it is very fast becoming a tool for manipulating your photos. with this dialog you can change the image editing settings.</seg>
<seg id="301">The standard feature is that all green pixels are the same. if the linear green pixels of the CCD sensor react more sensitive to ultraviolet light than the pixels with odd lines, this difference produces a grid pattern in the output. this option marks the image a little soft, but eliminates the 2x2 grid pattern with the VNG- or AHD quality method.</seg>
<seg id="302">If this option is set, the white balance of the camera is used. otherwise, if set, the auto color balance is used.</seg>
<seg id="303">This setting is only used when the white balance is not set. standard is a fixed color balance based on a white card that was photographed in the sunlight.</seg>
<seg id="304">This setting is supported only for Fuji Super CCD SLR cameras. using the second sensors has the effect that underexposed images in four steps get more details in the top lights. for other cameras this option is ignored.</seg>
<seg id="305">The default is the highlights, so the parts of your images that are burned, because of the inability of your camera to capture the pointed-out white in the settings. the setting colors will create some unusual results as it shows the highlights in various rosettes. last, you can attempt to construct some parts of the missing information from the peak lights to reconstruct.</seg>
<seg id="306">This is possible because blue pixels in general are not as fast enough as green and red. & digiplug; and dcraw therefore try to reconstruct the missing green and red parts from the still not saturated blue pixels. of course, this is a question of how much color or white you want.</seg>
<seg id="307">If you select the option Reconstructing, you get the possibility to set a level. here, a value of three is a compromise and / should therefore be individually adapted for each image.</seg>
<seg id="308">Set the luminance value according to your taste. you probably have to set it slightly higher than standard 1. however, this can be done later in the image options of the & digiplug; image processing. in order to keep the time for the demosaicing small, you should proceed conservatively.</seg>
<seg id="309">A Demosaicing algorithm is a digital image process to calculate a complete image from the sub-raw data that come from the color-filtered image sensor that many cameras have and which provides a matrix of colored pixels. this algorithm is also known as CFA interpolation or color rendering.</seg>
<seg id="310">& digiplug; and Dcraw provide you three alternatives: bilinear, VNG Interpolation and AHD Interpolation. after some tests it looks as if AHD Interpolation (for Adaptive Homogenesis Directed) was the first algorithm used by Dcraw. however, it creates color artefacts on the edges.</seg>
<seg id="311">If you know the color deviation of your lenses, you can set the red and blue corrections here. this is certainly the best method for color softening as it is carried out during the rough conversion.</seg>
<seg id="312">A profile translates the color information and gives instructions how to get it back. there are also LCMS and & digikam; information such as the color information from a color space in the others are to translate the colors as precisely as possible.</seg>
<seg id="313">Behavior Questions when an image is opened in image processing / color management module starts with raw files.</seg>
<seg id="314">Color Profile folder Set the folder, such as / usr / share / color / ICC or / home / user / .color / ICC, where you save all your profiles. & digiplug; examine this folder then during startup.</seg>
<seg id="315">Settings of the ICC profiles you have here the possibility & quot; default squot; to leave for your profiles. everything can be changed later when opening the raw file.</seg>
<seg id="316">The color management view is an alternative to Xcalib or Argyll. here are just your pictures color-managed not the entire screen.</seg>
<seg id="317">The input profiles should fit to the camera manufacturer and model you use. not all profiles are created in the same way. there are some, e.g. Canon, which do not contain color-mapping or gamma correction. currently, dwindw gamma does not correct conversions at 16 bit depth. this means that you have to carry out the color mapping itself.</seg>
<seg id="318">There are other options like the Soft-Proof profile that you can emulate on how to print your picture from one device. this is very useful before you print image as your printer may have a smaller color range than your camera and some colors may be very saturated. this could be corrected manually instead of relying on the blind algorithm of your printer.</seg>
<seg id="319">For most cameras it is quite obvious which color profile is intended for. unfortunately not on the models of Canon. therefore, here is a table of cameras and profiles that match together. this answer is naturally inofficial:</seg>
<seg id="320">The Canon profile extension lets you recognize the style for the destination: F for a precise style, L for landscapes, N for Neutral, P for portrait and S for the standard style.</seg>
<seg id="321">KIPI is the & kde; image plugin interface. it is an interface that is supported by a number of & kde; image viewer and image editing. by deploying this interface, & digiplug can support many modules that have been written to work with any program that supports the KIPI interface.</seg>
<seg id="322">If your distribution has the KIPI modules installed, you will see a list of available modules. select the modules you want to use, and these are then loaded by & digiplug; these modules appear as new entries in the main window menu and in addition, you will also find some in the context menu of the previews.</seg>
<seg id="323">Short commands for tasks performed by modules can be set in the menu under Settings short commands.</seg>
<seg id="324">More information (in English) about KIPI modules can be obtained via the KIPI project under http: / / www.kipi-plugins.org or in the manuals of the KIPI modules.</seg>
<seg id="325">The slider settings should be easy to understand. the upper knob adjusts the time between the picture transitions, normally 4-5 seconds are good. the other check boxes turn the metadata on or off, which are displayed at the bottom of the pictures during the ad.</seg>
<seg id="326">The camera features on the left hand show a list of all currently supported cameras. on the right side there is a button Automatic Detection, which tries to identify a camera connected to the computer. if you want to use this, make sure the camera is properly connected, switched on and in the image display mode. currently, serial, USB and USB / FireWire mass storage are supported.</seg>
<seg id="327">At the bottom, you can set the path for USB and FireWire (IEEE-1394 or i-Link) mass storage cameras. this field is only active when you have selected a USB or FireWire mass storage camera from the camera list. you must specify the path, / mnt / camera or / mnt / Removable, where you can mount your camera.</seg>
<seg id="328">To use your digital camera with & digiplug, you need to connect the camera to your computer, bring it to the display mode and turn it on.</seg>
<seg id="329">Check if & edited; the camera automatically detects. if not, you can set camera models and port manually. after you have set up your camera, your camera will appear in the camera's menu.</seg>
<seg id="330">You can select any name for your camera. it will be displayed in the Cameras of the main window. if you have more than one camera, you can paste them here.</seg>
<seg id="331">With the confirmation dialog for moving &gt; Images in the MÃ¼lleimer, you can specify the dialog of & digiplug; when deleting a photo in an album, you can find more details in deleting a photo and deleting an album.</seg>
<seg id="332">Editorial changes through the right sidebar can be tacitly deleted by & edited; if you use the option changes in the right sidebar without requestioning, otherwise you will need to save the changes using the button changes.</seg>
<seg id="333">You can also display the & digiplug greeting image display; disable when starting. this might accelerate the start-up of & digitizing;.</seg>
<seg id="334">The setting When starting after new photos compels & edited; to search the base folder for new or deleted albums / photos. this extends the start time of & digitizing; if something was deleted from the base folder, it asks & edited; you, whether it should delete them from the database.</seg>
<seg id="335">Various color schemes can be edited in & edited, to customize the main window to your taste. these settings can be selected under Settings Design from the toolbar. previewing the available designs is listed below:</seg>
<seg id="336">These designs have been defined in simple text files. if you are interested in creating a new design for & digikam, you will find more information about this in this tutorial.</seg>
<seg id="337">& edited; contains a fast image processing with some basic tools. you can use them to view your photos and for correction and improvement. image editing can be started by clicking with the left mouse button on the preview of an image or through the context menu of the preview and selection of the ad / editing.</seg>
<seg id="338">The image processing contains a number of tools to improve your images. some of them are available as modules in & digiplug; therefore, they may not be part of your distribution. for more information on the KIPI modules, see the Image Processing section.</seg>
<seg id="339">A status line at the bottom of the window, the file name, current file number, magnifying factor, and the current image size.</seg>
<seg id="340">A menu bar at the top and below is the toolbar for quick access to the most frequently required functions.</seg>
<seg id="341">The editing functions of the image processing change your photos. however, none of the features will change the original photo before using File Save or the Save button from the toolbar. note that you cannot recover the original photo once you have saved the image.</seg>
<seg id="342">So you should possibly make a copy of your image before you change it. you can do this with File Save as.</seg>
<seg id="343">As long as you have not saved the photo, you can restore the original image by using the Restore button from the File menu or using the button The button Restore the Image Processing Recover in the toolbar. you then lose any change you've done in the photo since the last saving.</seg>
<seg id="344">Almost any image processing action can be undone or recovered. you can undo the last action by selecting Edit or Restore by selecting Edit from the menu.</seg>
<seg id="345">If you use this frequently, you should remember the keyboard shortcut, Ctrl; -Z to undo and remember Ctrl; Shift-Z to restore.</seg>
<seg id="346">If you press the & LMB for a moment, you will receive a context menu. if you select one of the menu entries, all actions in between will also be reversed or restored.</seg>
<seg id="347">Once you have started the image processing, you can move between the photos in the same album or the same keyword by using the navigation buttons in the toolbar, image up, picture, or the entries in the File menu. if you have made changes to the current photo, you'll be asked if you want to save them.</seg>
<seg id="348">You can enter the picture and zoom out in which you use Ctrl; mouse wheel or the symbols in the toolbar or the entries in the check menu.</seg>
<seg id="349">To adjust a photo to the window size, you can use this button in the toolbar: select magnifying factor automatically</seg>
<seg id="350">View Full Screen mode displays the picture in full screen mode. you will see the normal view where you can use the Esc key. if you do not wish to do so, you can change it in the Edit & Edit Settings dialog.</seg>
<seg id="351">If you want to print the current image, you can print the image in the File menu and get the default & kde; print dialog. you can adjust the settings here before you print your photo.</seg>
<seg id="352">From the main menu you can print individual images or whole sentences. you only need to print the images with the standard methods and select from the menu Album Export Print Assistant. if you follow the wizard, you just need to make your choice.</seg>
<seg id="353">The & digiplug; main window has a side bar on the right that provides important information and actions for the selected images. the same page strip is available without the navigation arrows, even in image editing. it is displayed when one of the five tabs is clicked:</seg>
<seg id="354">Multiple Click on the same tab leaves the page bar to appear or disappear into the margins again.</seg>
<seg id="355">The text is UTF-8 compatible, which means that all special characters are allowed. captions are copied to the EXIF and IPTC- fields so that you can be used by other programs.</seg>
<seg id="356">The IPTC data only supports ASCII characters and is limited to 2000 characters. all comments are truncated after 2000 characters and special characters are converted. if you want to use the IPTC labelling field in other applications, you should consider these limitations.</seg>
<seg id="357">After you have commented it, use either the user button or simply change to the next image, the captions will then be saved.</seg>
<seg id="358">In addition to the application button, there is a button More. with this you can read more metadata from the selected file or database. however, you can also write the metadata into the files. however, this is always done when you have chosen a metadata setting that is always written in the images.</seg>
<seg id="359">The rating shows a rating scheme from 0 to 5 stars and can be used in search and sorting. it can be applied either with a single mouse-click on the 5 stars in the sidebar or with the keyboard shortcut Ctrl + 0... 5. to evaluate multiple images simultaneously, select them and use the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="360">The evaluation is written into the IPTC field Urgency. the coding follows the scheme in the following table:</seg>
<seg id="361">The keyword list shows a search box to filter the keywords, the keyword tree and a drop-down box with the keywords used previously in this page.</seg>
<seg id="362">The keyword tree is dynamically adjusted to the entered search word. you can restrict the number of options in search of a keyword quickly. this ability is particularly useful when you have many keywords.</seg>
<seg id="363">The input field at the bottom end is a further relief when entering keywords for a picture series. if you have entered different keywords, they are saved for quick access.</seg>
<seg id="364">Keywords can also be set by selecting the appropriate check boxes in the tree. all keywords of an image are stored in the keyword IPTC.</seg>
<seg id="365">If you select multiple images in the main view and you select a keyword in the keyword tree, it will only be applied to the highlighted image and not to the entire range. if you want to add a keyword, please read the keyword filter section.</seg>
<seg id="366">The keyword filter page is used to change the selection of images displayed in the main window. normally, the left side bar is used with their Album, - date, keyword and search views. if additionally one or more keyword filters are used on the right, only the intersection of these two is displayed.</seg>
<seg id="367">You can also drag and drop tags. suppose you have selected multiple images in the main view to provide you with keywords. if the keyword already exists, you can simply drag it from the right side bar and put it on the selection.</seg>
<seg id="368">In the upper example, the main window displays the images on a calendar day. the keyword filter is set on no keywords, which reduces the amount to three images. you have been selected using Ctrl + a, and afterwards a keyword has been drawn from the right keyword tree to the selection and stored there. a dialog asks if this keyword is to be set.</seg>
<seg id="369">This search for changes takes place at any start of the program. it can also be switched off under Settings Variety.</seg>
<seg id="370">If you have created and created a rule and notice that it should be one or more, you can easily change this by double-clicking on the text and in the control area.</seg>
<seg id="371">(1): the entry after which is searched in the database. this can be an album, name, keyword, image, keyword, etc.</seg>
<seg id="372">(3): the argument for the operator which is a name or string that is already set in the database.</seg>
<seg id="373">For example, you can specify an Advanced search for all elements of the database using the following options:</seg>
<seg id="374">If you want to group options, just use the check box at the end of the rule and then use the Group button. the options then look like this:</seg>
<seg id="375">Why have Picasaweb and Flickr not listed? the free disk space is limited to 1GB and you will not want to save the images in full resolution.</seg>
<seg id="376">This article / tutorial was mainly written by Elle Stone. special thanks to Elle for this work. I mainly adapted it to & edited; s specific implementation.</seg>
<seg id="377">The reason why you use a color management workflow is that the colors that come from your camera or scanner will have a predictable deviation from the actually photographed or scanned colors. with a color management workflow you can achieve that the colors on your monitor correspond to those of your camera or scanner and that match the colors you print or publish in the web to those from your digital darkroom.</seg>
<seg id="378">When the theme comes to color management, everyone wants to know which buttons he has to press for the results he wants. unfortunately, color management means that you make informed decisions at every point of the image processing workflows. in addition, you should provide you with sufficient background information about color management. in addition, you should make links with deeper information to make your own informed decisions so that you get the desired result.</seg>
<seg id="379">If your image workflow matches all six criteria listed below, you don't have to worry about color management.</seg>
<seg id="380">You work on a monitor that is calibrated to the sRGB colour space. (see below for more information)</seg>
<seg id="381">Their only other image editions are by e-mail or the web, where sRGB is the de facto standard.</seg>
<seg id="382">So if sRGB is working so well and makes life for everyone so easy, why should one use another color space and thus have to think about color management?</seg>
<seg id="383">A visual example of the limitation of sRGB compared to the colors we can really see is presented below. it shows a 2-dimensional representation of all colors we can see, the horseshoe region, and the colors in sRGB colour space, the triangular region.</seg>
<seg id="384">If you want to compare the 2-dimensional representation of sRGB with some bigger color spaces, you can visit Bruce Lindblooms's excellent site and click Info and then on Information About RGB Working Spaces.</seg>
<seg id="385">Do I have to chart my monitor when I decided to work only in sRGB colour space?</seg>
<seg id="386">Yes! whether you work in the sRGB colour space or not, you have to chart your monitor, since sRGB assumes that your monitor is sRGB. if you work as a sRGB colour space, you either need to chart your monitor on the sRGB standard, use a suitable monitor profile or both.</seg>

<seg id="388">This tool provides five automatic corrections, which can improve a picture in most cases. therefore, use it before attempting any further manual processing.</seg>
<seg id="389">The functions Normalization, Balance, Automatic balance and Contrast extend from the Correcting Automatic correcting attempt automatic from your colors to make the best. you will need to experiment with these effects to see which works best with your photo.</seg>
<seg id="390">Normalize: this method scales the luminance values over the entire image so that the darkest point is black and the brightest point is as bright as possible without changing its color shade. this function is often a magic correction for images that are dark or washed out.</seg>
<seg id="391">Balance: this method adjusts the light intensity factor of the colors of the selected image, so that the histogram of the intensity channel is as flat as possible. sometimes the same produces very good results when improving the contrast of an image, sometimes it produces only rubbish. it is a very powerful operation that causes miracles in a picture or destroys it.</seg>
<seg id="392">Automatic adjustment: this method maximizes the colour range in the red, green and blue channel. it detects the dark and light border tones and adjusts the red, green and blue channels to the entire histogram area.</seg>
<seg id="393">Contrast: this method improves the contrast and brightness of the RGB values of an image by shifting the lowest and highest values to the highest possible range and a new jib of all values in between. this is only visible in washed pictures and can be a good correction for bad photos.</seg>
<seg id="394">The white balance of & digikam; is a semi-automatic tool to carry out the white balance of a photo.</seg>
<seg id="395">The white balance correction is a bit limited since it is used over a color space with 8-bit per color. if you are too far from the original image, areas with overexposure can occur. if you can perform the white balance in the blank mode, which works in 16-bit mode, then your possibilities for correction will be better.</seg>
<seg id="396">This tool is based on a white balance algorithm protected by Pawel T. Jochym. they start it using the menu entry colors white balance of image processing.</seg>
<seg id="397">The preview window can be adjusted in size. on the left side you can see both the original image and the preview of the target image. the preview will dynamically adjust the settings of the tool. if you want to see the original white balance again, it is enough to click on the subwindow.</seg>
<seg id="398">The preview of the target image has a red marker. the luminance of the pixel under this constraint is shown as a vertical line in the histogram.</seg>
<seg id="399">On the right side you see a histogram that changes dynamically as soon as you change a parameter. this histogram is very helpful, even in well lit images, most pixels have very small luminance values. with one button you can decide whether one of the three colors or your sum is displayed. the sum is called Luminance.</seg>
<seg id="400">The contrast of your result depends on shadow, saturation and gamma. the shadow alignment allows you to improve or dimming the shadow details of your photos.</seg>
<seg id="401">To play Anstat with the above controls, you should use the color temperature pipette. press this button and then somewhere on the image preview to use the selected color for calculating the color temperature of the white balance. in this way, also the temperature and green values are set automatically.</seg>
<seg id="402">In addition, you can set the white balance with the list of presets. the following settings are available:</seg>
<seg id="403">The overexposure indicator increases the colors when more than one color channel of the pixel is overexposed. you will see the combined result in white balance. this is shown in the preview as a pure indicator and has no effect on the final image.</seg>
<seg id="404">The buttons save as and load do exactly this. each setting of the white balance you have set you can save it into a text file and load it later.</seg>
<seg id="405">The Preferences Button resets all filter values to their default values and the associated neutral white balance. note that neutral settings will result in a different picture than your original. if you save this, your original image will be changed.</seg>
<seg id="406">You can set the encoding depth per color channel of the edited image here. 8-bit encoding is the widely used JPEG format, 16-bit encoding is better suited for high quality pictures. however, this encoding also requires more disk space, computing time and is only available for formats PNG, PNM, TIFF and DNG.</seg>
<seg id="407">This tool opens the same dialog as the editing of raw images. it uses the change and assignment of color profiles. color mapping can be done by the subwindow for the brightness. a detailed guide for using color profiles allows you to consult the chapter color management.</seg>
<seg id="408">Another important tool is to find color correction in the menu. this tool provides an integrated way to adjust several color channels at the same time, so that you can use them for several photos. this is helpful if your camera or scanner will always make the same error and you will always need the same correction.</seg>
<seg id="409">A very powerful way to correct exposure problems is the tool for gradation that you can find under Colors Gradation in the menu.</seg>
<seg id="410">The & digiplug; tool colour effects provide you with four color effects, a solar heating effect, a Velvia filter, a neon effect and a corner filter.</seg>
<seg id="411">In times of the chemical processing, Solarisation, also called Sabatier, was created when a partially developed pressure was replaced with a short flash light and then completed the development of the image. this had the effect that the lighter areas darker and the colors were inverted by the second illumination. this was a partial negatively of the image. this tool allows you to adjust this interesting effect fine.</seg>
<seg id="412">The intensity controls the solar process. at approx. 50% intensity, the picture shows what is chemically feasible.</seg>
<seg id="413">This is an example of the solar isation effect. the original image is the (1) and that processes the (2). the applied intensity is 30%.</seg>
<seg id="414">The vivid filter simulates the so-called & quot; Velviaquot; effect. it differs from a saturation by having a stronger contrast effect that makes the colors brilliant and glowing. try it easy, it beautifies many photos.</seg>
<seg id="415">Velvia is the brand name for a recycled colour film produced by the Japanese company Fujifilm. the name is a composition of & quot; Velvet Mediaquot; and thus a reference for its smooth image structure. Velvia offers very saturated colours in daylight and high contrasts.</seg>
<seg id="416">The neon filter simulates neon light on the contrast edges. the Level controls the brightness of the result and the slider repetition the strength of the neon light. in case of large pictures, the filter can load the entire CPU for a moment.</seg>
<seg id="417">Digital cameras often have problems with light conditions and it is therefore not unusual to correct the color contrast and brightness of the photos. you can also experiment with the various color schemes of your photos with the tools in the menu under colors. all your adjustments can be viewed in the preview. once you are satisfied with the result, use the Ok button and you will be applied.</seg>
<seg id="418">If you take a photo in poor lighting conditions, you can get the reverse issue: a too big saturation. also in this case the tool for brightness / saturation is a good choice to reduce saturation instead of raising it. if you like the result you can confirm the changes with Ok.</seg>
<seg id="419">Between the complex mould gradation and the simple luminosity / contrast / gamma, the tool is located to improve exposure. even if the dialogue with this tool works very complicated, you need only the range of the sliders described here. more concrete the three sliders below the histogram.</seg>
<seg id="420">The window contains a graph of intensity values, a histogram, the active channel or the selected area. under the graph, three sliders are clicked into in and those can be moved to change the intensity values of the image. the left side represents the dark and the right side the bright areas.</seg>
<seg id="421">The easiest way to learn how to operate it is to shift the controls and to pay attention to how the image changes.</seg>
<seg id="422">On the right side you can view the original and preview the image. the preview will be updated dynamically based on the settings of the image. on the left, the following options are available.</seg>
<seg id="423">Scaling: with this selection box can be set whether the histogram is represented with a linear or logarithmic Y axis. for images of a digital camera, linear representation is most useful. in images the large areas of a constant color are dominated by a linear histogram of a single column. in this case, logarithmic distribution is more useful.</seg>
<seg id="424">Three controls: the top for the dark tones, the middle for the light tones and the lowest for the middle tones, often called gamma values.</seg>
<seg id="425">The three color pipettes can be used in the preview of the original image to automatically adjust the input of shadows, middle and bright tones. furthermore, there is a button for a fully automatic adjustment.</seg>
<seg id="426">Output: the output values allow the selection of manual values for each area. there are also two controllers that can be used to change the output values interactively as with the input values. for example, the compression of the output value can be used to create a faded image as background while something else is in the foreground.</seg>
<seg id="427">Automatically: with this button, the image values are automatically set depending on the intensity values of the image.</seg>
<seg id="428">Save as and Load: with these buttons the set values can be saved in the file system and reloaded later. for this purpose, the Gimp Level format is used.</seg>
<seg id="429">If you use this mode and the three color pipettes, the input value is automatically adjusted for all shadows, means and sun shades. select the color pipette you want to use and click on the preview of the original image to set the input values of the history program for red, green, blue and the luminance channels.</seg>
<seg id="430">The option overexposure indicator controls all color channels to find overexposed pixel and show you the combined result of all channels. this is an indicator, i.e. you get the effect only shown in the preview and there is no effect to see the final result.</seg>
<seg id="431">Below you see an example of adjusting the input values applied to the red, green and blue channel of a photo. intensity and alpha channel, as well as the output values are unchanged. the original image is marked with (1) and the corrected picture with (2).</seg>
<seg id="432">On the left hand side, half of the original and the target image are displayed. the preview will be dynamically updated depending on your settings. on the right, the following options are available:</seg>
<seg id="433">Modifier channel: this box allows the channel to be specified by the module:</seg>
<seg id="434">In addition to this box, there are two symbols to switch between a linear and a logarithmic view. for images taken with a digital camera, the linear mode is the most meaningful one. for images with large areas of constant color, linear mode creates a wide beam. in this case, logarithmic mode helps.</seg>
<seg id="435">For example, if you move a part of the curve to the right, e.g. the bright tones, you can see that these bright tones correspond to darker output tones and that the corresponding pixels become darker.</seg>
<seg id="436">When you move this marker to the area you want to change, a matching line is displayed on the curve representing the original value. create a point on this line and then move it up and down until the value is adjusted according to your taste.</seg>
<seg id="437">Save as and Load: with these buttons you can do exactly this. each curve you have created can be saved in the file system and loaded later. the file format for this is the Gimp cam format.</seg>
<seg id="438">When you create this method and the three color pipettes automatically create the control points of the curve for all channels of shadow, middle and solar tones. activate the color pipette you want to use and click on the original image to set the control points for the red, green, blue and luminance curve.</seg>
<seg id="439">The Overexposure indikator option controls all color channels to display overexposed pixel. if pixels are found in more than one channel, you get the combined result. this is an indicator, i.e. you get the effect only shown in the preview and there is no effect to see the final result.</seg>
<seg id="440">Below you can see a black and white photo, which was corrected in the Luminance channel. shadow and sun shades were set with the color pipette and applied to the curves. the original image is (1) and the corrected (2).</seg>
<seg id="441">The channel mixer of the & digiplug; image processing is a tool to improve the color channels or change the color gradations of the photos.</seg>
<seg id="442">The channel mixer is another advanced tool to mix the colours of the images. you can edit it from the menu Color Channel Mixer of the image processing.</seg>
<seg id="443">With the channel selection box you can select the color for the histogram: this gives you a first indication as to how you can correct the channels by viewing the relative distribution and precipitation. the left area of the window will show you a preview. the original can be viewed for comparison with one's rider.</seg>
<seg id="444">The preview of the target image has a red marker. if you position it in the image, a vertical line in the histogram appears to show you the corresponding color value.</seg>
<seg id="445">The controls for the module are right down: controls for red, green and construction allow you to mix these channels. if you activate luminance, the image will retain the general brightness as well, as the channel mixer is then THE tool for generating great black-white conversions of your photos. try to reduce the green channel for black and white portraits.</seg>
<seg id="446">Sometimes, especially if you mix monochrome, the reduction of a color leads to a visible noise that comes from the colored. the color-brow consists of small room artefacts that do not appear at the same place in the color channel and whose noise pattern in each channel looks different. if that's the case, you can improve your monochrome conversion by doing the color-brow first.</seg>
<seg id="447">Save as and load buttons are used exactly for this purpose. you can save any mixer settings for later and then load. the file format used is the Gimp channel mixer format.</seg>
<seg id="448">The option overexposure indicator controls all color channels to find overexposed pixel and show you the combined result of all channels. this is an indicator, i.e. you get the effect only shown in the preview and there is no effect to see the final result.</seg>
<seg id="449">Below you can see a picture in which the blue channel was newly adjusted. the option Luminance Store is enabled. the original image is under (1) and the processed image under (2) to be seen.</seg>
<seg id="450">Black / white photography was always fascinating because of its ability to abstract. with the development of digital photography, black / white is a work step because color images can easily be converted to the computer. also with a set of film roll profiles.</seg>
<seg id="451">Ilford Delta 100, Ilford Delta 400, Ilford Delta 400 Pro 3200, Ilford FP4 Plus, Ilford HP5 Plus, Ilford PanF Plus, Ilford XP2 Super</seg>
<seg id="452">Green filter: simulates a black / white film exposure with a green lens filter. this looks good, with all scene images and fits especially well to portraits against the sky. so similar to the 004 Cokin (tm) green filter.</seg>
<seg id="453">Orange filter: simulates a black / white film exposure with orange lentil filter. this improves landscapes, maritime scenes and aerial photos.</seg>
<seg id="454">Red filter: simulates a black / white film exposure with a red lens filter. this creates dramatic celestial effects and can simulate lunar scenes at the time of the day. similar to the 003 Cokin (tm) red filter.</seg>
<seg id="455">Yellow filter: simulates a black / white film exposure with a yellow lens filter. this is the most natural color correction and improves the contrast. it is ideal for landscapes and therefore similar to 001 Cokin (tm) yellow filter.</seg>
<seg id="456">Santaton: produces warm light and middle tones as it adds a bit cold in the shading tones. this is very similar to the process of bleating a pressure and the redevelopment in a sepiatonic. this is typical for the photos of your grandmother and thus similar to 005 cokine (tm) seepiafilter.</seg>
<seg id="457">Using the & digiplug; apply tool texture to apply decorative textures to a picture.</seg>
<seg id="458">By adding a texture to your image, regardless of whether it is a color image or not, you can look it like an oil painting on a canvas, the stitch of an old master, a pop art portrait made of enlarged points or like a mural on a wall.</seg>
<seg id="459">Relief: shift this parameter to the right increases the appearance of depth or three-dimensionality of the texture on the picture.</seg>
<seg id="460">A paper text effect has been applied in the photo below. the original image is (1) and the changed under (2) to be seen. the parameter relief has been set to 200.</seg>
<seg id="461">With the & digiplug; tool frame add can be added a decorative frame around a picture.</seg>
<seg id="462">Keeping the eye of a viewer in the limits of a photo is not an easy task. one way to keep his attention is to put the image a decorative frame. this is a psychological barrier for the scattering eye. under image frame add the module can be started from image processing.</seg>
<seg id="463">Type: with this parameter you set the desired frame type for your picture. throughout, the image bordered with a colored line, Niepce surrounds it with a thin line and a wide frame (ideal for black and white pictures), bevelled it with a nice three-dimensional frame which is ideal for a button effect and decorative trim adds a decorative frame with patterns.</seg>
<seg id="464">Width: specifies the width of the frame in percent. the range of values for the width is limited from 1% to 50%.</seg>
<seg id="465">The finish image with the frame will be bigger than the original, but have the same aspect ratio. this is important for printing the images, especially if you have used the tool Folder aspect ratio beforehand.</seg>
<seg id="466">With this handy tool, you can easily insert a formatted text into an image at any position. this also goes in several places if you need it.</seg>
<seg id="467">This tool is very intuitive to use. simply enter the text and place it with the mouse. use text direction, orientation, color from the color space and the character set with its properties as you need it. the bigger the image, the greater the character set. finally, simply select a frame around the text and / or a half-transparent background.</seg>
<seg id="468">Each setting you have chosen for your text can be changed until you press the OK button. once the image has been saved, the text is part of the image. it can no longer be changed.</seg>
<seg id="469">With the & digiplug; apply tool templates you can place a template over a picture.</seg>
<seg id="470">The Picture Template menu can be used in image processing can be used to place templates over a picture.</seg>
<seg id="471">For the stencil, there are no limitations regarding size and orientation. however, you need to take the PNG file format and should work with maximum compression (9) to minimize the file size of the template. if you want to add your template to the template, just send an email in English to the & digiplug; Mailinglist digiplug-users @ kde.org..</seg>
<seg id="472">If you use this tool for the first time, you need to set your template folder with the button base folder in the dialog. select the folder in which you have copied the template files. these settings will be noted for the next start.</seg>
<seg id="473">After the root folder has been set for the stencils, a tree view appears that reflects the folder structure of the template folder. selecting a folder will automatically update the template of the template.</seg>
<seg id="474">Under the preview are three buttons with which you can change the magnification factor and the position of your image.</seg>
<seg id="475">Enlarge: this button enlarges the image below. it is centered around the position of the mouse. please check it with the left mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="476">Smaller: this button reduces the image underneath. it is centered around the position of the mouse. if you want to apply the template to the full picture, you need to reduce the image accordingly. please check it with the left mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="477">Postpone: use this button to move the image lying under the template. take the image and place it on the desired position.</seg>
<seg id="478">Use OK if you want to apply the template to your image. the image will then be adjusted automatically to the preview size.</seg>
<seg id="479">& digiplug; provides three different tools for sharpening. each of you has advantages in other areas.</seg>
<seg id="480">Sharpening is a traditional tool for sharpening. it is very fast and easy, but it generates, especially in dark areas, grainy images.</seg>
<seg id="481">Blurring mask works on the contrast of edges to make a picture sharper. actually, it sharpens not a bit, it works rather psychologically. you can use it to remove atmospheric vapor and it makes a really good job. the algorithm was taken from Gimp and it is protected by Winston Chang.</seg>
<seg id="482">Refocusing is perhaps the best of the three, since it really improves the sharpness. it is a little more complicated in its application and has different parameters to adjust.</seg>
<seg id="483">Photos without focus as well as most digitalized images require a correction of the sharpness. this is because the digitization process colors must be combined with only minimal differences to one color point. this in turn results in sharp edges a little blurred. the same phenomenon can be observed when color points are printed on paper. SLR cameras usually require more later sharpening than normal cameras for private users.</seg>
<seg id="484">In JPEG pictures, a camera is often used for internal sharpening. images in the raw format, on the other hand, must always be sharpened during processing.</seg>
<seg id="485">Some scanners use a field of sharpness during the image of the image. if you deactivate it, you will get control over your image.</seg>
<seg id="486">In some situations you can get useful results by sharpening a photo with sharpening keypad. you can use the menu entry Correcting Doing.</seg>
<seg id="487">You should handle this with caution because the results do not work very naturally: sharpening increases the sharpness of the edges, but also amplifies the noise. in general, the most useful technique for sharpening a picture is refocusing. you can refocus it via the menu entry Correct. under refocussing you will find more information and a comparison of all techniques for sharpening.</seg>
<seg id="488">Sometimes you have the opposite problem: a picture is too crunchy. the solution to draw the picture a little bit soft is much easier than sharpening it. use the tool to soften the image with the menu entry Correct softly and experiment with settings. the preview window on the right side of the dialog will show you the effect on your photo.</seg>
<seg id="489">The Filter Insharp masking is a very good tool to remove veil from your photos. you can see a demonstration here.</seg>
<seg id="490">The original image and preview help to edit the image. the preview window shows the output of the filter with the current settings.</seg>
<seg id="491">There are two important parameters, the radius and the amount. the default values often produce good results and should be tested first. an increase of the radius or amount increase the effect. if you make the blurring mask too strong, noise and impression of grates in the vicinity of sharp edges generate.</seg>
<seg id="492">The radius represents how many pixels on each side of an edge are affected by the filter. high-resolution images allow larger radii. therefore, you should sharpen images best in their final resolution.</seg>
<seg id="493">The amount represents the percentage between the original and the blurred image that is added to the original. thus the strength of the sharpness is set.</seg>
<seg id="494">The threshold value is a fraction of the maximum RGB value and the applied difference amount. thus, one can define a minimum difference to be applied for an edge of the filter. thus, areas with a soft change between the tones are excluded from sharpen and therefore plastic flaws in faces, skies and water surfaces are avoided.</seg>
<seg id="495">This is an example of the blurred mask filter. the original image is the (1) and the processed image the (2). unsharp masking was applied with radius = 6.0, amount = 0.5 and a threshold value = 0.0.</seg>
<seg id="496">The & digiplug; tool refocussing refocused an image by improving the sharpness. it used the copyrighted filtering algorithm of Ernst Lippe.</seg>
<seg id="497">This tool tries to capture a picture & quot; refocusing quot; in which it reverses the defocusing. it uses a technique called FIR Wiener Filtration. the traditional technique for sharpening images is the use of a blurring mask. refocus usually reaches better results than blurred. you can start it from the menu by refocusing colors in image processing.</seg>
<seg id="498">The Gauss's folding has a very long tail, which causes the mathematical result also from the source pixles that are far from the original source pixels. in most cases the FIR Vienna inverse of the palate is influenced very strongly from the distant pixels, causing undesirable results.</seg>
<seg id="499">Circular sharpness: this is the radius of the circular folding. it is the most important parameter for using this module. for most pictures, the default value should give 1 good results. you can set a higher value if your image is blurred, but then pay attention to halo notes.</seg>
<seg id="500">Correlation: an increase in correlation can help reduce artifacts. the correlation can be chosen from 0-1. useful values are 0.5 and the values are near 1, & eg; 0.95 and 0.99. a high value for correlation lowers the sharpest effect of the module.</seg>
<seg id="501">Noise filter: an increase in noise filter can help you to reduce artifacts. however, values higher than 0.1 are rarely useful. if the noise filter is too low, & eg; 0 the image quality is very poor. a useful value is 0.03. a high value will even further smear the image.</seg>
<seg id="502">Gauss's sharpness: this is the radius for the gauss sharpness. use this parameter if your blurring is GauÃ. this is most often caused by a previously executed blurring filter. in most cases, you should use this value to 0 to avoid annoying artefacts. if you use a value nonzero otherwise you may also increase the correlation and / or the noise filter.</seg>
<seg id="503">Die size: this value determines the size of the transformation matrix. an increase in the size of the die can produce good results, especially if you select large values for the circular sharpness or gauss' edge. however, note that the module will be very slow if you select large values for this parameter. in most cases, you should select a value in the range from 3-10.</seg>
<seg id="504">Save as and load buttons are used exactly for this purpose. any refocusing parameter you have set will be saved for later and can then be loaded.</seg>
<seg id="505">Try to perform all trimming, color and intensity corrections on the image before using the module.</seg>
<seg id="506">Otherwise, you should use the module before you change the image otherwise. the reason for this is that much operations changes which are not immediately visible, but later leave unpleasant artefacts.</seg>
<seg id="507">If you read and compress images, eg; as JPEG, you should apply the module to the uncompressed picture.</seg>
<seg id="508">Generally, unclear masking produces better results than sharpening. this could be caused by sharpening the unclear masking a larger neighborhood than sharpening.</seg>
<seg id="509">Even under optimal conditions it can never remove the effect of blurring. for the Vienna filter it is possible to show that it is the optimal Linear Filter. practically, the result of the FIR Wiener Filters is always at least as good as the blurring mask. the FIR Wiener Filter is often better for processing small details.</seg>
<seg id="510">Below you can see a comparison between the different filters on a small unfocused image:</seg>
<seg id="511">The original unsharp color picture must be corrected. this picture has been made with an analog camera. the unfocused result is due to insufficient light for the auto focus lens.</seg>
<seg id="512">For more information about the methods of sharpness correction in digital images, you can read a technical comparison in English under this address.</seg>
<seg id="513">The slider smoothes the blur of the area that has been darkened in order to create a more natural pupil.</seg>
<seg id="514">The color tinte allows an adapted color for the pupil. if you want blue eyes instead of dark, then you can adjust this here.</seg>
<seg id="515">The image error correction tool is one of the most advanced tools for removing unwanted artifacts with unprecedented speed.</seg>
<seg id="516">The painting algorithm was developed by the IMAGE team of the GREC CNRS laboratories in Caen / France and is part of the CImg project.</seg>
<seg id="517">This tool includes various presets as starting points to simplify the restoration. the available presets are listed below:</seg>
<seg id="518">If you want to finalize the filter settings, you can use the tab smoothing and advanced settings.</seg>
<seg id="519">Detail conservation p [0, 100]: this controls the preservation of the details. a small value leads to uniform smoothing over the image. whereas larger values mainly smooth homogenous regions and give details sharp. a value of 0.9 should be kept in such a way that no sharpening is necessary.</seg>
<seg id="520">Directional dependability Alpha [0,100]: a small value smoothes evenly in all directions, while a value is smoothed to 1 only in one direction. if you have a film granulation or CCD noise will produce a high value shaggy patterns.</seg>
<seg id="521">Smoothing [0, 500]: this sets the maximum smoothing factor above all. p then defines the relative smoothing. therefore, set this value matching the degree of noise in your image.</seg>
<seg id="522">Regularity: [0, 100]: this parameter concerns larger structures. the higher this value is set, the more it is smoothed. this is necessary when very much noise is present, as it is then difficult to estimate the geometry of the image. even if you want to create a 'van Gogh' Turbulence effect, it must be set higher than 3.</seg>
<seg id="523">Repetitions: specifies how often the algorithm is going through. normally, 1 or 2 is sufficient.</seg>
<seg id="524">Angle-wide angle [5, 90]: angle dependent integration of anisotropic alpha. if alpha is selected small, it should also be small. make sure that small angles yield a long runtime. thus, you should choose this value as much as possible and acceptable for your needs.</seg>
<seg id="525">Integral step width [0,1, 10]: integral step width in pixels. you should set the value smaller 1 to avoid sub-pixel smoothing and never exceed 2.</seg>
<seg id="526">We recommend linear interpolation: the more quality you receive by selecting this option is only small, but it doubles the runtime. we therefore recommend it to be omitted.</seg>
<seg id="527">The buttons save as and load do exactly this. each setting of image errors can be corrected in a text file and loaded later.</seg>
<seg id="528">Correct image errors is relatively quick at work. however, it can take a very long time and pull a high CPU load. you can therefore cancel the calculation at any time using the Abort button.</seg>
<seg id="529">Below you can see how picture errors can be corrected with Small artifacts. the module is applied on a photo that was made in Guatemala City using an analog camera. as you can see, there is a unique black artefact in the foreground that was caused by a poor film storage during the trip.</seg>
<seg id="530">The & digiplug; noise reduction is a very powerful tool to reduce noise. it uses a copyrighted algorithm by Peter Heckert.</seg>
<seg id="531">This tool provides selectable image filters to remove stains and other artefacts, e.g. from dust or hair on the lens. it can also be used to remove sensor noise from camera or Moireacute; effects of scanned images from books or magazines.</seg>
<seg id="532">If you need more information about sensor noise from digital cameras, you can read it in English in this tutorial.</seg>
<seg id="533">The screenshot above shows a typical scene made with a digital camera and a high ISO sensitivity. it shows a granular noise that can be successfully removed with this tool.</seg>
<seg id="534">The following is a complete description of all parameters. in most cases, you only need the subwindow Details and the Advanced Settings window can remain with default settings.</seg>
<seg id="535">Radius controls the window size, from 1 (3x3) to 20 (41x41), which is used for the filter. large values increase the time the filter is needed per pixel and can wipe the image. the area indicated by the radius moves over the image and the color in it is smoothed and thus minor errors are adjusted.</seg>
<seg id="536">Sharpness: controls the sharpness level. this value sets the pixel pitch to the front of the filter to determine luminance changes. if it is increased, noise levels will be deleted. if the value is too high, the adaptive filter image details can no longer be maintained and noise or lubrication occurs again.</seg>
<seg id="537">Edges: check the edge accuracy for the sharpness. this value improves the frequency response of the filter. if it is too strong, the entire noise can not be removed or noise peaks can occur. set it to a value near the maximum if you want to remove a weak noise or JPEG-artifacts without losing any details.</seg>
<seg id="538">Luminance: controls the luminance tolerance of the image. we recommend changing either color or luminance to improve an image. these settings do not affect the smoothness process that is controlled by the details pane.</seg>
<seg id="539">Color: controls the color tolerance of the image. we recommend changing color or luminance to improve an image. these settings do not affect the smoothness process that is controlled by the details pane.</seg>
<seg id="540">Gamma: controls the gamma tolerance of the image. this value can be used to increase the tolerance values of the darker areas that are typically roughed more strongly. however, it also greases the shadow areas.</seg>
<seg id="541">Damping: controls the adjustment of the phase jitter damping. this value defines how fast the adaptive filter radius responds to variations of luminance. if it is elevated, the edges appear smoother when it is too high a smearing can occur.</seg>
<seg id="542">Save under and load: these buttons are used exactly for this. all the noise reduction parameters you have set can be saved to the file system and loaded later.</seg>
<seg id="543">This is an example of how noise reduction can change your life. the original image is marked with (1) and the corrected with (2). the noise reduction was applied using the default settings.</seg>
<seg id="544">The solution to draw the picture a little bit soft is fortunately much easier than a picture to sharpen. use the tool to soften the image with the menu entry Correct softly and experiment with the smoothing. the preview window on the right side of the dialog shows the effect of this operation on your photo.</seg>
<seg id="545">The & digiplug; photo restoration is definitely one of the most advanced tools to reduce photo artifacts.</seg>
<seg id="546">This restoration filter gives you the possibility to remove a lot of unwanted artefacts from your images. it is very well adapted to remove GauÃ's noise, film granulation, scratches, compression artifacts and local errors that appear in digital, original or subsequently digitalized images.</seg>
<seg id="547">The algorithm for restoration has been developed by the IMAGE team of the GREC CNRS laboratories in Caen / Frannkreich and is part of the CImg project.</seg>
<seg id="548">JPEG artifacts reduce: compression of JPEG is not perfect, in some areas even very far away. as a lossy compression algorithm, it generates some compression & quot; artefacts quot; - small standards that can be seen in the uncompressed picture. this setting should correct these problems.</seg>
<seg id="549">The buttons save as and load do exactly this. each setting of photo restoration can be saved into a text file and loaded later.</seg>
<seg id="550">Photo Restoration is comparatively very fast at work. it can still take a long time and pull a high CPU load. you can therefore cancel the calculation at any time using the button Beaches.</seg>
<seg id="551">The module is applied to a black and white photo that with a minolta (tm) HP-5 movie was recorded onto an Ilford (tm) HP-5 movie with a sensitivity of 3200 ISO. you can see the notorious film grain on the faces. the original image is under (1) and the corrected below (2).</seg>
<seg id="552">Below you can see another example of photo restoration. this time, textures were applied to an old color photograph, which was read with a scanner. you can see the scan artefacts caused by the scanner lighting and the photo paper. the original image is under (1) to see and the corrected picture under (2).</seg>
<seg id="553">It uses algorithms from the JPEGPixi project protected by Martin Dickopp. it uses algorithms from the JPEGPixi project protected by copyright by Martin Dickopp.</seg>
<seg id="554">Bright, dead or hot pixels are a problem especially for high-quality raw mode photos, as many cameras with JPEG compression have a built-in suppression for hot pixels.</seg>
<seg id="555">This tool can be used to remove & quot; hot Pixelquot; and "quot; bright Pixelquot; on a photo with a dark image subtraction method. there is currently no manual method to select the bad pixels.</seg>
<seg id="556">Download this file in the wizard with the button dark image. the tool will automatically detect the hot and light pixels. these will be highlighted in the image preview.</seg>
<seg id="557">If you have an old digital camera it is important that you record the dark image directly in order to detect new hot or light pixels by CCD faults.</seg>
<seg id="558">First, as described in the previous section, you should load the matching dark image to the image to be corrected. an automatic processing of the dark image will find the bad pixels. note that the wizard will notice the last dark image and will load it again in the next session.</seg>
<seg id="559">The image area and preview help you to correct the result within the image. the preview window shows the output of the filter with the current settings. bad pixels are raised in all preview areas.</seg>
<seg id="560">Select an area to view the defective pixels on the preview and the results of the filter. then select the best filter method to interpolate these pixel blocks. these are the filters available:</seg>
<seg id="561">Average: an average of the adjacent pixels is determined. the resulting color is assigned to all faulty pixels in the block. for a 1-dimensional interpolation, this is made separately for the horizontal and vertical line.</seg>
<seg id="562">Linear: all pixels that have a distance of 1 from pixel block are drawn up for the calculation of a bi-linear surface (2 dim) or a group of linear curves (1-dim). these are then used to interpolate the defective pixels in the block.</seg>
<seg id="563">Square: this is the default filtermethod. all pixels with a distance of 2 or less to pixel block are drawn to calculate a bi-square surface (2 dim) or a group of square curves (1-dim) that is then used to interpolate the pixels in the block.</seg>
<seg id="564">Cubic: all pixels with a distance of 3 or less are drawn to calculate a bi-cubic surface (2 dim) or a group of cubic curves (1-dim) used to interpolate the defective pixels in the block.</seg>
<seg id="565">Below you can see the Hotpixel correction on a color photograph, from a defective digital camera with a sensitivity of 200 ISO and long exposure. the original image has been enlarged to 300% (1) and the corrected picture can be seen below (2).</seg>
<seg id="566">Die & digikam; Vignetting correction is a tool to correct the vignetting, i.e. underexposed corners, of an image.</seg>
<seg id="567">Wide angle lenses, especially those in medium and large photo format, can often not illuminate the entire sensor range evenly. instead & quot; vignetting agility; (shaded) they reduce the corners and edges of the image by reaching the light that reaches the sensor there.</seg>
<seg id="568">Many center filters need a factor of 1.5 or 2 while the iris filter, which makes it impossible to keep the camera with the hand. wide angle lenses should also be used with center filters, an aperture of f / 16 or smaller, otherwise blurring effects are caused by motion.</seg>
<seg id="569">With the large exposure areas of today's film and colour and grayscale depth of digital cameras and film scanners, it is possible to simulate the effect of a center filter by applying an equivalent transformation on a raw image that was made without this filter. the tool Vignetting Correction applies the transformation with a center filter to an image. the algorithm is protected by copyright by John Walker.</seg>
<seg id="570">With three controls you can check the Vignetting Correction filter and three further exposures of the target image.</seg>
<seg id="571">Density: this parameter controls the degree of light intensity absorption at the point of the greatest density of the filter. the standard density is 2.0, which allows an optical filter with an aperture setting of 1, or accidentally a light intensity of 2. increase the density to compensate for a greater degree of vignetting, reduce it by a small degree to compensate.</seg>
<seg id="572">Luminosity, Contrast, and Gamma Settings: editing an image with the vignetting correction reduces the brightness of the pixels. you need to adjust the exposure of the target image with these options. the controls only provide positive values, since you only have to increase the settings.</seg>
<seg id="573">If you want a finer readjustment of exposure of the target image, leave the values for brightness / contrast / gamma at zero and use the gradation from the & digicam; image processing from the Color Gradation menu.</seg>
<seg id="574">This is an example of the correction of vignetting on one image. the original image (1) shows the vignetting in the corners and (2) the corrected picture. a denial and contrast correction was also performed in the picture using this tool.</seg>
<seg id="575">The & digiplug; lens distortion is a tool to correct the impact of spherical lenses on photos. it uses a copyrighted algorithm by David Hodson.</seg>
<seg id="576">This tool works with geometric distortions. colour distortions cannot be corrected using this tool.</seg>
<seg id="577">The coefficient of the second degree deals with the general geometric distortion of the lens and can correct the concave or convex form of the image.</seg>
<seg id="578">The coefficient of the third degree has a similar rounding effect, but flattens at the edges. this correction is not applied in the tool.</seg>
<seg id="579">The coefficient fourth grades corrects the remote corners to that of the second degree. if you combine these two, any geometric distortion can be almost eliminated.</seg>
<seg id="580">In general, this value controls the strength of distortion second degrees. with negative values tone-shaped distortions can be corrected and positive values cushion distortion.</seg>
<seg id="581">Corner: this value controls the thickness of the distortion fourth. this value acts more strongly on the edges than in the middle of the image. for most lenses, the 'corners parameter has the opposite sign of the parameter in general.</seg>
<seg id="582">Zoom: this value resumes the image size and thus leads to a correction of the first degree. negative values increase while positive the image decreases.</seg>
<seg id="583">Bright: this value adjusts brightness in the corners of the image. negative values decrease the brightness of the image in the corners while positive values increase it.</seg>
<seg id="584">To help you find the best filter settings, the dialog with a preview illustrates the distortion correction. the values you use for your image are saved and used at the next start as default values.</seg>
<seg id="585">The tonne or cushion correction should be performed before all trimming or size changes. best perform this correction as all of the first. if you have to cut a picture again and then perform a tonical correction, the effect would obviously be the wrong.</seg>
<seg id="586">To help you find the best correction, this tool provides you with a vertical and a horizontal guide line. move it to an important location, such as the edge of the sea or a building wall, in your image and press the left mouse button to fix the lines at this point. subsequently, you can correct the tonne / cushion distortion with the help of the lines.</seg>
<seg id="587">If you correct a cushion-like distortion, the resulting image will have black corners. you can remove them using the trimming tool in the menu Transforming random from image editing or via the zoom knob of this dialog.</seg>
<seg id="588">The next logical step for some motifs such as photos from the front, frames and paintings is to correct the perspective so that all angles in the picture have 90 degrees. note that if you hold the camera with your hand you will always have a slight distortion of the perspective.</seg>
<seg id="589">This is an example of the spherical correction applied to a church in Norway. the original image is under (1) and the corrected picture under (2) to be seen.</seg>
<seg id="590">The algorithm is based on a method for simulating infra-red film of the Gimpenbu.org website which is accessible under this URL. the filter reproduces the well-known Ilford (tm) SFX200 Iinfrarotape, see this URL. this film has a sensitivity range of 200-800 ISO.</seg>
<seg id="591">In the left side of the window, you can select the area for the preview. if you move the red rectangle with the mouse, you can view the effect on different parts of the image.</seg>
<seg id="592">Below the preview you can set two parameters of film granulation and film sensitivity (ISO). add the option Add film granulation if you want to simulate the grainy texture of a highly sensitive film. the ISO controller changes the amount of film granulation and the dominance of color green (chlorophyll in nature) in transformation. green meadows become white like snow!</seg>
<seg id="593">As the filter mixes color channels to reproduce infrared film, especially the green channel does not make sense to apply the effect on black / white photos as the color information is missing.</seg>
<seg id="594">This is an example of the infra-red filter applied to a landscape photo of New Zealand. the original image is under (1) and the processed image under (2) to be seen. the sensitivity of the film was set to ISO 400. higher ISO values create a kind of aura in the top lights.</seg>
<seg id="595">The & digiplug; filter film granulation is an easy-to-use tool to reproduce film granulation on your images. this is known from classic high-speed films such as the B / W Kodak Tri-X. to increase the sensitivity of the movies the manufacturers blend large silver grains of photo emulsion.</seg>
<seg id="596">The film grading effect gives your photo a certain mood or seems to move back into the past. the treated image gets rid of a timeless atmosphere detached from everyday life. if you want this special, gallery-like, street-photographic, granular view specially in your monochrome photos, you must use this filter.</seg>
<seg id="597">With the regulator, the ISO sensitivity can be calibrated to control the intensity and granularity of the grains. the default value is, although often higher values are required, are set to ISO-2400. if you need even more grains, you can use the filter several times.</seg>
<seg id="598">This is an example of the film grain effect applied to a black / white image. the original image is the (1) and that worked the (2). the film sensitivity used corresponds to ISO-1600.</seg>
<seg id="599">The & digiplug; filter oil painting creates the appearance of an oil painting. it uses a copyright protected algorithm of Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="600">The & digiplug; filter oil painting gives your digital images a nice appearance like an oil painting. nature pictures and still life are good for this effect.</seg>
<seg id="601">There are two knobs to influence this effect. the upper one selects the brush size between one and five. thicker brush is better suited for large images. smoothing controls the smoothness or, from the other side, the focus.</seg>
<seg id="602">This is an example of the oil painting effect. the original picture is marked with the (1) and the processing is marked with the (2). pin size for this 640 pixel wide picture is 1 and flatten 17.</seg>
<seg id="603">The & digiplug; Filter coal drawing uses color and intensity gradients to create a coal sketch. images whose gradients vary slowly therefore are not ideal for this effect. it is helpful if you imagine which scene you would have chosen to sketch for you. this would be good pictures to start with.</seg>
<seg id="604">There are two controllers with a range of values from 1 to 100 to control this effect. the upper knob selects the pen size and the lower adjusts the contrast (smooth).</seg>
<seg id="605">This is an example of the coal drawing filter. the original image (1) and the modified image (2). the default settings of 30 and 10 have been used. the result can be further improved by adjusting the intensity value.</seg>
<seg id="606">The & digiplug; filter engraving shapes your image in 3-D as if it was stamped in wax. it uses a copyrighted algorithm of Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="607">The & digiplug; filter engraving is a fast tool to recreate your images with a 3-D effect. it works especially well with images with a simple structure where color is not the most important thing. the filter uses the differences between color and intensity to transform the image into a gray, monopic landscape.</seg>
<seg id="608">Depth allows to adjust the contrast of the filter. a value of 30, corresponds to 10%, is the default setting.</seg>
<seg id="609">This is an example of the engraving filter. the original (1) and the edited image (2). the used depth is 10%.</seg>
<seg id="610">With this filtering group you can transform a normal photograph into a work of art using distortion effects. it uses protected algorithms from Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="611">Shaft blocks 1: divide the image into cells and let it look as if it is seen through glass blocks.</seg>
<seg id="612">Shaft blocks 2: analogous to the wave blocks 1 the picture is distorted with a different version of glass blocks.</seg>
<seg id="613">Some effects require long time to calculate and produce a high CPU load. you can cancel these effects at any time using the button Beaches.</seg>
<seg id="614">With this filter group you can transform a normal photo into a work of art using blurring effects. it uses protected algorithms from Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="615">Zoom Insharper: blurred the image along star lines that emanate from one focal point. this simulates blurring a zooming camera and thus creates a dynamic expression that is often seen in sports photography.</seg>
<seg id="616">Radial blur: blurring the image by turning the pixels around a center. this simulates the blurring of a rotating camera.</seg>
<seg id="617">Distance blurring: blurred the image to create the effect of a non-focused camera lens. the object appears to step back into the background.</seg>
<seg id="618">Blurring: blurring the image through horizontal movements of the pixels. this simulates the blurring of a linear moving, z: B: from a car or train, camera.</seg>
<seg id="619">Softly blur: blurred the image softly in the dark and strong in the bright tones. this creates photos with a dreamy and shiny soft focus effect (Hamilton Effect). this is ideal for creating romantic portraits, glamour photos or adding a warm and subtle glow.</seg>
<seg id="620">Shaking Blur: wipes the image by randomly shifting the pixels and simulates the blurring of an arbitrary moving camera.</seg>
<seg id="621">Intelligent blur: finds the color font in the picture and wipes it without changing the rest.</seg>
<seg id="622">Mosaic: splits the photo into rectangular cells and then recreates it by filling with an average pixel value.</seg>
<seg id="623">Some effects require long time to calculate and cause a high CPU load. you can therefore cancel this calculation at any time using the button Beaches.</seg>
<seg id="624">The raindrops are a nice little tool to make raindrops on your image. this gives it natural to your pictures a wet look. it uses one of Pieter Voloshyn copyrighted algorithm.</seg>
<seg id="625">Drop size allows to change the size of the drops. as the drop size does not grow automatically with the size of the image it is often necessary to decrease the size for small images. number changes the number and density of drops. fish eyes change the optical effect of drops on the image.</seg>
<seg id="626">You can choose with the & digiplug; image processing an area free of raindrops. use the selection tool to select the area, e.g. a face that should remain free. if you then start the filter regentropfen, the area will remain free of raindrops.</seg>
<seg id="627">This is an example of the regentrop filter. the original image (1) shows a calm sunset and the processed image (2) indicates a sunset after a storm. the default values were used for this example.</seg>
<seg id="628">If the photo has the wrong orientation, you can put it in the right direction by mirroring or rotating. you can find the tools in the menu Transforming Rotating or Transforming Spikes.</seg>
<seg id="629">Photo bubbles is definitely one of the most advanced tools to enlarge a photo with a minimal loss of image quality.</seg>
<seg id="630">The big question is how you can inflate a picture and keep the details sharp? how can you zoom in an image when the limits of resolution are reached? how can you recover the missing information again? the Cimg algorithm used here makes a good job. try it and you will see it yourself.</seg>
<seg id="631">If a photo has the wrong size, you can scale it to the desired size with the tool size. select to change size change in the menu and specify the target values. the dialog is shown below.</seg>
<seg id="632">The size of the tool uses a linear interpolation method to approximate the pixels. if you want to enlarge a small picture with a better quality, try the tool for blowing.</seg>
<seg id="633">Many image processing programs use a kind of interpolation, e.g. spline interpolation to enlarge an image. & digiplug; uses a further developed approach. the underlying algorithm photo bubbles was developed by the IMAGE team of the GREC CNRS laboratories in Caen / France and is part of the CImg project.</seg>
<seg id="634">You need to tell the tool how to change the size. these settings are available in the New Size tab and are listed below:</seg>
<seg id="635">Maintain aspect ratio: if this setting is enabled, the aspect ratio of the original image will be retained when entering the new size.</seg>
<seg id="636">Regularity: [0, 100]: this parameter concerns larger structures. the higher this value is set, the more it is smoothed. this is necessary when very much noise is present, as it is then difficult to estimate the geometry of the image. even if you want to create a 'van Gogh' Turbulence effect, it must be set higher than 3.</seg>
<seg id="637">The buttons Save as and Load are used exactly for this. each staging for photo enlarge can be saved as a text file and loaded later.</seg>
<seg id="638">Photo bubbles are very fast at what it does, but it can take a long time and pull a high CPU load. you can cancel the calculation at any time using the button Beaches.</seg>
<seg id="639">You can see below an example for photo bubbles when a small color image has been enlarged to double size. the original is (1) and the enlarged picture (3). the preview (2) is the result of linear standard enlargement for comparison.</seg>
<seg id="640">Cutting a photo is not only a frequently performed operation, but also a frequently underestimated tool to put together a picture. to cut a photo you simply have to create with the mouse only the rectangle with the mouse, by pressing the mouse button and drawing the rectangle, you will see this rectangle then while you move the mouse.</seg>
<seg id="641">When you release the mouse button again, the area of the photo is cut off. thus you get a good overview of how your photo would look after cutting. you can change the size of the area to be sliced by dragging on the corners of the rectangle.</seg>
<seg id="642">Once you are satisfied with the cutting, use the button The trimming button of the image processing in the toolbar and the photo will be cut (Ctrl; + X).</seg>
<seg id="643">In the preview pane you can change the size of the rectangle by moving the corners with the mouse. the aspect ratio that you have defined in the dialog will be preserved.</seg>
<seg id="644">In the tool Folder aspect ratio, you can specify the orientation as portrait or landscape format. in portrait format, the greater value of the height and in the cross-format of the width is assigned.</seg>
<seg id="645">The tool Folding aspect ratio uses a relative aspect ratio. this means that it is always the same regardless of whether you use centimeters, inches or any other physical size. you can, for example, see below a list of traditional sizes for photo paper and its aspect ratio.</seg>
<seg id="646">At the right end of the dialog there are two buttons to automatically center the selection horizontally or vertically.</seg>
<seg id="647">At the bottom of the dialog you can set the range for trimming to the maximum possible, depending on the chosen ratio and orientation.</seg>
<seg id="648">The tool Folder aspect ratio cuts its settings depending on the image orientation (horizontal or vertical). if you use the trimming tool next time, these settings will be displayed as default values depending on the orientation. the changed image dimensions are saved in the EXIF tables, so that EXIF data reflect the cut image and not the original image.</seg>
<seg id="649">The settings of the integration help make it possible to fade in help, so that you can put your pictures together better. these aids are:</seg>
<seg id="650">Harmonic triangle: harmonic divides are based on the principle of similarity. like the Third elbows, harmonious triangles are a possibility to divide a rectangle in a similar harmonic triangles on the diagonal.</seg>
<seg id="651">Golden center: the golden center is a division that affects various natural growth patterns like the spiral of a Nautilus shell or the leaves of a sunflower. it appears in all sorts of things we feel as beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="652">The golden division is the irrational number 1,618033988... and it was used already by the ancient Egyptians and Greeks who constructed your temples and pyramids. artists and architects used the golden division in all times when you put together your pictures, buildings and even photos to give your creations a natural order and beauty.</seg>
<seg id="653">The number derives from the Fibonacci sequence 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34 & etc., where any number after 1 is equal to the sum of their two previous numbers. the resulting divider is 1: 1.618 the golden center. a composition that follows this rule is considered visually harmonious.</seg>
<seg id="654">The golden center provides more liquid support lines when you put together an image. these aids are listed below:</seg>
<seg id="655">The Golden Spirit will bring you good results for your photos to achieve your goal. compared to the third rule, the golden spiral produces a liquid line that can follow the eye through the image. this type of composition guides the observer's gaze along the line of the spiral and creates a symmetric visual river on this way.</seg>
<seg id="656">A further rule is the rectangles of the golden spiral, also called golden rectangles. this rectangles are used to create the golden spiral. it should give something that the eye falls into the centre of the composition. this can be a line or different objects.</seg>
<seg id="657">The Golden Triangles are also derived from the Golden Spirals discussed above. their vertices are the central points of the sides of the golden rectangles. note that in contrast to harmonious triangles, golden triangles are no equal triangles. diagonals can be placed on these lines a static object can be released more dynamically.</seg>
<seg id="658">If you use golden triangles to break your frame, you create an effect called dynamic symmetry by professional photographers. try to place your focus on one of the intersection points and other visual information in the triangles. the result is a very attractive composition that you cannot reach otherwise.</seg>
<seg id="659">The options Horizontal mirror and vertical mirror can be used to mirror the harmonic divisions.</seg>
<seg id="660">With the button color you can set the color of the auxiliary lines. if you have an image with many colors and a high contrast, the auxiliary lines can be invisible. in this way, you can adjust the color of the lines to your current image.</seg>
<seg id="661">The free rotation is a tool to rotate an image at any angle.</seg>
<seg id="662">If you take a photo then it happens easily that you do not hold the camera exactly vertical or horizontally. this creates a picture in which things are rotated around an angle. you can do this with the & digiplug; image processing and the tool free rotation. select Transforming Free Rotation and adjust the target angle.</seg>
<seg id="663">Rotate your image with the slider angle. the values on this slide are indicated in degrees. with the button Preferences, you can set the slide back to 0 degrees. a preview of the rotation is available on the right side of the window. the new dimensions of the image are shown on the top right.</seg>
<seg id="664">For your help, the free rotation module provides a horizontal and a vertical line. move the mouse pointer in the image preview to position the two lines. after moving it over an important point of the image, you can fix it with a pressure on the left mouse button. now adjust the angle as described in previous section.</seg>
<seg id="665">After turning a picture you will find unwanted triangular holes in the corners. a way to fix this is to use the function Transforming Random from image processing.</seg>
<seg id="666">An elegant way to cut the image is automatic cutting. choose one of the following options:</seg>
<seg id="667">The anti-aliasing option smoothes the image a little bit after the turn. note however the above warning.</seg>
<seg id="668">All perspective transformations are performed by a fixed point to the so-called reference point. this point is in the middle of the image and is represented by a red circle.</seg>
<seg id="669">To change the perspective, you need to use the red squares on the corners of your image. the preview is then automatically recalculated. on the right side of the dialog you will find some information that will help you to change the perspective:</seg>
<seg id="670">New width: shows the width of the new image, including empty areas created by the transformation, in pixels.</seg>
<seg id="671">New height: shows the height of the new image, including empty areas created by the transformation, in pixels.</seg>
<seg id="672">Angles at the top left: shows the current angle in degrees at the upper left corner of the transformed area.</seg>
<seg id="673">Corner right above: displays the current angle in degrees at the upper right corner of the transformed area.</seg>
<seg id="674">Angle at the left: shows the current angle in degrees at the lower left corner of the transformed area.</seg>
<seg id="675">Angle to the right: displays the current angle in degrees at the lower right corner of the transformed area.</seg>
<seg id="676">After adjusting the perspective, the image becomes a little bit greased. for a single adjustment this effect is small but two adaptations generate a double so strong effect and you should avoid this if possible.</seg>
<seg id="677">After you have adjusted the perspective, you get unhappy triangular holes in the corners. one way to clean this is to cut the image with transformable cutting from the image processing.</seg>
<seg id="678">The tool is used to move a part of the image in one direction and move the other part into the opposite direction. this is not a rotation, the image is distorted. in other words, a right angle is turned into a parallelogram. you can start this module via Transforming scissors.</seg>
<seg id="679">Scissors can be positioned horizontally and vertically at the same time. if you press presets, the angles are reset to zero. a preview of the effect will be displayed to you and the new dimensions of the target image will be displayed to the right of the preview pane.</seg>
<seg id="680">To your help are displayed a vertical and a horizontal line. move the mouse to an important point, such as the lake, a wall from a building on your image and press the left mouse button to fix the lines. you can now use the tool to adjust your image.</seg>
<seg id="681">After you have done the scaling, the image becomes a bit blurred. for a single shearing this effect is mostly negligible, but two zations produce twice as much blurring and therefore you should avoid this.</seg>
<seg id="682">After shearing, the picture has some nice triangular holes in the corners. one way to eliminate them is to cut the image with transformable cutting from the image processing.</seg>
<seg id="683">& edited; requires a number of libraries and other packages to read and write image formats. therefore, the available formats depend on your system and, in some cases, from the way these libraries are compiled. in most distributions, you will be able to edit a large number of picture formats with & edited.</seg>
<seg id="684">Because of this dependency of other libraries it is impossible to place a list of all file formats available on their system. however, you will always find JPEG and TIFF below.</seg>
<seg id="685">& digiplug; shows only files in formats to which you know. this happens based on file extension and a comparison of those with a predefined list. if the extension is listed in the list, edit the file in image editing. you can change this list of file extensions, edit & edit. see the Configuration section for more information.</seg>
<seg id="686">Almost all digital cameras store photos in one of two formats: JPEG or TIFF. some cameras even allow you to select the format to be used. a more detailed description of these file formats can be found in Wikipedia.</seg>
<seg id="687">Image compression is the application of data compression techniques on digital images. redundant information is reduced in order to save image data in a more efficient way.</seg>
<seg id="688">JPEG 2000 is also supported. generally, there are better, smoother results than JPEG in the same compression ratio. the 2000s version can also store lossless if specified in the settings.</seg>
<seg id="689">If you want to learn more about the raw image format, you can read on Wikipedia, The Luminous Landscape and Cambridge in Colour very helpful instructions in English. you can convert raw format images in JPEG or TIFF to the raw image converter from & digiplug; in the Configuration section you will find further information on how to use Modules with & digiplug;.</seg>

<seg id="701">All image processing tools like sharpening, molluscs, noise suppression, refocusing, insharp masking, & etc;. use a uniform dialog type that displays the effect in a preview before the filter is applied to the current image. below you can see & quot; texture user quot; in this dialog:</seg>
<seg id="702">(1): this progress bar shows the status of the filter on the current image. to the left of it allow five buttons to change the comparison mode of the preview area. these modes are:</seg>

<seg id="726">The & kgraphiViewer; project has set itself the goal of replacing these programs with a modern and user friendly graphical interface with all functions of a well integrated & kde; program.</seg>
<seg id="727">& kgraphically; is a KDE program for viewing & graphviz; dot; -graph.s & graphviz; programs are free layout programs. & kgraphically; displays graphs with all the features of a well integrated & kde; program in a modern and user-friendly & GUI; an. it has the following functions:</seg>
<seg id="728">Integration in & kate; and & konqueror; (so that a change of the graph in & kate; the graph will be re-calculated and displayed in & kdiagram viewer;)</seg>
<seg id="729">Menu to open the graph in & kate; open or open the graph in & kdiagram viewer; in a & kate; component</seg>
<seg id="730">Loading large graphene (currently there are problems of about 1000 nodes and a hack to show more than these nodes)</seg>
<seg id="731">Additional required software: & kdiagram viewer; is a & kde; program that presupposes the & graphiviz; tool & dot; for the representation of graphs. needed in detail:</seg>
<seg id="732">The main window displays the opened graph, each in its own sub-window. initially, when you start & kdiagram viewer; without an argument, the main window is empty as in the bottom screen shot. in this case, the toolbar contains only the icon file open and the (empty) list of last opened files. click the first icon to open the dialog file.</seg>
<seg id="733">After you have selected one or more & dot; the main window looks like in the lower screen shot:</seg>
<seg id="734">As you can see, an overview in the corner is displayed when the graph is larger than the drawing area. you can select a fixed position of this overview with the context menu or select this position automatically.</seg>
<seg id="735">Use the mouse wheel (high and down without special buttons, left and right with pressed & Alt + key);</seg>
<seg id="736">The zooming is limited in both directions by factor 10. below you see the maximum reduction of a graph.</seg>
<seg id="737">If the currently loaded file has been modified by another program, the following window will be displayed:</seg>
<seg id="738">You can choose whether the graph will be recharged or whether you want to ignore the change. & kgraphiViewer; can your decision also note, so that it will later proceed as well. if you want to change your decision later, you can set up the menu item Settings kdiagram viewer; see also.</seg>
<seg id="739">If you open a graph file outside a running & kdiagram viewer; eg; in the file browser or command line, you have the choice if you want to open a new & kdiagram viewer; or want to display the graph to be loaded in a sub-window of the already running instance.</seg>
<seg id="740">As with the last option, you can save your choice durably, but also change it with the setup dialog.</seg>
<seg id="741">At program start, you can open all graphs of your last session again. again, you can save your choice both as well as change later.</seg>
<seg id="742">You can also specify how the graph should be split to several pages. the number of horizontal and vertical sides can be freely chosen.</seg>
<seg id="743">When you use multiple pages, you can choose whether the parts of the graph coming to a page are to be adapted to this page. if you maintain the aspect ratio, the pages may not be filled in by the respective sections of the graph.</seg>
<seg id="744">Page preview with a graph across multiple pages without headline and with another font</seg>

<seg id="773">This module can be used to read and save new images from external sources. currently, two sources can be used:</seg>
<seg id="774">Scan images: uses the Kooka interface to read images from a scanner that is supported by the SANE project or another source such as video streams. to make this work you have to have Kooka and SANE installed.</seg>
<seg id="775">When you open the menu entry, a dialog appears that lets you select between all available sources on your computer. select the source from which you want to pick the image. you can also set the default source for the next time.</seg>
<seg id="776">After that, the Kooka window appears by changing the default values ductile to select your image. view the preview and adjust the range to your needs before you scan the image with the button. the estimated file size will be displayed in the right, bottom corner. in the Kooka manual you will find more information.</seg>
<seg id="777">Make sure that the window will be displayed completely, as some settings may not be displayed.</seg>
<seg id="778">After pressing the button you have to wait until the scan is completed and the window to set the options of the target image appears. please remember that the type BMP does not compress and therefore creates very large files. you must also select the folder & # 160; select or create by saving the image.</seg>
<seg id="779">Screen photos can be created after you have selected the screenshot in the Import menu. a window appears in which you can set the different screen photomodi:</seg>

<seg id="796">Flickr is an online photo management on the Internet. Flickr makes it possible to send photos to people who are important. you can show your favorite photos of the world, place photos of your camera mobile online and show your photos safely and privately to your friends and family all over the world.</seg>
<seg id="797">The exporting module to Flickr can be used to upload images from your computer to a Flickr server on the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="798">If you use the module for the first time, you will be guided through the process of generating a token. it is used for your authentication, so it is virtually your ID to Flickr. a browser is started so that you can login to Flickr.</seg>
<seg id="799">After the successful registration, the module can send photos to Flickr's website. the following page will be presented after a successful registration.</seg>
<seg id="800">Simply close the browser window and return to the program. after pressing Yes, you will see the dialog to upload photos to Flickr. this will be shown in the next section.</seg>
<seg id="801">When the module exporting to Flickr is started for the second time, you will be greeted with the following dialog, which displays the current access permissions that the module displays. for uploading you need write permissions. the module currently supports no other permissions. you will be asked if you want to continue with these permissions.</seg>
<seg id="802">The button Add photos should be pressed once you have set all the other options. with this button you can select the photos you want to upload in a file selection box. if you click on the Ok button, upload the photos to Flickr Server.</seg>
<seg id="803">The Tags field can be filled with a list of words separated by comma. these are added to the image as tags during high loading.</seg>

<seg id="809">The KIPI module for geographic localization allows to add and edit GPS coordinates in the metadata of an image. geographic data is stored in the EXIF keywords of the image and the localization can be displayed in a map in an external browser.</seg>
<seg id="810">The KIPI module for geographic localization provides tools for locating images geographically in the spherical coordinate system used by GPS and Galileo. height, length and latitude are used.</seg>
<seg id="811">To correlate your images with geographic data you need a GPS track as XML file in the GPX-format. gpsbabel and gpsman can download and convert the data for you from your GPS device.</seg>
<seg id="812">Image Geographic Localization Correlator. this interface can merge a number of previously selected images with a GPS track.</seg>
<seg id="813">Select the images you want to correlate in the main window and enter the menu. the dialog above appears then. to make a possible correlation over time and localization, you need to load a track file with GPX file. of course, this file contains data that were recorded at the same time in the same places as the pictures of your camera.</seg>
<seg id="814">If the file is loaded an automatic correlation is performed to indicate the coordinates in red. GPS track data is recorded in GMT time and therefore the camera time must be converted to GMT. this can be done with the time zone.</seg>
<seg id="815">The maximum time deviation is an upper deviation for the GPS time and camera time. if the deviation is below, the data is merged. the maximum value for this is 2000 seconds.</seg>
<seg id="816">If you do not have track data from one place for pictures, you can manually edit the GPX file and add it to the images. then, the time difference of 2000 seconds will correlate all images in this field.</seg>
<seg id="817">The options interpolate and difference in minutes can be used if you do not have suitable data. if you know that in reality a location is located in a large time difference between camera and GPS, you can set these limits here and then press the button correlate to interpolate.</seg>
<seg id="818">The coordinates can be set manually with this dialog. this is useful when you have made a number of photos at the same location. as the dialog closes the coordinates from one call to the next, you just need to use the OK button to put the data in the current photo.</seg>
<seg id="819">The location can also be found and placed with the displayed map. select the relevant region and enlarge sie.Adjust this again until you have reached a sufficient accuracy. the height must always be selected manually. the map can be changed between card mode, satellite image and a mixed mode.</seg>
<seg id="820">Completely outside the KIPI module there are possibilities to attach the GPS data to the images. here is a small script that uses the exiftool to provide a stack of images with GPS data.</seg>
<seg id="821">The KIPI Module Gallery is a tool for exporting a set of albums as HTML pages.</seg>
<seg id="822">This module can export your albums into a picture gallery from HTML pages to version 4.01. you can select the albums to export as HTML pages and specify the parameters for the HTML pages. the character set will be encoded UTF-8 to enable the best internationalization possible.</seg>
<seg id="823">The tab allows you to select all albums that should be exported to HTML. you only need to select these albums. the albums are not displayed hierarchically. with the three buttons on the right, you can quickly select a large number of albums. in the section below, the preview and the text will appear in the header of the HTML page.</seg>
<seg id="824">The Rider Appearance defines the general appearance and layout for each page. this tab is largely self-explanatory. the option For each image creates a page created a gallery in which each image also gets its own page. if you then click on a picture, a new page will be opened in which the image will be displayed. otherwise, the picture will be displayed directly with your standard picture viewer,</seg>
<seg id="825">The Rider Album defines the settings where and how to store the gallery with all your associated images. select a folder where you have write permission. a subfolder named KIPIHTMLExport which contains everything will be created there.</seg>
<seg id="826">If you have selected the JPEG file format, the EXIF information of your original images will also be saved in the new images.</seg>
<seg id="827">With other color depth, you can change the default color depth. of course, this also influences the file size. all other settings are self-explanatory.</seg>
<seg id="828">The rider thumbnails will allow you to customize some of the settings from the Album tab for the preview images, which are small images that are displayed in the gallery.</seg>
<seg id="829">A progress window will show the user how far the action is. press Cancel to cancel the process.</seg>
<seg id="830">If the module has created the pages, the window will not be closed automatically. you can therefore read the messages to see if errors occurred while generating. the web browser is started automatically at the end to view the preview of the gallery. press Close to close the module.</seg>
<seg id="831">The KIPI Image viewer is a very fast and flexible OpenGL-based tool to view images.</seg>
<seg id="832">The KIPI Image viewer allows you to view a selection of images and to perform basic operations such as rotations, zooming or moving. the viewer can be used with short commands and mouse buttons. it has been developed for fast visual display and quick access to its functions.</seg>
<seg id="833">After the start, an image will be displayed in full screen mode by default. this can be changed to a window mode.</seg>
<seg id="834">The KIPI JPEG Lossless module is a tool for changing images without compromising your quality.</seg>
<seg id="835">This module allows you to save images in JPEG format for the actions below, without the usual loss of quality or metadata.</seg>
<seg id="836">The consequence of lossless storage is that the file size increases as no compression of the color information takes place. this can be found in PNG format, for example.</seg>
<seg id="837">The KIPI module digital camera client is a tool for you to connect your computer to a digital camera.</seg>
<seg id="838">The KIPI module digital camera client currently has no documentation. if you are interested in writing these, please contact the mailing list of the KIPI team at kde-imaging @ kde.org. attention: the participants of this list speak English.</seg>
<seg id="839">The KIPI module metadata editor now has no documentation. if you want to change this situation, please contact the mailing list kde-imaging @ kde.org of the KIPI team.</seg>
<seg id="840">With the Import function of the metadata module you can copy data from one image to another. then, select the image that you want to copy in the main program and then call the import function. this then opens the file selection dialog with which you can copy the target image, so the image you want to copy the metadata.</seg>
<seg id="841">This function does not work with all image formats. you can copy from anywhere, but do not write in any target format. JPEG is supported by writing. please look here to see which formats are supported.</seg>
<seg id="842">The KIPI MPEG Kodierer Module is a tool to convert a series of images to a MPEG video in the form of a slide show.</seg>
<seg id="843">The MPEG Kodierer module can be used to convert selected images to a MPEG video, with a defined length. this module uses the MjpegTools and ImageMagick packages. you can also add a base image transition between the individual images. you can also add an audio file in the MP2 or WAV of the slide show.</seg>
<seg id="844">All images are automatically scaled to the correct size for the selected video format. additionally, you can select a background color for the video format. with this module it is possible to create the formats DVD / XVCD / SVCD / VCD for your DVD player. to burn the medium you can then use the K3b program.</seg>
<seg id="845">You must first select the images that are to be packed into the MPEG Diashau. then you can launch the module using Extras MPEG Diaschau.</seg>
<seg id="846">The images selected by you are then listed among the image files in the portfolio. there you can also change the sorting of the images or the content of the list.</seg>
<seg id="847">After you are happy with your list, you should adjust the other settings. the video format can be selected from various formats, DVD, XVCD, SVCD and VCD. if you are planning to play the file on a TV, you need to select the appropriate TV standard PAL, SECAM or NTSC. PAL is default and most likely the right choice for Europe.</seg>
<seg id="848">In the next step you should specify the time in seconds that will display a picture. the speed of the image transition is specified below. a low value creates very sudden, a high contrast, very smooth picture change.</seg>
<seg id="849">The background color can be set next. in doubt, you should let them black. you can specify the name and path of the generated file under the name of the mpeg output file. keep as soon as possible the extension mpg.</seg>
<seg id="850">If you specify an audio file under the name of the audio source file, it will be integrated into the movie. after adjusting all settings to your preferences, you can start the creation of the movie using the button code. depending on the speed of your computer, you can now quickly or quietly enjoy a cup of coffee and enjoy the slide show when you are back.</seg>
<seg id="851">If an indication appears that encoders or tools are missing, you can adjust the paths to the programs of the MjpegTools and ImageMagick packages via the button settings right down.</seg>
<seg id="852">Print Wizard allows you to print multiple images on a sheet of paper in standard photo sizes. the combined images can also be opened automatically with the image processing Gimp. this is, for example, useful to improve or print directly with the Gimp module.</seg>
<seg id="853">With this KIPI module you can import or convert your images stored in RAW format to one of three formats JPEG, TIFF or PPM.</seg>
<seg id="854">The conversion is based on the command-line tool dcraw by Dave Coffin. an original quote from Him is: do not expect from dcraw that it produces the same results as the software from your camera manufacturer. sometimes you get better results with dscraw!.</seg>
<seg id="855">First select the RAW file to be converted and start the module. the Raw image converter window then appears in the mode for a single image. with the button Preview you can view the effect of your current settings on the image.</seg>
<seg id="856">You can now adjust the values to optimize the conversion process. the first option determines whether the camera settings should be used for the white balance. the essential parameters such as gamma, brightness and red / blue amplifier can be adjusted. if the result is not optimal, you can edit the image later on.</seg>
<seg id="857">A four-colour RGBG conversion can be selected so that you can use the contrast information. if your camera works in RGB mode, the RGBG switch does not have any effect.</seg>
<seg id="858">Once you are satisfied with the preview, you can choose one of the three output formats and save the conversion result. JPEG uses a lossy algorithm and produces the smallest file sizes for it.</seg>
<seg id="859">The Tagged image format, TIFF, keeps all the information of your image and uses the lossless LZW compression.</seg>
<seg id="860">If you intend to process your images frequently or later use it otherwise, you shouldn't choose the JPEG format, as there is only a limited number of operations allowed before the image quality is worsened. TIFF and PPM are better adapted to keep the original data.</seg>
<seg id="861">If you choose JPEG as a storage format, the metadata contained in the RAW file is stored in the JPEG file in the exif information.</seg>
<seg id="862">If you have adjusted your settings, you can start the conversion using the execute button. if you want to cancel this process again, you can use Cancel.</seg>
<seg id="863">The batch processing mode allows you to convert different images at once. therefore, use this mode if you are sure, e.g. by testing on a single image, which are the best settings.</seg>
<seg id="864">The available settings are almost identical to the version for single images. however, you have the possibility to overwrite existing files automatically. this is useful if they were created in an earlier attempt. however, a preview is not available. the progress bar shows how far the conversion has progressed.</seg>
<seg id="865">This module can be used to compress all images in an album. it uses the program convert from the ImageMagick package. the following image formats are supported:</seg>
<seg id="866">This module can be used to rename all images of an album. you can set the prefix, the start number and the timestamp of the album.</seg>
<seg id="867">This module can be used to change the size of multiple images from an image collection. it uses the convert program from the ImageMagick package. you can reduce or enlarge the image. in addition, four types of image change are provided:</seg>
<seg id="868">Proportional (1 Dim.): normal size change in a dimension. the width or height of the image is selected automatically depending on the orientation of the image. the aspect ratio remains unchanged.</seg>
<seg id="869">Proportional (2 Dim.): change in size in two dimensions. here, the aspect ratio remains unchanged. you can use this option for example to adjust your image to the screen size.</seg>
<seg id="870">Not proportional: not proportional size change in two dimensions. the aspect ratio is changed with this option.</seg>
<seg id="871">Prepress: prepares the image for photo printing. the user can adjust the print resolution and the size of the photo paper. the target image, including background size, random size and background color, is adjusted accordingly.</seg>
<seg id="872">With this KIPI module you can send selected images with your preferred e-mail program. it is also possible to change the size of the images to be sent before.</seg>
<seg id="873">After you have started the module, the image window will be displayed with the images you have selected. you can add more images using the button Add images. for the last image selected, a preview will be displayed on the right.</seg>
<seg id="874">You can also drag and drop images to the list of images to be sent.</seg>
<seg id="875">Using the Images button, the selected images will be removed from the list of images to be sent.</seg>
<seg id="876">After you have selected all the images, you can open the new message window to your e-mail client using the OK button. you just have to add the addresses and the subject here. the images selected by you are already attached as attachments.</seg>
<seg id="877">Do not mind to send too many images at once. most e-mail accounts have restrictions for the size of emails to send. it might be a good idea to send multiple mails if you want to send many images.</seg>
<seg id="878">The E-Mail window is used to change the settings for sending the images. your configuration will be saved and used every time you change it.</seg>
<seg id="879">Select your E-Mail client from the menu. if you select Thunderbird, you will need to enter the right path for your installation in the input field below.</seg>
<seg id="880">If you use the Google Mail Service, you must first install the Gmail agent on your computer. you can download it here.</seg>
<seg id="881">After selecting comments in an attached file, add comments to the images in a text file and add the mail.</seg>
<seg id="882">The PNG format under the File Format menu is not very suitable to reduce the size of photo files, but it is best adapted to lossless formats such as TIFF. you should therefore use PNG when you have a fast internet connection and the photo quality is not to be changed. otherwise, we recommend the JPEG format.</seg>
<seg id="883">If you select JPEG in pictures file format and the original files are in JPEG format, then the original Exifdata will be added to the images to be sent.</seg>
<seg id="884">When the process is finished, the window will not automatically shut down so that you can view the status messages, searching for errors. your e-mail program will be started automatically at the end.</seg>
<seg id="885">After starting the module Advanced Diashau, a window with questions like you would like to show your slides will appear. you can choose between the selected and all pictures of the album.</seg>
<seg id="886">The OpenGL transitions option in the presentation will activate very elegant image transitions using OpenGL. however, you have to have a corresponding graphic card, otherwise the slide show will be very slow.</seg>
<seg id="887">The file name option ensures that the file name of the images is displayed in the lower left corner during the presentation.</seg>
<seg id="888">The loop option ensures that the presentation will be displayed in an endless loop. you can then manually start off with Esc.</seg>
<seg id="889">The option to select images randomly ensures that the images are displayed in random order. so it is not the order of the images used in the album.</seg>
<seg id="890">Between the pictures, the temporal distance between the images can be set. 1500 milliseconds are equal to 1.5 seconds and are a good standard value. however, the best distance depends on your computer and the selected transition effect.</seg>
<seg id="891">There are more than a dozen transition effects between which you can select. randomly select another effect between the images.</seg>
<seg id="892">During slide show, you can access a toolbar at the top left edge of the screen. move the mouse to this corner to turn on.</seg>
<seg id="893">With this toolbar you can pause and restart the presentation, jump to the previous and the next image and stop the slide show.</seg>
<seg id="894">At the left bottom of the screen you can see the current file name, position of the current image and the total number of images in your presentation.</seg>
<seg id="895">If you are interested in writing, please contact the KIPI team at kde-imaging @ kde.org. attention: the participants of this list speak English.</seg>
<seg id="896">The KIPI module background image is a tool to set a picture as a background image for the working surface.</seg>
<seg id="897">This module uses the currently selected image, depending on the selected option of the submenu, as a background for your KDE desktop.</seg>
<seg id="898">Once you have annotated your pictures and videos with notes, you can browse with & kphotoalbum; through these browsers, see picture. as you can see through a comparison with the image, are now available in each group, i.e. in people, places and in the group keywords.</seg>
<seg id="899">In the browser window you see the categories for which you have entered information as you have your pictures and videos with notes. additionally, there are entries to look for EXIF-based information, view the folder structure on your hard drive and of course view the current thumbnails. in the following, each one is described for themselves.</seg>
<seg id="900">If you press the mouse on the entry, the view of the browser changes. see picture.</seg>
<seg id="901">If you select another person, only the images on which both people can be seen are displayed. by this selection method you can limit the number of displayed images from a few thousand images to a few individual images.</seg>
<seg id="902">If you have selected all persons, locations and other settings, you can view thumbnails to view the images of your area of activity.</seg>
<seg id="903">In the picture each person has the same symbol in front of her name. you can save with & kphotoalbum; however, for each person you save your own thumbnail, this also applies to places, keywords and other categories you have defined yourself. see the picture.</seg>
<seg id="904">To view images next to the name, select the button located on the right of the toolbar. in the pop-up context menu you can select which view you want to use for the current category. this has the advantage that you can view icons with images of persons and at the same time a list of keywords (if you have no suitable images for your keywords).</seg>
<seg id="905">You have to decide for yourself which image should be displayed for each individual. in order to do this, you need to open the image view window (in detail) and select the image for the corresponding person in the context menu. in the check window, you can adjust the magnification factor to your wishes and select which part of the image to be displayed or cut off.</seg>
<seg id="906">If you enter the search entry in the main window, a dialog appears that is very similar to the dialog for setting the image properties. you can view this dialog once again in the image.</seg>
<seg id="907">If you enter a string in the caption or description field, the captions or descriptions of the images are searched for this text. if you want, you can also enter a date to search for; the date can be either a part of the total date, i.e. in 1971, or the complete date. you can also use a range of two dates, such as 1971-1980.</seg>
<seg id="908">With the options in the lower part of the window, you can search all images according to certain names as you can see in the picture. here, after pictures on which Jesper, but not Anne Helene are depicted.</seg>
<seg id="909">This is the user manual for & photoalbum;. if you don't like to read handbooks, but prefer to try the same functions, you have the following alternatives to this manual:</seg>
<seg id="910">Go to the home page of & photoalbum; and look at the Quick Start, the screenshots and the introductory videos.</seg>
<seg id="911">Launch & kphotoalbum; and in the first dialog, select the demo if you want & kphotoalbum; start the first time, or select the menu entry kphotoalbum; demo. then some sample images will be loaded and you can try the functions of & kphotoalbum; try.</seg>
<seg id="912">If you prefer to print out this manual, you will find it on the website of & kphotoalbum; as a coherent HTML document for downloading.</seg>
<seg id="913">At the bottom of the main window of & kphotoalbum; see the timeline. a picture of this bar can be seen here:. as the name suggests, this bar shows you date statistics about the images in your database.</seg>
<seg id="914">The timeline can display several different time units. each bar then displays a different unit. you can switch between the units years, months, weeks, hours and 10 minutes. on the picture you can see a part of a database by showing the bar only 10-minute sections.</seg>
<seg id="915">The timeline can be used in the following ways: you can change the displayed preview view from the database (if you select a date, the first image will display this date in the preview page) and also displays the current date of the currently displayed pictures when you navigate in the preview pane.</seg>
<seg id="916">You can also select a range of timeline by holding down the mouse button and drag the mouse over the ruler of the timeline, i.e. the time data. if you select an area, in the preview view only pictures of this time period are displayed. you can cancel the selection by clicking on a bar in the timeline.</seg>
<seg id="917">& kphotoalbum; provides you two ways to create HTML websites with your images. the one is in & kphotoalbum; integrated and the other available as module (see). in the following part of the user manual, the in & kphotoalbum; integrated version described, which you can create via the File HTML... menu.</seg>
<seg id="918">Before creating HTML pages, you need to make some settings. these are divided into the three parts content, layout and target. in the following, each section is described in more detail.</seg>
<seg id="919">First, enter the title of the review and a description that will contain the HTML file later. on kphotoalbum; HTML sample pages you see an example of these settings.</seg>
<seg id="920">Next, select whether a & kphotoalbum; -export file should be created which is to be seen on the overview page.</seg>
<seg id="921">Finally, you can select which information to display on the HTML pages. this allows you to avoid information that is obvious to the viewer without description. for example, that all images are from a party. note that all images are exported by a party. you can therefore not use this setting to hide certain images from certain viewers.</seg>
<seg id="922">In this section you can specify how the HTML pages should look like. most settings are unique, which is why it is not specifically addressed.</seg>
<seg id="923">At the bottom of the page you can set different resolutions for the images. this means that those who look at your website and own a monitor that supports the maximum resolution 800x600 does not download any images, which, for example, have a resolution of 1600x1200.</seg>
<seg id="924">The viewer of your page can change the resolution at any time you have specified. so it can search your images with low resolution, which leads to a lower transmission time. if you want to get an image larger, it changes to a higher resolution.</seg>
<seg id="925">In this setting, you specify the different folders and the URL where your website is stored.</seg>
<seg id="926">It is best to select a base folder for all of your HTML files and create a new subfolder for each subsequent set.</seg>
<seg id="927">First, you need to select the main folder where all your images are stored. this folder will be saved and automatically added next time. this allows you to select the location for all future images. here you can either select a folder or a KDE support protocol, for example:</seg>
<seg id="928">Once you have created your images, you can check if these really are all visible to viewers. if you select a URL for the base folder, a web browser is started after the pages are created. otherwise, the URL you specify here should be this folder. otherwise, the web browser will start in the wrong folder.</seg>
<seg id="929">If the HTML files created by you are not yet in the final destination folder, you will need to manually copy them to it. thus, the import function, see, properly works you must specify the final destination of the files. this is not the subfolder of the current files, but the base folder where all the subfolders are located.</seg>
<seg id="930">The settings described above have all three related to base folders or URLs. in these, a subfolder is created, whose name you specify in the output folder.</seg>
<seg id="931">If you are on a family celebration, a meeting in the company, a conference or somewhere else, with other users of & photoalbum; come together, you might want to create your pictures with these. however, if you have already spent a lot of time doing it, you have to work with & kphotoalbum; do not even do this work again.</seg>
<seg id="932">With & kphotoalbum; you can export a copy of your images to a .kim file. these can import others into your database. the image properties are imported and imported.</seg>
<seg id="933">There are two different types of .kim files, internal and external. they differ in whether the images themselves are stored in the file, or whether there is only one link to images in the file. the advantage of saving all images into the file is that you have all the images together and that you can pass it independently. however, the obvious disadvantage is the file size.</seg>
<seg id="934">You can either exporting a .kin file directly from the File menu... or together with HTML pages, see, create. if you create a .kim file together with an HTML file, this will be an external .kim file.</seg>
<seg id="935">An external .kim file searches the images in a twofold manner. first, it searches the images that are in the folder of the .kim file. if the corresponding images are not found, then the images of the URL you specified when creating the HTML files are searched. this is only possible if you have created your .kim file using the HTML export.</seg>
<seg id="936">In the following, the dialog for exporting images can be described, which you can view via the File Export menu.</seg>
<seg id="937">The most important option of this dialog is whether it should be internal or external .kim. there are three choices available:</seg>
<seg id="938">With the Manual Manual in the vicinity of the .kim file, you will need to copy the images to the same folder as the .kim file.</seg>
<seg id="939">With the option Automatically copy the .kim file copied & kphotoalbum; the images automatically for you.</seg>
<seg id="940">.kim files are normal zip files. since most pictures have already been compressed with JPEG, and the XML file itself is very small, it is usually not worth compressing the files. if you want to do so, simply select the Export file option.</seg>
<seg id="941">The last option of this page is to limit the maximum image size. if you send images to your friends, you might not want to send the images in full size since the .kim file would otherwise be very large. for example, you can limit size by saying that each image should be at most 800 pixels high and wide.</seg>
<seg id="942">If you select a file with the extension .kim from the web browser or from the File menu... menu, & kphotoalbum; import the exported database as described in.</seg>
<seg id="943">The importing assistant consists of four steps. first, you need to select which images you want to import, then in which folders the import images are to be copied.</seg>
<seg id="944">It may be that you can personalize the category of people to the importing file (if you are a domain), while this category is called by your database. therefore, in the third dialog window you will be asked which categories of the imported file should be imported and which categories correspond to your database.</seg>
<seg id="945">In the fourth step you can compare the categories of the file to be imported with the categories of your current database.</seg>
<seg id="946">It has to be easy to browse and view images: if you look at pictures, you often want to jump inside of different picture groups & mdash; if you look for example pictures of your Italy holiday and discover a picture with your friend, you might want to see all the pictures on which this friend is depicted.</seg>
<seg id="947">In this manual, you will go through the various steps of (1) setting the information about your images, via (2) through browsing and viewing, up to (3) advanced themes and customization options.</seg>
<seg id="948">KPhotoAlbum has been started as a program to manage your pictures. it has been extended and today it also takes care of your videos. in many places in this manual is spoken about pictures, but often this also includes videos with.</seg>
<seg id="949">& kphotoalbum; stores all its information in the file index.xml in the top folder of your images. it is a simple XML file that you can backup with a program of your choice, e.g. Normal Backup Tools, copy to a floppy or revisions in CVS, where you want.</seg>
<seg id="950">& kphotoalbum; records the folder where your images are stored and will automatically re-use it in future starts. if you want to read another folder tree with images, you can launch & photoalbum; with the -c option. for example: kphotoalbum -c ~ / company / images / index.xml.</seg>
<seg id="951">Through the menu entry Settings kphotoalbum; set up... you will get to a window with which you can change the settings of & kphotoalbum; in the following section of the user manual, you will discuss the various settings options.</seg>
<seg id="952">On the left you can see six different icons with which you can view the settings of the preview and the options for the viewer. for each setting, a detailed help is available, which you can access by pressing a button on the F1 key and a click on the desired option.</seg>
<seg id="953">It was described how you can define different properties for each image, e.g. people, places and keywords. you can also create your own groups, such as objects, animals or albums.</seg>
<seg id="954">Click on the dialog box to edit already existing groups. for each existing group, you can select a label and a symbol.</seg>
<seg id="955">In the section subcategories have already been mentioned. in the Options dialog, you can set up complete member groups, e.g. all members of a group at once in a group, instead of all groups of a member explained as explained.</seg>
<seg id="956">In the list below you can select the category you want to configure. in the left half of the window you will find a list of the current category and a list of sub-categories in the left side of the window.</seg>
<seg id="957">& kphotoalbum; splits its module system with other graphic applications, such as digiKam and Gwenview. this module system is called KIPI and means & kde; image plugin interface.</seg>
<seg id="958">The modules can be accessed via the Module Module. the modules can and will not be described in this manual since they are not part of & kphotoalbum; however, most modules have a help page that you can access via the module itself.</seg>
<seg id="959">Since modules from multiple applications are used together, it may be that the modules were tested with & kphotoalbum; only very little tested. therefore, you should always first test new modules with the demo database before using them on your own images. you can either use the command line with the command &gt; kphotoalbum -demo &lt; userinput\ &gt; or via the Help menu.</seg>
<seg id="960">The applications using the modules over KIPI are very different, whereby it can be that some modules with & kphotoalbum; not work. this is the disadvantage of sharing functions with different applications.</seg>
<seg id="961">The biggest difference between & photoalbum; and other applications that also use KIPI is that the other applications can put their images into albums. even if & kphotoalbum; this kind of order does not support, it simulates the order of albums for some modules, so that you can use the functions with & kphotoalbum.</seg>
<seg id="962">Simulated & kphotoalbum; the current album that simply corresponds to the current view, i.e. all images that show you the picture preview right now.</seg>
<seg id="963">In addition to the current album, & kphotoalbum; the modules also have to pass a list of albums. here goes & kphotoalbum; as follows:</seg>
<seg id="964">If & kphotoalbum; s Browser shows the content of a category, e.g. all persons, each entry of this category is an album for the module.</seg>
<seg id="965">Or it will use the category you specified in the settings dialog as a category for virtual albums. so, for example, if you use the category people, & kphotoalbum; so do so, whether you have chosen people to view and pass on this to the module.</seg>
<seg id="966">Since some modules with & kphotoalbum are not compatible, you can remove them from the list of modules. start the settings dialog and select in the Module area which modules should be loaded.</seg>
<seg id="967">On the picture you see an example of a start screen as soon as you start & photoalbum; start with your own pictures.</seg>
<seg id="968">As you are used by any other KDE application, you will see a menu and tool bar at the top. under the toolbar you will see the window with which you can browse your image database. currently, it does not contain much information as you do not yet have any information about your images.</seg>
<seg id="969">One of the main functions of & kphotoalbum; is the possibility to annotate any image with annotations. this includes information about the persons depicted on the picture, where the image was taken, etc. you can set any picture either individually or for a larger number of pictures at the same time. if for example on all images of Jesper is mapped and all pictures taken in Copenhagen.</seg>
<seg id="970">All these comments can be used for searching and browsing, as you can read in the section. if you want, you can see these notes when using the built-in viewer.</seg>
<seg id="971">In view of three lists with a text field, you can specify people, places and keywords. these are a very important part of & kphotoalbum; since you will always use them when you enter information about your images.</seg>
<seg id="972">The following idea is based on shifting the images within the list: if you have a family party for example, and on all 50 pictures the same 5-10 persons are shown, you can find that the names used up are moved up, the persons can find and assign them faster.</seg>
<seg id="973">If you prefer to get an alphabetically sorted list, click the Sorting icon on the list.</seg>
<seg id="974">If you have selected notes for each image individually, you may want to edit all the selected images and provide these images with notes. in this case, simply click on the front and back buttons, which are located at the top right of the picture.</seg>
<seg id="975">If you have recorded several images, e.g. with the same person, then it can be more convenient to mark all these images and use the menu item Several entries at once with a note.</seg>
<seg id="976">Las Vegas, San Francisco, Los Angeles and California are all located in the United States. in addition, San Francisco and Los Angeles are located in California.</seg>
<seg id="977">On the picture you see a browser window that shows the USA as an overgroup. to show you that it is an overgroup, a special symbol is displayed.</seg>
<seg id="978">In the Comment dialog, it is possible to add an entry to an existing or new subcategory. in addition, you can also simply drag one entry to a category and place it there to sort it into a subcategory of this entry.</seg>
<seg id="979">You can move the individual elements of the comment dialog by clicking and moving the bar that forms the upper edge of the frame. you can also make a separate window from a frame by pulling it outside the window area.</seg>
<seg id="980">If you have adjusted the window's look to your needs that you are happy with the settings, click on the Options button... that offers you the possibility to save the current setup and appearance of the window.</seg>
<seg id="981">You can also hide a frame completely. if you would like to see this window again later, use the Options button... and then hide the window. you can see this process in the picture.</seg>
<seg id="982">If you select the entry images in the browser, you will get an overview with preview images of the currently selected images, or all images if you do not have a filter. you can configure the size of thumbnails, by simply dragging the mouse with the middle mouse button. just try it.</seg>
<seg id="983">If you drop an image on the background of your desktop, this image will be set as a background image for your desktop.</seg>
<seg id="984">Once you click on an image, it will appear in the picture viewer. if you have not opened a window with an image viewer, a new display window will be created.</seg>
<seg id="985">You can also delete images in the image preview. simply select the respective images you want to delete and press either the Remove button or select Delete Selection in the Edit menu. now the window that you can see in the picture will be displayed.</seg>
<seg id="986">& kphotoalbum; provides you with a solution for this problem. you can use with & kphotoalbum; i.e., you may have saved the images somewhere, so that & kphotoalbum; you can record the view from & kphotoalbum; if not all required images can be loaded from the hard drive.</seg>
<seg id="987">Images in which the right upper corner is truncated are not stored on the hard drive. however, for the images 5-9 the thumbnails are present, so that & kphotoalbum; you can also view these images with the image viewer.</seg>
<seg id="988">As you can see, this function requires you to copy files from the folders and copy them back. so far, it doesn't support you to insert the CD in question. so, if you want to avoid trouble, such as the mess of your pictures, please buy a larger disk to save all images.</seg>
<seg id="989">In the Picture Gallery, you will find a submenu with the name privacy. if you want to have a little more privacy, filter the pictures so that at the end those who wish to make you inaccessible and click on the Current View menu in the privacy menu. alternatively, you can control all images that your little sister may see, control and lock the menu item Anything except current view.</seg>
<seg id="990">With this you have specified which images should be hidden in the case of the case. if you give your laptop to your little sister, simply select the menu entry images, which will hide all the images that you have locked. if you want to get the pictures displayed again, click on lock.</seg>
<seg id="991">It is also possible to specify a password that must be entered to unlock the images. to set up this password, simply select your password in the privacy menu.</seg>
<seg id="992">Please keep in mind that this picture protection is not very secure. on the one hand, all images on the hard disk and on the other hand can read or delete the password as unencrypted text. this type of password protection is only for those who are with & kphotoalbum; not very familiar with the view of private pictures.</seg>
<seg id="993">The reason you all have your pictures with & kphotoalbum; manage and spend hours over hours with it is natural that you want to look at them sometime. for this reason, & photoalbum has a picture _ and video viewer. you can start from the preview as described in.</seg>
<seg id="994">The viewer can see you in. it of course shows the picture, but additional all the information you have entered via the image, such as who is on the picture, when and where it was made, etc.</seg>
<seg id="995">If the info box on the upper part of the image you want to see, you can simply drag and drop it with the mouse. you can also configure what information is displayed and whether information should be displayed at all. all these options are available right clicking on the viewer.</seg>
<seg id="996">If you click on Anne Helene, the browser will show you all the pictures of Anne Helene. as if you had selected persons from the browser and then Anne Helene.</seg>
<seg id="997">If you have multiple images loaded in the viewer, you can switch between them before and back by clicking the image up and down the image. you can jump to the first and last picture with Pos1 and End. these functions can also be accessed from the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="998">If multiple images are loaded in the viewer, you can run them as slide show. & kphotoalbum; then load a new image after a few seconds. how often a new image can be checked by pressing the Ctrl key and plus or minus. start and stop the slide show by pressing Ctrl; S.</seg>
<seg id="999">A very useful feature of the viewer of & kphotoalbum; it is possible to switch to full screen mode. in this mode, the viewer uses the complete space on the screen. simply use the input key to switch to full screen mode and back.</seg>
<seg id="1000">When you use the viewer you can zoom in and zoom in. to zoom in, you can simply drag a rectangle with the mouse. with the Minus button you can zoom out again The plus button zooms in in the middle of the image. shows how a zoom rectangle is marked and shows the result of the zooms.</seg>
<seg id="1001">With the point key, you can reset your zoom so that the image is not zoomed. with the key, the zooms sets so that each pixel corresponds to a pixel of the image on the screen.</seg>
<seg id="1002">Note that the only zoom operations that work in videos that come in and out with the plus and minus key are.</seg>
<seg id="1003">With the rotation functions from the context menu you can turn the image. this does not work for videos. you can make notes to the current picture with the menu item notes from the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="1004">If you look at pictures, you can find a picture with a person whose name you have forgotten to put on the image. at the moment you can view the image and open the configuration dialog of the image to enter that name. however, you may prefer to select only the image and view more images.</seg>
<seg id="1005">Another situation is that you want to send a number of images to a printer to get the pictures developed on paper. to see which photos you want you can start the viewer with the pictures and mark them as good or bad while you view one by one.</seg>
<seg id="1006">For the two examples above, the viewer gives you the possibility to display images with features while watching them. features are the letters A to Z and you can set a feature by pressing the corresponding letter. in view you see an image with which the features A, B and C are set.</seg>
<seg id="1007">Once you have highlighted features on your images, they are available in your browser. so you can see all the images you are editing, printing or whatever you choose, so you can use a module to copy the selected images to a CD or whatever you want to do.</seg>
<seg id="1008">Categories and special features can be displayed in the preview view. if you want to display categories in the thumbnail view, then you can add features to the images by simply pressing the letter for the feature after selecting the image. this can be seen here:</seg>
<seg id="1009">Sometimes it is not clear what you want to show on a picture. in this case, you will be allowed & kphotoalbum to paint on the picture.</seg>
<seg id="1010">The mixture is not saved with the image, but in the database. in the way you can undo your painted one later.</seg>
<seg id="1011">In the picture you can see a picture on which it was painted. to turn on the painting mode of & photoalbum; switch on the painting from the context menu. to terminate the painting, simply press the cross in the toolbar at the top of the window.</seg>
<seg id="1012">To work with & kpovmodeler, you need to use the program & Povray; not completely rule, but the documentation about & Povray; should you have read and understood absolutely.</seg>
<seg id="1013">In the object tree you can select individual objects. then their properties are displayed in the object properties and the object is displayed in the wiremodell- views yellow.</seg>
<seg id="1014">You can also select multiple objects at the same time, but not the object of an already selected object, as all subobjects are already selected using the object.</seg>
<seg id="1015">To insert a new object into the object tree, select the position where you want to insert the object and click on either the toolbar icon or select a menu item in the menu item.</seg>
<seg id="1016">If there are multiple possible positions, the following drop-down menu will be displayed so that you can choose the correct position:</seg>
<seg id="1017">Deleting either from the menu bar under Edit or from the right mouse button context menu you can remove selected objects from the scene.</seg>
<seg id="1018">If you have changed properties, click Apply to take these changes. if you have entered invalid values, a message will be displayed with an error description. then you can correct the input errors and click Apply or discard the changes.</seg>
<seg id="1019">If you enter the path to & Povray; -user documentation in the setup dialog, you can call the & Povray; -reference to the displayed object with help.</seg>
<seg id="1020">You need the & Povray; 3.1g or 3.5 HMTL user documentation to use this feature. if this documentation is not included in your distribution, you can download it here. & Povray; 3.5 already contains the user documentation.</seg>
<seg id="1021">When you edit a texture or part of a texture, you can see a preview in the property view.</seg>
<seg id="1022">Press preview in the property view and a small sample of the scene is rendered with the selected texture. as default, the entire texture is rendered even if you want to render a subarranged element (for example a texture inside a texture map and not the entire texture map), check locally.</seg>
<seg id="1023">The screenshot shows the control points of the camera. you can drag these checkpoints with the mouse button and change the position and direction of the camera.</seg>
<seg id="1024">When a transformation is selected, the control points disappear and a small cross is displayed in the wire model view. this cross marks the center for scaling and rotation as well as the position for shifts. you can change the shift by dragging with the mouse within the entire window.</seg>
<seg id="1025">Each object has a visibility level as a wire model. you can specify this value relative to the visibility level of the parent object or as an absolute value. objects are only displayed when they are selected or their visibility level is smaller or equal to the visibility level chosen in the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="1026">& kpovmodeler; has a window arrangement as default. the object tree and the view of the object properties are displayed on the left and the four graphical views on the right.</seg>
<seg id="1027">If you don't like the standard window arrangement or if you need a different arrangement, you can set it arbitrary. you can also store several window arrangements and simply switch between different configurations.</seg>
<seg id="1028">To anchor a window above or under a view, drag the start to the top or bottom of a view. a rectangle then indicates the new position.</seg>
<seg id="1029">To create a new column, drag the start to the right or left side of a view. the new view is then anchored to the right or left side of this view and extends over the entire height.</seg>
<seg id="1030">If you want to arrange multiple views on top of each other, drag the beginner in the middle of a different view. you can then switch between views by clicking on the flashcards top in the views.</seg>
<seg id="1031">The last possible window arrangement are floating screens: views that are not anchored in the main window. to solve a view from the anchorage, drag the beginner onto the desktop or click on the small arrow pointing to the left in the chamfering bar.</seg>
<seg id="1032">To close a view, click on the small cross in the chamfer strip. to prevent closing, click the small square between the arrow and the cross.</seg>
<seg id="1033">You can insert additional views into the main window. in the View menu, you will find entries for each type of views. new views are floating, you can anchor them at any point.</seg>
<seg id="1034">You can save the current window view with view window arrangement... Save. it displays a dialog where you can save the window arrangement under an existing or new name.</seg>
<seg id="1035">If you have created a scene, you can render it. & kpovmodeler; used & Povray; 3.1g for rendering, this program must be properly installed. as this manual was written, & Povray; 3.5 currently. this version is not supported in & kpovmodeler; version 1.0.</seg>
<seg id="1036">To render the current scene click on the Rendering icon The icon Renders in the toolbar or select the menu entry View scene.</seg>
<seg id="1037">A render mode matches the entries in & Povray; s ini files. it determines the image size and quality of rendering. if you want to render a scene in different image sizes and quality levels, you can insert any number of render modes, from a quick preview to full images of the highest quality.</seg>
<seg id="1038">When you click on the render settings icon in the toolbar or in the View Render modes menu, the following dialog will be opened:</seg>
<seg id="1039">Each render mode has a name. you can enter any name, but useful is a name that lets you recognize the properties of the mode.</seg>
<seg id="1040">In the map file size, you can enter the width and height of the rendered image. if you want to render only a small area of the image, select the box section and enter the image cut for rendering into the input fields.</seg>
<seg id="1041">In combination field quality you can choose Properties, which & Povray; for rendering. this comes from a very simple color and light model to a model with complex-diffuse reflection light. a detailed description of render characteristics can be found in the User Manual & Povray;.</seg>
<seg id="1042">If an image is rendered with only one beam per pixel, various errors can arise. these images often have a MoirÃ© pattern or step effects in curves and lines, and sometimes details are not displayed when they are smaller than a pixel. this effect is called aliasing.</seg>
<seg id="1043">& Povray; uses a technique called anti-aliasing to reduce the impact of these errors. generally, pictures with this property look better.</seg>
<seg id="1044">If you turn on anti-aliasing, calculate and connect & Povray; more than one beam per pixel. this technique is called super sampling.</seg>
<seg id="1045">& Povray; supports two methods of super sampling. as standard is adaptive, non-recursive method; adaptive because the super sampling gets the adjacent pixels with it. the second method is adaptive-recursively; recursively because each pixel is again split and adapted because the recursion depth depends on the calculated color values.</seg>
<seg id="1046">If you choose the first method, POV-Ray tracks a beam per pixel. if the difference between the color values to the adjacent pixels passes the specified threshold, then both pixels are calculated by tracking a certain additional number of pixels with super sampling. if you set the depth value to 4, a grid of 4x4 increments will be calculated, at a depth of 5 then 5x5 (25) additional rays per pixel.</seg>
<seg id="1047">The difference between two pixels is calculated as follows: r 1, g 1 and b 1 are the values for red, green and blue of the first pixel, r 2, g 2 and b 2 are the values for red, green and blue of the second pixel. the difference is:</seg>
<seg id="1048">Training for abs (1 -r 2) + abs (b 1 -g 2) + abs (b 1 -b 2)</seg>
<seg id="1049">The recursive method starts with 4 rays per pixel. if the difference between the color values exceeds the given threshold, then the pixel is divided into 4 sub-pixels, which are followed individually and checked for further subdivision. the maximum depth of recursion can be adjusted with the depth value.</seg>
<seg id="1050">Another way to reduce the aliasing effect is the creation of noise for the ray process called Jittering. if you switch on Jittering, changed & Povray; the rays by a tiny amount to avoid regular patterns.</seg>
<seg id="1051">The last setting for the quality of rendering is diffuse reflection. this is an experimental characteristic of & Povray; the diffuse reflection of light is calculated. it takes a very long time to calculate a scene with this property.</seg>
<seg id="1052">On this map you can specify whether the alpha channels should be calculated by POV-Ray. a pixel is then transparent when the corresponding rays have no object.</seg>
<seg id="1053">Open a new window for displaying the & Povray; console output. if & Povray; unexpectedly, you can find the reason here.</seg>
<seg id="1054">To import a & Povray; scene, select the menu entry file import... and select a file in the dialog box.</seg>
<seg id="1055">Currently supported & kpovmodeler; not yet the complete command range of & Povray; if error messages or warnings occur when importing, a dialog box displays a list of all messages.</seg>
<seg id="1056">If you do not support source code in & kpovmodeler; want to import, write this source code between the two particular comments / / * PMRawBegin and / / * PMRawEnd.</seg>
<seg id="1057">You can drag objects from the object tree to the editor to export the source code for & Povray. this adds to the source code of the object into the open text file in the editor. to import objects to the scene, simply select the source code in the editor and drag it to the object tree.</seg>
<seg id="1058">With copy and paste in & kpovmodeler; and in your editor you can also insert source code for & Povray; also.</seg>
<seg id="1059">The POV-Ray command is called when & kpovmodeler; a scene renders. usually this is povray or x-povray.</seg>
<seg id="1060">If you click on help in the property view, it opens and kpovmodeler; s & Povray; user documentation for the displayed object. place the path to your base and the version. supported are versions 3.1g and 3.5.</seg>
<seg id="1061">& Povray; searches for external files (e.g. High Field Data) in the paths to the & Povray; libraries. if you include files that are not in the folder of the scene, you must also enter the path to these files here. if a file is found in different paths of the library, the first found file is used.</seg>
<seg id="1062">The color for the wire models. the second color is used for displaying the selected objects.</seg>
<seg id="1063">The color for the control points. the second color is used for viewing the selected control points.</seg>
<seg id="1064">The color of the rectangle for the field of view in the camera view and in the window type mark.</seg>
<seg id="1065">You can set the object beginning of the points to the grid in the context menu of the wire model views. you can set the grid separately for shifts, scaling and rotations.</seg>
<seg id="1066">Larger values result in a more precise wire model and therefore better approximation for the displayed objects, but require more time to render. for some objects such as the ball, you can set the level of detail for two directions separately.</seg>
<seg id="1067">If you cross high level of detail for advanced projections, all wire-model views are further subdivided when the camera uses an extended projection. advanced projections are all projections with exceptions of perspective and vertical projections. this feature gives a better approach for projections but requires more time to render.</seg>
<seg id="1068">When you cross the wall, a wall behind the objects is rendered. the wall is displayed in a chess board pattern consisting of two adjustable colors.</seg>
<seg id="1069">When you tick the ground, a ground beneath the objects is rendered. the floor is represented in a chessboard pattern consisting of two adjustable colors.</seg>
<seg id="1070">If you tick the edge smoothing, the non-recursive antialiasing method is used for rendering the scenes. you can set the values for depth and threshold value.</seg>
<seg id="1071">On this page you can change existing window arrangements or create new window arrangements. in the window arrangement section, it explains how to create and store window orders.</seg>
<seg id="1072">The standard window arrangement: displays all existing window arrangements. & kpovmodeler; uses the selected window arrangement at startup of the program.</seg>
<seg id="1073">The list of windows orders shows all existing window arrangements. you can create a new arrangement with the Add button and delete a selected arrangement with the Remove button.</seg>
<seg id="1074">Each window arrangement is identified by the name. the name must be unique and must not be empty.</seg>
<seg id="1075">The list below the name shows all the views for the selected window arrangement. new views can be created using the Add button and deleting selected views using the Remove button.</seg>
<seg id="1076">New column lets you create a new column on the right of the existing window, with Unten anchored the window under the existing window, with card card you get a flashcard view together with the previous view and floating anchored the view not in the main window, but creates a separate window.</seg>
<seg id="1077">So you just have & Povray; and & kpovmodeler; installed and now you want to start without any more accurate knowledge of both programs. if you follow all steps in this guide, you should create the ultimate but simple scene, very popular among beginners: a ball on one level.</seg>
<seg id="1078">But you should carefully consider the following warnings before you complain that you only get a black screen as a result. if you use a 3D program for the first time, you should observe these important rules:</seg>
<seg id="1079">If you do not set a camera, no rules can be used for rendering, as a result you get a black picture.</seg>
<seg id="1080">If you do not include light sources, your entire scene is in the dark and you get only a black picture.</seg>
<seg id="1081">If you have installed everything error-free, you will see at the first start of & kpovmodeler; the following default window arrangement:</seg>
<seg id="1082">Take a little time to get to know the menus and the existing toolbar icons. please read the documentation to get a reasonable idea of what you can expect from this program.</seg>
<seg id="1083">You will need to use these menus and icons now, so you should remember the menus and icons and their application.</seg>
<seg id="1084">& kpovmodeler; starts with a simple scene. to follow this guide, first you need to remove all objects from the object tree. select the scene and then select Edit menu item Edit. so you now have a scene without objects.</seg>
<seg id="1085">The wire model view shows how the camera sees the whole scene that you create. in particular, you will notice this in the fourth wire model view (right below). this is the view of the scene from the point of view of the camera. this shows you the result of the rendering of the scene.</seg>
<seg id="1086">The object tree now contains a new entry with the name camera. if you click on it, you will see the contents of the object properties in which the various parameters of the camera are found. in the user documentation of & Povray, you will find more details.</seg>
<seg id="1087">Do not change the basic settings of the camera, this is reserved for later instructions, but note that the camera in the view has control points with which you can change the target point of the camera. just click on a control point with the left mouse button and drag it to the desired location.</seg>
<seg id="1088">When you apply the Apply button or the Enter key, the wire-model views and the object tree change immediately according to these settings. as a result, they see the scene from the camera's point of view.</seg>
<seg id="1089">There are many ways to create the floor for the scene. you could, for example, insert a cube (insert final body quiz) and adjust the size to x = 100, y = 0 and z = 100, but this is a cumbersome method to solve this task.</seg>
<seg id="1090">& kpovmodeler; actually provides a simpler way. you can use an infinite plane as floor:</seg>
<seg id="1091">A good advice: select the level in the object tree, change the name and then press the Apply button or enter the Enter key. in the object tree the new name will be displayed immediately.</seg>
<seg id="1092">The wire-model view now also shows the level, albeit at the moment only as a finite plane. if you render the scene, the plane expands to the horizon.</seg>
<seg id="1093">If you look at the object tree accurately, you will find that you can fold the item for the bottom if you click on the icon + in front of the object. in this case, you will only see the default options for each new object: scaling, rotation and shift. select one of these options, change the possible settings in the view of the object properties.</seg>
<seg id="1094">In this scene you should move the bottom to the exercise a unit under the horizon line, just to get to know some of these parameters. select shift and set the values as follows:</seg>
<seg id="1095">First select the bottom to adjust its material properties. there are many different materials, but select something simple at the moment.</seg>
<seg id="1096">In both cases, a dialog opens in which you can select how to insert the object. please select first subobject. the pigment will then be displayed in the object tree. you can change the name in the property view (name = ground pigment), with a click on the button Preview you will see how the pigment looks now.</seg>
<seg id="1097">Of course, the preview of the pigments only shows a matt black material because you have to enter the pigments settings at any time. always remember that you can check the appearance of materials at any time with a click on thumbnail. also, there are many options again, but now take the easiest.</seg>
<seg id="1098">If you do not see color on the fader and ball in the preview, click on the Apply button and then call the Preview.</seg>
<seg id="1099">The material for the floor is now set correctly. if you render your image now with a click on the icon, you should get the following result:</seg>
<seg id="1100">In the color list you need to enter two new attributes. in the color list you must enter two new attributes, called Unicoloured. then edit this entry twice (you can also do this more frequently, but the chessboard color list can only be used with two colors):</seg>
<seg id="1101">In the object tree, select monochrome each time and change the colors in the view of the object properties:</seg>
<seg id="1102">This step should be easy to carry out as you should have understood the basic working method of & kpovmodeler; you should have understood the ball as easy as the floor:</seg>
<seg id="1103">In the view of the object properties, you can immediately change the settings. set the value for the radius: on 1 (Do not forget to apply the Enter key or the Apply button) so the ball has contact with the ground. otherwise, the ball would float above the ground as you have moved the bottom to one unit downwards.</seg>
<seg id="1104">Of course rendering now results in a strange result: as seen before, the ball surface appears like a matt black material. in the following step, put a suitable material.</seg>
<seg id="1105">If you have selected the ball, you can assign a material to it now. as with the bottom, give the ball a pigment as a color:</seg>
<seg id="1106">Select first sub-object and change the name for example in sphere pigment. click on sphere pigment, then select Unicoloured and set the values as follows:</seg>
<seg id="1107">But you can achieve more interesting effects if you take the time to set some finish features:</seg>
<seg id="1108">Then change the values as shown in the following screenshots and click Apply or press Enter.</seg>
<seg id="1109">The settings shine effect and reflection already result in good visual effects, perfect for glass or chrome-plated surfaces, even when metal is not selected at all:</seg>
<seg id="1110">You should now have a good impression of what possibilities and kpovmodeler. hopefully you have learnt so much that you can create simple but beautiful scenes.</seg>
<seg id="1111">Raytracytracing is a Render method to create a two-dimensional image of a three-dimensional scene or model.</seg>
<seg id="1112">If you raytracing a scene, the renderer will shoot hypothetical rays from the viewer's perspective (i.e. from the camera that renders the scenes) by each pixel in the scene. the render calculates how this beam is reflected and broken through the objects, the visual effects of light sources in the scene and how atmospheric effects such as fog works.</seg>
<seg id="1113">As you can imagine, you won't see anything without a camera, the camera is your eye with which you look at the scene. without a light source you also don't see anything, the image is black. obviously any scene that should be rendered, some light sources and at least one camera.</seg>
<seg id="1114">In the usual file dialog, you can select your file. Povray files usually have the file extension * .pov or * .inc.</seg>
<seg id="1115">Opens a file. in the default file dialog, you can select a file you have previously created with & kpovmodeler;</seg>
<seg id="1116">Whenever you open or create a new model, the file is inserted into this submenu and replaces the oldest entry in the list.</seg>
<seg id="1117">If you have already saved the model, it will be saved under the same name. if it is a new file, you will need to enter a name and space.</seg>
<seg id="1118">Recovers the scene in the last saved version. all changes since the last saving will be discarded.</seg>
<seg id="1119">This menu entry can only be selected if you still have unsaved changes in the scene.</seg>
<seg id="1120">Repeat the last reversed command. this menu entry can only be selected if you have used editing undo.</seg>
<seg id="1121">Stores the current window arrangement and opens a dialog where you can enter a name for a new arrangement or overwrite an existing order.</seg>
<seg id="1122">In this menu you will find options for setting & kpovmodeler; here you can change the look, the shortcuts and the default behavior.</seg>
<seg id="1123">Opens a dialog to change the keyboard shortcut. you can change or add new commands for & kpovmodeler with this option.</seg>
<seg id="1124">Opens a dialog to set up the toolbar. you can add and remove tool icons for & kpovmodeler with this option.</seg>
<seg id="1125">A Bump Map is a way to simulate harsh surfaces without having to model each bump on the surface individually and without changing the geometric shape of the object itself.</seg>
<seg id="1126">It is common to use the same file for both a dump-map as well as for a texture mapping.</seg>
<seg id="1127">Basic bodies are simple geometric shapes that you can use as building blocks: very complex 3D models are created from dozens or even hundreds of these basic bodies. these models are then further machined to give them a more realistic appearance.</seg>
<seg id="1128">A texture map is a way to give the surface of an object color to pixel base by applying an image file as a color chart.</seg>
<seg id="1129">& kuickShow; is a comfortable image viewer and browser. the application has a file browser in which you can select pictures for viewing.</seg>
<seg id="1130">Images can be displayed either in their own window in the size of the image or in full screen mode.</seg>
<seg id="1131">The use of & kuickShow; is very simple. the file browser lists files you can view by clicking the & LMBs; or the Return key.</seg>
<seg id="1132">You can specify whether any image should be displayed in your own window, or whether all images should always use the same window.</seg>
<seg id="1133">If you are looking for a specific file, just type the first character of the file name in the browser window. then a small input field appears in the right lower corner. if a matching file name has been found, the file will be highlighted. you can leave the input field by pressing Return or & Esc.</seg>

Select.</seg>
<seg id="1182">You may set up existing multimedia keys in such a way that they work as & Amarok; short commands function. this will make your keyboard to & Amarok; control center.</seg>
<seg id="1183">The DCOP interface of Amarok has many general functions that can be found in other KDE programs. this section consists of six parts and is intended to describe DCOP functions of collection, context browser, player, playlist, playlist browser and scripts.</seg>
<seg id="1184">Amarok supports the command-line options of Qt and & kde; in addition, Amarok has some of its own command-line options.</seg>
<seg id="1185">You should give the user feedback if the script cannot be executed because of a missing dependency. please check in your script if all the required modules are present and use kdialog for the user to know why a script does not run.</seg>
<seg id="1186">Begin require 'Korundum' Rescue LoadError error = 'Corundum (KDE bindings for ruby) from kdebindings v3.4 is required for this script.' 'kdialog --sorry' # {error} 'exit end</seg>
<seg id="1187">In the scripts / templates folder, you will find a lot of template scripts in many different languages. you can use them as the basis for your own scripts or simply widen them to the required functions. you will quickly find that writing scripts is relatively easy.</seg>
<seg id="1188">Using DCOP, your scripts can exchange data with Amarok and control Amarok. the easiest way is to use the dcop command, which should be included in any KDE installation.</seg>
<seg id="1189">Most scripting languages make it possible to execute external programs and commands. usually the function exec () is used. in this way dcop &gt; can be accessed relatively easily. here is an example in Python:</seg>
<seg id="1190">& Amarok; sends alerts to all running scripts. to do this, strings are written to the default script. for this reason, scripts should constantly monitor their default input and react accordingly to events. of course, a script can also ignore events if there is no use for it.</seg>
<seg id="1191">Configure the script to view the setup dialog. to save and load the setup data, each script must take care of itself. when a script is started, Amarok puts the working folder to the folder where all data should be stored.</seg>
<seg id="1192">TrackChange indicates that a new piece is being played. now the script could & zb; with DCOP functions it could query more information about the new piece (for example the metadata or the unit length).</seg>
<seg id="1193">Volume Change newVolume indicates a change in volume. the new volume is an integer between 0 and 100.</seg>
<seg id="1194">CustomMenuClicked: submenu itemTitle paths contains the path to the selected files in the playlist when a custom menu item is clicked. to remove an entry, you can use dcop Amarok script addCustomMenuItem (submenu itemTitle) to remove an entry. to remove an entry, use dcop Amarok script removeCustomMenuItem (submenu itemTitle).</seg>
<seg id="1195">Before & Amarok; exit, or when the user stops a script, sends & Amarok; the signal SIGTERM to the script. this signal should be processed in order to do e.g. clearing operations, such as storing data or configuration settings.</seg>
<seg id="1196">Amaroks script administration can also install script packages that the user & zb has downloaded from a web server. such packages are basically normal Tar Archives (.tar), which can optionally also be zipped with bzip2 (.bz2).</seg>
<seg id="1197">& Amarok; 1.3 will only accept script packages with the Encryption amarokscript. for this reason, you should rename your script packages.</seg>
<seg id="1198">The main script must be executable (+ x), the rest to be loaded should not be executable. use the Tar parameter -p to get the file permissions:</seg>
<seg id="1199">When your script package is ready, you can append it to www.kde-apps.org and attach the link to the Wiki scripts page of & Amarok. for your entry on kde-apps you should use the category Amarok; scripts.</seg>
<seg id="1200">& Amarok; is an audio player for & kde;. & Amarok; has many useful and powerful features and is nevertheless surprisingly easy to use.</seg>
<seg id="1201">With & Amarok, you can simply drag music to the playlist instead of having to go through endless menus. you may also search only a very specific title for thousands in your collection. with & Amarok; 's Collection Browser and Quick Search you will find the piece within seconds.</seg>
<seg id="1202">Maybe you already have some playlists, but you can never decide what you want to hear? then, the playlists browser is just the right one for you. and if you still find it difficult, the dynamic mode and the smart playlists automatically select the right music according to certain criteria.</seg>
<seg id="1203">Amarok has an excellent support for Apple's iPod, iRivers ifp and many generic USB devices. furthermore, many different audio systems can be used, so that YOU can choose how to listen to your music. Amarok is intelligent, sexy and chic - just the right way to rediscover your music!</seg>
<seg id="1204">Usually you have to enter the following folder to compile and install Amarok in the base folder of the Amarok sources:</seg>
<seg id="1205">Da & Amarok; autoconf and automake used, you should not have trouble while compiling. if you encounter problems, please report them in the & kde; mailing lists.</seg>
<seg id="1206">& Amarok; like most applications, has some options that you can enable or disable at compile time with the configure script. this is a list of available options.</seg>
<seg id="1207">For some of the compile options, certain dependencies must be met so that they can be used. details can be found in the System Preferences section.</seg>
<seg id="1208">Enabled debugging symbols. you have the choice between yes, no and full. if you want to help with the development of & Amarok, you should use full.</seg>
<seg id="1209">& Amarok; can be set up without difficulty using the setup dialog. the setup dialog has several card cards to set up the various functions of & Amarok;.</seg>
<seg id="1210">In the player window, the player window will be switched on or off in addition to the playlist. if the option is switched off, only the playlist window will be displayed.</seg>
<seg id="1211">Use mood barometer: this function is only available if & Amarok; compiled with support for moodbar. the option turns on the experimental function of the mood barometer.</seg>
<seg id="1212">Impressive design: this function is only available if & Amarok; compiled with support for moodbar. this changes the color scheme used for the mood barometer.</seg>
<seg id="1213">Drop Voting Files to the music files: this feature is only available when compiled with moodbar. if this setting is enabled, .mood files will be stored on the location of the appropriate music files. otherwise, the .mood files will be stored in the Settings folder of & Amarok; stored (usually ~ / .kde / share / apps / Amarok / moodbar /).</seg>
<seg id="1214">External browser: lets you select which browser of & Amarok should be started when a browser is required.</seg>
<seg id="1215">Other browsers: here you can specify the path to another browser, which is not in the list above.</seg>
<seg id="1216">Save Playlist when you exit, save the current playlist automatically when you exit & Amarok; enable this option if you don't want to lose the current playlist when you exit.</seg>
<seg id="1217">Relative paths for manually stored playlists: when you enable this setting, & Amarok; relative paths to the music files, based on the location of the playlist, will be used. otherwise, the absolute position of music files is stored.</seg>
<seg id="1218">To keep the current piece visible when changing the piece, the playlist window will pop up / down to keep the current piece in the visible window area.</seg>
<seg id="1219">When changing parts to the context browser, the context browser automatically displays the context browser as soon as the next piece is played.</seg>
<seg id="1220">In the Appearance section you can customize & Amarok; s Appearance. the section is subdivided into three parts.</seg>
<seg id="1221">In the font section, you can set the use of various fonts in & Amarok. by selecting Own fonts, the otherwise grey set section is enabled. you can select fonts for the following range: playlist windows, player windows and context browser. press select..., so you can select a desired font from the selection dialog.</seg>
<seg id="1222">With the Select color scheme, you have the choice of choice and can set your own color scheme. use the color selector activated below for foreground and background color.</seg>
<seg id="1223">Resume playback causes & Amarok; after program start, resume play automatically with the piece at the place where it was stopped at the last stop.</seg>
<seg id="1224">The On-Screen display allows you to switch on the OSD. when using on-screen display, a preview of the OSD is displayed and you can view the effect of all settings in this preview directly.</seg>
<seg id="1225">The first option is the font. click Select... to select from the dialog the desired font for the OSD. the check box shadow causes the text to be shaded in the OSD.</seg>
<seg id="1226">Using your own colors gives you the option to customize the OSD colors for font and background. clicking on the color areas opens the dialog to choose color. if you use colors not checked, the preset & kde colors will be used.</seg>
<seg id="1227">The display text input field displays the text displayed in the OSD. by entering placeholders, the OSD can be adjusted to your own needs. below is a list of available placeholders and what they mean.</seg>
<seg id="1228">The screen option is intended for Xinerama users, so you can specify on which screen of a multi-monitor environment the OSD should appear.</seg>
<seg id="1229">The card audio output lets you select an audio driver from the drop-down box. some drivers still activate more adjustment possibilities in this card card.</seg>
<seg id="1230">The collection card collection is used to set all settings for your collection. this includes the folder and the type of the database for the collection.</seg>
<seg id="1231">Here you can select the folder, the & Amarok; search for music files. to include a folder in the collection, select the check box next to its name. this section also contains check boxes to insert, how to proceed with the selected folders.</seg>
<seg id="1232">Browse subfolders recursively: this causes & Amarok; both the selected and their subfolders will be searched for music.</seg>
<seg id="1233">Monitor changes: enables & Amarok; to monitor the selected folders on changes (e.g. if music files are added or deleted). an incremental search is also carried out to make the necessary changes to your collection.</seg>
<seg id="1234">Import playlists: causes & Amarok; add all found playlists to your collection folders (.pls- and .m3u files) to your collection. the automatically added playlists will appear later in the playlist browser.</seg>
<seg id="1235">The part collection database is used to select a database for the collection. the combination field driver: lets you choose between SQLite or MySql. if MySql is selected, further setup is necessary in the MySql subwindow.</seg>
<seg id="1236">The MySql setup section is used to set up the database for & Amarok. under computer: enter the host on which the MySql database is located. after that, the network port is entered under which the database is accessible. name: is the database name to which the connection is established.</seg>
<seg id="1237">Use Username: and Password: to enter the data you need to connect to the database.</seg>
<seg id="1238">The last.fm card card supports the support for last.fm. & Amarok; can transmit the names of played pieces to a last.fm server and create music recommendations regarding the current piece if required.</seg>
<seg id="1239">Here you enter your user name and password for your Last.fm profile. if you do not have a profile, you can register on the last.fm website.</seg>
<seg id="1240">Send played pieces and so update the profile: this setting allows it & Amarok; to transmit the names of the played pieces to your last.fm profile.</seg>
<seg id="1241">Retrieve similar performers: after activating this setting, you can retrieve a list of similar performers to the played piece. you can view the list in the context browser. note: you do not need a last.fm profile to use this function.</seg>
<seg id="1242">& Amarok; is an audio player for Unix systems (such as & zb; Linux). for more information, see the summary of the functions and the gallery with screenshots.</seg>
<seg id="1243">Amarok only needs the package kdelibs and otherwise no other KDE packages. you have to have kdelibs so installed (including the included programs, because & Amarok; requires some of them to find e.g. modules or scripts). we have written a small guide how to build kdelibs minimally.</seg>
<seg id="1244">Some features such as the OSD require your window manager to keep the relevant standards of freedesktop.org. Gnome will work, but fluxbox will work for example. we try to support Amarok on all platforms, so we use kdelibs and Qt because they provide an excellent development environment.</seg>
<seg id="1245">Probably one of your files will make an error in the TagLib library. you can locate the file by scanning in ~ / .kde / share / apps / Amarok / collection _ scan.log. please report this error to the Taglib developers at bugs.kde.org and also append the broken file that caused the crash.</seg>
<seg id="1246">In most cases, it is because taglib crashes while reading the meta-info from this file. please report this error to the Taglib developers at bugs.kde.org.</seg>
<seg id="1247">If you use MySQL as a database, try SQLite. the support for this in & Amarok; is somewhat mature.</seg>
<seg id="1248">Make sure all of & Amarok; used libraries were compiled with the same compiler version. if e.g. & Amarok; with GCC 3.4, TagLib was compiled with GCC 3.3.X, then this leads to crashes when editing meta information.</seg>
<seg id="1249">If you use KDE with artsd, then disable automatic. turn off when inactive for... in setting up the sound system, or at least do not use any value of 1 second.</seg>
<seg id="1250">You can also send us the backtrace by e-mail (the e-mail opens automatically during a crash). if it is a frequent crash and you send us a good backtrace, the error will be fixed.</seg>
<seg id="1251">This is because many programs write data as UTF-8 into the meta-info, but don't label it as Unicode. the following Perl script fixes the problem.</seg>
<seg id="1252">#! / usr / bin / perl the "The file $ARGV [0] does not exist" unless -f $ARGV [0]; my $v2tag = $mp3- &gt; get _ v2tag; print "Error in writing the tags of $ARGV [0]\" unless $mp3- &gt; set _ v2tag ($v2tag, amp; UTF8);</seg>

<seg id="1254">& Amarok; s symbols in the status bar (random mode / repeat / dynamic playlist) are always active in KDE 3.4.0. sometimes the symbol effects are easily forgotten. note that in some cases you have to click on a icon for up to three times until this setting shows its effect.</seg>
<seg id="1255">If you get this error: amarokapp: symbol lookup error: amarokapp: undefined symbol: _ ZN11KSystemTray9setpixmap, then check if Amarok uses the correct Qt library. this can be viewed with ldd'which amarokapp '_ BAR _ grep qt.</seg>
<seg id="1256">To fix this error, you may need to remove any colliding Qt version or modify / etc / ld.so.conf to find the correct version first.</seg>
<seg id="1257">There are some possibilities. most installation problems are most easily resolved by the help of an expert for your Unix or Linux distribution. you can also search for help with other users or developers. use the forum and IRC under irc.freenode.net in the channel # Amarok.</seg>
<seg id="1258">Bugzilla is not suitable for help. please enter there only one error if you find something about fixing a bug in Amarok itself.</seg>
<seg id="1259">After the start of & Amarok, only a blank playlist appears. how do music pieces enter there now?</seg>
<seg id="1260">This is simple. use the file browser on the left and open the desired folder. then drag the files to the right part of the playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1261">In order to keep the surface intuitively, the Start subwindow was converted into the Statistics window. you can find it under Extras Statistics.</seg>
<seg id="1262">The meaning of these symbols has changed with Amarok 1.4 Fast Forward: stars stand for the rating by the user while the points are automatically calculated.</seg>
<seg id="1263">To evaluate pieces, the rating column must be displayed in the playlist. click on the playlist of the playlist and select column Show rating. click anywhere in the new review column to specify the rating for a piece. you can also use the short commands Windows + [1-5]. this also works when Amarok is in the background.</seg>
<seg id="1264">Select the files you want to remove and then press Del on your keyboard. or click with the right mouse button on your selection and then select From Playlist Remove from the drop-down menu.</seg>

<seg id="1269">No! yes, that's true! no! & Amarok; uses a backend independent approach, so the real question must be What media types support GStreamer / xine / Arts / NMM / MAS / KDEmm?. as you can see, we support almost any imaginable audio format.</seg>
<seg id="1270">It can! maybe you will use Fedora / Red Hat Linux, which will not include MP3 decoder in default (for patent reasons). the solution: Alt-F2, gg: RedHat mp3 kde, Enter key</seg>
<seg id="1271">Start the YaST Online Update and install the 'Multimedia Option Pack 1'. well... & Amarok; play MP3's from: -)</seg>
<seg id="1272">When using the GStreamer driver with the Alsa sink, the device must deliver a mixer. a mixer enables multiple applications to use the device at the same time and simultaneously output audio. this can be achieved through a sound card with hardware mixer (e.g. SBLive) or through the dmix module for Alsa (software mixer).</seg>
<seg id="1273">The output of this command should help you find the problem cause and a solution. for GStreamer you may need to specify another sink (e.g. osssink).</seg>
<seg id="1274">Do not forget that media must be decoded first. you can not simply send an MP3 to ALSA, you would only listen to a white noise. GStreamer is the best choice for most people if you are looking for a decoder with little overhead. GStreamer reads the file, decodes it and sends the PCM data to ALSA. just like XMMS.</seg>
<seg id="1275">XMMS also decodes the data first. GStreamer can output directly to ALSA, just like xine.</seg>
<seg id="1276">Use either the GStreamer driver (really great!) or optimize the settings of Arts. open Control Center Sound & Multimedia Sound System. enable sound server with highest possible priority (real-time priority) and increase the size of sound buffer (warning, see next point of the FAQ!). make sure artswrapper SUID is set:</seg>
<seg id="1277">With KDE 3.2.x there are problems with KDEmultimedia codecs that can cause disturbed playback. read this error report. enlarging the sound buffer in your ALSA setting file .asoundrc can also help well.</seg>
<seg id="1278">Either do not use the Arts Driver, but instead use GStreamer or xine, or install KDE multimedia to get the faster Arts codecs (libarts _ mpeglib.so & etc;).</seg>
<seg id="1279">Use another driver (the xine driver has been strongly optimized for Analyzer), or decrease the size of the Arts buffer in control center and sound & multimedia, sound system.</seg>
<seg id="1280">GStreamer is installed, but if I want to switch to the GStreamer driver, crashes & Amarok; ex. why?</seg>
<seg id="1281">After installing GStreamer, you need to register all components. follow the follow-up register to register all the GStreamer components.</seg>
<seg id="1282">Read the GStreamer FAQ. if that doesn't help, you can also ask the IRC channel # GStreamer.</seg>
<seg id="1283">Try this (quit Amarok before!): - Download and install ffmpeg, compile and install it. then run all ffmpeg files in the GStreamer module folder (you will find the module folder with the latest-config / GStreamer-config) and execute the follow-up list again.</seg>

<seg id="1332">If you install these packages via a package management system (e.g. RPM or apt), you also need to install the development versions of these packages!</seg>
<seg id="1333">& Amarok; is a versatile multimedia player. it offers many different ways to keep your music collection under control. as any normal multimedia player has also & Amarok; however, a playlist that is superior to all others.</seg>
<seg id="1334">This chapter explains how to use all the functions of & Amarok, including creating a collection and a playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1335">The Player Window is your one-click & Amarok; control center. at the top of the window there is a running text display showing the current piece or current stream. just below is the area, the playing time, bit rate and samplerate of the current play. a click on this area changes the display of the already expired playing time for the remaining play time of the piece.</seg>
<seg id="1336">In addition, the player window contains a selection of audio analyzers, even under the run text display. you can change through the available analyzers by clicking the left mouse button on the area.</seg>
<seg id="1337">The & Amarok; -Analyzer can be disconnected from the Player window. press d on your keyboard and the current analyzer is shown in an independent, magnifiable window.</seg>
<seg id="1338">The PL and EQ buttons are also displayed under the scroll display. the PL button activates or deactivates the playlist window while the EQ button is used to set up equalizers.</seg>
<seg id="1339">The rest of the player window consists of the playback buttons, the volume control and the play position slider. use the sliders to adjust the play position or volume. with the playback buttons you can start / stop playback and move to the next or previous piece.</seg>
<seg id="1340">Using the built-in equalizer is simple and works with all audio drivers. there are 17 presets from classic to techno, and you can easily create your own presets.</seg>
<seg id="1341">To view the equalizer, use Tools Equalizer from the main menu or click the EQ button in the player window. once you select the equalizer box, the equalizer is in operation.</seg>
<seg id="1342">The playlist of & Amarok; is the most advanced playlist of all for & kde; available multimedia players. it has many features that are not available in any other player.</seg>
<seg id="1343">The playlist window can be divided into two main areas, on the left side is the navigation pane. in the navigation pane you will find some of the excellent features of the playlist, such as the context browser. on the right hand side is the playlist itself. the playlist is easy to use and yet even for advanced users Powerful enough.</seg>
<seg id="1344">The context browser displays various information regarding the current play. its appearance can be customized with the help of context browser designs. the context browser contains three subwindows: music, text and performer. these three subwindows will be explained later in detail.</seg>
<seg id="1345">If you have already used earlier versions of & Amarok, you might notice that the subwindow has dropped off. the information displayed there has now been distributed to other parts of & Amarok. furthermore, the information in the Statistics window can be viewed (Extras Statistics).</seg>
<seg id="1346">The music subwindow shows information about the currently running piece, as well as the interpreter and the album.</seg>
<seg id="1347">The first section in this subwindow displays information about the piece. in the title is the name of the piece, artist and album. below you can see the cover picture of the album and a MusicBrainz icon next to it. click on this icon to look up the piece in the MusicBrainz database.</seg>
<seg id="1348">Below the MusicBrainz symbol you will find more information about the current piece. you can see here how often and when the piece was played for the first and last time as well as its evaluation.</seg>
<seg id="1349">In order to display cover images in the context browser, the cover images must be in the same folder as the current piece. the images can have any names, but pictures with the word 'front in the name are treated preferentially. the context browser will also display cover images, which are either downloaded with the cover administration or embedded in ID3v2 tags.</seg>
<seg id="1350">The next section, Recommended pieces, lists several recommended pieces. if you click on any of these pieces, it will be played immediately.</seg>
<seg id="1351">Under the Recommended pieces you find the favourite pieces of this artist. this area shows the five highest rated pieces of the current interpreter.</seg>
<seg id="1352">You can specify which information to be displayed in the music subwindow. right-click anywhere in the subwindow and select from the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="1353">The last section, albums of the artist, lists all the albums of the current performer that you have in your collection. if you click on an album, it will work out and you see the album's content.</seg>
<seg id="1354">You can click on all the pieces in the individual fields to start playing immediately. you can also click on it with the right mouse button and then select one of the options to add the play or album to the playlist from the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="1355">This function is very flexible and it is possible to download text from other web pages with the help of self-written scripts. as soon as you click on the text subwindow, try to download the text for the piece from the Internet. if no text script is running, you can choose which to start.</seg>
<seg id="1356">The Edit button allows you to edit the lyrics. the changed version is then stored in & Amarok; s collection database. no running text script is required.</seg>
<seg id="1357">The Search button opens a search on google.com after the song text for the running piece (in an external browser window).</seg>
<seg id="1358">Grouping interprets - only group the top level, each piece is displayed directly below the interpreter. albums or genres are ignored.</seg>
<seg id="1359">Grouping Artist / Album - First the pieces are arranged according to the artist and below is a further distribution according to the respective album. if you want to see compositions or soundtrack albums, this is the best view on your collection - these albums are displayed at the beginning of the list with different performers.</seg>
<seg id="1360">Group Interpret / Year - Album - Sorted by artist and then after the year of the album in descending order (latest first). if the year is unknown for an album, the default 0 - Albumname is used.</seg>
<seg id="1361">Grouping Album - All albums of your collection are sorted alphabetically by each other. the artist is ignored.</seg>
<seg id="1362">Grouping genre / interpreter - your pieces will first be sorted by genre and among them by artist.</seg>
<seg id="1363">Grouping Genre / Artist / Album - This setting works just like the above, but is also sorted according to album below the interpreter.</seg>
<seg id="1364">With the help of the remaining buttons you can customize and combine the grouping at will.</seg>
<seg id="1365">With the last button you can change the settings to the collection. note: & Amarok; will automatically capture your collection once you change something at the selected folders. if you own many pieces, it might take a while.</seg>
<seg id="1366">There is a search filter directly below the toolbar. it behaves in the list view as well as in the tree view. notes on how to use this filter can be found in the section on the playlist in this manual.</seg>
<seg id="1367">Under the search filter you will find a selection field with which help you can filter the recently added pieces to your collection. you can also choose between the last 24 hours up to a year. furthermore, you can of course select your entire collection, so that the filter is shut down practically.</seg>
<seg id="1368">By clicking with the right mouse button on an entry in the collection browser, you will receive the following options.</seg>
<seg id="1369">Load - This displays the current playlist and inserts the selected pieces in the currently valid order in the playback.</seg>
<seg id="1370">Append to Playlist - Adds the selected pieces to the current playlist. double-clicking on an entry brings the same effect.</seg>
<seg id="1371">Set pieces in queue - This function adds the selected pieces to the queue. this will play you next.</seg>
<seg id="1372">Save as a playlist... - Save the selected pieces as a playlist. you will be asked for a name under which the list should be stored.</seg>
<seg id="1373">Transfer to media player - Adds the pieces into the queue to transfer to the media player. for more details, see the Media Player browser section.</seg>
<seg id="1374">All pieces of this interpreter are burned / Burn to CD - This allows the selected pieces to be sent to K3b and burned either as a data or as audio CD. if K3b is not installed, this option is not displayed.</seg>
<seg id="1375">Edit Metadata (for n pieces)... - open the dialog for piece information and lets you change the tags for one or more pieces.</seg>
<seg id="1376">(s) Move files to the trash bin... - Open a confirmation dialog. if you confirm this, the selected files will be deleted from your computer.</seg>
<seg id="1377">Mark as a compilation - Select the selected album as a compilation, whereupon it appears under different interpreters.</seg>
<seg id="1378">Raising the compilation mark - Changes a compilation of the selected album back into a normal album. after that, the album is no longer displayed under different performers but again under the respective interpreter.</seg>
<seg id="1379">The playlists browser makes it easy to deal with many playlists. among other things, it also includes Smart Playlists.</seg>
<seg id="1380">The lower part of the playlist browser contains the smart playlists. these utilise & Amarok; s built-in database to automatically create some useful playlists at runtime. the smart playlists consist of:</seg>
<seg id="1381">Never played: a playlist with the pieces in your collection that have never been played.</seg>
<seg id="1382">Even created smart playlists are possible. click to add smart playlist to open the dialog to create a new Smart playlist, where you can enter all the necessary criteria for your new playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1383">The media player subwindow is used for the connection of & Amarok; for example, to use your iPod with & Amarok; for example, it must be included before the start of & Amarok; in / mnt / ipod. if & Amarok; start, you will find the pieces on your iPod to interpret sorted in the top list view of the Media Player browser.</seg>
<seg id="1384">To transfer pieces to your iPod, drag the desired titles from the playlist and let them fall on the list Artist. if you are done, click Apply. this will upload the pieces to your iPod. if the transmission is completed, quit & Amarok; and solve the drive binding for your iPod.</seg>
<seg id="1385">Among the toolbar is a search area with which you can search for a file. the search is especially useful in folders with very many files because in the file list all files are hidden, which do not match your search criteria.</seg>
<seg id="1386">In the lower part of the file browser there is an address bar with which you can fetch music from a entered URL. if you enter for example tar: / home / mike / musik.tar.gz and press enter key, you can access music in the file musik.tar.gz. now you can drag the music from there into the playlist and drop.</seg>
<seg id="1387">If the playlist is longer than in the window, the attachment of files can be difficult by simply dropping files. in this case, holding down the Shift key can be helpful: by doing so, dropped files will be inserted automatically at the end of the list, and not at the mouse position.</seg>
<seg id="1388">You can change the order by simply drag the entries to the desired position by simply drag the entries into the desired position. once you enter letters there will only be the pieces containing the letters. to reset the filter, press the back button for so long, until the text field is empty again.</seg>
<seg id="1389">If you enter separated search terms by whitespace, & Amarok; search for entries containing all search terms. for example, if you enter one in two, search will find all entries containing one, two and three.</seg>
<seg id="1390">If you enter the OR search terms, search for entries that contain either one or the other search term. example: one OR 2 OR Three. in this example, all pieces contain one or two or three (or a combination thereof).</seg>
<seg id="1391">If you want to search for entries containing spaces, then enclose the search term with goose feet: Mike Oldfield. this will search for entries that Mike Oldfield contains, but not according to entries like Mike J. Oldfield.</seg>
<seg id="1392">If you specify a particular search column, you may also search for larger or smaller ones. for example: rating: &gt; 50. This searches for pieces that have a higher rating than 50.</seg>
<seg id="1393">If you want to search for a piece that does not contain a particular search term, set a minus sign in front of the search term: -some search for pieces that do not contain anything.</seg>
<seg id="1394">You can combine these syntax variants at will. example: Mike Oldfield OR score: &gt; 50 -comment: bad. this searches for all pieces that contain either Mike Oldfield or a higher rating than 50 and do not contain the comment.</seg>
<seg id="1395">You can specify the sequence of entries by holding down the Ctrl key and clicking the right mouse button in the desired order. the entries then receive a label with a number. the number corresponds to the order in which the pieces are played.</seg>
<seg id="1396">The toolbar of the playlist is located at the bottom of the window. it contains buttons for some functions of the playlist. on the left, you will find the Add button to add to the playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1397">Next, the buttons will follow back and restore, so you can undo or restore any changes to the playlist.</seg>

<seg id="1476">If this is checked, a small bar is displayed at the bottom of the window. it contains information about the status of & k3b; and its activities. if this is not checked, the status bar is hidden.</seg>
<seg id="1477">The folder view includes an overview of your folders and CD / DVD drives. if the contents view is enabled, their contents will be displayed in the table of contents. CD / DVD drives also have a context menu with functions such as media info, locks and unlock the drive or ejection of the medium.</seg>
<seg id="1478">The table of contents enables selecting and dragging files into the project view. the table of contents is also the interface to read audio or video CDs if a drive has been selected with a corresponding CD / DVD in the folder view.</seg>
<seg id="1479">The head strip is a narrow area that is only visible when the project view contains open projects. the headline does not have a real function, it only looks pretty and separates the projection view clearly from the rest of the views.</seg>
<seg id="1480">This opens a dialog window to modify the key assignments for & k3b. after selecting one of the available commands in the upper part, you can adjust the key assignments for it further down.</seg>
<seg id="1481">This will start the k3b; setup wizard. this allows you to set the correct authorizations for burning CDs and DVDs. therefore, you need to enter the password for the system administrator (root) when the wizard is started.</seg>
<seg id="1482">Opens the settings of & k3b; here general program settings can be done. almost all functions of & k3b; should work at startup. this dialog is intended for personalising and fine adjustment of the program.</seg>
<seg id="1483">& k3b; is, like many other & knot; applications also equipped with a & DCOP interface. with the help of this interface, parts of the functionality can be controlled for example via a shell script.</seg>
<seg id="1484">To use the & DCOP functions, you can either use the command line program dcop, or the more convenient program Kdcop. both programs are identical in the range of functions, so your taste and type of task is critical, which of the contributor programs give you a preference.</seg>
<seg id="1485">In this chapter, we assume that you use the command line program dcop. to use the & DCOP functions, you must first make sure that & k3b is started. then enter something like the following at the console:</seg>
<seg id="1486">Besides the general & DCOP; functions that all & kde; program have in common, supported & k3b; mainly two additional parts described below.</seg>
<seg id="1487">The Standard DCOP interface of & k3b provides features such as copycd, format DVD and other functions for creating new projects.</seg>
<seg id="1488">DCOPRef createVideo DVDProject () DCOPRef createVideo DVDProject () DCOPRef createVideo DVDProject () DCOPRef createVideo DVDProject () void formatDvd () void burnCdImage () void burndimage () void burndimage (KURL url) void burndimage (KURL url)</seg>
<seg id="1489">As a result of such a createXXXProject method you get a DCOP reference to the newly created project: DCOPRef (k3b, K3bProject-0) Alternatively you can create a project using the command line: # k3b --audiocde and then get a reference to the project using # dcop k3b K3bInterface currentProject By using this reference it is possible to modify the project via K3bProjectInterface.</seg>
<seg id="1490">K3b offers the above K3bProjectInterface and the powerful K3bDataProjectInterface, which can only be applied to data projects (CD and DVD):</seg>
<seg id="1491">Void CreateFolder (Qstring name) void addUrls (Qstring name, Qstring parent) void addurls (Qstring path) void renameItem (Qstring path, Qstring NewName) void setVolumeID (Qstring id)</seg>
<seg id="1492">This makes it possible to fill out a data project with files and folders from a script. for example, the following script creates a data project, several folders and then inserts files into the new folder:</seg>
<seg id="1493">#! / bin / bash PROJECT = $(dcop k3b K3b interface createDataCDProject) dcop $PROJECT createFolder foo dcop $PROJECT createFolder bar / foo dcop $PROJECT addUrl / home / trueg / somefile.txt / foo / bar</seg>
<seg id="1494">& kaudiocreator; is an audio CD; -lesbian for & kde;. with it can easily be read audio CD; s can be read and stored in MP3 or OGG files. also other formats are possible, depending on encoder that is installed on the machine.</seg>
<seg id="1495">& kaudiocreator; is the interface of cdparanoia (for reading & CD; data in WAV files on hard disk) and by many encoders that encodes these WAV files (these encoders must still be installed from the Linux distribution). more encoders can be added to the program (if they have been installed).</seg>
<seg id="1496">First the titles of the & CD; read out and stored in WAV files on the computer (lossless and compressed); and then</seg>
<seg id="1497">In a second step these WAV files (usually one per title) are compressed into the mp3 or OGG format or in other formats like the lossless FLAC.</seg>
<seg id="1498">For the first step, reading the & CD;, is used by & kaudiocreator; cdparanoia. almost every distribution has compiled a pre-compiled package; if this is not yet installed, this needs to be done now.</seg>
<seg id="1499">For the second step, lame (for MP3), oggvorbis (for OGG) or other encoders must be installed. all these programs are usually installed for any Linux distributions, so it is very likely not necessary to install something yourself.</seg>
<seg id="1500">Which coding / file format should be used? the chapter Welcher Kodierer gives a small introduction about encoders, audio quality and compression factors.</seg>
<seg id="1501">A word to copy protected audio CD; s: as already said, used & kaudiocreator; cdparanoia to read the audio data from the & CD; if not the firmware of the & CD; / DVD device can handle protection, it is not possible to bypass any copyrighted audio CD; just avoid buying copied audio CD; s!</seg>
<seg id="1502">While setting up only needs to be done once (the setup dialog can be called up so often until a suitable configuration is found), the daily handling for reading a & CD will be explained. this (hopefully) leads to an understanding of the lean approach of the user interface that you frequently stumble across at the beginning.</seg>
<seg id="1503">Can convert into many formats - depending on which encoders are installed (MP3, OGG, FLAC & etc;)</seg>
<seg id="1504">Can & CD; get information from the freedb from the internet or can work completely without a network, with everything being manually collected.</seg>
<seg id="1505">This is just a short list of the main window commands. step by step, for example, you will find more information about how this program is used, as well as screen photos with descriptions of the tabs for configuring the program.</seg>
<seg id="1506">Starts the CDDB request of the CD data according to the setup of request in the CDDB tab. (this may be local or online, in the latter case the connection to the Internet must first be established.)</seg>
<seg id="1507">Start reading and - if a encoder has been configured in the Device Code tab - encoding.</seg>
<seg id="1508">Opens a sub-menu with a list of available encoders so that the selection can be read with another encoder when the default configuration dialog is configured.</seg>
<seg id="1509">Opens the file manager so that an already selected file will be selected for encoding instead of a full & CD; read and code.</seg>
<seg id="1510">Opens the setup dialog to configure the type of notification (such as logs, spades) for program events (such as reading the & CD; finished).</seg>
<seg id="1511">Opens the main setup dialog from & kaudiocreator; with different card cards (such as Encoder, for setting up the encoder). here you have to go before the program can be used successfully!</seg>
<seg id="1512">This chapter describes audio quality, encoders and compression ratios and helps you choose the right encoding.</seg>
<seg id="1513">If no audio information is to be lost, a lossless audio format is required. besides FLAC there are also other like 'shorten' or 'monkey' that may be available for this distribution. the disadvantages are the low compression rates and hardly available commercial devices that can play these files.</seg>
<seg id="1514">Among the audio formats that lose information through data compression according to their psychoacoustic model, MP3 and OGG are the most common. OGG may today have a slight advantage over MP3 in audio quality at lower bitrates (up to 128 kbps), but above this bitrate, the differences are less important since both encoders produce very good audio quality.</seg>
<seg id="1515">O 'not so' free, lame will still be supplied with most distributions for free, but there are open license questions</seg>
<seg id="1516">+ high to very high sound quality (at high bitrates), but compared to OGG slightly deeper quality at lower bitrates.</seg>
<seg id="1517">OGG - if only music is to be heard from a computer or a computer based music system and / or if one of the few existing OGG playsets exists.</seg>
<seg id="1518">MP3 - if music is also to be listened to on other devices, such as standard DVD players, portable devices (USB stick, memory card, hard disk) or special auto stereo systems. today - initially 2009 - these devices usually only support MP3 format.</seg>
<seg id="1519">A short list of parameters for audio quality and the resulting compression ratios for 'lame' (MP3s) (see 'lame --help' for more parameters):</seg>
<seg id="1520">'--preset medium '= This setting gives good transparency for most people and most of the music</seg>
<seg id="1521">'--preset standard '= this setting should usually offer acceptable transparency for most people and most music pieces, and has quite high quality. good enough for hi-fi stereo systems with high quality.</seg>
<seg id="1522">'--preset extreme '= 224 to 256 kbps VBR, compression rate up to 6.3. needs up to 320 kbps for complex music pieces and a little less for less complex parts of the piece. good enough for hi-fi stereo systems with high quality. this is the preferred choice.</seg>
<seg id="1523">'--preset extreme -b 256 '= 256 kbps CBR, compression rate around 5.5. requires always 256 kbps for complex and less complex pieces of a title. some older devices need CBRs. good enough for hi-fi stereo systems with high quality.</seg>
<seg id="1524">'-h' = 128 kbps CBR common stereo, compression rate around 11. 128 kbps for all songs of a title. good enough for music of young people, portable devices and autostereos. but not good enough for better HiFi stereo systems.</seg>
<seg id="1525">'--preset Insane '= 320kbps CBR. this setting will be overdone for most people and most environments, but if you absolutely want to have the absolutely highest quality without regard to the file size, then choose this setting.</seg>
<seg id="1526">The & CD; information retrieved manually or automatically fetched from the freedb via the Internet are available in the program as a list of parameters. you can hand over / use with & kaudiocreator; and the encoding program to create the folder and file names as well as the properties of the music files.</seg>
<seg id="1527">In connection with coding programs, there is often a combination of program settings for the encoders and these parameters here. the manual or the help to the encoders explain the switches for these programs.</seg>
<seg id="1528">For example to add the & CD; Title to the keywords (English: day) if MP3s are encoded with lame, the switch -tt from lame and the title parameter of & kaudiocreator must be added. the result looks like '... -tt {title}...'.</seg>
<seg id="1529">This is a summary of & kaudiocreator; parameters that can be used (= button identifier in the wizard):</seg>
<seg id="1530">This is what the freedb is: a free database where people can read the audio CDs that can download information instead of entering the computer. it is to be noted that only text is spoken: & CD; Title, Artist, Name of the pieces & etc;, not from the audio file itself.</seg>
<seg id="1531">Yes, it should be legal, but I (note of the translator) am not a lawyer. however, no one can prevent that you from the & CD; information released publicly on CD; more or less worthless, so neither the artist nor the music company can be harmed. all information can be obtained anyway with a stroll through a & CD; business, physical or virtual.</seg>
<seg id="1532">In & kaudiocreator; is actively to select a check box (sending an address). in this mode of configuration, it seems, the email address is not used when retrieving the data from the server (This can only know the programmer who has verified the code.)</seg>
<seg id="1533">There are copies of the main database in many countries. if & kaudiocreator; to use freedb, the geographically closest mirror server is to be used. this saves bandwidth in the network and balances the load between the hosts.</seg>
<seg id="1534">A visit to freedb.org provides a current list of mirror servers for the online retrieval of & CD; information during reading a & CD; alternatively the complete database can be downloaded or (usually created monthly) only the updates of the database.</seg>
<seg id="1535">Which reading program is used to store plays from the & CD; in WAV files on my computer?</seg>
<seg id="1536">There are rumors that cdparanoia is used; if you want to know more precisely, look for the source code.... This has always been the best choice for reading audio CD; s. note that the cdparanoia package must first be installed from the appropriate distribution if this has not happened yet.</seg>
<seg id="1537">To save the read WAV files, the encoder and the desired file format can be selected. the first opening contains predefined entries for lame (MP3s), oggenc (Oggs) and FLAC (a lossless compression for audio data) on the encoder tab. other encoders can be added on this tab.</seg>
<seg id="1538">The encoder package must be installed by the Linux distribution concerned before the encoder can be used. this is also required for the predefined encoders. for more information on Kodierer, please refer to the chapter Welcher Kodierer.</seg>
<seg id="1539">After installing a encoder, you can get more information about your switch by entering a command such as lame -help or lame --help in a console window (eg; console).</seg>
<seg id="1540">This can have many causes. check the device name of the & CD; / DVD disk, write and write permission on it and whether both cdparanoia and the audio encoder of your choice (lame for MP3s, oggenc for Oggs, flac & etc;) are installed.</seg>
<seg id="1541">Check if you don't want a copy-protected audio CD; check out the envelope of the & CD; this will not succeed!</seg>
<seg id="1542">There is a chapter with a step by step example. even if you use other settings, this can give tips on how to proceed.</seg>
<seg id="1543">Have you read the complete manual, understood all, are somehow still unsure what to do? well, no problem, follow this step-by-step example, and you will get enough information to set up those areas that make the program exactly what you want.</seg>
<seg id="1544">In this example, we will launch the program for the first time, set up everything and read our first & CD; we will use lame '--preset extreme' to generate MP3s with a VBR (variable bitrate) from 224 to 256 kbps on average and ID3V1 keyword (tags).</seg>
<seg id="1545">There must be cdparanoia and lame already installed on your computer. both programs should be available as pre-compiled packages for your Linux distribution. for example, a suitable package for lame can be found with a search engine as it is not fully free software. anyway, it is not necessary to compile the source files, which you can always do.</seg>
<seg id="1546">Please make sure that the / usr / share / cd directory exists and that you have write permission (eg by trying to copy something inside with the konqueror).</seg>
<seg id="1547">The first section covers basic setup of & kaudiocreator; something that is probably done only once and</seg>
<seg id="1548">The second section describes how to read a & CD; what needs to be repeated for each CD;</seg>
<seg id="1549">Here we define the encoders to be used (lame) as well as the audio format (MP3) as well as the resulting sound quality (--preset extreme = &gt; VBR 224 to 256 kbps).</seg>
<seg id="1550">Although we can change these settings at any time, we will probably not change them on any read out of a & CD; change if once the appropriate settings are found.</seg>
<seg id="1551">The device name is passed to the selection program so it can read the & CD; -data / pieces.</seg>
<seg id="1552">Often / dev / cdrom is a symbolic link to the actual device identifier of your disk. if this does not work or if more than one & CD; / DVD drive is available, a look into the file / etc / fstab and an attempt with the existing entries of device designations for CD & CD-ROM; and / or DVD drives.</seg>
<seg id="1553">The tab General Settings. there is not much to do here. here an additional conversion can be defined. in our example, everything is displayed as shown in the screenshot.</seg>
<seg id="1554">Select only for incomplete information, so that you will be informed when information about creating keywords (tags) is missing.</seg>
<seg id="1555">The card card CD; Settings. simply select both entries. we are comfortable and let the & CD; data automatically download via the internet from a freedb calculator.</seg>
<seg id="1556">Note: the computer must be connected to the freedb server while reading the & CD.</seg>
<seg id="1557">The second selection field is easier, is a & CD; entry found, immediately starts reading the & CD; it is associated with low risk, if you are later unhappy with the database entry and the resulting directory names / filenames or tag entries, they can be easily changed. the directory or filename is changed with Konqueror - &gt; Rename, and the ID3 tags with Kid3, the & kde; Tagger.</seg>
<seg id="1558">Apart from this example, keep in mind: if you want to manually enter everything manually, disable the selection fields and freedb will not be used. however, this is over 620 MB big, consider this twice whether this is worth it. to use freedb in offline mode, the two selections must be selected, at least the first.</seg>
<seg id="1559">CDDB is freedb for us. these are settings for the data request, for retrieving the & CD; information from the freedb server over the Internet. how does the system know which data to get the CD? read the freedb section.</seg>
<seg id="1560">Mode: we did not download the database, we only want to work with the remote database on the Internet server.</seg>
<seg id="1561">CDDB server: please go to freedb.org and look for a mirror server close by. on this way, the load is distributed between the hosts. however, this setting will work as the first attempt.</seg>
<seg id="1562">Both function equivalent to the server, but since many firewalls are bocking the protocol 8880 by default, there might be more luck with the protocol 80, since the HTTP protocol is usually open to surf the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="1563">In this example, we don't want to transfer data to the freedb server. deactivate the first check box should suffice.</seg>
<seg id="1564">Just take the settings from the screenshot. (make sure the / tmp folder exists on your computer)</seg>
<seg id="1565">Number of simultaneously matching pieces: sorry, there is one reason why more than one at the same time with only one existing drive? parallel reading and coding? the author doesn't know, so simply try it yourself.</seg>
<seg id="1566">CD; discard after reading the last piece: check this to check the CD; at the end of the process.</seg>
<seg id="1567">Custom folder for temporary files: if you tick this, then / must be given the path / folder where the WAV files are stored. if the field is not checked, the files will be created in the private folder. do not forget this folder if you want to do something with the WAV files yourself.</seg>
<seg id="1568">Enter everything as it is on the screen shot. the command is a bit long, under certain circumstances something must be flattened to the right to see everything.</seg>
<seg id="1569">'--preset extreme' defines the audio quality of the MP3s. as mentioned before, this is sufficient for very good audio quality, even for very good hi-fi stereo systems. the resulting bitrate is about 224 to 256 kpbs. the achieved compression ratio is 6.3. this is a good balance between audio quality and memory consumption.</seg>
<seg id="1570">Note the '--id3v1-only' entry for restricting the creation of tags to V1 / V1.1. 'ID3v2' tags. Kid3 is an excellent 'id3' tag for & kde; in case of later change of tags.% f and% o are internal variables for the name of the input file (including the full path) and the output file (including the full path).</seg>
<seg id="1571">Set the rest as shown in the screenshot. some comments for future use outside of this example:</seg>
<seg id="1572">Number of simultaneously encoders to encoders: with a dual-core or quadcore or even a multiprocessor machine, it can be tried to encode more than one WAV file at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="1573">That's it, we've just finished the basic setup of & kaudiocreator; this configuration is used as a standard for each reading of a & CD; if you chose the organizational structure of your music wisely, you never need to change it again.</seg>
<seg id="1574">This section describes how the process of reading the & CD; runs on the hard disk. we will create MP3 files. the folder structure, the way the music is organized on the hard disk, is set up in the previous section. first, a connection to the internet is built, since we are comfortable and the & CD; data from the freedb must be retrieved.</seg>
<seg id="1575">Since we use a & CD which is not yet in freedb, the screenshots look a little different from the data collected by freedb. therefore, you will learn to enter the & CD; data manually instead of picking them out of the internet. comments will indicate the differences.</seg>
<seg id="1576">Don't try to find the & CD; this example is a 'special' edition of the author of this manual.</seg>
<seg id="1577">If this is not done yet, the & CD must now be inserted into the drive that was defined in the main window.</seg>
<seg id="1578">After a short moment, the pieces and their length should be listed in the window as shown in the screenshot. this only if the & CD; as an audio CD; could be identified and read by cdparanoia.</seg>
<seg id="1579">If this is not done, then browse the questions and answers section in the Help section or go back to the previous section regarding the basic settings.</seg>
<seg id="1580">Attention: if the CD; successfully fetched from the freedb, all tracks of the pieces are already filled and the name of the artist and the album are displayed.</seg>
<seg id="1581">In the event that there is more than one entry in the database with the 'unique' & CD; a window is displayed, and you can select the database entry that fits your opinion best to your & CD.</seg>
<seg id="1582">If you have not selected the check box for the automatic retrieval of freedb (on the page & CD; Settings dialog for Settings), you can also trigger this manually by selecting the first button in the toolbar. if you do not have a local database, but retrieve the data from the Internet, you need the connection to the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="1583">E 1.2 Step 02: the CD Editor - Input of the CD data and title of the first piece</seg>
<seg id="1584">Enter the data for your & CD; corresponding to the pattern on the next screen shot. the title of the piece in the first line of the input field 'Actual Title', the rest of the data in the input field 'Album'.</seg>
<seg id="1585">The artist no longer has to be entered in the Edit Title field, unless you have a collection of different artists for each piece.</seg>
<seg id="1586">The comment field below can be used for individual comments per piece, the comment field of the album is used for comments that are common to all pieces of the CD.</seg>
<seg id="1587">Note: following the successful retrieval of the freedb data, the CD editor is not empty, but it already contains the data as shown in the following screenshot. however, it is always a good idea to check the contents of the CD editor so that you are not only satisfied with the artist and album name (e.g. whether all words start with capital letters or not...), but also to check if there are any unwanted comments.</seg>
<seg id="1588">Note: in this example, we only use ID3v1 tags. this limits the length of the fields to 30 characters for the artist, album and title of a piece and to only 28 characters for the comment section. if you use ID3v2 tags, you have unlimited field length, at least on what & kaudiocreator; this option is set up on the encoder settings tab.</seg>
<seg id="1589">You can change the tag information of the generated files at any time using the Tag Editor. Kid3 is a good tool for MP3 files, with it you can also create ID3v2 tags.</seg>
<seg id="1590">Tags are not supported by all encoders or file formats. consult the encoder to get more information.</seg>
<seg id="1591">Simply select an entry that is obviously compatible with the style of the read-out CD. in this example, this is not important as we don't transmit the & CD; for more information go to freedb.org's web site and read the information on Categories. pop or Rap for example can be found under Rock.</seg>
<seg id="1592">After choosing 'OK' go back to the main window. just click on the line with the second piece.</seg>
<seg id="1593">The window of the CD Editor appears again and you see that the fields for the album are already filled with the entered data we have recorded for the first piece. simply enter the entries for the fields of the current piece. the title of the piece in any case and any other information you wish.</seg>
<seg id="1594">Click on the next line in the main window and proceed in the same way until you have entered all the title data of the & CD;</seg>
<seg id="1595">Attention: this window does not appear when you downloaded the data from the freedb. it is already sorted into one of these categories of the database.</seg>
<seg id="1596">It is the third button of the toolbar. note that the artist and the album are displayed on the parts list.</seg>
<seg id="1597">Note that there is a check mark in front of each line of a piece. only the titles that are selected are read out. a simple click on the line switches the selection of the piece one or off. make sure all pieces are selected, or press the All items button at the bottom of the screen to select all pieces at once.</seg>
<seg id="1598">By clicking on the button selection to read out the selection process, this window will appear to confirm. click OK and then we will take a look at the window with the orders and track what runs out.</seg>
<seg id="1599">Click on the tab order to switch to the order window. it is in the left upper half of the window, right under the buttons of the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="1600">This is the window to control the orders. the first piece is just read on the hard drive. the status of the program is displayed in the left lower part of the window in the status line.</seg>
<seg id="1601">This error message can be seen if you are trying to work with a code that you have not yet installed. pieces that have not been successfully decoded are marked with a red 'X' in the order list.</seg>
<seg id="1602">By the way, the folder for the TMP file and destination folders are not what we entered here in the example. did you check if you have write access to the folder for the temporary files and the destination folder?; -)</seg>
<seg id="1603">Now it is clear why the error occurred right after the end of the first piece.</seg>
<seg id="1604">The order 1 reads the first piece, it is finished. but we have a new entry: mission 4 is the encoding of piece 1 into the format MP3. thus, read out and code parallel. note the status message in the bottom part of the window, it is now improved.</seg>
<seg id="1605">The author of the program has not found a configuration setting to suppress this behavior. the only thing that seems configurable is the number of parallel processes to read and write. the computer used with a AMD64 seems to have no problem at simultaneous reading and encoding (from though two different pieces).</seg>
<seg id="1606">Now the last title is read while another piece is encoded and a third order placed in the queue of the encoder. after the last piece is encoded, a small window with a message is displayed for a short time in the upper left part of the window.</seg>
<seg id="1607">For the successful use of & kaudiocreator, you need & kde; 3.x. or 4.x and cdparanoia. if you want to create compressed audio files like MP3 or OGG, you need the encoder of your choice.</seg>

<seg id="1616">& kmid; is the MIDI- and karaoke player of & kde; besides others, he has real-time graphics and karaoke real-time highlighting of texts also some properties that other & UNIX; -MIDI players do not have.</seg>
<seg id="1617">& kmid; runs under & Linux; and FreeBSD. it builds on the OSS system, so it should work on all systems with OSS and & kde; support also support the & Linux; Ultrasound project driver needed for GUS cards. Alsa is included as soon as it supports a sequencer.</seg>
<seg id="1618">& kmid; displays the lyrics on the screen with changing color, so it's easy to follow the piece.</seg>
<seg id="1619">Graphical representation of the activity of each MIDI channel by highlighting the pressed buttons on the (virtual) keyboard.</seg>
<seg id="1620">Drag & Drop so that you can drag and drop each MIDI file from a & konqueror; windows to kmid.</seg>
<seg id="1621">Supports the two existing standards to store text into MIDI files (song events or text events).</seg>
<seg id="1622">Session support. if you finish & kde; while playing a song, kmid will start with the same song next time.</seg>
<seg id="1623">Supports external MIDI synthesizer, AWE, FM and GUS cards (for the latter you need the LUP driver and gusd).</seg>
<seg id="1624">First, you can select View... from the File menu. it appears the usual file dialog with which help you can select the desired song.</seg>
<seg id="1625">You can also drop a file from a & konqueror; -window to the & kmid; window. this also works with multiple songs simultaneously.</seg>
<seg id="1626">To play a piece of music, open it and press the Play button in the toolbar, select the play item from the menu item or press the space bar.</seg>
<seg id="1627">Please note that & kmid; one piece automatically starts as soon as you drag it to the & kmid; (with several pieces you will be added to a collection and then played one after the other.)</seg>
<seg id="1628">As soon as & kmid; a piece plays, you can jump to any place by using the middle mouse button and moving with the controller back and forth.</seg>
<seg id="1629">If you find that a song is played too fast or too slow, you can click on the left and right arrows of the speed display and thus change the playback speed. to get back the original tempo, double-click on the Tempo- LCD.</seg>
<seg id="1630">The space bar has two tasks: when a piece is played, a pressure on the space bar acts as a pressure on the button break or selecting the menu item Pause in the menu item, thus interrupts playback. pressing the space bar while no piece is played starts & kmid; playback.</seg>
<seg id="1631">Lyrics can be stored in two ways in one piece of music. some pieces use text event, others use lyrics event and others do both. some pieces have no text at all: -)</seg>
<seg id="1632">In & kmid, you can specify which events to be displayed and even better: the event type will automatically be determined using a song, so you do not have to manually set it up. so, if you select the automatic text selection in the Settings menu, the Karaoke Text will automatically be selected, but you still have the ability to change this if you want to see the other way.</seg>
<seg id="1633">If you want to set up an event type, select the text events and / or the song events from the Settings menu. the same function also has the keys 1 and 2.</seg>
<seg id="1634">A collection is a list of MIDI files that you summarize. in this section you will see how you can efficiently use collections.</seg>
<seg id="1635">To create a collection, first open the collection manager. you will find it in the menu collection under the point Organize.... Click here and enter the name for the collection.</seg>
<seg id="1636">You can also copy an existing collection by clicking on copy and then specifying the name for the new collection. at the beginning, this collection will contain the same songs as the original ones.</seg>
<seg id="1637">If you have more than one collection, you can select the each one you want in the collection manager.</seg>
<seg id="1638">The temporary collection contains all the songs you don't want to add to any other collection.</seg>
<seg id="1639">When exiting the application, this collection is not saved. remember that when you add a lot of pieces.</seg>
<seg id="1640">To add songs to a collection, it must be selected in the collection manager. there you can add a song with the Add button. it appears in turn the file dialog with which help you can select the desired song.</seg>
<seg id="1641">A second method to add a song depends on setting Automatic addition to the collection.</seg>
<seg id="1642">When automatic addition to the collection is enabled, a piece is automatically added to the active collection when opening (using File Open or Drag & Drop).</seg>
<seg id="1643">If auto add to the collection is not enabled, the temporary collection is activated and emptied when opening a piece. this collection will then be added to the newly opened pieces.</seg>
<seg id="1644">To remove a song from a collection, you must open the collection manager, select the collection and the desired song and then click on Delete.</seg>
<seg id="1645">You can select the order in which the songs will be played. if you select the series from the submenu Select sequence of the menu collections, the songs will be played in the order as they were added to the collection.</seg>
<seg id="1646">When you add or remove songs or select random order in the menu, the order is redefined.</seg>
<seg id="1647">To play a song, select it from the collection manager, or use the selection list above the karaoke text.</seg>
<seg id="1648">To skip a song, select the Next song button, the entry next song from the menu item or press the arrow to the right.</seg>
<seg id="1649">To jump back a song back, select the button Forward piece, the item Previous piece from the menu item or press the arrow left.</seg>
<seg id="1650">To delete a collection, open the collection manager, select the collection to be deleted and click the Delete button.</seg>
<seg id="1651">The temporary collection cannot be deleted. however, this does not matter as it is not saved when leaving & kmid.</seg>
<seg id="1652">This is absolutely necessary for synthesizers, which are not General MIDI-capable. in this case, the MIDI-map translates general MIDI events into events that the synthesizer understands.</seg>
<seg id="1653">For example, you can create a MIDI map that converts all events of the type Change patch to Bright Piano into events of the Change patch to Trumpet type, making a trumpet sound whenever a piano was originally supposed to play.</seg>
<seg id="1654">If you have only one sound card, you do not need a MIDI map, because all sound cards are GM compatible (including Awe and GUS cards, FM devices and so on).</seg>
<seg id="1655">There are no programs to create MIDI maps, so you have to edit the appropriate file by hand (with your favorite editor).</seg>
<seg id="1656">A MIDI map is a text file that stores all the necessary replacements for playing a piece.</seg>
<seg id="1657">Each section may only appear once, except the keymap section which may appear as often as desired. however, it is necessary that each occurrence has a different text ID (see below).</seg>
<seg id="1658">Define PATCHMAP... END Define Keymap "Name of the key map... END Define Keymap" A more Keymap... END Define CHANNELMAP... END OPTIONS... END</seg>
<seg id="1659">You see that Define is needed to indicate that a section starts (except for OPTIONS) and END that the end of a section is reached.</seg>
<seg id="1660">Please send me your map file as email so that I can offer in future versions of & kmid; support for devices that are not General MIDI compliant.</seg>
<seg id="1661">This section specifies how General MIDI can be mapped to your specific keyboard. general use looks like this:</seg>
<seg id="1662">Please note that the left side of the equal sign is ignored. it is assumed that the GM patches are in the correct order (from 0 to 127), so you must not change the order and leave no line for one of the 128 instruments.</seg>
<seg id="1663">The optional AllKeysTo M is used to place all sounds that this instrument needs to play on tone with number M. if your keyboard doesn't support a gun shot (GM-Patch 127), you can take a drum (e.g. with sound 60), which sounds similar to a gun shot. to do this, use the following in the PATCHMAP section:</seg>
<seg id="1664">So if a MIDI file is to play a note with Patch 127 (snapshot), it takes patch 100 (the drum on your keyboard) and plays the sound 60, regardless of which sound is in the MIDI file.</seg>
<seg id="1665">Please note that the term drum patch is meant to represent a different percussion instrument (drum, cymbal, maracas & etc;) and not the one in which the tone means the pitch of the same drum (as some keyboards possess).</seg>
<seg id="1666">The keymap section is used to specify how sounds are mapped on a specific channel or instrument. the use is:</seg>
<seg id="1667">As with the PATCHMAP section, the sequence of lines is very important, as well as its presence. you need to create 128 entries.</seg>
<seg id="1668">You can define several key maps for each channel and instrument. you only have to use different names in the first line.</seg>
<seg id="1669">Keyboards are used primarily to map notes on the percussion channel. see for example the included Keyboards.</seg>
<seg id="1670">This section can be used to map out some channels to others. for example, if you want to swap the first and second channel, just make it in the CHANNELMAP section.</seg>
<seg id="1671">However, these settings are useful for keyboards which have the percussion on a specific channel (General MIDI to Channel 10, others need channels 16 or 9).</seg>
<seg id="1672">MIDI devices need 16 channels, the CHANNELMAP section has 16 lines, numbered from 0 to 15, built according to the following pattern:</seg>
<seg id="1673">N is the channel that is shown on the channel N. if you use the Keymap option, the key map will be used with the name Name for that channel. if you use the ForcePatch option, all events will be ignored, which will try to change the patch on this channel. in this case patch x will always be used.</seg>
<seg id="1674">The ForcePatch flag can be useful for example to always use the percussions patch on the percussions channel.</seg>
<seg id="1675">If a MIDI file sends a pitch-Bender event with the value n, it is converted to the formula n * (r / 4096) and then relayed only. the value 4096 is used to prevent decimal commas in the map file.</seg>
<seg id="1676">This setting is needed because GM specifies that a keyboard, which receives a pitch-Bender event with the value 4096, is supposed to play a sound higher. unfortunately, however, some keyboards are trying to play two tones up to one octave higher. to find the right value on your keyboard you need to try a bit with & kmid; try it around.</seg>
<seg id="1677">To use a MIDI map, simply open the MIDI Settings dialog. this can be found in the menu under Settings, Point MIDI Settings</seg>
<seg id="1678">The channel view is a window with a whole series of keyboards (one for each MIDI channel). on these keyboards you see which sounds are being played straight.</seg>
<seg id="1679">You can also use the channel view to change the instrument on a specific channel. for each channel there is a selection list where you can select an instrument. if you have changed an instrument, the button lights no longer green but red to indicate that no longer the original instrument is used.</seg>
<seg id="1680">The channel view has (until now) two different views to view the played sounds. view the view in the Settings menu under the point channel view: settings</seg>
<seg id="1681">The speed LCD shows the speed at which a song is played. the higher the number, the greater the speed.</seg>
<seg id="1682">You can change the tempo of a song. for example, if you find a song too fast to follow the text, you can slow it down. to change the tempo, use the left and right arrows from the LCD.</seg>
<seg id="1683">A MIDI file is a file containing information about how to play a piece of music. it contains the notes, rhythm, speed, & etc; thus, the same MIDI file can lead to very different results on two different devices, just like two different musicians can play the same notes in a very different way.</seg>
<seg id="1684">Good, I can't force anyone to use & kmid; but a typical MIDI file needs about 50 KB, while a mp3 file needs 4 MB (a compression ratio of 1: 80) and with a good synthesizer you can also change the individual instruments, speed & etc; you have control over everything.</seg>
<seg id="1685">This can happen if you have a binary distribution (rpm, deb) of & kmid; that happens because & kmid, compiled without AWE support. to eliminate the problem you need to download and install a source distribution (for example from kmid; 's home page)</seg>
<seg id="1686">I want to add a whole folder to a collection, but I don't want to add all files individually.</seg>
<seg id="1687">Disagree, therefore support & kmid; Drag & Drop. simply open the folder you want to add in & konqueror;, select all files, and drag them to the & kmid; window.</seg>
<seg id="1688">By default, enable automatic addition to the collection. otherwise, the files will be added to the temporary collection.</seg>
<seg id="1689">You can press the arrow key left of the Tempo- LCD to slow playback. to restore the default tempo, you can double-click on the LCD.</seg>
<seg id="1690">I have an & konqueror; -Windows with my MIDI folder and & kmid; on this desktop (if I play a MIDI file) or attached (if I play a karaoke file), I only have to switch to the & konqueror; drag the desired file into the & kmid window.</seg>
<seg id="1691">If you want to listen to a file quickly, without adding them to a collection, turn off the setting Automatically add to the collection, and the new one; file will be added to the temporary collection. opening files</seg>
<seg id="1692">Let's assume you have the MIDI files A.mid, B.mid and C.mid. first you just want to play the first file. so set the setting Automatically add to the collection and open A.mid. your temporary collection then contains exactly this one MIDI file.</seg>
<seg id="1693">Then you decide to play B.mid and C.M. and create a collection with all three files. how do you do that?</seg>
<seg id="1694">These people sent me MIDI files or postcards. thank you very much! if I hear these songs or see the postcard, it encourages me to program on.</seg>
<seg id="1695">& kmid; was written by & Antonio.Larrosa.Jimenez; I study mathematics at the University of Maacute; Malaga. at the moment I'm studying mathematics at the University of Maacute; Malaga. at the moment I'm studying mathematics at the University of Maacute; I'm trying to take some time for my hobbies.</seg>
<seg id="1696">If you want to know where to download MIDI / karaoke files, if you have a question, an error or an idea for an extension of & kmid; or even if you just want to make me happy, write me an email: larrosa @ kde.org or antlarr @ arrais.es</seg>
<seg id="1697">You really make me a great joy when you send me a postcard from your home or a MIDI- / karaoke file from a local group. all of which send me a postcard or a MIDI file, I will list with friends of & kmid; but before you send a MIDI file, you should contact me because I might already have the file.</seg>
<seg id="1698">I have written & kmid; completely written in my spare time and won't get money from anyone for it. I would like to emphasize that I only want to programmatize because / when I get feedback from users (postcards or emails).</seg>
<seg id="1699">Takashi Iwai and Joseph H. BÃ¼hler - corrected the defect that the pitch of AWE cards was too high.</seg>
<seg id="1700">My thanks also goes to Jose Lus Sanchez for testing the GUS support, Ignacio Garcia for testing AWE support, Has Petter Bieker, Ola Sigurdson, Marc Diefenbruch, Peter Gritsch, Peter-Paul Witta, Thorsten Westheider, Ulrich Cordes and anyone who has sent me a patch, bug alert or even a supportive e-mail.</seg>
<seg id="1701">And of course, thanks also to all of these outstanding musicians on the net, who give us these wonderful MIDI- and karaoke files.</seg>
<seg id="1702">In addition, it can be found on its homepage, which is located under http: / / www.arrais.es / ~ rlarrosa / kmid.html. on the homepage you can follow the development, search for information and look at pictures. you will also find links to sites with other karaoke songs, & etc;</seg>
<seg id="1703">A sound card. I recommend you a good sound card or an external synthesizer, because the sound quality depends essentially on your sound card. it is not the same whether you use a FM radio or an AWE card.</seg>
<seg id="1704">If you don't have a sound card, you need to compile and compile with the MODE _ DEMO _ ONLYVISUAL parameter. it then runs as if you had a sound card except that you can of course not hear music.</seg>
<seg id="1705">If problems occur, contact one of the & kde; -Mailing Lists or send an error message directly to me.</seg>
<seg id="1706">& KMPlayer; is a simple interface for MPlayer, Phono and FFMPEG. the program is used to play video files supported by MPlayer or phonon supported formats, as well as for playback DVD s, VCD s or TV and camera.</seg>
<seg id="1707">The & kappname documentation; was not yet finished as & kde; installed on this computer.</seg>
<seg id="1708">For additional help, please check the page The KDE website for new versions, or send the question to The & kde; user mailing list.</seg>
<seg id="1709">The application window is made of so-called andockable windows. there is always the window with the central view. alternatively, there is the window with the playlist. and finally, there is an information window that will only be displayed when information is returned.</seg>
<seg id="1710">It is possible to save the preferred connections under the Bookmark menu, but these are individual entries. if you want to create a list of entries that are played after each other, you should use the category Permanent Playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1711">Of course you can add groups to groups to obtain an additional hierarchical level. if you click an entry, his group and all his subgroups will be copied to the current category and playback begins with the selected entry.</seg>
<seg id="1712">The categories' current play ', TV and permanent playlist can also be changed by editing XML configuration files. of course, you can only do this if & KMPlayer; not run through an editor, but also by the application itself. simply click on a name of a category, select from the View menu and see the next editing mode. by clicking a subgroup only the XML content of this part will be shown.</seg>
<seg id="1713">After modifying XML files, you must select the same playlist from the same menu and select either the edit mode or select another category.</seg>
<seg id="1714">All changes are lost when editing edit mode or selecting another group without matching the playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1715">Due to the convenience of the author of & KMPlayer, some functions can only be enabled by changing the XML configuration files.</seg>
<seg id="1716">The animation during starting and ending can be disabled by editing ~ / .kde / share / config / kmplayerc and modifying [General Options] No Intro = 0 obiger option on '1'. if the option is not available, it can be easily inserted.</seg>
<seg id="1717">It is also possible to activate another animation. & KMPlayer; note the files ~ / .kde / share / apps / KMPlayer / intro.xml and ~ / .kde / share / apps / KMPlayer / exit.xml. the format must be a supported XML file.</seg>
<seg id="1718">The animation during start does not need to be short, it is automatically terminated by opening another source. however, this would be annoying in the end animation, so the user can finish the application a second time.</seg>
<seg id="1719">A simple example of a start animation may be the display of a favorite picture: & lt; & lt; bodywork; & lt; img dur = "intec" src = "file: / / / home / Koos / mum.gif" fit = "meet" / lt; & lt; / smilgt; & lt; / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / etc.</seg>
<seg id="1720">There is a tab for configuring MPlayer in the configuration dialog of & KMPlayer; here you can set the path from the MPlayer and the cache size of the data stream from the network and other things.</seg>
<seg id="1721">Another tool for troubleshooting is the 'Console' button in the toolbar of KMPlayer. here the output of mplayer can be seen.</seg>
<seg id="1722">There is no tab for this playback device in the configuration dialog of & KMPlayer; everything must be configured by manual editing of file ~ / .kde / share / config / kmplayerc, such as setting the backend by mimetype. here is an example like a 'flash' played with the swfdec-mozilla module:</seg>
<seg id="1723">'flash' can be played within & KMPlayer; it can even insert the special embed to YouTube in the playlist XML.</seg>
<seg id="1724">So that the & KMPlayer; 'flash' can play in HTML pages, the & KMPlayer must be given as service provider for the mime type application / x-shockwave-flash in the setup dialog file assignments of KDE.</seg>
<seg id="1725">The konqueror or & KMPlayer; is used in a console application and to search for error messages regarding the loading of the browser module library. if no errors occur here, the backend output is inside & KMPlayer; (view, console, or console from the context menu to check).</seg>
<seg id="1726">To always use a predefined backend for a specific mime type (of course only if this has been determined), this must be done by manually changing the file ~ / .kde / share / config / kmplayerc. for example, phonon should play all ogg files:</seg>
<seg id="1727">& KMPlayer; can play from TV cards, either using MPlayer or XVideo (this requires kxvplayer). before watching TV, you need to configure the device to be used and the TV channels. to do this, the scanner can be used from the configuration dialog or the configuration file can be edited manually.</seg>
<seg id="1728">For configuring the VDR (Video Data Recorder) settings in the KMPlayer, the dialog in the Settings under - &gt; Quelle- &gt; VDR- &gt; XVideo Port should be used. there you should detect ports from which one is selected. the encoding must be found (for example, it is PAL for West Europe), the correct name probably has a dvb contained in it.</seg>
<seg id="1729">Since the VDR support from KMPlayer can only use XVideo, XVideo should also work (probably this type of playing video devices under Linux is the only one that works). for this reason, the videoforlinux extension for the XFree86 server must contain the following in its configuration file (/ etc / X11 / XF86Config):</seg>
<seg id="1730">Internally by KMPlayer, various names are used by KMPlayer. at the time of the creation of this documentation, this dvdnaval, dvdsource, exitsource, introsource, pipesource, tvscanner, TVSource, url source, vcdsource and vdrsource. if enabled, start playing the playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1731">Are there any hints how to make my CDROM drive quieter when I play from it (not from the VCD: / /)?</seg>
<seg id="1732">Yes, the command HDPARM -E 8 / dev / cdrom is to run as root after the device is plugged into. it is essential to make sure that / dev / cdrom drives on the CDROM drive.</seg>
<seg id="1733">Xine only starts up slowly, why every time my CPU has to be checked for its performance?</seg>
<seg id="1734">Note: the answer is overhau. kxineplayer automatically needs the last stored value, only the first time xine will check the CPU.</seg>

<seg id="1763">When creating the own & latex; files may be very helpful as soon as a DVI; file [device independent file (engl. D e V ice I nineFile)] was created, jumps & kile; by a click with the middle mouse button in DVI; viewers to the corresponding line in the & latex; source code.</seg>
<seg id="1764">A DVI; file contains a description of the formatted document and other information such as the font and is next to PDF the original output type of & tex; or & latex; there are many tools for viewing, converting and printing DVI; files for different systems and devices.</seg>
<seg id="1765">When using the code search, the elements of the DVI file are drawn up with the editor and as soon as an element in the DVI; file has been clicked, the corresponding section is jumped in the & latex; the default search is the exact opposite of it. as soon as a section is clicked in the & latex; source text, the corresponding point is jumped in the DVI file.</seg>
<seg id="1766">Master document: this function is used when working with multiple files. with a master document, work is simplified with other .tex files. when using a project, a project-wide master document can be set to project settings.</seg>
<seg id="1767">Quick construction: the & latex; source code is compiled and the result is automatically displayed (if there are no errors in the source code).</seg>
<seg id="1768">File monitoring: in this mode, the DVI; file is based on "" "" "" "external" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" and no call from & eyepiece; after fast construction. "" "" "" "</seg>
<seg id="1769">When viewing the editing toolbar, the three large selection fields should be noticed. the selection fields have been developed for quick integration of common elements into the document. the first drop-down box is for quick integration of the document into sections, chapters, sections,... The available & latex; commands for subdivision are:</seg>
<seg id="1770">The selection box For further information is available for items such as keywords, notes or references. the possibilities available are:</seg>
<seg id="1771">Name: with this command, a name for a section, a picture or other element is created.</seg>
<seg id="1772">Cover: used for reference to a specified term (selection above a selection box possible).</seg>
<seg id="1773">When using quote, a selection list with literary entries is displayed. for & bibtex; this only works if the file is connected to a project. the author has good experiences with & kbibtex; and & kb;. the & bibtex; files can also be written in & kile; by hand.</seg>
<seg id="1774">The last drop-down box with the name GrÃ Â¶ Ã Â¼ e is used for defining the font items. it is possible to define the font items for the main text, the joints nodes, etc. there are the following types of fonts available:</seg>
<seg id="1775">When calling & kile; two choices are available: 1. the wizard for creating a new document by selecting document type and setting the settings. 2. the document can be written from scratch by hand.</seg>
<seg id="1776">The parentheses after the command\\ Documentclass contain the settings for the command. the setting [12pt] specifies the font. if the font is not specified at the beginning, this can also be done in the text.</seg>
<seg id="1777">Once the above source code example has been entered, the & latex; source code must be compiled. the easiest way to do this is to use the menu building or button quick construction.</seg>
<seg id="1778">The source code must be stored before compiling.</seg>
<seg id="1779">If the compilation of the document fails, the error should be searched for errors. if this is not the case, the logging should be started automatically. if this is not the case, logging should also be considered.</seg>
<seg id="1780">An environment (English environment) is a text that is treated differently from the rest of the document. for example, a report with the font file 12 is created, and only a few columns should have a different font. the command\\ begin {environment},\\ Huge and\\ end {environment} will then allow for the alteration of the written documents in the environment.</seg>
<seg id="1781">The changes are only checked within the environment (from\\ begin {environment} to\\ end {environment}). there is no limit (number) for the changes within an environment.</seg>
<seg id="1782">There are many possibilities to increase the readability and usability of the document. for example, certain fonts, bold printing, offensive pressure, submissions, etc. can be added. these commands end either with the command\\ end or automatically at the end of the environment.</seg>
<seg id="1783">\\ begin {emph}: this command is for the offensive pressure and is valid until it is closed with\\ end {emph} or any other environment. a single word in a set can be displayed italic with\\ emph {word}.</seg>
<seg id="1784">\\ quote: creates a quote in the document. the quote begins with\\ begin {ratio} and ends with\\ end {ratio}.</seg>
<seg id="1785">After the background for writing the source text with the & latex; drawing language has been presented, now follows a step-by-step guide for creating a document in & kile;.</seg>
<seg id="1786">As soon as a bit of text was entered in the wizard, a few adjustments should be made for the better readability of the document. this should include a quotation, a few passages in bold and cursive print and a poem to be used to see the differences of these commands.</seg>
<seg id="1787">Once the document has been viewed, the editor view or Ctrl E can be returned to the editor (in the internal viewer).</seg>
<seg id="1788">Once the DVI; file was created, the document can be printed out or converted into a & PostScript; / PDF file. simply try and have fun.</seg>
<seg id="1789">DVI; is an independent file format (English D e V ice I nativ). these files are created by & tex; or & latex; for the readability of some drivers of the computer. there are many different types of .dvi output such as printers, & PostScript; / PDF Converter or computer screens.</seg>
<seg id="1790">For printing a & DVI file, the same steps as required for the creation of the document (see). at the 7th step - after clicking on DVI, the document can then be printed by file printing (in the viewer) (if the printer is set correctly).</seg>
<seg id="1791">The toolbar allows the conversion of the DVI file into other formats. as soon as the DVI; file from the & latex; source text was created, the conversion can begin in different formats by means of the buttons in the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="1792">The preview search allows the direct jump from the editor to the associated position within the DVI; file.</seg>
<seg id="1793">& kile; provides a corresponding setting for all and latex; -binaries. to do this, simply setup Modern under Settings box... tools Building will be selected.</seg>
<seg id="1794">To select the preview search, the mouse pointer must be positioned in a row of the source text and then clicked on the preview search. the jump to the corresponding point in DVI; the viewer takes place then.</seg>
<seg id="1795">With this function in & eyepiece; with a click of the middle mouse button in DVI; -document the corresponding & latex; -document of & kile; opened and jumped to the corresponding line. to do so, & kile; in & eyepiece; in & eyepiece (Settings eyepiece... Editor)</seg>
<seg id="1796">If there is no error when using quick construction of the & DVI file, there may be an error. if an error is present, it will be displayed in the logging file or in the message window.</seg>
<seg id="1797">The logging file contains the source code error source. in the editor, the bugs predictive LaTeX errors and nests LaTeX errors can be used for jumps between the errors. in order to view the correct line, the error must be clicked in the logging and & kile; jumps to the wrong line.</seg>
<seg id="1798">Once you click on the corresponding button in the toolbar, a window will appear to select the template you want to use. the default options are:</seg>
<seg id="1799">When selecting an empty document, a document can either be rewritten from scratch or the wizard can be used for the quick creation of a new document. for more information, see the section.</seg>
<seg id="1800">Hands-on users of & latex; usually use the same introduction for almost all documents. templates can be created in & kile; created, stored and loaded to facilitate the creation of a new document.</seg>
<seg id="1801">To create a new template, either an existing & tex; - / latex; file must be opened or created a new file. & kile; can create a new template by opening an existing document and selecting File Template from document...</seg>
<seg id="1802">When creating a new document from a template using File New, some strings are replaced by other data (e.g. name or character encoding). these variables can be set in Settings box... Settings.</seg>
<seg id="1803">When creating your own template it is necessary to know which strings are replaced by which variables:</seg>
<seg id="1804">$$DOCUMENTCLASSOPTIONS $$: this string is replaced by typing in document class. typically, it is used as follows:\\ Documentclass [$$DOCUMENTCLASSOPTIONS $$] {items}.</seg>
<seg id="1805">The easiest way to create a template is to use the wizard and the associated entry of the commands in the editor. once the document has been created in this way, the following steps must be taken:</seg>
<seg id="1806">When creating a new document, your own template can then be selected instead of the standard items.</seg>
<seg id="1807">A template can be created from any & latex; a simple way to create a template needs to be searched for one on the Internet and the steps described below are searched.</seg>
<seg id="1808">& kile; used & kate; as an internal editor. & kate; is a text editor for programmers with the possibility of reading and highlight from many different types of text files (including & latex; and & bibtex;).</seg>
<seg id="1809">To learn more about it; and to know its possibilities, the manual on Kate should be consulted. users of & kile; can begin there directly with reading the chapter works with the editor of & kate; start.</seg>
<seg id="1810">& kile; provides a very practical & latex; command reference which can be called via the LaTeX reference menu. it contains a detailed description of almost all commands that can be found in & latex; use their syntax.</seg>
<seg id="1811">Double-click with pressed Ctrl key to select the & tex; word. that means that in this way, when you click on\\ par\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\.</seg>
<seg id="1812">When dragging the text with a left mouse button, the selected text is automatically copied to the clipboard.</seg>
<seg id="1813">When using the arrow keys with pressed Shift key, parts of the source code can be selected in the Editor window.</seg>
<seg id="1814">& kile; has the possibility to search for various types of source code and emphasize it. for example, the & latex distinguishes itself; -commands from normal text and also the mathematical formulas are highlighted by a different color.</seg>
<seg id="1815">Many assistants can perform additional jump marks. this is an own type of bookmark within the text. the menu entries do the jump to the next or last jump mark. this will also highlight the jump mark, so that it will automatically be deleted during the first input of a character.</seg>
<seg id="1816">Editing is probably one of the main aspects when using a program such as & kile; although & kate; already excellent opportunities offered, have been added in & kile; important functions for writing a & latex; source code added & kile; special commands for their selection.</seg>
<seg id="1817">Select a complete heel (group of lines containing an empty line on both sides). with a paragraph it is not meant a text with continuous lines (like in other text editors). this extended meaning includes tables, & latex; commands and all other lines of the source code.</seg>
<seg id="1818">Select the word under the current cursor position. this selection also has an extended meaning since this command also contains & latex; -commands with a backup line (\\) and an additional star (*) at the end.</seg>
<seg id="1819">To delete a part of the document, of course, it can be selected first and removed by pressing the Delete key. & kate; provides the key Ctrl; K with which the entire line is removed. & kile; provides with own commands here for a faster possibility. under Editing Remove the following commands are included to delete the text:</seg>
<seg id="1820">Remove a complete heel. the definition for a paragraph in & box; is included in the description to edit select paragraph.</seg>
<seg id="1821">It has already been clarified that environments play a central role in & latex; therefore, & kile; for further commands under Edit surroundings for one possible simple work with & latex;.</seg>
<seg id="1822">This command jumps to the beginning of the current environment (no matter where the current position is). the cursor is placed directly in front of the command to close the environment.</seg>
<seg id="1823">This command jumps to the end of the current environment (no matter where the current position is). the cursor is placed directly behind the command to close the environment.</seg>
<seg id="1824">If the cursor is located in front of or inside the command\\ begin {surroundings}, the cursor jumps to the end of the environment (or vice versa).</seg>
<seg id="1825">When entering many nested environment commands, the overview can quickly be lost. this command closes the last modified environment so that the nested environment structure is not destroyed.</seg>
<seg id="1826">& kile; provides also special commands for the & latex; groups that are determined by {...}. under Edit TeX group are a few important commands that correspond to those from the Edit environment.</seg>
<seg id="1827">This command jumps to the beginning of the current group (no matter where the current position is). the cursor is placed directly in front of the opening bracket.</seg>
<seg id="1828">This command jumps to the end of the current group (no matter where the current position is). the cursor is placed directly behind the closed clasp.</seg>
<seg id="1829">If the cursor above or behind the braces of an & tex; -group # is located, jumps to the other end of the group (or vice versa).</seg>
<seg id="1830">When entering many nested grouped parentheses, the overview can quickly be lost. this command includes the last opened group, so that the nested structure of the & tex; groups will not be destroyed.</seg>
<seg id="1831">In & latex; two simple application characters are used as bed liners. for the appropriate implementation is used in & kile; the sign "for two simple touch characters." also for the end of the application the sign "is used. & kile; knows this case and holds two connecting signs for latex; one.</seg>
<seg id="1832">This automatic entry of the double conversion marks can be set up under Settings box... LaTeX can be switched on and off.</seg>
<seg id="1833">It can also be used for ad specific settings (e.g. nolor French) and thus German or French application notes. there are also many other languages available.</seg>
<seg id="1834">When pressing Shift; Enter key & box; an intelligent line break. if the current position is located within a list environment (e.g. enumerate or itemize), & kile; not just a line break but at the same time the command\\ item.</seg>
<seg id="1835">Within a table environment, & kile; the current line with\\\\ with an end-of-the-line termination.</seg>
<seg id="1836">Even better - & kile; is intelligent enough to support preset & latex; - or user-defined environments. these can be tilted under Settings... LaTeX can be added.</seg>
<seg id="1837">Some users want to arrange columns in tables environments and all Et characters (amp;) among each other. & kile; tries to invent this. although this tab is not the added one, & kile; add some space for the columns position of the current tabulator.</seg>
<seg id="1838">Although & kate; already provides a good source code completion, it has been extended in & kile; in order to build special commands (mostly for latex;) there are five different modes. three of them work as needed and the other two are for automatic completion. all these modes can be set for different modes of work under Settings box... Can be adjusted.</seg>
<seg id="1839">At the beginning a new environment is added using the command\\ begin {environment} & kile; automatically add the command\\ end {surroundings} after an empty line (for the text).</seg>
<seg id="1840">When pressing the back button the last letter of the input is removed and possibly the completion list is removed. on the other hand, the list can also be reduced by entering another letter.</seg>
<seg id="1841">All commands are written with a short description of their parameters. the descriptions are obviously removed when selecting a command. alternatively, hock marks may be inserted, so that a simple jump to these positions is possible by editing the jump mark NÃ Â¤chute jump mark and the desired parameters can then be inserted.</seg>
<seg id="1842">Settings kile; set up... kile; complete settings can be made to these lists. there can be several lists of lists for & tex; - and & latex; commands as well as callers of the general language used.</seg>
<seg id="1843">Command mode is not useful for completing environments. there are always a few letters to be entered with\\ begin and the call for complete control mode will result in a large list of surrounding commands. on the other hand, the environments are so often used that & kile; a special mode for completing the environments.</seg>
<seg id="1844">When calling the complete control mode, the menu item Alt + Shift key space bar is automatically filled with the command to open the environment and it appears\\ begin. afterwards, the ambient completion can be continued in the simplest way and can be stopped by pressing the input button.</seg>
<seg id="1845">Once this is done, the environment is automatically closed again. once & kile; realize that it is a list environment, even a first\\ item command is added.</seg>
<seg id="1846">Settings kile; set up... kile; default settings can be made to these lists. this mode uses the list of executing mode for & tex; - and & latex; -commands.</seg>
<seg id="1847">& kile; support custom lists of abbreviations, which are immediately replaced by default strings. the lists can be set up under Settings box... Kile Vercorrupt can be set up. as an example of a drop-down list, the file example.cwl, in which the entry L =\\ LaTeX is included.</seg>
<seg id="1848">For example, if the letter L is entered and the word initiates the word processing mode about the menu, the character L is replaced by the\\ LaTeX string.</seg>
<seg id="1849">Large-scale wipers are not helpful for automatic completion. however, it has been found that many rters are written more than once in a document. this provides & kile; the completion for all already written orders.</seg>
<seg id="1850">This mode can be set up in the Settings box... Kile Versions will be decrypted. here, the threshold value for the display of the completion can also be specified.</seg>
<seg id="1851">The complete files can be installed in the subfolder ~ / .kde / share / apps / kile / complete / mode / of the personal home folder. mode stands for abbreviation (abbreviation), dictionary (WÃ Â¶ rterbuch) or tex.</seg>
<seg id="1852">The dialog Prints incorporate the introduction of graphics as simple as possible. to view the basics of the graphics formats, the sections should be considered.</seg>
<seg id="1853">PS files are not as well known as PDF files but provide an excellent basis for changes and reorders from pages. if the PDF output is required, the pages can be rearranged with a few & PostScript; tools and then converted to a PDF file with ps2pdf.</seg>
<seg id="1854">In order to be able to examine the results of the work, the source code must be compiled. all construction tools are grouped together in the menu Creating compiling, converting and creating view.</seg>
<seg id="1855">For compiling the source code for viewers like & Okeyepiece; or the further conversion can be used by the key single Alt; 2. afterwards, the DVI; file can be viewed as a standard viewer by means of Alt; 3, by means of old; 4 the DVI; file converted into a PS file and viewed using Alt; 5 the PS file.</seg>
<seg id="1856">When using the Quick Start command, a viewer is usually called after compiling. if no embedded viewer is used, a new window will each be opened each time.</seg>
<seg id="1857">A new project is about the MenÃ Â¼ project New Project.... This is where the following information is consulted for the project:</seg>

<seg id="1916">The version 3.2 by & quantaplus; contains many new & XML; tools and functions. these tools are unique in their integration in & quantaplus; all these tools use commanders as surface and libxml2 and libxslt. the combination results in fast, efficient, complete and productive tools.</seg>
<seg id="1917">Anyone who has worked with the & kde; documentation knows me and how outstanding it is. if we still take it a piece, we give it a graphical interface! no longer rely on a terminal; simply click the icon for the XML processor and finished!</seg>
<seg id="1918">This application expects a index.docbook in the folder. if index.docbook is located in a gewy working folder, then let the current working folder be checked. if not, then remove the selection of current working folders and enter the desired folder in the field of other folders.</seg>
<seg id="1919">Output files are stored in the same folder as the source files. all previous & HTML; files are deleted every time my Outlook is started.</seg>
<seg id="1920">As already said, anyone who has worked on the & kde; documentation already knows how helpful this application is. and with & quantaplus; there is now a great graphical interface for that.</seg>
<seg id="1921">If the currently opened file is index.docbook, simply select the current working folder. if not, then select the current working folder and enter the folder where index.docbook is to be found.</seg>
<seg id="1922">If it comes to an output on the screen, its file is faulty. please check the reported errors and try again.</seg>
<seg id="1923">If the file to be checked is already marked in & quantaplus, then you can simply edit the current file. if not, you delete the file in the current file and select the file to be checked by another file - File selection.</seg>
<seg id="1924">If you just want to know if the well-formed file is, click the well-formed check option.</seg>
<seg id="1925">To use a & DTD; which is specified in the & XML; file, choose & DTD; (Internal), otherwise & DTD; (External) and specify the location of the & DTD; file selection. both for the & W3C; & XML; schema and for the RelaxNG inspection is the definition of the definition URI; in the file selection necessary.</seg>
<seg id="1926">Yes, & quantaplus; has also a & XSL; processing tool! this uses the xsltproc tool from the libxml2 library.</seg>
<seg id="1927">If the file to be processed in & quantaplus is already selected, then you can simply select current file. if not, remove the current file and select the file to be processed using the other file chooser.</seg>
<seg id="1928">Enter the name of the file as the result should have named, and the file will normally be stored in your home folder.</seg>
<seg id="1929">The plug-ins, the & quantaplus; load, have with & quantaplus; even possibly little to do. this makes the plug-in system very powerful. you can benefit from the additional functionality immediately and do not wait until somebody builds the fake in & quantaplus; the plug-ins can be used in a large number of & GUI; more about it further down.</seg>
<seg id="1930">To install a plugin or a part, we start with the Edit menu. this opens the following dialog:</seg>
<seg id="1931">This dialog allows to manage all contained plug-ins and add new ones. we describe each & GUI; element in it:</seg>
<seg id="1932">Here you can enter the search path. when adding plugins without a location use & quantaplus; this path to search the plug-in.</seg>
<seg id="1933">Many people often work on a project in a sort of hierarchical relationship to each other. & quantaplus; supports the specification of team members and they can be configured with Shift; F7 Project Properties dialog.</seg>
<seg id="1934">The name and email entries are self-explanatory. Nickname is the nickname of the user and is used for unique identification.</seg>
<seg id="1935">One member can have several roles in the project, such as team leaders and sub-project leaders.</seg>
<seg id="1936">The user can choose from the list of team members who he is. this happens by selecting the team member from the list and pressing the Setze + button. the currently selected member (their identity) appears fat after you are: text.</seg>
<seg id="1937">Nicknames and the setting of your own identity are important in terms of news and comments. see for more information on annotations.</seg>
<seg id="1938">Apart from an overview of their team, there is another advantage by recording the members of the team: it can be an event for information to be created for information to the team leaders when something is happening.</seg>
<seg id="1939">Event actions are actions that are executed when something happens in the project. an example would be recording the opening and closing of the project, so that later it can be seen how much someone worked on it, or sending a message when a file is backed up, or a script that plays a file into CVS once it is added to the project & etc;</seg>
<seg id="1940">On the page event configuration of the Shift + F7 Project Properties dialog, events can be created, edited and deleted.</seg>
<seg id="1941">An email is sent to the addressees selected in the recipient list. the addressee can be a team or sub-project leader.</seg>
<seg id="1942">Notes are special comments in the documents. they differ from normal comments by the following:</seg>
<seg id="1943">Input Notes is simple. you can either select the note entry from the Editor context menu or enter the @ annotation keyword in a comment section followed by annotation text.</seg>
<seg id="1944">In this case, the syntax @ annotation (nickname) or @ annotation (role), with the nickname of the nickname of the team member, is part of the project: team Manager Area Manager Subproject leaders should be given the corresponding area or sub-project names, as shown in the following examples below.</seg>
<seg id="1945">Nicknames and roles names are case-sensitive, but spaces around the brackets and the name are invalid.</seg>
<seg id="1946">& quantaplus; is a development environment for scripting and formatting languages, which is DTD-agnostic and supports web-based formatting and scripting languages.</seg>
<seg id="1947">The settings can be reached via the Settings menu. here, only about & quantaplus; -specific settings are treated, a short description for the others can be found in.</seg>
<seg id="1948">The settings can be set up using the Quanta settings... to be called. this dialog extends over a few pages that are treated one after the other.</seg>
<seg id="1949">The behaviour of & quantaplus; regarding tags, including car completion, can be changed. entries are:</seg>
<seg id="1950">Large / lower case tags: large / lower case of tags inserted automatically. normal size / lowercase means the tags will be inserted as described in the tags XML files.</seg>
<seg id="1951">Large / lower case of attributes: large / lower case of automatically inserted attributes. normal size / lowercase meaning the attributes are inserted as described in the tagXML files.</seg>
<seg id="1952">Optional tags lock automatically: if checked, for tags, for which the closing tag is optional, this immediately after & gt; inserted.</seg>
<seg id="1953">Do not include optional tags: as above for all other tags except simple tags.</seg>
<seg id="1954">Automatically update start and end tag: if enabled, the corresponding tag will be changed and vice versa.</seg>
<seg id="1955">Automatic replacement of accent characters: controls the automatic conversion of accented characters into the corresponding coding during typing.</seg>
<seg id="1956">MIME types: mimetypes for detecting various types of files. using the Standard button, the defaults can be restored.</seg>
<seg id="1957">Standard character encoding: the encoding of newly created or otherwise opened files (where the encoding of the file can be passed). however, this setting here will be stocked by the same in the project properties if a project is loaded.</seg>
<seg id="1958">Standard DTD: the selected DTD is used for newly created files, or for files whose DTD has not been identified. however, this setting here will be stocked by the same in the project properties if a project is loaded.</seg>
<seg id="1959">Creating a backup copy: & quantaplus; creates regular backup copies so that in case of a power failure or crash during the next start of the program, the document can be recovered from this backup. this is not the same as saving the file.</seg>
<seg id="1960">The preview and documentation can be displayed either in the editor pane or in your own view (or the documentation in a folder), which makes it possible to view the documentation, preview and source text at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="1961">Reset the window settings to the default back at the next start is useful when the user interface is confused by changing the MDI modes and andocks / abutting of views. it corresponds to the --resetlayout command line parameters.</seg>
<seg id="1962">The warning field is used to control the display of warnings through the check of no more questions.</seg>
<seg id="1963">The place to change behavior of & VPL; to change the display of symbols instead of scripts as well as synchronization behavior of VPL and source text view in shared mode. see the different modes see.</seg>
<seg id="1964">Here the parser and the structure tree, representing the illustration of parser nodes in the document, can be set into details.</seg>
<seg id="1965">In the mouse click on the structure tree, the following action is possible to change the action triggered by clicking on the structure tree with the mouse buttons.</seg>
<seg id="1966">In the Structural Tree Settings, the visibility of nodes in the tree, the refresh frequency of the tree when editing and how deep when changing the structure tree can be opened automatically. empty nodes are empty areas in the text, while empty groups are those in which no element has been found in the current document.</seg>
<seg id="1967">The shortcuts are grouped in groups, each can be valid for multiple & DTEP; s. this means there can be a valid group for PHP in which the ifclause shortcut means something else than in a group valid for Javascript.</seg>
<seg id="1968">Here the plug-ins can be managed. plug-ins are part-applications of third party, which can be re-used by any node-capable application, at the best known & konqueror; when inserting a plug-in, the following must be specified:</seg>
<seg id="1969">Address: the path to the plugin if it is not in a standard such as $KDEDIR / lib.</seg>
<seg id="1970">Input: this information is passed to the plugin during startup, so it can open the current file, the corresponding folder (path of the current file) or the project folder.</seg>
<seg id="1971">Load component in "read-only" mode: verify that the plugin refuses to load. only-read KParts usually deny loading if this option is not selected.</seg>
<seg id="1972">Check the plugin: if this is enabled, test & quantaplus; if the information entered is correct, then saving the application will enable you to save the entry when the plugin is not available at the moment, but it should be installed later.</seg>
<seg id="1973">For & quantaplus; starting with version 3.3, troubleshooting has been completely redeveloped. support for the no longer necessary built-in & PHP; (3) Debugger has been set, as well as support for DBG debugger. instead, a debugger plug-in concept has been implemented which enables different implementations via plugins.</seg>
<seg id="1974">Currently only one plugin is available, the support for the use of & gubed; inquantaplus; included.</seg>
<seg id="1975">The use of the Debugger for a project starts with the selection of a suitable debugger plug-in in the project settings. using the Options button next to the Debugger Plugin selection field, the specific settings can be changed.</seg>
<seg id="1976">If a debugger is enabled for a project, some additional elements appear in the & quantaplus; interface:</seg>
<seg id="1977">A view in which the content of monitored variables is displayed. usually appears in the left dock.</seg>
<seg id="1978">A view where all stops are listed with line numbers and conditions. usually appears in the lower dock.</seg>
<seg id="1979">A view in which the output (as shown in HTML) of the debugger is shown. usually appears in the bottom dock.</seg>
<seg id="1980">Depending on the supported functions of the debugger, everything or part of the following functionality is available.</seg>
<seg id="1981">With this action, the connection to the debugger, if necessary, is made, or it tells the plugin to listen to Debugantry requests. this action is triggered by default when a project is opened that uses a debugger, so that normally it does not have to be considered.</seg>
<seg id="1982">The counterpart to Debuggen session starts the session. closes the connection to the debugger or closes the sound according to requirements.</seg>
<seg id="1983">Sends an HTTP request to the server to initiate a debug request. this is equivalent to using a browser to view the current document. the output of this request is displayed in the Debugger output view.</seg>
<seg id="1984">Instructs the Debugger to start executing the script and continuously send information about the monitored variables as well as the currently executed line. if this happens while the script is stopped, execution will continue. if it is started before a debug request is started, the script will start with the request.</seg>
<seg id="1985">Instructs the Debugger to start executing the script without having to send information to the variables and the current line number. if this happens, while a script is stopped, execution continues.</seg>
<seg id="1986">The debugger performs the next instruction in the script without going into the functions or include.</seg>
<seg id="1987">The debugger will execute the next instruction in the script, where possible in functions and include, if possible.</seg>
<seg id="1988">Instructs the Debugger to pass the instruction and go to the next one as if there is no current one.</seg>
<seg id="1989">Opens a dialog where a variable or an expression can be entered which should be monitored. the monitored value appears in the variable view.</seg>
<seg id="1990">With this dialog, a variable can be entered or a new value of a variable can be set.</seg>
<seg id="1991">& kxsl; is a work by Keith Isdale as well as this part of the documentation. & kxsl; is a & kde; front end and a part of xsldbg which they can find on http: / / xsldbg.sf.net with many other works of Keith.</seg>
<seg id="1992">This chapter describes how to customize & quantaplus; to suit your needs and how to help & quantaplus; help to become better.</seg>
<seg id="1993">Document type editing packages (DTEP; s) are used in & quantaplus; to provide support for markup and scripting languages as well as & CSS; their simplicity and flexibility makes aus & quantaplus; a fast, user-friendly & IDE; for web developers, easy to use and productive.</seg>
<seg id="1994">& DTEP; s exist in two types, family 1, the Markup languages and family 2, the script languages or & CSS; s & DTEP; s consist of two file types, file & descriptionrc; and TagXML files with suffix .tag.Toolbars are handy, symbolic pastes of image buttons (above the editing window), which insert text and instructions more quickly into a document than a user ever could.</seg>
<seg id="1995">& DTEP; s can be created manually (see below), downloaded or automatically created from an existing DTD. see for details about the conversion.</seg>
<seg id="1996">This document describes how to create TagXML files, then the descriptionrc; and also toolbars. in short, a & DTEP;.</seg>
<seg id="1997">TagXML files (.tag) define both the specific attributes for tags as well as the layout and contents of the properties dialog, the & quantaplus; file contains the rules and information of the & DTEP; even. tool bars allow quick inserting of tags in a document without danger of a writer.</seg>
<seg id="1998">Tag folders are nothing but folders. they contain only the descriptionrc; and the TagXML files. tag folders bear the name of the description language and version, so present. (for example, html-4.01-strict)</seg>
<seg id="1999">The table below lists the elements of the tag XML and declares whether they are necessary, or not. although not all are necessary, it is advisable to use as many as possible so that other users have a better insight and more information about working with them.</seg>
<seg id="2000">The following chapter describes each element in detail. everything about the possibilities and limits is explained in a simple way.</seg>
<seg id="2001">This is the root element of a tag XML document. it can only occur once in a document. it can contain the definition of many tags, but it contains nothing else than just element type.</seg>
<seg id="2002">The type of the tag is a script function. when using, & lt; attr &gt; is an argument of the function. (only Family 2)</seg>
<seg id="2003">Only valid for tag type class. the name of the base class for this class. (only family 2)</seg>
<seg id="2004">Only valid for the type method. specifies the name of the class where this method belongs. (only family 2)</seg>
<seg id="2005">If yes, the tag has a common attribute and attributes within this tag can be added to any other tag. (only family 1)</seg>
<seg id="2006">Sets a text in the dialog. this text is determined by the & lt; text &gt; tag. this is a only element type element.</seg>
<seg id="2007">Describes an attribute of a tag. this element can only occur once for each attribute. it specifies the name and type of the attribute. additionally, there are other tags describing how this attribute is to be displayed & etc; This is a only element type element.</seg>
<seg id="2008">Returns the source code used for filling in the tag editor dialog and in the attribute tree</seg>
<seg id="2009">Requires source = dcop. the dcop interface within & quantaplus; will be used to achieve source data.</seg>
<seg id="2010">Requires source = dcop and the name of an interface. the dcop method name within & quantaplus; is used to achieve the data source.</seg>
<seg id="2011">Requires source = dcop, a interface and a method name. the arguments passed to the method can be empty or% tagname%, which means the name of the current tag.</seg>
<seg id="2012">A container tag that groups the elements of a list. it can occur only once for an attribute description. it is an element type element.</seg>
<seg id="2013">Specifies the position of the attribute text of a tag within a dialog. this tag can only occur once for each attribute in a dialog (e.g. once for each & lt; attr &gt; tag). the element is empty.</seg>
<seg id="2014">Specifies the position and size of a field in the dialog. this tag should be present for each field in the dialog once (e.g. one for each & lt; attr &gt; and & lt; label &gt; Tag). this element is empty.</seg>
<seg id="2015">Specifies a list of elements that may occur within the tags to be defined. this element is a only element type.</seg>
<seg id="2016">Specifies a list of elements that end a day. this element is an only element type.</seg>
<seg id="2017">All tag XML files must start with an & XML; declaration: & lt;? XML version = 1.0 encoding = UTF-8? &gt; and must be properly chained and closed.</seg>
<seg id="2018">Spaces influence nothing, but be careful & lt; characters. these should be replaced by & lt; tooltip &gt;, & lt; know; whatsthis &gt;, and & lt; text &gt; will be replaced.</seg>
<seg id="2019">To check the TagXML files, the Tools dialog is dialog at the top of the & quantaplus; -Window to start and check TagXML. another dialog will appear whose simple instructions are to follow.</seg>
<seg id="2020">This function is currently not available yet. currently, the verification only takes place when loading the TagXML files in & quantaplus.</seg>
<seg id="2021">In the following an example of a family 1 tag XML file. this file describes the & lt; schema &gt; element from the & W3C; & XML; schema. the filename for this TagXML file should be schema.tag.</seg>
<seg id="2022">The following is an example of a working family of 2 TagXML file. in this file, a & PHP file is described; the filename of this TagXML file is to be overload.tag.</seg>
<seg id="2023">& lt;? XML version = "1.0" encoding = "UTF-8"? &gt; & lt; tag name = "function" returnkey = "function" returnkey = "optional" / &gt; & lt; / tag &gt; & lt; / tags &gt;</seg>
<seg id="2024">The descriptionrc; file is just as simple and there is an editor to be accessible via DTD editing DTD settings. this allows diedescriptionrc; for a file descriptionrc; for a newly created & DTEP; should be created a simple & descriptionrc; with the following entries:</seg>
<seg id="2025">[general] Version = 3.1.2 and 2 for each higher version. name = DTD statement. (- / / W3C; / / DTD HTML 4.01 Transitional / / EN) Nickname = The simplified name of the DTD. (HTML 4.01 Transitional). if not specified, the name is used as nickname.</seg>
<seg id="2026">An action can be set with settings actions... created. clicking New Action leads to the same dialog:</seg>
<seg id="2027">The shortcut assigned to this action. by clicking the Custom Button you can assign a shortcut; with K1 the current shortcut table can be removed.</seg>
<seg id="2028">The simplest actions. a text can be entered in the defined settings and in the execution of the action, this text is inserted in the document at the current cursor position. see the example below.</seg>
<seg id="2029">This is the most powerful type of action. with the help of this action, external applications (usually scripts, but it is not limited) that change the document or use it as input (or parts of the document).</seg>
<seg id="2030">First, the name of the script and the interpreter must be specified. example: SH / home / myHome / myScript.sh.</seg>
<seg id="2031">Although qualified paths are allowed, it is recommended to use the% scriptdir variable in command line like sh% scriptdir / myScript.sh. This way, & quantaplus tries to find the script in the following places: $KDEDIR / share / apps / quanta / scripts in their path: $PATH There are other special variable that can be used in the command line:</seg>
<seg id="2032">% f: we are replacing the URL of the current document. in case of a local document file: / from the document name will be removed.</seg>
<seg id="2033">% pid: is replaced with the PID of the running & quantaplus; only an instance is running, the text unique is attached to the PID number. this is useful when DCOP is used to control & quantaplus; from the external script.</seg>
<seg id="2034">The parameters for this event, usually the file name of the current document or the path to the project file.</seg>
<seg id="2035">In addition to the methods listed above, a script can be input from & quantaplus to the default input. input can be specified in the input field, which is to be sent to the default input. possibilities are:</seg>
<seg id="2036">Selected text: the selected range of the document is sent to the script. the% input variable is normally only useful with this setting.</seg>
<seg id="2037">According to the input, the output of the executed application can also be redirected. there are two types of output: standard output, run to standard error output. it can be specified, what should be done with the text written to the standard output by setting the value to the output selector output:</seg>
<seg id="2038">If there are many tags in the markup language, it is recommended to divide the tags in logical groups. it is necessary to create an own toolbar for each group. in a given case, it is not too many, so you can create a toolbar with the name of the markup.</seg>
<seg id="2039">Once a toolbar has been added, you need to add and configure actions. select Settings.</seg>
<seg id="2040">The parts of this window are pretty self-explanatory. press the New Action button at the bottom of the window to start editing mode.</seg>
<seg id="2041">Complete all necessary fields and add the tag to the right tool bar.</seg>
<seg id="2042">Complete everything and, if the tag has attributes and you are planning to use them, enable dialogue "Edit" when available to enable an input when using the action.</seg>
<seg id="2043">Igitt! is that a ugly symbol. who should remember the action in connection with this symbol? let us replace it before we have difficulties.</seg>
<seg id="2044">To create a symbol, that the action represents better, we will use & kiconedit; select from the & KMenu;, Graphic Show other programs (or where else it is located in your distribution).</seg>
<seg id="2045">& kiconedit; used by default 32x32 pixels, but we need 22x22. to change this, select Edit size.</seg>
<seg id="2046">Please note that the created symbol not only helps you to remember what the action does, but also to all other users of the & DTEP.</seg>
<seg id="2047">In view of the day start, I decided to create a start button as a symbol. by using green (green is usually called off, fixed, further interpreted), or should at least, a message to the user will be signaled that clicking this symbol is a & lt; startd; tag will be inserted in the current document.</seg>
<seg id="2048">After creating the symbol it has to be connected with the action. this is done via the menu with Settings... (in & quantaplus;) and selecting the desired action. next to the text box is a button, press it.</seg>
<seg id="2049">Select the folder where the stored icon is located, select it and confirm with OK.</seg>
<seg id="2050">Press the Apply button and continue with other tags, so there are still some, or confirm with OK to complete.</seg>
<seg id="2051">Suppose you want to add some common & quantaplus; functions to the toolbar, or it should be shared to several groups for a better overview. open the tool bar to set up dialog via Settings Toolbar. make sure that the desired toolbar is selected.</seg>
<seg id="2052">After selecting the element to be added to the toolbar, press the arrow key to the right. this adds the element to the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2053">For example, I want a quick way to access the Konqueror preview. I will select it and add to the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2054">Please note how the separators support grouping. someone who doesn't know my toolbar might believe that the & konqueror; button is the opposite of the start button.</seg>
<seg id="2055">The new toolbar must be tested by using all symbols to make sure everything works.</seg>
<seg id="2056">After New XML does not exist, it will be created in the root folder, but your toolbar (s) should be stored in the right folder. please adjust its descriptionrc so that your toolbar will be loaded (s) when a file is opened from the appropriate folder.</seg>
<seg id="2057">Perhaps the most notable extension of & quantaplus; for the normal user is the possibility to add documentation for the scripting language or the formatting language you like most. therefore, this chapter describes how I create a & PHP; documentation tree for my personal use.</seg>
<seg id="2058">Before you start your own documentation, you could check in & quantaplus; - Repository whether someone has done this for you.</seg>
<seg id="2059">There are two parts in this process. first you need to look for an existing documentation for the formatting / script / etc; language. then you need to create the docrc file.</seg>
<seg id="2060"># KDE Configuration file [Tree] Doc dir = path, relative to this file, for example php42 / # elements in the main index top element = your description for these documents e.g. & PHP; 4.2 Documents Section 1 = Section1.html Sec2.1 = Sec2.1.html tag 1 = functions1 = func.html tag1 = day 1.html tag2 = tag2html tag3 = day 3.html</seg>
<seg id="2061">The tree section defines the visible part of the documentation in the documentation tree. for example, see in the & PHP documentation:</seg>
<seg id="2062"># KDE Config File [Tree] Doc dir = php42 / # top level element element = PHP 4.2 documentation PHP 4.documentation = Table of Contents, # Getting Started, # Language Reference = basic syntax,... Basic syntax = language.basic syntax...</seg>
<seg id="2063">Note the # prior to Getting Started and Language Reference. this indicates that it is a subfolder in the tree with its own content. there is no known limit for the depth of the box (except by reason) mdash; but try it out for yourself.</seg>
<seg id="2064">Note that the table of contents is referenced directly to a file (and consequently at the top of the tree view & mdash; folder is displayed!).</seg>
<seg id="2065">Spaces do not affect, but be careful & lt; characters. these should be replaced by & lt; & lt; in all & XML; -based & quantaplus; resource files will be replaced.</seg>
<seg id="2066">The content section is the area of the docrc file, which serves to create context-sensitive help. by selecting the function name and pressing Ctrl; H for context help, the documentation is displayed directly. there are only two types of entries here: the context list (ContextList) and the file binding lines.</seg>
<seg id="2067">A simple list of context elements that should be available (for & PHP; these are the functions of & PHP;).</seg>
<seg id="2068">Now you can save your file docrc to $HOME / .kde / share / apps / quanta / doc or $KDEDIR / share / apps / quanta / doc for local or global use. then create a folder (as specified in your file docrc) in the same folder as docrc and copy your HTML documentation to it.</seg>
<seg id="2069">If you are sure that these are good and worthy to be shared, send your docrc files with a description of important information, e.g. which documentation was used to the & quantaplus; community. you will not get rich, but be proud to have worked with the best web development platform.</seg>
<seg id="2070">With & quantaplus; you are not alone. it is possible to share the waste resources (DTEP packages, tool lists with actions, scripts, templates) with others. there are two ways to do this:</seg>
<seg id="2071">The resources can be sent by e-mail to friends, partners or anyone else. at different places there is an Email menu entry like DTD DTD package (DTEP) with email, send tool lists toolbar with email, in the context menu of files and folders in templates and in the scripts tree.</seg>
<seg id="2072">The resources can be uploaded to our main archive, from where all the others & quantaplus; users can download them. to make a valid contribution we recommend to sign the resources for which it needs a GPG / PGP key. thus, the origin of the resources is ensured, both for our team and for the later users.</seg>
<seg id="2073">When uploading, you are asked for their passphrase for their private gpg key (the passphrase is not saved), or in the event that you have multiple keys you can choose one. in the New resource dialog, the input fields must be filled out (URL preview can remain empty) and start uploading by clicking OK.</seg>
<seg id="2074">Uploading can be uploaded from the DTD DTD package (DTEP) menu, Uploading Toolbar Toolbar, and started in the context menu of files and folders in the templates and scripts tree.</seg>
<seg id="2075">After downloading a resource, before installation, examine & quantaplus; the integrity of the resource by checking integrity and signing. in case of problems it is warning and it can then be cancelled. please note the warning messages carefully. if the integrity is given and the resource is signed correctly, a message appears with the indication of the source of the resource.</seg>
<seg id="2076">It is possible to work in XML languages, which are currently not yet supported by & quantaplus; however, creation can be time-consuming because hundreds of tag files could be necessary in tagXML format. there is the easiest way to automatically convert a DTD into a DTEP package.</seg>
<seg id="2077">The conversion can be started from the DTD Menu and Convert a DTD. select the .dtd file with the DTD description to be used. after that the following dialog appears:</seg>
<seg id="2078">Target directory name: the newly created & DTEP; is written with this name in the $KDEHOME / share / apps / Quanta / dtep folder.</seg>
<seg id="2079">! Doctype Definitions line: the string that will appear in! doctype Tag, such as HTML PUBLIC - / / W3C / / DTD HTML 4.01 Transitional / / EN http: / / www.w3.org / TR / HTML4 / loose.dtd</seg>
<seg id="2080">Fine adjustment of the DTEP after conversion: when enabled, & quantaplus; after conversion the descriptionrc; editor, with the details of the newly created & DTEP; it is recommended to use this option.</seg>
<seg id="2081">In & quantaplus; there are some key concepts. to understand them and to get full benefit from & quantaplus, you must first familiarise yourself with these fundamental concepts.</seg>
<seg id="2082">In & quantaplus; the working area is divided into three areas: global, locally and project-related. this distinction concerns a number of components in & quantaplus;.</seg>
<seg id="2083">Global elements are available for everyone, the & quantaplus; all that is considered global is stored in the common folder structure of & quantaplus. this allows the group of administrators to secure different toolbar, actions and patterns in the global tree, which are then available to everyone in a multi-user environment on the system.</seg>
<seg id="2084">Local elements represent a personal collection of web development tools for a single user. these are user-specific patterns and toolbars. local elements are stored in the user directory so that they can only use this user personally.</seg>
<seg id="2085">Project-related elements are available only within a specific project. this can be anything from & CSS; patterns to toolbars with special actions especially for the files of a particular project. simply put, this is the most limited size. all elements are stored in the folder tree of the project, which emoglows the common use of special tools and samples from all employees within the project.</seg>
<seg id="2086">The & quantaplus; -MDI; consists of some main areas: the editor window, the building manners, the index tabs with information and tool bars. please suggest in, and for further information on these areas.</seg>
<seg id="2087">You can click the tab with the right mouse button to get a context menu with the current document matching entries, such as closing the current, other or all the tabs, reload, delete or upload the document, jump to a bookmark or execution of CVS commands to the current document.</seg>
<seg id="2088">Right clicking in the editor pane will lead to a further context menu with regard to the edited document content, such as basic editing steps (cut / copy / paste), edit the tags under the mouse cursor, or open the file, if the string is called a file under the mouse cursor.</seg>
<seg id="2089">At the top of the editor window are the toolbars of the editor. currently, & quantaplus; & HTML; 4.01 Transitional as standard for which a set of tool bars is shown. in the course of further expansion of & quantaplus, the tool bars are adapted to the new functions and related user requirements.</seg>
<seg id="2090">The use of tool bars is really easy. if you want to insert a single day, e.g. & lt; insert into your document, then click the icon representing the tag. now you can insert the data for this just inserted day. if you want to insert a tag that has multiple attributes (such as anchor), you can fill in a dialog box.</seg>
<seg id="2091">The Baumanners (QIT;) allow for information on & quantaplus; to navigate, to open and roam. in the presentation with index guides are available for files, project, sample templates, document structure, scripts, attributes and documentation.</seg>
<seg id="2092">Project Management is a powerful tool that provides & quantaplus; this view shows all files in the project and allows managing the files in the project by right-clicking. actions such as addition, removal, uploading or deletion of the files from the storage media can be done using the context menu displayed.</seg>
<seg id="2093">Another possibility of & quantaplus; is the use of templates. almost everything can be a template: pictures, program parts, a whole website, etc; there are all options open to you.</seg>
<seg id="2094">Templates can be divided into three categories depending on the context they are used. global templates are always available, local templates are always available, local templates only for the respective user and templates in projects can only be used in the project.</seg>
<seg id="2095">Here you can find information about the available scripting languages. the concept of structure in Global, Local and Project works here too. by clicking with the left mouse button you can access the available information to a script. by clicking with the left mouse button you can access the available information to a script.</seg>
<seg id="2096">With this view, the internal structure of the active document is displayed. by clicking an element, the cursor is placed in the document on the position of the element. by right-clicking an element, a list of commands opens in relation to navigation and refresh of the tree.</seg>
<seg id="2097">This tree appears among the other tree views. with it, you can quickly change attributes and namespaces. the application system aligned to the content allows you to change all available attributes with just a few mouse clicks.</seg>
<seg id="2098">Here is the complete documentation on web technology for your development. you can download pre-packed documentation for & quantaplus; from the quantaplus; 'documentation site, you can create your own documentation, and by adding a folder doc to a project can add, edit and view project-specific documentation.</seg>
<seg id="2099">By default, & quantaplus; two tabs at the bottom of the window that can be accessed via the beneficial information: the message window and the problem window.</seg>
<seg id="2100">This tab shows information about each script running in Quanta. for example, the currently used DTD of the current document and all changes to DTD are displayed.</seg>
<seg id="2101">This tab shows all errors in the current document's markup. & quantaplus; -scripts that are executed give all error messages (so there are) in this window.</seg>
<seg id="2102">The & quantaplus; tool bars are extensively expanded and easy to understand. show them on a symbol and they get the corresponding command. the chocolate page of the toolbar is the option to define your own commands as symbols in & quantaplus.</seg>
<seg id="2103">Another function of & quantaplus; is the ability to send a tool bar by e-mail. & quantaplus; sends the toolbar as compressed tar archive via & kmail; if you receive a tool bar in an email, you can backup and load it in & quantaplus; like any other file!</seg>
<seg id="2104">It is reasonable if you want to customize the location of the & quantaplus; for this autoconf has a number of options that can be passed to the configure script. to get a complete list of all options, type. / configure --help. the options are simple to understand and not executed here.</seg>
<seg id="2105">If you have trouble starting & quantaplus, you should check if your path contains the & kde; 3 bin folder. also, you should make sure that is not an older version of & kde; 3 in the PATH before its bin folder. the same applies to & Qt;.</seg>
<seg id="2106">& quantaplus; is a web development tool for the KDE desktop. & quantaplus; has been optimized for rapid web development and combines a mature development environment with a variety of powerful features.</seg>
<seg id="2107">While trying to create the best & HTML; editor, the developers of & quantaplus began to deal with an obvious idea: what would be if & quantaplus; a standalone, extensible markup language editor? well, this would make it the absolutely great web development tool for & kde; so it was done.</seg>
<seg id="2108">No longer restricted to pure & HTML; limited, & quantaplus; now far on the way to a general and comprehensive web development tool. summarized: if you can define it in & XML; then should & quantaplus; for that the appropriate & IDE; be.</seg>
<seg id="2109">Well, to the aforementioned claim must be held that & quantaplus; as a product based on the outstanding efforts of the entire & kde; developer community based. & quantaplus; follows, in good application of free software, the idea of Why Developing what someone else has developed?</seg>
<seg id="2110">& quantaplus; allows web developers to use an intuitive and powerful multi-document interface (MDI;). this can dramatically increase productivity. by means of self-knitted actions, scripts and toolbars, automation is possible almost every task.</seg>
<seg id="2111">& Quanta; Plus; is a web development environment for HTML and related languages. it was designed for fast web development and quickly became a mature editor with many powerful functions.</seg>
<seg id="2112">& Quanta; Plus is in no way associated with commercial versions of & Quanta; the original developers left the GPL licensed version and produced a commercial program.</seg>
<seg id="2113">More details in the details are with help: / Quanta (either enter this URL in & konqueror; or execute helpcenter help: / Quanta).</seg>
<seg id="2114">& Quanta; is currently being developed and supervised by Eric Laffai Sequitur @ kde.org and Andras Mantia amantia @ kde.org.</seg>
<seg id="2115">A quick access list of files that you have opened. this list changes every time you open a file that is not on it, with the oldest entry removed.</seg>
<seg id="2116">This allows you to save code parts and whole files as templates for later use. if you are trying to save the selected file / text outside the local / project template folder, only one error is reported.</seg>
<seg id="2117">Converts special characters to & HTML while inserting from the clipboard there, so that they are displayed correctly and not misunderstood by the browser as formatting instructions.</seg>
<seg id="2118">Converts text from clipboard in & URL; depreciation, which is the correct way to insert specific characters and spaces in & URL; s. primarily used for inserting & URL; s into the anchor tag.</seg>
<seg id="2119">Switches the block selection to / off. this allows you to select text blocks using the & Shift key.</seg>
<seg id="2120">Go directly to a line number. this is very helpful if your & PHP; script gives error messages!</seg>
<seg id="2121">Searches a string or regular expression in the selected directory. a kind of grep or sed with GUI and predefined expressions to help you.</seg>
<seg id="2122">Displays the message window or not. this is the window in which you can see the display of scriptions and debugger.</seg>
<seg id="2123">Initial and switching on the problem reporter at the bottom of the & quantaplus; main window. the problem reporter is activated once you switch to the structure tree.</seg>
<seg id="2124">Displays the toolbar icons to the left of the main window. this column allows you to set bookmarks with a click of the mouse.</seg>
<seg id="2125">If there are bookmarks in the current file, they will appear in the menu along with the entries Previous or Next, depending on the cursor position in the document.</seg>
<seg id="2126">Bookmarks from other opened documents appear in the menu grouped according to the filename of the other documents.</seg>
<seg id="2127">Opens an existing project from the hard drive. & quantaplus; projects are saved with the extension .webprj.</seg>
<seg id="2128">Presents a dialog for inserting files into the current project. the selected files will then be copied to the project directory.</seg>
<seg id="2129">Searches the project directory for new files that could be there. that allows, for example, to copy graphic files to your project folder or subfolder and then add them to the project.</seg>
<seg id="2130">Loads the files in your project on the server. the list of available transport methods depends on your version of & kde; from and if you have downloaded more input / output modules (KIO slaves).</seg>
<seg id="2131">Settings like & quantaplus; the project manages. in chapter & quantaplus; -Projects you will find details.</seg>
<seg id="2132">Loads a project tool bar. these are stored in project dir / toolbars and are only available in this menu if you have assigned them to this project.</seg>
<seg id="2133">A dialog to save your toolbar. allows you to select the type of toolbar: locally or project.</seg>
<seg id="2134">Open a dialog to add a new toolbar. actions must be created by setting up actions... added. tool boxes will be saved through toolbar buttons, or you will be asked when you exit if you want to save the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2135">If you haven't saved the toolbar, you'll be asked if you want to do that.</seg>
<seg id="2136">This allows you to send your own toolbar to someone (perhaps to the & quantaplus; team so that the toolbar is in the next release). the menu item opens a new email message with the toolbar as appendix.</seg>
<seg id="2137">Enables uploading of tool slides to the main server, where everyone else can access it.</seg>
<seg id="2138">Load a & DTD; which you or anyone else has made and convert to the & quantaplus; own description format.</seg>
<seg id="2139">Load / refresh the entities from the & DTD; it makes sense if the entities from the & DTEP are to be freshened without the entire & DTEP; if this is global and a write permission in the global KDE folder is not present, the load fails.</seg>
<seg id="2140">This menu contains a list of tags that are present in the currently loaded toolbars. if the default (HTML;) tool bar is loaded, there is a submenu standard in the Tags menu which contains the list of tags / actions on this toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2141">Allows access to the current day settings dialog when there is one. this entry is always present in the Tags menu, followed by & DTD; -specific submenus.</seg>
<seg id="2142">Activated or deactivates the intelligent inserting of tags. currently, this only works with (X) HTML DTDs. intelligent inserting means that & quantaplus; the insertion by means of tool bar is denied when this day contradicts the rules in this place.</seg>
<seg id="2143">In the Plugins menu, the available plugins are listed under the above menu items. click on it. click on an activated plug-in deactivates it.</seg>
<seg id="2144">Selects the syntax highlighting mode for the current file. the list of available highlighting schemes depends on derkate; version.</seg>
<seg id="2145">Very useful when you know people using other OS platforms to develop. choose Unix, Windows / DOS or Macintosh.</seg>
<seg id="2146">Checks the syntax of the current document using the selected & DTD; using the external application tidy.</seg>
<seg id="2147">Immediate switching between the different types of user interface. due to some limitations in the KDE libraries, switching may sometimes need time or create unpleasant graphics. recommended is the card card mode, which is also the default setting, or the subwindow mode, which corresponds to the representation in & quantaplus; 3.2 and earlier.</seg>
<seg id="2148">In addition, this menu contains an entry for each open sub-window. selecting an entry will activate the corresponding subwindow.</seg>
<seg id="2149">Switches the status bar display at the bottom of the & quantaplus; main window.</seg>
<seg id="2150">The changes in this dialog affect any application that uses the KHTML part, including the & konqueror; web browser.</seg>
<seg id="2151">Set up the behavior of the editor window. in the documentation of & kate; you will find details.</seg>
<seg id="2152">A dialog appears where you delete entries from the toolbar, or which you can add and change the sequences.</seg>
<seg id="2153">This should generate a help according to the environment of the mouse pointer, but is not yet implemented.</seg>
<seg id="2154">& quantaplus; is a high quality product that is freely available and freely licensed, but as with any open source project developers can always use help. if they want to support the & quantaplus; development in financial form, they find the way here.</seg>
<seg id="2155">The fields are self-explanatory and should preferably be completed from top to bottom, since the entire directory structure is automatically completed for the rest of the project, e.g. after completing the project name. all of these paths and author information fields can later be adjusted with Shift + F7 Project Properties.</seg>
<seg id="2156">Here is the name for the project, for example foo. when entering the name, file is filled in automatically.</seg>
<seg id="2157">This is the name of the & quantaplus; project file. by default, it has the name of the project in lowercase letters and without spaces with extension webprj (e.g. foo.webprj). this file is stored in the project directory.</seg>
<seg id="2158">Here is the server address of the machine you want to access, except you can edit local data. either a name (hostname.exempl.de) or an IP address (127.0.0.1) are possible.</seg>
<seg id="2159">If you leave this field empty, the default settings of the selected protocol will be used. depending on the setting of the remote host, an adjustment might be necessary.</seg>
<seg id="2160">This is the folder where the templates are stored for the project. it is a relative path to the project and by default templates. if a shared collection of files is used for different projects, this folder should be set instead of the standard.</seg>
<seg id="2161">This is the folder where toolbars are stored for the project. it is a relative path to the project and default toolbars. if a shared collection of files is used for different projects, this folder should be set instead of the standard.</seg>
<seg id="2162">This allows to insert files from the local file system into the project. multiple files or entire folders can be selected.</seg>
<seg id="2163">This setting is great if you have static web content you want to download and change. for server-side scripts (e.g. & PHP;, Python, & etc;) you have to proceed differently.</seg>
<seg id="2164">Checked if files that are located somewhere in the main folder of the project should be included. if a project is started from scratch, don't hook up.</seg>
<seg id="2165">With this option, all files and folders will be displayed inside the main folder and you can select a precise selection according to good manure.</seg>
<seg id="2166">This shows a list of files in the root folder. you can select the desired files by hook or, by removing the checkbox, clips out of the project.</seg>
<seg id="2167">The last screen of the new project wizard contains three settings that simplify your work. these settings can be uploaded to the Project Properties menu in the File Tree window or Shift + F7.</seg>
<seg id="2168">Some settings correspond to those in the project wizard and are described in. the additional entries are explained below.</seg>
<seg id="2169">A list of filenames (wildcard possible), which are ignored for project-related operations such as project folders.</seg>
<seg id="2170">Additional options to above, including files listed in .cvsignore, are excluded from the project.</seg>
<seg id="2171">The project view, which is loaded when the project is opened, can be read more about project views.</seg>
<seg id="2172">This way the desired debugger can be selected. currently only Gubed is supported. more information about Gubed can be found in. the Debugger plugin can be set using the Options button.</seg>
<seg id="2173">In the profiles of the profiles, high loading profiles (see in) can be set, as well as the display of a tree view for the content of the server for each profile, by showing an individual view of each profile.</seg>
<seg id="2174">In the team configuration subwindow, project members can be added, edited or deleted as well as a mailing list. see details.</seg>
<seg id="2175">In the event configuration subwindow, you can switch event actions and add, modify or delete these actions. event actions are executed when a pre-defined event occurs, such as the backing of a file. see the details.</seg>
<seg id="2176">By default, & quantaplus; the last project that was opened. you can't influence this behavior at the moment.</seg>
<seg id="2177">To open a different project, select project... from the menu project or the icon project open from the toolbar. the dialog project will be displayed and allows the selection of a project. projects have .webprj as extension.</seg>
<seg id="2178">If & quantaplus; closed, the project file will be saved automatically. you'll be asked if you want to save changes before leaving, if & quantaplus; changed files. the same happens when you load a new project.</seg>
<seg id="2179">Project supervision gives free access to the files in the project. there, the files can be managed in the current project.</seg>
<seg id="2180">The folder behaves as well, but the entries are missing opening and opening with... in the context menu available with the right mouse button:</seg>
<seg id="2181">Various profiles can be selected here. the profile contains information about the location of the uploaded files. see.</seg>
<seg id="2182">Allows removal of the current profile. if only one profile exists, the button will be blinded to prevent the removal.</seg>
<seg id="2183">The password is kept in the core memory and forgotten by the programmer. this option is useful when frequent uploading of files is necessary and the rather unsafe password saved on the disk -option does not come into question.</seg>
<seg id="2184">This will stop the transfer or simply leave the dialog when you change your mind before uploading.</seg>
<seg id="2185">In & quantaplus; many high loading profiles can be created, so that the project (or parts of the project) can be uploaded to different servers. when editing or creating a profile, this dialog is displayed:</seg>
<seg id="2186">This is the name of the server on which the files should be copied. either a fully qualified domain name or an IP address will work.</seg>
<seg id="2187">The Transfer Protocol for uploading. the list depends on the version of & kde; and the installed kio slaves. at least you should choose from & FTP;, file (local) and nfs.</seg>
<seg id="2188">The port for the transfer. normally, this does not need to be changed, except the network administrator does not operate a service at the usual port.</seg>
<seg id="2189">Depending on your fear threshold, this is either a time-saving function or a danger. use it at your discretion. the password is stored on the disk, so it cannot be read easily, but everyone with programming knowledge can easily see it in plain text.</seg>
<seg id="2190">A project view is only a set of files and tool slides. there can be many views in a project, i.e. by simply changing the view various files and toolbars can be loaded and replace the currently opened files and toolbars.</seg>
<seg id="2191">Views can be stored, opened or deleted in the project or project toolbar, accessible via Settings Toolbar project toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2192">This chapter describes the parts of & quantaplus; with which one has the most to do. this not only helps to increase productivity but also allows the adjustment of & quantaplus; to the own working method.</seg>
<seg id="2193">As mentioned above, tool bars in & quantaplus are best designed using the tool toolbar. use and addition differ. adding tool bars is treated at the bottom of the section Add toolbars.</seg>
<seg id="2194">The toolbar and the symbols on it can be set either using the context menu (right-click on the toolbar), other actions such as toolbars can be removed, toolbar buttons or toolbars can be executed, which can be specified in the dialog, where the actions on this or other toolbar can be visible.</seg>
<seg id="2195">By calling the context menu to an action (symbol) on a toolbar, the entries will be removed and action processed, which are self-explanatory.</seg>
<seg id="2196">The toolbar and actions on them can be set up in the Settings menu... and set Settings...</seg>
<seg id="2197">Templates are basically document skeletons, code snippets and files to link. & quantaplus; use templates basically like a common file system with advanced organization and interfaces. you can copy, move or link any existing directory into the template tree. templates have in & quantaplus; in about the restrictions you present for the file system.</seg>
<seg id="2198">Some with & quantaplus; provided templates have conditions for their use. please read the conditions specified at the beginning of each template before use.</seg>
<seg id="2199">Binary templates are usually inserted in documents using links (e.g. images with img src = / src / url). some examples can be found in the template tree under global templates.</seg>
<seg id="2200">Documents can be from any text document type. based on these templates, new documents can be created. normally, more specific documents can be created in appropriate subfolders. some examples can be found in the template tree under global templates. see for more information on the template tree.</seg>
<seg id="2201">This type of template is useful if not a new document based on a template but the same text area should be included in the document again and again. you can find everything from a comment on a final note up to a complete menu system on Javascript or Perl.</seg>
<seg id="2202">As the name says, these templates serve entire websites as templates. they are a collection of various documents that can be organized in a folder structure, summarized in a compressed tar archive. currently there are no examples in & quantaplus;.</seg>
<seg id="2203">Design a document structure at will (XML;, & HTML;, DocBook & etc;) and select File As a template, save as a local template....</seg>
<seg id="2204">Once this has happened, notice that (even if it was saved as a project template), the template is not visible in the project tree.</seg>
<seg id="2205">Select text in your document and click File As a template, save as a local / project template. alternatively, you can simply drag and drop them to the tree view template.</seg>
<seg id="2206">The creation of binary templates is simple: the file can only be copied to a template folder. it allows all file management functions to be used, such as pulling and dropping or pasting over the conqueror file tree.</seg>
<seg id="2207">In the file tree or in the project files you can click on a folder to the right and create a site template, enter a name for the template and secure it. by default, it is saved in the project folder, but of course it can be stored as a local or global template.</seg>
<seg id="2208">Project templates allow a very target-oriented approach. you can present headlines and footers, or dynamic with & PHP; design, paste or link with them. in addition, you can keep an eye on some things when using templates in projects.</seg>
<seg id="2209">The template structure in the subwindow templates is based on the files laid in $KDEDIR / share / apps / quanta / .kde / share / apps / quanta / templates. each of these folders corresponds to one of four types of containers as explained above.</seg>
<seg id="2210">To specify the behavior of a folder, right click the folder and select Properties in the context menu. the following dialog appears:</seg>
<seg id="2211">A selection box with the three previously described types; files, text or templates. this selection is blinded as soon as elterial attributes are advertised.</seg>
<seg id="2212">This is enabled by default and fits all except the master folders in the template list. if a root folder would be configured in such a way, it would deactivate the templates in this path, unless they are explicitly enabled. if nothing appears, you will probably find yourself in a root folder.</seg>
<seg id="2213">Allows leading or later text templates for templates in this folder. this might be general headers or footers for all templates for a particular project and allows to copy content templates to a folder with special headers / footers a whole presentation already with the appropriate headers / footers.</seg>
<seg id="2214">In addition, the context menu (pointing, right mouse button) has a complete command collection for adding folders or copying and pasting templates from one place to another.</seg>
<seg id="2215">& quantaplus; provides two modes: VPL; -Editor and VPL; & source text editor that can be reached via the View menu. the first mode replaces the source text editor by the VPL; Editor and the second divides the editor window into two parts: the source text editor and the VPL; editor.</seg>
<seg id="2216">The VPL; Editor works as follows: it loads a document like a normal & HTML; - or & XHTML; page and a cursor appears. then you can edit and turn back to source code editor where the changes made in the VPL; Editor in the source code are visible.</seg>
<seg id="2217">When working with the VPL; Editor on a document that contains & PHP; it is not possible to edit it directly with the VPL; -Source. it is not possible to edit it directly using the VPL; to edit it, the source text editor is still necessary. there are no plans to change this behavior.</seg>
<seg id="2218">The second mode works just like the first one, except that at the same time the changes are both in the source text editor and in the VPL; editor is running synchronously. with pressing F9 this mode is activated, this mode is active, the key press releases the active cursor from one window to another, while maintaining the position in the document.</seg>
<seg id="2219">The synchronization distance between the VPL; Editor and the source code editor is adjustable via Settings Quanta. after choosing VPL, you can choose between synchronization after one click or automatically. in principle, the time span can be set automatically.</seg>
<seg id="2220">Suppose you want to change the title of the website, so the editing of invisible tags is possible when working with the VPL; Editor. the document properties dialog is also called when a new document is created using the VPL; this serves to reduce the manual coding. this allows you to change the following:</seg>
<seg id="2221">Meta tags allow storing information about the document itself, e.g. keywords for Internet search engines. meta elements can be added or removed by pressing the two buttons below. a click into the list allows the change of contents, e.g. keywords on the column name and keyword 2 on the content column.</seg>
<seg id="2222">CSS rules are the new way to design the pages in your browser. you can add or delete CSS rules with the buttons below the list. a change over the list is possible just as with the Meta elements. editing CSS rules is currently not supported.</seg>

<seg id="2281">There are many graphical tools to compare. so why & kdiff3;? let me briefly explain why I wrote.</seg>
<seg id="2282">The merge was very complicated because one of the contributors made many changes and at the same time corrected the indentation at many places. another programmer had changed a lot of text in the same file. the result was numerous conflicts when merging.</seg>
<seg id="2283">The program I used showed me only the changed lines, but I could not see what exactly changed within these lines. and there was no reference to the places where perhaps only the indentation had changed. the merging of these changes was a small nightmare.</seg>
<seg id="2284">That was the beginning. the first version of & kdiff3; could display differences within one line and changes to white characters. later, lots of other useful functions were added.</seg>
<seg id="2285">For example, if you want to compare text quickly, simply copy it to the clipboard and insert it in one of the comparison boxes.</seg>
<seg id="2286">A function that made a lot of work was the comparing and merging of folders. this function converted & kdiff3; almost into a full-fledged file browser.</seg>
<seg id="2287">Also 3-way merging is fully supported. this is useful when two people work independently of one piece of code and make changes. the original file (the base) helps to resolve conflicts and simultaneously displays the expected result. in this editor you can even edit the result directly. in this editor you can even edit the result directly. the screenshot shows three source files when merging:</seg>
<seg id="2288">& kdiff3; also helps you to compare and merge entire folders. this screenshot shows & kdiff3; when assembling:</seg>
<seg id="2289">& kdiff3; shows the exact differences and is based on the possibilities of today's color monitors. if you frequently need to check codes, you will like this function.</seg>
<seg id="2290">Differences in white characters and tabs are displayed visible. if rows only differ in a certain number of white characters, you can see it at a glance at the summary in the column at the left. (no more trouble if someone changes the indentation.)</seg>
<seg id="2291">If a file is the same and the other differs in one line, then the color indicates which file is different. red color means that both are different.</seg>
<seg id="2292">If all files have the same name, but in different folders, you can make the typing work easier by writing only the filename of the first file. example:</seg>
<seg id="2293">Kdiff3 Folder 2 Folder 2 Folder 2 Folder 2 Folder 2 Folder 2 Folder 2 Folder 2 Folder 2 Folder 2 Folder 2 Folder 2 Folder 2 Folder 3 Folder 3 -o target folders</seg>
<seg id="2294">Opening dialog allows manual typing of file names, selecting a file browser (file...) or selecting an last opened file from the drop-down list. the opening dialog will notice your selection and display it again next time. you do not have to specify a third file; if you leave the entry for C, the analysis of the differences will be done with two files.</seg>
<seg id="2295">Through the button Folder... you can also select a folder. if you select a folder, the same or merging folders will be initiated. however, if a file is selected for A, for B and C, then use a folder, then use & kdiff3; the filename from A in the two other folders.</seg>
<seg id="2296">If merging is enabled, the input field is active and can be edited. however, it is not strictly necessary to specify an output file immediately. you can also do this step later when saving.</seg>
<seg id="2297">The setup button opens a dialog with Settings. here you can set options before you start the merge / merge.</seg>
<seg id="2298">Sometimes you don't want to compare a whole file, but only parts of a text. & kdiff3; allows you to drag text parts from the clipboard into the active comparison window. the comparison starts then immediately. in the Open Dialogue, you do not have to select any files, you can simply close the dialog with the Cancel button.</seg>
<seg id="2299">You can also use drag and drop: simply drag a file from a file manager or selected text from an editor and let it fall over a comparison window.</seg>
<seg id="2300">What is the idea behind it? sometimes a file contains several similar functions. if you want to find out how similar these functions are, it would be a relatively big effort. you should first create two corresponding files, load them in & kdiff3 and then compare them. now you can simply copy, insert and then compare the relevant sections.</seg>
<seg id="2301">Note: currently you can do nothing from & kdiff3; pull out. only dropping text into a comparison window is supported.</seg>
<seg id="2302">Warning: some editors interpret the dragging and dropping text into another program as cut and paste (instead of copying and pasting). in such a case, your original data could be lost.</seg>
<seg id="2303">The info line of the source pane contains the characters A, B or C, the filename and the line number of the first visible line in the window. (note that window C is optional.) Any information line has a different color. (if the path to a file is too long, leave the mouse to rest for a while above the line. then a small auxiliary window will display the full name.)</seg>
<seg id="2304">The three source windows are assigned the letters A, B and C. a has the color blue, B the color green and C is magenta. (these preferences can be changed via the Settings menu.)</seg>
<seg id="2305">When comparing both files, the default color is red. (color for conflicts in the settings). the color scheme is particularly useful when comparing three files. that's good to see in the next section (merge).</seg>
<seg id="2306">If differences are found, the column displays the corresponding color. if differences in white characters are not so important, it is useful to see only the relevant changes. (in C / C + +, for example, white characters are only relevant in strings and comments, for the preprocessor and in few, rare cases.)</seg>
<seg id="2307">The vertical line separating the summary column from the text is interrupted at the points where the source file has no lines. if the line break is enabled, the line is dotted with dotted lines.</seg>
<seg id="2308">The result window (among the comparison windows) also has an info line with the wording output:, the filename and [Change] if you edited the result. usually it contains text by automatic merging, but often it also contains conflicts.</seg>
<seg id="2309">!!! until all conflicts are resolved, saving is deactivated!!! (use the buttons Springe to find the next resolved / unresolved conflict to find the remaining conflicts.)</seg>
<seg id="2310">If only two comparison windows are used, each difference is at the same time a conflict that must be solved manually.</seg>
<seg id="2311">By clicking with the left mouse button in the drawing column in one of the window the group belonging to the group will be marked in all windows and the first line of the group will be displayed. (this will also cause a jump in the position in the windows where the beginning of the group would otherwise not be visible.) This group will be highlighted with the color background color for current area and each on the left appears a black bar.</seg>
<seg id="2312">Sometimes there is no more line left in the group by automatic merging or manual editing; this is only a placeholder in the case that you change your mind and maybe select another source again. this text does not appear in the final stored file, nor in a marker that you may copy and paste somewhere else.</seg>
<seg id="2313">The text & lt; merge conflict; however, appears in the clipboard when you copy such text from the result window. be careful with this function.</seg>
<seg id="2314">Note: if the options are ignored when selecting the sources, ignoring ignores C / C + + comments, changes in figures or comments are also treated as white characters.</seg>
<seg id="2315">Navigate mainly with the scroll bars and the mouse, but you can also use the keyboard. if you click in one of the windows, you can use the arrow keys left, right, high, down, side on, side, end, end, Ctrl-start and Ctrl-End, Siw as you can also be used by other programs.</seg>
<seg id="2316">In the display window, you can also use the other buttons to edit. with the insertion button you can switch between insert and overwrite mode. (preset is insert mode.)</seg>
<seg id="2317">One click with the left mouse button in one of the summaries synchronizes the view of all windows to the beginning of each group (as explained in the Conmerging and the editable output window).</seg>
<seg id="2318">The toolbar contains seven buttons for navigation with which you can jump to the current / first / last difference, to the next / previous conflict (Ctrl-Image Upward / Ctrl-Image Abroad) or to the next / previous unresolved conflict.</seg>
<seg id="2319">To copy the mark to the clipboard, you need to copy the Copy button (Ctrl-C or Ctrl-Insert). if this is enabled, whatever you select will be automatically copied to the clipboard and eliminating manual copying. however, be careful with this option, because you could accidentally overwrite the clipboard contents.</seg>
<seg id="2320">Line ends are stored according to the underlying operating system. Unix flavors use a line feed character\, and Win32-based systems use auto-return + line feed\\ r\. Kdiff3 does not retain the line end of the source files, so you should not use & kdiff3; also not using binaries.</seg>
<seg id="2321">The options and the list of recently used files will be saved automatically at the end of the operation and restored at the next start. (menu Settings - &gt; KDiff3 Set...)</seg>
<seg id="2322">(on some systems, the dialog also provides fonts with variable width to choose from, but you should not use them.)</seg>
<seg id="2323">If you activate this option, differences will be displayed in italics. if the selected font does not support this display, nothing happens.</seg>
<seg id="2324">On systems with only 16 or 256 colors, some colors could not be available in their pure form, but would be rendered as astert. on these systems, the Preferences Button will automatically create an unjust color.</seg>
<seg id="2325">If this option is enabled, the corresponding number of spaces will be inserted when pressing the tab key. otherwise, a tab character will be inserted.</seg>
<seg id="2326">If you press input or return, the return of the previous line will automatically be used for the next line.</seg>
<seg id="2327">When this option is checked, each selection is automatically copied to the clipboard. the manual copy to the clipboard is omitted then.</seg>
<seg id="2328">You can select which line end type you prefer to save. the default value is the commonly used selection on the operating system used.</seg>
<seg id="2329">The second step compares each line. the second step compares each line. in this step white characters are not ignored. even when merging white characters, white characters are not ignored.</seg>
<seg id="2330">Some editors (on some systems) store a carriage return character\\ r 'and a line feed'\ 'at the end of one line, others only save a line feed'\ '. usually, the auto-return marks may look identical, although they are different.</seg>
<seg id="2331">In default, this option is deactivated. in the first part of the analysis figures and associated characters ('0' - '9', '.', '-') are ignored.</seg>
<seg id="2332">In default, this option is disabled. changes in comments are treated like changes in white characters.</seg>
<seg id="2333">The option is enabled by default. it is effective for complicated and large files, but slowly with very large files.</seg>
<seg id="2334">In automatic mode, this setting determines how long the result of the selection is displayed before the next unresolved conflict continues.</seg>
<seg id="2335">Automatically triggers all conflicts in white characters by using the selected file as source. (default is manual selection.) This is useful if white characters are less important in many files. if you only need this from time to time, use the Select A / B / C functions for all unresolved white conflicts from the merge menu.</seg>
<seg id="2336">These options are discussed in the chapter on the scanning of folders and executing a merge. look for details under documentation on the directory comparison and merge operation.</seg>
<seg id="2337">If a file is stored and an older version already exists, then the original version will be appended to the suffix .orig. if already such a backup file exists with the suffix .orig, it will be deleted without further backup.</seg>
<seg id="2338">Adjust the language of the interface. changing this option does not apply to the currently running program. you need & kdiff3; quit and restart, so that the change becomes active. (this option is in the KDE version of & kdiff3; not available because the language is set global over the control center.)</seg>
<seg id="2339">The following encoding settings can be set separately for each entry. if enabled, the upper setting will be used for all entries.</seg>
<seg id="2340">In the selection fields for encoding, a brief notice appears, which is the local encoding. (this cannot be changed here and has a purely informal character for you.)</seg>
<seg id="2341">Adjust the file encoding for source files. this influences how special characters are treated and interpreted. since encoding is individually configurable for each file, even files with different coding can be compared and merged.</seg>
<seg id="2342">If you have edited a file, you can specify which coding to be used to save.</seg>
<seg id="2343">If you define pre-processing commands, they might not work with your codec. (for example, your files may be 16-bit Unicode, but the pre-processing command can only deal with 8-bit ASCII.) With this option you can specify the encoding of the output of pre-processing commands.</seg>
<seg id="2344">Turn off this to suppress highlighting changes in white characters in text or review columns. (note: this also applies to changes in numbers or comments if the options ignore numbers or ignore ignore C / C + + comments.)</seg>
<seg id="2345">This selection is only available if you compare three files. in normal mode, all differences are displayed in a color coded overview column. but sometimes you may only see the differences between two of three files.</seg>
<seg id="2346">Sometimes you would like to use the available space on the screen rather for long lines. just open the less important windows. (this option is in the window menu.)</seg>
<seg id="2347">Classifies the comparison boxes next to each other or over each other. this can also be useful for displaying long lines. (this option is in the window menu.)</seg>
<seg id="2348">Sometimes you view the differences and then decide unexpectedly to merge the files. a simple click starts the merge and uses the file name of the last source file as default name for the output file. (if this function is used to restart the merge, then the name of the last file will be retained.)</seg>
<seg id="2349">When reading a file, it is first passed to this external command. in & kdiff3, then the output of the command is visible, not the file itself. you can write your own pre-processor that corresponds exactly to your requirements.</seg>
<seg id="2350">When reading a file, it is first passed to this external command. if a normal pre-processing command is specified (see above), then the output of the command is the input of this command processing command. you can write your own pre-processor command that corresponds exactly to your needs. each input line must have an associated output line.</seg>
<seg id="2351">The idea behind this is to give the user more flexibility in setting up the diff results. however, an external program is needed, and most users do not want to program it themselves. however, the good news is that in most cases, sed or perl is sufficient.</seg>
<seg id="2352">Use this pre-processing command for line offset to convert the input into capital letters: SED's /\\ (. *\\) /\\ U\\ 1 / 'That. * is a real expression of the text found on each string and in this context refers to the found text in the first log file.</seg>
<seg id="2353">The\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\</seg>
<seg id="2354">While you experiment with sed, you may start to understand it and perhaps you may even like these regular expressions. they are very useful because there are many programs that support very similar things.</seg>
<seg id="2355">Ignoring numbers is actually a built-in function in Kdiff3. but it is good as an example for another pre-processing command for line offset. sed's / [0123456789.-] / / g 'Each signal between' ['and'] 'is a hit, and each hit is replaced by nothing, so quasi cleared.</seg>
<seg id="2356">Sometimes you might want to perform several implementations at once. then you can use the semicolon ';' to separate the compositions from each other. example:</seg>
<seg id="2357">Instead of sed you can use something else such as perl -p -e's / regexp / regexp / replace / SCHALTER 'However, perl needs some details. where sed\\ (and\\), perl needs only (and) without the previous'\\ '. example:</seg>
<seg id="2358">The data after the normal preprocessor will be retained for displaying and merging. further operations will only alter the data that the line balance algorithm will look like.</seg>
<seg id="2359">Note: in rare cases, if you use a normal preprocessor, the line-like preprocessor will see the output of the normal preprocessor as input.</seg>
<seg id="2360">The pre-processor commands are very useful, but as with any function that changes text or hides differences, you may not notice certain differences and in the worst case destroy important data.</seg>
<seg id="2361">Often programmers need to process many files in a folder. for this reason you can compare and merge with & kdiff3; complete folders recursively.</seg>
<seg id="2362">... makes a proposal for each object to merge; you can adjust the proposal before starting,</seg>
<seg id="2363">... can simulate the merge and display the simulated changes without actually performing it,</seg>
<seg id="2364">... performs selected actions either with all (F7 key), or only with the selected objects (F6 key),</seg>
<seg id="2365">This is very similar to comparing and merging single files. you only need to specify folders on the command line or in the dialog file.</seg>
<seg id="2366">When three folders are merged, folder 1 will be used as base. if no destination folder has been specified, & kdiff3; Folder 3 as destination folder.</seg>
<seg id="2367">Note that only the comparison of folders automatically starts, not the merge. to start the merge, you need to select the corresponding menu item or press the F7 key. (see more details.)</seg>
<seg id="2368">While reading the folder, a small message window will inform you about the current progress. if you cancel the scan, only the files that have been compared to that list will be listed.</seg>
<seg id="2369">When scanning the folder is completed, it shows & kdiff3; a list window with the results on the left,...</seg>
<seg id="2370">Each file and folder found during the scan will be displayed here in a tree. you can select an object with a simple mouse click.</seg>
<seg id="2371">The folder structure is usually folded up. you can open a folder by double clicking on the + / - click on the + / - click, or double-click on the object or by double-clicking the arrow keys for left / right.</seg>
<seg id="2372">When you double-click on a file, the file comparison is started and a comparison window appears.</seg>
<seg id="2373">The icon in the Name column reflects the type of file in the first folder (A). these types are possible:</seg>
<seg id="2374">If the file type is different in the other folders then this is visible in the columns A / B / C and in the Details Pane to the selected object. in such a case, the merge action cannot be selected automatically. if the merge operation is started, you will be informed about problems of this type again.</seg>
<seg id="2375">As seen in the picture above, the columns A / B / C use the colors red, green, yellow and black.</seg>
<seg id="2376">With identical entries, however, the color is also identical, even if the age of the entries is different.</seg>
<seg id="2377">Folders are considered to be identical if their entire content is identical. then folders have the same color. at folders, age is irrelevant for its color.</seg>
<seg id="2378">The idea of this color scheme is based on dirtiff. the colors reflect the colors of a leaf, which is only green, then yellow and later when it is old, red becomes.</seg>
<seg id="2379">... A and C are identical, but not B: copying B (or if B does not exist, delete the target if it exists)</seg>
<seg id="2380">... A and B are identical, but not C: copying C (or if C does not exist, delete the target if it exists)</seg>
<seg id="2381">... B and C are identical, but not A: copying A (or if A does not exist, delete the target if it exists)</seg>
<seg id="2382">... A, B and C do not have the same file type (e.g. if A is a folder and B a file): error: conflicting file types. as long as such faulty objects exist, merging cannot be started.</seg>
<seg id="2383">... A and B do not have the same file type (e.g. if A is a folder and B a file): error: conflicting file types. as long as such faulty objects exist, merging cannot be started.</seg>
<seg id="2384">The synchronization mode is active when only two folders and no explicit target folder were specified and if the option synchronize dirs. then select & kdiff3; the necessary action so that afterwards both folders are identical. if for one entry...</seg>
<seg id="2385">... A and B exist, but are not identical: merging and saving the result in both folders. (the user sees only B as visible file name for the output file; copied directly after merging & kdiff3; B by A.)</seg>
<seg id="2386">When two folders are merged and the Option New File instead Select (unsafe) is enabled, then examine & kdiff3; the date of the files and suggests the newer file to copy. if the files are different, but the same date, an error message appears: files are different, but the date is identical.</seg>
<seg id="2387">During merging, a file is processed after the other. you status column shows your position when the merge was successful, and correspondingly other messages when something unexpected happened. if the merge is completed, you should make a final check and see if the status is all right.</seg>
<seg id="2388">When the file comparison method is selected in the setup dialog, Kdiff3 will display more columns. these contain the number of unsolved, soldered, non-white and white conflicts. (the column for resolved conflicts is only displayed when three folders are compared or merged.)</seg>
<seg id="2389">You can either merge the currently selected entry (file or odds), or all entries at once. if you have selected all the assembly actions (also in all subfolders), you can start the merge.</seg>
<seg id="2390">Note: if you have not specified a destination folder, C is used as a destination in the Three-folder merge mode, B is selected as the target and used as a target when synchronizing A and / or B.</seg>
<seg id="2391">If you have selected a destination folder, please check that all entries should be in the target folder, also be displayed in the folder structure. there are some options that might skip certain entries. check these options to avoid unpleasant surprises:</seg>
<seg id="2392">To merge all entries, select directory merge / continue in the directory menu or press F7 (the key shortcut) to merge only the current entry: select Action from the current element or press F6.</seg>
<seg id="2393">If the conflicting file types still exist invalid cladding actions, a message appears that indicates the faulty elements. you can then select a valid action for them.</seg>
<seg id="2394">When you merge all entries, a dialog box appears with the options Implementation, Simulation and Cancel.</seg>
<seg id="2395">Select Simulate if you want to see what would happen without the real changes made. you will then receive a detailed list of all actions.</seg>
<seg id="2396">& kdiff3; then performs certain actions with all entries. if a manual intervention is necessary (merge a single file), then a merge window opens (note the screenshot).</seg>
<seg id="2397">When you are finished with a file, select the directory merge again, or press F7. if you have not yet saved, a corresponding dialog appears. then, & kdiff3 will perform its work with the next entry.</seg>
<seg id="2398">At the end of the list, you will see some error messages that will help you to overcome the cause of the problem. if you continue to merge (F7 key), let & kdiff3; you have the option to select another action for the entry or solve the problem in another way before proceeding with merging.</seg>
<seg id="2399">If some entries were combined individually, you notice & kdiff3; these entries (in the current session) do not merge again. even if the merge has been skipped or not saved, these entries will be considered completed. only if you change the merge action, these entries will be merged again.</seg>
<seg id="2400">The Settings menu of & kdiff3 (Set menu Settings - &gt; Kdiff3...) now has a section called directory merge with these options:</seg>
<seg id="2401">Only files that match the specified pattern are displayed in the ElementTree. multiple patterns can be entered. separate the patterns with a semicolon; valid placeholders: '*' and '?'. (e.g. * .cpp; * .h). the default is *. folders do not have to match this pattern.</seg>
<seg id="2402">Files and folders that match this pattern are not displayed in the element tree. it can be entered more than a pattern, use the semicolon; as separator. valid placeholders: '*' and '?'. default is * .orig; * .o.</seg>
<seg id="2403">Files and folders that match this pattern are not displayed in the element tree. it can be entered more than a pattern, use the semicolon; as separator. valid placeholders: '*' and '?'. default is * .orig; * .o.</seg>
<seg id="2404">Ignored files that would also be ignored by CVS. many autmatically generated files are ignored by CVS. the big advantage is that this can be configured with a .cvsignore file. (see info: / cvs / cvsignore.)</seg>
<seg id="2405">In some file systems, files have a hidden attribute. in other file systems, a leading dot indicates a file as hidden. this option lets you decide whether to view these files in the element tree or not. this option is turned on in default.</seg>
<seg id="2406">Links to files: if the option is turned off, symbolic links are compared. if the option is turned on, the files will be compared to which the links show. this is deactivated by default.</seg>
<seg id="2407">When the option is turned on, the symbolic links will be compared. if the option is turned on, the links will be treated as normal folders and recursively searched. (note that & kdiff3; not checked for possible recursions.</seg>
<seg id="2408">Performs a complete analysis of each file and displays the statistics columns. (the number of soldered, unsolved, non- white and white conflicts.) Full analysis is slower than a simple binary analysis, and much slower when applied to files that contain no text. (enter a corresponding anti-pattern.)</seg>
<seg id="2409">If you compare large folders through a slow network, it may be faster to compare only the change date and file size. however, this speed advantage does not cost you a certain degree of security. please use caution. this option is turned off in default.</seg>
<seg id="2410">Similar to a change date. there is no real comparison. the files are considered to be identical if they are the same size. this can be useful, for example, when copying the changelist is lost. please use caution. this option is turned off in default.</seg>
<seg id="2411">Activates the synchronization mode when two folders are compared and no destination folder is specified. in this mode, the proposals for merging are selected in such a way that afterwards both folders are identical. also the results of merging files are stored in both folders. this option is turned off in the default setting.</seg>
<seg id="2412">If there are differences, instead of merging, copying the newer file will be suggested as an action. (this is considered insecure, as it is assumed that the other file was not changed too. you should check this in any case.) This option is turned off in default.</seg>
<seg id="2413">If a file or folder is replaced or deleted by another, then the original version will be renamed and the extension .orig. If an old backup file with the .orig extension is already existing, it will be deleted without further backup. this also concerns the normal merge of individual files, not just merging entire folders.</seg>
<seg id="2414">Normally, the folder-merge view will remain visible during the merge of individual files; you can switch the window divider with the mouse. if you do not want, you can switch to the File menu and switch the main window in the window menu and switch between the two views by changing the directory & text window.</seg>
<seg id="2415">Most likely you prefer to compare a file simply by double-clicking. nevertheless, there is also a corresponding menu entry in the directory menu. you can also merge a single file directly without first having to start the folder merge. to do this, you can use the current file merge from the merge menu.</seg>
<seg id="2416">This status is lost if you re-read the directory: directory -Menu: re-read</seg>
<seg id="2417">KDE supports network transparency with the help of KIO slaves. Kdiff3 uses this to read files and folders. in this way, you can specify files and folders for opening that are located on local or remote hosts.</seg>
<seg id="2418">The first command line compares a local file with one on an FTP server. the second command line compares a folder inside a compressed archive with a local folder.</seg>
<seg id="2419">A URL has a different syntax than local files and folders. a few things you should consider:</seg>
<seg id="2420">A path can be relative and. or.. included. this is not possible with URLs, these are always absolute.</seg>
<seg id="2421">Special characters must be escaped. (# - &gt;% 23, whitespace &gt;% 20, etc.). for example, a file named / # foo # contains URL file: /% 23foo% 23.</seg>
<seg id="2422">Sometimes due to the file system on the server, sometimes through the protocol used. it follows a short list of limitations:</seg>
<seg id="2423">Or it cannot be distinguished whether a link shows a file or folder. then a file is always accepted as a link destination. (FTP:, sftp:).</seg>
<seg id="2424">There is no way to edit permissions or modification date. therefore, the permissions or the modification date will deviate from the original. (note the option Confidentity of the size.) (This is only possible with local files.)</seg>
<seg id="2425">The main purpose of use is currently as a difference viewer in KDEVELOP. KDEVELOP first always starts the built-in differences viewer. to start KDEVELOP, press the right mouse button above the difference viewer and then select In KDEVELOP view from the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="2426">Usually you need & kdiff3; two full input files. however, if it is used as a node, & kdiff3; indicates that the input file is a patch file in unified format. then remove & kdiff3; the name of the original files must exist. then start & kdiff3; the patch program to restore missing file.</seg>
<seg id="2427">In Konqueror you can click on a patch file and select Preview in - Kdiff3Part from the context menu. note that this does not work if none of the original files exists. besides, this is unreliable when the original files have changed since the patch file has been created.</seg>
<seg id="2428">If & kdiff3; as part is executed, it only supports comparing two files, a very small toolbar and menu. the merge or matching of folders is not supported in the KPart mode.</seg>
<seg id="2429">Tools with the name KDiff and Kdiff2 (now there are pairs) there are already. furthermore, the name Kdiff3 already indicates that it can merge as the program diff3 from the Diff tool collection.</seg>
<seg id="2430">I have been using GPL programs for a long time and learned a lot when I looked into the sources of other programs. this is my thanks to all programmers who have gone this path or will go that way.</seg>
<seg id="2431">You compiled the program from sources and probably didn't know the correct prefix to KDE. in default, configure configure in / usr / local, but then KDE can't find the resources for the user interfaces (e.g. kdiff3ui.rc). in the README file you will find more information on this topic.</seg>
<seg id="2432">If only the number of white characters differs, these lines are treated as identical; however, if only a non-white character is different, the line is treated as not identically. iF's similar lines disappear next to each other, this is the case.</seg>
<seg id="2433">The editor notices for each difference in the files where it starts and where it ends. this is necessary to solve a conflict simply by clicking in the source code and selecting the button A / B / C. however, this important information is lost if the result is simply stored as text file and it is too much effort to create extra a separate file format that could store this information.</seg>
<seg id="2434">The effort required for this was so far too large. you can always restore a certain version by selecting a source A / B / C. in order to process larger amounts of text, another editor should be used.</seg>
<seg id="2435">After removing text is suddenly lt; No src link; appeared and the text cannot be deleted. what does this mean and how can it be removed?</seg>
<seg id="2436">& kdiff3; used already many colors to highlight differences. even more highlighting would be confusing and missing the purpose.</seg>
<seg id="2437">Many good ideas and bug reports came from colleagues and many people from the Wild Wild Web. thank you!</seg>
<seg id="2438">To use all the functions of & kdiff3, you need & kde; 3.1 or later.</seg>
<seg id="2439">Information on how to use Kdiff3 on other platforms without KDE can be found on the homepage.</seg>
<seg id="2440">You can find a list of recent changes under http: / / kdiff3.sourceforge.net / ChangeLog or in the file ChangeLog in the source package.</seg>
<seg id="2441">To compile and install on a system with & kde, use the command in the base folder of the & kdiff3; -distribution:</seg>
<seg id="2442">KDE-dir returns the folder in your system where KDE is installed. if you are unsure, you will find more details in the README file.</seg>
<seg id="2443">Since & kdiff3; autoconf and automake uses, you should have no problems compiling. if difficulties occur, please report to the & kde; -mailinglists of them.</seg>
<seg id="2444">Cut out (Ctrl-X or Shift-Remove) copies to the clipboard and deletes the selected text. insert (Ctrl-V or Shift-Insert) insert the text from the clipboard at the current cursor position or replace the current marker.</seg>
<seg id="2445">Show only differences: files that are identical in all folders do not appear in the folder structure, and therefore also not in the destination folder.</seg>
<seg id="2446">(in the current program version, you need to reread the folder with the refresh function after changes to these options.)</seg>
<seg id="2447">This also means that identical files will not be copied to the destination folder when merging. if the destination folder doesn't already contain these files, they fail to merge. (the behavior will probably be changed in a later program version.) This option is switched off in default.</seg>
<seg id="2448">Note the buttons to select the source with the caption A, B and C below the menu bar. if you click on one of the buttons, the rows from the appropriate window are attached to the end of the selected group in the result window (if they are not already present). if the rows are already present, they will be removed by clicking on the button.</seg>
<seg id="2449">In default, this option is deactivated. differences in single characters (such as' A 'and' a ') are treated as differences in white characters.</seg>
<seg id="2450">The & Kpager; shows a thumbnail of all virtual desktops. it is quite convenient to see the running programs on the workspaces, change their size, stop them or shift them. this works both within a desktop and several.</seg>
<seg id="2451">The & Kpager; can display all virtual desktops as well as the applications running in it. applications can be selected and even moved on the desktop and others.</seg>
<seg id="2452">With the middle mouse button, windows can be moved within the & Kpager; the movement is possible both within a working area and on other workspaces.</seg>
<seg id="2453">The context menu depends on where the right mouse button is clicked: if on the empty Background of & Kpager, the context menu only has the two entries Pager set up... and End. if, however, the icon and the name of the application as well as the entries minimize, Maximize, On Desktop and End.</seg>
<seg id="2454">Maximizes the application window to the full size of the desktop. only appears when clicked on an application.</seg>
<seg id="2455">Sends the application to the selected virtual desktop. only appears when clicked on an application.</seg>
<seg id="2456">If this check box is selected, windows can be moved within the & Kpager; s with the middle mouse button on the desktop and can also be moved to other workspaces.</seg>
<seg id="2457">If this field is enabled, the & Kpager will display the names of the virtual desktops.</seg>
<seg id="2458">Tick this field allows the & Kpager to display the numbers of virtual desktops. if it is crossed together with name, the names will be provided with folder numbers, eg; 1. desktop.</seg>
<seg id="2459">If this field is checked, the background of each desktop is also displayed as background in the & Kpager.</seg>
<seg id="2460">If this field is checked, the running programs will be shown as small windows in the & Kpager. otherwise, only empty spaces will be displayed to allow them to be selected.</seg>
<seg id="2461">Here the view of the program window is selected. simply shows simple rectangles with the proportions of the program window. icon shows the windows with their standard symbol and pixmap shows a small view of the actual program window. note: Pixmap is only recommended for very fast systems.</seg>
<seg id="2462">Here the arrangement of the & Kpager; main window can be determined: classic & Kpager; in a 2xN grid, as made from pager applications in some other window managers; horizontally, all virtual desktops appear in a horizontal and vertical line, which is very good for displaying laterally on the desktop.</seg>
<seg id="2463">The & Kpager; can be used as an alternative to the pager mini program in the control bar. it has the advantage that it can be altered in size, which can display and move windows as symbols or with their contents. furthermore, it runs outside the control bar.</seg>
<seg id="2464">Right-click inside & Kpager; and then set up selector switch... allows the dialog to appear.</seg>
<seg id="2465">Currently, this cannot be changed in the Settings dialog. however, you can do this manually:</seg>
<seg id="2466">Open the file $KDEHOME / share / config / kpagerc with any text editor such as & kedit; or vi. if you do not have any write permission for the file, you must login as user root or turn to your system administrator. in this file, you must enter the key wind-transparent mode and assign it to this. possible values are:</seg>
<seg id="2467">Since & Kpager is part of the kdebase package, you need a functioning installation of the basic KDE basic packages.</seg>

<seg id="2480">& likes; is a screen loupe. you can use & kut; you can use a part of the screen as if you read a magnifying glass for the small print or the exact viewing of a photo. this application is interesting for different users: this includes artists, web designers and people with a visual impairment. this documentation should be a complete guide to the use of & kmag.</seg>
<seg id="2481">& Kmag; is a very powerful application that is constantly extended by new features. it is optimized for use on performance-sensitive machines.</seg>
<seg id="2482">When you start & collapse, a window appears as shown above. the main window of & kmag; shows the enlarged section of the screen. in the following, this window is called a magnifying window. the image that appears in the magnification window is an enlarged section of the screen and is described in the following as selection box.</seg>
<seg id="2483">In the default setting, & kmag; the area around the mouse pointer is like a mobile magnifier. alternatively, you can drag & drop a selected screen area in the magnifying window (select window) or the environment of the mouse pointer at the edge of the screen (eg, at the left edge of the screen).</seg>
<seg id="2484">If you want to avoid that the mouse cursor is displayed in the enlarged window, select the setting mouse pointer. please note that this is not yet able to detect the shape of the mouse pointer. this is always the default image; / Qt; mouse cursor.</seg>
<seg id="2485">In the selection window mode, you can adjust the selection window to your own needs. you can move it with the arrow and mouse buttons and change its size. this can be done in the following way:</seg>
<seg id="2486">Move the mouse pointer in the magnifying window and hold the left mouse button pressed, so you can capture and move the content of the magnifying window. this also goes with the arrow keys.</seg>
<seg id="2487">If you additionally press the & Shift key, press the & MMB; you can move the selection box.</seg>
<seg id="2488">This combination allows you to change the size of the selection window. note that the upper left corner of the selection window remains fixed and only the lower right corner is to be moved.</seg>
<seg id="2489">& kills; has a lot of features. you can send the enlarged picture directly to the printer, save to a file, copy to the clipboard (to insert it later into other applications), rotate the image and much more.</seg>
<seg id="2490">Stops or stops the ad update. stopping the update causes the needed CPU time to go to 0.</seg>
<seg id="2491">Select the update rate (Very low, Gering, Medium, High, Highly). the higher the update rate, the more CPU time is needed.</seg>
<seg id="2492">In this mode, a selection window will be displayed. the selected area will be displayed in a window.</seg>
<seg id="2493">& kills; automatically uses your set short commands to store files, open a new window, print, reloads (with the button again load in & konqueror;), Enlarge and reduction & etc;.</seg>

<seg id="2498">& kmousetool; emulates a mouse-click as soon as the mouse cursor persists for a while in the same place. it is meant to help people who suffer pain at the repetitive Strain Injury (RSI) Syndrome and each mouse click causes pain.</seg>
<seg id="2499">& kmousetool; can handle the pain that arises when you click the mouse and helps so many people to use the computer without pain. unfortunately, the mere moving of your computer can cause pain. if you suffer from pain associated with using your computer, you should consult a doctor if this has not yet happened.</seg>
<seg id="2500">To make it clear again: even if it helps to avoid pain caused by moving the mouse, it is useless against pain caused by moving the mouse. and as with all ergonomic aids, the result can be different for everyone.</seg>
<seg id="2501">The use of & kmousetool; is simple: & kmousetool; monitors your mouse movements and results in a click of the mouse as soon as you briefly pause the motion.</seg>
<seg id="2502">When the smart shift is enabled, makes & kmousetool; a pause after pressing the mouse button. move the mouse now, wait until the end of the motion before the release of the mouse button is executed. in this way, you can drag the drag with pressed mouse button. the smart shift requires a little exercise, but you get used to it quickly.</seg>
<seg id="2503">This residence time must be clogged after the end of the mouse movement before it executes a mouse click.</seg>
<seg id="2504">If Smart Move is enabled, the shooting time (1 / 10 s) is active. here the time is set, the & kmousetool; after pressing the mouse button the mouse button is waved before moving the mouse button again, if there is no moving of the mouse in the meantime.</seg>
<seg id="2505">This function activates a slow moving to the right and back, followed by a pause, a click with the right mouse button. a slow moving to the left and back leads a double click. these movements are started in the file $KDEHOME / share / config / kmousetool _ strokes.txt, but will be changed later.</seg>
<seg id="2506">When the sound appears delayed, you can move, move the reaction time to shorten. open the & kcontrolcenter;, go to Sound & Multimedia, select there sound system and here the tab. there is a slider sound buffer which you set to a lower value to shorten response times.</seg>
<seg id="2507">When this setting is selected, & kmousetool is started; at any start of & kde; this function is currently only available under & kde; for GNOME or other window environments, please consult the respective documentation to find out how to launch a program there automatically.</seg>
<seg id="2508">Reset all settings to the values set when you open the dialog. if you have already pressed the Apply button, the settings will be reset to the stand after the last pressing of the user.</seg>
<seg id="2509">Best use & kmousetool, first with presets. in particular, you should leave the smart move off first. if you get used to the automatic mouse click, you can later remove the smart shift.</seg>
<seg id="2510">If you use the audible click, it is necessary to reduce the response times of & kde; in the case of sounds.</seg>
<seg id="2511">First you should be aware of which places a click of the mouse remains without effect: clicking on the neutral components of windows or places in the browser window that does not represent a link does not lead to unwanted reactions. you can therefore park your mouse at such places until you want to use it again.</seg>
<seg id="2512">When your mouse clicks, you should clean your mouse. this is usually pretty simple. the trick here is that you do not only clean the mouse ball, but also the roles that come into contact with the mouse ball.</seg>
<seg id="2513">First you have to take out the mouse ball. as this happens, mouse to mouse is different, but it should be clear if you look at the bottom of the mouse.</seg>
<seg id="2514">If you have removed the ball, you would have to see the rolls. these are located on the sides of the hole in which the ball was inserted. you can easily scrape the dirt and dirt with a flat blade or fingernail.</seg>
<seg id="2515">In very rare situations, the operating system interrupts execution of & kmousetool; if you use the smart shift in this case, it means that & kmousetool; the operation can no longer be terminated by releasing the mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="2516">This happens when you use & kmousetool; use another window manager and move a window.</seg>
<seg id="2517">The solution for this problem is that you can run a mouse click by yourself. by doing so, the status of & kmousetool is reset, and you can continue working as usual.</seg>
<seg id="2518">Problem: if you enter text, try & kmousetool; continue to execute Mausklicks and place the cursor to another place.</seg>
<seg id="2519">Solution: use the mouse to place the cursor to where you want it. but park your mouse on a neutral zone of the desktop when you want to make a keyboard input. thus, an accidental moving of the mouse pointer can cause unwanted reactions.</seg>
<seg id="2520">I try to work with the intelligent shift, but I don't manage to edit text.</seg>
<seg id="2521">The smart shift is an advanced function of & kmousetool, and it takes its time before you can handle it. it is very likely in this way to copy text, copy it to the clipboard and to insert any other action where you want to move the mouse with pressed mouse button. however, it will probably only cause problems once. here are some advice on this:</seg>
<seg id="2522">Do not use the smart shift if you just start using it & kmousetool; use it as follows: drag one mouse-click on the one end of the text area and hold down the Shift key while moving the mouse pointer to the other end of the text and pressing the mouse button again.</seg>
<seg id="2523">Use the audible mouse-click. this time, when the mouse click is played, the mouse button expresses a sound like a mouse click. so you know exactly when the shift time starts when smart shifting. later, you can also use the smart shift without the audible mouse click. but for that, it requires some practice.</seg>
<seg id="2524">To use & kmousetool; use the Xtest extension for & X Window; it should be the case on most of the system.</seg>
<seg id="2525">The functionality of the audible mouse clicks is only available when the system has a sound card and speakers, and these are correctly set up.</seg>
<seg id="2526">& kmousetool; activates the mouse button as soon as the mouse cursor persists. this program has been developed for people who suffer from RSI's syndrome and who inflict pain on those of the mouse.</seg>
<seg id="2527">& kmousetool; can also be configured to wait a certain time for a drag process to start before the mouse button is left. in this way you can also drag and drop using the mouse.</seg>

<seg id="2620">Filters are one of the advanced capabilities of & ktts; for normal work with & ktts; filters are not required.</seg>
<seg id="2621">Text is processed in filters before it is sent to speech-dispatcher. it is useful for improving pronunciation, to replace spoken words or abbreviations, select a suitable language and speaker or to avoid certain shortcomings of speech synthesizers and their voices.</seg>
<seg id="2622">In order to understand the functioning of filters, it is important to know how the speech-dispatcher program works with a text. & ktts; distinguishes four types of texts.</seg>
<seg id="2623">The output of screen readers has the highest priority. it is preferred to all other orders and stops these orders. if the output of the screen reader is read, the retained orders will be resumed.</seg>
<seg id="2624">Warnings have the next priority. this level is important messages like & eg; processor is reserved too hot. a warning has priority and keeps the output of messages and normal text. these orders are resumed following the output of the warning.</seg>
<seg id="2625">Messages have the highest priority. a message interrupts normal text. & kmouth; is an example of an application that uses messages. while you can read a long text on a web page, you can talk to & kmouth; someone who just enters the room.</seg>
<seg id="2626">The rest are simple text orders. each order you receive from the card card is a text order. KSayit is an example of an application that uses text orders. text orders are intended for the output of longer texts that do not have any special urgency.</seg>
<seg id="2627">All four types of orders are processed in queue, with the exception of the output of Screen Readers. if an application sends the output of a screen reader, while & ktts; just one such reads, this output is stopped and finished.</seg>
<seg id="2628">First, you need to know that filters will never be applied to the output of Screen Readers. they are applied to normal alerts, messages and text orders as well as on & kde; messages.</seg>
<seg id="2629">Filter the text and pass it on to the next filter. currently, there are three types of filters.</seg>
<seg id="2630">Filters are designed as modules. in the future there can be even more types of filters.</seg>
<seg id="2631">Strings replace parts of a text by other text. the parts to be replaced can either be delivered as words or as regular expressions.</seg>
<seg id="2632">& XML; converters use an XSLT file (XML; Style Language - Transforms) to convert & XML; from one format to another format. included & ktts; are some XSLT files to translate & XHTML; included in SSML.</seg>
<seg id="2633">With subscriber selection filters you can send orders depending on the content of the text or depending on the program that has sent the text to & ktts. for example, if you have set a female voice on the card card speaker, you can read text from KDE messages about it. read more.</seg>
<seg id="2634">Each of these filters has adjustable rules, after which it is applied to a speech output. if the filter detects that its rules do not apply, the text continues to pass the text to the next filter.</seg>
<seg id="2635">When a text order, a message, warning or a & kde; notification is sent to & ktts; sent, it is processed by all activated filters that have been set up on the bottom. processing by the filters takes place in the order in the list from top to bottom.</seg>
<seg id="2636">This shows the list of established normal filters. if a filter is not checked, it is not activated and is not used. filters are executed from top to bottom.</seg>
<seg id="2637">Click here to insert a new filter. select the type of filter and the following setup dialogs are displayed.</seg>
<seg id="2638">For the set-up filters you have to enter a list of words or regular expressions as comparison samples. if these patterns are found in the text, then the text will be replaced with the corresponding substitute text.</seg>
<seg id="2639">Enter a name for your filter. you can choose this name arbitrarily, it only has to differ from the names of the other filters.</seg>
<seg id="2640">This is the list of words and regular expressions. the filter compares the text with the strings in the column and replaces it in accordance with the string from the column Replace. the list is processed in the displayed order from top to bottom.</seg>
<seg id="2641">Click here to move the selected word or regular expression in the list.</seg>
<seg id="2642">With these buttons you can load a list of words or regular expressions from a file, save or delete the current list. load a list of a file, the entries will be appended from the file to the existing list.</seg>
<seg id="2643">If a language is entered here, the filter will only be used if the speaker speaks for the text order one of the languages listed here. click the button to view a list of languages. you can also select multiple languages if you press the & Ctrl; key pressed while clicking.</seg>
<seg id="2644">If a value is entered here, the filter will only be used if the text is from one of the specified applications. you can enter multiple programs separated by comma. example: conversation, kmail</seg>
<seg id="2645">The application ID of running programs can be obtained with the program qdbus; the & dbus; -Numbers must be omitted. if for example, the Application ID Copete-3432 indicates, you may only enter a copy.</seg>

<seg id="2677">The speech-dispatcher program uses an adaptable module architecture for voice synthesizers. if you would like to extend the use of another synthesizer, contact the developer team.</seg>
<seg id="2678">The program xsltproc is used for the support of SSML and for the & XML; -conversion filter, but is not mandatory. Debian users can install xsltproc with the command apt-get install xsltproc.</seg>
<seg id="2679">To compile and compile, you need a current development environment of KDE (version 3.4 or newer) including the cdelibs package and the development files for the speech "speech patcher."</seg>
<seg id="2680">If you have the source code from & ktts; from the source code archive for disable or download the tarball created every night, compile and install the program with the following commands:</seg>
<seg id="2681">Before you use & ktts, check first if speech-Dispatcher works correctly with your voice synthesizer. to do so, you can use the shell script spd-conf.</seg>
<seg id="2682">& ktts; in & kde; 4.4 is the first version of ktts; the program kttmsgr is to be developed so that the creation of speech discs is directly possible and the script sph-conf is no longer needed.</seg>
<seg id="2683">A long text is disassembled into individual sentences. the user can leave the set or paragraph style, repeat the output, pause or cancel the output.</seg>
<seg id="2684">If an application puts text on & ktts, you can specify the properties of the preferred speaker for the output. if you have set up a speaker, whose language is English and its gender is female, it is used, otherwise the best matching speaker is chosen automatically. if you want to learn more about it, how & tts; a speaker chooses, look at.</seg>
<seg id="2685">When you click Add a spokesman on the Add-on tab or click Edit, the box is displayed in the list of speakers. for example, the setup of the module for Festival Interactive will be shown below. for details on the modules, see below.</seg>

<seg id="2687">Select the character encoding for text that will be passed to Festival. if there are voices that & ktts; known, this setting is automatically done. generally, Western languages use ISO 8859-1, Eastern languages such as Czech or Slovak use ISO 8859-2.</seg>
<seg id="2688">With these sliders, you adjust volume, speech speed and pitch of the synthetic language. if you cannot select some controls and display this grey, the voice you choose will not allow these settings.</seg>
<seg id="2689">Some voices like MultiSyn voices need to be loaded several seconds due to their size. if you select this check box, these voices are already loaded at the start of KTTSD so that the first set will be synthesized faster (with larger memory consumption).</seg>
<seg id="2690">If this check box cannot be selected, you have not yet set up a speaker (or click Apply). see.</seg>
<seg id="2691">If this check box is selected, the kttsmgr program window will be displayed when starting with kttsmgr. otherwise, after the start, only the kttsmgr icon in the system section is visible, but not the program window. click on the icon in the system section to view the program window.</seg>
<seg id="2692">If this check box is selected and kttsmgr is not running yet, it will appear in the system area as soon as KTTSD reads a text. this allows you to pause or otherwise control the preview.</seg>

<seg id="2703">On this card card you can set up special actions that are always executed when the text order is interrupted by a higher priority message.</seg>
<seg id="2704">The output of screen readers has the highest priority. it is preferred to all other orders and stops these orders. once the output of the screen reader is read, the retained orders are resumed.</seg>
<seg id="2705">Warnings have the highest priority. this level is important news such as & eg; processor is reserved too hot. a warning keeps the output of messages and normal text. these orders are resumed following the warning of the warning.</seg>
<seg id="2706">Messages have the next priority. a message interrupts normal text. & kmouth; is an example of an application that speaks messages. if you & eg; just read a long text on a web page, you can come with & mouth; still welcome someone who is entering the room.</seg>
<seg id="2707">A text order is interrupted by a message, warning or output of a screen reader, adds & ktts; the audio output into the queue.</seg>

<seg id="2722">The Speech Synthesis Markup Language (SSML) is a W3C standard to highlight text for voice output. this standard contains marks for controlling voices, speaking speed, volume, sex of voice and pitch.</seg>
<seg id="2723">Currently supported & ktts; SSML only partly and only in basic functions. the following restrictions are available:</seg>
<seg id="2724">You need to install the rab _ diphone voice (British male) since this is the default voice that uses the festival in the output of SSML.</seg>
<seg id="2725">If the settings for speed or pitch in the festival configuration dialog are not set to 100, SSML text is usually spoken very monotonously.</seg>

<seg id="2727">There are two types of filters - normal filters and set-level detection filters (SDB filters). this allows & ktts to start faster with reading, since only the first set has to be synthesized, not the entire text order.</seg>
<seg id="2728">Here you can see the propositional filter. at the first launch of & ktts, a set of propositional filters is set up automatically. you can change its settings or add more propositional filters, but beginners will be advised of this.</seg>
<seg id="2729">The easiest way to learn is to set up the language selection by going out. switch off the language selection and enter text to read. check on the box menu assignments, which spokesman & ktops; choose. turn on the speaker selection again, change some features and check how to set up the speaker's selection, otherwise the filter is ineffective.</seg>
<seg id="2730">& ktts; then you can start reading faster, because only the first set needs to be processed and not the whole text block, which can take a very long time,</seg>
<seg id="2731">You can then pause or cancel text orders on the card card, even if the voice synthesizer does not support this function.</seg>
<seg id="2732">For these reasons, the normal set-level recognition filter is set up automatically when you start kttsmgr for the first time. it cannot be switched off, only removed. do not change anything in this filter unless you know what you are doing.</seg>
<seg id="2733">Punctuation Recognition Filters compare text with a regular expression for propositional phrases and add a tabulation mark (decimal code 8) to the propositional boundaries (tab characters are automatically removed from the text before filtering). note that the standard propositional filter retains the character set.</seg>
<seg id="2734">SBD filters are never applied to & kde; -Messages, warnings, messages or the output of screen readers.</seg>
<seg id="2735">If you have removed the normal propositional filter, you can paste it again by loading the standard _ sbdrc file contained in & ktts.</seg>
<seg id="2736">On the card card box selection, you can override the subscriber settings for the application.</seg>
<seg id="2737">Use of the standard speaker (the top on the card card speaker). in other words: no talkative properties are specified.</seg>
<seg id="2738">Use of the most appropriate speaker that displays all the features of a set-up speaker. if you do not delete or edit the settings of the speaker, choose & ktts; otherwise select & ktts; otherwise select & ktts; the speaker that best meets the originally set properties.</seg>
<seg id="2739">Select the method to enter the desired speech properties by clicking on one of the selection buttons.</seg>
<seg id="2740">Select the properties of the desired speaker here. if this feature doesn't matter, don't enter anything.</seg>
<seg id="2741">Mark this check box if the property is to take precedence over other properties. you can also set several markers here.</seg>
<seg id="2742">Since the language is a critical factor in publishing the output, it is always used as a priority feature. you will rarely use this feature. the only case where you might want to specify the attribute language is before you know that a particular application will send text in another language than the one in the working environment.</seg>
<seg id="2743">To use all the features in the speaker, most likely to delete the following, click on the standard speaker icon and then use the speaker, which is closest to the following.</seg>
<seg id="2744">In this case 0 is for the last text order in the queue. you can also specify a order number. (no order number is required 0).</seg>
<seg id="2745">Kttsmgr stops immediately when it is started. I compiled Debug support, but I don't get back tracking.</seg>
<seg id="2746">GStreamer 0.8.x is finished. you probably need to register GStreamer. if the problem is not resolved by this, a non-compatible version of GStreamer is installed. you can try to update or uninstall GStreamer.</seg>
<seg id="2747">The audio output over ALSA does not work if I play music simultaneously with another application. if I receive a text order, Friert & ktts; a. on the & Console; appears a message stating: Unable to open PCM.</seg>
<seg id="2748">On your system, the problem is that there are conflicts with ALSA, which prevent the simultaneous opening of multiple PCM devices. please refer to the ALSA project (dmix) on the website of the ALSA project (dmix) at www.alsa-project.org.</seg>
<seg id="2749">I uploaded an additional voice for festival from the Internet. I installed it and can use it in festival, but kttsmgr does not show this voice.</seg>
<seg id="2750">Add the new voice in the $KDEHOME / share / apps / kttsd / festivalint / resume file. if that is successful, please send a patch along with the & URL; where you found the voice to the developers.</seg>
<seg id="2751">The program sox must be installed and can be retrieved via the PATH environment variable. some synthesizers such as Festival Interactive even offer a setting for speed on the card card for subscriber setup. depending on the selected voice, it is active or inactive.</seg>
<seg id="2752">The settings for the speech speed are ignored when & ktts; & HTML; read. (this is because the HTML is converted into SSML.) Deactivate either the filter for the conversion of & HTML; (see) or, if you are quite bold, change the .xsl file of the & HTML; -after-SSML enformerfilter, and set up the speech speed.</seg>
<seg id="2753">I don't manage to read websites with a female voice. I have created a female festival speaker, but & ktts; reads the web pages with a male voice.</seg>
<seg id="2754">At Festival 1.95 beta, the day Sable GENDER does not seem to work. so that the festival does not produce any errors, the xsl file rejects the GENDER-Tags for converting SSML to Saber. same also applies to the VOICE tags.</seg>
<seg id="2755">I have added an own string of assertion filter and now I can go back or forth in & ktts; no longer set-up or go back. on the tab order is displayed, the order consists only of one sentence. what am I doing wrong?</seg>
<seg id="2756">Punctuation marks (dot, question mark, exclamation mark, comma and semicolon) are not allowed to filter out. instead, use a filter for propositional character recognition.</seg>
<seg id="2757">Alsa (Advanced & Linux; Sound Architecture). Alsa is on most systems with & Linux; already installed. (www.alsa-project.org)</seg>
<seg id="2758">GStreamer in version 0.8.7 or later. note: make sure the GStreamer modules are registered by using GStreamer in & ktts; use the command-register command before using GStreamer. (HTTP: / / gaspamer.freedesktop.org)</seg>
<seg id="2759">Some users experience in connection with ALSA conflicts in audio output. if your system also counts, you cannot play music at the same time and read a text. & ktts; also freezes when you stop a text order and then start another. you can find possible solutions for this problem on the ALSA (dmix) website.</seg>
<seg id="2760">As of July 2005, aKode does not support real breaks. if you hold a text order in & ktts, the current sentence is still read.</seg>
<seg id="2761">The sox audio program is used for the general setting of speech speed, but is otherwise not mandatory. Debian users can install sox with the command apt-get install sox. the program is included on most & Linux; -CDs already.</seg>

<seg id="2798">This manual explains the installation and use of & knetworkconf;, a module for the & kcontrolcenter, which allows management of network interfaces, routing and DNS settings.</seg>
<seg id="2799">The & kcontrolcenter; allows the user to manage a set of system and desktop settings via a unified, integrated surface. the & kcontrolcenter; can be accessed by selecting K Menu kcontrolcenter;</seg>
<seg id="2800">The & knetworkconf; package was developed to allow users to manage the TCP / IP network settings in the same way as other settings from the & knetworkconf; create a simple interface for the user for the following tasks:</seg>
<seg id="2801">After the installation, a new module network settings are displayed in the & kcontrolcenter; the module network settings (knetworkconf;) can be started by selecting kcontrolcenter; Internet & Network network settings in & KMenu;</seg>
<seg id="2802">It is important to understand that & knetworkconf; network hardware cannot be installed. physical devices and their drivers must already be installed and configured, so that & knetworkconf; the device generally displays and allows setting of network features.</seg>
<seg id="2803">In most cases, drivers for network hardware and other devices are installed and installed. if network devices are added later, the drivers need to be loaded by adapting the following files according to the kernel version:</seg>
<seg id="2804">The Network Setting module is loaded when the option to select network settings in the & kcontrolcenter; index. when starting module network settings, this will automatically detect the platform used on the system.</seg>
<seg id="2805">If the platform cannot be detected, the manual selection is offered. it is the platform to choose from the list that best matches the distribution and release point. by selecting the setting non-again questions, the definition can be made permanently.</seg>
<seg id="2806">Changing the network settings is only possible in system management mode. previously, all options are displayed gray, meaning the settings can only be viewed, changing is not possible. in the system administration mode, you enter system management mode at the bottom of the module by clicking the button. it is necessary to enter the password.</seg>
<seg id="2807">In the system management mode, the entire functionality of the module is available. this is divided into three tabs:</seg>
<seg id="2808">The Network Interface Panel serves to manage network devices of the system. all available network devices are displayed. the following tasks can be performed by the rider network interfaces:</seg>
<seg id="2809">The settings of network interfaces that are displayed can be set up by selecting the desired device in the list and clicking the button... in the Device Dialog Device.</seg>
<seg id="2810">By default, only basic TCP / IP settings are available. click the Advanced Settings button to display the dialog with further options.</seg>
<seg id="2811">By selecting Automatically the TCP / IP settings are fetched from a DHCP server or BOOTP server. in automatic mode, the TCP / IP settings for the system are performed at the same time with the start of the system services. the DHCP or BOOTP server sends all necessary TCP / IP information at every system start so no further adjustment is required. either DHCP or BOOTP, according to the system, can be selected.</seg>
<seg id="2812">In the input field IP address, the desired TCP / IP address must be specified. in the netmask input field, the subnet mask must be specified.</seg>
<seg id="2813">If this setting is selected, the system initializes the network interface during booting. if the initialization is not desired, this option should not be activated.</seg>
<seg id="2814">The values entered in this dialog are displayed as properties of the device in the device list.</seg>
<seg id="2815">It should be ensured that the IP address in the network is not already used. entering an already existing IP address would lead to a TCP / IP conflict. with ping in the & console, you can determine if the desired address is already in use. in doubt the network administrator should be asked.</seg>
<seg id="2816">Network devices can be activated or disabled according to your needs. switching on an outdated network device is activated by selecting from the list and clicking on the interface....</seg>
<seg id="2817">Network devices can be activated or disabled according to your needs. switching off an activated network device can be deactivated by selecting from the list and clicking the interface.</seg>
<seg id="2818">Defines the host's IP address in the local subnet, which conveys the physical connection to remote networks and is used by default for TCP / IP communication with computers in other subnets.</seg>
<seg id="2819">If there is more than one network interface on the computer, the interface to the network in which the gateway computer is located must be selected.</seg>
<seg id="2820">A computer with DNS support replaces a full domain name by the corresponding IP address. this is necessary because computers can only understand IP addresses. if the machine asks http: / / www.einedomain.org, DNS will solve this name in an IP address like 123.45.678.90.</seg>
<seg id="2821">The name resolution part of the name resolution calculator allows for easy management of this list. entries can be added, removed or altered. DNS records can be renamed to the list by selecting an entry and / or downgrading in the list with buttons.</seg>
<seg id="2822">By clicking the button Add... a DNS server can be added from the group hosts to the name resolution. it will be added to the New Name Server dialog.</seg>
<seg id="2823">First you need to enter the IP address of the DNS server and then click the Add button. the entry will then be inserted in the list.</seg>
<seg id="2824">From the group calculator to the name resolution, select an entry and then click the Edit button.... There will be the Edit dialog.</seg>
<seg id="2825">The list of known calculators describes machine name-to-IP address links for the TCP / IP subsystem. it is used primarily for booting when no DNS servers are available. in small, remote networks, it can replace DNS servers.</seg>
<seg id="2826">Usually the list of names well known hosts some entries, the & apos; localhostapos; and some special IPv6 addresses. this still in the test version of IP should replace version 4 in the future.</seg>
<seg id="2827">Enter the IP address of the known computer and click Add.... The New alias dialog will be displayed.</seg>
<seg id="2828">Enter the name of the known machine and click the Add button. if the known machine has several alias names, press the Add button several times and enter the other alias names.</seg>
<seg id="2829">Select an entry of a name known by name from the list and select Edit.... The dialog Considering Calculator will be displayed.</seg>
<seg id="2830">It can be performed one of the following tasks, then clicking OK will update the list of static hosts.</seg>
<seg id="2831">The settings made in the Network Setting module are not immediately effective in the system. to activate the changes you need to use the following command.</seg>
<seg id="2832">The home page of & knetworkconf; is http: / / knetworkconf.sourceforge.net, from which you can download the latest version of the source code.</seg>
<seg id="2833">For the installation of binary distributions (usually rpm packages) it is enough, if & kde; and Qt installed.</seg>
<seg id="2834">The installation of the finished compiled version is recommended for less experienced users. it is easy to download the rpm package and install it in a & Console; with rpm as follows:</seg>
<seg id="2835">Alternatively, a graphical interface can be used as a package or the installation tool of your distribution.</seg>
<seg id="2836">For this case, the installation of Qt and & kde is sufficient; in addition, the development packages are needed with libraries and other things.</seg>
<seg id="2837">This is recommended only to experienced users, but it is not difficult to compile & knetwork.conf. the following commands should do this.</seg>
<seg id="2838">In the first section of this chapter, important information about basic network technology will be given, in the second section all of the & knetworkconf, changing configuration files will be discussed.</seg>
<seg id="2839">This section cannot replace further knowledge of IP networks. in this appendix, only basic information about the integration of the PC is conveyed into a small (home) network.</seg>
<seg id="2840">IP networks are currently being operated using TCP / IP version 4 (IPv4). IPv5 has never found widespread use. IPv6 is expected to continue in the near future.</seg>
<seg id="2841">One of the most important information is the IP address of a network interface. in foreign networks, at & eg; workplace, the network administrator is the contact point, which provides a valid IP address or if available, DHCP can be used. in any case, the IP address cannot be chosen freely.</seg>
<seg id="2842">When setting up an own small (home) network, the IP address should be selected from a dedicated area reserved for this purpose to avoid IP address conflicts with the global (Internet) network.</seg>
<seg id="2843">Of course, access to the Internet for such machines can be made possible by setting a gateways.</seg>
<seg id="2844">For smaller networks addresses in the area of 192.168.1.1 to 192.168.1.254 are used. the area is large enough for networks up to 250 computers.</seg>
<seg id="2845">In addition, the netmask is usually set to 255.255.255.0 so that all hosts are in the same subnet.</seg>
<seg id="2846">Some addresses are reserved for special things, 0.0eg; .0.0 and 127.0.0.1. the first is the so-called standard route, the second is the loopback address (localhost = your own computer). the default route is required for the IP forwarding.</seg>
<seg id="2847">The network address 127.0.0.1 is reserved for IP traffic in the local machine. normally, the address 127.0.0.1 is assigned to a custom loopback interface that works like a closed circuit.</seg>
<seg id="2848">This section contains the configuration files that are affected by & knetwork.conf and where they are stored in the various distributions.</seg>
<seg id="2849">This file is sometimes dynamically changed for DSL connections, so it will not be surprised if there is a different content found in the case of active DSL connections.</seg>
<seg id="2850">For & SuSE; it is known that this file is randomly sorted by the scripts in the SuSE system. a different stand than expected can therefore occur.</seg>

<seg id="2893">& kdat; is a backup program for tape drives based on tar. it provides the ability to store multiple archives on a tape. the first was to create a surface for tar which also provided the ability of dds2tar for quick, selective package. the second goal was to answer a question that my wife asked: how much longer does it take if you secure?</seg>
<seg id="2894">Before a tape can be used, it must be included in & kdat; it can happen in three ways:</seg>
<seg id="2895">& kdat; give the tape back and read the pre-tensioning information of the tape. detect & kdat; don't know the template on the tape, you'll be asked if the tape is to be formatted.</seg>
<seg id="2896">Recognizes & kdat; the template, it looks for the appropriate index on your disk. if it cannot be found, you'll be asked if the band index should be recreated.</seg>
<seg id="2897">If everything went smoothly, the symbol for the tape drive changes to indicate that the tape was involved. in the status bar a corresponding message appears. the contents of the tape can now be browsed by folding the entry for the band.</seg>
<seg id="2898">Before ejecting the tape, the integration must first be solved. there are three methods to accomplish this:</seg>
<seg id="2899">& kdat; shows through a change of the symbol for the tape that the integration for the tape has been resolved and shows a corresponding message in the status bar. the tape can now be ejected without danger.</seg>
<seg id="2900">Before a tape can be used by & kdat; it must be formatted by & kdat;</seg>
<seg id="2901">A tape file must be formatted before you can be used to store data. if your tape drive assumes that a tape has to be formatted before use, this must happen before you can format the tape from & kdat; Floppy drives usually require formatting of the tape, while DAT drives do not.</seg>
<seg id="2902">After entering the band name and the capacity, the tape continues. all data on the tape is lost! after completion of the formatting process, the tape is automatically integrated and ready to use.</seg>
<seg id="2903">Before you initiate the backup process, you need to select the files to be secured, which can happen in three ways:</seg>
<seg id="2904">Select a file or folder in the local file tree. it will only backup this file or folder.</seg>
<seg id="2905">Select a backup profile in the tree. only the files specified in the profile are backed up.</seg>
<seg id="2906">Select files in the local file tree with a hook. only the selected files and / or subfolders will be backed up.</seg>
<seg id="2907">Rightclick the local file tree and select Save...</seg>
<seg id="2908">Once the backup has been started, the Settings dialog opens. in this dialog you can check the selected files again and change the backup settings.</seg>
<seg id="2909">When you have confirmed the settings, the dialog box appears. the dialog displays the progress of the backup process, including the data rate and the remaining time.</seg>
<seg id="2910">Select a file or folder in one of the archives in the entry for the drive. only the selected file or folder will be checked.</seg>
<seg id="2911">Select the files in one of the archives in the entry for the tape with a hook. only the selected files and / or subfolders are checked.</seg>
<seg id="2912">Rightclick in any of the archives and select the menu item Check....</seg>
<seg id="2913">Once the verification process has been started, the dialog appears for review. in this dialog you can check your selection once again and change the working folder for verification.</seg>
<seg id="2914">If you have confirmed the settings for the verification, the dialog will be checked. this dialog displays the progress of the audit process as well as the data throughput and the remaining time.</seg>
<seg id="2915">Before you can initiate the restore, the files to be recovered must be selected. this can be done in two ways:</seg>
<seg id="2916">Select a file or folder in one of the archives belonging to the tape drive. only the selected file or subfolder will be restored.</seg>
<seg id="2917">Select the files you want from one of the archives with a hook. only the selected files and / or subfolders will be restored.</seg>
<seg id="2918">Rightclick a file or folder in one of the archives and select Restore in the Menu...</seg>
<seg id="2919">Once the restore process has been started, the dialog will display settings for recovery. in this dialog, you can check your selection once again and change the working folder for recovery.</seg>
<seg id="2920">Once you have confirmed the restore settings, the dialog will appear. this dialog displays the progress of the restore process as well as the data throughput and the remaining time.</seg>
<seg id="2921">Sometimes it proves to be necessary to recreate the tape index on the basis of the tape content. this procedure deletes all existing index files for this band. you can create the index on two types of the tape:</seg>
<seg id="2922">This creates a backup profile with the currently selected files and the default settings. you can set the following settings for a backup profile:</seg>
<seg id="2923">The current working folder where the backup is to take place. the list of files to be secured will be automatically updated according to the currently selected working folder.</seg>
<seg id="2924">For all folders specified in backup files, only the files that reside on the same filesystem, like the folder. folders that are on other file systems, can be entered separately under backup files. each entry is considered by tar regardless of the other file system.</seg>
<seg id="2925">Perform an incremental backup. to determine which files have changed since the last incremental backup, a snapshot file is used. only the files that have changed since then are backed up.</seg>
<seg id="2926">The name of the file used to determine the changes since the last incremental backup.</seg>
<seg id="2927">Deletes the snapshot file before calling tar. this causes all files to be backed up and a new snapshot file is created for the next backup.</seg>
<seg id="2928">The functionality of the buttons files & gt; & gt; & gt; & gt; & gt; & gt; & gt; & gt; & gt;</seg>
<seg id="2929">The settings can be set up via the menu item KDat... in the Settings menu. the following settings can be done:</seg>
<seg id="2930">The complete path to the device file for the tape drive (usually / dev / tape). this path must refer to the non-rewinding option of the tape device.</seg>
<seg id="2931">If this setting is active, send and kdat; before the tape is involved, load load to the drive. for some drives, this is necessary before read or write operations can be performed.</seg>
<seg id="2932">If the option is turned on, try & kdat; unlock the throw of the tape drive. possibly this setting does not work with all tape drives.</seg>
<seg id="2933">If the option is turned on, when unplugging the & kdat record, the band will be automatically ejected. do not use this option for floppy-streamer.</seg>
<seg id="2934">If the option is turned on, try & kdat; not all drives support variable block sizes. not all drives support variable block sizes. no matter if this setting is active or not, you need & kdat; in any case, tell the block size for your tape drive.</seg>
<seg id="2935">If & kdat; a tape formatted, it writes a file to the beginning of the tape. this file should only occupy a memory block on the tape. the contents of the file is composed as follows:</seg>
<seg id="2936">(n Byte) The band ID. the format of this string is hostname: seconds, where the hostname is the complete name of the system on which the tape was formatted. seconds is the number of seconds that have passed since the period in which the tape was formatted.</seg>
<seg id="2937">The band ID is used to find a file with the same name in the $HOME / .kdat file.</seg>
<seg id="2938">The remaining files on the tape are pure tar archives, which can be administrated directly with & GNU; even other tar versions should work as long as they are not incremental backups.</seg>
<seg id="2939">Check the contents of a backup tape. this symbol is only active when a tape is involved.</seg>
<seg id="2940">& ksystemlog; is a & kde; Viewer for System Logs. the program is suitable for inexperienced users who do not know where to get information about your system, or where the system stores the different protocol files. furthermore, & ksystemlog allows users to quickly access information about problems that occur on their server.</seg>
<seg id="2941">& ksystemlog; helps users understand what your computer is doing in the background. the task of & ksystemlog; is a simplified representation of the protocol files of your own system. the program is suitable for inexperienced users who do not know where to get information about your system or where the system stores the different protocol files.</seg>
<seg id="2942">In addition, & ksystemlog allows experienced users to quickly access information about problems that occur on their server. & ksystemlog; hence, attempts to provide some advanced functions that allow the protocol files to be filtered and evaluated by specific programs.</seg>
<seg id="2943">The current version 0.4.1 has & ksystemlog; a number of useful functions. among other things, this includes:</seg>
<seg id="2944">Support for many different types of log files, for the format of the Syslog server and for Samba</seg>
<seg id="2945">Many other functions are also included and are explained in the further chapters of this manual.</seg>
<seg id="2946">As you see in the following screenshot, & ksystemlog provides functions to easily filter and sort the individual protocol lines of a protocol file. the individual options for sorting and filtering are shown in the next chapter of this manual.</seg>
<seg id="2947">After the start tries & ksystemlog; first the most important protocol file of the system - to open the system protocol. if you don't see it, and it opens instead of its a small message window, you have & ksystemlog; very probably not with system administrator rights. the protocol files are usually found in the folder / var / log, for normal users usually do not have permission to read.</seg>
<seg id="2948">You can also use the filter strip to filter after a selected criterion or by input strings. the list of the log-lines will now be changed automatically, so that only the protocol lines match the filter. in the default setting, a log line will only be displayed if the string of the filter search term is contained in one of the columns.</seg>
<seg id="2949">You can of course select another entry at this point. the string of the filter search term will then be compared only with the entries in the corresponding column. for example, select the process column in the protocol file system log, and enter the name of a process in the protocol file system log, so show you & ksystemlog; all the protocol lines that were sent or created by this process.</seg>
<seg id="2950">This option is enabled in the default setting and helps you to recognize the important protocol lines. protocol lines of level errors are displayed with a more eye-catching color than minutes lines of the level critic. the colored representation of minutes lines can be turned off setup dialog.</seg>
<seg id="2951">If you want to display only certain processes (for example in the system protocol or in the Cron protocol), you can hide the process identification (PID) in the process column. this can be useful, for example, if you want to examine the output of a particular command such as the start of the samba server. in this case, use Filter Panel.</seg>
<seg id="2952">In addition, you can select the option To skip new lines in the main window context menu to view all the new lines that are added.</seg>
<seg id="2953">& ksystemlog; allows to display multiple protocol files in separate subwindows. to use this feature, use the entries in the window to open and manage additional sub-windows. once you have selected a sub-window, select a protocol to display in the menu.</seg>
<seg id="2954">& ksystemlog; has its own website on http: / / ksystemlog.forum-software.org. dort you can find more up-to-date information about the sources of & ksystemlog;.</seg>
<seg id="2955">& ksystemlog; also find in the following folder of the & kde; Subversion archive: ksystemlog; in & kde; archive</seg>
<seg id="2956">Welcome to the & kde; System V Init Editor, rather known (and named in the following) as & ksysv; This section introduces a few concepts and describes what you can do with & ksysv.</seg>
<seg id="2957">The system V Init quickly becomes the standard for the control of program starts when launching the system in the & Linux world. this is because it is easier to use, more powerful and at the same time more flexible than the traditional BSD Init.</seg>
<seg id="2958">Here I will not go further into historical aspects (e.g. because I don't know about it myself: -).</seg>
<seg id="2959">The init binary file is below / sbin and not under / etc. this is important because maybe someone might try to change a machine to System V Init without reinstalling and reformatting. so you must make sure that the old Init file was removed from there if there was one.</seg>
<seg id="2960">The SysV Init also differs from the BSD Init, that the configuration files are located in a subfolder of / etc instead of directly in / etc. this folder is called rc.sysinit and the following folders:</seg>
<seg id="2961">Init.d contains a whole lot of scripts. basically you need a script for every system service you want to start when you boot up the system or when switching to another runlevel. system services do not include such things as network, NFS, & Sendmail;, httpd & etc; system services do not include such things as setserial, which is only started once. such calls belong to rc.local.</seg>
<seg id="2962">Rc.local should be in / etc / rc.d if you need it. most systems have this file, even if there is not much use for it. you can also create a rc.serial in / etc / rc.d if you want to do something with the serial port.</seg>
<seg id="2963">The kernel looks at different places after the program init and starts the first one that it finds.</seg>
<seg id="2964">The default runlevel is entered in / etc / inittab. you should see in the beginning section a line like the following:</seg>
<seg id="2965">At this point, you can take a look at the second column and probably find that the default RunLevel 3 is 3. if you want to change that, you can edit / etc / inittab from hand and change the 3. if you have confused something, then you can fix it by rebooting the system and executing the following:</seg>
<seg id="2966">But how does all the correct scripts now start? if you type ls -l in rc3.d, then you'll probably see something like the following:</seg>
<seg id="2967">You will notice that there are no real files in this folder. instead, each entry is a link to one of the scripts in the init.d directory.</seg>
<seg id="2968">How to start and stop init actually system services? quite simple: each of the scripts is written in such a way that it accepts an argument like start and stop. you can actually start these scripts manually on the command line as follows:</seg>
<seg id="2969">This would stop the httpd server. init reads the name, and if it contains a K, the script will be called with the argument stop. if it contains an S, the script will be called with the argument start.</seg>
<seg id="2970">Some people want a simple way to set up machines for many purposes. I could have a server runlevel that only httpd, & Sendmail;, network & etc; run. furthermore, I could also have a user runlevel, which & eg; & kdm;, network & etc; starts.</seg>
<seg id="2971">Here you learn the use of & ksysv; it should not be very difficult because the program was designed as user-friendly as possible.</seg>
<seg id="2972">The use of & ksysv; with a mouse or another pointing device is easy to not say trivial: simply drag an entry from the area of available system services to one of the six runlevel to start it at this level (or stop).</seg>
<seg id="2973">You can also move scripts between Runleveln or change the position within a level by moving it somewhere else. the entry is removed from its original Runlevel (or its position). this only happens if you pull out an entry from the area of available system services.</seg>
<seg id="2974">Note: entries will be moved when you move them to a new area. to simply copy them to a new run level, you must explicitly select Copy from the Edit menu or from the context menu and paste into the target area -- even when the same entry has existed previously in the target range of the action.</seg>
<seg id="2975">The sorting number of an entry can sometimes not be calculated. in such a case, you need to edit the sorting numbers of the surrounding items before you can again try to insert the system service.</seg>
<seg id="2976">Note: currently there is no way to restore entries thrown into the recycle bin. so be careful.</seg>
<seg id="2977">You can use the tab key to activate the different working areas (Available system services, RunLevel 1 Start, RunLevel 1 Stop & etc;) as well as the cursor keys to make a selection above or below the previous one.</seg>
<seg id="2978">To move an entry to another runlevel, move it with cut into the clipboard (you can also use Ctrl; X) and insert it into the desired runlevel with inserting (with Ctrl + V).</seg>
<seg id="2979">To change the sorting number or the name of an entry manually, press the input key to change the Properties dialog. use the tab key to switch between different fields. close the dialog by pressing the input key to accept the changes, or press Esc to discard the changes.</seg>
<seg id="2980">Because of the danger of data loss, all entries in the File menu require a confirmation before they are executed.</seg>
<seg id="2981">All settings are saved in $KDEHOME / share / config / ksysvrc. defaults are retrieved from the global file ($KDEDIR / share / config / ksysvrc) if it is available. otherwise they are recovered by & ksysv; changes to the default settings are stored in a local ksysvrc.</seg>
<seg id="2982">I experimented with the standard Runleveln, and now the machine boots up constantly. what can I do?</seg>
<seg id="2983">Enter the LILO prompt linux single and press the input key to start in single-user mode. then edit the file / etc / inittab and change the default runlevel to a reasonable value (3 should be fine).</seg>
<seg id="2984">I have some system services with & ksysv; designed for run level X, but they are not executed.</seg>
<seg id="2985">If you use & SuSE; or Delix (DLD) then you need to edit additional files in / etc that are only available in these distributions.</seg>
<seg id="2986">The way system services are started in these distributions, simplifies the configuration for the proprietary set-up programs of these distributions, but unfortunately does not meet any standard. authors of & ksysv; plan an extension of the program for this approach.</seg>
<seg id="2987">If you are using another distribution, please check that all configuration files are present, which are required by the respective system service (and also if they are in the right directory). some services (such as & eg; Apache and httpd) simply exit without message if their configuration files are not present or incorrectly set up.</seg>
<seg id="2988">The importance of the & Linux; -Runlevel varies from distribution to distribution, can even be different from version to version. if you are using another distribution, please send me information about the runlevel so that this manual can be added to this manual.</seg>
<seg id="2989">This documentation refers to & kuser; 1.0. with this program you can manage the users and groups of your system.</seg>
<seg id="2990">To start with & kuser, it is sufficient to read the chapter adaptation of & kuser; to read.</seg>
<seg id="2991">After you have made changes, you must save them. either use the corresponding toolbar icon or save the Save in the File menu.</seg>
<seg id="2992">The main window consists of two flashcards, the user and the user group list. for editing, select the desired user or group by double-clicking on the entry.</seg>
<seg id="2993">Some card cards are only displayed when you have advanced system settings. only when you activate space limitations (quota) for users, a card card will be created on which you can set individual settings. other flashcards will appear if shadow passwords, or for example / etc / master.passwd, are installed as in BSD Unixes.</seg>
<seg id="2994">The password management card card appears if shadow passwords or, for example, / etc / master.passwd are installed as in BSD Unixes.</seg>
<seg id="2995">This card card only appears if the space limitation (quota) is enabled and initialized for at least one embedded file system (recognizable by the file quota.user / quota.group on the file system).</seg>
<seg id="2996">These parameters can be set individually for each file system. the current file system is selected with the help of the file system with space limitation.</seg>
<seg id="2997">The index card groups are informed about the group affiliation of the selected user. the default group, to which the user belongs, can be found in the Primary Group field. furthermore, the user can become a member in other groups by selecting them in the large field.</seg>
<seg id="2998">The dialog's Properties dialog contains a list of all users. to add a user to the group, select this user in the list.</seg>
<seg id="2999">To add a user or group, select Add from the User or Group menu or click the appropriate Add button on the toolbar. editing or deleting the selected user or group will work analogously.</seg>
<seg id="3000">With this module, you can install the LILO boot manager, add, remove, and modify the boot password, change the time to the boot of the standard operating system, add the default operating system, remove, change operating systems, remove, modify, and more.</seg>
