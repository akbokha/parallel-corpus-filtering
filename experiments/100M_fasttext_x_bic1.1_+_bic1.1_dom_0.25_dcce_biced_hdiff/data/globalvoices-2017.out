although I had visited the USA at least once a year since 2012 , I would live there for the first time .
and that was very exciting for me .
my love for America is extraordinary .
like many of my generation I grew up with American movies , d@@ anced to American music , read American authors and run his sport .
in fact , this country had such a profound effect on me that I became a journalist mainly because of an American film .
at the age of 14 I saw the great D@@ enz@@ el Washington as he played the Gra@@ y Gran@@ th@@ am in The Peli@@ can L@@ etter , a fear@@ less repor@@ ter who , with the help of Julia Rober@@ ts , covered the mur@@ der@@ ous plot of an oil magn@@ ate who wanted to occupy the Supreme Court with judges who were inclined to occupy his interest .
I was caught .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; free according to Method Man , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; It was as if this is the absolute truth , forget everything else , that &apos;s what I want to do with my life . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and the year I lived in Arizona had only reinforced my admir@@ ation for the USA .
I always said : &quot; America is the only country in which I ever lived , whose diversity is so inviting that you can always be who you are and it is easy to find acceptance in a community of like @-@ minded people .
I even wrote a very sharp letter of love about his great@@ ness .
then came Donald Tr@@ ump .
much has been written about the x@@ en@@ opho@@ bia and rac@@ ism of this man .
the most extraordinary aspect of his ascension is for me how he deals with his narrow @-@ min@@ de@@ dness .
in his opinion he never stops behind the mountain as it is said so beautifully .
he says exactly what he thinks like a former colleague , and openly declares his cont@@ emp@@ t for Muslims , Lat@@ inos , A@@ fr@@ o @-@ American and women .
nevertheless people responded to his statements and voted for him in dro@@ ves .
the 13 million votes he won in the Republi@@ can pre @-@ elections was the highest number that a candidate nominated by the party ever reached .
I was spe@@ ech@@ less .
who are the Americans who support this big@@ ot person , I asked myself ?
I couldn &apos;t reconci@@ le Tr@@ ump and his voters to the people I had met in Phoenix during my time .
for example , my professor , Dr. Bill Sil@@ cock , director of the journ@@ alism program that welcomes people from all over the world , a deep gul@@ li@@ ble person with whom I was able to talk about Islam and his past .
Tr@@ um@@ ps Wel@@ tan@@ schau@@ ung also did not agree with that of Peter Bh@@ ati@@ a , the current editor of the C@@ inc@@ inn@@ ati In@@ qu@@ ir@@ er .
Bh@@ ati@@ a and I met our common love for basketball and we spent many hours watching the &quot; Phoenix S@@ uns &quot; at the game .
Tr@@ um@@ ps intoler@@ ance is also in contrast to the gener@@ osity I experienced at Sand@@ y B@@ ahr , who is fighting the environment for her life , and her husband Dave , my host family who treated me like her son .
she still fits the engagement of Krist@@ i Kapp@@ es , who always helped me with patience and grace and helped my colleagues to get used to the complexity of American life .
then there were Andrew Lec@@ key , Kath@@ ry@@ n Mc@@ Man@@ us and Re@@ tha Hill , my ment@@ ors , whose wise advice helped me a lot in my career .
these people and the values represented by them deep@@ ened my love for America .
while Tr@@ ump ass@@ aul@@ ted his way to the nom@@ inees Republi@@ can presidential candidates , they offered me a stop and the counterpart to his limited vision of America .
it turned out , however , that they were the exception of the rule .
on November 8 , 2016 more than 50 million Americans , mostly white , the presi@@ dency of a man , despite - or perhaps because of his cont@@ emp@@ t against non @-@ white people .
the confrontation with the idea that people voted overwhel@@ m@@ ingly because they either shared their rac@@ ism and fan@@ ati@@ cism , or because they were willing to over@@ look those things , broke my heart almost .
perhaps it is unfair to design@@ ate the tr@@ ump voters as ra@@ cists .
to classi@@ fy people , said one of my friends , is exactly what led us to this situation .
this is superficial and respect@@ ful and implies an inability to understand those who act and think in a different way .
it shows people that their worries and fears don &apos;t take into account the hec@@ tic changes in their communities .
could it be that these voters , most of whom are white , voted for Tr@@ ump because they want to regain control over a country that has disappointed them ?
in other words , they might say they are still important in this America ?
perhaps .
however , one can hardly forget the words of David Rem@@ nick , who comm@@ enting the cruel decision to raise a man who looks down with cont@@ emp@@ t on those who look different than he .
this &quot; Whit@@ el@@ ash &quot; ( note D ) : as much as &quot; le@@ aning the wh@@ ites against all other eth@@ ni@@ cs , &quot; pu@@ n off white in all@@ usion to the wh@@ ites and whi@@ pl@@ ash , which means so much like shot trauma ) , as the great Van Jones called , has killed exactly what America did so magni@@ fic@@ ently .
millions of people around the world appreciate the American ideal - no matter whether myth or reality , it is nevertheless a powerful idea - which faith or background one may always have , America welcomes everyone .
for this country chose as its president , twice the son of a Ken@@ yan , whose history as he himself says , nowhere else in the world would be possible .
with the election of Donald Tr@@ um@@ ps , however , there is a huge part of the White America that promises this promise and says : hell with diversity , religious freedom and the whole concept of pl@@ ur@@ alism .
in America after 9 / 11 the white man is back at the helm , they say .
in all this , I have to think of K@@ hi@@ z@@ r Khan , the father of a soldier who fell in Iraq , and what he said on the eve of the election .
at a demonstration for H@@ illary Clinton , Mr. Khan had a word change with the crowd .
&quot; Donald Tr@@ ump , would my son , Captain Hu@@ may@@ un K@@ ahn , have a place in your America ? &quot; Mr. Khan asked .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the crowd responded with a loud &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; No ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; could Muslims have a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; no ! &quot; the crowd ro@@ ared .
&quot; do Lat@@ inos have a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; no ! &quot; they answered .
do A@@ fr@@ o Americans have a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they cried and their voices were lou@@ der . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; would anyone who is not like you , a place in your America ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he received a unanim@@ ous and loud &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; NO &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mr. Khan concluded with the words : &quot; thank God , Mr. Tr@@ ump , is not your America . &quot; 36 hours later he was rec@@ tified .
the land for which his son was pleased sent him a message .
this is now Tr@@ um@@ ps Land , said the news .
and all the people who look like Mr. Khan , couldn &apos;t find a place in this new America .
and that breaks my heart to me .

what has the Mexican music school of the Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero Community in the Province of O@@ ax@@ aca together with the children of the Paragu@@ a@@ an city of C@@ ate@@ ura together ?
that the music that is played at both places not only changed the life of the children , but also a very close connection with ...
music that lives with the waste
Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero is located on the edge of a large garbage dump , just 16 kilometres south of O@@ ax@@ aca &amp; # 8@@ 212 ; an old colonial city that is very popular among tourists but worlds away from the nearby pre @-@ Colum@@ bian ruins and its world @-@ famous cuisine .
for several years now the La b@@ anda de M@@ Ãº@@ sica ( music band ) has been playing in the community : a symph@@ ony orchestra consisting of children and adults , which has found a way to overcome the surrounding poverty with their musical instruments .
a music school with 100 students has become a central interest for the municipality of Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero in O@@ ax@@ aca .
the British newspaper The Guardian wrote about this project :
the community , located in one of the poor@@ est provinces of Mexico , is known for its drug abuse and the gangs of gangs .
but this changed after a casual encounter with a French pilot who started a musical project and gave the youth a rare hope of hope .
the young band members take their commitments to the music group very seriously , writes the local press Noti@@ ci@@ as O@@ ax@@ aca N@@ VI :
as soon as they come from school they run back home and immediately after lunch they run through the du@@ sty streets to pursue their great passion .
you always come smiling and with shiny eyes and play in the h@@ ust@@ le you learn day for day trumpet , tro@@ mb@@ one , pic@@ col@@ o , clarinet , obo@@ e , flute , forest horn , tim@@ pan@@ i , bon@@ gos and the con@@ ga .
music from tr@@ ash
more than 7@@ ,000 kilometres south of Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero play the children of C@@ ate@@ ura - a village practically located at the top of the largest garbage dump of As@@ unci@@ Ã³n in Paraguay &apos;s capital - on instruments made of recycled waste material :
music with re@@ manufactured instruments , consisting of local solid waste materials , is produced in a workshop for musical instruments in C@@ ate@@ ura , where the recycl@@ ers under the direction of F@@ avi@@ o Ch@@ Ã¡@@ vez have started turning parts of waste into instruments .
instruments im@@ itate viol@@ ins , viol@@ as , cel@@ los , double b@@ asses , guitars , fl@@ utes , sax@@ oph@@ ones , trump@@ ets , tro@@ mb@@ ones and drums all made out of the garbage .
the repertoire includes classical music , folk music , par@@ agu@@ ay@@ an and Latin American music , as well as music of the Beat@@ les , of Frank Sin@@ atra , etc .
in an article in the Los Angeles Times , F@@ avi@@ o Ch@@ Ã¡@@ vez , a local ec@@ ologist and music teacher of the children of C@@ ate@@ ura , rec@@ alls the early days :
at first it was very difficult because we had no place for rehear@@ s@@ als and we had to teach at the same place where parents worked in garbage The children did not know any music and it was very difficult to contact the parents because many of them did not live together with their children .
this changed when F@@ avi@@ o was shown something he had never seen before : a violin @-@ made violin .
today there is a whole orchestra that plays on instruments of re@@ manufactured material and that is called The Recycl@@ ed Orchestra .
a documentation called &quot; Land@@ fill Harmon@@ ic &quot; ( Harmon@@ ic garbage dump ) records the musical performance :
every year , the world generates about one billion tons of waste .
those who live with him and of him are the poor@@ est - like the people in C@@ ate@@ ura , Paraguay .
and here they turn him into something beautiful .
Land@@ fill Harmon@@ ic follows the orchestra with its inspiring spectacle of tr@@ ash @-@ to @-@ music around the world .
the orchestra even played his music in front of Pope Francis :
these East African countries show how technology and team work can successfully fight illegal fishing
photo Â© F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i Africa - a project that fights wild illegal fishing .
this entry , written by Emma Br@@ yce , was originally published at En@@ si@@ a.com , a magazine that reports specifically about international , practical solutions for environmental problems .
the re @-@ release will be published as part of an agreement with Global Vo@@ ices for sharing content together .
in West Africa , it was known at that time that this ship had already had illegal fishing in the land of Liberia before it searched the other coast of Africa .
the East African countries were accordingly upset and little inclined to welcome a law break@@ er of this kind on their coasts .
in Kenya , Tanzania , Mauritius , the Com@@ or@@ os , Moz@@ ambique and the Seych@@ elles , they quickly mobili@@ zed against the ship . they refused to ship one of their ports and refused to give him a fishing permit .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; suddenly the prime minister was surrounded by countries that simply refused everything , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bene@@ dict Ki@@ il@@ u , a senior employee of the Ken@@ yan fishing authority , is part of a team that discovered and persecuted the ship at that time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 2013 , the ship was then driven out of the waters of the region : he was not able to catch fish there .
in the end , it was also obliged to pay 2 million US dollars to Liberia , because of pil@@ lage of the fish stocks of the country .
the core of this initiative , which crosses criminal practices and protects resources , was F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i Africa : a network of countries , founded in 2012 by the N@@ RO Stop Il@@ legal Fishing ( illegal fishing ) .
the members of this network are in addition to Somalia and Madagascar the six countries that had expelled the Premier from their waters at that time .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have eight countries that are like @-@ minded and work together . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Tony Long , head of the P@@ ew Char@@ itable Trust Project En@@ ding Il@@ legal Fishing . this project provides technical support for F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
illegal fishing is un@@ regulated by definition : what is caught is hidden , therefore it is extremely difficult to track down . this makes illegal fishing a major cause of over@@ fishing in regions .
by the inten@@ tional dis@@ regard of existing laws , by which certain habitats and species are to be protected , illegal fishing ecos@@ ystems can damage ecos@@ ystems that have a delicate balance .
but while actions against illegal fishing had once been ham@@ pered by bureaucratic hur@@ d@@ les and also by the sn@@ ail speed , with the information between individual countries circulating , actions happen nowadays in real time , with trac@@ eable to F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i &apos;s digital communication platform .
there , for example , the individual countries can exchange lists of existing licenses , news on suspi@@ cious activities or details that were noticed or experienced during a port inspection .
fish @-@ i also draws attention to the activities of ships when they move around the open sea using satellite data .
this makes it possible for the authorities to identify ships that fish in prohibited areas , such as those that suggest that a ship will load its caught fish on the road to other ships .
ideally , such studies show whether the ships involved have a fishing license , where they were on the way and possibly whether they have a criminal record .
countries that are against illegal fishing can then refuse to accept such information in their ports on the basis of this information . which means that the ships cannot sell their cargo , and that they can even be forced to pay pen@@ alties , as in the case of the prime minister .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s about substantial financial losses for the owner , which means that illegal fishing is not worthwhile financially . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and that &apos;s what we want to achieve , &quot; says P@@ er Erik Ber@@ gh , senior director of N@@ F@@ DS Africa . the latter is a consulting firm that advoc@@ ates the fight against illegal fishing in Africa and also supports F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i .
a closed front
the already mentioned platform was created to gain an estimated $ 20 million lost in revenue lost by the eight members of the H@@ IS@@ H @-@ i network each year because of illegal fishermen who enter East African waters .
East Africa has one of the most productive tuna fisheries , which attracts the region &apos;s commercial fishing from all over the world .
their practices include activities such as sailing under false flag , fake license papers , specification of f@@ antasi@@ es , fishing protected species and fishing in nature reserves .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they deliberately exploit the lack of international co @-@ operation and exploit the weaknesses of a completely organised control system , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Long . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but another country could say &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Come to me &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and this legal hiding place attempts to close F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
until now , the closed front is working .
since its foundation , F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i has been involved in more than 30 studies of suspi@@ cious ships .
it has uncovered criminal networks that had distributed fake licenses in Tanzania . it discovered ships that used several frau@@ dul@@ ent identi@@ ties and it has pursued and found escap@@ ing ships .
due to his cooperation with INTER@@ PO@@ L , the international authority to combat crime , F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i can share and maintain information on illegal fishing over large distances .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some of our investigations lead us quite far into the networks of organized crime , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Ber@@ gh . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it builds a system that will help F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i to locate suspi@@ cious ships more precisely .
photo courtesy of F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i Africa .
fish @-@ i &apos;s satellite system , which is constantly being developed , also helps to detect the illegal vessels that would like to hide .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; illegal fishermen use very sophisticated techniques to hide their activities and their position . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we try to cross this , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Dun@@ can Cop@@ eland , chief analy@@ st at Tr@@ y@@ gg M@@ at Tracking , an NGO that also deals with fisheries data and offers F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i technical support . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
some of the ships , for example , switch off their automatic identification systems with which they can no longer be ordered by satellites .
Cop@@ eland therefore helps build a system that connects different levels of information . it is intended to help F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i find criminal ships with greater precision .
a model program
but can F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i &apos;s team of African nations really influence the un@@ question@@ ably global problem of illegal fishing ?
John A@@ mos , President of N@@ RO Sky@@ Truth , believes this .
recently , Sky@@ Truth has opened the Global Fishing Watch platform together with Google and the Oce@@ ana Marine Protection Organisation : a platform that provides satellite data and can be displayed anywhere in the world by means of the ship &apos;s position .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; getting together with the neighbours to get a better picture of who is doing - that simply makes sense , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we should do this on a global scale . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; P@@ ew Char@@ itable Tru@@ sts has a similar project to run in which a global system allows tracking ships . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are signs that F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i &apos;s activities are not only det@@ ecting criminals but also deter@@ red them .
ships that used to be conf@@ is@@ cated without a license and had little to reck@@ on with consequences now know they are being watched .
according to Ki@@ il@@ u , some of the countries involved in F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i have meanwhile recorded a 33 % increase in fisher@@ y sales since fishing boats are purchasing more licenses .
after F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i Somalia had helped det@@ ecting Gre@@ ko 1 , the inspec@@ tors found on board tow@@ ing networks , whose use is forbidden .
photo courtesy of F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i Africa .
other countries also see these successes . &quot; the effect is so strong that we now also copy other countries , &quot; says Ki@@ il@@ u . &quot; we have become a study object . &quot; in West Africa , several hundred million dollars are lost annually by illegal fishing .
there are six countries joined in 2015 , the so @-@ called West Africa Task Force . they are also fighting illegal fishing , according to exactly the same model as F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i@@ . &quot; &quot; With security , the aim is to create even more such initiatives and structures in other regions , &quot; says Cop@@ eland .
recently , F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i &apos;s youngest member state Somalia has been able to announce his first major triumph : in October , it was Gre@@ ko 1 , a ship that was on the road under false flag . and not only was the ship on the road without a licence and were used by tow@@ ing nets which are now banned .
the ship was also inv@@ aded in forbidden waters reserved for fishermen from Somalia . &quot; &quot; with the take of measures against Gre@@ ko 1 , they set a strong sign that they would go against illegal fishing , &quot; says Ber@@ gh .
for F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i , this is another success of many . and at the same time the proof that such a special collaborative way of working to protect the oceans actually works across the oceans . Emma Br@@ yce is a freelance journalist and lives in London .
her articles appear in Wi@@ red Magazine , TED Education , the New York Times and the Guardian . situation in Venezuela is escal@@ ating further : demonstrations in several cities with the aim of &quot; rec@@ ap@@ turing the country &quot;
the street movements in Venezuela seem to be only the beginning of a wave of violent demonstrations .
they are considered to be a protest against the government &apos;s decision to stop the referendum on the presidential election of President Nicol@@ Ã¡s Mad@@ uro .

after the government of Venezuela rejected the application of the opposition to a referendum on the det@@ achment , the Venezu@@ el@@ ans responded in whose eyes the negotiations on the political and economic crisis of the country ran into the void by gathering together on the streets .
under the h@@ ash@@ tag # La@@ Tom@@ a@@ De@@ Venezuela ( for example : the reimbur@@ sement of Venezuela ) can be found in both demonstrations and arguments for and against it .
the debate is also being conducted in other parts of the country - including in the Bar@@ inas area , in the An@@ des regions MÃ©@@ ri@@ da and T@@ Ã¡@@ chir@@ a , in the central North of the federal state of Car@@ ab@@ ob@@ o and on the Isla Margar@@ ita in the state of Nu@@ eva E@@ spart@@ a .
the political and economic situation of the country continues to deterior@@ ate , which is reflected in the daily life of the Venezu@@ el@@ ans through an acute lack of food and medicines .
many representatives of the opposition saw the possibility of a fundamental change in the inauguration of the current President Nicol@@ Ã¡s Mad@@ uro , but in the end the reluc@@ tance of a re @-@ election was blocked by the official authorities .
Mari@@ anne D@@ Ã­@@ az , acting at Global Vo@@ ices in Venezuela , sum@@ mar@@ ises in her latest article the context of the government decision as follows :
in the context of the social , political and economic crisis , where inflation and violence are among the highest in the world ( the inflation rate is estimated at 500 % for the annual financial statements ) and in which a serious and far @-@ reaching lack of food and medicine , the referendum was considered the only way to give the country a chance to regain its institutional structures and to close a new government alliance .
the electoral alliance of Mes@@ a de la Uni@@ dad Democr@@ Ã¡@@ tica or shortly MU@@ D ( for example : round table of the Democratic Union ) , in which the opposition parties and political groups merged . in addition , a twelve @-@ hour strike on the torture day and a march to the Mira@@ fl@@ ores Palace , the Venezu@@ el@@ an government seat , was planned on 3 November , should continue to block the referendum on the det@@ achment .
the appeal was commented on Twitter , among other things , as follows :
it is as long as Venezuela : tomorrow National Assembly , Friday nationwide civil war and on 3 November all to Car@@ ac@@ as to the Mira@@ fl@@ ores Palace .

the first demonstration in the context of the action programme &quot; The re@@ conquest of Venezuela &quot; took place on Wednesday , 26 October .
the images of the mar@@ ches published in real time testify among other things an overwhelming participation of the people in numerous areas of the country , but also confron@@ tations with polic@@ emen and supporters of the government .
one of the most widely shared pictures shows a demonstr@@ ator calling through the shiel@@ ds : &quot; will you kill me , because I am hungry ? &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; will you kill me , because I am hungry ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

on Twitter , there are pictures that talk about confron@@ tations as well as reports of oppression and abuse .
especially big waves struck the news about police repression in the centrally located town of Mar@@ ac@@ ay .
there the demonstr@@ ators moved back to the local Cathedral to protect themselves from the police and armed advoc@@ ates of the government according to their own testimony .
hours later they could safely leave the cathedral , but the protests continued .
in other parts of the country , some demonstr@@ ators tried to stop the police , including this woman in the An@@ de@@ an State T@@ Ã¡@@ chir@@ a :
the women in T@@ Ã¡@@ chir@@ a do not carry any skir@@ ts , because otherwise you could see something that many National Gu@@ ards do not have !
meanwhile an info@@ graphic makes the round that forms the scale of oppression per day :
thus the dictatorship has supp@@ ressed the country .
many representatives of the government had questioned the validity of the demand for a presidential procedure - this has now been proved in the eyes of many by the presence of countless people on the streets .
My@@ t@@ ek Media Lab@@ s for this :

here is your release !
on the road !
others are evaluating these protests as a further step in the fight against a government that has taken little against the devastating economic crisis and has preferred to keep critical voices silent :
they took us so much - but also fear !
the mar@@ ches are growing more and more in frequency and intensity .
some Venezu@@ el@@ ans reported to the media that they were too hungry to participate in a strike instead of working or shopping .

the interview was translated into English and is published here with kind permission .
when he was 15 years old , Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano was forced by his father to take a look at the atro@@ cities in La Per@@ la , a secret prison in the Argent@@ ine city of Cordoba .
as an adult man , Qui@@ j@@ ano now spoke against his father as part of the Grand La Per@@ la Ri@@ bera Process in the province of Cordoba .
in the trial which ended on 24 August 2016 , crimes committed during the Argent@@ ine@@ an military dictatorship were investigated .
Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano did not choose his life .
beginning with the burden of wearing the same name as his father , up to the brutal military operations in the prison La Per@@ la , which he observed at the age of 15 , he suffered enough .
for 34 years he kept family secrets for himself .
in the situation back then I thought that was right .
I felt like a secret agent .
as a child with 15 years , one does not notice that one is manipul@@ ated by his father .
at that time I could not see that my father was a th@@ ief , tor@@ turer and mur@@ derer .
Luis had no choice : his father Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano was a gendar@@ mer@@ ist . during the Argent@@ ine@@ an military dictatorship from 1974 to 1983 , a time of state terrorism , his father was the Deputy Commander of the Intelligence Department 141 in the La Per@@ la prison .

this is not the story of Luis Qui@@ j@@ ano , the oppres@@ sor who is accused of ab@@ duction in 158 cases , torture , murder in almost 100 cases and the kidn@@ apping of a 10 @-@ year @-@ old child .
no , this is the story of Luis Qui@@ x@@ y@@ an@@ os son , a man who , over the years , recognized the extent of atro@@ cities he had experienced as a boy , and who testified before a federal court against his own father .
his story shows what great power a parent has over his child and how this child chose a path of salvation for himself .
from the sports hall to the military base
when my father started to take me to the military base , I often went to the sports hall with us .
they all called him &quot; K@@ ent . &quot;
I told my father about him and a few days later he showed me a black and white photo and asked me to identify my friend .
he said :
you are an as@@ sh@@ ole , you have been friends with an ERP .
just be careful not to kidn@@ ap you one day and I must save you .
the abbrevi@@ ation ERP is for Ej@@ Ã©r@@ c@@ ito Revol@@ u@@ ci@@ on@@ ario del Pu@@ eb@@ lo , the Military People &apos;s Army - the Military Arm of the Revolutionary Workers &apos; Party of Argentina .
therefore he for@@ ba@@ de me to go back to the sports hall again . a few days later he took me to work on the military base .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he told me I would become a secret agent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I was 15 years old and in the situation I thought that would be fine .
at the base of the military , I had to destroy papers that had heard the prisoner .
these were all possible documents : university degrees , hand@@ written notes , literature , certificates , propaganda materials , books , just everything .

&apos;@@ there the prisoners are tor@@ tured &apos;
my father took me four times to La Per@@ la , all in 1976 .
at the first and last time he let me wait at the entrance in the car .
when he took me the second time , he ordered me to go out . he led me to a barracks , in the cars , furniture , TV , fri@@ dges - just anything possible - stood .
all of it was stolen .
he gave me a small package wrapped in a blanket and ordered me to carry it to the car . when I opened it , I saw that there was a great cl@@ ump of silver .
on that day I went to the other end of the barracks , where the stolen items were par@@ ked and kept me with a guard .
suddenly he pointed to an open space and said :
there the prisoners are tor@@ tured .
I se@@ wed in and saw a lying on which people were tor@@ tured .
it looked like a field bed and metal springs .
later I found out that they fixed the one end of a cable . the other end was attached to the body of the person who was just tied up there .
she rarely caught a man with hand@@ cu@@ ffs on the bed , poured it out with water and ch@@ ased him a load of 220 vol@@ ts into the gen@@ itals .

the sten@@ ch there was terrible ... like a dirty win@@ ch .
years later , when my father was under house arrest , the same smell came from his room .
I recognized the smell immediately and it became clear to me that this is the smell of a body in need .
I could never forget this smell .
and I asked myself : how is it possible that one person can do so much suffering to another ?
&apos;@@ i knew these people were killed &apos;
when my father took me to work for the third time , he led me to the entrance of La Cu@@ ad@@ ra - the area where the prisoners were tied with hand@@ cu@@ ffs and became eye @-@ binding .
he talked with &quot; Ch@@ ub@@ i &quot; Lop@@ ez ( Jose L@@ Ã³@@ pez , a civilian who was also accused of trial ) and I took the opportunity to take a look at La Cu@@ ad@@ ra .
in the background , I saw a number of matt@@ resses on which naked people were lying down with the face - all were tied to hands and feet .
in the vicinity of the entrance ch@@ ewed people still rested on the matt@@ resses .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when my father saw that I saw the prisoners , he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; What do you look like , as@@ sh@@ ole ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I replied &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Why did you otherwise bring me ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I knew these people were killed .
they were thrown into a pit and killed and buried by soldiers .
I know this because my father told me about it .
in addition to La Cu@@ ad@@ ra , some rooms were designated as offices .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I know that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pal@@ ito &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Rom@@ ero put together a man there and killed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
( according to testim@@ onies of survivors of the civil war Jor@@ ge Rom@@ ero , who was also accused of the La Per@@ la Ri@@ bera Process , was accused of death by the students Ra@@ Ãº@@ l Mat@@ eo Mol@@ ina ) .
in the following video Emi@@ lio Fes@@ sia , the director of the La Per@@ la Memorial , leads through the former torture chambers .
the way you came in here is also the way on which the kidn@@ apped came here .
if you look at the map , you see that they took about this path and then were tor@@ tured for the first time .
here their names were changed and they were assigned a number as part of the process of de@@ human@@ ization .
when they survived torture , the prisoners were thrown into the cu@@ ad@@ ra until the order from above was supposed to be reloc@@ ated .
this was the lie - the eu@@ ph@@ em@@ ism - for the shooting of the people and the disappearance of their corp@@ ses in most cases .
the &apos; spo@@ ils of war &apos;
my father brought home all sorts of stolen stuff .
at that time I had no idea what the &quot; spo@@ ils of war &quot; - as they called it - was .
but when I was in the military later , I was in the gendar@@ mer@@ ie - it became clear to me that the boot@@ y is a bay@@ on@@ et or perhaps military marks , which one takes away from an enemy that one has fought .
Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano with his son .

but if one goes into a house and ste@@ als the refrigerator , the record player , clothes , paintings , money ... then this is not a boot@@ y but v@@ and@@ alism .
this is theft .
I have always wondered how my father , the manager of the security forces , could take part in this v@@ and@@ alism .
I just don &apos;t understand it .
I was also an officer in the gendar@@ mer@@ ie and I would never have liked to enter a house and steal everything in it .
I don &apos;t understand how my father could do that .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; once he called me a criminal and I replied : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and you who steal cars on the streets ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
you are not a criminal ?
he explo@@ ded rage , struck me and cried :
if you go so far , then I will find you and embrace you .
we don &apos;t need anyone else to do that !
so my father was .
I have no good memory of him .
when I said in the process , I showed a photo of then , on which I wore a jacket and a roll collar swe@@ ater from wool . both had my father from La Per@@ la .
we were not poor , but he still brought clothes to home .
at that time the defence accused me of being a con@@ spir@@ ator in this crime . I replied , no problem , they can lay down to me what they wanted .
I was there anyway to cancel .
&apos;@@ the disappearance of the corp@@ se is the last ab@@ hor@@ rent act &apos;
now , where I am older , I feel re@@ mor@@ se .
I have children . once you have children , you recognize the value of a life .
one develops further and real@@ ises that it is false to kill .
I even went so far to say :
well , you have executed people during the dictatorship , but what is the purpose of the corp@@ ses to disappear ?
why do children kidn@@ ap ?
one day my father brought a girl with her mother , whose mother had been killed .
she was like our pet , almost like a dog - only that this was a little girl .
I repeatedly asked myself : they were tor@@ tured , but why were they killed ?
it would have been easy to put them into prison .
I guess it was simply decided to kill these people , but why did their bodies disappear ?
didn &apos;t these people also have families that could be handed over to their mortal remains ?
the disappearance of the corp@@ se is the last abom@@ in@@ able act that one can do to a human being .
my father told me when the democracy was re@@ introduced , they brought machines to remove the mortal remains of the prisoners .
they were crushed and dispos@@ ed of somewhere - no idea where . &quot; you will never find anything , &quot; said my father .
but of course there is always something .
&apos;@@ i have seen how you killed people ! &apos;
only to clarify it : I have nothing against the military .
I was even with the gendar@@ mer@@ ie .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I just said the truth about 20 criminals - including my father . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the thought of showing my father arose during a conversation when he was under house arrest .
I made him repro@@ aches because of all the atro@@ cities I had to experience because of him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; then he suddenly said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know . I have killed anyone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I felt in@@ war@@ dly rejected and asked me why all the exagger@@ ated patri@@ ot@@ ism and the &quot; Western and Christian sentim@@ ents &quot; allegedly defending it were actually good .
then I cried :
how can you tell me something ?
I have seen how you killed people !
you have committed terrible crimes and you forced me as a child to participate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he replied &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Well , then show me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
that &apos;s exactly what I did .
in 2010 , I made the first display .
I finally realized that he was a criminal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no one can reproach me that I was pre@@ occupied . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I finally testified against my own father . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano died in May 2015 under house arrest pending before the end of the trial . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he was charged with 4@@ 16 crimes , including serious , illegal de@@ priv@@ ation of liberty in 158 cases , torture in 15@@ 4 cases , murder in 98 particularly severe cases , torture followed by death in five cases and a case of kidn@@ apping of a child under 10 years of age .

the judgments in the &quot; Meg@@ ac@@ aus@@ a &quot;
the term &quot; Meg@@ ac@@ aus@@ a &quot; refers to the magnitude of the judgment in Spanish .
after four years , in which more than 5@@ 81 witnesses were heard , the historic La Per@@ la Ri@@ bera Process ended due to the crimes committed between March 1975 and December 1978 against 7@@ 16 victims eventually in August .
43 oppres@@ sors were found guilty of crimes against humanity . in 28 cases , the Court had sentenced to life imprisonment and in nine cases of imprisonment between 2 and 14 years . in six cases , there were acqu@@ itt@@ ances .
eleven of the 54 defend@@ ants died during the trial .
# La@@ Per@@ la@@ verdict : murder , torture and rape by officials .
all the accused were members of the military during the dictatorship , including former military personnel , former police officers and civilian personnel .
Pier@@ o De Mon@@ ti was kidn@@ apped with his pregnant wife in June 1976 and brought to La Per@@ la .
he addressed the following words to the silence chamber :
La Per@@ la was a death factory designed by in@@ human heads .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Court judgment is a historic landmark for all human rights organisations who have worked for years for justice for the victims . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Claudio O@@ ros@@ z , the lawyer of the Argent@@ inian organization founded in 1995 by H.@@ I.@@ J. O.@@ S. , who represents the children of people who were murdered or disappeared during the dictatorship , said :
the process took more than three years , but the research for it took 39 years .
in March 2007 , the Argent@@ ine@@ an government sur@@ rendered the country on which La Per@@ la was located so that a memorial could be built there , which is now led by human rights organisations .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a translation error makes older people in Kyoto a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; aw@@ ful mot@@ orists &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the sign with the translation error in a centre in Kyoto , in which one can extend its driving licence .
the photo was dissemin@@ ated in the social media .
edited the original photos by Joshua Lev@@ ine .
in the Japanese city of Kyoto , customers of a newly opened centre in which one can extend his driving license , witnessed a particularly mis@@ successful translation last month .
on a plate , the Japanese word was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; older drivers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; wrong@@ ly - possibly also with bad rear thoughts and # 8@@ 212 ; translated as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; terrible drivers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the wrong translation was to be read on electronic ads in the entrance area and in the building from 1 to 20 September .
edited the original photos by Joshua Lev@@ ine , which was widely shared in the social media .
the mistake was noticed by the translator Julian Hol@@ mes , a resident of Ky@@ ot@@ os . he was also who made the local papers aware of it .
the post @-@ Kyoto daily Kyoto S@@ him@@ bu@@ n wrote :
&quot; how could it come to such an English translation ?
this proves that no one has read the translation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is an insul@@ t to older people and in an international city like Kyoto is simply unacceptable , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hol@@ mes said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the correct English translation was first removed . the term &quot; terrible drivers &quot; ( German : &quot; terrible drivers &quot; ) was later replaced by the more appropriate , although gram@@ mati@@ cally not quite correct designation &quot; elder drivers &quot; ( German : &quot; older drivers &quot; ) .
the Kyoto Police Department ap@@ ologi@@ zed for the translation error . furthermore , she explained that the mistake had already been contained in the text they had received from the translator and that the translation was not checked for correctness before it was published .
a blo@@ gger told the following about the ap@@ ology :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are really sorry that older people felt offen@@ ded by the insufficient correction ( translation ) on our part , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the police . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Japanese online news service J @-@ C@@ ast News deals with the phenomenon of &quot; terrible &quot; older drivers in Japan apart and wrote :
the word &quot; aw@@ ful &quot; was den@@ ounced as an in@@ appropriate description of older drivers . according to the police , the proportion of elderly drivers who are involved in accidents all over the country is a matter of concern .
in the Kyoto Pre@@ f@@ ecture , for example , 1,@@ 9@@ 41 of 19,@@ 4@@ 60 accidents were caused by sen@@ iors in 2005 , representing a proportion of 10 % .
ten years later , in 2014 , senior citizens created 1,@@ 80@@ 3 of 11,@@ 850 accidents .
this increased its share to 17.@@ 7 % .
while the number of accidents decreased overall , the proportion of accidents caused by sen@@ iors increased during the same period .
the un@@ named Repor@@ ter brought comments on the light in the article published on Yahoo , showing what prejudi@@ ces some Japanese apparently he@@ ap against older drivers :
the article on Yahoo via the translation error has among other things received the following comments :
- &quot; Is this ( &quot; dre@@ ad@@ ful mot@@ orists &quot; ) perhaps not the reality ? &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; So flaw@@ ed is the translation really not , isn &apos;t it ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t think it &apos;s a real translation error . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are not a few such comments .
why &quot; En@@ gr@@ ish &quot; is so common throughout Asia
translation errors are widespread in Japan and throughout Asia .
the En@@ gr@@ ish@@ .com website is a true treasure tro@@ ve for these bizarre mistakes in English .

the reasons for the wide spread of translation errors are manifold .
for transl@@ ating , you need two important skills : passive language skills to understand the original text and to translate active language skills to translate it into the target language .
the latter requires the active control of the target language - something that is the case with native speakers . generally , the conviction that translators should be in the target language - not in the original language - should be native speakers .
for example , a French native speaker should translate from English into French - not from French to English .
photo by Fli@@ ck@@ r user Karl Baron .
many Japanese companies do not employ people with English as their mother tongue , who could make translations into English . this may be due to lack of understanding for transl@@ ating , cost reasons or the relatively small number of English native speakers who learn Japanese .
some companies , who do not have foreign employees themselves , can still make translations in @-@ house . then the Japanese co @-@ worker , whose English knowledge is the best , is made to the translator - no matter how good or bad his language skills are really .
photo by Fli@@ ck@@ r user Karl Baron .
mechanical translations are also widely used - often with funny results .
the verb@@ ati@@ m sentences , which arise through machine translation , show that this technique does not replace a human translator for a long time . this is especially true for some languages .
some of the stran@@ gest English form@@ ulations in Japan , including the en@@ ig@@ matic prints that often decorate t @-@ shirts or bags , are used for styl@@ istic reasons - not to be read or even understood .
photo by Fli@@ ck@@ r user Joseph Br@@ ent .
translation errors may be acceptable or at least harmless as jewellery . however , by large companies or from the government who have the means to ensure higher standards , it is possible to expect more accurate translations .
in the future , the city of Kyoto will hopefully use a more serious source for its translations .
Venezuela : protest and cens@@ orship measures on the internet and television
main page of the portal &quot; Nav@@ egar con Liber@@ ta@@ d &quot; ( Free Sur@@ fing ) of IP@@ Y@@ S ( Institu@@ to Pr@@ ens@@ a y Soci@@ e@@ dad , Institute for Press and Society ) .
on Friday morning , 7 April , Venezu@@ el@@ an Internet users reported that they would not have access to the Vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay online channel .
later , other users wrote that the internet appearances of V@@ PI@@ TV and El Cap@@ it@@ oli@@ o TV were no longer available .
other online broad@@ cast@@ ers also recorded recordings of the protests in Car@@ ac@@ as organized by opposition groups who opposed the government of Nicol@@ Ã¡s Ma@@ du@@ ros .
the protests began at the beginning of April , after the Supreme Court dissolved the parliament and transferred the Parliament &apos;s duties to the executive and the Supreme Court itself .
Luis Carlos D@@ Ã­@@ az , journalist and author at Global Vo@@ ices , published the results of a tra@@ cer@@ ou@@ tes . he pointed out that the connection was t@@ apped , and advised the users to use VPN ( virtual private networks ) to get access to the Internet .
# Zen@@ sur : activ@@ ates your VPN .
it seems that the Internet pages of Venezu@@ el@@ an providers have been closed again .
this is from the @ Vi@@ vo@@ Play@@ Net site .
offers such as Vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay are popular among Venezu@@ el@@ ans with Internet access , especially in times of un@@ rest .
traditional media have been hes@@ it@@ ant since 2014 when reporting on protests . at that time , the Commission threatened to punish them with fin@@ es and closures if they continued to report on the demonstrations , as the Commission saw this as a &quot; call to violence . &quot;
without cable TV and inform@@ ational national TV channels , I registered at @ vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay@@ net again .
amazing that it is still cheaper to buy two litres of lem@@ on@@ ade .
the local NGO VE@@ sin@@ fil@@ tro later confirmed that not only Vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay was in@@ accessible by blocking the Domain Name System ( DNS ) , but also two other online channels . this also concerns the website where the National Assembly transfers its sessions .
previous research at the Institute for Press and Society ( IP@@ Y@@ S ) , a research group for digital rights in Venezuela , had revealed that local internet providers sometimes use DNS . this is a technique by which the DNS servers respond to requests of certain domains flaw@@ lessly .
if a web site is blocked by the DNS , the server will respond er@@ ron@@ e@@ ously or deny the request when calling such a website .
we confirm a DNS lock : @ el@@ capit@@ oli@@ ot@@ v , @ V@@ PI@@ TV and @ vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay@@ net
at V@@ PI@@ TV , a third blocked channel , the transmission was set on Thursday , April 6 , when the V@@ PI@@ TV camera man El@@ vis Flor@@ es , who carried the protests in Car@@ ac@@ as live , was arrested .
Flor@@ es was beaten while he was in police custody .
eight hours later he was released , and V@@ PI@@ TV went on stream again .
although some channels are still accessible via YouTube , it has also been reported that the government regul@@ ates internet connections : this makes the Venezu@@ el@@ an access to multimedia coverage more and more difficult .
in Paraguay , many girls become slaves to receive education
T@@ ina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was a teen@@ ager as a child . now she visits the house where she worked for years .
today T@@ ina struggles for the rights of children and collects testim@@ onies of other Cri@@ adi@@ ans who have been victims of abuse and discrimination .
photo by Ceci@@ lia Ro@@ jas . use with kind permission of structural .
the following article is the shortened version of a structural , published by Global Vo@@ ices with kind permission of the authors .
the article is part of a series entitled &quot; Vac@@ as que v@@ u@@ el@@ an , Esc@@ u@@ el@@ as que Ca@@ en &quot; ( &quot; Flying cows , falling schools &quot; ) , edited and re@@ published by Global Vo@@ ices of Latin America .
T@@ ina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a lived for eight years in a household where she was not allowed to eat together with the family living there .
shortly before her gradu@@ ation at the university she returned to the house and heard the owner of the house full of pride about her . &quot; she is like a daughter for us .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but T@@ ina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was never treated like a daughter in this house .
when she was ten years old , she began to work as a cri@@ adi@@ ta for the family . as Cri@@ adi@@ tas , the more than 46@@ ,000 boys and girls who are forced to work to go to school are called Cri@@ adi@@ ta .
the business is quite simple : a big family with little money transfers their under@@ age son or their under@@ age daughter to another , more abundant family . in exchange , the child receives food , a training and a roof over his head .
what is not mentioned , however , is that the children will have to perform countless days of house@@ work that will never be paid and victims of abuse and abuse - and all that within the framework of a contract that one cannot lift up .
this practice referred to as Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go is widespread in Paraguay because of its participation and acceptance by large parts of society and despite numerous complaints by human rights organisations .
after gradu@@ ating , Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a worked for a few years for an organization that fights for the rights of boys and girls .
she spoke with Cri@@ adi@@ tas - especially young girls are affected by the practice of cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go - collected testim@@ onies , resear@@ ched and den@@ ounced .
she tried to name things by name , because the feeling of gratitude , which is ino@@ cul@@ ated by the Cri@@ adi@@ ta , generally guarantees silence .
&quot; the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go is based on a double dec@@ eption , &quot; says Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a .
on the one hand , the family , whose daughter is in the belief that she will complete her training , improve her position in society and &quot; make something out of herself &quot; can be transferred to another family .
on the other hand , the family , who assimil@@ ates the girl with him and justi@@ fies its exploitation with the faith , is that they give someone a chance that would otherwise have no education and might even be star@@ ved .
the victims of the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go
when the girl is ab@@ used , his family will learn about it many years later .
sometimes they never experience it .
in January 2016 the previously unknown phenomenon , which takes place in the hidden in par@@ agu@@ ay@@ an households , got a face .
when Carolina Mar@@ Ã­n came to hospital in Ca@@ agu@@ az@@ Ãº , her body showed signs of violent blows . shortly afterwards she died .
she was 14 years old .
she was Cri@@ adi@@ ta in the household of the former military citizen Tom@@ Ã¡s F@@ errei@@ ra and his wife Ram@@ ona Mel@@ gar@@ ej@@ o , who works as a civil servant at the Population Register .
Mar@@ Ã­n was living with them in their house in V@@ aqu@@ er@@ Ã­a , a small village with only 3,000 inhabitants located 250 kilometers east of the capital As@@ unci@@ Ã³n .
at the end of January 2016 , F@@ errei@@ ra took on a stick on Mar@@ Ã­n as long as she suffered le@@ thal injuries .
this should be the last punishment in the life of the young girl .
a few days later , the media reported on the incident .
they stressed that the murdered child was a cri@@ adi@@ ta .
organizations such as UN@@ IC@@ EF or Call@@ es@@ cu@@ ela made the practice of cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go deep in the Paragu@@ ay@@ an society responsible for the death of the girl .
they designated the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go as &quot; a modern form of slavery . &quot;
several dozen people came to protest meetings and demanded that there be no further Carolina in Paraguay .
the girl &apos;s name and photos were widespread in social media .
&quot; in Paraguay , more cows are registered as children , &quot; compl@@ ained T@@ ina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a .
without documents it is much easier to violate the rights of children without imp@@ unity .
without official documents it is very difficult to control under what conditions boys and girls live .
the neighbours of the married couple and almost 60 civil society organisations called for a swift investigation of the case .
they want Tom@@ Ã¡s F@@ errei@@ ra and Ram@@ ona Mel@@ gar@@ ej@@ o to be sentenced to 30 years in prison for the murder of the girl who was her Cri@@ adi@@ ta .
if the case occurs in court , the case of Carolina Mar@@ Ã­n could be fur@@ ious - if for the first time in the history of Paraguay a case of Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go comes before court .
the everyday life of a Cri@@ adi@@ ta
the Cri@@ adi@@ tas are exploited not only as labor , they also live isolated from other girls at their age .
T@@ ina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was ten years old when the Far@@ bi@@ k , where her father worked , had to sign up bankrupt@@ cy and her father lost his job .
their brothers had to go all the way and began selling sweets on the street or on the market to earn money .
but they all went to school .
only T@@ ina was sent as Cri@@ adi@@ ta to the capital As@@ unci@@ Ã³n .
in the house of her employers , Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a worked between four and six hours every day .
she had to divide the time in such a way that she was still time to learn .
she rose up every morning at five o &apos;clock and prepared breakfast for her employers .
on Friday , for example , they cleaned the fridge , cleaned the living room , polished the furniture and dis@@ infected the floor .
when the school was finished , she went home again and had time to learn .
the sooner she was finished with learning , the more free time she had .
but even this time was limited because she had to make dinner for her employers .
Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a says she never had to star@@ ve , but she didn &apos;t get unlimited food . &quot; I was allowed to get more books from the master &apos;s library as food from the fridge , &quot; she re@@ members .
the library was well equipped and belonged to the landlord , a former military and sympath@@ iz@@ ers of the parti@@ do Liber@@ al , a liberal party that belonged to the opposition during the dictatorship of Al@@ fre@@ do Stro@@ ess@@ ner , who was in power from 1954 to 1989 .
on some evenings , the landlord Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a forced him to stand next to him and read editorial from the opposition newspapers such as &quot; Sen@@ der@@ o &quot; or &quot; El Pu@@ eb@@ lo . &quot;
he tried to persu@@ ade them to not believe the reports of the official media about the dict@@ ator regime .
he thought she was intelligent , but didn &apos;t stay with her . &quot; the host found someone who listened while he talked about politics , &quot; she says .
&quot; they didn &apos;t often allow me to visit my family because they thought that I would get &quot; bad habits &quot; there again . &quot; they said that Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a , which belongs to the indigenous group of the Guar@@ ani , would return home to Guar@@ ani &apos;s native language again at home .
their masters were afraid that they would lose the education they had made possible , they explain .
but she was fully aware that she had paid for everything she got from them with their hard work .
also at school , Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was discrimin@@ ated against . &quot; one thing that is almost never talked about is mo@@ b@@ bing and the har@@ ass@@ ment that cri@@ adi@@ tas are exposed when they go to school .
because the other children have parents , they immediately realize that someone who has no parents is a cri@@ adi@@ ta .
I couldn &apos;t invite anyone to visit me at home . I had no circle of friends at school or in the neighborhood .
in my youth , in the time when friend@@ ships arise , I felt particularly clear that I was not a member of any group .
isolation was the worst of all , &quot; says Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a .
the Company appro@@ ves the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go
in January 2015 , a woman published the following text in a Facebook group , where you can share job ads for cleaning staff and child girls in Paraguay .
the Administrator of the group is Pep@@ a Kos@@ ti@@ an@@ ov@@ sky , a coun@@ cill@@ or in the district of As@@ unci@@ Ã³n .
hi ! I &apos;m looking for a little companion for my little daughter who plays with her in the morning and in the afternoon .
to learn .
please report to you .
starting on Monday , if possible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the ad got five &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Li@@ kes &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and many comments . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a woman from the place Ã@@ em@@ by wrote that she had an el@@ event@@ h girl and gave her phone number .
another woman who also came out of Ã@@ em@@ by offered her 15 @-@ year @-@ old ni@@ ece . &quot; she likes small children and is very pretty , &quot; she wrote .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the third comment , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a girl from the interior that wants to work &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
then the cham@@ fer@@ ing in the ad turned out again :
dear friends , I have found one . I look as if it works with her .
thank you very much , I write again when something is .
the business was finished .
in the pro@@ lo@@ gue to the report of Cri@@ adi@@ tas , Â¿ ha@@ sta cu@@ ans@@ do ?
( Cri@@ adi@@ tas , for how long ? ) , a collection of testim@@ onies of former Cri@@ adi@@ tas , writes Or@@ ti@@ z :
in the course of our history we managed to abol@@ ish systems such as slavery , Cu@@ Ã±@@ ad@@ az@@ go ( a practice from the early history of Paraguay ) , where the Spanish conqu@@ er@@ ors , the Con@@ qui@@ stad@@ ores , the women of Guar@@ an@@ Ã­ were ens@@ la@@ ved and subjected to Spanish in@@ doctr@@ ination ) and the system of the Spanish Con@@ qui@@ stad@@ ores ( where the Spanish conqu@@ er@@ ors had to pay tribute to them ) and the Spanish conqu@@ er@@ ors went into a system of slavery , where they become light victims of abuse and exploitation .
social ine@@ quality in Paraguay and that showing power are the key to understanding the phenomenon known as Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go .
draft law prescri@@ bes Egyptian users of social media to register with the government

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sixty straight Egyptian parliam@@ ent@@ arians voted &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Regulation on the use and benefits of social networks &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if it is accepted by Parliament , users and users of social media in Egypt must register with a government agency to use social media including Facebook and Twitter . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the basis of the law , a place would be set up to give citizens a permission to use social media . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
within six months with the adoption of the law , users would have to register on the website of the site with their proper names and identity card numbers in order to be able to use social networks .
if this fails to do so , it could result in a penalty of up to six months in prison or a fin@@ es .
the bill , which consists of six paragra@@ phs and is cur@@ ated in local media including You@@ m@@ 7 and Egypt Independent , defines social media as &quot; any application that runs and uses over the Internet to communicate with others by voice , video messages and text . &quot;
it is unclear how the law is enforced when it is accepted , as the draft does not indicate how Egyptian authorities should impose the registration on users . it is also unclear how they should account for those who do not register in view of the fact that the Egyptian government is currently not able to ensure regulation on the level of social media companies .
Ri@@ y@@ ad Ab@@ dul Satt@@ ler , MP and promot@@ er of the bill , told the magazine Al @-@ Monitor , registered users were given a username and password from the telecommunications minister to get through the fire@@ wall that blocks Facebook . &quot;
this could mean Egypt is planning to build a fire@@ wall at national level around Facebook . it would be necessary for Egyptians to submit information on their identity in order to access the network .
but it is not known until now that such plans exist .
experts on site are scep@@ tical regarding the technical feasibility of the proposal .
Ram@@ y Ra@@ o@@ of , Senior Research techn@@ ologist ( in German &quot; conducting research &quot; ) of the Egyptian Initiative for Human Rights ( E@@ IP@@ R , in German &quot; Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights &quot; ) , told Global Vo@@ ices :
I strongly doubt the technical capacities and understanding of any authority in Egypt regarding things related to technology .
in my opinion , they imagine that just as they viol@@ ently control public and private spaces , it could also be done online .
if I take them seriously , it means they will establish a strong surveillance system to filter out citizens who apply for a permit or not . and that is a crazy system to monitor people &apos;s activities and also to bring them to a court process .
this is technically not realistic - but everything is possible in Egypt .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in order to be adopted as a law , the draft must first be discussed at the Parliament &apos;s legislative and constitutional committees before going into the plenary debate . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
whether its acceptance and enforcement will succeed or not , the draft &quot; is in line with a pro @-@ military way of thinking in parliament , in which the control will be maxim@@ ized and ensured that no devi@@ ating nar@@ ration on the image surface is present , &quot; says Ra@@ o@@ of .
last year , the MP Tam@@ er El @-@ Sha@@ haw@@ y proposed a law@@ suit against cy@@ ber crime in which a lifel@@ ong sentence for those found guilty of threatening &quot; public order &quot; and &quot; to protest . &quot;

high up in the mountains of Kur@@ dist@@ an in the north @-@ east of Iraq , the animal prot@@ ector H@@ ana Ah@@ med R@@ aza and her team of scientists from the NGO &quot; Nature Iraq &quot; are working to protect the gh@@ ost@@ ly Persian le@@ op@@ ards .
a sub@@ species of the greater le@@ op@@ ard family , which wi@@ pes through Africa and Asia , belongs to the Persian le@@ op@@ ards ( Pan@@ ther@@ a Par@@ dus sax@@ ic@@ ol@@ or ) . altogether , there are between 800 and 1,000 animals , so the International Union for Conservation of Nature . they are endangered due to po@@ aching , loss and frag@@ mentation of their habitat and since they find ever less loo@@ t .
why is this particular species of le@@ op@@ ards so important ?
as R@@ aza shows in the video , &quot; the Persian le@@ op@@ ard is the only remaining pre@@ dat@@ or in the Kurdish ecosystem , &quot; and the health and thri@@ ving of the ecosystem also depends on the fact that there is a big pre@@ dat@@ or .
the chance to actually see a Persian le@@ op@@ ard is small and goes against zero . when the team in the video determines that they have a big cat in the c@@ amer@@ af@@ all , R@@ aza breaks out in pure joy .
as a trained bi@@ ologist , R@@ aza loves to show a different side of her country , which consists not only of war and conflict .
she has been involved in field studies on wild animals and educational programs in Nature Iraq for six years .
since 2013 , it has been a member of the IU@@ CN / SS@@ C Cat Speci@@ alist Group and is committed to ensuring that protected areas for wildlife in the Kur@@ dist@@ an region are established .

in early March 2017 , K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o , the responsible daily for nor@@ theastern Japan , documented the progress made over the past six years to rebuild the lives of those affected by the &quot; triple catastrophe &quot; in March 2011 . a massive earthquake , a ts@@ un@@ ami and an atom accident in Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma had caused disaster .
the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper has its headquarters in Sen@@ dai , located in Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i Pre@@ f@@ ecture . Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i pre@@ f@@ ecture was a local pre@@ f@@ ecture in Japan &apos;s northeast , which had to experience both the earthquake and the ts@@ un@@ ami .
hundreds of thousands of people from Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and the neighbour@@ hoods Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma and I@@ w@@ ate were evacu@@ ated , because the ts@@ un@@ ami had caused whole coastal towns to disappear from the map .
in addition , Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma pre@@ f@@ ecture experienced a nuclear accident , and already alone 160 000 inhabitants had to leave their homes .
from a local perspective , the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o &apos;s special report shows which progress has been achieved six years later in order to rebuild the lives of local residents .
the detailed report of the paper includes both the statistics of the Japanese reconstruction authority and the survey results of the affected persons themselves .
the housing situation in Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma , Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate
the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper reports that up to December 2015 , 77 per cent of the planned replacement houses ( &quot; sa@@ ig@@ ai k@@ ou@@ ei ju@@ ut@@ ak@@ u &quot; ) were completed in the Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma , Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures .
Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i was able to see the biggest success among the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures , here 80 percent of the planned spare houses were completed .
I@@ w@@ ate has completed 75 percent of such houses whereas Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma forms the final light by 70 percent .
however , even six years after the catastrophe , we still endeav@@ our to res@@ ett@@ le into final replacement houses six years after the disaster .
after the thre@@ ef@@ old disaster almost 80@@ ,000 people saw themselves forced to live in lodging establishments .
in December 2016 more and more people from Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i , Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma and I@@ w@@ ate still lived in such dwell@@ ings .
almost 40 percent of those evacu@@ ated from Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma in 2011 still live in emergency shel@@ ters , whereas Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i was more successful . more than 75 per cent of the evacu@@ ees , who were living after the disaster in lodging establishments , were reloc@@ ated to final homes .
for I@@ w@@ ate , the figure is 34 percent .
the state of work and everyday life in the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures concerned
as the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper was able to determine , 10@@ 74 of 1,@@ 100 schools that were affected by mis@@ fortune have opened their doors until December 2016 , which accounts for almost 98 percent of the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures schools .
six years later , it is clear that industrial reconstruction in the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures is much more difficult .
while nearly 100 per cent of the fishing ports in I@@ w@@ ate and Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i are now in operation , only 30 percent of the fishing ports have resum@@ ed their operation in Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma .
the ts@@ un@@ ami and the nuclear accident have affected large areas in the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures of Agriculture .
Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i was able to restore 93 percent of its agricultural areas , with only 66 percent of arable land in I@@ w@@ ate and less than 50 percent destroyed farm@@ land in Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma .
it is unlikely that this is only a consequence of the nuclear accident , because only 6@@ 90 hectares of land @-@ destroyed farm@@ land of Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma is located in the &quot; nuclear lock zone . &quot;
in two of the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures the tourism has recovered largely , but also here Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma stays far off .
the tourist numbers in Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate are up to 90 per cent on the same level as before the disaster . Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma , on the other hand , can only show 75 percent .
however , the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper also reports that since the disaster almost half of the coast inhabitants , it is more difficult to make a living .
is the native population prepared for the next great earthquake ?
in order to be able to determine the overall picture , the newspaper has conducted numerous surveys among the local population and among the evacu@@ ees . she questioned her about the state of reconstruction and how her emp@@ athy has changed over the ts@@ un@@ ami risk .
in their introduction to the article , the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper explains :
the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o conducted a survey to learn more about the ts@@ un@@ ami awareness among the local population .
the survey showed that 8@@ 3.1 percent of local residents have taken measures to prepare for future earthqu@@ akes and ts@@ un@@ am@@ is .
however , 5@@ 5.@@ 9 percent of those surv@@ eyed said that still not enough in disasters prevention was done .
as for those who had to evacu@@ ate the Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma pre@@ f@@ ecture
in its issue on the anniversary of the earthquake , the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper has also focused its attention on the situation of the evacu@@ ees from Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma .
Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma had to experience not only the enormous earthquake and the devastating ts@@ un@@ ami , no , Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma pre@@ f@@ ecture also witnessed the worst disa@@ strous , nuclear accident that Japan had ever had to experience .
of 160@@ ,000 evacu@@ ees from Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma , nearly 63@@ ,000 people were transferred to areas outside the pre@@ f@@ ecture .
at the beginning of 2016 some more than 23@@ ,000 people , back to Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma , were en@@ no@@ bled into permanent replacement houses .
after the state of 2017 still 40,000 inhabitants of Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma live outside their home pre@@ f@@ ecture .
in the disaster areas most of the evacu@@ ees , who still live under administrative skills , are older than 50 years old . they are well known because efforts to rebuild Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i , I@@ w@@ ate and Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma need to compete with massive construction projects . these are construction projects that are part of the Olympic Games that will take place in Tokyo by 2020 .
the world is small : our pod@@ cast &quot; In@@ to the Deep &quot;
when people meet people from other countries who speak a different language , the differences seem to be greater than the simil@@ arities .
however , after a while one recognizes that a more connects than it seems at first sight .
these global connections are important , as they challenge our prejudi@@ ces , expand our perspectives and remind us that the world is ultimately very small .
in this episode of In@@ to the Deep , the Global Vo@@ ices Pod@@ cast , we look closely at these global connections . in our In@@ to the Deep Pod@@ cast we deal with topics that often get less attention in reporting than they deserve .
we speak to five Global Vo@@ ices members who recall a moment in which they have felt very strongly connected with someone beyond language and country borders .

Brazilian activ@@ ist in artificial coma after being beaten up by the police at nationwide demonstrations

right : Mat@@ eus F@@ errei@@ ra da Silva on a widespread photo .
a Brazilian student at the age of 33 was delivered this week to the intensive care unit : last Friday , a police officer during a demonstration in Go@@ i@@ Ã¢@@ nia had beaten him against his head during a demonstration in Go@@ i@@ Ã¢@@ nia . nationwide , millions of demonstr@@ ators took part in a protest march against austerity measures .
Mat@@ eus F@@ errei@@ ra da Silva , who studied social sciences at the University of Go@@ i@@ Ã¡s , has suffered a skull @-@ brain trauma and several frac@@ tures .
doctors have operated on this Saturday and have now transferred him to an artificial coma .
his condition is considered critical .
the local photo journalist Lu@@ iz da Lu@@ z made photos of the attack on Mat@@ eus , which spread rapidly in Brazil within a few days .
on the pictures is also the face of the police officer who attacked with a bat@@ on . the man was identified as August@@ o S@@ amp@@ ai@@ o .
after the incident , the military police in the Brazilian state of Go@@ i@@ Ã¡s announced that S@@ amp@@ ai@@ o was suspended until the conclusion of the investigation into the incident .
the pictures show the police officer how he strikes in Go@@ i@@ Ã¢@@ nia with his stick on the face of the student Mat@@ eus F@@ errei@@ ra ( photos : Lu@@ iz da Lu@@ z ) .
if a police officer was beaten by a demonstr@@ ator and landing on the intensive care unit , his face would be on television for six months and the entire repression would be justified .
the Facebook page &quot; Des@@ ne@@ aliz@@ ador , &quot; a press channel of media activists from Go@@ i@@ Ã¢@@ nia , shared the video recorded by Lu@@ iz da Lu@@ z on the net in which one sees how Mat@@ eus is attacked by the police officer and several param@@ edi@@ cs suddenly ha@@ sten to it .
another video filmed with the same scenes but filmed from another perspective is also di@@ pped into social networks .
in the clip shown below you can see the attack on Mat@@ eus from the 50@@ th second .
for the family of Mat@@ eus , who lives in another state , Internet users have now donated 10,000 Brazilian Re@@ ais ( about 2,@@ 700 euros ) to cover a part of the cost of medical treatment and to allow his family to stay in Go@@ i@@ Ã¢@@ nia while he is in hospital .
&quot; be brave , Mat@@ eus .

on Facebook , Professor Pablo Ort@@ ell@@ ado calls for further violence against activists in Go@@ i@@ Ã¡s :
Go@@ i@@ Ã¡s experiences a wave of political violence : here , the activ@@ ist Gu@@ il@@ u@@ me Irish was assass@@ inated by his father , because he supported the Occup@@ y movement in secondary schools . here , the Military Police of a W@@ hat@@ s@@ App Group was accused of crimin@@ al@@ ising the Occup@@ y movement . and now we have the very sad case of Mat@@ eus F@@ errei@@ ra da Silva who was attacked by a police officer who had struck him with a hammer .
police Hand@@ les
Go@@ i@@ Ã¡s was not the only country in Brazil where brutal police action against demonstr@@ ators passed last Friday .
police officers were deployed in protests in the centre of Rio de Janeiro , where demonstr@@ ators had set up a stage for speakers , rub@@ bers and tear gas .
the MP Fla@@ vio Ser@@ af@@ ini , Socialist and Peace Party ( P@@ SO@@ L ) , asked the police to refrain from violence against demonstr@@ ators via speaker announcements .
this includes a report in Fol@@ ha de S. Paulo , one of the oldest newspapers throughout the country .
once again , the Brazilian media have disgu@@ ised street protests by directing the focus to another unexpected protagon@@ ist : a wind@@ shield .
the Fol@@ ahs de S. Paulo and Est@@ ado de S. Paulo were specifically reporting on a broken glass window to illustrate their title pages illustr@@ atively .
on the other hand , the O Glob@@ o preferred a cover story with a bus set in fire .
there is no plau@@ sible journ@@ alistic reason to report more about a broken window of windows than the protests of thousands of people serving a special cause .
this must also be recognised if one is strictly opposed to any form of damage .
here , too , the term &quot; v@@ and@@ alism &quot; gets an absur@@ dity , dispro@@ portion@@ ate significance , and the typical acts of violence of the military police are obsc@@ ured by head@@ lines with the title &quot; prot@@ esters on confrontation course with the police . &quot;
the villages in Cuba that are forgotten by the de@@ duction
with the introduction of the Ã@@ l@@ varo Re@@ yn@@ oso law , almost hundreds of sugar cane factories in all of Cuba closed the doors ( Photo : Juli@@ o B@@ ati@@ sta )
the folk community Greg@@ orio Ar@@ le@@ Ã© Ma@@ Ã±@@ al@@ ich , located in the western Cuban province of May@@ abe@@ que , is generally known as el Central - in Spanish sugar mill , despite the fact that there is no notable sugar harvest locally .
it is two years ago when the activities in the sugar cane factories were paraly@@ sed .
after exhaus@@ tion , the sugar cane industry was still in the region , and the factory gradually lost its facilities until only the steel and concrete sc@@ aff@@ ol@@ ding remained .
about 27@@ 2 workers had to inv@@ ent themselves anew .
some changed the work .
others res@@ ig@@ ned and commu@@ te every day to factories that still gr@@ ind .
N@@ ene , a soldier veter@@ an who rises every day at 4 : 00 o &apos;clock in the morning , the crisis in the sugar cane industry doesn &apos;t ro@@ b his sleep .
he heard that there are sugar cane factories in the east of the region , which are back in operation after a long in@@ active time , because they were received .
that was something he did not expect .
N@@ ene remembered that Ma@@ Ã±@@ al@@ ich would receive the sugar cane Factory , but the promise was not kept .
the sugar cane industry has with@@ stood the pl@@ agues , the fall of socialism , the low market prices , in@@ efficiency , poor management decisions and climate change .
in 2016 , production amounted to 1.6 million tonnes of sugar , less than the quantity produced in 1910 .
the news would have been a subject of alarm for the country some decades ago , but the bad harv@@ ests are no longer a novel@@ ty .
why was the Cuban sugar cane industry switched off ?
the old railway platform of the municipality already saw better times .
( photo : Juli@@ o B@@ ati@@ sta )
the reduction of the sugar cane industry was an economic necessity : the 155 sugar cane factories were technically out@@ dated , and barely competitive , they became unbe@@ arable for the country .
the initial idea was to concentrate production on the most efficient factories , the annual production target was 4 million tons .
they left only the factories that could produce sugar for at most 4 Cent@@ av@@ os ( 0.@@ 03 Euro ) .
the solution for unemployment ?
the motives that led to such measures were the low productivity of sugar cane plant@@ ations and the sugar crisis on the global market .
however , sugar prices rose again about a decade ago .
from 2017 to 20@@ 25 , the price of un@@ refined sugar must remain between 15 and 16 Cent@@ av@@ os per pound , according to the report published in 2016 by the OECD and FAO , the United Nations Agri@@ cultural and Food Organisation .
if the current production would reach the level of 2001 ( 3.6 million tonnes ) , the raw sugar export would generate approximately 85 million dollars for the country .
not everything went well
&quot; today &apos;s day will certainly go into history , &quot; these were the first words of Cuban President F@@ ide@@ l Castro during his speech on October 21 , 2002 at the sugar factory in Lav@@ ander@@ o .
from then on , the process of restructuring began in the sugar industry .
in the following years , the shut@@ down of a total of 98 sugar cane factories , more than 65 million people , received their full sal@@ aries for further education .
the same thing happened in the Greg@@ orio Ar@@ l@@ Ã©e Ma@@ Ã±@@ al@@ ich sugar cane factory on May 14 , 2004 .
Luis Alberto PÃ©@@ rez has been working in the factory since 1967 .
when N@@ ene , as he is known as a soldier , talks about the closure of the factory , the word he repe@@ ats most is &quot; dec@@ eit . &quot;
almost all respon@@ dents said : not one of them was informed that the factory would be shut down .
in order for the place to be preserved , they formed a full @-@ time working group .
before the first gradu@@ ation year , the first letters began to come .
these were officially recorded documents , which were only differentiated with regard to the parts that would be removed , the add@@ res@@ see and the date .
all were signed by Ul@@ mich Ros@@ ales del Toro , only the Minister could appro@@ ve any withdrawal .
from then on , responsibility was postpon@@ ed and the letters became more and more frequent .
Juan Carlos Ri@@ ver@@ o was responsible for the factory shut down for two years and he was one who received the letters . &quot; the country had no money for the sugar cane factories that were still in use , &quot; he ass@@ ures .
Ed@@ dy Re@@ yes , 64 years , is waiting for retirement in another facility , the Boris Luis Santa Col@@ oma .
against his will he was involved in the shut@@ down of the factory , in whose construction he helped .
with every part he removed , he dis@@ assembled one of his 31 years of work .
the best developed industrial area of Cuba and the most important working place was extingu@@ ished .
in many cases , there were no alternatives to the work places and services that the plants generated in the congregations in which they were located .
we will never know if during the M@@ amm@@ ut speech of 21 October 2002 , the then president looked into the eyes of the people present when he guaranteed that for the areas whose factories were no longer in use for five years , everything would go well .

after two years , the folk community Greg@@ orio Ar@@ le@@ Ã© Ma@@ Ã±@@ al@@ ich became acquainted with many things , but not always for the better when a factory is closed .
when the sugar cane factory closed , or rather , when they began to mo@@ an it , they also stopped to asp@@ hal@@ ate the road , this dis@@ advant@@ aged other farms .
without work in the region , and with advanced age , N@@ ene and Ed@@ dy had to visit other factories .
they became spare parts .
without a prospects for the future , many young people left the region .
in the area a food factory was created whose production does not even serve the care of the community .
the ruins of the factory behind the new plant are still imposing .
at the end of 2016 , N@@ ene returned to the factory Boris Luis Santa Col@@ oma , the ruins of the place where he began to work .
forty @-@ nine harv@@ ests brought the old soldier a rent of two thousand pes@@ o a month to spend the years in the retirement in Ma@@ Ã±@@ al@@ ich .
Mr. N@@ ene , a man of black skin color , small , with few teeth and clear voice , is not a suppor@@ tive person , yet he does not forgive the lies they told him .
they have tor@@ tured him for ten years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; N@@ ene goes into retirement at 65 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not because it lacks power , but because it is bitter . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

first Nations young people use hip @-@ hop to express themselves and preserve their own culture
inclusion of a song from &quot; Home to Me &quot; - Gr@@ assy Nar@@ rows First Nation .

young people of the First Nations communities across Canada deal with topics that are important to them . they do this using hip hop thanks to a series of hiking workshops .
as part of the N &apos;@@ we J@@ in@@ an tour , workshop leaders have been bringing mobile audio studios directly to schools and youth centres to teach youth groups song@@ writing , recording , audio and video production and live performances .
the original workshops were led by the educ@@ ator David Ho@@ dges who lives in Montreal and worked in North Que@@ bec with ten C@@ ree communities and then collabor@@ ated with the C@@ ree Hip @-@ Hop Group The Nor@@ th@@ stars .
the workshop thus assumes that the young participants discuss topics such as &quot; cultural identity , language , conflict , love , acceptance , &quot; or whatever comes to mind .
these questions are inspiration for songs and videos in which the young people are the protagon@@ ists .
because the workshops were so popular , the team worked with other First Nations Communities in the Canadian province of British Columbia and was invited to organize similar workshops with the tribe of Win@@ ne@@ bul@@ ago in the US state of Neb@@ ras@@ ka .
this video of the school &apos; Na Ak@@ sa Gy@@ il@@ ak &apos; Yo@@ o in the area of the tribe of the Kit@@ hum@@ kal@@ um First Nation in British Columbia , for example , tells the story of Highway 16 , also called &quot; Highway of tears , &quot; a road section in western Canada , on which nearly two dozen mostly indigenous young women were disappeared or murdered .
the cases were largely unknown .
the next video of the Nem@@ as@@ ka C@@ ree First Nation uses the motif of a video game to convey how important it is to preserve traditional customs and customs despite the influences of global@@ isation .
many of the songs appeared in indigenous languages , although the young people are not always able to master the languages of the First Nations .
in the following song that the Wh@@ ap@@ mag@@ oo@@ st@@ i C@@ ree First Nation has recorded , the chor@@ us is sung on C@@ ree .
the young people involved got some help from Gary J@@ ol@@ ly from the Nor@@ th@@ stars Hip @-@ Hop group , who gave them a verse in the Eastern James Bay C@@ ree dialect .
on the Facebook page of N &apos;@@ we J@@ in@@ an the verse is available as well as a translation into English , which is translated into German :
sometimes I feel like nobody ever is interested in me
but I try to keep my days on earth
this is the day when you will hear our cry
because we as a youth have lost our way in life
but I believe that we will rise one day
I don &apos;t want to see how they live a bad life
so they can grow and go forward as well as our youth
so they can do what they intended for the Creator
in the comments section , the reader and supporters of the C@@ ree @-@ language Kevin Bro@@ us@@ se@@ au also make a contribution and add the verse in sy@@ ll@@ able ( which is also published on his blog and is published here with permission ) :
in Japan , plastic courts are not only shown in the restaurant
plastic @-@ based ( &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; outside of a typical restaurant in Japan . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

in Japan , you can see plastic dishes almost every restaurant .
to show potential customers what is on the menu , near the entrance sh@@ ok@@ u@@ hin san@@ pur@@ u ( &quot; plastic models of dishes &quot; ) are issued by each dish served in this restaurant .
customers will see these plastic courts and decide whether they will enter or continue the restaurant .
there is a whole industry dedicated to the manufacture of these plastic dishes .
there are a number of small companies in the Tokyo district of Kapp@@ ab@@ ashi , who are producing those plastic dishes that the German film@@ maker W@@ im Wen@@ ders documented in his film Tokyo @-@ G@@ a more than 20 years ago .
for most Japanese , these plastic dishes are so common that they don &apos;t even notice them anymore . however , a new trend is turning them into show@@ y mobile accessories and other gad@@ gets .
in Na@@ ver Mat@@ ome , the blo@@ gger it@@ ini@@ i published a series of social media links and photos showing this unusual twist with the sh@@ ok@@ u@@ hin sin@@ pur@@ u .
now in special sale : new mobile tape decorated with plastic rib@@ bons , as shown in the K@@ ich@@ i@@ jo@@ ji Tok@@ y@@ u department store .
many of these artificial food items were converted to kit@@ sch@@ y collection objects , as in this case , fridge magn@@ ets :
here are some sho@@ ku@@ hin fridge magn@@ ets for a new exhibition at the Tokyo Station .
the new boom in ess@@ ences is becoming increasingly sophisticated .
in this case an ka@@ isen @-@ don ( a popular rice dish with seafood ) has been transformed into a mobile phone stand .
for this tri@@ angular Bow@@ l ( lo@@ l ) we found a good use as a mobile phone .
we have also made this part of the exhibition at the Tokyo railway station .
and here is an apple that holds your cell phone :
designed to look like an apple , with a not@@ ch for the mobile phone , this is already a great design .
and that &apos;s just the beginning of an increasing flight into the comic .
some mobile tel@@ eph@@ ones and mobile designers allow you to create your own work of art . in this case , i@@ kur@@ a or salmon ro@@ am is used , a popular t@@ opping that is served with white rice .
on Twitter , some users had their doubts :
is there anyone who would say : &quot; wow , cool , now I can decorate my cell phone with laughter ? &quot;
I think I will be the only one .
this interest in plastic courts can also take on a less appeti@@ zing form , for example to surprise colleagues or family members unpleasant .
our latest mobile phone stand has the form of melting ice .
in addition , there are also rice balls ( O@@ ni@@ gir@@ i ) , earrings and hand@@ y@@ bands from dried salmon .
other bizarre plastic dishes can be seen at : it@@ ini@@ i &apos;s Na@@ ver Mat@@ ome blog post . or follow Twitter the h@@ ash@@ tag # .
if you would like to learn more about the origin of this trend , this video gives you an insight into the district of Kapp@@ ab@@ ashi , which is devoted to the supply of the restaurant industry .
the following video shows how Japanese plastic dishes are actually produced .
a Mexican project tells stories of the survivors of the struggle against organised crime
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the victims of the fight against drug traffi@@ ckers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

in reports of domestic and foreign media about the not@@ orious &quot; fight against drug traffi@@ cking &quot; in Mexico , the extre@@ mis@@ sts and killed frequently only appear in statistics but these do not reflect the extent of the human tragedy that this struggle ent@@ ails .
the coverage of drug bos@@ ses such as El Chap@@ o Gu@@ z@@ m@@ Ã¡n , the leader of the Sin@@ alo@@ a cart@@ el , totally pushed the stories of the victims of the conflict into the background .
the day after a violent incident , hardly anyone looks at the gri@@ eving or the churches that have learned to live with the pain .
behind each corp@@ se , behind every bone find in the hundreds of secret graves , the stories of countless parents , sons and daughters , friends and partners whose wounds may never be healed .
this is why the Mexican news portal Ani@@ mal Pol@@ Ã­@@ ti@@ co has launched the digital project &quot; A@@ pr@@ ender a Vi@@ vir C@@ on El Nar@@ co &quot; ( German : &quot; living with drug traffi@@ cking &quot; ) , which is supposed to give a voice to these victims and stories of people who were involved in the struggle between law enforcement agencies and cart@@ els .
Ani@@ mal Pol@@ Ã­@@ ti@@ co describes the project so :
organized crime does not only allow us to fear our lives .
the effects are far more profound .
for example , when businesses close because they are threatened by drug traffi@@ ckers and entire communities need to drive many kilometres to buy something as simple as milk .
the pain of the victims
a video with the title &quot; Vi@@ das que Cam@@ bian p@@ or el mi@@ edo &quot; ( German : &quot; how fear life changes &quot; ) tells exactly these stories .
a main character is Guadal@@ up@@ e , a father who searches for secret graves after his son every weekend .
or Emma Vel@@ eta Ro@@ dr@@ Ã­@@ gu@@ ez , who lost her father only one day , her four si@@ bl@@ ings , her husband and two of her ne@@ ph@@ ews .
priests : &quot; like every Sunday we prepare ourselves today for the task we have set ourselves to go and look for tom@@ bs , the people we have loved . &quot;
Guadal@@ up@@ e Con@@ tr@@ eras : &quot; my son is called Antonio Ivan Con@@ tr@@ eras Mat@@ a .
he was 28 when he disappeared .
he has three children .
he worked in an electrical business in El Nar@@ an@@ jo .
on 13 October , he left the house .
on October 15th he should be back again , but he never returned . &quot; Emma Vel@@ eta : &quot; it is very difficult for me , because I am now alone with three children who need a training .
there is also my mother , who is here with me as well .
at the moment she has no income .
you are the insurance of my father , but she does not pay it out because they require a death certificate .
where should we get it ? &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the editors of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A@@ pr@@ ender a vivi@@ r con el Nar@@ co &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explain why the project is so important : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need not only show the faces of those who are afraid . we must show the international community the conflicts , frag@@ ility and state leadership . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the project is based on stories of readers and reports by journalists in high @-@ risk areas .
here are some excer@@ pts from the stories .
K@@ Y@@ H@@ B , a reader of Ani@@ mal Pol@@ Ã­@@ ti@@ co , wrote this post from Tax@@ co , in the state of Gu@@ err@@ ero in Central Mexico .
your contribution reminds us that violence should never be regarded as normal , no matter what form it occurs :
I have known illness and sensational journ@@ alism for a number of years now .
I come across newspaper ki@@ os@@ ks every day and see the pages with images that actually only come from a text@@ book for crimin@@ ology or from files from specialists .
it brings me out of the frame .
sometimes I feel as if I am the only one who is disgu@@ sted or sad . it works like a lack of respect for the person who once belonged to this body .
I can &apos;t be in@@ different or consider this to be normal .
she writes on :
no , it &apos;s not normal that my 10 @-@ year @-@ old c@@ ousin thinks he wants Nar@@ co ( German : drug dealers ) when he is big . and it is also not normal that people hear songs about the &quot; hero@@ ic &quot; of the offen@@ ders when they go through the streets .
for me it is as if they ridi@@ cul@@ ed those who have lost someone and those who fear that something happens to them .
I see our weakness , when stories become mere figures in a statisti@@ c .
the in@@ som@@ nia of the people is incredible for me , when the death of six people and the disappearance of 43 students in a neighboring village are justified by the fact that they were &quot; so@@ aked . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think they try to convince themselves that they are spar@@ ed from such trage@@ dies when they are not stirring and still . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mari@@ bel L. from Mexico City wrote the contribution &quot; Four months black@@ mail in the Capital District : how a family was pl@@ under@@ ed with threats . &quot; in this she describes how armed criminals were black@@ ma@@ iled for month money from their business until they had torn apart the business , but also torn off their family apart .
you are thinking about everything you have lost and how some people can completely change your entire life in just a few days .
the pain never passes , the trauma remains , the fear comes up again when you are alone .
habits have changed , phone numbers too .
we only contact us if it is absolutely necessary .
the far@@ ther we are from each other , the better .
she closed her report with the words :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want the others to be arrested because they don &apos;t know when they will dec@@ eive or kill you . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I asked myself in these aw@@ ful days whether crying would dissolve my deep @-@ rooted feelings , but the answer is no , because I forgot how to we@@ ep . I must learn to live with the pain .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the journalist Mario Gu@@ ti@@ Ã©r@@ rez Vega published the article &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The forgotten children of Ci@@ u@@ dad Ju@@ Ã¡@@ rez &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the introduction , he raises questions like : who cares for the child of a missing woman and a man who was murdered by organised crime ?
how is it to grow up in a settlement on the edge of Mexico &apos;s most dangerous city ?
he is not like other boys of his age , whose parents care about them .
Br@@ yan is a orph@@ an and he says he had to teach himself how to cook an egg , s@@ own potatoes , make tor@@ till@@ as warm and make Chi@@ chi for the babies who live with him . this is his name for the preparation of the bottles with water , sugar and milk powder .
he tells of the nine sc@@ ars on his left leg - one for each year of life .
but they are in@@ significant compared to the pain in his eyes - un@@ speak@@ able for a boy for whom all life consists of violence and who had to learn to live with it .
when he was five years old , he told him that his mother had disappeared .
but this was not the day when his childhood ended .
his childhood was past two years before , when he was only a few blocks away from his home , seeing the bloody corp@@ se of his father who had been shot by armed men from a passing car .
when Br@@ yan was born , the situation in Ju@@ Ã¡@@ rez looked like this :
Br@@ yan was born in 2006 , when violence was viol@@ ated by organised crime and the struggle against the already existing social problems in Ju@@ Ã¡@@ rez .
in 2008 , 2009 and 2010 , Ju@@ Ã¡@@ rez was the most dangerous city in the world due to the number of mur@@ ders according to the Public Security Council and Government of the Government of the United States .
in 2010 alone , the public prosec@@ utor &apos;s office amounted to 3@@ 103 kill@@ ings . this corresponds to an average of 8.5 murder per day .
these are just a few of hundreds of thousands of stories that leave the organized crime in Mexico and penetrate the soul of the country .
only a few stories continue to live in the face of ever new head@@ lines . however , this project reminds us of those we are not allowed to forget .
in addition to the project &quot; A@@ pr@@ ender a Vi@@ vir C@@ on El Nar@@ co , &quot; Ani@@ mal Pol@@ Ã­@@ ti@@ co 2015 launched the data journ@@ alism project Nar@@ co@@ data , whose objective is to illustrate the complex information behind the failed fight against drug traffi@@ cking , which has tor@@ mented the country during the last four decades .
if a picture is worth a thousand un@@ true words
&quot; sharing is Car@@ ing &quot; by Fli@@ ck@@ r user Ni@@ kl@@ as Wi@@ k@@ strÃ¶m ( CC @-@ B@@ Y @-@ NC 2.0 ) W@@ AR@@ N@@ MENT : this article and the pages that he links include images on which violence is depicted .
the fact check is important in a moment when it comes to raising a rum@@ or or expos@@ ing a fake .
but what about the years after something has appeared ? content in social media , whether true or un@@ true , tends to continue to exist .
take this photo of a terrible accident seven years ago in the Democratic Republic of Congo ( DRC ) .
since its first publication , it has been mis@@ leading to manipul@@ ate trage@@ dies that have actually taken place in Nigeria or Myanmar .
this incorrect coupling of picture and event - &quot; false description &quot; or &quot; false context &quot; in the terminology of Global Vo@@ ices or First Dra@@ ft News - does not deny the fact that there is ample careful reporting on events in the DR Congo , Myanmar and Nigeria .
but it raises questions about our desire for images of news .
what happened in the Democratic Republic of the Congo
in 2010 a tank truck crossed the town of S@@ ange in the east of the DR Congo , til@@ ted around and explo@@ ded . 230 people died .
after the civil war , Africa &apos;s second @-@ largest country has been neglected and devast@@ ated for years . roads in the region have become a dangerous path full of po@@ thol@@ es that were difficult to navigate .
tra@@ gically , the tank wagon fell victim to it .
officials described a fire@@ ball that envel@@ op@@ ed dozens of houses , including a movie theater nearby , which was full of people watching the World Cup .
houses scattered and char@@ ted corp@@ ses were scattered in the streets .
many people were inc@@ iner@@ ated for un@@ recogni@@ z@@ ability .
a picture with the title &quot; This is Nigeria . &quot; from the Im@@ g@@ ur user My@@ sti@@ cal Mon@@ key , January 12th , 201@@ 5.@@ Sever@@ al photos of the incident portra@@ y the dre@@ ad@@ ful scenes of this day .
above is an example of this .
it shows rows of carb@@ oni@@ zed bodies that are lined up on the floor while people look at them .
but here the story does not end .
over the years , the same photo has been resear@@ ched several times in social media , blo@@ gs and other platforms and fal@@ sely attributed to real but not related trage@@ dies , especially events in Nigeria and Myanmar .
what happened in Nigeria and Myanmar
on 3 January 2015 , comb@@ at@@ ants of B@@ oko Har@@ am attacked the remote Nig@@ eri@@ an villages of Bag@@ a and Dor@@ o G@@ ow@@ on .
e@@ ye@@ witnesses dramatically reported atro@@ cities to which they had to flee .
houses and shops were burned down and dead bodies lay in streets and bushes .
there were reports , according to which 150 to 2,000 people were massac@@ red .
but the figures could not be confirmed . &quot; nobody stayed back to count corp@@ ses , &quot; said a Human Rights Watch .
many were dis@@ member@@ ed , shot or burned .
the following time could only be illustrated by satellite images .
the occasion for the attack was also unclear , but the army base in Bag@@ a was a permanent conflict between the military Nig@@ eri@@ as and the attempt of B@@ oko Har@@ am to win the country ( examples from 2013 and 2015 ) .
and here the picture emerged from the DR Congo again , when it was fal@@ sely presented as proof of the fact and possible extent of the attack :
this is Nigeria .
a massacre of 2,000 people took place two days after Paris .
they are not Charlie .
they are dead .
indeed , this ab@@ u@@ sive use of the image of the DR Congo is only one in a number of abor@@ tions ; Africa Check has documented assignments to Nigeria since 2014 .
in all these cases the picture was presented as a proof of mass kill@@ ings .
one more step further , personal comments such as this example fal@@ sely relate the image of DR Congo with sources of the mass media in order to deliver arguments .
the picture from S@@ ange also appeared in conjunction with the deadly persecution of the Muslim Roh@@ ing@@ ya in Myanmar .
according to a flash , published by the United Nations , those who fled could flee , rape and several dead , some by burning .
while others reported about the violence against Roh@@ ing@@ ya , posts like the following appeared which brought these descriptions together with photos from the DR Congo :
this picture comes from a Saudi Arabian news page , wrong@@ ly claimed by the president of Myanmar &apos;s Th@@ ein in 2012 . monks and politicians had taken part in the murder of Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims . in addition , they had used the image of the DR Congo to model this information .
the original contribution , which was finally accessed on 26 April 2017 , can be viewed here .
other news organizations called AF@@ P as their source also fal@@ sely attributed Th@@ ein to this statement , but did not have the image associated with the DR Congo .
the worldwide range of false information
traces of this false coupling date back to 2011 and 2012 and are actually coming from all over the world .
using an &quot; reverse image search , &quot; one can see how far information can transc@@ end boundaries .
an inver@@ ted picture search with the search engine Tin@@ Eye has found 3@@ 44 pictures under 18.@@ 8 billion pictures ( as of May 3 , 2017 ) , which are very similar to the said picture of DR Congo .
they come from a mixed mas@@ ch of private pages , platforms of social media and common as well as national publications and are available in many different languages such as English , Russian , Spanish , Arabic , Dutch , German , Greek and Portuguese .
some have passed false reports , some have tried to expose counter@@ fei@@ ts .
we have del@@ ine@@ ated examples of ab@@ u@@ sive use and linked them to the respective countries , based on which side they were published . thus , we want to portra@@ y the range more clearly than by language alone .
from the countries listed below ( which in some cases were also linked with each other ) , several examples of impro@@ per use may date .
here are some cases that can now be completely sen@@ sed ( on the map in orange ) :
map : News Fra@@ mes .
examples of false copies of the image of the DR Congo with Nigeria or Myanmar .
the orange lands show pages or servers that are still available on the examples of fal@@ si@@ fications or fal@@ seh@@ oods .
the grey countries are examples that , according to the metadata and information available via the Tin@@ Eye , probably also show for@@ gery examples .
as a reminder , the source of the image is the Democratic Republic of Congo ( in blue ) .

this adjustment , which was published exclusively in English , also includes references to fake images of sc@@ aff@@ ol@@ ding molecules that H@@ ate Spe@@ ech operate and used by extrem@@ ist groups to show that Muslims kill Budd@@ hi@@ sts and vice versa ( which is often propag@@ ated by Bur@@ m@@ ese nation@@ alists ) .
Russia , 2012 . &quot; fl@@ y@@ op@@ hag@@ us &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( Christi@@ an@@ opho@@ bia or political provo@@ cation ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this post , addressed to the members of the Russian Orthodox community , clearly states that the image of the DR Congo does NOT show Muslims that kill Christians .
Saudi Arabia , 2012 / 2014 .
this news page fal@@ sely claimed that the President of Myanmar Th@@ ein admitted to being in 2012 that monks and politicians were involved in the killing of Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims and brought the story together with the picture of S@@ ange .
the article was updated in 2014 and at the time of this publication the picture is still included .
Spain , 2015 / 2016 .
this article from 2014 on students who had been killed by the B@@ oko Har@@ am published by the recently deleted news site An@@ Ã¡@@ l@@ is@@ is Digital , has expressly declared that the image is not from the kill@@ ings , but it claims that it is a &quot; similar d@@ ash attack . &quot;
when the picture was circul@@ ated in connection with the massacre of B@@ oko Har@@ am of 2015 , the newspaper El Pa@@ is attempted to dispro@@ ve that there were connections to Nigeria .
Turkey , 2015 . &quot; # Ni@@ jer@@ y@@ a@@ Yan@@ Ä±@@ y@@ or@@ DÃ¼n@@ y@@ a@@ U@@ y@@ u@@ y &quot; ( Nigeria is burning , the world is sleeping ) .
the image of the DR Congo appeared , provided with this T@@ wit@@ ter@@ h@@ ash@@ tag , and triggered a discussion among Muslims after the massacre of B@@ oko Har@@ am in 2015 and the attack on Charlie Heb@@ do in Paris .
they wanted their communities to pay greater attention to those events that allegedly occurred in the name of Islam .
United States , 2015 .
the picture was weather@@ ed as evidence of the B@@ oko Har@@ am massacre in 2015 ( and more than 9,@@ 300 times saved ) , but the messages related to it were not taken up in any religious context .
instead , the aim was to pay attention to the relative number of deaths and a comparison of media coverage compared to Nigeria and the attack against Charlie Heb@@ do .
Vietnam ( Chinese ) , 2014 .
after a message allegedly written by a &quot; father Juan Carlos Mar@@ tos &quot; about the Nig@@ eri@@ an massacre , there were discussion forums like this in Vietnam@@ ese and declared it a ho@@ ax .
from the message in which the image from the DR Congo was contained , the organization of the Clar@@ et@@ ine Mission@@ aries and Father Juan Carlos Mar@@ tos stayed away .
there are other confirmed examples of an incorrect use of the image from Sweden , Poland , Belgium , the Netherlands and Argentina .
with other accounts , aggreg@@ ators and sites in the following countries ( on the cap in grey ) , Tin@@ is also indicates , but are no longer fully trac@@ eable : Czech Republic , Australia , India , Peru , Netherlands , Ethiopia , Sri Lanka , Azerbaijan , Japan and possibly China .
( data entries with URLs and time / date stamps exist on the craw@@ ler and occasionally they have image file names associated with Nigeria or Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims . )
in all these cases , which appeared clearly after the original piece of 2010 , the picture may ultimately have a correct description , but the original contribution is not available or accessible .
frames and pictures
there are two strong topics or frames ( fra@@ ming ) that pass through these posts . the first frame focused on religion .
the photo was used in relation to greater discussions about the silence in connection with the mur@@ ders of Christians by Muslims or - for the defense of Muslims - the mur@@ ders of Roh@@ ing@@ y@@ as by Budd@@ hi@@ sts .
a second fra@@ ming uses the image to discuss how an African life is under@@ valued compared to a European or French life .
to understand religion and the value of human life is both important . therefore it is worth investigating how images are used in connection with these efforts .
a deeper question , however , is what happens if readers can no longer believe these images .
with social media , there are tens of people who have in@@ ad@@ vert@@ ently share the water around a tragedy .
suggests this mood of false and fal@@ seh@@ ood that actual atro@@ cities are un@@ true and dimin@@ ishes the real horror of what has actually happened in the DR Congo , Nigeria and Myanmar ?
the dis@@ semination of violent images has already been extensively deb@@ ated ( for example ) .
one argument is that the retention of images of a refusal is equivalent to acknowled@@ ging the tragedy . sometimes these images are even demanded of the victims themselves .
at the same time , the worry is that violent images will des@@ ensi@@ ti@@ ze readers and spectators and take the ability to feel emp@@ athy ( such as this study , which investig@@ ates how violent media are acting on helping others ) .
while there is a lot to discuss in terms of violent portra@@ y@@ als in the news media , it is a fact that they are essential for today &apos;s news reporting .
technologi@@ sts are experim@@ enting with algorithms to support the fight against &quot; fake News . &quot; they will have to think thoroughly about the situation in which a picture suggests something that can actually be used in context or in a completely ab@@ u@@ sive manner .
however , each examination of false attri@@ butions should also take into account how international they can be .

the &quot; un@@ tran@@ lat@@ able &quot; blog reveals the uniqu@@ eness of smaller languages

a blog with the name un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able ( e. g. un@@ enfor@@ ce@@ able ) ende@@ a@@ vors to offer language enthusiasts a selection of words from around the world that are difficult or not to translate at all .
these words are in every language : they express certain situations or feelings which are often very complex or specific .
some of these conf@@ using words are already well known ( like the famous Portuguese sau@@ da@@ de ) and others deeply rooted in a special culture ( for example the Spanish Sob@@ ol@@ esa ) .
but all resist stub@@ bor@@ n@@ ly every attempt of a simple translation .
a word or expression is not enough , which is why a full explanation and sometimes some context are necessary to understand exactly what is meant by this one word .
these unique words have been collected in an online list for quite a while .
most of these lists treat Japanese , German , French , Portuguese or Finnish words while the author and lingu@@ ist chose &quot; un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able &quot; Steven Bird to focus on small languages .
in the blog , for example , you can find words from Van@@ u@@ at@@ u Ta@@ xes , such as :
&quot; v@@ ak@@ ast@@ eg@@ lo@@ k &quot; - we@@ ary for your parents in recognition of your efforts in your younger years .
and words in the H@@ uns@@ ci@@ le language spoken in parts of Brazil , such as :
&quot; k@@ w@@ adi &quot; - Comfort or la@@ z@@ iness that you feel after being war@@ med up in the sun on cold days .
in Bir@@ ds &apos;s own words from his blog About :
they def@@ use other cultures , reveal other thoughts and awaken our curiosity .
sometimes you influence how we analyze the world around us and classi@@ fy the lingu@@ ists on this site even more of these &quot; conf@@ using &quot; words and show how different , valuable and impressive these small languages are .
speakers of the Treas@@ ure Langu@@ ages , highly valued by un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able , are invited to upload their favorite wines here .

how Sri Lanka ren@@ ders the worst floo@@ ding catastrophe of the decade
the island state of Sri Lanka is currently facing the worst flood and flood disaster in this decade .
triggered by the mon@@ soon , which normally ends in late May , the rivers Kal@@ u , Kel@@ ani , G@@ in , Nil@@ wal@@ a and At@@ tan@@ ag@@ al@@ u O@@ ya have tro@@ dden across the banks in 15 districts in the south and west of the country .
after a statement by the cat@@ astro@@ ph@@ ment centre of Sri Lanka of 28 May 2017 , 126 people were killed and scar@@ cely hundreds of people are missing because of the floods and slu@@ dge winds .
more than 400@@ ,000 people have been affected since last Friday ( 26 May ) and around 100,000 people were transported to 304 safe places .
the rainf@@ alls continued on Saturday ( May 27 ) , and the water levels in some areas slowly declined .
the health and hygiene conditions of the population represent a massive challenge in the affected and still in@@ accessible areas .
the following pictures and videos convey an impression of the extent of the flood disaster :
flood in Ta@@ wal@@ ama town with water levels of up to 7.5 meters . Twitter users like A@@ zz@@ am A@@ me@@ en and Sri Lanka T@@ we@@ et provide regular updates on the flood situation .
many use the h@@ ash@@ tag # F@@ loo@@ d@@ SL to monitor the extent of the disaster .
Sri Lanka &apos;s deadly floods ham@@ mer@@ ing the Den@@ gue crisis , Save the Children after further ra@@ ins are already on their way .
today morning the Nel@@ u@@ wa Bus was in high water , water level up to 6 meters . village of Mor@@ ago@@ da near G@@ alle was also flooded due to the water level of the Mor@@ o@@ go@@ da El@@ a .
the Air Force has provided five aircraft for rescue operations and another five are completed for the transport of emergency supplies for the inhabitants included in their flooded villages .
various organizations and startups have also agreed to help .
Facebook pages such as Help Flo@@ od Vic@@ tims in Sri Lanka and 2017 Dis@@ aster Relief - Information Des@@ k@@ - Sri Lanka provide important information on flood situations and humanitarian assistance .
if any search and rescue teams need dr@@ ones for their operations , please call 0@@ 77@@ 48@@ 44@@ 6@@ 39 .
for those who want to don@@ ate dry food and essential goods for flood victims -
today we are in the area around Kel@@ eni@@ ya and Him@@ but@@ ana .
please call the number 0@@ 77@@ 7@@ 44@@ 97@@ 29 or 0@@ 77@@ 7@@ 8@@ 4@@ 38@@ 41 if animals need help in this field .
the taxi call app Pick@@ Me ( Sri Lanka ) asks people to share their location data with the help of the app to inform the disaster center .
last year after the catastrophe of the Trop@@ ical Storm Ro@@ an@@ u , Pick@@ Me introduced a &quot; flood control &quot; button that allowed users to call a vehicle to pick up assistance and donations . these were then sent to the s@@ ri@@ lan@@ k@@ ish Red Cross for free .
they also introduced a &quot; S@@ OS &quot; button , which resulted in more than a thousand requests and 150 successful boat rescue operations for humans trapped by floods and land@@ slides .
the united efforts of the government and the civilian population of Sri Lanka , where several social media platforms are fully exploited , bring people in need in safety and provide aid measures .
this has prevented the loss of other human lives , with the population of Sri Lanka now the long way up to the restoration of norm@@ ality .

the Women &apos;s March on 21 January 2017 in San Francisco .
photo by Sah@@ ar Hab@@ i@@ b G@@ haz@@ i .
in January I took part in the Women &apos;s March in San Francisco with a neighbour and love girlfriend .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I trust in my four years old daughter , she entru@@ sts me with her children ; she is my rock in the fire . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the last minute we call still slo@@ gans for women &apos;s rights . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the next , we have rights for trans@@ gender .
we are located in a sea of umbrellas and people , some hold the iconic image of a woman with a head@@ sc@@ arf , bound by an American flag , others can@@ v@@ ade slo@@ gans against anti @-@ Islam hos@@ tility .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my girlfriend looks at me and says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these things don &apos;t concern you , or ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why , because I am not Muslims ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I have already conducted this conversation .
people with whom I work or people who have known me for years separate me - the Sah@@ ar they know - from the widespread concept of &quot; Muslims &quot; that developed in their idea .
they de@@ milit@@ ari@@ ze me .
there are 1.7 billion Muslims worldwide .
we don &apos;t all look the same .
we practice our religion differently .
we identify with it to be a Muslim , in different ways . but somehow we are all plug@@ ged into the same Muslim drawer .
this drawer is constructed in our collective imagination so well that as soon as Muslims , like me , do not fit into it , become Muslim .
to be Muslim
I don &apos;t ste@@ er with it alone .
this is even the poet whose poetry is most sold in America : Rum@@ i .
which pictures come to mind when you think of him ?
love ?
peace ?
when Jal@@ alu@@ d@@ din Rum@@ i was as old as I am now , he was an Orthodox Muslim pre@@ acher and schol@@ ar .
Islam , the Quran and the Prophet Muhammad were the centre of his poetry until the day when he died .
but in the western conception the religion of Rum@@ is was er@@ ased as well as from the most popular translations of his poetry .
this del@@ eting makes a large part of the history of the 1.7 billion Muslims of this world .
another consists in the reduc@@ tion@@ ist images of Muslims , which have been colon@@ ising western books for centuries .
this enti@@ cing visual language is determined by the dark man you should fear and the exotic woman you should be saved .
the ground@@ breaking Palestinian @-@ American scientist , Edward S@@ aid , de@@ fied the history behind these pictures in the 1970s .
but these pictures are prot@@ ru@@ ding even today .
our politicians , the news industry and Hollywood continue to perpet@@ u@@ ate them .
I have worked for thir@@ teen years in the news industry and I have seen how these powerful , flaw@@ ed sc@@ ars dominate our news@@ feeds .
this narrative is over@@ shad@@ owing the reality that in the last three decades nine Muslim women have led their countries , while the US could not even choose its first female presidential candidate in 2016 .
this narrative fails to acknowledge that when French , Muslim women are prevented from wearing their head@@ sc@@ arf in public buildings and forcing Saudi Arabian , Muslim women by their government to cover their entire body , these are both sides of the same coin .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a powerful group exercises his &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; control &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; other &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; .
this strong narrative weak@@ ens Muslim women who make movements for change .
it is also evident that the first Muslim prayers were spoken on American soil by Afri@@ cans who were hi@@ jack@@ ed with slave ships .
it del@@ etes the existence of qu@@ eer Muslims .
this narrative has filled our collective imagination so deeply and flaw@@ lessly , that often Si@@ kh men and children become the target of anti @-@ Muslim attacks and har@@ ass@@ ment .
because of these stories that we tell and because of the way in which we relate it , Islam@@ opho@@ bia is not just fear of Islam , religion , but fear of the &quot; other . &quot;
belonging to the 1.7 billion
in the news industry , we are dealing with more than just stories that are based on facts .
or on alternative facts .
we also create narr@@ atives that help us to understand the world .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and my industry has failed to capture the narrative of the 1.7 billion &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and we have failed here , where seven million Muslims constitute the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; diverse &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; religious group in America &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
more than a third of the entire Muslim population are African @-@ Americans .

four decades ago my immig@@ rant parents came to New York to live their American dream .
my mother laid her first jewelry design on 5th Avenue and my father worked hard in the sky@@ scra@@ pers of New York ; sky@@ scra@@ pers were made possible by the Muslim , American St@@ ati@@ ker from Bangladesh with the name Faz@@ l@@ ur Rah@@ man Khan .
back then , when Khan re@@ fi@@ gured out the sky@@ lines of the world , my parents were absolutely Muslims and Americans .
but am I now an ir@@ res@@ isti@@ ble Muslim and American woman ?
sometimes when people ask me why I don &apos;t eat pork , I say - instead of extrac@@ ting my Muslim recipes - or my handy hand@@ ker@@ chief , which all Muslims carry with them - &quot; out of respect for Pep@@ pa W@@ utz . &quot;
I j@@ ester , we don &apos;t carry all the pick@@ pockets with us .
we also don &apos;t have to be a the@@ ological expert in order to be a &quot; Muslim &quot; or to almost always be selected for additional security checks at the airport .
there are hundreds of outstanding Muslim scholars , Muslim activists and inter@@ religious activists who try to fight widespread lies about Islam .
these lies are produced on the ongoing band by a well @-@ forged Islam@@ ist skill machine with fin@@ ders , think tanks and experts for mis@@ information , who have manipul@@ ated our already faulty picture of what a Muslim is , or what Islam is .
because of the stories that we tell and because of the way in which we relate it , Islam@@ opho@@ bia is more than just a stranger , who tears the head@@ sc@@ arf out of a woman .

I would like to explain this .
I was born as a Muslim but to be a Muslim only then was born into my imagination when I was four years old , in a provisional mos@@ que in the basement of a pres@@ by@@ ter@@ ian church in New York .
when social scientists describe religious life , they refer back to the following terms : faith , behavior and affili@@ ation .
my Muslim faith and behaviour may not always be visible , but they are there .
perhaps my girlfriend , my neighbour , would see my rock in the surf that I am Muslims when they could look through the 15 meter concrete and air that separate our houses .
she would see the ritual of the evening with my daughter , if I held her in my arms and her Arabic verses to protect her who seal the Koran and called the Q@@ ul@@ s .
each of them I repeat three times .
I ask that they are protected from evil , the evil one can see and the evil one cannot see .
my Muslim faith may not always be visible , but my Muslim affili@@ ation is always part of my shadow .

belonging to her mother is the image of my mat@@ ernal grandmother with her sisters ; as they were winning a competition of the art of flower arrangement in Kar@@ achi for decades .
it is the image of her that I see at this moment when I close my eyes : nano , surrounded by their completed and un@@ finished paintings of the Su@@ fi Hei@@ liger ; and a Qur &apos;@@ an with many book@@ marks , a book with one hundred and fourteen chapters that it can almost mem@@ ori@@ ze .
being Muslim means to talk to the prayers that she told me when I have a bad day .
to be Muslims is how they taught me to refer to God : Allah Mi@@ an , what God means , my only Lord .
for a nation that has been col@@ oni@@ zed by a &quot; Imperi@@ um &quot; for centuries , a company founded by the name of Hon@@ orable Bri@@ tian Ost@@ ini@@ dia Company , it has a deep meaning to name God , my only Lord .

affili@@ ation is to know that there are millions of Kur@@ ds and Palestinians , whose families , like my grandfather , have been torn apart by col@@ oni@@ alists who have shared the Muslim world as at the game risk .
to be Muslims means to know that in the last two centuries , Europeans have been &quot; col@@ oni@@ zed &quot; all the way to four Muslim countries .
it means knowing that the first aerial bombar@@ d@@ ment of history was dropped over a Muslim country before a century ago .
it means knowing that at the same time the grandfather of my grandmother , an Indian , c@@ ash@@ mere sub@@ subject of the British empire , was referred to as &quot; dangerous &quot; by the newspapers of his time as he led the first mos@@ que in England .
even before there were planes , he travelled to more parts of the world than I ever was and preached the radical word of love , peace and social justice .

it means to remember that fourteen years ago , the most powerful military in the world , with troops scattered across each continent from the Antar@@ ctic , went to Iraq to pursue weapons of mass destruction that did not exist .
it means knowing that more than half a million Ira@@ q@@ is are buried under the ruins of the war .
being an American Muslim means knowing that the suicide rate among veter@@ ans has increased by more than 32 percent since 2001 .
it means knowing that if a tragedy visit the US and the suspect bears a Muslim name , the story is reported four times more than a story with a white assass@@ in .
it means knowing that fourteen hundred years ago the first cry of prayer , the Az@@ aan , was called Bil@@ al by a liber@@ ated black slave .
it means to know that , two hundred years ago , an African schol@@ ar named Bil@@ ali Muhammad was ens@@ la@@ ved and brought to this country .
it means nam@@ ing Mal@@ col@@ m X an American hero .
it is the warmth that I feel when people crowded the airports to fight against the Muslim B@@ an .
it is the hope that I feel when we stand up for our dreams and when we say black lives count .
being an American , a Pak@@ ist@@ an@@ erin , a K@@ ash@@ mir@@ i , a P@@ ah@@ ari , a Pun@@ j@@ ab@@ i , a Muslim and a journalist means the inherent inter@@ sec@@ tion@@ ality of our identi@@ ties with multiple under@@ lines , but to fail to communicate them to others .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the narrative of the 1.7 billion contains more possibilities than a sor@@ cer@@ ess , but is represented in the reducing doubt &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
to be a mother means to care for my child and all Muslim children , knowing that powerful and privileged people build structural anti @-@ Islam hos@@ tility on this fol@@ ly .
structural Islam@@ opho@@ bia is made up of Muslim regi@@ stra@@ r who began with President Bush and extended to President Obama .
it exists in continuous monitoring of mos@@ ques .
it consists of the immigration officer who occupies a five @-@ year @-@ old child in hand@@ cu@@ ffs .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a false and ne@@ bul@@ ous &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; No @-@ F@@ ly @-@ list &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which largely draws Arabs and Muslims . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these are the wars that we lead and the bombs we throw on Muslim lands . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
because of the stories that we tell and because of those we don &apos;t tell , we are here today .
in a study entitled A@@ scent of Man , scientists at the Nor@@ th@@ western University showed a scientifically wrong image and asked them to assess groups on a scale of 1 to 100 regarding evolution .
Muslims received the lowest score .
the conversation we have to lead
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are too deep to enth@@ use the Muslim or the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; other &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we are coming back decades to recognize the roots of our fears and the faulty and dangerous pic@@ torial forms that we ste@@ er in our news editors .
at least there is a growing movement led by American Muslims in the media industry trying to capture our multiple identi@@ ties and forgotten history .

but I am concerned about this difficult global timing in which we are located .
and this moment has consequences that go beyond the 1.7 billion .
there is one reason that conspiracy the@@ orists , who existed in the dark corners of the Internet , now lead the White House .
they have grown expon@@ enti@@ ally , because they have made Muslims to &quot; others . &quot;
there is another group that has grown expon@@ enti@@ ally by creating the &quot; other . &quot;
a few years before , they had not yet given them ; now they dominate large areas in Syria and Iraq .
I am concerned about the realities and the history I was not aware of when I was as old as it is now my daughter , but who today made me an ir@@ relevant Muslim .
things I have left here like a bread@@ cr@@ umb line in my speech .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; things that may awaken memories , for in all the inter@@ sections that constitute our humanity , a story may l@@ ur@@ k where someone is being made &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
right now , on the other side of the bridge in Berkeley , conversations are taking place as part of the 8th Annual Conference on Islam@@ opho@@ bia .

why do I tell this here at this TE@@ D@@ x Talk 2017 in Stan@@ ford , where , however , Edward S@@ aid , the man who showed us how wars are being w@@ aged and people have been enth@@ ron@@ ed by creating the &quot; other &quot; in public performance , four decades ago even scientist of Stan@@ ford was .
we have to ask ourselves uncomfortable questions about the role of being conscious and un@@ consciously the &quot; other &quot; ; as my girlfriend and I did in the rain during the Women &apos;s March , because the occupation that we have no president , the chocolate cake vom@@ it , while he already bombar@@ ded broken lands and &quot; to other made &quot; people goes far beyond the visible and invisible 1.7 billion .
it starts here with all of us .
initiative for narrative art wants to preserve urban language diversity
story@@ telling , by Fli@@ ck@@ r user Daniel@@ e Ros@@ si , using the license CC B@@ Y @-@ NC @-@ ND 2.0 .
can there be a way to contact someone here and now despite a language barrier ?
for Steven Bird and Rob@@ yn Per@@ ry , founder of the Treas@@ ure Language Stor@@ y@@ telling initiative ( T@@ LS ) , telling stories in their original language is a possible answer .
global Vo@@ ices reported recently about another initiative by Steven Bird , the conf@@ using blog .
here , however , the focus of T@@ LS is not on the written , but on the spoken word . it is an attempt to preserve and dig@@ ni@@ fy the language variety of large cities .
in fact , in urban areas such as Melbourne and Darwin in Australia or O@@ ak@@ land in the United States where T@@ LS has held events since 2015 , the risk that small and not so small languages are not passed on to the children born there .
the following applies to the makers of the project :
the mass mortality of the languages of the world can be avoided if we create cities that embrace diversity - secure spaces in which inhabitants do not have to forget who they are to belong .
while &quot; listening &quot; is often associated with &quot; understanding &quot; these events instead &quot; listening in order to appreciate , to feel , to establish . &quot;
in this format story@@ t@@ ellers first introduce their history in their own language and then translate or explain them in English .
even if the participants are not a professional story@@ t@@ eller , their devotion and their presentation lead to the fact that the audience can count on them .
they cry out laugh@@ ing and emotions as if the language is no longer a barrier .
the following video shows , for example , a traditional story from Burkina Faso , which is told in the language of D@@ af@@ ing . during this round , the story@@ t@@ eller R@@ assi@@ dat@@ ou con@@ ate takes the opportunity to explain the customs of narrative art typical for her country .
in another event John Ny@@ am@@ us tells us the f@@ able of the rab@@ bit and the b@@ abo@@ on in the Sh@@ ona language from Zimbabwe :
after explaining the importance of his ability , John Ny@@ am@@ us is asked : &quot; how is it to speak to an audience that doesn &apos;t understand your language ? &quot; with a wide gr@@ in he shares his sense of inclu@@ si@@ veness :
you have listened !
they were attentive ...
they were with me !
so far the events of Treas@@ ure Language Stor@@ y@@ telling have taken place in three cities , and organizers hope to extend this . all who are inspired by the project can contact T@@ LS to organize their own story@@ t@@ ellers .
Puerto Rico calls on the US to re@@ establish public debt
with the aim of a re @-@ examination of Puerto Rico &apos;s public debt , which rose to $ 72 million , various religious and civi@@ c organizations took part in a mass demonstration on April 3 , 2017 ; the march started with the Moroccan Cap@@ it@@ ol , the government building of the capital , and went up to the Plaza de Col@@ Ã³n in the old town of San Ju@@ ans .
it was proclaimed by the Fren@@ te Ci@@ u@@ dad@@ ano p@@ or la Audi@@ tor@@ Ã­a de la Deu@@ da ( civi@@ c front for the re @-@ examination of debts ) and the ec@@ umen@@ ical church meeting of Puerto Ri@@ cos .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the advoc@@ ates of re @-@ fixing the debt have also submitted a petition to the official homepage of the White House of the United States . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is their demand :
the people of Puerto Rico claim that politicians , bank@@ ers and government agencies responsible for debts are held accoun@@ table for their corruption .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we demand a financial audit and a Ste@@ ering Committee without any personal interest in public debt , with a fixed , our working conditions corresponding compensation , which acts in favor of the economy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we are black@@ ma@@ iled and supp@@ ressed .
the people of Puerto Rico refuse to pay a debt that is not theirs .
we will not choose between education and health .
our pen@@ sion@@ ers will not be reconc@@ iled with falling pension payments .
we demand immediate measures .
the island - not the sovereign territory of the United States - suffers from a severe financial crisis .
hence the so @-@ called &quot; Centre for New Economy , &quot; a non @-@ profit non @-@ profit organisation with no party affili@@ ation with a focus on socio @-@ economic development , is a law on state responsibility , as an alternative to the existing state view .
these are their reasons :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the economic and financial crisis of Puerto Ri@@ cos needs a long restructuring of the state infrastructure . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from the outside imposed measures are being je@@ op@@ ardi@@ zed without the participation and conviction of the citizens to be rejected by the people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the demonstration wore the name &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; night guard for light and truth . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

artist and writer pay tribute to the work of the missing Syrian designer Bass@@ el Saf@@ adi
Bass@@ el Saf@@ adi and his wife N@@ our@@ a .
photo from the Facebook page of N@@ our@@ a G@@ haz@@ i Saf@@ adi .
the Syrian @-@ Palestinian web developer Bass@@ el K@@ hart@@ ab@@ il , also known as Bass@@ el Saf@@ adi , has been missing for over a year .
but he is not forgotten .
more than five years after being arrested by the Syrian regime , his supporters and relatives continue the campaign for his freedom and recall the contributions he made for an open network .
at this year &apos;s re : publicity , the annual conference on the digital culture that is hosted in Berlin , an event dedicated to the # Free@@ Bass@@ el campaign was dedicated .
MÃ©@@ lan@@ ie D@@ ul@@ ong de Ros@@ n@@ ay , a scientist of the CN@@ RS Institute for Communication Sciences , and Barbara R@@ Ã¼h@@ ling , managing director at Book S@@ prints , produced books within three to five days , read extracts from the book Cost of Freedom : a Coll@@ ective In@@ qu@@ iry ( The cost of freedom : collective research ) .
the book , published last year and available here roy@@ alty @-@ free , contains a number of articles dealing with free culture in the face of oppression .
it &apos;s a tribute to Bass@@ el and his work .
in the introduction , it reads :
this book aims to discuss how motions for free knowledge are built up and what are the real costs associated with this .
activists , artists , designers , developers , researchers and authors who are involved in the movements for free knowledge have worked side @-@ by @-@ side to look beyond the fog that surrounds our news@@ feeds and to create some sense of our different experiences .
this book is an attempt to free Bass@@ el K@@ hart@@ ab@@ il , the beloved and celebrated Internet volunteer who has been det@@ ained in Syria since 15 March 2012 .
his name was removed from the list of the A@@ dra prison where he sat on 3 October 2015 .
since then , we have no information about his current status or location .
the introduc@@ tory part of his book with the title collective memory gives his friends and family a voice that push for his release and who want to know him back in his normal life and freedom , right away .
seeing how Bass@@ el pays a high price for his participation in a free culture has let many of us start thinking about their own dest@@ ini@@ es , actions and decisions .
why are we here today ?
what did we choose for ?
what have we given up in this process from time to time extreme beliefs ?
the web developer for open source and digital activ@@ ist has been in custody of Syrian government agencies since March 2012 .
in October 2015 , Bass@@ el was transferred from the A@@ dra prison , a non @-@ military institution , to an unknown location .
his wife , the writer and lawyer N@@ our@@ a G@@ haz@@ i , reported that the military police had taken Bass@@ el on the basis of a &quot; strictly secret &quot; command of the military court from his cell in A@@ dra . &quot;
G@@ haz@@ i reported that she had been contacted by persons who presented themselves as insi@@ ders of the Assad government and made aware of an alleged death sentence against her husband on 12 November 2015 .
however , his place of residence and state remains unknown .
a pioneer of the Creative Com@@ mons in Syria and actively involved in projects such as Mozilla Firefox and Wikipedia , Bass@@ el played a crucial role in expanding access to the Internet and knowledge for the public in Syria .
Barry Th@@ re@@ w , a designer , techn@@ ologist and currently the director of New Pal@@ my@@ ra , a project that Bass@@ el founded , writes on pages 10 and 11 of the book :
perhaps nobody of Bas@@ le &apos;s cultural prototypes was more for@@ esi@@ ghted than the work he began with a group of archae@@ ologists and 3D artists around 2005 to virtually re@@ construct the ancient ruins of Pal@@ my@@ ra .
Pal@@ my@@ ra , one of the most important archaeological sites in the world , was the cross@@ roads of numerous civi@@ liz@@ ations , and here Greek @-@ Roman architecture mel@@ ts with local traditions and Persian influence .
at that time , Bass@@ el did not know that ten years after he began working with this work , the IS would do everything possible to wipe out the architecture that em@@ bodies not only the cultural heritage of Syria but the world .
this expedition into digital archae@@ ology and conservation has created a time capsule that will be inv@@ alu@@ able for the public as well as for scientists and artists in the future .
tra@@ gically , Bass@@ el couldn &apos;t finish this project until now .
N@@ our@@ a G@@ haz@@ i has also contributed to the book and writes about her husband &apos;s passion to share his knowledge with others , even during his time in prison :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I spent my whole life dream of freedom and Bass@@ el taught me to embrace her . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I am overwhel@@ med when I call his name .
Bass@@ el taught me English even when he was in jail .
I learned to read , write and speak English well .
he has always shared his knowledge with anyone who has asked . he has taught other prisoners to read , write and speak English .
Bass@@ el opened the door to technology . he taught me to use both computers and smartphones .
he brought me the internet .
he also taught other prisoners , how they use computers , at least theoretically , without actually holding one in their hands .
G@@ haz@@ i is also the author of Wa@@ iting ( Wa@@ iting ) , a commission that she wrote to her husband in the years 2012 to 2015 when he was in detention .
Bass@@ el and N@@ our@@ a worked together on the book for a year .
she smu@@ g@@ gled the lyrics to him when she visited him and he translated it from Arabic into English .
the book is available roy@@ alty @-@ free .
book envelope by Y@@ ous@@ se@@ f Ab@@ dal@@ ki .
the book is dedicated to the public domain .
here is an excer@@ pt from the book of Nor@@ a with the title &quot; It is happening &quot; :
it happens every time you visit ,
that I sink in the world of your enchanting eyes ,
that I lose the mood in the moment in which we embrace ,
that each of the dangers doesn &apos;t matter to me ,
each of the f@@ ences , sh@@ ac@@ kles and guards
I forget the cr@@ ush of the prison
and I will enter into every detail of your voice and your words ;
which I carry with passion with me ,
when your eyes say good@@ bye
and I will leave another piece of my soul with you ...
I quickly return to my lon@@ el@@ iness ,
to get back all the moments ,
and to we@@ ep and smile about your absence .
I convince myself that I will return soon ...
on the first anniversary of the imprisonment of Bass@@ el , G@@ haz@@ i wrote :
one year passes , my soul
during the day
I am in your cage ,
and you &apos;re still in the cage of monsters
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the story is not unique in Syria . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
since the beginning of the protests against Bash@@ ar al @-@ Assad &apos;s regime in 2011 , more than 65@@ ,000 people have disappeared , according to the Syrian Network for Human Rights ( Syrian Network for Human Rights ) .
those who were arrested or disappeared under the regime of violence were tor@@ tured or even executed .
by 2016 , at least 17,@@ 7@@ 23 Syrians have died in jail since 2011 according to the international human rights organisation Am@@ nesty International .
the stories of many other people remain unknown .
the Global Vo@@ ices community has been calling for the release of Bass@@ el since 2012 .
today we reiter@@ ate our demand in the hope that we have to do this last time .
Moz@@ ambique : post @-@ release Director , convic@@ ted of corruption , again on previous post
Moz@@ ambique re@@ acted with anger on a corruption case , in which a member of the government returned to work in the state apparatus after half of his imprisonment in which corruption was committed .
it is Di@@ od@@ ino Cam@@ ba@@ za , who was arrested in 2008 and was sentenced to 22 years in prison together with four other defend@@ ants on account of mis@@ appropri@@ ation of 54 million Me@@ tik@@ al ( approximately 800@@ ,000 euros ) .
the money came from public funds from Moz@@ ambique airport , whose Council presi@@ ded over Cam@@ ba@@ za between 2005 and 2008 .
Cam@@ ba@@ za was released in 2016 for good management and immediately called for his re @-@ adjustment to the company , which happened on 19 April .
in accordance with a statement by the At@@ tor@@ ney General of the Republic , which rejected the application , there would be no barrier for Cam@@ ba@@ za to resume his old posts because the company did not perform any disciplinary proceedings after his detention .
however , many inhabitants do not mean that the action is good .
in an interview with Deutsche Welle , the Centre for Public Integr@@ ity ( Centro de Integ@@ ri@@ da@@ de P@@ Ãº@@ b@@ lica , C@@ IP ) , a local institution dedicated to public transparency , condemned the company &apos;s decision to re @-@ establish the director :
represents a set@@ back in the fight against corruption and exemp@@ li@@ fies the lack of transparency and is even a reg@@ ression with regard to the efforts of our legal system , such as the C@@ IP .
what we take note of is that the company should have introduced a disciplinary procedure against the offen@@ ders .
the company , however , apparently kept silent and did not cause any reasonable legal steps to apply the appropriate functions .
Eg@@ Ã­@@ dio V@@ az , an important voice in the Muslim social media , also re@@ jects this behaviour and considers the case as &quot; re@@ fut@@ able &quot; :
if Cam@@ ba@@ za was a competent guy , he would be a consultant after he was sentenced to jail and half of which had been su@@ ed .
he could keep paid lectures and motiv@@ ating speeches , he could deliber@@ ate and polish his image .
but since he is in@@ competent , he has cons@@ ented to be re@@ integrated into the company he helped to inflic@@ t harm .
therefore it is obvious : Cam@@ ba@@ za is liked to be paid for his silence .
contradictory !
Bit@@ one Vi@@ age , young Moz@@ ambique and student of political science in Brazil says that the director does not have any moral :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Cam@@ ba@@ za rewards the state because he insul@@ ted him . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I cannot believe that you are rewarded in such a way that the state has already so massi@@ vely insul@@ ted the state . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Cam@@ ba@@ za lacks the return of morality and serves the state , * he had already had a unique opportunity to serve the state , but instead only served himself on the state .
Cam@@ ba@@ za used the state to act as an in@@ exhaus@@ tible source of money and the state itself became tired of this man who was charged and finally sentenced to a long prison term .
hon@@ estly , I don &apos;t know why this man was rewarded in such a way .
Franc@@ ey Ze@@ Ãº@@ te pre@@ fers the Prime Minister of Moz@@ ambique , Sam@@ ora Mach@@ el , to remind that a th@@ ief is in jail :
thi@@ eves belong to the Pr@@ ison Sam@@ ora Mach@@ el and will not only be remembered for ever as the first independent president but also as a sharp , inc@@ isi@@ ve and - by the way - proph@@ etic or@@ ator .
one of his most famous oral representations was when he vigor@@ ously confirmed that &quot; an ambitious man is capable of selling his own individual interest , even the father@@ land for his ambi@@ tions , his own individual interest . &quot;
Sam@@ ora also said : &quot; I don &apos;t know if an ambitious man changes , my experience shows that it is not so . he changes the tactics , but he does not turn away from his ambi@@ tions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; an ambitious man is at the same time criminal . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in Twitter the reactions were also negative :
Cam@@ ba@@ za was sentenced to 22 years in prison , he was 10 years old and free .
and today the company , in which he rep@@ lies funds , res@@ umes it again under contract . # As@@ sig@@ V@@ ai@@ O@@ M@@ eu@@ Pa@@ is - eg@@ . Î±@@ Femin@@ isti@@ anity ( @ az@@ mal _ Ra@@ fik ) , May 12 , 2017

Facebook blocks the rac@@ ist word &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; in Myanmar and cens@@ ored many users
the Bur@@ m@@ ese word &quot; Kal@@ ar pa@@ e &quot; means chi@@ ck@@ pe@@ as or sp@@ ig@@ old .
photo of San@@ j@@ ay A@@ char@@ ya , Wikipedia Com@@ mons , Creative Com@@ mons Attri@@ bution @-@ Share A@@ like 3.0 Un@@ ported
according to information from Facebook users in Myanmar , the well @-@ known social network took their posts from the network because they contained the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; .
although the origin of the word is still discussed , it is usually used to refer to people of East Indian origin or generally used as adj@@ ective &quot; Indian . &quot;
Facebook cens@@ uses the word &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; or &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Burma &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as part of an initiative to address the widespread problem of hate speech in Burma in the social network . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in recent years , the rise of radical nation@@ alist movements has given the word an extremely depreci@@ ating con@@ notation .
in particular , it is a word that is mostly used by ultra @-@ nation@@ alists as hate speech against Muslims representing a minority of the population in Myanmar .
but in an effort to combat hate speech in Myanmar , the company has cens@@ ored a lot of meaningful content on its platform .
&apos;@@ Kal@@ ar &apos; may normally be associated with rac@@ ism , but the word itself does not automatically ev@@ oke hate speech .
the context is important &amp; # 8@@ 212 ; many people have reported that posts where they have discussed the use of the word have been cens@@ ored for its use .
in addition , there are several Bur@@ m@@ ese words with basic mean@@ ings that have the same sequence as &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; .
for example , it is written on Bur@@ m@@ ese also called &apos; Kal@@ ar h@@ ta@@ ing &apos; , which contains the same letters as well as other words like &apos; Kal@@ ar pa@@ e &apos; , &apos; Kal@@ ar O@@ AT &apos; ( cam@@ el ) or &apos; kal@@ en@@ aar &apos; ( curtain ) .
the Fac@@ eb@@ oo@@ kn@@ utz@@ er A@@ ung Ka@@ ung My@@ at explained the different mean@@ ings of words with the sound of &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; so :
a post from one of my friends was deleted today because he contained the word Kal@@ ar .
however , he asked his friends in a wit@@ ty way if they knew how to ease his back pain by making a play of words .
the sentence ku la - &quot; healing &quot; ( ku ) + the question word ( la ) on Bur@@ m@@ ese - resembles the rac@@ ist expression , but the context is completely different .
there were various reactions to the Facebook initiative .
Z@@ in Win H@@ tet believes that it will reduce hate speech radical nation@@ alists , but also stressed that Facebook must be more analy@@ tic before releasing all the posts that were suspected of spreading rac@@ ism .
Facebook does not delete the word &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; manually .
it filters the word automatically .
automati@@ sm will not understand what you are writing to Fac@@ e@@ ook .
what you should do instead is to carefully analyze the post and check it by checking the following words .
for example , &quot; Kal@@ ar H@@ t@@ ine &quot; ( chair ) and &quot; Kal@@ ar pa@@ e &quot; ( spl@@ itting balls ) .
the good thing is that these dirty nation@@ alists who spread hate speech receive a fairly good lesson .
now it is time to circumc@@ ise their nation@@ alism .
while the action may send a strong signal to anyone who is spreading hate speech , the efficiency of this strategy may not last long .
the experiences of social networks in China such as S@@ ina Wei@@ bo and We@@ Chat proved that the cens@@ orship of keywords is often a cat and mouse game , whereby the users of social networks can simply start using a new word or alternative sp@@ elling of the cens@@ ored word to express their views .
the author A@@ ung Ka@@ ung My@@ at described how Facebook started to delete his posts when he wanted to tell his friends that the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; is ban@@ ished from the social network :
... when I became aware of this new Facebook policy , I made a post to tell my Facebook friends that the word is locked .
iron@@ ically , my post was removed from Facebook and I was not allowed to use the Li@@ ken , post , and share content for 24 hours because the mail &quot; did not meet the Facebook community standards . &quot;
Facebook has removed a multitude of posts from people who have no negative intentions or who simply try to show their opinions against the hate speech of radical nation@@ alists .
Patrick Mur@@ phy wrote that his post was removed , which has nothing to do with hate speech :
post without hate speech from Facebook .
in the post , the author expressed his opinion on why extreme nation@@ alism and religious fundament@@ alism in the country are bad .
Ch@@ an My@@ ae Kh@@ ine believes Facebook should have done more before the start of the initiative , for example the Bur@@ m@@ ese Internet community to ask for advice :
Facebook likes to have a ben@@ evol@@ ent intention to reduce rac@@ ism in Burma through its platform , but it does not work .
cens@@ oring such words will only bring more hatred within the various communities .
in addition , it seems as if they have started this without local context or technical support and have forbidden such words as &quot; stool &quot; or &quot; pe@@ a cur@@ ry . &quot;
even when they found out that they made mistakes , they did not try to correct the fal@@ sely deleted posts .
if they had just a little more respect for the 15 million benefits that would give them a big turnover , that would be great .
Fac@@ ebooks automatic cens@@ orship has caused a lot of ri@@ dic@@ ule among users .
instead of taking it seriously , users now make fun of Facebook and consciously write the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; in the context of hate speech to see if their posts are taken from the network .
here you can see some screen@@ shots of Facebook posts containing no hate speech , but still removed :
used with permission .
the Bur@@ m@@ ese text reads : &quot; I want to sit on a chair and eat pe@@ as cur@@ ry and watch an Indian film .
just to check if Facebook removes the mail containing the word Kal@@ ar . &quot;
screen@@ shot used with permission .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the post says &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; If you are a doctor , do you heal people ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
screen@@ shot used with permission .
over the past five years , extreme nation@@ alist ide@@ ologies and religious fundament@@ alists have used social networks to expand their voices and influence .
among other things , hate speech in social networks should also heat the violence in the communities in Myanmar , especially in the area of Rak@@ h@@ ine where disputes between Muslims and Budd@@ hi@@ sts forced thousands to flee .
Facebook was critici@@ zed for his failure to bring out the ex@@ hil@@ ar@@ ating hate speech on his Bur@@ m@@ ese pages .
but instead of simply cens@@ oring the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; , it would have been better to look at the context than on code concentrating initiatives and learned from them .
in Trinidad &amp; # 0@@ 38 ; Tob@@ ago is an end to the children &apos;s marriage
a wedding ring in the sand .

the children &apos;s marriage is now illegal in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago .
on 9 June 2017 , the parliament of the country unanim@@ ously approved a law bann@@ ing this practice , so that the hom@@ ici@@ able age is now at 18 .
before this change of the marriage network , some members of Hind@@ u and Muslim religious communities stuck to practice , and in May 2016 there was a large public scre@@ am . at that time , Brother Har@@ ry@@ per@@ sad Mahar@@ aj , a group of representatives of the various religious groups of the country , said that the state should not interfere since that , age does not determine maturity . &quot;
despite the fact that Trinidad and Tob@@ ago is a contractual partner of the UN Convention on Children &apos;s Rights , the min@@ ors are defined as &quot; every man under 18 years of age . &quot;
UN statistics for the years 2002 @-@ 2012 show that the proportion of children who were married to 15 was 2.8 percent in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago , and with 18 it was 8.1 percent .
in 2011 , the Federal Statisti@@ cal Office of the country confirmed that more than 8@@ 400 girls and 1300 boys were married at 19 in 1997 @-@ 2007 .
online peti@@ tions and social media movements seeking to abol@@ ish laws on inf@@ ancy , followed at the foot and enjoyed great support . undoubtedly , they helped bring about this result .
nevertheless , not everything went smoothly .
a Hind@@ u leader , for example , had no hes@@ itation to tell the critics of the children &apos;s marriage , they should , condem@@ ning themselves to take care of their own affairs . &quot;
this kind of religious opposition caused tensions in this really un@@ complicated matter , and at some point there were doubts as to whether the opposition would agree to the draft bill .
but at the beginning of 2017 , the bill was decided against the children &apos;s marriage - despite the four sen@@ ators ( among them a woman ) of the opposition and an independent one , so that he could be discussed in the House of Repres@@ ent@@ atives , where a simple majority would already make him a law .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now only the president of the country must agree and proclaim the law . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
one of the Sen@@ ators of the country gave a status update on Facebook , which Les@@ lie @-@ An@@ n Bo@@ is@@ elle re@@ posted on Inst@@ agra@@ m :
Mr. Sen@@ ator Clar@@ ence Ram@@ b@@ har@@ at : the bill against the children &apos;s marriage was voted in the House of Repres@@ ent@@ atives with 35 votes and not one against it .
after having previously decided in the Senate , the draft can now become a law .
the majority of social media users were thri@@ lled , because the laws on inf@@ ancy had finally been changed .
Lov@@ ell Francis , a Facebook member of the Ministry of Education , said :
it took too much time and unnecessary talk that disgu@@ ised the heart of the matter , but do you know what ? the inf@@ ancy is now illegal in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago , and that &apos;s worth almost any price .
while Abel Jackson was of the opinion , it definitely took long enough to abol@@ ish the practice , L@@ ara Qu@@ entr@@ all @-@ Thomas was over@@ jo@@ yed that the day had finally arrived :
public status update on Facebook by L@@ ara Qu@@ entr@@ ali - Thomas , which states : &apos; , Excell@@ ent news !
the network has been decided .
minimum age - 18 , voices - 35 for it - 0 against it ! ! ! ! &quot;
Fol@@ ade Mut@@ ota , which belongs to the Women &apos;s Institute for Alternative Development ( WI@@ NA@@ D ) , is a civil society group that talks quite openly about how important the adoption of the law was :
the age of marriage in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago is now independent of the religious affili@@ ation of 18 years .
the amend@@ ment of the marriage network was decided today , on June 9 , 2017 .
there are 41 de@@ pu@@ ties in the House of Repres@@ ent@@ atives and 35 of them were present at the vote .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all members who were admitted have voted for the law . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the children &apos;s marriage in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago is no longer permitted by law .
it was a long battle ( ... ) # tur@@ bi@@ os@@ hil@@ d@@ abuse .
many thanks to all activists who challenged him .
congratulations .
a thank you to our MEPs .
however , a possible catch comes in the form of Sat Mahar@@ aj , the Secretary General of San@@ atan D@@ har@@ ma Mah@@ a Sab@@ ha , the most well @-@ known Hind@@ u organization of the country .
months ago Mahar@@ aj has announced his intention to take judicial steps , the law should be passed , and he seems to redeem his promise .
while the At@@ tor@@ ney General Paris Al ra@@ wi , a pro@@ pon@@ ent of the law , said that it was quite legitimate if Mahar@@ aj wanted to go against the law , most social media users wished to address the debate on the subject differently .
Patricia Wor@@ rel@@ l proposed :
dear Sat , if we , instead of discussing the discussion as general , in a way that can only cause panic and dis@@ grace , if we say that the state , our daughters guard against it , that it might be ab@@ used by large , hard @-@ boiled men who are in favor of them , &quot; would you then be prepared to continue the discussion ?
or do you think it &apos;s not a problem ?
however , whether it comes to a legal action against the law or not , this legislation is an important step - however , there are still places in the world where children are legally or still the norm in different grades , even though there are laws that prohi@@ bit them .

on Sunday , the Office of the Prosecutor announced the local news service Y@@ ar@@ news that they were h@@ ack@@ ed .
by mirr@@ oring websites , Turkish users can view Wikipedia content again
the Wikipedia page was published on January 18 , 2012 , contrary to the SO@@ PA ( Stop Online Privacy Act ) and P@@ IP@@ A copyright legislation in the United States , internationally dark@@ ened .
created by Wikipedia ( CC B@@ Y @-@ SA 3.0 )
Turkey has been blocking the popular and crow@@ d@@ sourcing principle based en@@ cyclo@@ pedia Wikipedia for over a month .
day after day it becomes clear how important the platform is for users to find and share useful and reliable information .
both students and repor@@ ters and fans of TV series defend themselves against the blocking .
although many tech @-@ sav@@ vy Internet users are used to using forming tools for blocked websites ( a recent article by the New York Times reports that Turkey has the third largest VPN pre@@ val@@ ence in the world ) , most common Wikipedia users do not fall into this category .
although Turkey has blocked articles from Wikipedia , as recently published in a published report by the Ber@@ k@@ man Klein Center for Internet &amp; amp ; Society at Harvard University , regular block@@ ings of the Internet have been held since 2007 after the internet law ( No. 56@@ 51 ) was adopted .
after China , Turkey is the second most famous country in the world when it comes to the massive cens@@ orship of Wikipedia .
while the platform continues to remain locked , several mirrors ( pages that mirror the content of Wikipedia and are frequently updated ) are now di@@ pped .
a solution came from IP@@ FS ( the Inter@@ Plan@@ etary File System ) , when the platform placed all Turkish Wikipedia pages on its decentr@@ alized pe@@ er @-@ to @-@ pe@@ er network ( i.e. computer calcul@@ ators ) , which does not rely on the system of domain names and thus makes a complete cens@@ orship difficult .
however , the content is available in spite of legal prohibition .
in a blog post , IP@@ FS reports about his efforts :
after we &apos;ve heard the news ( about the block from Wikipedia ) , we put everything in place to take snap@@ shots from Wikipedia on the IP@@ FS platform . thus , it is possible to read the contents in a decentr@@ alized and distributed manner .
this can help users view at least all Wikipedia content even if they cannot reach the website www.@@ wi@@ ki@@ pedi@@ a.@@ org .
IP@@ FS also stated that this step was done independently of the Wi@@ k@@ im@@ edia Foundation , and it is only screen@@ shots and no live or dynamic versions of the website .
however , Wi@@ k@@ im@@ edia was involved in other efforts to circum@@ vent the lock .
Cr@@ isti@@ an Con@@ son@@ ni from Wi@@ k@@ im@@ edia Italy has both tr@@ .@@ vi@@ ki@@ an@@ si@@ klo@@ pedi@@ .org , a M@@ irr@@ or@@ page from Wikipedia , as well as Wiki@@ Mir@@ ror , an open source project that everyone can use to host similar mirrors when locked in the respective country Wikipedia .
Con@@ son@@ ni reported Sub@@ h@@ ash@@ ish Pan@@ ig@@ rah@@ i - Global Vo@@ ices member and staff at Mozilla in the Pan@@ ig@@ rah@@ i &apos;s Open Spe@@ aks &quot; pod@@ cast :
it is not a complete copy of a proxy address , a mirror .
you access another URL that is not the original . that what you see is from Wikipedia .
essentially , the server runs the request to the right Wikipedia page , so it is possible to see the contents of Wikipedia yourself when they are locked in Turkey .
this is done by a server that is not in Turkey .
a Nep@@ al@@ ese wildlife photographer uses his camera to draw attention to the need for nature conservation
a moving r@@ hin@@ o , ch@@ it@@ wan .
photo by Sag@@ ar Gir@@ i .
used with permission .
Sag@@ ar Gir@@ i was never satisfied with the photos he saw around him . they were blur@@ ry with poorly positioned motives and washed colours .
this motivated him to take a camera and try to strai@@ gh@@ ten the situation .
at that time he was still a child .
today , at the age of 28 , Sag@@ ar tries to bring N@@ ept@@ une to the international stage .
and his hom@@ etown , right next to Ch@@ it@@ wan National Park , offers him the perfect opportunity to take photographs that draw attention to N@@ ept@@ une &apos;s wildlife .
he described on Facebook how this first @-@ class location helps him in his work :
I live at the edge of Ch@@ it@@ wan National Park , a world natural heritage . what could be better for a passionate wildlife photographer ! !
I rested just at home when I suddenly called myself Navar@@ aj ( the manager of Ch@@ it@@ wan G@@ aida Lodge ) . he had received a call from my father that a le@@ op@@ ard would be le@@ op@@ ard on the banks of the Rap@@ ti river .
the river is only a few minutes away from the tourist town of Sau@@ ra@@ ha .
immediately I ran off with my camera and was there in a few minutes .
my father watched him and showed me the place on the other side of the river , where the le@@ op@@ ard was located and I immediately started to gn@@ ash pictures ! !
Sag@@ ar seeks cooperation with the authorities to obtain global recognition for Nepal and wants to deep@@ en the understanding that wild animals are not as frigh@@ tening as they look like .
and he should know &#91; it &#93; , for he stood before Tig@@ ers face to face ,
a tiger is not disturbed by the opinion of the sheep during sleep ! !
late in the evening . the light is too weak .
sleeping time for all animals and birds .
also I was on the way home because of the darkness , when the king of the boy suddenly appeared . he sat down immediately , we look at him and he star@@ es me through the sc@@ arf @-@ trees ! !
to promote the protection of wild animals Sag@@ ar places the logo &quot; I click for saffron &quot; ( lit . : I click for protection of the environment ) on his photos .
his passion for the promotion of Nep@@ al@@ ese nature and wildlife is not always easy .
he waited for 22 days and mostly lived in a tent to take pictures of Ot@@ tern in the Bar@@ dia National Park . up to 12 days it took until he could photograph a tiger and six to seven days for the perfect photo of birds living near the tourist accommodation .
see below some of these photos below .

years after the wedding Indian women dare to pron@@ ounce the names of their hus@@ bands for the first time
women in the small Indian village Gum@@ la J@@ am Gay@@ i in Jh@@ ark@@ hand .

this entry was written by Kay@@ on@@ a@@ az K@@ aly@@ an@@ wal@@ a and was originally published on video vol@@ un@@ te@@ ers , an award @-@ winning international community media organization from India .
a revised version has been re@@ published here as part of a content sharing agreement .
in many parts of India , women with the greatest care should avoid the names of their hus@@ bands or even older men in the family .
instead they use a pron@@ o@@ uns or say &quot; father of my child . &quot;
from Ch@@ hat@@ tis@@ gar@@ h to Mahar@@ ash@@ tra and U@@ t@@ tar Pra@@ des@@ h women admit that they respect husband because of social pressure , as well as fear of the consequences , they should desp@@ ise the norm , keep this practice alive .
last year , Mal@@ ati Mah@@ at@@ oto was convic@@ ted of the Indian State of O@@ dish@@ a by a fake court and rejected by her family and the village community after having addressed a married couple with names .
the tradition of nam@@ ing their wives as well is also common among men . however , they have far fewer grants to fear , if at all , they should not follow this practice .
in the small village of Wal@@ he in P@@ une , in Mahar@@ ash@@ tra , nine women , including health personnel and house@@ wives , joined a unique club and became the main topic of discussion in the city .
it is a place only for them to discuss and discuss the intri@@ c@@ acies of the patri@@ archy .
as one of the 56 clubs that exist in 13 Indian states , it is part of the campaign # K@@ hel@@ Bad@@ al that is operated by the Community of Video Vol@@ un@@ te@@ ers and advoc@@ ates the disman@@ tling of the Patri@@ arch@@ ate .
Roh@@ ini Pa@@ was has been working for seven years with the help of her video camera to detect practices such as child marriage , exile of HIV and AIDS @-@ infected individuals , and manages these clubs .
it reports how these clubs created a safe place for these women and at the same time made them amb@@ ass@@ adors of change .
the first video that Roh@@ ini showed in her discussion group was of women who did not call her hus@@ bands by name .
she chose this topic because she wanted to open up the discussion about the patri@@ archy with a problem with which the women can easily identify .
not to speak lou@@ dly to the name of their hus@@ bands is a custom that they all have du@@ ti@@ fully uph@@ eld and never questioned .
Roh@@ ini means :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this tradition testi@@ fies that a woman respects her husband and wishes him a long life . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a woman who does not consider this will be considered dec@@ eit@@ ful as a woman without morality .
the tradition is so deeply rooted that we have never thought about it until this discussion round .
at the beginning , Roh@@ ini , who had never called her husband so far , wanted to try at home , as it is .
she showed the video of the discussion round her husband and her mother @-@ in @-@ law .
Roh@@ ini nar@@ rates :
my mother @-@ in @-@ law and my husband remained silent for a long time after the video ended .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Prak@@ ash , my husband , turned to me and said I should call him from now on his name . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
with this self @-@ confidence in luggage , Roh@@ ini started her first discussion club .
many women had never heard the word &quot; patri@@ archy &quot; before . some believed that it was a good thing because it meant that the younger members of a family , especially girls and women , were protected .
at the beginning of the round , Roh@@ ini showed a video about the problem in U@@ t@@ tar Pra@@ des@@ h .
after the video projection , the women tried to get the discussion underway .
Roh@@ ini invited every participant to say the name of her husband with different feelings - happy , angry , sad , loving and so on .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; then she asked all , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; If we can &apos;t say the name of our hus@@ bands , but they can call us as they want , does that mean they don &apos;t respect us ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; should it not be equivalent ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; some of these women have been married for 30 years and this was the first day they brought the name of their hus@@ bands over their lips , &quot; says Roh@@ ini Pa@@ ine from the village of Wal@@ he in Mahar@@ ash@@ tra on the crush@@ ing of a centuries @-@ old tradition in which married women could never speak the name of their hus@@ bands .
Roh@@ ini nar@@ rates :
a woman was so shy that she was hiding only in front of herself during the whole exercise ; another decided to release the whole of his fru@@ stration against him and his family by cur@@ sing him .
the expression on their faces was ec@@ static .
I think I &apos;ll never forget it again .
still in the rush of adren@@ aline , having broken with an ancient custom , the women decided they would actually try to name their hus@@ bands by name .
and they kept their word .
in the next few days Roh@@ ini received a variety of reports .
the husband of a woman called Roh@@ ini and asked what ideas she put into the head of women : his wife could not stop telling his name .
another club member decided to do it at dinner before the whole family .
when her mother @-@ in @-@ law star@@ ed her , she was afraid and said it was a mistake .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; another woman said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Roh@@ ini said I should do it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a member of a participant was less understanding and the situation was in force .
Roh@@ ini reports how women have tried to stop other practices , such as wearing the zin@@ no@@ ber@@ red dot on the forehead that indicates the mar@@ ital status :
why do women only have to show that they are married ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I said to my husband that I would wear the zinc red dot if he did . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he only laugh@@ ed and I stopped wearing him .
the other women have not completely stopped doing so , but they think they are now in a better position to choose not to wear it on some days .
for many women , the disc@@ us club is a safe place where they can exchange their opinions and objectives .
&quot; at each discussion club we make an excursion .
normally we pack lunch and water and go out into the field .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t want women to make sure who could hear what could hear , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for the first time in the last months they celebrated their own birth@@ days in their life with cakes ; they d@@ anced and sang and talked about things they had never thought before .
Roh@@ ini says :
I have been working on these problems for so many years and yet I have never been so honest about some things , for example how our identi@@ ties are linked to our hus@@ bands .
it feels great to say certain things loud , no matter how small they occur .
in a discussion round , we talked about the concept of honor and how it is associated with clothes .
some women in the group have only carried sar@@ is since their marriage .
for most of them this is okay , but some wanted to wear a Sal@@ man @-@ Kur@@ ta , a wide shirt over a pants , they have not dar@@ ed .
after a lot of arguments and discussion about the advantages of their own choice of clothes , morality associated with the Sar@@ is and much more , Roh@@ ini smu@@ g@@ gled her own couple of Kur@@ tas ( Ober@@ hem@@ den ) into a discussion round so that the women could wear them .
next , they decided to plan a trip to Go@@ a , where they can wear jeans and Roh@@ ini is sure they &apos;ll manage it .
on the question of whether things have changed in the five months since their first discussion club , Roh@@ ini confirms that things are slowly getting rolling :
so far we have done only small steps .
some women tried it a few times , but then stopped to tell her husband &apos;s name .
some , including myself , do it , but only if they are alone and no other family members are there .
only one or two women continue to say the name of their hus@@ bands ; only one or two women now wear Zin@@ no@@ ber@@ rot on their foreh@@ e@@ ads at any time .
the women in the discussion club know that the changes they want to achieve in their lives - like hag@@ gling for more freedom of movement or their own choice - at the end of a difficult to navigate river .
by giving each other self @-@ confidence , they become aware that they are sitting in the same boat .
how Roh@@ ini explains :
each of us is a victim of the patri@@ archy .
I am also .
but this club gives each of us the confidence that something will change .
and I know that it is not limited to 30 families . there will be a chain reaction when every woman walks home in the club and tells other people about what we are talking about and what we are doing .
we all sit in the same boat .

the visit of the Beat@@ les in 1966 in Japan is regarded as a turning point in the Japanese culture of the post @-@ war era .
the first Japanese journalist , Hos@@ hi@@ ka Rum@@ i@@ ko , who exclusively inter@@ viewed the Beat@@ les 1964 in London , noted in 2016 on the occasion of the 50@@ th anniversary of the first visit :
for just barely five days , the Beat@@ les were in the country , but this was enough to let the Japanese go through .
the people here have become quite quickly clear that they had no choice but to receive the Beat@@ les with open arms .
many famous Japanese sizes had reached their zen@@ ith when the Beat@@ les came to Japan for the first time in 1966 .
the music of the cult band is &quot; more than just a universal language like English , &quot; Ry@@ u@@ ich@@ i Is@@ aka , President of the retailer Seven &amp; amp ; i Hol@@ dings , the online magazine Nik@@ k@@ ei Asian Review .
good morning ! - Today the Beat@@ les Memorial Day is in Japan . for the last 51 years it was here in Tokyo .

and as it is for fans , Japanese of course also make pilgri@@ ma@@ ges to the well @-@ known places connected with the band .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you love the Beat@@ les , these are your 5 places that you absolutely need to visit . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

bald men are ab@@ duc@@ ted and killed in Moz@@ ambique
the police of Z@@ amb@@ Ã©@@ zia warned the population that bald men could be the target of attacks in Moz@@ ambique .

a new system of kidn@@ apping of bald people for organ traffi@@ cking , presumably for dis@@ believing purposes , dis@@ solves the police of Z@@ amb@@ Ã©@@ zia , a province in Moz@@ ambique . the local government now called for a number of operations to stop the practice .
at the beginning of the month , three men were killed in the district of Mil@@ k , a few kilometers from the border to Malawi .
one of the victims was found de@@ capit@@ ated and a part of the organs were taken .
two men were arrested and subsequently they conf@@ essed that the organs of sham@@ ans were used in Tanzania and Malawi .
there is the local super@@ sti@@ tion that the head of a bald man could contain gold or bring wealth , said the police spokes@@ man of Z@@ amb@@ Ã©@@ zia of the BBC .
it is the first time that successive attacks on bald men were registered in Moz@@ ambique .
another group , the goal of mur@@ ders for obsc@@ ure purposes , are people with Al@@ bin@@ ism .
this meant that the UN 2016 in the South African country led a mission to investigate this practice .
the persecution of people with Al@@ bin@@ ism is common in other countries of southern Africa , especially in neighbouring Tanzania , where the government developed campaigns to fight these super@@ sti@@ tions and prejudi@@ ces .
U@@ kom@@ be We@@ ya lives in the city of Map@@ u@@ to .
he warned those who intend to travel to the country :
attention to bald men who travel to Moz@@ ambique are the target of ritu@@ alistic attacks , the Moz@@ ambi@@ can police warned of the latest kill@@ ings of three bald men because of their body parts .
two susp@@ ects were arrested in the district of Mil@@ ange , where the kill@@ ings took place .
Hus@@ sen@@ e Al@@ gy Adam@@ o , student and resident of the city of In@@ ham@@ ban@@ e in the south of Moz@@ ambique , said that the local police had already followed the case :
PR@@ M believes that the sham@@ ans are involved in the death of the bald men .
the persecution and murder of bald individuals for the extraction and sale of their organs in the district of Mor@@ rum@@ ba , province of Z@@ amb@@ Ã©@@ zia , has been commissioned by the traditional sham@@ ans , which also attracts the police of the Republic of Moz@@ ambique , which also indicates that a faith existed , according to which the victims in the head might have power to generate the riches .
in recent days , three men with hair loss problems have been murdered in this part of the country .
on Facebook Angela F@@ errei@@ ra Sam@@ an@@ tha shared the chron@@ icle of the B@@ log@@ gers poor Sn@@ ai@@ ppa , who suggested that the problem is part of the greater social difficulty facing Moz@@ ambique :
I M@@ Ã@@ CH@@ TE GER@@ NE E@@ IN Moz@@ ambique , THE S@@ ME is ashamed of a country in which people would be ashamed to ask for good grades , work and other services , a nation in which people would not hurt or even take their lives to earn their bread , a country in which neither the Al@@ bin@@ os nor bald or bald @-@ headed for super@@ fi@@ del purposes or &quot; black magic . &quot;
despite the seri@@ ousness of the phenomenon , some missed the opportunity for mac@@ ab@@ re humour .
Zen@@ aida Mach@@ ado , scientist of Human Rights Watch for Angola and Moz@@ ambique and enthusiastic t@@ witter user , twe@@ et@@ ete that both the chief of the district Mor@@ rum@@ ba , Pedro S@@ ange and the police officer Z@@ amb@@ Ã©@@ zi@@ as , In@@ Ã¡@@ cio D@@ ina , are both smooth @-@ headed :
Moz@@ ambi@@ can authorities are very concerned about the mur@@ ders of bald people .

we are deeply affected by the death of our friend Bass@@ el K@@ hart@@ ab@@ il .
we mo@@ urn for him and speak our deeply felt con@@ dol@@ ences to his family , his friends and all those who have known him and loved him .
a pioneer of the Creative Com@@ mons in Syria , active in projects such as Mozilla Firefox and Wikipedia , Bass@@ el K@@ hart@@ ab@@ il ( also known as Bass@@ el Saf@@ adi ) played a key role in expanding public access to the Internet and Open Knowledge .
he was a close friend of many of the Global Vo@@ ices community and took part in our meeting of Arab blo@@ ggers in 2009 .
in November 2015 , the wife N@@ our@@ a G@@ haz@@ i reported that she had been contacted by persons who were themselves insi@@ ders of the Assad government .
they reported that their husband had been condemned to death , but gave no further information .
Bas@@ le &apos;s stay and constitution were unknown until today ( August 01 , 2017 ) when N@@ our@@ a learned from Syrian officials that he was executed in 2015 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today and in the future , we will pay tribute to the work of Bass@@ el as a pioneer of the open web movement . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and we appreciate the efforts of all the people and organisations that have been campaig@@ ning for their release in the last five years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
since 2011 and the start of the protests against the regime of Bash@@ ar al @-@ Assad more than 65@@ ,000 people have disappeared , the organization Syrian Network for Human Rights .
countless of those arrested by the regime or forci@@ bly disappeared , are subjected to torture and even exec@@ utions .
between 2011 and 2016 , not less than 17,@@ 7@@ 23 Syrians have come to death in awareness , so the international human rights organisation Am@@ nesty International .

a photo by Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o and Li@@ u X@@ ia , probably made just recently .
this story was originally published on 8 July 2017 in Hong Kong Free Press .
the following version will be published as part of a partnership agreement via Global Vo@@ ices .
the case of the imprisoned Chinese dissi@@ dent Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o has attracted attention in the international community after his lawyer announced at the end of June that he was hospit@@ alized for liver cancer in the final stage .
in 2009 , Li@@ u was sentenced to eleven years in prison for &quot; Subversion &quot; ( state threat ) , having participated in the draft Charter 08 , a manifest@@ o demanding democratic reforms in China .
he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for his work in 2010 .
the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in China has called Li@@ u &apos;s case as &quot; an internal affair &quot; and nar@@ rates a spokesperson , he considered it &quot; not necessary to discuss this matter with any other country . &quot;
nevertheless , China continues to receive calls from the international community , Nobel lau@@ re@@ ates and his wife , den@@ ser Li@@ u X@@ ia , to release him or to allow him treatment abroad .
while some countries critici@@ zed the strict treatment of the couple in Beijing , other countries are completely wi@@ ped out .
Hong Kong Free Press has sum@@ mar@@ ised some reactions from abroad .
United Nations : United Nations
Zei@@ d R@@ a @-@ ad al @-@ Hussein , the High Commissioner of the United Nations for Human Rights , met Chinese officials at the end of June in order to discuss the case of Li@@ u .
however , a spokes@@ man refused to comment on whether the United Nations should exercise pressure to permit treatment abroad .
Norway . Norway
Norway &apos;s Prime Minister Er@@ na Sol@@ berg and Foreign Minister B@@ Ã¸r@@ ge Br@@ ende refused to answer questions about Li@@ u &apos;s release .
the relationship between China and Norway was st@@ alled after the Nobel Peace Prize in 2010 was awarded to Li@@ u , although the Norwegian government announced that it was ultimately nothing to do with the decision .
diplomatic relations were resum@@ ed only in December last year . only in June Norway signed an agreement to resume the Sal@@ mon exports to China , as exports have been largely blocked since 2010 .
after the news spread that Li@@ u was seriously ill , the Nobel Committee expressed his hope for unconditional release and invited Li@@ u to pick up his prize in Oslo .
because of his imprisonment , he was unable to accept his price .
during the ceremony Li@@ u was represented by an empty chair .
the European Union
on 6 July , the European Parliament adopted a resolution calling on China to release Li@@ u and his wife immediately from house arrest and allow him to seek medical support wherever he wants .
the top diplom@@ at of the EU , Feder@@ ica Mo@@ gher@@ ini , also called on China to release Li@@ us , as stated in an explanation on June 30 :
at the same time , we expect China to highlight all the restrictions of Mr. Li@@ u &apos;s wife and family members .
they should meet and receive all the visits they wish , and be able to communicate freely with the outside world .
United States of America
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; us Ambassador Ter@@ ry Bran@@ stad told us that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Americans &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wish him the possibility of treatment abroad , in so far as it helps him in his recovery . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a spokesperson on the US Embassy in China , Mary Beth Pol@@ ley , announced the news agency AF@@ P on 27 June that the message aff@@ or@@ ded the Chinese authorities not only to release Li@@ u , but also to liber@@ ate his wife Li@@ u X@@ ia from house arrest .
the request of the US Embassy drew a fur@@ ious answer from China , with the utter@@ ance of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs , that &quot; no country has the right to interfere and make ir@@ responsible remarks on Chinese internal affairs . &quot;
Pol@@ ley said that China should offer the couple the following :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; protection and freedom such as freedom of travel and access to medical care of his choice , to which they are entitled according to the Chinese constitution and legal system and international obligations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the U.S. Sen@@ ators Marco Ru@@ bio , Jeff Merk@@ ley and T@@ ed Cruz have also adopted a resolution in Congress to urge the Chinese government to un@@ condition@@ ally release Li@@ u and his wife .
I urge China to release the Nobel lau@@ re@@ ate # Li@@ u@@ Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o un@@ condition@@ ally so that it can go into proper medical treatment . ht@@ t@@ p : / / bit@@ .@@ ly / 2@@ t@@ E@@ 6@@ k@@ U@@ o
Germany : Germany
German government spokes@@ man Steffen Sei@@ bert wrote on July 3 , Berlin that Li@@ u &quot; receives all the medical support he needs , &quot; and that a &quot; humanitarian solution for Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o should be the highest priority . &quot;
Chinese President X@@ i J@@ in@@ ping appeared on 7 and 8 July at the G@@ 20 summit in Hamburg .
previously , diplomatic sources in Beijing were reported to the news agency Reu@@ ters that China had great concerns about whether the vor@@ tex around Li@@ u could over@@ shadow the visit to Hamburg .
Canada - Canada
on 28 June , Canadian Ambassador John Mc@@ Call@@ um urged China to provide Li@@ u with adequate medical care and to give him the opportunity to take care of his family .
Li@@ u &apos;s lawyer told AF@@ P that Li@@ u &apos;s wife , Li@@ u X@@ ia could visit him every day , but the police always monitored the room in the hospital and that Li@@ u is not allowed to speak and contact with someone outside , including his lawyers .
Mc@@ Call@@ um further tells :
Canada ur@@ ges China to uph@@ old its international human rights obligations , including freedom of expression , and release the rights contained in the exercise of these rights .
France : France
France &apos;s foreign ministry urged China to release Li@@ u on humanitarian grounds on 29 June :
all necessary measures must be taken to ensure that Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o gets all the treatments he needs , regardless of where required . furthermore , his wife and family should have contact with him .
although the news channel France Info already reported that the French government would welcome Li@@ u in the country , the Ministry of Foreign Affairs announced that there will be no further information whether France will ultimately receive it .
Taiwan - Taiwan
the Council of fixed land affairs in Taiwan invited China on 27 June to release Li@@ u and show a greater tolerance towards those who employ peaceful means to demand political reforms and democratic development .
the Tai@@ wan@@ ese legisl@@ ator Yu @-@ Me@@ i @-@ n@@ u from the ruling Democratic Progressive Party also urged China to allow the sick intellectual Li@@ u to be treated in Taiwan .
Dalai Lama
the spiritual leader in Tibet , the Dalai Lama , was very concerned in an explanation on 28 June around Li@@ u and admitted that many asked him to pray for Li@@ u &apos;s well @-@ being .
he said about Li@@ u :
it is my belief that the initiatives he took and for whom he was severely punished , would have led to a more harmonious , stable and prosper@@ ous China , which in turn would have contributed to a more peaceful world .
I personally felt very moved and encouraged when I saw hundreds of Chinese intellec@@ tuals and affected citizens , inspired by Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o , who signed Charter 08 , which stands for democracy , freedom and rule of law in China .
Singapore : city or country ?
Singapore .
license : CC@@ 0 Dom@@ aine Public
is Singapore a city or a country ?
the question may seem stupid , since Singapore is recognized as an independent state at an international level .
but according to the Minister of Justice , K. Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam , Singapore should be considered a city .
this re@@ mark has triggered a debate in the blo@@ g@@ osphere .
during the meeting on the occasion of a meeting of the international branch of the Bar Association of New York , the Minister noted that many people critic@@ ised the domin@@ ance of Singapore &apos;s only political party because they compared Singapore to other countries .
he supports Singapore to be considered a city .
... no one has questioned whether New York is a democracy ...
that &apos;s it , most people commit a mistake .
I have tried to explain that we are different .
we are a city .
we are not a country .
the blog Cav@@ ali@@ eri@@ o accused the Minister of Justice to &quot; twist the logic &quot; in order to defend the existing author@@ itarian exercise of power in Singapore .
and then , after all our efforts and sacrifices to create this precious land , one hears that we are ultimately not a country .
it sounded so vul@@ gar , it had the appearance of an escape from the responsibilities , a breach of duty .
Singapore , if you are not my country , whose land is it then ?
the reasons cited by Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam were not very no@@ bel : he defended an idea , according to which one could not measure the Singapore political system with other &apos; normal countries &apos; , considering that , he seemed in@@ vari@@ ably un@@ democratic .
on the other hand , he defended the idea that Singapore should be compared to cities such as Chicago , San Francisco or New York , equally cities that are permanently run by a party .
these cities are democratic .
as soon as one reaches the core of the subject , the good old ly@@ re appears again from the author@@ itarian rulers who pre@@ tend to be democr@@ ats , leaving the distorted logic , since it is better suited to their power .
in the end , the answers to his American guests in the last week of Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam were really non @-@ answers concerning our press , our judi@@ ci@@ ary , our political system .
he answers corresponding questions with a non @-@ answers rational manner .
Rachel Z@@ eng calls on Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam to clarify his opinion as she did not understand this conclusion .
personally , I find it a bit difficult to swal@@ low .
if Singapore is not a country , it is a city , so to which country belongs our city ...
in short , I don &apos;t understand anything .
I would be very grateful if our dear K Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam would take the trouble to clarify this point if he was highly paid to be part of the government of the city of Singapore .
by publishing his commentary on the blog , he points out that one should start reading the whole tran@@ script of the conference in order to better understand the context of the statements of Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam , according to which Singapore is a city and no country .
read the tran@@ script .
when he said that Singapore is more of a city than a country , &quot; he explained why the Singapore elections are so un@@ important even if we enjoy free and fair elections .
he compared Singapore with cities in the USA ( and how many of these cities saw a party for decades ? ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when he said Singapore &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; be not a country , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he obviously did not mean it in this sense ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Cl@@ ement T@@ an shows his disappointment about Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam , who as leader of a growing generation , makes such a pol@@ em@@ ical statement .
I am very embarrass@@ ed about what the Minister of Justice of Singapore said ...
at least I knew with Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew and the members of the old guard what I expected - whether I agree with them or not , but that &apos;s another thing .
but with K. Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam , member of the new generation of the political leaders of Singapore , I have doubts and I &apos;m not even sure if he really believes he is properly associated and aware of what he def@@ ends .
the TE@@ MA@@ SE@@ K review disman@@ tles the weak points of Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ g@@ ams &apos;s arguments :
has Mr. Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam &quot; believed an error &quot; or was it a Freu@@ dian spokesperson ?
if Singapore is not a country , we are regarded only as an independent and sovereign state ?
if not , to which country do the sovereign rights of the city of Singapore go back ?
Singapore is unique , it is equally land and city .
since it plays an important role within the government cabinet , the statements of Mr. Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam are of serious importance .
why do the people of Singapore do their military service , but do they defend their city only ?
who does our prime minister have to pay bills ?
what is the value of our pink identity card ?
are we the citizens of a country or the inhabitants of a city ?
the magazine Journey of a Dec@@ ade adds to Be@@ j@@ ah@@ ung , Singapore and has always been a city :
&quot; I didn &apos;t say what I said ... &quot;
this sentence seems to have anger@@ ed many people of Singapore ...
nobody ever said that Singapore is a country .
we were always a city .
we have always been a city / island state .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I can understand that we often hear statements like &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; defense of the country especially &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; but that is not quite correct . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we should rather talk about the defence of the city .
the myth of the &quot; nice Canadian &quot;
Canadian N@@ ed Flan@@ ders .
screen@@ shot from a YouTube video .
global Vo@@ ices asked recently his editors : what is the most mis@@ understood aspect of your home or homeland ?
their answers are published here as part of a continuous series , with which rum@@ ors about certain parts of the world are revealed and another fac@@ et is to be shown .
the latest part of this series comes from Nev@@ in Thom@@ p@@ son , editor for Global Vo@@ ices Japan , who lives in Canada and Japan .
the question I asked most in Japan is : &quot; are you Americans ? &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no , I am sorry , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I come from Canada . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have been living in Japan since 1994 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
depending on the situation in which the conversation takes place , it is considered pol@@ ite to show interest in his conversation partner by asking personal questions .
on my clari@@ fication the standard answer follows : &quot; Oh , Ro@@ cky Mountains , ice ho@@ ckey , nature . &quot; many Can@@ adi@@ ans perhaps cook in@@ war@@ dly against anger when they are held for Americans , but it doesn &apos;t bo@@ ther me .
for someone who doesn &apos;t know himself , there is little that makes us different from Can@@ adi@@ ans of Americans .
this is one of the reasons why so many Can@@ adi@@ ans make a Canadian flag clearly visible on their back@@ pack when they travel .
everyone loves Can@@ adi@@ ans .
Americans , on the other hand , ... .
so it was already when I began to travel through the world 20 years ago - before Donald Tr@@ ump , before the invasion of Iraq and September 11 .
Can@@ adi@@ ans have always carried small map@@ le leaves on their baggage to distinguish themselves from their American neighbors .
we have a free health care !
there are no weapons with us !
same @-@ sex marri@@ ages have been legal in Canada since 2005 !
everyone seems to think , Canada is so great .
we are pol@@ ite .
we obviously say very often &quot; ap@@ ologies . &quot;
Canada is said to be the most toler@@ ant country on ethnic groups .
we are not as these types south of the border .
we Can@@ adi@@ ans are nice .
I hate that .
first , I have many American friends whom I admire very much .
it wouldn &apos;t matter to me if you &apos;d be confused with Johnny from Dallas for example .
with Marc out of Austin .
with Adam from San Francisco .
or with Michael from Hon@@ ol@@ ul@@ u .
there are also some problems with the stamp &apos; nice &apos; .
first : being called &quot; nice , &quot; means to be sp@@ elling - like ben@@ ign , gentle but tra@@ gically in@@ significant figure N@@ ed Flan@@ ders from &quot; The Simp@@ sons &quot; ( which has its own Canadian Doppel@@ gÃ¤n@@ ger ) .
if Canada is really a nation full of people like N@@ ed Flan@@ ders , that would indeed be a step forward . but the real problem is that &quot; nice &quot; does not have personality .
there are no corners and edges , nothing that you can encounter .
being harmless means to be un@@ ob@@ tru@@ sive and un@@ interesting and not to deserve attention .
this can be a good thing if you want to stay in the background un@@ noticed , away from things that happen around you .
I would even go to say that the desire to be free and alone is a major part of the Can@@ adi@@ ans .
we tend to take care of our own affairs .
what out@@ si@@ ders call &quot; nice &quot; is perhaps simply cool courtesy .
Can@@ adi@@ ans do not often talk over the fence with the neighbors .
we lack the warm , open friendliness that I now associate with my American friends .
luckily for us ( and for the rest of the world ) J@@ ustin Tru@@ deau is viewing the stage to show that Can@@ adi@@ ans are more than just &quot; nice . &quot; our prime minister has made Canada virtually sexy .
music video of a pop @-@ band par@@ odi@@ aks Thailand &apos;s j@@ un@@ ta
a pop band famous in Thailand has released a music video that par@@ ano@@ des the Jun@@ ta , which took power in 2014 , and despite its promise to restore the civilian government , continues to rule the country .
the new song &quot; Dic@@ t@@ ator Girl &quot; ( P@@ ha@@ det Girl ) of the Band Tattoo Colour describes a young man who tells him what instructions his girlfriend makes .
although not explicitly political , the music video relates indirectly to the continued military rule of the Jun@@ ta .
the band was praised by many fans and other Internet users for their courage to describe the situation of the country .
the video for the song was a huge success .
on Facebook alone within the first three days , the video uploaded on Facebook was 1.@@ 25@@ 4 times and received 8,@@ 800 votes .
last month , even Charlie Chap@@ lin video &quot; The dict@@ ator &quot; in Thailand was blocked after a group of activists appe@@ aled to the public to watch this video .
the video can be interpreted as a creative and entertaining introduction to Thai politics , particularly as it relates to the situation of the country under the j@@ un@@ ta rule .
take a look at these videos from the videos that relate to some of the political themes that Thailand has persist@@ ently pursued in the past three years .
the &quot; 44 rules of the girls &quot; may refer to the dra@@ con@@ ian section 44 of the preliminary constitution , which gives the commander @-@ in @-@ chief of the army absolute decision making over important national issues .
the 11th rule : &quot; change your attitude &quot; refers to the not@@ orious program of &quot; changing the settings &quot; of journalists , students , scientists , activists , politicians and other persons who are considered critics of the Jun@@ ta .
the picture above reflects the introduction of the law on computer crime , whose vag@@ ue and unclear rules are often used by the authorities to arrest activists and other critics of the state .
for this purpose , a new unit has also been established in the army which monitors online content and persons accused of having slan@@ dered the monarchy to be prosec@@ uted .
Thailand implements a strict ple@@ a against &quot; L@@ ese Maj@@ este &quot; ( maj@@ esty ) .
on 20 May 2014 martial law was proclaimed in Thailand .
two days later , a coup led by the army .
one of the problems that the Jun@@ ta continues to pursue is their decision to buy expensive sub@@ mar@@ ines , although security experts warned them that the purchase is unnecessary and a waste of tax@@ pay@@ ers .
in the video , it is even shown how people are thrown into a black delivery van before bringing them into an intern@@ ment camp , another problem .
some journalists are in prison because they allegedly caused &quot; confusion &quot; in society and Internet users are threatened with long jail sentences , they should off@@ end the monarchy .
meanwhile , the te@@ aser of the songs showed members of the band , who im@@ itated the Sal@@ ut from &quot; The Tri@@ bute of Pan@@ em , &quot; which was already used by coup opponents during the protests in 2014 .
life continues in the ruins of gh@@ ost towns in eastern Asia

the following article , written by D@@ mit@@ ri Stat@@ ey@@ nov , was first published on the website of OC Media and appears here with kind permission .
the post @-@ war society is recovered very slowly in East Asia , especially in the district of T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al .
now more than 20 years have passed since the Geor@@ gian @-@ Ab@@ ch@@ as@@ sic war has been officially terminated , but its sc@@ ars are still visible in this part of the republic .
the abandoned villages of the northern district in T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al are showing striking images .
villages like D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha , Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a , Py@@ at@@ aya Sha@@ k@@ h@@ ta , Poly@@ ana and K@@ har@@ chil@@ ava are located in the hydro@@ carb@@ ons of Ab@@ ch@@ asia .
various ethnic groups such as Russians , Greeks , Eur@@ asia , Geor@@ gi@@ ans and Armen@@ ians lived and worked on Soviet sites in the area .
many of them had to leave their homes during the war .
today , most of the Russians and rab@@ bits live in the area .
such settlements are also called gh@@ ost cities in Ab@@ ch@@ asia .
in the pre @-@ war period more than 10,000 people lived here , today only a few hundred people are in these gh@@ ost cities .
this phenomenon is characteristic of T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al .
since 2011 , the total population of the district was 16@@ ,000 people after having barely stepped up over a decade .
in 1989 about 4@@ 3,000 people lived in this district .

the empty five @-@ storey blocks of the Soviet Union from the early 1960s , called K@@ hr@@ ush@@ ch@@ uk@@ ow@@ kas , symboli@@ ze the decline and devast@@ ation of the region .
the buildings are falling and very rarely they are inhabited by more than two families .

at the entrance of the village D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha I met a native elderly man .
he begins a conversation and it is difficult for him to end this .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all this is a consequence of the war . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; can I talk to you ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why speak ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is nevertheless un@@ ambig@@ uous . &quot;
before the war the village was full of life .
there were community centers , schools and kinder@@ gar@@ tens , all of which served the community .
now there is only paved road with f@@ aded glory buildings .
the people who once lived in this place and made their contribution to the central plan economy of the Soviet Union have meanwhile left the district .
in the gh@@ ost town of D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha , about fifty inhabitants live .
about 38 people live in Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a , in the other villages it looks similar .
the ch@@ ry@@ osh@@ ka , which still houses one or two families , can be seen at the balconies where laundry is dried .
two young girls , both seven years old , look out of the window of a destroyed house .
when they discover me with the camera in my hand , they withdraw immediately .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our Mother has forbidden us to take pictures , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says one of the girls . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she simply for@@ ba@@ de us , that &apos;s all . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the girl whis@@ pers something to her girlfriend and suddenly she leaves the destroyed building and disappears .
many people in the area work for a small Turkish mining company called T@@ ku@@ arch@@ alu@@ go@@ l .
families are also involved in the sub@@ sist@@ ence economy ( cultiv@@ ating agricultural products for self @-@ consumption ) such as livestock , be@@ eke@@ eping and vegetable farming .
it is difficult to get over the rounds .
the district administration provides free candles and bread to the villages in winter .

about ten years ago an older woman named Gal@@ ina ( or T@@ ante G@@ aly@@ a as she is called in the neighborhood ) from Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a to Dsch@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha .
despite her el@@ dest daughter who lives in France , Gal@@ ina does not have to leave Ab@@ ch@@ asia in order to live with her . &quot; my heart will remain in Ab@@ ch@@ asia forever , &quot; she says .
Gal@@ ina does not want to receive financial help from her daughter and insi@@ sts she supports her young grand@@ children instead .
Gal@@ inas &apos;s monthly pension is just nine dollars .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you have neither a vegetable garden nor a house , it is very difficult to survive , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are not afraid of the dark road or the few people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
you can get used to everything .
many people believe that these buildings were destroyed during the war .
in fact , it has something to do with lo@@ oting .
after the war there was hardly any work and everyone lived as they were right .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I remember every day how the city and the war were once . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
when our conversation tends to end , a little boy runs over to us .
it runs through the window of a destroyed building and hides itself .
a ball flies out of the window and another boy follows him afterwards .
he plays with the ball rolling down the hill .
a group of children now pursu@@ es the ball scre@@ aming .
while they run , some of them throw stones on the fallen buildings .
these ruins are part of their childhood , which ensure inf@@ eri@@ ority in their lives .
you don &apos;t know it differently .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Mexico &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mama Africa &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hosts migrants on their long journey

this article by A@@ my Bra@@ cken was published on April 19 , 2017 on the website of our partner PRI@@ .org and appears here with kind permission .
on the way of migrants crossing Europe or Latin America , certain places are known for their hospitality .
I visited one of these places in the Mexican city of Tap@@ ach@@ ula , it is located on the border to Guatemala .
it is a very simple hotel near the city center .
it is led by a 59@@ th year old Mexican woman , a small woman with a coral @-@ pink frame and gold colored earrings in ted@@ dy bear shape .
she is called Con@@ cep@@ ci@@ Ã³n Gon@@ z@@ Ã¡@@ lez Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez and was born in Tap@@ ach@@ ula and grew up there . nevertheless , they know many under the name of Mama Africa .
this nick@@ name is due to the fact that the hotel ( or rather it itself ) has become a destination for Afri@@ cans and Hai@@ tians who are on the transit .
the hotel has no charm .
for approximately 2.@@ 50 dollars the night the guests sleep in simple rooms , with bare , crum@@ bling walls and beds made of metal .
in the anter@@ oom there is a par@@ rot in a cage .
there is no sign for the hotel - yet hundreds of African and Hai@@ tian migrants are coming here .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sometimes , Ms Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tells people in full mini@@ buses and from the upper part of the coast they begin to cry : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mama Africa ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
where are you mo@@ m Africa ? . &quot;
at the moment it is rather quiet , but this year Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez has already received 200 guests at the same time .
there are only 24 rooms , some have already slept outside on cardboard .
she does not want to reject anybody .
she also helps them and brings them to the hospital when they are sick , she bu@@ ys them drugs that they cannot pay , they massage them with a bal@@ m the feet exhausted by the long journey .
Ty@@ ch@@ que Sebasti@@ ao , originally from Angola , has arrived recently .
I asked him if M@@ um Africa was an appropriate nick@@ name for Ms Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez .
the family Sebasti@@ ao ( with her daughter Mer@@ call@@ i who has a yo@@ ghurt beard ) pos@@ ing with Con@@ cep@@ ci@@ Ã³n Gon@@ z@@ Ã¡@@ lez Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez .
the family came from Angola to Brazil and hopes to go to Boston .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yes , yes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he answers with a smile . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I really feel that it suits her because African women are very nice women . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
very loving .
she has the warmth of a mother ...
we feel very comfortable here . &quot;
Sebasti@@ ao is traveling with his sister who hopes to go to Boston to find her husband and the three children .
they have lived in Brazil , but it is for some Afri@@ cans who are on their way to the United States to make a first stop in South America and then move north@@ wards .
the family had heard from other companions of Mama Africa . &quot; Mama Africa is a well @-@ known name on the track , &quot; says Felix Michel@@ et , a guest from Haiti .
he tells us that the Hai@@ tians and Afri@@ cans often travel together and that Afri@@ cans are already talking about Mr@@ s Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez on W@@ hat@@ s@@ app .
like many of his companions , Michel@@ et lived in Brazil before and worked as a construction worker on the construction sites of the Olympic Games and the World Cup .
when the Brazilian economy became weaker , he started his trip to the United States .
he has been a guest at M@@ om Africa for months : he sells SIM cards to save the money needed to buy the bus ticket to Ti@@ juana .
I ask him if he will have contact with Mrs. Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez in the future .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mama Africa is our mother and we never let her go again , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says smiling . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ms. Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez tells her that her guests often send text messages when they have gone to greet them or to tell her about the course of their journey .
she explains that her Christian faith is the drive of her work .
she doesn &apos;t know much about Africa , but her guests have taught her to cook chi@@ ckens like in Ghana .
MS Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez is perhaps very well known here , but it is not the only spark of hope for the migrants who travel through Tap@@ ach@@ ula .
at the other end of the city leads a dead end to Jes@@ Ãº@@ s Valen@@ zu@@ ela .
this winter , Valen@@ zu@@ ela and his family have picked up migrants in their small house .
he is a polic@@ eman and has found that the bus tickets are sold to a large number of African immigrants .
he began to help them get a reasonable price , then he offered them his house for one dollar the night .
at the moment there are 25 people , mainly Hai@@ tians .
some sleep on blankets on the floor , but at least they have electricity , a washing machine and a kitchenette outside .
Valen@@ zu@@ ela declares that he knows what the guests are going through .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I lived in the United States , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I crossed the border crossing the desert and we suffered .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are places where people help and others do not help . that &apos;s why I give them my support . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after he lived for three years , he was expelled from the United States after a raid on his job site .
the majority of migrants traveling through Tap@@ ach@@ ula comes from Central America , other residents also open the doors of their homes for them .
JosÃ© Antonio Cor@@ dova Mel@@ Ã©@@ n@@ dez tells me that he fled to Honduras with his wife and three children from people who wanted to black@@ mail him money without having a plan .
in Tap@@ ach@@ ula , he asked for an accommodation and an unknown , an all @-@ one , offered him her roof .
a few months later , the family still lives there and tries to decide where the next steps should go .
back in the house of Mama Africa everything is again full of guests .
in the corri@@ dors , travellers consult their tel@@ eph@@ ones quietly .
a mini@@ bus arrived today and brought 20 new guests , most of them from Somalia .
Mrs. Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez seems happy that her house is full , but she is also nostal@@ gic because of those who have gone away .
like a proud grandmother , she leaves her album with numerous photos .
there is one of her daughter with African hair pla@@ its she has made her an Kun@@ din , some photos of her grand@@ children and many travelers more , boy and old .
she laughs sadly , while she briefly presents her to me .
&quot; Ya se fu@@ er@@ on , &quot; repe@@ ats it every time . &quot; they have already gone . &quot;
China : X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang residents are forced to install a surveillance app on their mobile phones .
a check point for personal communication devices in X@@ inj@@ ang of t@@ witter @-@ user @-@ based con@@ ges@@ tion .
the inhabitants of X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang , an ethnic minority in western China , are forced to install a sp@@ y@@ ware on their mobile phones .
on 10 July , mobile users in the Ti@@ an@@ sh@@ an District of Ur@@ um@@ qi received a mobile notification in which they instruc@@ t the district government to install a surveillance app called J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang ( or &quot; Web Cleaning &quot; ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the message it is said that the app will prevent &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; get access to terrorist information &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , the authorities tried to use the app for more than fighting terrorism .
according to an exclusive report by Radio Free Asia , 10 Kaz@@ ak@@ h women were arrested in the autonomous Il@@ i Kaz@@ ak@@ h pre@@ f@@ ecture , because they had sent messages with a private We@@ Chat group shortly after they had installed the app .
the police reported that the app would investigate and track the sources and distribution channels of the terrorists along with &quot; illegal religious &quot; activities and &quot; harmful information &quot; including videos , images , e@@ Books and documents .
J@@ ing@@ wan@@ ger &apos;s website describes the app as follows :
J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang is a protection service with system categories for children and adults , introduced by Ji@@ angs@@ u T@@ elec@@ om .
the main feature is blocking por@@ no@@ graphic websites , online fraud , tro@@ j@@ ans and ph@@ ishing pages to alert users how much time they spend online and to remotely control their home network .
this app for min@@ ors is intended to help children develop a healthy lifestyle .
an app with these functions can of course be used in many ways .
for example , the &quot; remote control &quot; could enable state actors or even h@@ ack@@ ers to manipul@@ ate or steal a person &apos;s home network .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this introduction is in line with other measures to control the digital activities in this region . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
while noti@@ fications of digital cens@@ orship in China mostly focus on the experiences of users in larger cities in the East and the South , reality is very often glo@@ omy for those living in remote , crowded ethnic minority regions such as X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang and Tibet .
in order to limit un@@ rest and dis@@ content in conflict areas , the authorities often associate extreme cens@@ ors and surveillance measures as well as rout@@ inely Internet shut@@ downs .
the Twitter @-@ based media outlet &quot; Images from mainland China &quot; published cens@@ ored news in China showed photos of a check@@ point where polic@@ emen checked the occup@@ ants random@@ ly to see if they had installed the monitoring app .
the authorities in X@@ inj@@ ian make sure that people use the official J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang app .
a mobile notification demanded that people install the app within 10 days .
if you are detected at a check@@ point with a device without this software , they may be imprisoned for up to 10 days .
this is a set@@ back for technological development .
you have forced people to use devices that are intended for older people .
this is a form of captivity by the rest technology .
we are back in Ma@@ os China .
a J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang product description also published a J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang product description indicating that the software can lift the password request of a Windows operating system and thus un@@ restricted access to the computer &apos;s hard drive .
after installing J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang , computers and mobile phones are turned into electronic hand@@ cu@@ ffs in X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the provisions in J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang may be a reaction to the statements of the City Party Council to minim@@ ise the dis@@ semination of illegal content . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
all branches of government , authorities and related institutions , including universities and research institutions , are obliged to follow the instructions of the cy@@ ber security office during operation of their computers and communication devices .
a recent Freedom House report , an American human rights organization , also mentioned these new surveillance methods :
in X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang , on June 27 , in a district of the regional capital of Ur@@ um@@ qi , the authorities issued an ordin@@ ance with the directive to all residents and entrepreneurs to register their &quot; personal ID cards , mobile phones , external drives , portable hard drives , not@@ ebooks and media memory cards &quot; at the local police .
the intention is obviously to identify and destroy any &quot; terrorist &quot; videos . however , this action viol@@ ates the personal rights of Ur@@ um@@ qu@@ is three million inhabitants and gives them pen@@ alties for a whole range of other possible violations , including those relating to peaceful religious or political messages .
sleep or death , part 1 : everything scre@@ ams after death
a single cell in Old Dub@@ bo Ga@@ ol .
photo by : Cor@@ rie B@@ ark@@ li@@ more ( CC B@@ Y 2.0 ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the first of six reports in the series &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sleep or death &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; in which the activ@@ ist Sar@@ mad Al J@@ il@@ ane has described his experiences in a Syrian prison . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
far away from our blue , virtual world , you look at yourself and discover that you are all alone in a place where everything is missing .
everything has gradually dissip@@ ated and revealed a truth that is clearly identi@@ fiable both from within and from outside .
one that makes all honor to their name .
one who has struck down in a list of feelings and expressions that do not allow metaph@@ ors .
but when reality re@@ covers you and you look behind the scenes - beyond the drama , the beautiful scenes and the actors - the characters transform themselves into beings of flesh and blood , and all scre@@ ams for death .
all doubts arise in smoke and you will become aware of your existence , even if the earth is spinning on the axis of the evil . it becomes clear to you that you are trapped here between the walls that your parents , and before them your grand@@ parents , stone built by stone .
they have arrested me and my father three times , but that wasn &apos;t enough for me to &quot; learn my lesson , &quot; as the Chief of the Security Service formulated it - with the promise that the fourth time would be a pleasure .
he proved his power over us by destroying even the simplest concepts we knew .
five young people were torn out of the beautiful garden of our revolution during a peaceful protest like we@@ eds .
it was enough for the city to break the darkness of the night with &quot; All@@ ahu Ak@@ bar &quot; cries .
all the districts sought , only my own did not .
for the first time it was still , moti@@ on@@ less , at the wrong time , even if I did not make high demands on a city that is stuff@@ ed up into the arter@@ ies with state security organisms and their ac@@ compli@@ ces .
in the third night things had cal@@ med down after the power supply stopped functioning in the neighborhood .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I broke the silence by scre@@ aming several times &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; All@@ ahu ak@@ bar &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from my roof . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I heard my voice echo through silence .
a few minutes later , some of my friends felt brave enough to come together .
I was not alone .
many friends , true friends joined me ; we al@@ lied to a splendid picture that filled my expectations completely .
at such a moment you are aware that you liber@@ ate the mind from the lamp , but it simply does not interest you in the slightest .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I received a call from my father : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; prepare , we meet at the military security building . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he laid on .
then I learned the following : no matter how much honey you can swal@@ low - nothing can give you back your voice , after giving it all the way up to the office of security service out of the body .
I arrived there .
the Col@@ onel Gh@@ ass@@ an was there with several of his men ; my father was already there , as I now .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Col@@ onel Gh@@ ass@@ an begins to speak : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; let me hear how you write &quot; All@@ ahu ak@@ bar &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; or you &apos;re only brave enough to sh@@ out when we &apos;re not close . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his hat@@ eful eyes set on me .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and you &apos;re sad to look into my eyes and not on the ground ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
what I then did has nothing to do with courage .
I was 18 years old , it was the fourth time I stood in front of this building .
perhaps it was because of my fool@@ ish@@ ness , vanity ; perhaps in the revolution .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was so sure of my cause as I replied , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I didn &apos;t think you &apos;ve forgotten my voice since yesterday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and I think I never stopped watching you , so why should I do it right now ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was the shortest entertainment that could have such fatal consequences for me , and yet I don &apos;t regret a word from what I said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; put him in sol@@ itary confin@@ ement and his father immediately . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; his father straight away . &quot;
the sten@@ ch of this cursed sentence is up to this day in the nose .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he became a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; syndrome , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; a mental torture that I was subjected to for months . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I went through the courtyard .
in the first office I leave everything I wear with me .
then back through the courtyard and into the second office , which leads through a corridor to the individual cells .
I found all the details exactly before I entered the room .
differently than usual , they have assigned me a larger cell this time .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have to share it with only one other prisoner and can immediately set me without waiting for their permission . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after a few minutes , felt like a whole life , the official left the cell and I res@@ or@@ ted to a tried @-@ and @-@ tested method of communication : beating his fist against the wall .
I learned that my cell com@@ rade was a &quot; Er@@ s@@ th@@ Ã¤@@ ft@@ ling . &quot;
after a long hes@@ itation he finally answered me .
apparently in none of the surrounding cells there was a respected middle @-@ aged man , who looks like me and is called &quot; the doctor . &quot;
in the perfect darkness , no prominent facial features can be recognized by me , and doctors don &apos;t exist here ; we are all just numbers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; maybe someone whose voice sounds similar to my ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
all the answers deny its existence .
perhaps he was transferred to one of the big cells .
perhaps he will stop immediately .
the investig@@ ator assured me that they would release him if I remain .
li@@ ars .
I would have liked to have had a scar@@ ec@@ row to drive out all these crow@@ s that lab@@ ored in the garden of my head .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from afar I still hear it &quot; All@@ ahu ak@@ bar &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it must be about 10 o &apos;clock in the evening ; always at this time the cries ev@@ oke every day .
the door opens .
I was always convinced that black is the colour of per@@ dition until I saw the yellow light that presented us the horror in person : the Ra@@ ad ( about : &quot; th@@ under , &quot; all@@ usion to the 13th Sh@@ ure of the Koran ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they are here to be heard . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
with this the secret was revealed : in order to protect the state security against us and to prevent us from fre@@ eing the tra@@ itor and the terrorists in us , they speak in the al@@ a@@ wi@@ tic dialect - thus they played their denom@@ in@@ ational black@@ mail and betra@@ yed the close vision of their world@@ view .
this is not a house that is not a country here ; it is a curse that they call co@@ existence to transform the criminals of their c@@ lans into a hero .
I enter the inter@@ rog@@ ation room and meet Abu Ima@@ d , a lean and sto@@ cky man ; at least he seems like me .
he starts a &quot; pleasant &quot; conversation , despite the facial expressions that let him slip : &quot; my boy , you are still young , you can start so much more important with your life than to join those Ta@@ ge@@ dians and protest on demonstrations that will soon come to an end anyway . &quot;
I did not answer .
I got used to it , not to answer .
I can really no longer tell exactly when insul@@ ts and pun@@ ches have become an ordinary means of communication for me .
when and how that happened was un@@ important .
some voice in me said that I had to get used to being punished if I had done nothing to make this tor@@ ment .
on punishment in all its diversity .
his command is to tear me as much meat as possible from the body .
he calls the aff@@ ection@@ ate &quot; confession . &quot;
it starts with a plastic tube that probably comes from the clo@@ aks .
your exec@@ ution@@ er delights in your cry .
give him the pleasure , you cannot measure with him , and you cannot hold back your cry .
my scre@@ ams were not enough for him , so they exchanged the tube with a cable .
during my first arrest I asked myself if the investig@@ ator had previously worked as a tr@@ ash collector or whether it belonged to normal working equipment .
they had inter@@ tw@@ ined four cables to show us the great invention of a huge cable from their point of view .
within a single hour three of them altern@@ ated while I was still in line .
I had lost any feeling in my body - and also my voice , which is why I stopped scre@@ aming .
the exec@@ ution@@ er noticed the cooling down and didn &apos;t take any fav@@ ours , which is why he was coming next to an electrically charged bar .
electricity flow@@ ed through my whole body , enough to supply my whole neighborhood .
my half @-@ naked body lying on the ground was the perfect conductor .
the num@@ b@@ ness disappeared and the pain was there again .
after two terrible hours he decided that he had fulfilled his duty for that night .
this must have been around midnight .
I decided to sleep again ; let &apos;s say that was my only option .
some hours passed , which seemed to me like minutes .
then the call to the morning prayer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the door opens and the morning light fills the room . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; R@@ aus with you , Ar@@ sch@@ fe@@ cker . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I answer with the voice of an exhausted youth : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my Lord , my Father has to worry about terrible things . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; be still and move away , you will be moved . &quot;
this was new .
otherwise they always had me released .
where do they lead me ? !
the Jord@@ anian R@@ apper Em@@ s@@ all@@ am H@@ da@@ i@@ b talks about the rights of the LG@@ BT@@ Q + community , freedom of expression and opposition
Em@@ s@@ all@@ am H@@ da@@ i@@ b smo@@ kes a cigarette in his studio .
the photo was taken by A@@ man Mad@@ an , the original author of this text .
Em@@ s@@ all@@ am H@@ da@@ i@@ b sp@@ ends most of his time inside ; sometimes he si@@ ps to his canvas , sometimes to his computer , back and back to his couch .
but what you can rely on is a cigarette between your fingers or your ni@@ cot@@ ine @-@ stained lips .
he lives in the upper floor of his family house , which belonged to them since 1967 ; the year in which Israel completed his occupation of the West Bank and forced H@@ da@@ i@@ bs &apos;s family to escape from her village in Palestine , where they lived as fel@@ ic@@ ye@@ en ( about : Far@@ mer ) .
for six years , H@@ da@@ i@@ b has been a passionate activ@@ ist who faces the conservative majority and questioned their well @-@ established opinions on gender roles , sexu@@ ality and freedom of expression through art and rap@@ es@@ eed music .
with his music , which often deals with topics such as ori@@ ent@@ alism , rac@@ ism and the situation of Palestinian ge@@ aring , he also calls out the core of the entire Arab world . all these topics are not only relevant in his hom@@ etown of Am@@ man , but also in cities that range from Damascus to Syria to San@@ aa , Yemen .
with his 25 years , H@@ da@@ i@@ b sees himself as someone who is not restricted by boundaries in his mind , and he can feel with people suffering from the disa@@ strous consequences of foreign interventions in countries such as Iraq , Yemen , Syria and Libya .
even if he does not admit it openly , he has a special tendency toward U.S. foreign policy .
H@@ da@@ i@@ b contem@@ plates his art in his studio in Am@@ man .
recorded by the author .
H@@ da@@ i@@ b does not believe that his sympathy for those who try to survive in war zones , to do anything with his identity as &quot; Palestinian refugees from the second generation , &quot; he calls himself even though he was born in Jordan and has never been in Palestine .
&quot; I don &apos;t think about my own circumstances of life , &quot; H@@ da@@ i@@ b emphas@@ ises .
then he adds : &quot; I think so , because I am a man , &quot; while in water dissolved Nes@@ cafÃ© in two cups . it is the holy month of Ram@@ adan ; during this time it is intended for Muslims to fast from sunrise to sunset .
the Jord@@ anian law also states that the public consumption of food during Ram@@ adan is illegal .
obviously H@@ da@@ i@@ b has a certain weakness to break with age @-@ old traditions ; on the other hand , a cup of coffee on a hot young day has little to do with protest against Islam .
in principle , the che@@ ek of lu@@ ke@@ warm coffee and the swa@@ ying of the K@@ ent @-@ cigarette in the nose first of all speak of freedom .
sometimes Jordan feels like a prison under the open sky , especially if you look at neighbouring countries .
therefore , it is easy to do basic things - as in the public during Ram@@ adan - to drink water - in order not to land in prison .
recently , the Interior Ministry of Jordan has cancelled a performance by the band M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ Lei@@ la , already for the second time .
some MPs who support the Islamic Action Front - the Jord@@ anian branch of the Muslim Brotherhood - argue that the sexual orientation of the hom@@ os@@ exual fron@@ ts@@ man Ham@@ ed Sinn@@ o , contradic@@ ts the cultural and traditional norms of the country and is the main reason for the concert announcement .
the de@@ pu@@ ties and former press spokesperson of the Islamic coalition Dim@@ a Tah@@ bou@@ b said in an interview with CN@@ N that the concert was &quot; just &quot; because of the sexual orientation of the singer .
many also claim that the engagement of the band in matters such as the Arab Spring , human rights and freedom of expression in the Arab world is dangerous activ@@ ism , which poses the tried @-@ and @-@ tested legi@@ timacy of author@@ itarian regimes across the region .
in a public statement , M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ Lei@@ la estimated the Jord@@ anian people as &quot; progressive supporters of human rights , &quot; who continue to &quot; opt for an intellectual and cultural pl@@ ur@@ alism . &quot;
this statement might not be simply shallow rhet@@ oric , but actually mirr@@ ored a more and more clearly cryst@@ alli@@ zing reality in Jordan , which appears clearly in H@@ da@@ i@@ b &apos;s work .
in 2016 , H@@ da@@ i@@ b returned to the traditional gender norms by forming his vision of the fate of Arab women who have mar@@ ital sex .
the picture shows the skel@@ eton of an apparently worn unknown woman , whose arms and legs stretch up to the corners of the canvas .
it is surrounded by a red lake ; perhaps the blood of the countless women who have lost their lives by the hands of those whom they should actually trust .
in recent years , the number of &apos; lau@@ re@@ ates &apos; has increased in Jordan - the un@@ official outside .
according to Human Rights Watch , the number of lau@@ re@@ ates reached its peak in 2016 ; however , it is still difficult to add that Jordan is lacking institutional infrastructure to support women who have been victims of murder or domestic violence in appropriate ways .
according to a law on comb@@ ating crime from 1954 , women who are exposed to the danger of domestic violence can be arrested in@@ definitely in prison , &quot; and for their release many years of bureaucratic expenditure and the guarantee of the family are often necessary for the woman to do nothing .
H@@ da@@ i@@ b &apos;s music also enjoys great popularity and is known to not shy away from subjects that are long considered t@@ abo@@ o in his country .
H@@ da@@ i@@ b den@@ ies that his work is political , but ad@@ mits that he cannot separate from politics full of explicit reference to sexu@@ ality , freedom and expression .
&quot; I come from the Middle East , man .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; politics was in@@ timi@@ dated to me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in a song called &quot; Edward Sa &apos;@@ ed &quot; H@@ da@@ i@@ b attacks the question of Palestinian identity .
in &quot; Law@@ la al 3@@ ai@@ b &quot; and &quot; Gh@@ are@@ eb , &quot; the focus is on poverty .
the list of songs that are political in the heart can be continued .
in March 2016 , H@@ da@@ i@@ b published a song entitled &quot; Sant@@ and@@ ano . &quot;
in this song , one verse often repe@@ ats itself :
&quot; you are free , and everyone else is it . &quot;
in the further course of the song , H@@ da@@ i@@ b describes the world as a kind of market where , in his words , &quot; that can get what you want &quot; - whether it &apos;s faith or non @-@ belief , hetero@@ gen@@ eity or homosexu@@ ality .
he notes that hardly anyone in Jordan talks about gay rights and les@@ bians and that comments on the equality of LG@@ BT@@ Q + individuals have been cens@@ ored until 2014 .
in 2014 H@@ da@@ i@@ b conducted an interview for the popular Jord@@ anian online program Ro@@ ya , to note that his comments were torn out of context , twisted , and cens@@ ored in his opinion .
&quot; on You@@ tube it was uploaded without any cuts , but stre@@ amed was only a edited version , &quot; he says .
today H@@ da@@ i@@ b is campaig@@ ning for the Arab LG@@ BT@@ Q + community and believes that intoler@@ ance to homosexu@@ als does not dis@@ agree with Islam .
he men@@ tions Abu Nu@@ vo , a poet of the eighth century , still alive thanks to his homo@@ erotic poems .
H@@ da@@ i@@ b asks himself : if Abu Nu@@ eva , who was later working on behalf of the cali@@ ph , could write openly about homosexu@@ ality in the eighth century , why can Jord@@ ani@@ ans not ?
the real problem , so H@@ da@@ i@@ b , has nothing to do with M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ Lei@@ la or the fact that the concert was canc@@ eled .
in the h@@ ash@@ em@@ ian kingdom it is nothing new that the government sanc@@ tioned attacks on freedom of expression and that progressive voices are sil@@ enced .
recently , in January 2017 , the Jord@@ anian Intelligence Service held several former government officials and members of the teachers &apos; association , argu@@ ing that they have critical comments on social media comments related to the corruption that is deeply rooted in the country .
in view of this , H@@ da@@ i@@ bs &apos;s concert is , according to H@@ da@@ i@@ bs &apos;s opinion , only the tip of the ic@@ e@@ berg - the real challenge is to make a structural change in the next generation of the Jord@@ ani@@ ans .
for him , progress is a constant giving and taking . Jordan has now denied M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ Lei@@ la for the second time in a row , but the path of progress - that &apos;s H@@ da@@ i@@ b - consists of slow , thought and inner changes . he is sure that these changes take place from day to day in the heart of Jord@@ anian society .
in the end , like millions of other Arabs , H@@ da@@ i@@ b dreams of an Arab world without intervention from abroad .
he does not only dream of bringing his work to Bag@@ h@@ dad , Jerusalem and Damascus , but also to &quot; experience it . &quot;
perhaps the region will be approached with the help of music , art and literature of genuine and fundamental openness - and not by bombs , scattered uni@@ tions , and artificial kind of demo@@ cra@@ cies . at least he hopes this .
until the time has come , H@@ da@@ i@@ b will continue to ra@@ p and therefore also resist .

Neb@@ uta in A@@ om@@ ori is one of the 3 largest festivals in Japan .
these big , extravag@@ ant warri@@ ors pupp@@ ets are so fantastic ! ! !
there are numerous theories about the origin of the Neb@@ uta festival .
one suppos@@ es that it is a variant of the Tan@@ ab@@ ata Festival , which is usually also celebrated in August in many areas of T@@ oh@@ ok@@ us . another theory states that the trucks , drums and dancing came over more than a thousand years and come from a time when armies from the west of Japan mar@@ ched into the northeast to force the indigenous inhabitants of the region , the emis@@ hi , to the knees .
we are at the Neb@@ uta festival in A@@ om@@ ori .
we were able to grab some great seats , so we have a great view .
one can hardly imagine how big these parts are ...
a community centre in the capital , Meg@@ uro Ga@@ jo@@ en organised a two @-@ month exhibition on W@@ a no Ak@@ ari ( literally ) .
I &apos;ve been looking at the Meg@@ uro Ga@@ jo@@ en for a long time now : two trucks are just to be seen .
nevertheless , for many people who take the trip to A@@ om@@ ori , the Neb@@ uta festival is the only true - and yet another breathtaking way to spend the summer :
&quot; Y@@ att@@ em@@ are !
Y@@ att@@ em@@ are ! &quot; # Summer festival in the north of the country .
I was there and watched the # Neb@@ uch@@ a@@ Festival .
the view of an 18 @-@ metre @-@ high fixed car was incredible .
let &apos;s enjoy the rest of the summer !

rarely outer appearance and body care were as important as in this story , because they help to keep the Peru@@ vian youth out of crime and to promote a legitimate profession like the hair@@ style .
El Call@@ ao , Peru &apos;s most important port , is located on the coast of the Pacific Ocean near the historic center of Lima &apos;s capital , a region with a very high crime rate , where street rob@@ ber@@ y and illegal drug traffi@@ cking are everyday .
a survey published in April 2017 showed that 5@@ 1.5 percent of the population of this region will not feel safe .
at the same time Peru - like many other Central and South American countries - experiences an increasing demand for aesthetic services for men .
the trend to copy the appearance and thus also the unusual hair@@ styles of famous sports@@ men such as Paolo Gu@@ err@@ ero ( Peru ) , Ar@@ tur@@ o Vi@@ dal ( Peru ) , Pedro Gall@@ ese ( Peru ) , or N@@ ey@@ mar ( Brazil ) has led to more and more regular citizens going into the hands of hair@@ dres@@ sers who can recre@@ ate these elaborate hair@@ styles .
the unprecedented demand for hair@@ styles that go to the extreme limits of fantasy and creativity has even inspired an annual event , the competition of hair@@ dres@@ sers &quot; Bat@@ alla de Bar@@ ber@@ os , &quot; which has been held since 2014 .
experts will compete against each other to show who can create the most ec@@ centric looks , as you can see in the following video ( more videos on current competitions on the public Facebook profile Bat@@ alla de Bar@@ ber@@ os ) .
educational institutions such as August@@ o Sal@@ azar Bon@@ dy &apos;s school , located in El Call@@ ao , found an opportunity to persu@@ ade young people to exchange their weapons against hair@@ dres@@ sers and to receive training in hair@@ dres@@ sers instead of poor advice that allows them to find work .
motivated by this activity and offering opportunities , dozens of young people have seen that they can take a job that is currently in fashion .
before the school year beginning in March , the school offered special training workshops and reported on some of its successes :
in 1995 we were the only specialised school in the municipality and the district where we are very proud because we have built up this educational community for love with the children .
Colombia : love letters to guer@@ ri@@ lla fighters
photo : Valent@@ ina Mon@@ sal@@ ve .
use with kind permission .
the following article is the edited version of the &quot; declaration of love for guer@@ ri@@ lla fighters &quot; published by the international online magazine Tea After T@@ wel@@ ve .
the article will be published as part of a partnership with Global Vo@@ ices .
why do we write only love letters to people we know ?
isn &apos;t it much more important to accommodate people who feel pushed out to get affection ?
the young col@@ om@@ bian activ@@ ist Leonardo P@@ Ã¡r@@ ra@@ ga from the Bo@@ got@@ Art Foundation and Cr@@ isti@@ an Pal@@ aci@@ os from Young @-@ Youth Foundation did not leave their heads and inspired them to write letters to the campaign Cart@@ as p@@ or la Rec@@ on@@ ci@@ li@@ aciÃ³n ( letters to reconciliation ) , encouraging young people to write letters to guer@@ ri@@ ll@@ as .
only recently , their country was the scene of a historic event and they wanted to contribute their part : after years of negotiation , the Colom@@ bian government had concluded a peace treaty with the guer@@ ri@@ lla movement F@@ ARC ( German : revolutionary Ar@@ med Forces ) , which forms the conclusion of the longest armed conflict in Latin America .
international recognition of the Peace Treaty was so significant that the Colom@@ bian President JosÃ© Manuel San@@ tos received the Nobel Peace Prize for his mer@@ its .
before Colom@@ bians , however , there is still a long way to speak of genuine reconciliation and peace .
guer@@ ri@@ lla fighters , who have lived in illegal camps for many years , were exposed to war rhet@@ oric and had their arms around the clock , must now re @-@ integrate into life as civilians .
the Colom@@ bian society , in turn , who had become accustomed to life in constant fear and in some cases of deep hatred of guer@@ ri@@ lla fighters , must now take them in their ranks and support them in building a new life .
Leonardo and Cr@@ isti@@ an were convinced that the young Colom@@ bians would join together and help the integration process .
and that &apos;s exactly what they did : until now thousands of young people have already written letters - love messages to former guer@@ ri@@ ll@@ as to welcome them back to society .
the aim of the campaign is 6@@ 900 letters - one for every former guer@@ ri@@ lla fighter - to be handed over personally .
Valent@@ ine &apos;s Day as an inspiration for the campaign
the idea for the letter to reconciliation arose at the World Summit of Nobel Peace Lau@@ re@@ ates , which took place in Bo@@ got@@ Ã¡ in February 2017 . there Leonardo and Cr@@ isti@@ an had the opportunity to briefly speak with K@@ ail@@ ash Sat@@ yar@@ thi , which was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2014 .
he explained that we write thousands of love letters to the people we love on Valent@@ ine &apos;s Day , but forget those who need them much more unnecessary .
he plans to share his love with people this year , who needed the most urgent response .
so the plan arose to write letters full of hope and support to former fighters of the F@@ ARC , who now have to find their place in society and build up a new life . &quot; the letters will show that Colom@@ bian society is ready to make the discourse of a history of war a common history of peace , &quot; they say .
so far more than 2,000 letters have been collected during the campaign .
the initiative is represented in all major cities of Colombia such as Cal@@ i , Man@@ iz@@ ales , Med@@ ell@@ Ã­n , Bar@@ ran@@ qu@@ illa and Bo@@ got@@ Ã¡ .
&apos;@@ i never thought that someone would forgive me &apos;
the first 500 letters were handed over to one of the UN camps in the Cal@@ don@@ o @-@ Cau@@ ca region on 19 March .
a group of 40 students from Ja@@ veri@@ ana University in Cal@@ i , two members of the municipality of Cal@@ i and Leonardo of the Bo@@ got@@ Art Foundation travelled to the camp to personally transfer the letters .
the members of the F@@ ARC set themselves up as they had done before to accept the orders of their leaders .
but this time they did not receive orders , but letters full of support from people from all over the country .
it was a very moving moment for everyone involved . &quot; it &apos;s unbelievable how many different feelings one can go through in just a few hours - from fear to happiness and everything in between , &quot; told Manu@@ ela Jim@@ Ã©@@ ne@@ z A@@ vil@@ a later .
Sandra Par@@ ra , a member of the governor of the province of Valle del Cau@@ ca , described this unforgettable experience :
after comm@@ itting the letters , a former fighter led me through the camp of guer@@ ri@@ lla fighters .
when I looked into one of the &quot; Cam@@ bu@@ ches &quot; ( a kind of hut in which the guer@@ ri@@ lla fighters live ) I saw a guer@@ ri@@ lla fighter who wrote something .
I was afraid to go down , because next to him on the bed was a M@@ GL gr@@ en@@ ade , a deadly weapon in the Sle@@ eping Beauty Sle@@ eping .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I answered and said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; H@@ ello , what are they doing right now ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I answer a letter to me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is a very nice and hop@@ eful letter .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have never written so much in my life , so I answer it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; suddenly tears ran across the che@@ eks . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I hu@@ gged him quite firmly , and sat down beside the pom@@ eg@@ ran@@ ates .
perhaps he was tired of the war , he was tired of being all the years of the faithful companion of this warri@@ or , and wanted to help him write this letter .
the man told me more about his life . he had never expected anything else from life than war . joining the F@@ ARC was the only way to save him and his six brothers before star@@ vation . &quot; I never thought anybody would forgive me for my mistakes .
but now I know that there is a society out there waiting for us with open arms .
until now I have only learned how to deal with weapons .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but now where peace reig@@ ns I can learn many things and work in dignity . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
new Vo@@ ices
at the start of the event , students and some leaders of the F@@ ARC met for a discussion round .
the students were all grown up as already there was war and the F@@ ARC already acted in secret .
for this reason , the leaders of the F@@ ARC declared the history of the organization , their ideals , and gave insight into their views on the peace process : &quot; for many years we have experienced how social injustice done on the part of the whole Colom@@ bian people . now , where we have the opportunity to develop into a political party , we can help shape society more just in this country .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for a goal of this magnitude , it is worthwhile to overcome all obstacles , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said one of them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Manu@@ ela was impressed :
to hear those people who had never found a hearing and had no right to vote , and to recognize that the people I have often seen and hated as monsters , even those with beautiful feelings that were turned around by their circumstances and their environment , was very painful for me .
the reality in which the country is living hur@@ ts me .
but it comforts me that all people - including those who have killed and caused so much damage , can teach us something and give a smile and a hu@@ g .
many former fighters responded to the letters .
Gust@@ av@@ o Gon@@ z@@ Ã¡@@ lez , the commander of the camp in Cal@@ don@@ o @-@ Cau@@ ca , wrote for example Dar@@ Ã­@@ o de Jes@@ Ãº@@ s Mon@@ sal@@ ve , Archbishop of the city of Cal@@ i , the following letter :
the Colom@@ bian was prophes@@ ied that after dis@@ ar@@ ming would reign peace .
but this is not the case .
as long as there is ine@@ quality , hunger and lack of education , health care and employment opportunities , there will always be people who are ready to take arms , rise up and protest for their rights . and this is also completely justified ( ... ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we of the F@@ ARC are now on peace , on a policy without weapons . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
that is why we call on all def@@ enders of peace - no matter what race , religion or ideology they belong to - to rise above all those who dream of a country in war .
we give you our word , make our contribution and offer sacrifices , because we know from our own experience that nothing is simple . those of us who defend life as the basis of existence will face many difficulties .
on our way there will be many obstacles , but together we will overcome them .
a Trans@@ man talks about the persec@@ utions in Ch@@ echn@@ ya and life in front of Kad@@ y@@ rov

this is the translation of an article written by our partner Ai@@ da Mir@@ mak@@ eup and whose first publication took place on the OC Media website .
hom@@ os@@ exual and qu@@ eer people living in the Cau@@ cas@@ us region face a wide range of dangers - including discrimination , physical and sexual violence and black@@ mail .
with terror activists have witnessed the reporting of the last months about the persecution of gay men in Ch@@ echn@@ ya .
but the threat that hangs like a women &apos;s sword over the local LG@@ BT@@ Q community has not been created overnight .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; OC Media had the opportunity to talk to a trans@@ sexual woman from Gro@@ z@@ ny who shared some of her experiences with us and talked to us about what is happening in the Republic . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the LG@@ BT@@ Q legal situation in Ch@@ echn@@ ya has conquered international head@@ lines several months ago after reports have been published that addressed the dra@@ gging , torture and killing of qu@@ eer men in the Republic .
the first report was published by journalist Elena Mil@@ asch@@ ina in the Now@@ aya Gaz@@ eta ; she threw a light on the methods of Che@@ chen authorities who arrested suspi@@ cious qu@@ eer men and put them in secret pris@@ ons in ar@@ gun .
&quot; you have brought a monster to the world &quot;
Sab@@ rina , a trans@@ man , was born in Gro@@ z@@ ny and grew up there .
she already felt that she was a woman in reality .
when she grew up , she became aware that Ch@@ echn@@ ya was not a sure place for her , which was why she moved to Moscow .
after experiencing a group of Ch@@ ech@@ ens from the sex equ@@ ation of their coun@@ try@@ woman , the hunt was opened on Sab@@ rina .
in the last analysis , she went into the USA out of fear of her life .
Sab@@ rina : I worked as a volunteer hel@@ per in a human rights organisation .
one day I was told that someone needed my help .
it was a friend from Da@@ gest@@ an , a trans@@ man who was in trouble .
she had no money , so I took her without hes@@ itation .
while I tried to help her , someone from whom I thought he would be a friend , a copy of my documents and spread them anywhere on the internet , with my phone number and a picture of me . he sent them to his Che@@ chen friends , with the following message : &quot; then there are no more men in Ch@@ echn@@ ya that can eliminate this shame ? &quot;
after that , the photos from my documents made the round by W@@ hat@@ s@@ App .
on 10 October 2015 I was attacked .
when I was doing a few shopping bags from the back seat of my car , I heard a male voice saying : &quot; here &apos;s a gift for you from your unc@@ le . &quot;
when I turned around , I felt something in my body , but I did not hurt .
then I heard a sentence , but this time in Ch@@ echn@@ ya : &quot; how long will you still honor the family , you sc@@ and@@ stain ? &quot;
I did not know the person .
I just know that it was a young man , not thirty years old .
then I lost consciousness and eventually woke up at the hospital .
apparently some women had all got along and started scre@@ aming .
the man had fled .
the women had called an ambul@@ ance .
in the hospital I learned that I had two stit@@ ches in my right lung .
OC Media : in which wings were you placed - in which of men or women ?
Sab@@ rina : my documents are dated , there is still my male name on it ; but the doctor understood and put me to the women .
for this I am very grateful to him .
when I read his name for the first time at his office door , I was afraid to do it ; it was a Muslim , a Cau@@ ca@@ sian name .
but he turned out to be a good person .
I am grateful to him that he is respect@@ ful with me .
I spent more than a month in hospital .
last February I received threats .
they called me , wrote me - relatives , strangers , some completely unknown .
this was the beginning of a night@@ mare .
my family was visited by neighbors and some distant relatives .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they asked me to return to Ch@@ echn@@ ya in order to prove that it was all a lie . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they made absurd demands : some told me that I had to prove it by going up without through the streets ; others wanted me to appear on official TV in Gro@@ z@@ ny and say that I didn &apos;t change my sex that everything was just bad , and Phot@@ os@@ hop .
I have grain size C - what would I have to say on TV ?
OC Media : how did your family try to deal with this pressure ?
Sab@@ rina : it &apos;s still hard for them .
some elderly people once spoke to my mother on the street .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they said to her , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; They have brought a monster to the world , which has not only broken your family but the entire republic . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we cannot touch you because you are a pi@@ ous woman but you must disappear from here . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was too much for my mother and she put a rope around her neck .
fortunately the neighbors came and saved them .
at that time I had to change the apartment several times a day .
I moved to an apartment and a few hours later there was a car with a dark@@ ened window and a number plate with a 95 .
after it happened the third time it became clear to me that something was la@@ zy .
my Human Rights friends reviewed the license plates - it turned out that I was persecuted .
OC Media : how did you flee ?
Sab@@ rina : with the help of activists .
for security reasons I don &apos;t want to reveal their names , but I want to say that I remember them all ; they really helped me .
with their help I left the country , but then something unbelievable happened .
I can still not understand how it could be .
shortly before my departure from Moscow I bought a new SIM card to call my mother as soon as I arrived .
I bought them without registering , without reference , without anything .
I broke my old SIM card and threw it into the tr@@ ash .
arrived and checked in at the hotel .
the number was registered for a stranger .
I put the SIM card into my mobile phone .
in the moment I wanted to call my mother to W@@ hat@@ s@@ App , I got a message : &quot; you don &apos;t think you &apos;re in security , just because you left the country ?
our people know in which hotel you are in . you even know your room number .
just to prove it to you : it is number 115 . &quot;
can you imagine that ? !
this was actually my room number .
OC Media : are you still in contact with your family ?
Sab@@ rina : only with my mother and my sisters .
but we don &apos;t talk about gender equality , that &apos;s a t@@ abo@@ o topic .
I still carry some traditionally Cau@@ ca@@ sian elements in me .
as much as I wish , I cannot overcome this mental barrier .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I always say that as long as my mother is alive , I will do my best to avoid hur@@ ting her . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
when we chat with camera , I actually try to figure out how the person looks from her past - so to my male form .
but that is very difficult .
OC Media : do you know about the current situation in Ch@@ echn@@ ya ?
what do your friends do , those who have stayed there ?
Sab@@ rina : I submitted a report last week in Washington .
for this I needed topical information about the situation in Ch@@ echn@@ ya .
I talked to someone who sat in ar@@ gun for one and a half months .
he told us that during Ram@@ adan , no people were arrested and tor@@ tured , but also that all the end of Ram@@ adan could hardly wait , and he did not exclude a new wave .
most likely they will now focus on family and relatives .
with this I mean , they probably invite the relatives , these take care of the problem with the affected person and at the end require proof that the so @-@ called &quot; honor &quot; has experienced through blood satisfaction .
OC Media : are gay men still being det@@ ained in these secret pris@@ ons ?
Sab@@ rina : a friend of mine says there are not so many .
if , then , especially those who have no wealthy relatives or who were dropped by their relatives in order to face Kad@@ y@@ rows &apos;s court .
as far as I know , they are held there to present them later as terrorists .
say : if they are killed , they will show their bodies on TV and claim they had attacked any village or military base .
do you understand ?
as if these people were not simply disappeared , but deliberately immersed in order to radic@@ alise themselves .
OC Media : is this just a guess or do you have a source for this information ?
Sab@@ rina : I just quote someone who was imprisoned for one and a half months in ar@@ gun .
he says that many people have disappeared in this prison after having grown beard .
there was nothing new from them since then .
they simply took them along .
and this so @-@ called Lord , that person was himself when these people were taken along .
until now , however , they were not presented as ban@@ dits , there were no reports about that yet . we assume however that such actions are quite possible .
why else would it not have allowed these people to shave ?
do you know if these persec@@ utions and kidn@@ app@@ ings of people belonging to a so @-@ called &quot; non @-@ traditional &quot; orientation have already taken place in the past ?
Sab@@ rina : I &apos;ve always wore my hair long .
in Ch@@ echn@@ ya I had a Bob .
I think that before 2003 I was already known in Gro@@ sn@@ y when I was still living there - and I never had any problems .
seriously !
even from 1998 to 1999 , when the sh@@ aria was considered , I never had any problems .
on the contrary , it was much safer than now .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Russia originally intended to bring us to the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; civil@@ isation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; but ultimately threw us back into the stone age . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
OC Media : how is this possible under the Sch@@ aria law ?
Sab@@ rina : my ey@@ eb@@ rows were plu@@ cked ; I had dy@@ ed lashes , wore tubes jeans and short tops .
the Ministry of Safety of Sh@@ aria has never touched me just a hair .
in front of the Russian Theatre in Gro@@ z@@ ny there was a place where every evening , especially on weekends , there met a whole group of people like me .
it was a small place where several banks were standing , and the whole city knew about it ; they knew why men , young people , met there .
we were never offen@@ ded .
in the Che@@ chen language there is a saying : K@@ har@@ da ma K@@ har@@ da . that is : &quot; mock not about mis@@ fortune of another . &quot;
it is often said to be children when people make fun of the sick .
OC Media : so they simply shut their eyes before you , because they believed they were ill ?
Sab@@ rina : yes .
they never insul@@ ted me , never ch@@ ased nor beaten .
OC Media : how long did this time of grace stop ?
Sab@@ rina : as long as Kad@@ y@@ row entered the plan .
when he was appointed prime minister in 2005 , he began to talk about morality on television .
he did not speak about us per se , but mainly about the behaviour of women .
nevertheless - one could feel how people began to change in the city .
those who had laugh@@ ed and laugh@@ ed before looked at you at once with suspicion .
in time I left Ch@@ echn@@ ya .
but every time I came back home I could feel how the situation in the Republic deterior@@ ated steadily .
OC Media : what activity do you follow now ?
Sab@@ rina : I work as a wa@@ it@@ ress .
I don &apos;t earn much - 700 to 800 dollars a month are not much in the US .
apart from that , I am still active as an activ@@ ist .
currently I am responsible for 15 Muslim women .
I communicate with them as a kind of psych@@ ologist .
we organize te@@ ac@@ re@@ ffs , gather@@ ings , I es@@ cor@@ t them to the hospital and help them to get food cards .
I don &apos;t have a p@@ enny for it for a long time .
I discovered these people by myself when I ab@@ used refu@@ ges .
I am Muslims and I want to help those who need help .
OC Media : do you wear a Hid@@ de@@ ab ?
Sab@@ rina : this is sil@@ ly .
so nature is , it has nothing to do with religion .
this is exactly the same as Ch@@ et@@ sch@@ enen , who want to make you white with foam before the mouth , that there are no wa@@ ils with them .
the Da@@ gest@@ ans have which , the cab@@ ar@@ ers , have which , the Russians have also which ; on the whole planet they exist - but &quot; not in Ch@@ echn@@ ya . &quot;
I come from there , so it &apos;s unpleasant to hear something like that .
I meet so many men from the Cau@@ cas@@ us here .
many of them - practicing Muslims who go to the mos@@ que and fast during Ram@@ adan - live together with men .
you know many think of transition to men who love men , and they believe that you change your sex to make more intimate experiences . but that &apos;s a fall@@ acy .
these are two different things - two different types of feeling to be exact , different attitudes of life .
for me it is the most important thing to feel in my own skin and not to be ashamed of my body .
not if I have a partner or not .
I &apos;m sorry I &apos;m going to be so personal here , but my last intimate relationship is now longer than a year ago .
and I &apos;m not sad at all - I just know that I am now myself .
local groups warn against an increase of suicide among the im@@ pover@@ ished Arab Ah@@ ra@@ zi community in Iran
the Iranian Ah@@ ra@@ z region suffers from an un@@ usually high unemployment and poverty rate within the native Arab population .
since the last few months there has been a sharp rise in suicide .
the photo of the Arab workers in Iran was provided by the Patri@@ otic Arab Democratic Movement in Ah@@ wa@@ z .
photo : use with permission .
the self @-@ burning of a man named J@@ assi@@ m Mor@@ amaz@@ i on August 27th drew the desperate situation of the Arab Ah@@ wa@@ zi community in Iran , which is marked by poverty and unemployment , into the li@@ mel@@ i@@ ght .
Mor@@ amaz@@ i was married and had a child ; he lived in Al @-@ Tha@@ w@@ ra in the Ah@@ wa@@ z region in the south @-@ west of Iran .
he suffered from anxiety , depression , and he was ashamed of his own hel@@ pl@@ essness , inability to pay for his family , so Ah@@ wa@@ zi human rights groups who want to work in Ah@@ wa@@ z and remain anonymous .
a video shared to YouTube was holding the moments when he had lighted himself .
some people quickly managed to extingu@@ ish the flames , and Mor@@ amaz@@ i was brought to the Tal@@ e@@ gh@@ ani hospital in the city of Ah@@ wa@@ z .
according to local sources , the burns were so strong that the doctors could not do anything more .
he died shortly thereafter .
it was not the only suicide that happened in August within the Arab Ah@@ ra@@ zi Min@@ ority , and activists on site warn that even more men could take life .
the Ah@@ ra@@ zi Centre for Human Rights reported that this month some others - Ham@@ id Mani@@ at , Ali Haz@@ ba@@ wi , S@@ ayed Fal@@ ah M@@ ous@@ sa@@ wi and Sha@@ hab Ban@@ i Tam@@ im - hang@@ ed .
their stories have one thing in common : they were all family patri@@ arch@@ s who felt hel@@ pless and unable to feed their families because of persecution on the part of the Iranian government , and to pursue a safe work .
Arab Ah@@ wa@@ zi are suffering from poverty , unemployment and discrimination
the region in which a large part of the Arab Ah@@ ra@@ zi community living in Iran has been shaken by a profound economic crisis that makes it hard for the local Arab population to make a living .
a century ago , the Arab Ah@@ wa@@ z was a predominantly autonomous region in Iran until the P@@ ah@@ lav@@ i monarchy assumed power and under@@ took great efforts in 1925 to end ethnic autonomy throughout Iran .
in the Ah@@ ra@@ z region , there are some of the largest oil and gas fields occurring in Iran , as well as some of the most profitable and valuable arable land for Iranian agriculture .
despite these valuable resources , the regional economy continues to develop slowly , and the local population gets little from this wealth .
it is often a victim of ill @-@ treated diseases , hunger and priv@@ ations .
the Iranian regime will systematically deny the Ah@@ wa@@ zi Arabs work in the local oil , gas and petro@@ chemical industries .
the government has also built a large number of dam@@ s to re@@ direct the water from the Arabic regions to the Persian territories , where the provinces of Is@@ f@@ ah@@ an , Y@@ az@@ d , Ker@@ man and G@@ ho@@ m lie .
these dam@@ s have only led to ag@@ grav@@ ating the devast@@ ation caused by drought , and destroying local agriculture as well as the fish and palm industry .
the unemployment rate among the Arab A@@ haw@@ k young@@ sters increased to 81 % .
N@@ our Mohammed P@@ ur , Iranian Director General for Co@@ operative , Labour and Social Wel@@ fare , reported that 5 % of Ah@@ wa@@ z@@ is who are looking for a job completed primary school , completed 55 % of secondary school and 45 % graduated from university .
a &quot; systematic strategy ... aimed at destroying the spirit of national resistance &quot;
Kar@@ im Do@@ him@@ i , an Iranian Ah@@ ra@@ zi human rights activ@@ ist with residence in London , told Global Vo@@ ices that the current situation , a mixture of &quot; poverty , unemployment and rac@@ ist ethnic discrimination &quot; leads to a &quot; high rise &quot; of the number of suicide among young Ah@@ wa@@ zi men .
the reason for this is a combination of a high number of ethnic Persian and an anti @-@ Arab discrimination in the recruitment process :
since officials and institutions prefer not to employ Arab workers , the local Arab Ah@@ wa@@ zi is deprived of access to employment opportunities in all sectors .
this is part of a systematic policy of the ruling regime , aimed at anni@@ hil@@ ating the spirit of national resistance by young Arabs and forcing them to earn their living outside their home of Ah@@ wa@@ z .
there are people who have had to change their first and last name to hide their affili@@ ation with the Ah@@ wa@@ zi and be hired as even Arab names are not tolerated at the workplace , let alone speak Arabic language or wearing Arabic clothing .
given the given circumstances that the Arab Ah@@ wa@@ zi have to endure , human rights activists beat alert before the situation becomes explosive .
it remains to be seen whether the world is awake and aware of it .
the main reason for suicide is untreated depression .
depression is treat@@ able and suicide is avoid@@ able .

&quot; why I don &apos;t identify with femin@@ ism , even with the inter@@ sec@@ tion@@ als &quot;
detail of a photo . recorded by Pix@@ el@@ ay . published under the CC@@ 0 Creative Com@@ mons License .
the following article is a revised version of the statement written by Ay@@ om@@ ide Zur@@ i and originally published on the A@@ fro@@ f@@ Ã©@@ min@@ as website .
you can read in the comments below the original text .
when I say that I am not a feminist , many women - especially white women who call themselves as inter@@ sec@@ tional fem@@ inists - react with fru@@ stration .
they wonder why I am not part of the movement .
they even put well thought @-@ out scientific and social arguments before me why I should be feminist and why we should generally be all feminist * within .
for example , women still earn less money in spite of equal education than men .
that women are still under strict observation when it comes to what they are allowed to do with their bodies .
violence against women is a global epide@@ mic .
or that cultural and social norms will still make sure that women come across a glass ceiling sooner or later in various spheres of life , and that discrimination based on gender is still moving across the many different countries and beliefs .
all of this is aware and known to me .
I am convinced , and I suffer twice and thre@@ ef@@ old .
I am a black woman .
and yet , when I come to speak on skin colour , on rac@@ ism , on black women &apos;s women , on black women in the LG@@ B@@ TI@@ Q community or on black women from the Dias@@ por@@ a ; if I mention how we have always been ab@@ used in racial se@@ gregation and discrimination , both in and outside the feminist movement , many white fem@@ inists decide to remain silent .
but they all agree that women - all women - should come together to &quot; up@@ lift their voices and to &quot; sing Kum@@ ba@@ ya , my Lord , &quot; in order to achieve equal rights ( some ) of women .
but they do not want to talk about the fact that sexu@@ alised violence , in addition to sexu@@ alised violence , gives a institution@@ alized form of rac@@ ist @-@ motivated violence , which we are exposed to black women in a tw@@ o@@ fold manner .
or that black women and women of other eth@@ ni@@ cities and places of origin earn less than white men and women .
that black girls and girls with a migration background are more often referred to as white girls , due to obvious integration problems .
or that women in black spheres and women with a migration background are exposed to higher risk to suffer domestic violence and violence in partnership than white women .
on the one hand , I want all women , all men and all men of any skin color have the same rights ; on the other hand , I can &apos;t join a movement in whose centre the white woman stands who refuses to take into account injustice in her mind , which relate to both the sex and the skin color of a person .
I am exhausted and will no longer fight for my affili@@ ation in a white @-@ feminist @-@ oriented sphere that has always and repeatedly rejected me and countless other black women .
in 18@@ 51 , So@@ jour@@ ner compl@@ ained in her speech : &quot; am I not a woman ? &quot; and I also refuse to uph@@ old an ideology in which the black woman in historical regard is a de@@ human@@ ly and margin@@ alized being .
I refuse to join groups which also absorb our customs and customs through cultural appropri@@ ation to promote their ego@@ centric agenda .
for some of them will continue to hold the importance of black women for the feminist movement , no matter how many black women try to teach them for the better .
although Inter@@ sec@@ tion@@ ale Femin@@ ism was founded to give women of different backgrounds a home and distinguish themselves from white femin@@ ism , still the word &quot; femin@@ ism &quot; is still in its name .
I prefer to release myself entirely from femin@@ ism and join the movement of the W@@ om@@ an@@ ism created for my dark skin and my status as a woman , rather than using me for a white @-@ feminist paradigm that is so persistent that inter@@ sec@@ tion@@ ality is celebrated as a novel phenomenon .
now it is more important than ever that we define black women according to our own ideas and move into the spheres that are created by us for us .
Cl@@ enor@@ a Hudson @-@ We@@ ems , the author of the book Afri@@ can@@ a wom@@ an@@ ism : claims ( such as : Africa @-@ W@@ om@@ an@@ ism : how we ourselves rec@@ ap@@ ture ourselves ) speaks of that we can defend ourselves by defining ourselves in our own way . and not only that - black women can also create spaces in which they are completely safe and in which the cultural , mental , psychological , physical and even the spiritual elements can be worshipped which make up the black woman .
although some white and inter@@ sec@@ tional fem@@ inists will immediately call separ@@ atism and exclusion after reading these lines , I ask you to inform yourself about the hypo@@ cris@@ y and the contradictions of the feminist movement , of which the black woman is affected .
in a wom@@ an@@ istic environment I can lift up black women and women of other cultures , because in this paradigm I exist .
I am recognized as a part of this paradigm because of my dark skin and because of my existence as a woman .
I , a black woman , can flour@@ ish in an environment in which my life is neither ignored nor ignored nor rejected .
p@@ add@@ ling against pollution : a man &apos;s mission to protect the rivers in Iraq for future generations
this contribution by To@@ dd Reu@@ bold was originally published on En@@ si@@ a.com , a magazine that reports in@@ particular about international efforts to solve environmental problems .
in the context of a content sharing agreement , this article will be published again .
in the past 7 years , Nab@@ il Mus@@ a traveled to Iraq , mostly with sur@@ f@@ boards or in can@@ oe . his mission is to make people aware of the importance of clean waters for present and future generations .
in this documentation of E@@ mil@@ y Kin@@ sk@@ ey we follow Mus@@ a , who explains his relationship with the rivers of the region and the impact of pollution on his church .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I really wanted to do something for the river that we had lost when I was a child , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Mus@@ a . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
scientists from all over the country fear that the decades of war , construction of dam@@ s , pollution and un@@ controlled development lead to a direct water crisis in Iraq .
Mus@@ a is a member of the Water@@ R@@ Iraq Non @-@ Govern@@ mental Organization - a subsidiary of Water@@ borne Alliance - committed to protecting the rivers , streams and water@@ ways in Iraq , as well as supporting local communities in the sustainable use of these natural resources . &quot;
at the end of the video , Mus@@ a sum@@ mar@@ ises the ur@@ gency and importance of his work in a question : &quot; if we had no water , how would we survive ? &quot;
this video was produced , filmed and published for En@@ sia by E@@ mil@@ y Kin@@ sk@@ ey , an Er@@ bil , Iraq @-@ based documentary film and multimedia journalist .
the focus of her work lies on persecuted , little noticed sub@@ cultures and is characterized by the use of cooperative vide@@ ography and new multimedia techniques , with whose help supp@@ ressed churches can tell their stories in their own way .
Paragu@@ ay@@ an women and their difficult fight against violence
a group of women portra@@ y &quot; the crying women &quot; in order to express their sorrow on the women &apos;s mur@@ ders in the country and in the region and show their rejection .

the following article is the shortened and edited version of the article &quot; The wave of violence against women in Paraguay &quot; by structural . the article belongs to the series # Por@@ ser@@ Mu@@ j@@ er ( # consec@@ lich@@ ein@@ ef@@ rau@@ bin ) , which reports about the violence against women in Paraguay .
most names have been changed to protect the persons affected .
a police comm@@ iss@@ ar told A@@ da B@@ Ã¡@@ ez that she could do nothing against Luis Bal@@ bu@@ ena , her ex @-@ partner , who had been violent against her .
since the end of their relationship some time had passed and the police said their statement would be put to the files , but more could not be done .
when another wife Bal@@ bu@@ ena showed suspicion because of mal@@ treatment , A@@ da B@@ Ã¡@@ ez &apos;s ad @-@ sk@@ inn@@ ed display of A@@ da B@@ Ã¡@@ ez was no av@@ ail .
a few days later , the second woman returned her ad .
breaking the vi@@ cious circle of violence against women is difficult .
if women complain at all , they generally do not receive support from the State .
in many cases , women are also financially dependent on the men who abuse them . this also explains why only 20 % of all women who admit to be victims of violence should report at all to the law enforcement agencies .
contents 1 Stri@@ ke and Statisti@@ cal 2 In@@ visible mi@@ stre@@ at@@ ations and a legal system that nothing sub@@ mis@@ ses Paragu@@ ay@@ an &apos;s laws : good approach , poor implementation impacts and statistics
it is hard to determine how many women are really ill @-@ treated , says My@@ rian Gon@@ z@@ Ã¡@@ lez , a researcher for gender issues at the Centro de Docum@@ ent@@ aciÃ³n y E@@ studios , a social scientific research institution in Paraguay . &quot; there are different statements and reports that do not even show the extent of gender @-@ specific violence against women in Paraguay , &quot; she explains .
the available figures , however , are alar@@ ming .
in 2015 , 9@@ 600 advertisements for domestic violence took place at the District At@@ tor@@ ney Office . 70 % of it revol@@ ved around violence against women .
86 % of the ads used by the police came from women .
there were more than 5,000 adver@@ ts due to domestic violence in the Peace Cour@@ ts . 86 % of women &apos;s advertisements came here as well .
in the advertisements 40 % of women said that they were physically ab@@ used , 55 % of women spoke of psychological abuse .
these statistics however do not show the true extent of violence against women in Paraguay .
according to the Paragu@@ ay@@ an women &apos;s minister Ana Bai@@ ardi , only a few of these crimes are actually shown . &quot; on every woman ref@@ unded in Paraguay because of psychological abuse , 9 women who do not .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the end of 2014 , two women who do not do this are entitled to any woman who is ref@@ unded because of physical abuse . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
since women &apos;s hom@@ icide in Paraguay is not an individual criminal off@@ ence , the law enforcement agencies cannot appropriately document how many women are murdered every year by their current or former partners .
by August 2016 alone , journalists counted at least 12 cases of women &apos;s murder in the country .
the coordinator for human rights in Paraguay documented at least 37 cases where women were murdered by their current or former partners .
according to their estimates , in Paraguay every ten days dies a woman because of violence by men .

invisible mi@@ stre@@ at@@ ment and a judicial system that under@@ takes nothing
before Mari@@ ana Br@@ Ã­@@ te@@ z became the firm friend of Carlos Vera , he insi@@ sted that she called him the names of all her former friends .
in the beginning she didn &apos;t want it , but then gave up . this should always regret her .
today Mari@@ ana is 28 years old and no longer together with Carlos . but for two years she bore the psych@@ ic violence , one of the most common forms of violence against women and at the same time the most recognis@@ able :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I never thought I would once become victims of abuse . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
when I read about it earlier , I always thought that this only happened to women who are too sub@@ mis@@ sive because they let themselves be deceived by violent men .
I was convinced that this would never happen to me .
Mari@@ ana used social media to report about abuse by Carlos Vera .
without nam@@ ing a name , she wrote posts on Facebook , in which she described his insul@@ ts and various attacks during her two @-@ year relationship and told how he had isolated them .
many people responded to their contributions , including Carlos himself . he asked rhet@@ or@@ ically whether he had ever raised his hand against them and refused to confess that his behaviour was also a form of abuse .
other Facebook users asked Mari@@ ana why she had liked it so long by Carlos and did not leave him earlier .
it seemed almost as if they wanted to say that victims of abuse had at least a certain complic@@ ity .
Victoria San@@ tos , who did not come from Paraguay , fought almost eight years with the authorities in Paraguay to prove that their former partner ab@@ used them .
Victoria is a member of the network Y@@ o te Cre@@ o ( &quot; I believe you &quot; ) consisting of women who are all victims of abuse in any way .
in the group they can talk to others about their experiences , listen to each other and support each other .
they do what many others do not do : they take the statements of women seriously .
in Victori@@ as case everything started with mental abuse .
her wealthy partner even managed to convince her that she was worth@@ less .
then he began to beat them .
they did not support Victori@@ as advertisements with the authorities without a result and also from their relatives .
she led a trial against her former partner , who developed into an un@@ predictable legal struggle between Paraguay and her native country in which it was mainly about money , power and the influence of her former partner .
Paragu@@ ays laws : good approach , poor implementation
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Paraguay there are many laws that are very good but are not used . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the show of abuse is a road full of resistance and a fight against corruption in the judi@@ ci@@ ary , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Victoria San@@ tos . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Carmen Ech@@ au@@ ri , a representative of the UN organisation for women in Paraguay , also sees great problems in applying the laws in the country .
on 10 August 2016 , a bill was discussed at the Par@@ agu@@ ay@@ an Parliament , which was known under the h@@ ash@@ tag # Por@@ el@@ as ( # 1 ) .
this h@@ ash@@ tag and the # Ni@@ Un@@ a@@ Men@@ os movement ( # failure ) are part of a campaign on Twitter that is supported by Am@@ nesty International .
the original draft of the law stipul@@ ates that Fem@@ izi@@ d becomes an independent criminal off@@ ence and punish him harder as it is already in the neighbouring countries of Argentina and Bolivia .
thus the bill was changed in some points to win the de@@ pu@@ ties for the law , which feared that the way for de@@ crimin@@ alisation of abor@@ tions would be paved , which are banned in Paraguay up to five years imprisonment .
the original draft bill envis@@ aged the majority of the ( bureaucratic and economic ) proced@@ ural costs which the victims of violence need to bear even if they simply want to submit an adver@@ t and receive a safe housing to impose the state .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ech@@ au@@ ri ar@@ gues that the law is not effective if the legislature does not provide sufficient funds for it : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in Paraguay , abuse is seen as part of inter@@ personal relationships .
here a re@@ thinking has to take place , so that violence can no longer be viewed as something normal .
those who are silent in the face of these facts are complic@@ it and contribute to the offen@@ se of the perpetr@@ ators .
we must reimbur@@ se for such a long time until mi@@ stre@@ at@@ ment is no longer considered normal .
on 10 November 2016 , the law was passed in the Paragu@@ ay@@ an Senate . prior to that , parts of the law were changed , among other things a passage that the partners called for reconciliation in cases of domestic violence .
the opinions on the changes go apart .
the section on Rec@@ on@@ ci@@ liation has been seen as an opportunity for the aggres@@ sor to attack his victim again .
the submission of the words &quot; sex , &quot; &quot; political violence &quot; and &quot; sexual har@@ ass@@ ment &quot; from parts of the law , however , is regarded as a great set@@ back .

independent media in Oman one year after the ban of a newspaper continues to attack attacks
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this website was blocked by a resolution of the Minister of Information &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is read on the website of the forbidden newspaper Az@@ am@@ n . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
more than a year ago , the Romanian authorities closed the independent Arab @-@ language newspaper Az@@ am@@ n because of their reporting on corruption in the sul@@ tan@@ te .
You@@ se@@ f Al @-@ Ha@@ j , one of the editors of the newspaper , is still in prison , where he is serving a year@@ long prison term .
two other editors of Az@@ am@@ n , I@@ bra@@ him Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari and Zah@@ er Al @-@ A@@ br@@ i , were also arrested and tried in court but later released .
Oman has been governed by Sultan Q@@ ab@@ us i@@ bn S@@ aid since 1970 , who came to power after having served his father , S@@ aid i@@ bn Ta@@ im@@ ur , by a coup d &quot; Ã©@@ tat .
since then , in addition to his role as the sul@@ tan , the main mini@@ stries in the country : Prime Minister , Minister of Defence , Supreme Commander of the Ar@@ med Forces , Finance Minister , Foreign Minister , President of the Supreme Council for Planning and President of the Central Bank .
the Sul@@ t@@ ans rule is marked by the persistent efforts of the security forces , especially of domestic sec@@ rec@@ y , restric@@ ting public freedom , including freedom of the press , and torture human rights def@@ enders , independent journalists , blo@@ ggers and other activists to in@@ timi@@ date and incar@@ cer@@ ate .
the authorities systematically limit peaceful and legitimate activities in the area of human rights and prevent citizens , even activists , to express their views on public affairs such as corruption in authorities and institutions both online and offline .
the attack on the newspaper Az@@ am@@ n , its closure and the detention of three of its editors last year is a hard blow to press freedom in the country .
Az@@ am@@ n is an independent newspaper published since its inc@@ eption in 2007 on corruption in Oman ( an absolute monarchy ) until it was banned by the authorities in August 2016 .
on 28 July 2016 , security forces I@@ bra@@ him Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari , editor @-@ in @-@ chief of Az@@ am@@ n , announced that an article entitled &quot; High @-@ ranking parties bind hands to justice &quot; was published in the newspaper on 26 July 2016 .
in the report , government officials were accused of having put pressure on judges of the Supreme Court in Oman to raise a verdict in a dispute .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; issue of the newspaper Az@@ am@@ n of July 26 , 2016 with a report on the title page with the title : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; high @-@ ranking parties bind hands to justice . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

on August 3 , 2016 , Zah@@ er Al @-@ A@@ br@@ i , Member of the Editorial Board , was invited by the ISS for the special department and arrested by the security forces upon his arrival .
on 9 August 2016 , the ISS arrested the deputy editor @-@ in @-@ chief You@@ se@@ f Al @-@ Ha@@ j , who had acted as chief editor after Al @-@ Ma@@ amar@@ is &apos;s arrest .
the paper was closed in@@ definitely after the Minister of Information had given the instruction that &quot; publication and dis@@ semination of the paper on any means , including online , was banned from August 9 , 2016 . &quot;
on 26 September 2016 , the first trial of the trial against Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari , Al @-@ Ha@@ j and Al @-@ A@@ br@@ i took place in Mas@@ k@@ at .
the court sentenced the three journalists to prison terms and ordered the final closure of the newspaper .
al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari and Al @-@ Ha@@ j were both convic@@ ted of distur@@ b@@ ance of public order , &quot; mis@@ use of the internet , &quot; and &quot; under@@ mining the state of the state . &quot;
in addition , Al @-@ Ha@@ j was found guilty of the violation of a ban on publication and the slan@@ der .
al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari and Al @-@ Ha@@ j were sentenced to three years of imprisonment and fin@@ es in the amount of 3,000 om@@ ani@@ ac@@ al ri@@ al ( 7@@ 800 US dollars ) .
al @-@ A@@ br@@ i was sentenced to a year of imprisonment and a fine of 1000 Ri@@ al ( 26@@ 00 US dollars ) after he was found guilty of the use of an information network to dissemin@@ ate material that could pose a threat to public order .
for Al @-@ A@@ br@@ i , a security deposit of 5000 om@@ ani ri@@ al ( 13@@ ,000 US dollars ) was set and he was released on 22 August 2016 before the pron@@ ounc@@ ement of the sentence .
the Appe@@ als Court acqu@@ itted Al @-@ A@@ br@@ i in a hearing on 26 December 2016 , but sentenced Al @-@ Ha@@ j to six months in prison for one year and Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari .
al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari was released on 10 April 2017 after serving his six @-@ month prison sentence from the Central Pr@@ ison in Mas@@ k@@ at . al @-@ Ha@@ j is still in prison , where he served as a prison sentence .
the Appe@@ als Court also raised the Ministry of Information &apos;s decision to close the newspaper &quot; Az@@ am@@ n . &quot;
in spite of the Court &apos;s decision to permit Az@@ am@@ n again , the paper still faces attacks by the om@@ anic government .
on 8 January , the Minister of Information issued an order with which the closure of Az@@ am@@ n was extended by three months .
on 8 May 2017 , the Minister of Information himself signed another statement in which the closure of &quot; Az@@ am@@ n &quot; was extended by three additional months and with which the minister once more opposed the decision of the Appe@@ als Court to re@@ publish the publication of the paper .
the ongoing closure of Az@@ am@@ n and the attacks on journalists of the newspaper are not the only cases in which the press freedom was viol@@ ated in Oman in recent times .
further injuries include , for example , the closure of the website of the independent magazine M@@ ow@@ atin and the exercise of pressure on Al@@ bal@@ ad , the first independent online newspaper of the country to cease its operation .
due to the ongoing closure of Az@@ am@@ n and the detention of the journalist Al @-@ Ha@@ j , the impression that the Japanese authorities are still not ready to put an end to the extensive violation of freedom of the press .
Gulf Centre for Human Rights ( G@@ CH@@ R ) calls on the Korean authorities to :
1 . release You@@ se@@ f Al @-@ Ha@@ j immediately and un@@ condition@@ ally ;
2. to create a safe environment for the newspaper Az@@ am@@ n so that their journalists can pursue their work ;
3. to protect freedom of the press in the country and
4 . in all circumstances , to ensure that human rights def@@ enders and journalists in Oman have been able to exercise their legitimate human rights work without fear of ret@@ ali@@ ation measures , including judicial har@@ ass@@ ment .

medical research in Africa : opportunities and mis@@ understand@@ ings
Ran@@ j@@ it War@@ rier 2016 in Zambia , mapping takes place with his consent
medical research in Africa is rarely mentioned or even mentioned in the media . this is a growing area addressing one of the most urgent needs of the continent .
there are two reasons for the need for medical research carried out on @-@ site : on the one hand many medicines and vacc@@ ines are missing in the global healthcare system , covering special medical need on the African continent .
diseases such as AIDS , tuber@@ cu@@ lo@@ sis and mal@@ aria have far more serious effects than elsewhere in the poor@@ est countries of Africa than elsewhere , and lack of investment for the investigation of these diseases by the pharmaceutical companies is a big problem .
second , research carried out by African scientists will help build its own research capacities in Africa . a major role of science and technology can only be condu@@ ci@@ ve to the economic growth of the continent .
Dr. Ran@@ j@@ it War@@ rier is Director of the Centre for Research on Inf@@ ectious Disease in Zambia ( Centre for Inf@@ ectious Disease Research in Zambia , C@@ ID@@ R@@ Z ) .
he grew up in Lus@@ aka , Zambia in the 1990s , when the AIDS epide@@ mic had first serious implications for national health .
he left Zambia for a study in the United States , initially in Lou@@ isi@@ ana , later in Indi@@ ana .
when post@@ doc at the University of Pennsylvania he resear@@ ched the HIV virus himself before he decided to go back home in order to support the Ministry of Health .
with Global Vo@@ ices , Dr. War@@ rier discussed the future of medical research in Zambia and about mis@@ understand@@ ings of the media about this research .
( Dis@@ claim@@ er : Dr. War@@ rier speaks as a private person ) .
global Vo@@ ices ( GM ) : what is your research topic ?
Ran@@ j@@ it War@@ rier RW : at the moment the focus of my work is on the application of research results . I support the national programme for anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy ( ART ) with laboratory tests .
I also started a research program for the development of molecular diagnostic tests for HIV , TB and other relevant patho@@ gens .
GM : what do you think are the most important current scientific topics in your country and in general in Africa ?
how do they differ from those in Western countries ?
RW : there is no basic research here . we only use solutions that have been developed elsewhere .
this has to change , otherwise we will always remain recipients instead of being a creator .
the solutions we get are often not usable in our environment , and sometimes it is even impossible to use them here .
GM : where does the funding and support come from ?
is it sufficient ?
how easy or difficult is it to find suitable scientists for the projects ?
RW : from the USA and Europe .
the projects are supported differently .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is difficult to find people who want to come back or move here , because financing and development opportunities are better in other countries . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
GM : what is the research infrastructure ?
what obstacles are there in your routine research work that you didn &apos;t have before ?
RW : the basic infrastructure does not meet the standards in developed countries . it costs a lot of money to have a continuous supply of electricity , water and internet .
laboratory equipment is expensive , and it takes months to import it from other countries .
GM : what is the opinion of the public about science and scientists in Africa ?
RW : there is already interest , but only a very limited understanding of scientific methods .
I would suggest that critical thinking and scientific methods should be taught in schools to improve the situation .
GM : how big is your opinion on the potential of scientific research in Africa , what should it focus on , and how can we support development ?
RW : the potential is amazing .
I have seen great students of all ages .
there is a need for special scientific training , starting at any age .
social sciences , computer science , big data , resear@@ ching the space , healthcare ( non @-@ communic@@ able and infectious diseases ) and the efficiency of traditional medicine will benefit greatly .
GM : can you describe the advantages and disadvantages of life as scientists in Africa versus Western countries based on your experience ?
RW : often , it &apos;s the limited speed to do things , and the difficult access to scientific expertise that poses challenges here .
the system that magazines make articles accessible only against payment ( the so @-@ called &quot; Pay@@ wall &quot; ) , also limits the amount of available information and the speed of research .
from the USA to India : how &quot; open source &quot; seed producers change global food production
this post by Rachel C@@ ern@@ an@@ sky was originally published on the website En@@ si@@ a.com , a magazine that reports on solutions for environmental problems worldwide .
Frank Mor@@ ton has been growing salad in the USA since the 1980s .
its company offers 114 grades , such as Out@@ ra@@ geous , the first plant cultivated and consumed by NASA a@@ stron@@ au@@ ts in space .
for almost 20 years , Mor@@ ton &apos;s work was limited only by his own resour@@ c@@ efulness and the question of how many kinds of salad he can get .
but at the beginning of the 2000 he noticed that more and more salads were patented and that he could not use them further for breeding .
the patents filed not only for individual varieties , but also for certain properties , such as resistance to diseases , a special red or green tone or cri@@ mp@@ ed leaves .
in recent years , more and more such patents have been applied to more and more plants such as cereals or car@@ rots . due to this trend , plant breeders , environ@@ ment@@ alists and experts ensure food security for the future of food production .
as a passionate representative of a mill@@ en@@ nia @-@ old tradition , Mor@@ ton still breeds salad , but now he needs longer since his work is increasingly difficult due to more and more restrictions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is as if a b@@ oul@@ der in a river is lying around which I must p@@ addle . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
so we have to do that now , but it &apos;s a break with the breeding tradition , &quot; he says . &quot; I think these patents go too far for salads .
and if they stand before the court , no one can breed a new sort of let@@ tu@@ ce , because all the features are already patented . &quot;
however , it is very careful and endeav@@ ours not to use any material that is protected as intellectual property .
he has also joined a movement that is growing bigger in the U.S. and around the world : open Source Bre@@ eding ( Open Source Bre@@ eding ) .
a@@ stron@@ au@@ ts of the International Space Station ISS have grown and ate red Roman salad of the Out@@ ra@@ geous variety in the &quot; glas@@ sh@@ ouse &quot; of the station , where it is tested whether plants can be grown in space .

it is no coincidence that this name sounds rather like the movement from the IT field and not from the field of plant breeding .
the Open Source Se@@ ed Initiative ( initiative for open @-@ source seeds ) is inspired by the movement for free &quot; open source &quot; software that provides alternatives to copy@@ righ@@ ted software .
it was launched to ensure that some plant species and genes are not protected as intellectual property and thus permanently usable for plant breeders .
in the context of the initiative , called O@@ ss@@ i , US farmers can commit themselves to free use of seeds bred by them .
however , this does not mean that they do not continue to do business with their seeds and sell it . &quot; open source &quot; breeders only allow others who purchase their seeds to breed it in order to breed their own varieties and do not immediately sow - two aspects which are banned or prescribed by many plant patents .
dozens of breeders and seed companies have already joined the initiative since their launch in 2014 .
more som@@ bre prospects
for the professor at the University of Wis@@ con@@ sin @-@ Ma@@ dison and O@@ ss@@ i board member Jack Klo@@ pp@@ enburg , control over seeds and the possibility of breeding new plants are both important for food security and environmental protection .
according to him , seed plays a role in larger contexts such as biodiversity , farmers &apos; rights , control of the food system and the use of chemicals in agriculture . independent breeders would try to use the latter not or only little by raising seeds with natural resistance .
Klo@@ pp@@ enburg emphas@@ ises that the &quot; open @-@ source &quot; movement does not work with genetically modified plants .
all kinds of plants could be patented , whether vegetables , grain , genetically modified or not , from ecological agriculture or not . &quot; in order to achieve our goal of ecological sustainability , we need control over seeds , &quot; he says , taking into account the increasingly common mer@@ gers in the global agricultural industry . &quot; anyone who wants to buy good , locally and sustain@@ ably produced vegetables should also know that the way this vegetable is bred is threatened .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; food sovereignty without seed sovereignty is not possible . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the members of the Open Source Se@@ ed Initiative are committed to making their seeds available to others . in contrast , their approach is to patent seeds and plant attributes .
photo by Jack Klo@@ pp@@ enburg .
O@@ ss@@ i supporters argue that the future of food supply is endangered as the available gene pool is constantly shr@@ inking due to the increasing number of intellectual property rights on plant material , which is therefore always restricted .
Cla@@ ire Lu@@ by , executive director of the O@@ ss@@ i , has engaged in her doctoral thesis with genetic variation in car@@ rots and their availability . she found out that about a third of all the key characteristics are protected as intellectual property , which makes it suitable for plant breeders either not or only complic@@ at@@ edly .
for other plants , such estimates are not yet available , but experts like Lu@@ by assume that m@@ aci@@ ously cultivated plants such as wheat are patented in even greater style than let@@ tu@@ ce or car@@ rots .
a question of view
plants are grown in such a way that they have specific desired characteristics - from those through which their taste or color improves to such , because of which they thri@@ ve in certain environments and can withstand threats such as p@@ ests or diseases .
opponents of patents on plant properties point out that the available plant material for breeders is decreasing due to more and more patents . at present , genetic diversity is more necessary than ever since the changed conditions are much worse due to climate change .
in an email , Mon@@ san@@ to Spe@@ aker C@@ arly S@@ ca@@ du@@ to acknow@@ le@@ dges that genetic diversity is generally important and also vital for Mon@@ san@@ to &apos;s activities . with a total of four gene banks and cooperation with institutions such as the United States Department of Agriculture , the company is committed to maintaining genetic diversity .
however , it does not contradic@@ t the notion that intellectual property protects other breeders because &quot; patents and the protection of plant vari@@ et@@ ets promote innovation . &quot; a patent is basically a plan that anyone can follow as soon as the patent has expi@@ red .
often these instructions help others to get the same result with another method .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so such protection does not hin@@ der innovation , but promotes it by providing more material and know @-@ how to the public . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mor@@ ton sees it different : waiting for 20 years until a patent exp@@ els , certainly does not promote innovation .
and if you have to wait so long to grow on plants that are adapted to the changed environmental conditions , you would have already lost the battle .
but the main argument for Mor@@ ton is that genetic resources have always been a common good and should remain : &quot; independent plant breeders have neither the time nor the money for such form@@ alities , and monetary incentives are not attractive to us .
we want farmers to make their work easier .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is what drives us and it is impossible for us to continue to use the best and newest genetic resources . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; altogether , Mor@@ ton is interfer@@ ing with the concept of pat@@ enting plant attributes : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we don &apos;t really create the features themselves . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the plants form themselves and as breeders we finally have no idea how the plants do this .
a secret of nature . &quot;
for C@@ aro@@ l Dep@@ pe , plant bree@@ der in the O@@ reg@@ on and O@@ ss@@ i board member , there is another important aspect of plant breeding : &quot; he who breeds a variety also breeds his own values into it .
those who believe in industrial agriculture with large farms and mono@@ cultures , for whose cultivation m@@ ole her@@ bi@@ cides are needed , breeds this concept of agriculture in its varieties .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my concept is exactly opposite . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
while some medium @-@ sized companies ( those who move on international markets , but smaller than Mon@@ san@@ to ) patents , most smaller seed companies manage to survive without patents - either they reject the patent or they consider it too expensive and therefore not worthwhile or both are the case .
the independent plant bree@@ der Frank Mor@@ ton is looking for Sal@@ ate in his breeding garden .

Mor@@ ton also believes that breeders would be more innovative by avoiding plant patents : &quot; it looks like I am with my efforts to produce something new , stronger than companies that patent .
I constantly need new material for my catalog , because I know that my competitors will sell my varieties in a few years themselves , &quot; he says . &quot; with a patent , one is protected for 20 years ahead of competition , which makes it really easy for my opinion . &quot; global response
although the US seems to be a leader in &quot; open source &quot; breeding , the concept is now spreading rapidly around the world .
in India , the Centre for Sustainable Agriculture ( &quot; Centre for Sustainable Agriculture &quot; ) , which describes itself as a professional organization in the field of resources , uses an open @-@ source seed programme .
it also supports them to come to &quot; open source &quot; seeds and sell their own .
the German organisation Agre@@ col is working on an open @-@ source licence , which ultimately constitutes a formal and legally binding form of O@@ ss@@ i &apos;s commitment to breeders in the European Union .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; rules for breeding are different from country to country , which is why the O@@ ss@@ i commitment cannot simply be taken one to one in Europe or other parts of the world . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the beginning of November 2016 , the executive of the European Union , the European Commission , announced that conven@@ tionally bred plants should not be pat@@ ent@@ able , thus referring to the current practice of the European Patent Office that patents on conven@@ tionally bred plants .
however , a declaration is not a law yet ; it is now at the governments of the Member States to bring the patent office to implement this new line .
in October 2016 , the Dutch organization Hi@@ v@@ os hosted a conference on &quot; open source &quot; seed systems in Ethiopia where farmers , operators of seed banks and representatives of governments , NGOs and seed companies from all over East Africa came together to learn about the &quot; open source &quot; seed movement and the worldwide trend towards seeds pat@@ enting .
Willy Dou@@ ma , responsible for Hi@@ v@@ os &apos; program for &quot; open source &quot; seed systems , explains that the organization is currently building a global alliance for &quot; open source &quot; seed systems for which the official launch is scheduled next year .
a consortium of environmental and development groups ( including Hi@@ v@@ os , the international non @-@ profit development organisation US@@ C Canada and the Action Group on erosion , Technology and Con@@ centr@@ ation ) has compiled a database of seed and biodiversity around the world to publish the Se@@ ed Map Project , a seed map .
in September , the Global Alliance for the Future of Food , the Global Alliance for the Future of Food , has published a report from organisations such as the W@@ K Kel@@ log@@ g Foundation , Mc@@ Knight Foundation and others .
the report also emphas@@ ises the importance of a diverse local supply of seeds for sustainable food systems - a context that Lu@@ by von O@@ ss@@ i hopes that more people will soon see him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the movement for regional and ecological food has largely paid attention to where and how something is grown and seed systems have hardly played a role , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Lu@@ by . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

human rights organisation and blog are the latest targets of cens@@ orship in Egypt
the Egyptian authorities still block content on the internet .
this time it was the website of a human rights organisation and the blog of a colum@@ n@@ ist .
on the weekend of 5 August , the Egyptian government blocked the website of the Arabic Network for Human Rights Information ( AN@@ H@@ RI ) , which documents human rights violations in Egypt and the Arab world .
in August , the network published a statement on Facebook , which critic@@ ised the Egyptian authorities for this step and promised to continue the work and efforts for human rights in the region .
the Arabic Network for Human Rights Information remains true to its goal in defending freedom of expression and human rights in the Arab world . even though it has never been so difficult to continue to pursue these goals , it has never been as important as now . AN@@ H@@ RI acknow@@ le@@ dges that all technical possibilities are exhausted to overcome the block@@ ade and not give in . we ins@@ ist on further fulfilling our task .
AN@@ H@@ RI is considered the first cens@@ ored website of a human rights organisation in Egypt after the authorities blocked 21 sites over two months ago , for example the independent news page M@@ ada Mas@@ r , Arab @-@ language edition of the Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post and the Al Jaz@@ e@@ era network originating from Qatar for alleged &quot; support of terrorism . &quot;
# Egypt : 1 . human rights organisation of the wave of site barriers to victims . @ an@@ hr@@ i is one of the main sources of human rights in Arabic language ht@@ t@@ ps : / / t.@@ co / NI@@ Z@@ m@@ Op@@ DS@@ 5@@ K
besides AN@@ H@@ RI , the blog of the colum@@ n@@ ist and human rights researcher Ah@@ med Gam@@ al Zi@@ ada has no access to Egypt .
Zi@@ ada used his blog for the distribution of columns and articles , which he writes for in Egypt non @-@ accessible websites and media .
now the blog , which he set up to circum@@ vent the cens@@ or apparatus of the Egyptian government itself , became the target of an attack .
blo@@ gger , the provider with which Canada &apos;s blog is also located , is further accessible .
Zi@@ ada , a former photo@@ journalist , spent nearly 500 days in captivity after he was arrested by Egyptian security forces in December 2013 , while he reported on the student protests and recorded a video on how police exercised physical violence against two students .
his articles mainly revol@@ ve around politics and the human rights situation in Egypt .
in a Facebook comment , Zi@@ ada expressed the blocking of the government and reflected what this means for him :
the blo@@ gs to ban blo@@ gs is very old , but has priority in the era of Ab@@ del@@ fat@@ tah al @-@ S@@ isi ; and even if the blo@@ gging of the blog may not be significant to the world , it is for two reasons for me :
1 ) It has been possible for them to convey a sense of siege to me ; an arrest , an attempted murder , a charge of the National Security Council , the blocking of blo@@ gs and any other web page I worked for .
2 ) You have proven that I did not write in vain . in other words , my words have influence , if only to a small audience .
I would like to mention that this blog was an archive for me .
first , I used it to post articles to circum@@ vent cens@@ orship .
but now , after blocking it and that they are afraid of words , I can still change the link or create a second blog .
the brave go the way to the end .
according to the Association for Freedom of Th@@ ought and Expression ( af@@ te ) Egyptian authorities blocked 133 websites from 24 May to 06 August . this resulted in technical tests in the networks of various Internet Service Provi@@ ders ( ISP ) , including Orange , Vo@@ da@@ f@@ one and ET@@ IS@@ A@@ LA@@ T .
af@@ te also documented the blocking of vendors that were possible through the circum@@ vention of internet cens@@ orship and private surfing , so @-@ called Virtual Private Networks ( V@@ P@@ N@@ s )
af@@ te reported in her research :
on Monday , 12 June , we noticed how the blocking of web pages that V@@ P@@ N@@ s offered began .
such a practice suggests the government &apos;s intention to continue blocking and filtering content on which Egyptian users could have access .
the situation is additionally exac@@ erb@@ ated by the fact that the cens@@ orship decisions are made behind closed doors , which means that the Egyptian population has no legal basis with which they can act against these actions in court .
now the question arises : how far is the Egyptian government ready to go to cens@@ orship and who will attack it next ?
is Rio de Janeiro in war ?
the inhabitants argue .
the Brazilian army used in the F@@ av@@ el@@ as in Nit@@ er@@ Ã³@@ i , a city in the state of Rio de Janeiro , during the government crisis .

day after day newspapers report in Brazil with dark head@@ lines from Rio de Janeiro , the second largest city in the country and home to numerous postcard motifs .
some of these head@@ lines are as follows :
&quot; 14 @-@ year @-@ old shot at school , &quot; &quot; Every second day a police officer is murdered in Rio de Janeiro , &quot; &quot; Thi@@ eves Rob@@ ben pharmacy with military weapons , &quot; &quot; President Tem@@ er sends 8@@ 500 troops of the army , nav@@ y and air @-@ air to Rio . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the midst of the economic crisis and in a ten@@ se financial situation , the 2017 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Viol@@ ence &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reached the highest level for 10 years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Brazilian non @-@ governmental organization Global Justice even called upon the United Nations to intervene .
reports like these have become com@@ mon@@ place and this is unacceptable &amp; # 8@@ 212 ; find at least the managers of a local newspaper .
so the newspaper &quot; Extra &quot; known for detailed reporting on violence in Rio , on 16th August , published the editorial &quot; That &apos;s not normal , &quot; in which she announced to set up a new section called &quot; War in Rio . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all reports on violence in the city are now published there . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the newspaper explained the motives for their decision :
extra will continue to report on crimes that happen in every major city in the world like murder , rob@@ ber@@ y , sexual crimes , etc . , but what happens to the civili@@ zed standard and what happens only in Rio will be published in the heading &quot; War in Rio . &quot; ( ... ) This is our way of calling : this is not normal !
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the only alternative so that we as journalists do not close our eyes to cru@@ el@@ ty . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in a four @-@ minute video shared on Facebook , Oc@@ t@@ Ã¡@@ vio Gu@@ edes , editor @-@ in @-@ chief of the newspaper , explained that this decision was not an occasion for pride , but rather a sign of failure :
extra is probably the only newspaper all over the world with a war of war in a country that does not recognize war at all .
in the same video , a journalist says that according to the Institute for Internal Security in Rio de Janeiro , there are 8@@ 43 areas controlled by criminal organisations .
in the editorial the newspaper writes :
we are aware that a war dis@@ courses if it is distorted , can also be used to ret@@ ou@@ ch atro@@ cities of the police , who only shoot and then ask questions .
but we defend the war based on information and the fight against corruption in the police whose aim is not the civilian population , but the economic power of the Ma@@ fia and its partners .
does the term &quot; war &quot; harm more than it benefits ?
in an article on the news portal The Inter@@ c@@ ept Bra@@ sil , the journalist C@@ ec@@ Ã­@@ lia Oli@@ v@@ eira , on the other hand , ar@@ gues that violence is called &quot; war . &quot; this is in her opinion a justification of the failed security policy by the media and could make it more difficult to hold accoun@@ table to the police .
this is not a war .
this is the result of corruption and poor planning - as demonstrated in the analysis of military operations in Rio itself - in combination with insufficient investment in personnel , education and a historical and self @-@ pleasing negl@@ ect of public service .
remember : the state of Rio de Janeiro is bigger than just its capital .

calling Rio de Janeiro as &quot; the most violent place in Brazil , &quot; according to C@@ ec@@ Ã­@@ lia is wrong : &quot; 22 of the 30 most violent cities in Brazil are according to statistics of 2015 in the north and northeast of the country . these are the latest available data .
none of these cities are located in the state of Rio de Janeiro .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if we look at the murder rate per state , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Rio is in place 16 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; she writes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the company Glob@@ o , the largest media company in South America , is especially one of the biggest media companies in South America , which , like C@@ ec@@ Ã­@@ lia , has been empha@@ sizing the state &apos;s security policy for years .
the creation of the U@@ PP ( Uni@@ da@@ de de Pol@@ Ã­@@ cia P@@ aci@@ fic@@ ad@@ ora ) , a police unit established by the State of Rio in 2003 , was also part of these security policy measures , whose aim is to capture a fav@@ ela by using a massive police ra@@ cket and permanently station@@ ing a unit there .
in the beginning , this actually resulted in a decrease of violent deaths . however , after several years , the U@@ PP was increasingly under fire after several reports on har@@ ass@@ ment and repression against the poor communities , which should actually protect the newly created police unit .
on his Facebook page , journalist Jo@@ Ã£o Paulo Char@@ le@@ aux selected one of his articles from 2010 , in which he explains why violence in Rio does not comply with the criteria set out by the Geneva Convention for the designation &quot; Civil War . &quot;
he writes :
in addition to legal issues , the classification of the situation in Rio as a war also causes serious consequences for the people .
this calls for the state to use resources and means typical of a war . this includes penetration into the territory of a &quot; enemy , &quot; where a civilian is a sharp point in the landscape and becomes an object for &quot; coll@@ ateral damage &quot; and &quot; stra@@ y bul@@ lets . &quot;
war back or forth , fact is that the inhabitants of the fav@@ el@@ as in Rio continue to suffer .
it is a week ago that the police er@@ cl@@ ed the mountain with the F@@ av@@ ela Jac@@ are@@ zin@@ ho in order to av@@ enge the death of a polic@@ eman .
in the midst of all this violence this incident also made head@@ lines : a sal@@ es@@ man died as a result of shots fired by the police from a helicopter .

to stay alive : besi@@ eg@@ ed Syrians learn to plant mushrooms
screen@@ shot from the advertising video .
source : Can@@ Do@@ Action
since the beginning of the Syrian revolution in 2011 and the ensu@@ ing civil war , many Syrian cities suffer from brutal siege and block@@ ades , mainly by the Assad regime against loyal troops .
according to victories Watch , a joint initiative of the PA@@ X peace organisation and the research institute , The Syria Institute , is currently around one million Syrians in a state of siege in Damascus and Um@@ land , H@@ oms , Dei@@ r E@@ zz@@ or and I@@ d@@ li@@ b .
the region of East Gh@@ out@@ a is particularly affected , where an attack with chemical weapons on 21 August 2013 demanded the lives of hundreds of civilians .
many governments , international organisations and the Syrian opposition are based on investigations by the United Nations and other human rights organisations that the massacre of the Assad regime was perpet@@ rated .
since 2013 , these rebel @-@ controlled areas outside Damascus have been under siege , leading to the need for local residents , tunnels and control points to rely on smu@@ g@@ gled food .
due to the years of block@@ ade , traditional food such as meat has become un@@ at@@ tain@@ able for large parts of the population .
as a counter@@ measure , a group of Syrian humanitarian workers and ac@@ adem@@ ics is teaching the inhabitants of East Gh@@ out@@ as to plant their own mushrooms as a &quot; life @-@ saving food source . &quot;
they call themselves G@@ hi@@ ras Al@@ nah@@ da and carry out the project together with the NGO Al @-@ Ad@@ ala .
mushrooms do not belong to traditional foods cultivated in Syria and are rarely part of the Syrian cuisine . however , their food makes them an attractive source of food for many residents of the besi@@ eg@@ ed East Gh@@ out@@ a .
the Direc@@ tly of the project , Ab@@ o Nab@@ il , said to the French news agency AF@@ P :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we chose the cultivation of mushrooms because they have a high nutritional value , similar to meat , and because they can plant them in houses and cellars . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Dr. Ah@@ med Lei@@ la , one of the organizers , reports Global Vo@@ ices that for three years he has been campaig@@ ning for the announcement of this project and expressed his relief that it now becomes more and more known . &quot;
to earn money for the initiative , we use the Human@@ itarian crow@@ d@@ funding platform Can@@ Do in consultation with the NGO G@@ hi@@ ras Al@@ nah@@ da .
it is planned to convey 125 families knowledge of planting mushrooms , Dr. Lei@@ la becomes Global Vo@@ ices .
at the time of the constitution of this article , they have reached over 100 % of their expected target of around â¬ 12,@@ 700 , but will continue to collect donations to Can@@ Do until Monday , September 04 , 2017 .
the initiative depends on generators that keep the temperature stable at 25 Â° C and humidity at 80 % .
because of the fuel shortage , locally produced plastic prop@@ ell@@ ants are used to supply the generators with the necessary energy .
Dr. Lei@@ la said Global Vo@@ ices that they began &quot; production from the regions originating from the regions &quot; before veri@@ fying their quality and whether they are suitable for consumption .
then they planted a small mushroom yard in a tub . when this succeeded , they used a larger tub . and so on .
now they have designed a &quot; educational farm for the region . &quot;
since the beginning of the project and after another 3 months , they have distributed mushrooms everywhere in East Gh@@ out@@ a free of charge .
Dr. Lei@@ la explained that it is part of a larger movement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to teach people mushroom breeding for various reasons : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; breaking the siege . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
providing a new food source in the market .
spread a culture of self @-@ suffici@@ ency by using food lef@@ to@@ vers ( such as paper , tea , coffee , cardboard , etc . ) for obtaining new food .
creation of new jobs , especially for women who work at home .
creating new jobs for people with disabilities who are tied to their homes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; We hope to spread this idea all over the world , so that our success as well as our fight against hunger and siege will become visible . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want our experience to inspire people in crisis areas and we can help humanity . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

Portuguese demand justice for victims of fires in 2017
several hundred people were prot@@ esting in many of Portugal &apos;s capital cities on 21 October , calling for justice for the victims of the fires ra@@ ging in the north of Portugal in the week before .
forty @-@ two people died and some 70 were injured as a result of the forest fires of 15 and 16 October . this resulted in the government calling for a mourning period last week from solidarity with the victims for 3 days .
fires were also recorded in Gali@@ cia in Spain , where there were 4 deaths .
it is estimated that there were more than 500 fire out@@ breaks that spread in the northern and central regions of the country and reached approximately 250 million hectares of forest and numerous villages .
in June there was a similar tragedy in Ped@@ r@@ Ã³@@ g@@ Ã£o Grande , where there were 64 deaths and more than 200 deaths .
according to the European forest monitoring system , which monitors forest areas by satellite photographs alone in 2017 , approximately 500@@ ,000 hectares of forest are burned in Portugal - an area of the size of the Lisbon district .
so that you can make a better picture of the seri@@ ousness of the situation : there is no fire only in 4 districts .
the whole of Portugal is burning in the tru@@ est sense of the word # Pra@@ y@@ For@@ Portugal - nat@@ a . ( @ a _ at@@ aner ) October 15th , 2017
some pictures shared by Twitter users :
that &apos;s Bra@@ ga tonight . # Pra@@ y@@ For@@ Portugal # Bra@@ ga # Fo@@ g@@ os@@ PT
numerous videos are spread on the net and show images that allow for better insight into what is happening :
the fores@@ eeable tragedy
the goal of Saturday &apos;s protests was the demand for better preventive and fire fighting measures by the state .
people asked why the Civil Guard was unable to cur@@ b the extent of the tragedy as far as possible .
Jo@@ Ã£o Sover@@ al of the Federation of Far@@ mers of Portugal explained the paper P@@ Ãº@@ b@@ lic@@ o :
the streets and villages were evacu@@ ated to Ped@@ r@@ Ã³@@ g@@ Ã£o for everything and nothing .
this Sunday they did not do it anywhere : there are dozens of open roads that were surrounded by fire .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the forest of Lei@@ ria , a similar tragedy could have happened in June , as the streets were closed very late . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition , building permits in locations with high fire risk are questioned .
a far @-@ reaching proposal for the reform of the forest , which the government had brought in after serious fires in 2003 and 2005 , was obj@@ ected by the local authorities who saw the new rules as an obstacle to investment .
&quot; the government carried out a sl@@ ack@@ ening of the law allowing construction activity to fall if the applicant had a means of self @-@ protection - that was an open back door , so that everything could be built , &quot; Jo@@ Ã£o Sor@@ val proceeds in the same article by the paper P@@ Ãº@@ b@@ lic@@ o .
the environmental organization Qu@@ erc@@ us pointed out that large areas with eu@@ calyp@@ tus trees , trees made of easily inflamm@@ able wood , spread like in a vi@@ cious circle , according to fires of this kind .
these problems add that the website of the civil defence of Portugal on 15 and 16 October , when people sought information or attempted to contact their relatives , was offline .
it was a private initiative that provided the population with information : it took advantage of its own civil protection data using the application fo@@ g@@ os.@@ pt and informed the population in real time about the location and the spread of fires .
the project was launched by the developer Jo@@ Ã£o P@@ ina in 2015 to simplify the work of the fire bri@@ g@@ ade and was not able to resist this fat@@ eful weekend in October that the servers were not able to resist the ons@@ lau@@ ght of the 400@@ ,000 users who followed the fires : the site counted more than half a million requests .
even the founder asked for help :

the path from Afghanistan to a successful entrepren@@ eur
A@@ shar@@ af Bar@@ ati and his friend and colleague Y@@ as@@ in Tan@@ in in Venice .

in one night in the fall of 1994 , the occupation of Afghanistan began by the Tali@@ ban .
two years before , a terrible civil war broke out between the various Mu@@ j@@ ah@@ edi@@ n group@@ ings that had defeated the short @-@ lived pro @-@ Soviet government . thus , Afghanistan became a country of terror and despair .
at that time A@@ shar@@ af Bar@@ ati , a 13 @-@ year @-@ old boy belonging to the ethnic group of Haz@@ ara , sat together in G@@ haz@@ ni Province in Central Afghanistan for the last time with his family at dinner .
even if his mother didn &apos;t tell her then she knew she wouldn &apos;t see her son for a long time - maybe even more .
in the dawn the boy should break .
his unc@@ le would pick him up and bring him to the tu@@ gs .

CC @-@ 2.0
Ab@@ dul Ali Maz@@ ari , the leader of the He@@ z@@ b @-@ e @-@ Wah@@ oo party dominated by Haz@@ ara , had just been murdered by the Tali@@ ban and many Haz@@ ara felt un@@ protected .
the Tali@@ ban , known for their hatred of the Haz@@ ara , came closer and closer .
many Haz@@ ara left the country towards Pakistan or Iran .
a few days after his escape , A@@ shar@@ af found himself in Pakistan .
for a few years he worked in a coal mine . the work was difficult and made him sick .
then he took what was left of his little wage and went to Iran . once again he was in a foreign country together with other refugees and dra@@ gged sacks with mort@@ ars that were heavier than he himself to make a living .
back then , like today , the life of Afgh@@ an refugees in Iran was characterised by misery and exploitation .
&quot; it was really hard , &quot; A@@ shar@@ af rec@@ alled in an interview with Global Vo@@ ices . &quot; we ( Afgh@@ an refugees ) lived in an empty building on the construction site , on which we also worked .
there were no services and no heating there . we put nylon in front of the open windows to avoid freezing at night . &quot;
after four years , A@@ shar@@ af left his life without papers in Iran and was ready for the journey to Europe .
during the dangerous crossing on the sea he suffered ship@@ wre@@ ck and str@@ anded on a small , un@@ inhabited Greek island .
after the Greek authorities refused asylum , A@@ shar@@ af joined Italy in 2002 .
some time A@@ shar@@ af was homeless , ran alone through the streets of Rome , slept in parks and went to a church that distributed food to needy people twice a day .
it is true that due to relatively high yield rates Italy is a kind of second chance for rejected asylum seekers . however , it is also true that the conditions that find asylum seekers in the country are cat@@ astrop@@ hic .
the human rights organisation Civil Liber@@ ties Union for Europe writes that the system &quot; suffers from a general lack of transparency .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the vast majority of asylum seekers are accommodated in over 3000 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; special recording centres &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the hands of un@@ qualified and un@@ qualified personnel . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to the Italian law , asylum seekers can only be allocated to an admission centre if they have officially submitted an application for asylum - which may go for months after the application of the asylum application .
until then , people who do not have money for accommodation are either dependent on the hospitality of friends or have to sleep on the street .
so it was also A@@ shar@@ af .
but his lack of life helped A@@ shar@@ af to get rid of these conditions soon .
after spending several years working in the construction industry , A@@ shar@@ af found his entire savings in the establishment of a hostel in Venice .
this went so well that after a while he opened a second hostel and a fast @-@ food bar .
A@@ shar@@ af Bar@@ atis &apos;s success story is now subject of the documentary &quot; Beh@@ ind Venice Luxury - a Haz@@ ara in Italy &quot; ( German : &quot; behind vene@@ tian luxury - a Haz@@ ara in Italy &quot; ) by the director Am@@ in Wa@@ hi@@ di .
the film won the Venice City Award in 2017 , which was awarded for the 24th time in 2017 .

the conditions for entrepreneurs in Italy - especially for non @-@ Itali@@ ans - are very difficult .
a lot of bureaucracy , high taxes and conditions for loans are just a few of the obstacles .
according to in@@ official estimates , about 20,000 Afgh@@ ans live in Italy .
for many of them , the country is a transitional solution on the way to other European countries .
in recent years , some Afgh@@ ans operated companies , including tail@@ ors , travel agencies , hotels and restaurants .
some Afgh@@ an restaurants were even praised in the Italian press for their excellent cuisine .
in Venice , Ham@@ ed Ah@@ ma@@ di had the idea of his restaurant Orient Experience where the wa@@ iters and the kitchen staff were mostly refugees from different parts of the world .
the menu of the restaurant tells the story of their trip to Italy through the various Afgh@@ an , Iraqi , Turkish and Greek dishes .
the Afgh@@ an entrepren@@ eur Ali Khan Q@@ al@@ and@@ ari opened the Peace &amp; amp Restaurant in Pa@@ dua , and also behind the pizz@@ eria Kab@@ u@@ log@@ na in Bologna and a s@@ ushi restaurant in Rome there are also Afgh@@ ans .
however , A@@ shar@@ af@@ s targets extend far beyond the Italian hospitality industry and retail and aim back to the country he forced to leave as a teen@@ ager .
&quot; where there is a risk , there are also possibilities , &quot; says A@@ shar@@ af with a smile . &quot; I want to invest in Afghanistan .
I have never forgotten my country and I cannot live happily if I know my people are suffering .
I plan a project for farmers from the poor@@ est provinces of the country , especially for women .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they represent half of society and must get the same possibilities as everyone else . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
A@@ shar@@ af also forged plans for the opening of a factory in Kab@@ ul , where people can learn packaging and conservation techniques . &quot; thus they can sell their crop sur@@ pl@@ uses on the market and improve their financial situation , &quot; he says .
the development of a successful entrepren@@ eur was a journey through uncertainty and doubt , but in the end stand stability and prosperity .
A@@ shar@@ af has made this journey for himself . now he wants to help other Afgh@@ ans on this path .
citizen report : bill dra@@ fts from Egypt enable dis@@ connection of social networks Mah@@ m@@ oud Abu Z@@ aid , aka Sha@@ w@@ kan , for more than 900 days in prison .
he reported on the evacu@@ ation of the Rab@@ a &apos;@@ a el A@@ da@@ we@@ ya camp in Cairo , prot@@ esting against the de@@ composition of President Mohamed Mor@@ si .
photo from @ C@@ il@@ un@@ a@@ 27 on Twitter shared .
global Vo@@ ices Ad@@ voc@@ ac@@ ys Ne@@ tizen &apos;s report is an international snapshot that shows challenges , wins and emerging trends in global Internet rights
the Egyptian parliament has reviewed a bill that fores@@ ees that users can only use social media such as Twitter or Facebook after registering with a government authority .
users must register to use social networks within six months of submitting a valid bill of law on the authority &apos;s website , stating their full name and ID number .
anyone who missed this step could be sentenced to six months &apos; imprisonment or tri@@ bul@@ ations of a pen@@ al payment .
the law , which was adverti@@ sed by sixty members of parliament , is currently in the legislative and constitutional committee of the Parliament and is to be deb@@ ated there .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in May another member of the Bundestag submitted a proposal to introduce tough@@ er sanctions for the insul@@ t of the president or a senior civil servant . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
under the law proposition , however , such a deed would be punished with prison and fin@@ es , as legal experts of the Tah@@ ri@@ r Institute for Middle East Policy .
if the law is to be passed , this may mean three years in prison for the condemned .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; furthermore , this would support a political climate in which the right to freedom of expression and freedom of assembly has been in danger already for many years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a striking example is the case of the Egyptian photographer Mah@@ m@@ oud Ab@@ o Z@@ ID ( known as Sha@@ w@@ kan ) who captured Egyptian polic@@ emen while demonstrating violence against demonstr@@ ators who demonstrated against the military coup that had led to the removal of the elected president Mohammed Mor@@ si .
Sha@@ w@@ kan was waiting , as more than 700 prot@@ esters , who had been arrested in the same incident , four years in prison for a trial date .
recently , his trial was postpon@@ ed to 20 May because the prison administration failed to bring the accused from prison to the cour@@ t@@ room , according to human rights groups .
Sha@@ w@@ kan threat@@ ens the death penalty due to one , so many human rights groups agree , mock load of among others weapons possession , illegal assembly , murder and attempted murder .
in another case , a criminal court in G@@ iz@@ a acqu@@ itted the two journalists H@@ any Sal@@ ah @-@ el @-@ De@@ en and Mos@@ ad Al @-@ Bar@@ b@@ ary . they were charged with their coverage of pro @-@ Mor@@ si &apos;s seat block@@ ade on Rab@@ a &apos;@@ a Al @-@ A@@ da@@ wi@@ ya square in Cairo .
the Court also reduced the punishment of the journalists Abdul@@ lah al @-@ Fak@@ har@@ any , Sam@@ hi Must@@ afa and Mohamed al @-@ Ad@@ ly , who were also arrested in the previous incident , from 25 years to 5 years .
inter@@ rog@@ ating Tunisi@@ an activists to in@@ filtr@@ ated documents
in May , Tunisi@@ an authorities spent six hours with the inter@@ rog@@ ation of Sam@@ i Ben G@@ har@@ bia , who is co @-@ founder of the independent media platform Na@@ wa@@ at and the Global Vo@@ ices Ad@@ voc@@ acy Project .
Ben @-@ G@@ har@@ bia was driven mainly to a continuous action plan . according to the plan , the plan comes from the President of the Republic , who , according to the plan , explicitly supports a controversial draft bill that would guarantee business people and during the former regime by dict@@ ator Z@@ ine el @-@ Abi@@ dine Ben Ali of corruption .
the document published on April 21 on the website of Na@@ wa@@ at th@@ rows a light on how the presidential plans for the support of the legislation look like .
Ben @-@ G@@ har@@ bia le@@ aned the nam@@ ing of his sources , stating Article 11 of the Tunisi@@ an press committee , which journalists have the right to protect their sources .
nevertheless , he appeared as a witness in the District Court of Tunis on May 09 .
does China want to force the users of social media to show their ID ?
according to new regulations of the Information Bureau of the People &apos;s Republic of China , the users of social media in China need permission before they write or share messages in social media .
in the Reg@@ ulations it is also stated that registration will be required with the full real name .
analysts suspect that this will allow the elimination of anonymous comments in social networks within social networks . it is still unclear how the authorities will apply these regulations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Chinese citizens have proposed in the social media to enforce these regulations only sel@@ ectively in order to protect citizen journ@@ alism and its independence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
can we see ourselves in &quot; We@@ Chat &quot; ?
not in Russia !
in May , the state cens@@ orship of Russia blocked access to the latest Chinese mess@@ aging app We@@ Chat .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to Ros@@ kom@@ nad@@ z@@ or , We@@ Chat failed to register with the state government as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; organizer of information distribution . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this term is part of a law from 2014 , thanks to which the Russian government conduc@@ ts a list of online services , which organize the &quot; publication of information . &quot; the law also allows the government to make use of said services to remove content and to force it upon request for termination of user data .
these websites currently include websites such as V@@ contacts and Od@@ no@@ class@@ ni@@ ki ( Russia &apos;s two most popular social networks ) , the image Board 2.@@ ch@@ .@@ h@@ k , the email service mail@@ .@@ ru and dozens of other services .
Turkish court decre@@ es Wiki@@ pedi@@ as
a Turkish court ruled Wiki@@ pedi@@ as in Turkey , after Wikipedia administrators refused to delete two English @-@ language articles , the data that Turkey supports the jihadi@@ sts in Syria .
the Turkish Ministry of Transport , Maritime Affairs and Communication admitted that the site was closed because it became an information source collabor@@ ating with groups to fom@@ ent a political de@@ fam@@ ation campaign against Turkey . &quot;
it is the first time that Turkey completely blocks the website . it is therefore , among other things , China , one of the few countries around the world where access to Wikipedia is not possible .
great Britain cannot stop sni@@ ff@@ ing
after this week , the UK government is in the midst of a targeted consultation with regard to increased surveillance powers that would force Internet service providers to monitor communications in real time and to install Backdoor programs that encryp@@ t data encryption .
the government has consul@@ ted telecommunications companies and secret services regarding the proposal , but has left other technology companies and civil society outside .
despite all this , the consultation will continue until May 19 . reactions and proposals by members of the public can be forwarded to the Ministry of the Interior .
