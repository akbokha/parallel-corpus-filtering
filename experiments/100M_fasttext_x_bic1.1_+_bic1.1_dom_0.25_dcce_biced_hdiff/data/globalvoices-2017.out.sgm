<seg id="1">Although I had visited the USA at least once a year since 2012, I would live there for the first time.</seg>
<seg id="2">And that was very exciting for me.</seg>
<seg id="3">My love for America is extraordinary.</seg>
<seg id="4">Like many of my generation I grew up with American movies, danced to American music, read American authors and run his sport.</seg>
<seg id="5">In fact, this country had such a profound effect on me that I became a journalist mainly because of an American film.</seg>
<seg id="6">At the age of 14 I saw the great Denzel Washington as he played the Gray Grantham in The Pelican Letter, a fearless reporter who, with the help of Julia Roberts, covered the murderous plot of an oil magnate who wanted to occupy the Supreme Court with judges who were inclined to occupy his interest.</seg>
<seg id="7">I was caught.</seg>
<seg id="8">"" "" "" "free according to Method Man," "" "" "" "It was as if this is the absolute truth, forget everything else, that's what I want to do with my life." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="9">And the year I lived in Arizona had only reinforced my admiration for the USA.</seg>
<seg id="10">I always said: "America is the only country in which I ever lived, whose diversity is so inviting that you can always be who you are and it is easy to find acceptance in a community of like-minded people.</seg>
<seg id="11">I even wrote a very sharp letter of love about his greatness.</seg>
<seg id="12">Then came Donald Trump.</seg>
<seg id="13">Much has been written about the xenophobia and racism of this man.</seg>
<seg id="14">The most extraordinary aspect of his ascension is for me how he deals with his narrow-mindedness.</seg>
<seg id="15">In his opinion he never stops behind the mountain as it is said so beautifully.</seg>
<seg id="16">He says exactly what he thinks like a former colleague, and openly declares his contempt for Muslims, Latinos, Afro-American and women.</seg>
<seg id="17">Nevertheless people responded to his statements and voted for him in droves.</seg>
<seg id="18">The 13 million votes he won in the Republican pre-elections was the highest number that a candidate nominated by the party ever reached.</seg>
<seg id="19">I was speechless.</seg>
<seg id="20">Who are the Americans who support this bigot person, I asked myself?</seg>
<seg id="21">I couldn't reconcile Trump and his voters to the people I had met in Phoenix during my time.</seg>
<seg id="22">For example, my professor, Dr. Bill Silcock, director of the journalism program that welcomes people from all over the world, a deep gullible person with whom I was able to talk about Islam and his past.</seg>
<seg id="23">Trumps Weltanschauung also did not agree with that of Peter Bhatia, the current editor of the Cincinnati Inquirer.</seg>
<seg id="24">Bhatia and I met our common love for basketball and we spent many hours watching the "Phoenix Suns" at the game.</seg>
<seg id="25">Trumps intolerance is also in contrast to the generosity I experienced at Sandy Bahr, who is fighting the environment for her life, and her husband Dave, my host family who treated me like her son.</seg>
<seg id="26">She still fits the engagement of Kristi Kappes, who always helped me with patience and grace and helped my colleagues to get used to the complexity of American life.</seg>
<seg id="27">Then there were Andrew Leckey, Kathryn McManus and Retha Hill, my mentors, whose wise advice helped me a lot in my career.</seg>
<seg id="28">These people and the values represented by them deepened my love for America.</seg>
<seg id="29">While Trump assaulted his way to the nominees Republican presidential candidates, they offered me a stop and the counterpart to his limited vision of America.</seg>
<seg id="30">It turned out, however, that they were the exception of the rule.</seg>
<seg id="31">On November 8, 2016 more than 50 million Americans, mostly white, the presidency of a man, despite - or perhaps because of his contempt against non-white people.</seg>
<seg id="32">The confrontation with the idea that people voted overwhelmingly because they either shared their racism and fanaticism, or because they were willing to overlook those things, broke my heart almost.</seg>
<seg id="33">Perhaps it is unfair to designate the trump voters as racists.</seg>
<seg id="34">To classify people, said one of my friends, is exactly what led us to this situation.</seg>
<seg id="35">This is superficial and respectful and implies an inability to understand those who act and think in a different way.</seg>
<seg id="36">It shows people that their worries and fears don't take into account the hectic changes in their communities.</seg>
<seg id="37">Could it be that these voters, most of whom are white, voted for Trump because they want to regain control over a country that has disappointed them?</seg>
<seg id="38">In other words, they might say they are still important in this America?</seg>
<seg id="39">Perhaps.</seg>
<seg id="40">However, one can hardly forget the words of David Remnick, who commenting the cruel decision to raise a man who looks down with contempt on those who look different than he.</seg>
<seg id="41">This "Whitelash" (note D): as much as "leaning the whites against all other ethnics," pun off white in allusion to the whites and whiplash, which means so much like shot trauma), as the great Van Jones called, has killed exactly what America did so magnificently.</seg>
<seg id="42">Millions of people around the world appreciate the American ideal - no matter whether myth or reality, it is nevertheless a powerful idea - which faith or background one may always have, America welcomes everyone.</seg>
<seg id="43">For this country chose as its president, twice the son of a Kenyan, whose history as he himself says, nowhere else in the world would be possible.</seg>
<seg id="44">With the election of Donald Trumps, however, there is a huge part of the White America that promises this promise and says: hell with diversity, religious freedom and the whole concept of pluralism.</seg>
<seg id="45">In America after 9 / 11 the white man is back at the helm, they say.</seg>
<seg id="46">In all this, I have to think of Khizr Khan, the father of a soldier who fell in Iraq, and what he said on the eve of the election.</seg>
<seg id="47">At a demonstration for Hillary Clinton, Mr. Khan had a word change with the crowd.</seg>
<seg id="48">"Donald Trump, would my son, Captain Humayun Kahn, have a place in your America?" Mr. Khan asked.</seg>
<seg id="49">"" "" "" "the crowd responded with a loud" "" "" "" "No!" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="50">"could Muslims have a place in your America?"</seg>
<seg id="51">"no!" the crowd roared.</seg>
<seg id="52">"do Latinos have a place in your America?"</seg>
<seg id="53">"no!" they answered.</seg>
<seg id="54">Do Afro Americans have a place in your America? "</seg>
<seg id="55">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "no!" "" "" "" "they cried and their voices were louder." "" ""</seg>
<seg id="56">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "would anyone who is not like you, a place in your America?" "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="57">"" "" "" "he received a unanimous and loud" "" "" "" "NO" "" "" ""! "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="58">Mr. Khan concluded with the words: "thank God, Mr. Trump, is not your America." 36 hours later he was rectified.</seg>
<seg id="59">The land for which his son was pleased sent him a message.</seg>
<seg id="60">This is now Trumps Land, said the news.</seg>
<seg id="61">And all the people who look like Mr. Khan, couldn't find a place in this new America.</seg>
<seg id="62">And that breaks my heart to me.</seg>

<seg id="66">From misery to the stars: these Latin American children cannot spoil their love for music through rubbish</seg>
<seg id="67">The "Recycled Instruments Orchestra" by Cateura, Paraguay, during a concert in Washington DC.</seg>

<seg id="69">What has the Mexican music school of the Vicente Guerrero Community in the Province of Oaxaca together with the children of the Paraguaan city of Cateura together?</seg>
<seg id="70">That the music that is played at both places not only changed the life of the children, but also a very close connection with...</seg>
<seg id="71">Music that lives with the waste</seg>
<seg id="72">Vicente Guerrero is located on the edge of a large garbage dump, just 16 kilometres south of Oaxaca & # 8212; an old colonial city that is very popular among tourists but worlds away from the nearby pre-Columbian ruins and its world-famous cuisine.</seg>
<seg id="73">For several years now the La banda de Música (music band) has been playing in the community: a symphony orchestra consisting of children and adults, which has found a way to overcome the surrounding poverty with their musical instruments.</seg>
<seg id="74">A music school with 100 students has become a central interest for the municipality of Vicente Guerrero in Oaxaca.</seg>
<seg id="75">The British newspaper The Guardian wrote about this project:</seg>
<seg id="76">The community, located in one of the poorest provinces of Mexico, is known for its drug abuse and the gangs of gangs.</seg>
<seg id="77">But this changed after a casual encounter with a French pilot who started a musical project and gave the youth a rare hope of hope.</seg>
<seg id="78">The young band members take their commitments to the music group very seriously, writes the local press Noticias Oaxaca NVI:</seg>
<seg id="79">As soon as they come from school they run back home and immediately after lunch they run through the dusty streets to pursue their great passion.</seg>
<seg id="80">You always come smiling and with shiny eyes and play in the hustle you learn day for day trumpet, trombone, piccolo, clarinet, oboe, flute, forest horn, timpani, bongos and the conga.</seg>
<seg id="81">Music from trash</seg>
<seg id="82">More than 7,000 kilometres south of Vicente Guerrero play the children of Cateura - a village practically located at the top of the largest garbage dump of Asunción in Paraguay's capital - on instruments made of recycled waste material:</seg>
<seg id="83">Music with remanufactured instruments, consisting of local solid waste materials, is produced in a workshop for musical instruments in Cateura, where the recyclers under the direction of Favio Chávez have started turning parts of waste into instruments.</seg>
<seg id="84">Instruments imitate violins, violas, cellos, double basses, guitars, flutes, saxophones, trumpets, trombones and drums all made out of the garbage.</seg>
<seg id="85">The repertoire includes classical music, folk music, paraguayan and Latin American music, as well as music of the Beatles, of Frank Sinatra, etc.</seg>
<seg id="86">In an article in the Los Angeles Times, Favio Chávez, a local ecologist and music teacher of the children of Cateura, recalls the early days:</seg>
<seg id="87">At first it was very difficult because we had no place for rehearsals and we had to teach at the same place where parents worked in garbage The children did not know any music and it was very difficult to contact the parents because many of them did not live together with their children.</seg>
<seg id="88">This changed when Favio was shown something he had never seen before: a violin-made violin.</seg>
<seg id="89">Today there is a whole orchestra that plays on instruments of remanufactured material and that is called The Recycled Orchestra.</seg>
<seg id="90">A documentation called "Landfill Harmonic" (Harmonic garbage dump) records the musical performance:</seg>
<seg id="91">Every year, the world generates about one billion tons of waste.</seg>
<seg id="92">Those who live with him and of him are the poorest - like the people in Cateura, Paraguay.</seg>
<seg id="93">And here they turn him into something beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="94">Landfill Harmonic follows the orchestra with its inspiring spectacle of trash-to-music around the world.</seg>
<seg id="95">The orchestra even played his music in front of Pope Francis:</seg>
<seg id="96">These East African countries show how technology and team work can successfully fight illegal fishing</seg>
<seg id="97">Photo © FISH-i Africa - a project that fights wild illegal fishing.</seg>
<seg id="98">This entry, written by Emma Bryce, was originally published at Ensia.com, a magazine that reports specifically about international, practical solutions for environmental problems.</seg>
<seg id="99">The re-release will be published as part of an agreement with Global Voices for sharing content together.</seg>
<seg id="100">In West Africa, it was known at that time that this ship had already had illegal fishing in the land of Liberia before it searched the other coast of Africa.</seg>
<seg id="101">The East African countries were accordingly upset and little inclined to welcome a law breaker of this kind on their coasts.</seg>
<seg id="102">In Kenya, Tanzania, Mauritius, the Comoros, Mozambique and the Seychelles, they quickly mobilized against the ship. they refused to ship one of their ports and refused to give him a fishing permit.</seg>
<seg id="103">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "suddenly the prime minister was surrounded by countries that simply refused everything," "" "" "" "Benedict Kiilu, a senior employee of the Kenyan fishing authority, is part of a team that discovered and persecuted the ship at that time." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="104">In 2013, the ship was then driven out of the waters of the region: he was not able to catch fish there.</seg>
<seg id="105">In the end, it was also obliged to pay 2 million US dollars to Liberia, because of pillage of the fish stocks of the country.</seg>
<seg id="106">The core of this initiative, which crosses criminal practices and protects resources, was FISH-i Africa: a network of countries, founded in 2012 by the NRO Stop Illegal Fishing (illegal fishing).</seg>
<seg id="107">The members of this network are in addition to Somalia and Madagascar the six countries that had expelled the Premier from their waters at that time.</seg>
<seg id="108">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "we have eight countries that are like-minded and work together." "" "" "" "says Tony Long, head of the Pew Charitable Trust Project Ending Illegal Fishing. this project provides technical support for FISH-i." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="109">Illegal fishing is unregulated by definition: what is caught is hidden, therefore it is extremely difficult to track down. this makes illegal fishing a major cause of overfishing in regions.</seg>
<seg id="110">By the intentional disregard of existing laws, by which certain habitats and species are to be protected, illegal fishing ecosystems can damage ecosystems that have a delicate balance.</seg>
<seg id="111">But while actions against illegal fishing had once been hampered by bureaucratic hurdles and also by the snail speed, with the information between individual countries circulating, actions happen nowadays in real time, with traceable to FISH-i's digital communication platform.</seg>
<seg id="112">There, for example, the individual countries can exchange lists of existing licenses, news on suspicious activities or details that were noticed or experienced during a port inspection.</seg>
<seg id="113">Fish-i also draws attention to the activities of ships when they move around the open sea using satellite data.</seg>
<seg id="114">This makes it possible for the authorities to identify ships that fish in prohibited areas, such as those that suggest that a ship will load its caught fish on the road to other ships.</seg>
<seg id="115">Ideally, such studies show whether the ships involved have a fishing license, where they were on the way and possibly whether they have a criminal record.</seg>
<seg id="116">Countries that are against illegal fishing can then refuse to accept such information in their ports on the basis of this information. which means that the ships cannot sell their cargo, and that they can even be forced to pay penalties, as in the case of the prime minister.</seg>
<seg id="117">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "it's about substantial financial losses for the owner, which means that illegal fishing is not worthwhile financially." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="118">And that's what we want to achieve, "says Per Erik Bergh, senior director of NFDS Africa. the latter is a consulting firm that advocates the fight against illegal fishing in Africa and also supports FISH-i.</seg>
<seg id="119">A closed front</seg>
<seg id="120">The already mentioned platform was created to gain an estimated $20 million lost in revenue lost by the eight members of the HISH-i network each year because of illegal fishermen who enter East African waters.</seg>
<seg id="121">East Africa has one of the most productive tuna fisheries, which attracts the region's commercial fishing from all over the world.</seg>
<seg id="122">Their practices include activities such as sailing under false flag, fake license papers, specification of fantasies, fishing protected species and fishing in nature reserves.</seg>
<seg id="123">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "they deliberately exploit the lack of international co-operation and exploit the weaknesses of a completely organised control system," "" "" "" "says Long." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="124">"" "" "" "but another country could say" "" "" "" "Come to me" "" "" "". "" "" "" "" "and this legal hiding place attempts to close FISH-i." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="125">Until now, the closed front is working.</seg>
<seg id="126">Since its foundation, FISH-i has been involved in more than 30 studies of suspicious ships.</seg>
<seg id="127">It has uncovered criminal networks that had distributed fake licenses in Tanzania. it discovered ships that used several fraudulent identities and it has pursued and found escaping ships.</seg>
<seg id="128">Due to his cooperation with INTERPOL, the international authority to combat crime, FISH-i can share and maintain information on illegal fishing over large distances.</seg>
<seg id="129">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "some of our investigations lead us quite far into the networks of organized crime," "" "" "" "says Bergh." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="130">It builds a system that will help FISH-i to locate suspicious ships more precisely.</seg>
<seg id="131">Photo courtesy of FISH-i Africa.</seg>
<seg id="132">Fish-i's satellite system, which is constantly being developed, also helps to detect the illegal vessels that would like to hide.</seg>
<seg id="133">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "illegal fishermen use very sophisticated techniques to hide their activities and their position." "" "" "" "we try to cross this," "" "" "" "says Duncan Copeland, chief analyst at Trygg Mat Tracking, an NGO that also deals with fisheries data and offers FISH-i technical support." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="134">Some of the ships, for example, switch off their automatic identification systems with which they can no longer be ordered by satellites.</seg>
<seg id="135">Copeland therefore helps build a system that connects different levels of information. it is intended to help FISH-i find criminal ships with greater precision.</seg>
<seg id="136">A model program</seg>
<seg id="137">But can FISH-i's team of African nations really influence the unquestionably global problem of illegal fishing?</seg>
<seg id="138">John Amos, President of NRO SkyTruth, believes this.</seg>
<seg id="139">Recently, SkyTruth has opened the Global Fishing Watch platform together with Google and the Oceana Marine Protection Organisation: a platform that provides satellite data and can be displayed anywhere in the world by means of the ship's position.</seg>
<seg id="140">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "getting together with the neighbours to get a better picture of who is doing - that simply makes sense," "" "" "" "he says." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="141">"" "" "" "we should do this on a global scale." "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "Pew Charitable Trusts has a similar project to run in which a global system allows tracking ships." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="142">There are signs that FISH-i's activities are not only detecting criminals but also deterred them.</seg>
<seg id="143">Ships that used to be confiscated without a license and had little to reckon with consequences now know they are being watched.</seg>
<seg id="144">According to Kiilu, some of the countries involved in FISH-i have meanwhile recorded a 33% increase in fishery sales since fishing boats are purchasing more licenses.</seg>
<seg id="145">After FISH-i Somalia had helped detecting Greko 1, the inspectors found on board towing networks, whose use is forbidden.</seg>
<seg id="146">Photo courtesy of FISH-i Africa.</seg>
<seg id="147">Other countries also see these successes. "the effect is so strong that we now also copy other countries," says Kiilu. "we have become a study object." in West Africa, several hundred million dollars are lost annually by illegal fishing.</seg>
<seg id="148">There are six countries joined in 2015, the so-called West Africa Task Force. they are also fighting illegal fishing, according to exactly the same model as FISH-i. "" With security, the aim is to create even more such initiatives and structures in other regions, "says Copeland.</seg>
<seg id="149">Recently, FISH-i's youngest member state Somalia has been able to announce his first major triumph: in October, it was Greko 1, a ship that was on the road under false flag. and not only was the ship on the road without a licence and were used by towing nets which are now banned.</seg>
<seg id="150">The ship was also invaded in forbidden waters reserved for fishermen from Somalia. "" with the take of measures against Greko 1, they set a strong sign that they would go against illegal fishing, "says Bergh.</seg>
<seg id="151">For FISH-i, this is another success of many. and at the same time the proof that such a special collaborative way of working to protect the oceans actually works across the oceans. Emma Bryce is a freelance journalist and lives in London.</seg>

<seg id="153">The street movements in Venezuela seem to be only the beginning of a wave of violent demonstrations.</seg>
<seg id="154">They are considered to be a protest against the government's decision to stop the referendum on the presidential election of President Nicolás Maduro.</seg>
<seg id="155">This picture of María Alejandra Mora shows a close-up of the demonstration in Maracaibo in 2014.</seg>

<seg id="157">After the government of Venezuela rejected the application of the opposition to a referendum on the detachment, the Venezuelans responded in whose eyes the negotiations on the political and economic crisis of the country ran into the void by gathering together on the streets.</seg>
<seg id="158">Under the hashtag # LaTomaDeVenezuela (for example: the reimbursement of Venezuela) can be found in both demonstrations and arguments for and against it.</seg>
<seg id="159">The debate is also being conducted in other parts of the country - including in the Barinas area, in the Andes regions Mérida and Táchira, in the central North of the federal state of Carabobo and on the Isla Margarita in the state of Nueva Esparta.</seg>
<seg id="160">The political and economic situation of the country continues to deteriorate, which is reflected in the daily life of the Venezuelans through an acute lack of food and medicines.</seg>
<seg id="161">Many representatives of the opposition saw the possibility of a fundamental change in the inauguration of the current President Nicolás Maduro, but in the end the reluctance of a re-election was blocked by the official authorities.</seg>
<seg id="162">Marianne Díaz, acting at Global Voices in Venezuela, summarises in her latest article the context of the government decision as follows:</seg>
<seg id="163">In the context of the social, political and economic crisis, where inflation and violence are among the highest in the world (the inflation rate is estimated at 500% for the annual financial statements) and in which a serious and far-reaching lack of food and medicine, the referendum was considered the only way to give the country a chance to regain its institutional structures and to close a new government alliance.</seg>
<seg id="164">The electoral alliance of Mesa de la Unidad Democrática or shortly MUD (for example: round table of the Democratic Union), in which the opposition parties and political groups merged. in addition, a twelve-hour strike on the torture day and a march to the Miraflores Palace, the Venezuelan government seat, was planned on 3 November, should continue to block the referendum on the detachment.</seg>
<seg id="165">The appeal was commented on Twitter, among other things, as follows:</seg>
<seg id="166">It is as long as Venezuela: tomorrow National Assembly, Friday nationwide civil war and on 3 November all to Caracas to the Miraflores Palace.</seg>

<seg id="170">The first demonstration in the context of the action programme "The reconquest of Venezuela" took place on Wednesday, 26 October.</seg>
<seg id="171">The images of the marches published in real time testify among other things an overwhelming participation of the people in numerous areas of the country, but also confrontations with policemen and supporters of the government.</seg>

<seg id="176">On Twitter, there are pictures that talk about confrontations as well as reports of oppression and abuse.</seg>
<seg id="177">Especially big waves struck the news about police repression in the centrally located town of Maracay.</seg>
<seg id="178">There the demonstrators moved back to the local Cathedral to protect themselves from the police and armed advocates of the government according to their own testimony.</seg>
<seg id="179">Hours later they could safely leave the cathedral, but the protests continued.</seg>
<seg id="180">In other parts of the country, some demonstrators tried to stop the police, including this woman in the Andean State Táchira:</seg>

<seg id="182">Meanwhile an infographic makes the round that forms the scale of oppression per day:</seg>
<seg id="183">Thus the dictatorship has suppressed the country.</seg>

<seg id="197">This is an adapted version of an interview from Alejo Gómez with Luis Quijano, which was published on 23 August 2016 on Día a Día, an Argentinean news page.</seg>
<seg id="198">The interview was translated into English and is published here with kind permission.</seg>
<seg id="199">When he was 15 years old, Luis Alberto Quijano was forced by his father to take a look at the atrocities in La Perla, a secret prison in the Argentine city of Cordoba.</seg>
<seg id="200">As an adult man, Quijano now spoke against his father as part of the Grand La Perla Ribera Process in the province of Cordoba.</seg>
<seg id="201">In the trial which ended on 24 August 2016, crimes committed during the Argentinean military dictatorship were investigated.</seg>
<seg id="202">Luis Alberto Quijano did not choose his life.</seg>
<seg id="203">Beginning with the burden of wearing the same name as his father, up to the brutal military operations in the prison La Perla, which he observed at the age of 15, he suffered enough.</seg>
<seg id="204">For 34 years he kept family secrets for himself.</seg>
<seg id="205">In the situation back then I thought that was right.</seg>
<seg id="206">I felt like a secret agent.</seg>
<seg id="207">As a child with 15 years, one does not notice that one is manipulated by his father.</seg>
<seg id="208">At that time I could not see that my father was a thief, torturer and murderer.</seg>
<seg id="209">Luis had no choice: his father Luis Alberto Quijano was a gendarmerist. during the Argentinean military dictatorship from 1974 to 1983, a time of state terrorism, his father was the Deputy Commander of the Intelligence Department 141 in the La Perla prison.</seg>
<seg id="210">Luis Alberto Quijano.</seg>

<seg id="212">This is not the story of Luis Quijano, the oppressor who is accused of abduction in 158 cases, torture, murder in almost 100 cases and the kidnapping of a 10-year-old child.</seg>
<seg id="213">No, this is the story of Luis Quixyanos son, a man who, over the years, recognized the extent of atrocities he had experienced as a boy, and who testified before a federal court against his own father.</seg>
<seg id="214">His story shows what great power a parent has over his child and how this child chose a path of salvation for himself.</seg>

<seg id="230">My father took me four times to La Perla, all in 1976.</seg>
<seg id="231">At the first and last time he let me wait at the entrance in the car.</seg>
<seg id="232">When he took me the second time, he ordered me to go out. he led me to a barracks, in the cars, furniture, TV, fridges - just anything possible - stood.</seg>
<seg id="233">All of it was stolen.</seg>
<seg id="234">He gave me a small package wrapped in a blanket and ordered me to carry it to the car. when I opened it, I saw that there was a great clump of silver.</seg>
<seg id="235">On that day I went to the other end of the barracks, where the stolen items were parked and kept me with a guard.</seg>
<seg id="236">Suddenly he pointed to an open space and said:</seg>
<seg id="237">There the prisoners are tortured.</seg>
<seg id="238">I sewed in and saw a lying on which people were tortured.</seg>
<seg id="239">It looked like a field bed and metal springs.</seg>

<seg id="298">She was like our pet, almost like a dog - only that this was a little girl.</seg>
<seg id="299">I repeatedly asked myself: they were tortured, but why were they killed?</seg>
<seg id="300">It would have been easy to put them into prison.</seg>
<seg id="301">I guess it was simply decided to kill these people, but why did their bodies disappear?</seg>

<seg id="347">In the Japanese city of Kyoto, customers of a newly opened centre in which one can extend his driving license, witnessed a particularly missuccessful translation last month.</seg>
<seg id="348">On a plate, the Japanese word was "" "" "" "older drivers" "" "" "", "wrongly - possibly also with bad rear thoughts and # 8212; translated as" "" "" "" "terrible drivers" "" "" "". "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="349">The wrong translation was to be read on electronic ads in the entrance area and in the building from 1 to 20 September.</seg>
<seg id="350">Edited the original photos by Joshua Levine, which was widely shared in the social media.</seg>
<seg id="351">The mistake was noticed by the translator Julian Holmes, a resident of Kyotos. he was also who made the local papers aware of it.</seg>
<seg id="352">The post-Kyoto daily Kyoto Shimbun wrote:</seg>
<seg id="353">"how could it come to such an English translation?</seg>
<seg id="354">This proves that no one has read the translation.</seg>
<seg id="355">"" "" "" "this is an insult to older people and in an international city like Kyoto is simply unacceptable," "" "" "" "Holmes said." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="356">The correct English translation was first removed. the term "terrible drivers" (German: "terrible drivers") was later replaced by the more appropriate, although grammatically not quite correct designation "elder drivers" (German: "older drivers").</seg>
<seg id="357">The Kyoto Police Department apologized for the translation error. furthermore, she explained that the mistake had already been contained in the text they had received from the translator and that the translation was not checked for correctness before it was published.</seg>
<seg id="358">A blogger told the following about the apology:</seg>
<seg id="359">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "we are really sorry that older people felt offended by the insufficient correction (translation) on our part," "" "" "" "said the police." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="360">The Japanese online news service J-Cast News deals with the phenomenon of "terrible" older drivers in Japan apart and wrote:</seg>
<seg id="361">The word "awful" was denounced as an inappropriate description of older drivers. according to the police, the proportion of elderly drivers who are involved in accidents all over the country is a matter of concern.</seg>
<seg id="362">In the Kyoto Prefecture, for example, 1,941 of 19,460 accidents were caused by seniors in 2005, representing a proportion of 10%.</seg>
<seg id="363">Ten years later, in 2014, senior citizens created 1,803 of 11,850 accidents.</seg>
<seg id="364">This increased its share to 17.7%.</seg>
<seg id="365">While the number of accidents decreased overall, the proportion of accidents caused by seniors increased during the same period.</seg>
<seg id="366">The unnamed Reporter brought comments on the light in the article published on Yahoo, showing what prejudices some Japanese apparently heap against older drivers:</seg>
<seg id="367">The article on Yahoo via the translation error has among other things received the following comments:</seg>

<seg id="376">The reasons for the wide spread of translation errors are manifold.</seg>
<seg id="377">For translating, you need two important skills: passive language skills to understand the original text and to translate active language skills to translate it into the target language.</seg>
<seg id="378">The latter requires the active control of the target language - something that is the case with native speakers. generally, the conviction that translators should be in the target language - not in the original language - should be native speakers.</seg>
<seg id="379">For example, a French native speaker should translate from English into French - not from French to English.</seg>
<seg id="380">Photo by Flickr user Karl Baron.</seg>
<seg id="381">Many Japanese companies do not employ people with English as their mother tongue, who could make translations into English. this may be due to lack of understanding for translating, cost reasons or the relatively small number of English native speakers who learn Japanese.</seg>
<seg id="382">Some companies, who do not have foreign employees themselves, can still make translations in-house. then the Japanese co-worker, whose English knowledge is the best, is made to the translator - no matter how good or bad his language skills are really.</seg>
<seg id="383">Photo by Flickr user Karl Baron.</seg>
<seg id="384">Mechanical translations are also widely used - often with funny results.</seg>
<seg id="385">The verbatim sentences, which arise through machine translation, show that this technique does not replace a human translator for a long time. this is especially true for some languages.</seg>
<seg id="386">Some of the strangest English formulations in Japan, including the enigmatic prints that often decorate t-shirts or bags, are used for stylistic reasons - not to be read or even understood.</seg>
<seg id="387">Photo by Flickr user Joseph Brent.</seg>
<seg id="388">Translation errors may be acceptable or at least harmless as jewellery. however, by large companies or from the government who have the means to ensure higher standards, it is possible to expect more accurate translations.</seg>
<seg id="389">In the future, the city of Kyoto will hopefully use a more serious source for its translations.</seg>

<seg id="391">Main page of the portal "Navegar con Libertad" (Free Surfing) of IPYS (Instituto Prensa y Sociedad, Institute for Press and Society).</seg>
<seg id="392">On Friday morning, 7 April, Venezuelan Internet users reported that they would not have access to the Vivoplay online channel.</seg>
<seg id="393">Later, other users wrote that the internet appearances of VPITV and El Capitolio TV were no longer available.</seg>
<seg id="394">Other online broadcasters also recorded recordings of the protests in Caracas organized by opposition groups who opposed the government of Nicolás Maduros.</seg>
<seg id="395">The protests began at the beginning of April, after the Supreme Court dissolved the parliament and transferred the Parliament's duties to the executive and the Supreme Court itself.</seg>
<seg id="396">Luis Carlos Díaz, journalist and author at Global Voices, published the results of a traceroutes. he pointed out that the connection was tapped, and advised the users to use VPN (virtual private networks) to get access to the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="397"># Zensur: activates your VPN.</seg>
<seg id="398">It seems that the Internet pages of Venezuelan providers have been closed again.</seg>
<seg id="399">This is from the @ VivoPlayNet site.</seg>
<seg id="400">Offers such as Vivoplay are popular among Venezuelans with Internet access, especially in times of unrest.</seg>
<seg id="401">Traditional media have been hesitant since 2014 when reporting on protests. at that time, the Commission threatened to punish them with fines and closures if they continued to report on the demonstrations, as the Commission saw this as a "call to violence."</seg>
<seg id="402">Without cable TV and informational national TV channels, I registered at @ vivoplaynet again.</seg>
<seg id="403">Amazing that it is still cheaper to buy two litres of lemonade.</seg>
<seg id="404">The local NGO VEsinfiltro later confirmed that not only Vivoplay was inaccessible by blocking the Domain Name System (DNS), but also two other online channels. this also concerns the website where the National Assembly transfers its sessions.</seg>
<seg id="405">Previous research at the Institute for Press and Society (IPYS), a research group for digital rights in Venezuela, had revealed that local internet providers sometimes use DNS. this is a technique by which the DNS servers respond to requests of certain domains flawlessly.</seg>
<seg id="406">If a web site is blocked by the DNS, the server will respond erroneously or deny the request when calling such a website.</seg>
<seg id="407">We confirm a DNS lock: @ elcapitoliotv, @ VPITV and @ vivoplaynet</seg>
<seg id="408">At VPITV, a third blocked channel, the transmission was set on Thursday, April 6, when the VPITV camera man Elvis Flores, who carried the protests in Caracas live, was arrested.</seg>
<seg id="409">Flores was beaten while he was in police custody.</seg>
<seg id="410">Eight hours later he was released, and VPITV went on stream again.</seg>
<seg id="411">Although some channels are still accessible via YouTube, it has also been reported that the government regulates internet connections: this makes the Venezuelan access to multimedia coverage more and more difficult.</seg>

<seg id="416">The following article is the shortened version of a structural, published by Global Voices with kind permission of the authors.</seg>
<seg id="417">The article is part of a series entitled "Vacas que vuelan, Escuelas que Caen" ("Flying cows, falling schools"), edited and republished by Global Voices of Latin America.</seg>
<seg id="418">Tina Alvarenga lived for eight years in a household where she was not allowed to eat together with the family living there.</seg>
<seg id="419">Shortly before her graduation at the university she returned to the house and heard the owner of the house full of pride about her. "she is like a daughter for us.</seg>
<seg id="420">"" "" "" "she said," "" "" "" "she said," "" "" "" "she said." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="421">But Tina Alvarenga was never treated like a daughter in this house.</seg>
<seg id="422">When she was ten years old, she began to work as a criadita for the family. as Criaditas, the more than 46,000 boys and girls who are forced to work to go to school are called Criadita.</seg>
<seg id="423">The business is quite simple: a big family with little money transfers their underage son or their underage daughter to another, more abundant family. in exchange, the child receives food, a training and a roof over his head.</seg>
<seg id="424">What is not mentioned, however, is that the children will have to perform countless days of housework that will never be paid and victims of abuse and abuse - and all that within the framework of a contract that one cannot lift up.</seg>
<seg id="425">This practice referred to as Criadazgo is widespread in Paraguay because of its participation and acceptance by large parts of society and despite numerous complaints by human rights organisations.</seg>
<seg id="426">After graduating, Alvarenga worked for a few years for an organization that fights for the rights of boys and girls.</seg>
<seg id="427">She spoke with Criaditas - especially young girls are affected by the practice of criadazgo - collected testimonies, researched and denounced.</seg>
<seg id="428">She tried to name things by name, because the feeling of gratitude, which is inoculated by the Criadita, generally guarantees silence.</seg>
<seg id="429">"the Criadazgo is based on a double deception," says Alvarenga.</seg>
<seg id="430">On the one hand, the family, whose daughter is in the belief that she will complete her training, improve her position in society and "make something out of herself" can be transferred to another family.</seg>
<seg id="431">On the other hand, the family, who assimilates the girl with him and justifies its exploitation with the faith, is that they give someone a chance that would otherwise have no education and might even be starved.</seg>
<seg id="432">The victims of the Criadazgo</seg>
<seg id="433">When the girl is abused, his family will learn about it many years later.</seg>
<seg id="434">Sometimes they never experience it.</seg>
<seg id="435">In January 2016 the previously unknown phenomenon, which takes place in the hidden in paraguayan households, got a face.</seg>
<seg id="436">When Carolina Marín came to hospital in Caaguazú, her body showed signs of violent blows. shortly afterwards she died.</seg>
<seg id="437">She was 14 years old.</seg>
<seg id="438">She was Criadita in the household of the former military citizen Tomás Ferreira and his wife Ramona Melgarejo, who works as a civil servant at the Population Register.</seg>
<seg id="439">Marín was living with them in their house in Vaquería, a small village with only 3,000 inhabitants located 250 kilometers east of the capital Asunción.</seg>
<seg id="440">At the end of January 2016, Ferreira took on a stick on Marín as long as she suffered lethal injuries.</seg>
<seg id="441">This should be the last punishment in the life of the young girl.</seg>
<seg id="442">A few days later, the media reported on the incident.</seg>
<seg id="443">They stressed that the murdered child was a criadita.</seg>
<seg id="444">Organizations such as UNICEF or Callescuela made the practice of criadazgo deep in the Paraguayan society responsible for the death of the girl.</seg>
<seg id="445">They designated the Criadazgo as "a modern form of slavery."</seg>
<seg id="446">Several dozen people came to protest meetings and demanded that there be no further Carolina in Paraguay.</seg>
<seg id="447">The girl's name and photos were widespread in social media.</seg>
<seg id="448">"in Paraguay, more cows are registered as children," complained Tina Alvarenga.</seg>
<seg id="449">Without documents it is much easier to violate the rights of children without impunity.</seg>
<seg id="450">Without official documents it is very difficult to control under what conditions boys and girls live.</seg>
<seg id="451">The neighbours of the married couple and almost 60 civil society organisations called for a swift investigation of the case.</seg>
<seg id="452">They want Tomás Ferreira and Ramona Melgarejo to be sentenced to 30 years in prison for the murder of the girl who was her Criadita.</seg>
<seg id="453">If the case occurs in court, the case of Carolina Marín could be furious - if for the first time in the history of Paraguay a case of Criadazgo comes before court.</seg>
<seg id="454">The everyday life of a Criadita</seg>
<seg id="455">The Criaditas are exploited not only as labor, they also live isolated from other girls at their age.</seg>
<seg id="456">Tina Alvarenga was ten years old when the Farbik, where her father worked, had to sign up bankruptcy and her father lost his job.</seg>
<seg id="457">Their brothers had to go all the way and began selling sweets on the street or on the market to earn money.</seg>
<seg id="458">But they all went to school.</seg>
<seg id="459">Only Tina was sent as Criadita to the capital Asunción.</seg>
<seg id="460">In the house of her employers, Alvarenga worked between four and six hours every day.</seg>
<seg id="461">She had to divide the time in such a way that she was still time to learn.</seg>
<seg id="462">She rose up every morning at five o'clock and prepared breakfast for her employers.</seg>
<seg id="463">On Friday, for example, they cleaned the fridge, cleaned the living room, polished the furniture and disinfected the floor.</seg>
<seg id="464">When the school was finished, she went home again and had time to learn.</seg>
<seg id="465">The sooner she was finished with learning, the more free time she had.</seg>
<seg id="466">But even this time was limited because she had to make dinner for her employers.</seg>
<seg id="467">Alvarenga says she never had to starve, but she didn't get unlimited food. "I was allowed to get more books from the master's library as food from the fridge," she remembers.</seg>
<seg id="468">The library was well equipped and belonged to the landlord, a former military and sympathizers of the partido Liberal, a liberal party that belonged to the opposition during the dictatorship of Alfredo Stroessner, who was in power from 1954 to 1989.</seg>
<seg id="469">On some evenings, the landlord Alvarenga forced him to stand next to him and read editorial from the opposition newspapers such as "Sendero" or "El Pueblo."</seg>
<seg id="470">He tried to persuade them to not believe the reports of the official media about the dictator regime.</seg>
<seg id="471">He thought she was intelligent, but didn't stay with her. "the host found someone who listened while he talked about politics," she says.</seg>
<seg id="472">"they didn't often allow me to visit my family because they thought that I would get" bad habits "there again." they said that Alvarenga, which belongs to the indigenous group of the Guarani, would return home to Guarani's native language again at home.</seg>
<seg id="473">Their masters were afraid that they would lose the education they had made possible, they explain.</seg>
<seg id="474">But she was fully aware that she had paid for everything she got from them with their hard work.</seg>
<seg id="475">Also at school, Alvarenga was discriminated against. "one thing that is almost never talked about is mobbing and the harassment that criaditas are exposed when they go to school.</seg>
<seg id="476">Because the other children have parents, they immediately realize that someone who has no parents is a criadita.</seg>
<seg id="477">I couldn't invite anyone to visit me at home. I had no circle of friends at school or in the neighborhood.</seg>
<seg id="478">In my youth, in the time when friendships arise, I felt particularly clear that I was not a member of any group.</seg>
<seg id="479">Isolation was the worst of all, "says Alvarenga.</seg>

<seg id="496">(Criaditas, for how long?), a collection of testimonies of former Criaditas, writes Ortiz:</seg>
<seg id="497">In the course of our history we managed to abolish systems such as slavery, Cuñadazgo (a practice from the early history of Paraguay), where the Spanish conquerors, the Conquistadores, the women of Guaraní were enslaved and subjected to Spanish indoctrination) and the system of the Spanish Conquistadores (where the Spanish conquerors had to pay tribute to them) and the Spanish conquerors went into a system of slavery, where they become light victims of abuse and exploitation.</seg>

<seg id="507">The bill, which consists of six paragraphs and is curated in local media including Youm7 and Egypt Independent, defines social media as "any application that runs and uses over the Internet to communicate with others by voice, video messages and text."</seg>
<seg id="508">It is unclear how the law is enforced when it is accepted, as the draft does not indicate how Egyptian authorities should impose the registration on users. it is also unclear how they should account for those who do not register in view of the fact that the Egyptian government is currently not able to ensure regulation on the level of social media companies.</seg>

<seg id="525">High up in the mountains of Kurdistan in the north-east of Iraq, the animal protector Hana Ahmed Raza and her team of scientists from the NGO "Nature Iraq" are working to protect the ghostly Persian leopards.</seg>
<seg id="526">A subspecies of the greater leopard family, which wipes through Africa and Asia, belongs to the Persian leopards (Panthera Pardus saxicolor). altogether, there are between 800 and 1,000 animals, so the International Union for Conservation of Nature. they are endangered due to poaching, loss and fragmentation of their habitat and since they find ever less loot.</seg>
<seg id="527">Why is this particular species of leopards so important?</seg>
<seg id="528">As Raza shows in the video, "the Persian leopard is the only remaining predator in the Kurdish ecosystem," and the health and thriving of the ecosystem also depends on the fact that there is a big predator.</seg>
<seg id="529">The chance to actually see a Persian leopard is small and goes against zero. when the team in the video determines that they have a big cat in the camerafall, Raza breaks out in pure joy.</seg>
<seg id="530">As a trained biologist, Raza loves to show a different side of her country, which consists not only of war and conflict.</seg>
<seg id="531">She has been involved in field studies on wild animals and educational programs in Nature Iraq for six years.</seg>
<seg id="532">Since 2013, it has been a member of the IUCN / SSC Cat Specialist Group and is committed to ensuring that protected areas for wildlife in the Kurdistan region are established.</seg>

<seg id="539">"view from Shizugawa High School on Shizugawa, Minami Sanriku (Miyagi)."</seg>
<seg id="540">Shizugawa was destroyed by the tsunami on 11 March 2011 and still deals with the reconstruction of the region.</seg>

<seg id="544">In early March 2017, Kahoku Shimpo, the responsible daily for northeastern Japan, documented the progress made over the past six years to rebuild the lives of those affected by the "triple catastrophe" in March 2011. a massive earthquake, a tsunami and an atom accident in Fukushima had caused disaster.</seg>
<seg id="545">The Kahoku Shimpo newspaper has its headquarters in Sendai, located in Miyagi Prefecture. Miyagi prefecture was a local prefecture in Japan's northeast, which had to experience both the earthquake and the tsunami.</seg>
<seg id="546">Hundreds of thousands of people from Miyagi and the neighbourhoods Fukushima and Iwate were evacuated, because the tsunami had caused whole coastal towns to disappear from the map.</seg>
<seg id="547">In addition, Fukushima prefecture experienced a nuclear accident, and already alone 160 000 inhabitants had to leave their homes.</seg>
<seg id="548">From a local perspective, the Kahoku Shimpo's special report shows which progress has been achieved six years later in order to rebuild the lives of local residents.</seg>
<seg id="549">The detailed report of the paper includes both the statistics of the Japanese reconstruction authority and the survey results of the affected persons themselves.</seg>
<seg id="550">The housing situation in Fukushima, Miyagi and Iwate</seg>
<seg id="551">The Kahoku Shimpo newspaper reports that up to December 2015, 77 per cent of the planned replacement houses ("saigai kouei juutaku") were completed in the Fukushima, Miyagi and Iwate prefectures.</seg>
<seg id="552">Miyagi was able to see the biggest success among the three prefectures, here 80 percent of the planned spare houses were completed.</seg>
<seg id="553">Iwate has completed 75 percent of such houses whereas Fukushima forms the final light by 70 percent.</seg>
<seg id="554">However, even six years after the catastrophe, we still endeavour to resettle into final replacement houses six years after the disaster.</seg>
<seg id="555">After the threefold disaster almost 80,000 people saw themselves forced to live in lodging establishments.</seg>
<seg id="556">In December 2016 more and more people from Miyagi, Fukushima and Iwate still lived in such dwellings.</seg>
<seg id="557">Almost 40 percent of those evacuated from Fukushima in 2011 still live in emergency shelters, whereas Miyagi was more successful. more than 75 per cent of the evacuees, who were living after the disaster in lodging establishments, were relocated to final homes.</seg>
<seg id="558">For Iwate, the figure is 34 percent.</seg>
<seg id="559">The state of work and everyday life in the three prefectures concerned</seg>
<seg id="560">As the Kahoku Shimpo newspaper was able to determine, 1074 of 1,100 schools that were affected by misfortune have opened their doors until December 2016, which accounts for almost 98 percent of the three prefectures schools.</seg>
<seg id="561">Six years later, it is clear that industrial reconstruction in the three prefectures is much more difficult.</seg>
<seg id="562">While nearly 100 per cent of the fishing ports in Iwate and Miyagi are now in operation, only 30 percent of the fishing ports have resumed their operation in Fukushima.</seg>
<seg id="563">The tsunami and the nuclear accident have affected large areas in the three prefectures of Agriculture.</seg>
<seg id="564">Miyagi was able to restore 93 percent of its agricultural areas, with only 66 percent of arable land in Iwate and less than 50 percent destroyed farmland in Fukushima.</seg>
<seg id="565">It is unlikely that this is only a consequence of the nuclear accident, because only 690 hectares of land-destroyed farmland of Fukushima is located in the "nuclear lock zone."</seg>
<seg id="566">In two of the three prefectures the tourism has recovered largely, but also here Fukushima stays far off.</seg>
<seg id="567">The tourist numbers in Miyagi and Iwate are up to 90 per cent on the same level as before the disaster. Fukushima, on the other hand, can only show 75 percent.</seg>
<seg id="568">However, the Kahoku Shimpo newspaper also reports that since the disaster almost half of the coast inhabitants, it is more difficult to make a living.</seg>
<seg id="569">Is the native population prepared for the next great earthquake?</seg>
<seg id="570">In order to be able to determine the overall picture, the newspaper has conducted numerous surveys among the local population and among the evacuees. she questioned her about the state of reconstruction and how her empathy has changed over the tsunami risk.</seg>
<seg id="571">In their introduction to the article, the Kahoku Shimpo newspaper explains:</seg>
<seg id="572">The Kahoku Shimpo conducted a survey to learn more about the tsunami awareness among the local population.</seg>
<seg id="573">The survey showed that 83.1 percent of local residents have taken measures to prepare for future earthquakes and tsunamis.</seg>
<seg id="574">However, 55.9 percent of those surveyed said that still not enough in disasters prevention was done.</seg>
<seg id="575">As for those who had to evacuate the Fukushima prefecture</seg>
<seg id="576">In its issue on the anniversary of the earthquake, the Kahoku Shimpo newspaper has also focused its attention on the situation of the evacuees from Fukushima.</seg>
<seg id="577">Fukushima had to experience not only the enormous earthquake and the devastating tsunami, no, Fukushima prefecture also witnessed the worst disastrous, nuclear accident that Japan had ever had to experience.</seg>
<seg id="578">Of 160,000 evacuees from Fukushima, nearly 63,000 people were transferred to areas outside the prefecture.</seg>
<seg id="579">At the beginning of 2016 some more than 23,000 people, back to Fukushima, were ennobled into permanent replacement houses.</seg>
<seg id="580">After the state of 2017 still 40,000 inhabitants of Fukushima live outside their home prefecture.</seg>
<seg id="581">In the disaster areas most of the evacuees, who still live under administrative skills, are older than 50 years old. they are well known because efforts to rebuild Miyagi, Iwate and Fukushima need to compete with massive construction projects. these are construction projects that are part of the Olympic Games that will take place in Tokyo by 2020.</seg>

<seg id="583">When people meet people from other countries who speak a different language, the differences seem to be greater than the similarities.</seg>
<seg id="584">However, after a while one recognizes that a more connects than it seems at first sight.</seg>
<seg id="585">These global connections are important, as they challenge our prejudices, expand our perspectives and remind us that the world is ultimately very small.</seg>
<seg id="586">In this episode of Into the Deep, the Global Voices Podcast, we look closely at these global connections. in our Into the Deep Podcast we deal with topics that often get less attention in reporting than they deserve.</seg>
<seg id="587">We speak to five Global Voices members who recall a moment in which they have felt very strongly connected with someone beyond language and country borders.</seg>
<seg id="588">Veroniki Krikoni talks about the common ground of Greek and Turkish; Tori Egherman explains how a migration has consolidated its affection for the Iranian culture; Adriana Macias talks about the time when she worked with people from all over the world in London; and Joey Ayoub looks back on his experiences that he has collected in a small village in Madagascar.</seg>

<seg id="593">Left: the attack against Mateus Ferreira da Silva. photo: Luiz da Luz. release with permission.</seg>
<seg id="594">Right: Mateus Ferreira da Silva on a widespread photo.</seg>
<seg id="595">A Brazilian student at the age of 33 was delivered this week to the intensive care unit: last Friday, a police officer during a demonstration in Goiânia had beaten him against his head during a demonstration in Goiânia. nationwide, millions of demonstrators took part in a protest march against austerity measures.</seg>
<seg id="596">Mateus Ferreira da Silva, who studied social sciences at the University of Goiás, has suffered a skull-brain trauma and several fractures.</seg>
<seg id="597">Doctors have operated on this Saturday and have now transferred him to an artificial coma.</seg>
<seg id="598">His condition is considered critical.</seg>
<seg id="599">The local photo journalist Luiz da Luz made photos of the attack on Mateus, which spread rapidly in Brazil within a few days.</seg>
<seg id="600">On the pictures is also the face of the police officer who attacked with a baton. the man was identified as Augusto Sampaio.</seg>
<seg id="601">After the incident, the military police in the Brazilian state of Goiás announced that Sampaio was suspended until the conclusion of the investigation into the incident.</seg>
<seg id="602">The pictures show the police officer how he strikes in Goiânia with his stick on the face of the student Mateus Ferreira (photos: Luiz da Luz).</seg>
<seg id="603">If a police officer was beaten by a demonstrator and landing on the intensive care unit, his face would be on television for six months and the entire repression would be justified.</seg>
<seg id="604">The Facebook page "Desnealizador," a press channel of media activists from Goiânia, shared the video recorded by Luiz da Luz on the net in which one sees how Mateus is attacked by the police officer and several paramedics suddenly hasten to it.</seg>
<seg id="605">Another video filmed with the same scenes but filmed from another perspective is also dipped into social networks.</seg>
<seg id="606">In the clip shown below you can see the attack on Mateus from the 50th second.</seg>
<seg id="607">For the family of Mateus, who lives in another state, Internet users have now donated 10,000 Brazilian Reais (about 2,700 euros) to cover a part of the cost of medical treatment and to allow his family to stay in Goiânia while he is in hospital.</seg>
<seg id="608">"be brave, Mateus.</seg>

<seg id="610">The drawing was shared several times in social networks.</seg>
<seg id="611">By: Heitor Vilela. publication with permission.</seg>
<seg id="612">On Facebook, Professor Pablo Ortellado calls for further violence against activists in Goiás:</seg>
<seg id="613">Goiás experiences a wave of political violence: here, the activist Guilume Irish was assassinated by his father, because he supported the Occupy movement in secondary schools. here, the Military Police of a WhatsApp Group was accused of criminalising the Occupy movement. and now we have the very sad case of Mateus Ferreira da Silva who was attacked by a police officer who had struck him with a hammer.</seg>
<seg id="614">Police Handles</seg>
<seg id="615">Goiás was not the only country in Brazil where brutal police action against demonstrators passed last Friday.</seg>
<seg id="616">Police officers were deployed in protests in the centre of Rio de Janeiro, where demonstrators had set up a stage for speakers, rubbers and tear gas.</seg>
<seg id="617">The MP Flavio Serafini, Socialist and Peace Party (PSOL), asked the police to refrain from violence against demonstrators via speaker announcements.</seg>
<seg id="618">This includes a report in Folha de S. Paulo, one of the oldest newspapers throughout the country.</seg>
<seg id="619">Once again, the Brazilian media have disguised street protests by directing the focus to another unexpected protagonist: a windshield.</seg>
<seg id="620">The Folahs de S. Paulo and Estado de S. Paulo were specifically reporting on a broken glass window to illustrate their title pages illustratively.</seg>
<seg id="621">On the other hand, the O Globo preferred a cover story with a bus set in fire.</seg>
<seg id="622">There is no plausible journalistic reason to report more about a broken window of windows than the protests of thousands of people serving a special cause.</seg>
<seg id="623">This must also be recognised if one is strictly opposed to any form of damage.</seg>
<seg id="624">Here, too, the term "vandalism" gets an absurdity, disproportionate significance, and the typical acts of violence of the military police are obscured by headlines with the title "protesters on confrontation course with the police."</seg>
<seg id="625">The villages in Cuba that are forgotten by the deduction</seg>
<seg id="626">With the introduction of the Álvaro Reynoso law, almost hundreds of sugar cane factories in all of Cuba closed the doors (Photo: Julio Batista)</seg>
<seg id="627">The folk community Gregorio Arleé Mañalich, located in the western Cuban province of Mayabeque, is generally known as el Central - in Spanish sugar mill, despite the fact that there is no notable sugar harvest locally.</seg>
<seg id="628">It is two years ago when the activities in the sugar cane factories were paralysed.</seg>
<seg id="629">After exhaustion, the sugar cane industry was still in the region, and the factory gradually lost its facilities until only the steel and concrete scaffolding remained.</seg>
<seg id="630">About 272 workers had to invent themselves anew.</seg>
<seg id="631">Some changed the work.</seg>
<seg id="632">Others resigned and commute every day to factories that still grind.</seg>
<seg id="633">Nene, a soldier veteran who rises every day at 4: 00 o'clock in the morning, the crisis in the sugar cane industry doesn't rob his sleep.</seg>
<seg id="634">He heard that there are sugar cane factories in the east of the region, which are back in operation after a long inactive time, because they were received.</seg>
<seg id="635">That was something he did not expect.</seg>
<seg id="636">Nene remembered that Mañalich would receive the sugar cane Factory, but the promise was not kept.</seg>
<seg id="637">The sugar cane industry has withstood the plagues, the fall of socialism, the low market prices, inefficiency, poor management decisions and climate change.</seg>
<seg id="638">In 2016, production amounted to 1.6 million tonnes of sugar, less than the quantity produced in 1910.</seg>
<seg id="639">The news would have been a subject of alarm for the country some decades ago, but the bad harvests are no longer a novelty.</seg>
<seg id="640">Why was the Cuban sugar cane industry switched off?</seg>
<seg id="641">The old railway platform of the municipality already saw better times.</seg>
<seg id="642">(photo: Julio Batista)</seg>
<seg id="643">The reduction of the sugar cane industry was an economic necessity: the 155 sugar cane factories were technically outdated, and barely competitive, they became unbearable for the country.</seg>
<seg id="644">The initial idea was to concentrate production on the most efficient factories, the annual production target was 4 million tons.</seg>
<seg id="645">They left only the factories that could produce sugar for at most 4 Centavos (0.03 Euro).</seg>
<seg id="646">The solution for unemployment?</seg>
<seg id="647">The motives that led to such measures were the low productivity of sugar cane plantations and the sugar crisis on the global market.</seg>
<seg id="648">However, sugar prices rose again about a decade ago.</seg>
<seg id="649">From 2017 to 2025, the price of unrefined sugar must remain between 15 and 16 Centavos per pound, according to the report published in 2016 by the OECD and FAO, the United Nations Agricultural and Food Organisation.</seg>
<seg id="650">If the current production would reach the level of 2001 (3.6 million tonnes), the raw sugar export would generate approximately 85 million dollars for the country.</seg>
<seg id="651">Not everything went well</seg>
<seg id="652">"today's day will certainly go into history," these were the first words of Cuban President Fidel Castro during his speech on October 21, 2002 at the sugar factory in Lavandero.</seg>
<seg id="653">From then on, the process of restructuring began in the sugar industry.</seg>
<seg id="654">In the following years, the shutdown of a total of 98 sugar cane factories, more than 65 million people, received their full salaries for further education.</seg>
<seg id="655">The same thing happened in the Gregorio Arlée Mañalich sugar cane factory on May 14, 2004.</seg>
<seg id="656">Luis Alberto Pérez has been working in the factory since 1967.</seg>
<seg id="657">When Nene, as he is known as a soldier, talks about the closure of the factory, the word he repeats most is "deceit."</seg>
<seg id="658">Almost all respondents said: not one of them was informed that the factory would be shut down.</seg>
<seg id="659">In order for the place to be preserved, they formed a full-time working group.</seg>
<seg id="660">Before the first graduation year, the first letters began to come.</seg>
<seg id="661">These were officially recorded documents, which were only differentiated with regard to the parts that would be removed, the addressee and the date.</seg>
<seg id="662">All were signed by Ulmich Rosales del Toro, only the Minister could approve any withdrawal.</seg>
<seg id="663">From then on, responsibility was postponed and the letters became more and more frequent.</seg>

<seg id="689">First Nations young people use hip-hop to express themselves and preserve their own culture</seg>
<seg id="690">Inclusion of a song from "Home to Me" - Grassy Narrows First Nation.</seg>

<seg id="692">Young people of the First Nations communities across Canada deal with topics that are important to them. they do this using hip hop thanks to a series of hiking workshops.</seg>
<seg id="693">As part of the N'we Jinan tour, workshop leaders have been bringing mobile audio studios directly to schools and youth centres to teach youth groups songwriting, recording, audio and video production and live performances.</seg>
<seg id="694">The original workshops were led by the educator David Hodges who lives in Montreal and worked in North Quebec with ten Cree communities and then collaborated with the Cree Hip-Hop Group The Northstars.</seg>
<seg id="695">The workshop thus assumes that the young participants discuss topics such as "cultural identity, language, conflict, love, acceptance," or whatever comes to mind.</seg>
<seg id="696">These questions are inspiration for songs and videos in which the young people are the protagonists.</seg>
<seg id="697">Because the workshops were so popular, the team worked with other First Nations Communities in the Canadian province of British Columbia and was invited to organize similar workshops with the tribe of Winnebulago in the US state of Nebraska.</seg>
<seg id="698">This video of the school 'Na Aksa Gyilak' Yoo in the area of the tribe of the Kithumkalum First Nation in British Columbia, for example, tells the story of Highway 16, also called "Highway of tears," a road section in western Canada, on which nearly two dozen mostly indigenous young women were disappeared or murdered.</seg>
<seg id="699">The cases were largely unknown.</seg>
<seg id="700">The next video of the Nemaska Cree First Nation uses the motif of a video game to convey how important it is to preserve traditional customs and customs despite the influences of globalisation.</seg>
<seg id="701">Many of the songs appeared in indigenous languages, although the young people are not always able to master the languages of the First Nations.</seg>
<seg id="702">In the following song that the Whapmagoosti Cree First Nation has recorded, the chorus is sung on Cree.</seg>
<seg id="703">The young people involved got some help from Gary Jolly from the Northstars Hip-Hop group, who gave them a verse in the Eastern James Bay Cree dialect.</seg>
<seg id="704">On the Facebook page of N'we Jinan the verse is available as well as a translation into English, which is translated into German:</seg>
<seg id="705">Sometimes I feel like nobody ever is interested in me</seg>
<seg id="706">But I try to keep my days on earth</seg>
<seg id="707">This is the day when you will hear our cry</seg>
<seg id="708">Because we as a youth have lost our way in life</seg>
<seg id="709">But I believe that we will rise one day</seg>
<seg id="710">I don't want to see how they live a bad life</seg>
<seg id="711">So they can grow and go forward as well as our youth</seg>
<seg id="712">So they can do what they intended for the Creator</seg>
<seg id="713">In the comments section, the reader and supporters of the Cree-language Kevin Brousseau also make a contribution and add the verse in syllable (which is also published on his blog and is published here with permission):</seg>

<seg id="718">In Japan, you can see plastic dishes almost every restaurant.</seg>
<seg id="719">To show potential customers what is on the menu, near the entrance shokuhin sanpuru ("plastic models of dishes") are issued by each dish served in this restaurant.</seg>
<seg id="720">Customers will see these plastic courts and decide whether they will enter or continue the restaurant.</seg>
<seg id="721">There is a whole industry dedicated to the manufacture of these plastic dishes.</seg>
<seg id="722">There are a number of small companies in the Tokyo district of Kappabashi, who are producing those plastic dishes that the German filmmaker Wim Wenders documented in his film Tokyo-Ga more than 20 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="723">For most Japanese, these plastic dishes are so common that they don't even notice them anymore. however, a new trend is turning them into showy mobile accessories and other gadgets.</seg>
<seg id="724">In Naver Matome, the blogger itinii published a series of social media links and photos showing this unusual twist with the shokuhin sinpuru.</seg>
<seg id="725">Now in special sale: new mobile tape decorated with plastic ribbons, as shown in the Kichijoji Tokyu department store.</seg>
<seg id="726">Many of these artificial food items were converted to kitschy collection objects, as in this case, fridge magnets:</seg>
<seg id="727">Here are some shokuhin fridge magnets for a new exhibition at the Tokyo Station.</seg>
<seg id="728">The new boom in essences is becoming increasingly sophisticated.</seg>
<seg id="729">In this case an kaisen-don (a popular rice dish with seafood) has been transformed into a mobile phone stand.</seg>
<seg id="730">For this triangular Bowl (lol) we found a good use as a mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="731">We have also made this part of the exhibition at the Tokyo railway station.</seg>
<seg id="732">And here is an apple that holds your cell phone:</seg>
<seg id="733">Designed to look like an apple, with a notch for the mobile phone, this is already a great design.</seg>
<seg id="734">And that's just the beginning of an increasing flight into the comic.</seg>
<seg id="735">Some mobile telephones and mobile designers allow you to create your own work of art. in this case, ikura or salmon roam is used, a popular topping that is served with white rice.</seg>
<seg id="736">On Twitter, some users had their doubts:</seg>
<seg id="737">Is there anyone who would say: "wow, cool, now I can decorate my cell phone with laughter?"</seg>
<seg id="738">I think I will be the only one.</seg>
<seg id="739">This interest in plastic courts can also take on a less appetizing form, for example to surprise colleagues or family members unpleasant.</seg>
<seg id="740">Our latest mobile phone stand has the form of melting ice.</seg>
<seg id="741">In addition, there are also rice balls (Onigiri), earrings and handybands from dried salmon.</seg>
<seg id="742">Other bizarre plastic dishes can be seen at: itinii's Naver Matome blog post. or follow Twitter the hashtag #.</seg>
<seg id="743">If you would like to learn more about the origin of this trend, this video gives you an insight into the district of Kappabashi, which is devoted to the supply of the restaurant industry.</seg>

<seg id="749">In reports of domestic and foreign media about the notorious "fight against drug trafficking" in Mexico, the extremissts and killed frequently only appear in statistics but these do not reflect the extent of the human tragedy that this struggle entails.</seg>
<seg id="750">The coverage of drug bosses such as El Chapo Guzmán, the leader of the Sinaloa cartel, totally pushed the stories of the victims of the conflict into the background.</seg>
<seg id="751">The day after a violent incident, hardly anyone looks at the grieving or the churches that have learned to live with the pain.</seg>
<seg id="752">Behind each corpse, behind every bone find in the hundreds of secret graves, the stories of countless parents, sons and daughters, friends and partners whose wounds may never be healed.</seg>
<seg id="753">This is why the Mexican news portal Animal Político has launched the digital project "Aprender a Vivir Con El Narco" (German: "living with drug trafficking"), which is supposed to give a voice to these victims and stories of people who were involved in the struggle between law enforcement agencies and cartels.</seg>
<seg id="754">Animal Político describes the project so:</seg>
<seg id="755">Organized crime does not only allow us to fear our lives.</seg>
<seg id="756">The effects are far more profound.</seg>
<seg id="757">For example, when businesses close because they are threatened by drug traffickers and entire communities need to drive many kilometres to buy something as simple as milk.</seg>
<seg id="758">The pain of the victims</seg>
<seg id="759">A video with the title "Vidas que Cambian por el miedo" (German: "how fear life changes") tells exactly these stories.</seg>
<seg id="760">A main character is Guadalupe, a father who searches for secret graves after his son every weekend.</seg>
<seg id="761">Or Emma Veleta Rodríguez, who lost her father only one day, her four siblings, her husband and two of her nephews.</seg>
<seg id="762">Priests: "like every Sunday we prepare ourselves today for the task we have set ourselves to go and look for tombs, the people we have loved."</seg>
<seg id="763">Guadalupe Contreras: "my son is called Antonio Ivan Contreras Mata.</seg>

<seg id="767">On 13 October, he left the house.</seg>
<seg id="768">On October 15th he should be back again, but he never returned. "Emma Veleta:" it is very difficult for me, because I am now alone with three children who need a training.</seg>
<seg id="769">There is also my mother, who is here with me as well.</seg>
<seg id="770">At the moment she has no income.</seg>
<seg id="771">You are the insurance of my father, but she does not pay it out because they require a death certificate.</seg>

<seg id="775">The project is based on stories of readers and reports by journalists in high-risk areas.</seg>
<seg id="776">Here are some excerpts from the stories.</seg>
<seg id="777">KYHB, a reader of Animal Político, wrote this post from Taxco, in the state of Guerrero in Central Mexico.</seg>
<seg id="778">Your contribution reminds us that violence should never be regarded as normal, no matter what form it occurs:</seg>
<seg id="779">I have known illness and sensational journalism for a number of years now.</seg>
<seg id="780">I come across newspaper kiosks every day and see the pages with images that actually only come from a textbook for criminology or from files from specialists.</seg>
<seg id="781">It brings me out of the frame.</seg>
<seg id="782">Sometimes I feel as if I am the only one who is disgusted or sad. it works like a lack of respect for the person who once belonged to this body.</seg>
<seg id="783">I can't be indifferent or consider this to be normal.</seg>
<seg id="784">She writes on:</seg>
<seg id="785">No, it's not normal that my 10-year-old cousin thinks he wants Narco (German: drug dealers) when he is big. and it is also not normal that people hear songs about the "heroic" of the offenders when they go through the streets.</seg>
<seg id="786">For me it is as if they ridiculed those who have lost someone and those who fear that something happens to them.</seg>
<seg id="787">I see our weakness, when stories become mere figures in a statistic.</seg>
<seg id="788">The insomnia of the people is incredible for me, when the death of six people and the disappearance of 43 students in a neighboring village are justified by the fact that they were "soaked."</seg>
<seg id="789">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "I think they try to convince themselves that they are spared from such tragedies when they are not stirring and still." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="790">Maribel L. from Mexico City wrote the contribution "Four months blackmail in the Capital District: how a family was plundered with threats." in this she describes how armed criminals were blackmailed for month money from their business until they had torn apart the business, but also torn off their family apart.</seg>
<seg id="791">You are thinking about everything you have lost and how some people can completely change your entire life in just a few days.</seg>
<seg id="792">The pain never passes, the trauma remains, the fear comes up again when you are alone.</seg>
<seg id="793">Habits have changed, phone numbers too.</seg>
<seg id="794">We only contact us if it is absolutely necessary.</seg>
<seg id="795">The farther we are from each other, the better.</seg>
<seg id="796">She closed her report with the words:</seg>
<seg id="797">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "we want the others to be arrested because they don't know when they will deceive or kill you." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="798">I asked myself in these awful days whether crying would dissolve my deep-rooted feelings, but the answer is no, because I forgot how to weep. I must learn to live with the pain.</seg>
<seg id="799">"" "" "" "the journalist Mario Gutiérrez Vega published the article" "" "" "" "The forgotten children of Ciudad Juárez" "" "" "". "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="800">In the introduction, he raises questions like: who cares for the child of a missing woman and a man who was murdered by organised crime?</seg>
<seg id="801">How is it to grow up in a settlement on the edge of Mexico's most dangerous city?</seg>
<seg id="802">He is not like other boys of his age, whose parents care about them.</seg>
<seg id="803">Bryan is a orphan and he says he had to teach himself how to cook an egg, sown potatoes, make tortillas warm and make Chichi for the babies who live with him. this is his name for the preparation of the bottles with water, sugar and milk powder.</seg>
<seg id="804">He tells of the nine scars on his left leg - one for each year of life.</seg>
<seg id="805">But they are insignificant compared to the pain in his eyes - unspeakable for a boy for whom all life consists of violence and who had to learn to live with it.</seg>
<seg id="806">When he was five years old, he told him that his mother had disappeared.</seg>
<seg id="807">But this was not the day when his childhood ended.</seg>
<seg id="808">His childhood was past two years before, when he was only a few blocks away from his home, seeing the bloody corpse of his father who had been shot by armed men from a passing car.</seg>
<seg id="809">When Bryan was born, the situation in Juárez looked like this:</seg>
<seg id="810">Bryan was born in 2006, when violence was violated by organised crime and the struggle against the already existing social problems in Juárez.</seg>
<seg id="811">In 2008, 2009 and 2010, Juárez was the most dangerous city in the world due to the number of murders according to the Public Security Council and Government of the Government of the United States.</seg>
<seg id="812">In 2010 alone, the public prosecutor's office amounted to 3103 killings. this corresponds to an average of 8.5 murder per day.</seg>
<seg id="813">These are just a few of hundreds of thousands of stories that leave the organized crime in Mexico and penetrate the soul of the country.</seg>
<seg id="814">Only a few stories continue to live in the face of ever new headlines. however, this project reminds us of those we are not allowed to forget.</seg>
<seg id="815">In addition to the project "Aprender a Vivir Con El Narco," Animal Político 2015 launched the data journalism project Narcodata, whose objective is to illustrate the complex information behind the failed fight against drug trafficking, which has tormented the country during the last four decades.</seg>

<seg id="817">"sharing is Caring" by Flickr user Niklas Wikström (CC-BY-NC 2.0) WARNMENT: this article and the pages that he links include images on which violence is depicted.</seg>
<seg id="818">The fact check is important in a moment when it comes to raising a rumor or exposing a fake.</seg>
<seg id="819">But what about the years after something has appeared? content in social media, whether true or untrue, tends to continue to exist.</seg>
<seg id="820">Take this photo of a terrible accident seven years ago in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC).</seg>
<seg id="821">Since its first publication, it has been misleading to manipulate tragedies that have actually taken place in Nigeria or Myanmar.</seg>
<seg id="822">This incorrect coupling of picture and event - "false description" or "false context" in the terminology of Global Voices or First Draft News - does not deny the fact that there is ample careful reporting on events in the DR Congo, Myanmar and Nigeria.</seg>
<seg id="823">But it raises questions about our desire for images of news.</seg>
<seg id="824">What happened in the Democratic Republic of the Congo</seg>
<seg id="825">In 2010 a tank truck crossed the town of Sange in the east of the DR Congo, tilted around and exploded. 230 people died.</seg>
<seg id="826">After the civil war, Africa's second-largest country has been neglected and devastated for years. roads in the region have become a dangerous path full of potholes that were difficult to navigate.</seg>
<seg id="827">Tragically, the tank wagon fell victim to it.</seg>
<seg id="828">Officials described a fireball that enveloped dozens of houses, including a movie theater nearby, which was full of people watching the World Cup.</seg>
<seg id="829">Houses scattered and charted corpses were scattered in the streets.</seg>
<seg id="830">Many people were incinerated for unrecognizability.</seg>
<seg id="831">A picture with the title "This is Nigeria." from the Imgur user Mystical Monkey, January 12th, 2015.Several photos of the incident portray the dreadful scenes of this day.</seg>
<seg id="832">Above is an example of this.</seg>
<seg id="833">It shows rows of carbonized bodies that are lined up on the floor while people look at them.</seg>
<seg id="834">But here the story does not end.</seg>
<seg id="835">Over the years, the same photo has been researched several times in social media, blogs and other platforms and falsely attributed to real but not related tragedies, especially events in Nigeria and Myanmar.</seg>
<seg id="836">What happened in Nigeria and Myanmar</seg>
<seg id="837">On 3 January 2015, combatants of Boko Haram attacked the remote Nigerian villages of Baga and Doro Gowon.</seg>
<seg id="838">Eyewitnesses dramatically reported atrocities to which they had to flee.</seg>
<seg id="839">Houses and shops were burned down and dead bodies lay in streets and bushes.</seg>
<seg id="840">There were reports, according to which 150 to 2,000 people were massacred.</seg>
<seg id="841">But the figures could not be confirmed. "nobody stayed back to count corpses," said a Human Rights Watch.</seg>
<seg id="842">Many were dismembered, shot or burned.</seg>
<seg id="843">The following time could only be illustrated by satellite images.</seg>
<seg id="844">The occasion for the attack was also unclear, but the army base in Baga was a permanent conflict between the military Nigerias and the attempt of Boko Haram to win the country (examples from 2013 and 2015).</seg>
<seg id="845">And here the picture emerged from the DR Congo again, when it was falsely presented as proof of the fact and possible extent of the attack:</seg>
<seg id="846">This is Nigeria.</seg>
<seg id="847">A massacre of 2,000 people took place two days after Paris.</seg>
<seg id="848">They are not Charlie.</seg>
<seg id="849">They are dead.</seg>
<seg id="850">Indeed, this abusive use of the image of the DR Congo is only one in a number of abortions; Africa Check has documented assignments to Nigeria since 2014.</seg>
<seg id="851">In all these cases the picture was presented as a proof of mass killings.</seg>
<seg id="852">One more step further, personal comments such as this example falsely relate the image of DR Congo with sources of the mass media in order to deliver arguments.</seg>
<seg id="853">The picture from Sange also appeared in conjunction with the deadly persecution of the Muslim Rohingya in Myanmar.</seg>
<seg id="854">According to a flash, published by the United Nations, those who fled could flee, rape and several dead, some by burning.</seg>
<seg id="855">While others reported about the violence against Rohingya, posts like the following appeared which brought these descriptions together with photos from the DR Congo:</seg>
<seg id="856">This picture comes from a Saudi Arabian news page, wrongly claimed by the president of Myanmar's Thein in 2012. monks and politicians had taken part in the murder of Rohingya Muslims. in addition, they had used the image of the DR Congo to model this information.</seg>
<seg id="857">The original contribution, which was finally accessed on 26 April 2017, can be viewed here.</seg>
<seg id="858">Other news organizations called AFP as their source also falsely attributed Thein to this statement, but did not have the image associated with the DR Congo.</seg>
<seg id="859">The worldwide range of false information</seg>
<seg id="860">Traces of this false coupling date back to 2011 and 2012 and are actually coming from all over the world.</seg>
<seg id="861">Using an "reverse image search," one can see how far information can transcend boundaries.</seg>
<seg id="862">An inverted picture search with the search engine TinEye has found 344 pictures under 18.8 billion pictures (as of May 3, 2017), which are very similar to the said picture of DR Congo.</seg>
<seg id="863">They come from a mixed masch of private pages, platforms of social media and common as well as national publications and are available in many different languages such as English, Russian, Spanish, Arabic, Dutch, German, Greek and Portuguese.</seg>
<seg id="864">Some have passed false reports, some have tried to expose counterfeits.</seg>
<seg id="865">We have delineated examples of abusive use and linked them to the respective countries, based on which side they were published. thus, we want to portray the range more clearly than by language alone.</seg>
<seg id="866">From the countries listed below (which in some cases were also linked with each other), several examples of improper use may date.</seg>
<seg id="867">Here are some cases that can now be completely sensed (on the map in orange):</seg>

<seg id="871">The grey countries are examples that, according to the metadata and information available via the TinEye, probably also show forgery examples.</seg>

<seg id="927">Frames and pictures</seg>
<seg id="928">There are two strong topics or frames (framing) that pass through these posts. the first frame focused on religion.</seg>
<seg id="929">The photo was used in relation to greater discussions about the silence in connection with the murders of Christians by Muslims or - for the defense of Muslims - the murders of Rohingyas by Buddhists.</seg>
<seg id="930">A second framing uses the image to discuss how an African life is undervalued compared to a European or French life.</seg>
<seg id="931">To understand religion and the value of human life is both important. therefore it is worth investigating how images are used in connection with these efforts.</seg>
<seg id="932">A deeper question, however, is what happens if readers can no longer believe these images.</seg>
<seg id="933">With social media, there are tens of people who have inadvertently share the water around a tragedy.</seg>
<seg id="934">Suggests this mood of false and falsehood that actual atrocities are untrue and diminishes the real horror of what has actually happened in the DR Congo, Nigeria and Myanmar?</seg>
<seg id="935">The dissemination of violent images has already been extensively debated (for example).</seg>
<seg id="936">One argument is that the retention of images of a refusal is equivalent to acknowledging the tragedy. sometimes these images are even demanded of the victims themselves.</seg>
<seg id="937">At the same time, the worry is that violent images will desensitize readers and spectators and take the ability to feel empathy (such as this study, which investigates how violent media are acting on helping others).</seg>
<seg id="938">While there is a lot to discuss in terms of violent portrayals in the news media, it is a fact that they are essential for today's news reporting.</seg>
<seg id="939">Technologists are experimenting with algorithms to support the fight against "fake News." they will have to think thoroughly about the situation in which a picture suggests something that can actually be used in context or in a completely abusive manner.</seg>
<seg id="940">However, each examination of false attributions should also take into account how international they can be.</seg>

<seg id="943">Photo by Andy Simmons uses according to CC BY-ND 2.0 license.</seg>
<seg id="944">A blog with the name untranslatable (e. g. unenforceable) endeavors to offer language enthusiasts a selection of words from around the world that are difficult or not to translate at all.</seg>
<seg id="945">These words are in every language: they express certain situations or feelings which are often very complex or specific.</seg>
<seg id="946">Some of these confusing words are already well known (like the famous Portuguese saudade) and others deeply rooted in a special culture (for example the Spanish Sobolesa).</seg>
<seg id="947">But all resist stubbornly every attempt of a simple translation.</seg>
<seg id="948">A word or expression is not enough, which is why a full explanation and sometimes some context are necessary to understand exactly what is meant by this one word.</seg>
<seg id="949">These unique words have been collected in an online list for quite a while.</seg>
<seg id="950">Most of these lists treat Japanese, German, French, Portuguese or Finnish words while the author and linguist chose "untranslatable" Steven Bird to focus on small languages.</seg>
<seg id="951">In the blog, for example, you can find words from Vanuatu Taxes, such as:</seg>
<seg id="952">"vakasteglok" - weary for your parents in recognition of your efforts in your younger years.</seg>
<seg id="953">And words in the Hunscile language spoken in parts of Brazil, such as:</seg>
<seg id="954">"kwadi" - Comfort or laziness that you feel after being warmed up in the sun on cold days.</seg>
<seg id="955">In Birds's own words from his blog About:</seg>
<seg id="956">They defuse other cultures, reveal other thoughts and awaken our curiosity.</seg>
<seg id="957">Sometimes you influence how we analyze the world around us and classify the linguists on this site even more of these "confusing" words and show how different, valuable and impressive these small languages are.</seg>
<seg id="958">Speakers of the Treasure Languages, highly valued by untranslatable, are invited to upload their favorite wines here.</seg>

<seg id="969">How Sri Lanka renders the worst flooding catastrophe of the decade</seg>
<seg id="970">The island state of Sri Lanka is currently facing the worst flood and flood disaster in this decade.</seg>
<seg id="971">Triggered by the monsoon, which normally ends in late May, the rivers Kalu, Kelani, Gin, Nilwala and Attanagalu Oya have trodden across the banks in 15 districts in the south and west of the country.</seg>
<seg id="972">After a statement by the catastrophment centre of Sri Lanka of 28 May 2017, 126 people were killed and scarcely hundreds of people are missing because of the floods and sludge winds.</seg>
<seg id="973">More than 400,000 people have been affected since last Friday (26 May) and around 100,000 people were transported to 304 safe places.</seg>
<seg id="974">The rainfalls continued on Saturday (May 27), and the water levels in some areas slowly declined.</seg>
<seg id="975">The health and hygiene conditions of the population represent a massive challenge in the affected and still inaccessible areas.</seg>
<seg id="976">The following pictures and videos convey an impression of the extent of the flood disaster:</seg>
<seg id="977">Flood in Tawalama town with water levels of up to 7.5 meters. Twitter users like Azzam Ameen and Sri Lanka Tweet provide regular updates on the flood situation.</seg>
<seg id="978">Many use the hashtag # FloodSL to monitor the extent of the disaster.</seg>
<seg id="979">Sri Lanka's deadly floods hammering the Dengue crisis, Save the Children after further rains are already on their way.</seg>
<seg id="980">Today morning the Neluwa Bus was in high water, water level up to 6 meters. village of Moragoda near Galle was also flooded due to the water level of the Morogoda Ela.</seg>
<seg id="981">The Air Force has provided five aircraft for rescue operations and another five are completed for the transport of emergency supplies for the inhabitants included in their flooded villages.</seg>
<seg id="982">Various organizations and startups have also agreed to help.</seg>
<seg id="983">Facebook pages such as Help Flood Victims in Sri Lanka and 2017 Disaster Relief - Information Desk- Sri Lanka provide important information on flood situations and humanitarian assistance.</seg>
<seg id="984">If any search and rescue teams need drones for their operations, please call 0774844639.</seg>
<seg id="985">For those who want to donate dry food and essential goods for flood victims -</seg>
<seg id="986">Today we are in the area around Keleniya and Himbutana.</seg>
<seg id="987">Please call the number 0777449729 or 0777843841 if animals need help in this field.</seg>
<seg id="988">The taxi call app PickMe (Sri Lanka) asks people to share their location data with the help of the app to inform the disaster center.</seg>
<seg id="989">Last year after the catastrophe of the Tropical Storm Roanu, PickMe introduced a "flood control" button that allowed users to call a vehicle to pick up assistance and donations. these were then sent to the srilankish Red Cross for free.</seg>
<seg id="990">They also introduced a "SOS" button, which resulted in more than a thousand requests and 150 successful boat rescue operations for humans trapped by floods and landslides.</seg>
<seg id="991">The united efforts of the government and the civilian population of Sri Lanka, where several social media platforms are fully exploited, bring people in need in safety and provide aid measures.</seg>
<seg id="992">This has prevented the loss of other human lives, with the population of Sri Lanka now the long way up to the restoration of normality.</seg>

<seg id="1002">I have already conducted this conversation.</seg>
<seg id="1003">People with whom I work or people who have known me for years separate me - the Sahar they know - from the widespread concept of "Muslims" that developed in their idea.</seg>
<seg id="1004">They demilitarize me.</seg>
<seg id="1005">There are 1.7 billion Muslims worldwide.</seg>
<seg id="1006">We don't all look the same.</seg>
<seg id="1007">We practice our religion differently.</seg>
<seg id="1008">We identify with it to be a Muslim, in different ways. but somehow we are all plugged into the same Muslim drawer.</seg>
<seg id="1009">This drawer is constructed in our collective imagination so well that as soon as Muslims, like me, do not fit into it, become Muslim.</seg>
<seg id="1010">To be Muslim</seg>
<seg id="1011">I don't steer with it alone.</seg>
<seg id="1012">This is even the poet whose poetry is most sold in America: Rumi.</seg>
<seg id="1013">Which pictures come to mind when you think of him?</seg>
<seg id="1014">Love?</seg>
<seg id="1015">Peace?</seg>
<seg id="1016">When Jalaluddin Rumi was as old as I am now, he was an Orthodox Muslim preacher and scholar.</seg>
<seg id="1017">Islam, the Quran and the Prophet Muhammad were the centre of his poetry until the day when he died.</seg>
<seg id="1018">But in the western conception the religion of Rumis was erased as well as from the most popular translations of his poetry.</seg>
<seg id="1019">This deleting makes a large part of the history of the 1.7 billion Muslims of this world.</seg>
<seg id="1020">Another consists in the reductionist images of Muslims, which have been colonising western books for centuries.</seg>
<seg id="1021">This enticing visual language is determined by the dark man you should fear and the exotic woman you should be saved.</seg>
<seg id="1022">The groundbreaking Palestinian-American scientist, Edward Said, defied the history behind these pictures in the 1970s.</seg>
<seg id="1023">But these pictures are protruding even today.</seg>
<seg id="1024">Our politicians, the news industry and Hollywood continue to perpetuate them.</seg>
<seg id="1025">I have worked for thirteen years in the news industry and I have seen how these powerful, flawed scars dominate our newsfeeds.</seg>
<seg id="1026">This narrative is overshadowing the reality that in the last three decades nine Muslim women have led their countries, while the US could not even choose its first female presidential candidate in 2016.</seg>
<seg id="1027">This narrative fails to acknowledge that when French, Muslim women are prevented from wearing their headscarf in public buildings and forcing Saudi Arabian, Muslim women by their government to cover their entire body, these are both sides of the same coin.</seg>
<seg id="1028">"" "" "" "a powerful group exercises his" "" "" "" "control" "" "" "" "on the" "" "" "" "other" "" "" "".</seg>
<seg id="1029">This strong narrative weakens Muslim women who make movements for change.</seg>
<seg id="1030">It is also evident that the first Muslim prayers were spoken on American soil by Africans who were hijacked with slave ships.</seg>
<seg id="1031">It deletes the existence of queer Muslims.</seg>
<seg id="1032">This narrative has filled our collective imagination so deeply and flawlessly, that often Sikh men and children become the target of anti-Muslim attacks and harassment.</seg>
<seg id="1033">Because of these stories that we tell and because of the way in which we relate it, Islamophobia is not just fear of Islam, religion, but fear of the "other."</seg>
<seg id="1034">Belonging to the 1.7 billion</seg>
<seg id="1035">In the news industry, we are dealing with more than just stories that are based on facts.</seg>

<seg id="1062">When social scientists describe religious life, they refer back to the following terms: faith, behavior and affiliation.</seg>
<seg id="1063">My Muslim faith and behaviour may not always be visible, but they are there.</seg>
<seg id="1064">Perhaps my girlfriend, my neighbour, would see my rock in the surf that I am Muslims when they could look through the 15 meter concrete and air that separate our houses.</seg>
<seg id="1065">She would see the ritual of the evening with my daughter, if I held her in my arms and her Arabic verses to protect her who seal the Koran and called the Quls.</seg>

<seg id="1073">Being Muslim means to talk to the prayers that she told me when I have a bad day.</seg>
<seg id="1074">To be Muslims is how they taught me to refer to God: Allah Mian, what God means, my only Lord.</seg>

<seg id="1118">And this moment has consequences that go beyond the 1.7 billion.</seg>
<seg id="1119">There is one reason that conspiracy theorists, who existed in the dark corners of the Internet, now lead the White House.</seg>
<seg id="1120">They have grown exponentially, because they have made Muslims to "others."</seg>
<seg id="1121">There is another group that has grown exponentially by creating the "other."</seg>
<seg id="1122">A few years before, they had not yet given them; now they dominate large areas in Syria and Iraq.</seg>
<seg id="1123">I am concerned about the realities and the history I was not aware of when I was as old as it is now my daughter, but who today made me an irrelevant Muslim.</seg>

<seg id="1130">We all have to ask ourselves why?</seg>
<seg id="1131">Why do I tell this here at this TEDx Talk 2017 in Stanford, where, however, Edward Said, the man who showed us how wars are being waged and people have been enthroned by creating the "other" in public performance, four decades ago even scientist of Stanford was.</seg>
<seg id="1132">We have to ask ourselves uncomfortable questions about the role of being conscious and unconsciously the "other"; as my girlfriend and I did in the rain during the Women's March, because the occupation that we have no president, the chocolate cake vomit, while he already bombarded broken lands and "to other made" people goes far beyond the visible and invisible 1.7 billion.</seg>

<seg id="1134">Initiative for narrative art wants to preserve urban language diversity</seg>
<seg id="1135">Storytelling, by Flickr user Daniele Rossi, using the license CC BY-NC-ND 2.0.</seg>
<seg id="1136">Can there be a way to contact someone here and now despite a language barrier?</seg>
<seg id="1137">For Steven Bird and Robyn Perry, founder of the Treasure Language Storytelling initiative (TLS), telling stories in their original language is a possible answer.</seg>
<seg id="1138">Global Voices reported recently about another initiative by Steven Bird, the confusing blog.</seg>
<seg id="1139">Here, however, the focus of TLS is not on the written, but on the spoken word. it is an attempt to preserve and dignify the language variety of large cities.</seg>
<seg id="1140">In fact, in urban areas such as Melbourne and Darwin in Australia or Oakland in the United States where TLS has held events since 2015, the risk that small and not so small languages are not passed on to the children born there.</seg>
<seg id="1141">The following applies to the makers of the project:</seg>
<seg id="1142">The mass mortality of the languages of the world can be avoided if we create cities that embrace diversity - secure spaces in which inhabitants do not have to forget who they are to belong.</seg>
<seg id="1143">While "listening" is often associated with "understanding" these events instead "listening in order to appreciate, to feel, to establish."</seg>
<seg id="1144">In this format storytellers first introduce their history in their own language and then translate or explain them in English.</seg>
<seg id="1145">Even if the participants are not a professional storyteller, their devotion and their presentation lead to the fact that the audience can count on them.</seg>
<seg id="1146">They cry out laughing and emotions as if the language is no longer a barrier.</seg>
<seg id="1147">The following video shows, for example, a traditional story from Burkina Faso, which is told in the language of Dafing. during this round, the storyteller Rassidatou conate takes the opportunity to explain the customs of narrative art typical for her country.</seg>
<seg id="1148">In another event John Nyamus tells us the fable of the rabbit and the baboon in the Shona language from Zimbabwe:</seg>
<seg id="1149">After explaining the importance of his ability, John Nyamus is asked: "how is it to speak to an audience that doesn't understand your language?" with a wide grin he shares his sense of inclusiveness:</seg>
<seg id="1150">You have listened!</seg>
<seg id="1151">They were attentive...</seg>
<seg id="1152">They were with me!</seg>
<seg id="1153">So far the events of Treasure Language Storytelling have taken place in three cities, and organizers hope to extend this. all who are inspired by the project can contact TLS to organize their own storytellers.</seg>
<seg id="1154">Puerto Rico calls on the US to reestablish public debt</seg>
<seg id="1155">With the aim of a re-examination of Puerto Rico's public debt, which rose to $72 million, various religious and civic organizations took part in a mass demonstration on April 3, 2017; the march started with the Moroccan Capitol, the government building of the capital, and went up to the Plaza de Colón in the old town of San Juans.</seg>
<seg id="1156">It was proclaimed by the Frente Ciudadano por la Auditoría de la Deuda (civic front for the re-examination of debts) and the ecumenical church meeting of Puerto Ricos.</seg>
<seg id="1157">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "the advocates of re-fixing the debt have also submitted a petition to the official homepage of the White House of the United States." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1158">This is their demand:</seg>

<seg id="1160">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "we demand a financial audit and a Steering Committee without any personal interest in public debt, with a fixed, our working conditions corresponding compensation, which acts in favor of the economy." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1161">We are blackmailed and suppressed.</seg>
<seg id="1162">The people of Puerto Rico refuse to pay a debt that is not theirs.</seg>
<seg id="1163">We will not choose between education and health.</seg>

<seg id="1167">Hence the so-called "Centre for New Economy," a non-profit non-profit organisation with no party affiliation with a focus on socio-economic development, is a law on state responsibility, as an alternative to the existing state view.</seg>

<seg id="1182">The Syrian-Palestinian web developer Bassel Khartabil, also known as Bassel Safadi, has been missing for over a year.</seg>
<seg id="1183">But he is not forgotten.</seg>
<seg id="1184">More than five years after being arrested by the Syrian regime, his supporters and relatives continue the campaign for his freedom and recall the contributions he made for an open network.</seg>
<seg id="1185">At this year's re: publicity, the annual conference on the digital culture that is hosted in Berlin, an event dedicated to the # FreeBassel campaign was dedicated.</seg>
<seg id="1186">Mélanie Dulong de Rosnay, a scientist of the CNRS Institute for Communication Sciences, and Barbara Rühling, managing director at Book Sprints, produced books within three to five days, read extracts from the book Cost of Freedom: a Collective Inquiry (The cost of freedom: collective research).</seg>
<seg id="1187">The book, published last year and available here royalty-free, contains a number of articles dealing with free culture in the face of oppression.</seg>
<seg id="1188">It's a tribute to Bassel and his work.</seg>
<seg id="1189">In the introduction, it reads:</seg>
<seg id="1190">This book aims to discuss how motions for free knowledge are built up and what are the real costs associated with this.</seg>
<seg id="1191">Activists, artists, designers, developers, researchers and authors who are involved in the movements for free knowledge have worked side-by-side to look beyond the fog that surrounds our newsfeeds and to create some sense of our different experiences.</seg>
<seg id="1192">This book is an attempt to free Bassel Khartabil, the beloved and celebrated Internet volunteer who has been detained in Syria since 15 March 2012.</seg>
<seg id="1193">His name was removed from the list of the Adra prison where he sat on 3 October 2015.</seg>
<seg id="1194">Since then, we have no information about his current status or location.</seg>
<seg id="1195">The introductory part of his book with the title collective memory gives his friends and family a voice that push for his release and who want to know him back in his normal life and freedom, right away.</seg>
<seg id="1196">Seeing how Bassel pays a high price for his participation in a free culture has let many of us start thinking about their own destinies, actions and decisions.</seg>
<seg id="1197">Why are we here today?</seg>
<seg id="1198">What did we choose for?</seg>
<seg id="1199">What have we given up in this process from time to time extreme beliefs?</seg>
<seg id="1200">The web developer for open source and digital activist has been in custody of Syrian government agencies since March 2012.</seg>
<seg id="1201">In October 2015, Bassel was transferred from the Adra prison, a non-military institution, to an unknown location.</seg>
<seg id="1202">His wife, the writer and lawyer Noura Ghazi, reported that the military police had taken Bassel on the basis of a "strictly secret" command of the military court from his cell in Adra. "</seg>
<seg id="1203">Ghazi reported that she had been contacted by persons who presented themselves as insiders of the Assad government and made aware of an alleged death sentence against her husband on 12 November 2015.</seg>
<seg id="1204">However, his place of residence and state remains unknown.</seg>
<seg id="1205">A pioneer of the Creative Commons in Syria and actively involved in projects such as Mozilla Firefox and Wikipedia, Bassel played a crucial role in expanding access to the Internet and knowledge for the public in Syria.</seg>
<seg id="1206">Barry Threw, a designer, technologist and currently the director of New Palmyra, a project that Bassel founded, writes on pages 10 and 11 of the book:</seg>
<seg id="1207">Perhaps nobody of Basle's cultural prototypes was more foresighted than the work he began with a group of archaeologists and 3D artists around 2005 to virtually reconstruct the ancient ruins of Palmyra.</seg>
<seg id="1208">Palmyra, one of the most important archaeological sites in the world, was the crossroads of numerous civilizations, and here Greek-Roman architecture melts with local traditions and Persian influence.</seg>
<seg id="1209">At that time, Bassel did not know that ten years after he began working with this work, the IS would do everything possible to wipe out the architecture that embodies not only the cultural heritage of Syria but the world.</seg>
<seg id="1210">This expedition into digital archaeology and conservation has created a time capsule that will be invaluable for the public as well as for scientists and artists in the future.</seg>
<seg id="1211">Tragically, Bassel couldn't finish this project until now.</seg>
<seg id="1212">Noura Ghazi has also contributed to the book and writes about her husband's passion to share his knowledge with others, even during his time in prison:</seg>
<seg id="1213">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "I spent my whole life dream of freedom and Bassel taught me to embrace her." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1214">I am overwhelmed when I call his name.</seg>
<seg id="1215">Bassel taught me English even when he was in jail.</seg>
<seg id="1216">I learned to read, write and speak English well.</seg>
<seg id="1217">He has always shared his knowledge with anyone who has asked. he has taught other prisoners to read, write and speak English.</seg>
<seg id="1218">Bassel opened the door to technology. he taught me to use both computers and smartphones.</seg>
<seg id="1219">He brought me the internet.</seg>
<seg id="1220">He also taught other prisoners, how they use computers, at least theoretically, without actually holding one in their hands.</seg>
<seg id="1221">Ghazi is also the author of Waiting (Waiting), a commission that she wrote to her husband in the years 2012 to 2015 when he was in detention.</seg>
<seg id="1222">Bassel and Noura worked together on the book for a year.</seg>
<seg id="1223">She smuggled the lyrics to him when she visited him and he translated it from Arabic into English.</seg>
<seg id="1224">The book is available royalty-free.</seg>

<seg id="1230">That I lose the mood in the moment in which we embrace,</seg>
<seg id="1231">That each of the dangers doesn't matter to me,</seg>
<seg id="1232">Each of the fences, shackles and guards</seg>
<seg id="1233">I forget the crush of the prison</seg>

<seg id="1235">Which I carry with passion with me,</seg>

<seg id="1239">To get back all the moments,</seg>
<seg id="1240">And to weep and smile about your absence.</seg>
<seg id="1241">I convince myself that I will return soon...</seg>

<seg id="1250">By 2016, at least 17,723 Syrians have died in jail since 2011 according to the international human rights organisation Amnesty International.</seg>
<seg id="1251">The stories of many other people remain unknown.</seg>

<seg id="1254">Mozambique: post-release Director, convicted of corruption, again on previous post</seg>
<seg id="1255">Mozambique reacted with anger on a corruption case, in which a member of the government returned to work in the state apparatus after half of his imprisonment in which corruption was committed.</seg>
<seg id="1256">It is Diodino Cambaza, who was arrested in 2008 and was sentenced to 22 years in prison together with four other defendants on account of misappropriation of 54 million Metikal (approximately 800,000 euros).</seg>
<seg id="1257">The money came from public funds from Mozambique airport, whose Council presided over Cambaza between 2005 and 2008.</seg>
<seg id="1258">Cambaza was released in 2016 for good management and immediately called for his re-adjustment to the company, which happened on 19 April.</seg>
<seg id="1259">In accordance with a statement by the Attorney General of the Republic, which rejected the application, there would be no barrier for Cambaza to resume his old posts because the company did not perform any disciplinary proceedings after his detention.</seg>
<seg id="1260">However, many inhabitants do not mean that the action is good.</seg>
<seg id="1261">In an interview with Deutsche Welle, the Centre for Public Integrity (Centro de Integridade Pública, CIP), a local institution dedicated to public transparency, condemned the company's decision to re-establish the director:</seg>
<seg id="1262">Represents a setback in the fight against corruption and exemplifies the lack of transparency and is even a regression with regard to the efforts of our legal system, such as the CIP.</seg>
<seg id="1263">What we take note of is that the company should have introduced a disciplinary procedure against the offenders.</seg>
<seg id="1264">The company, however, apparently kept silent and did not cause any reasonable legal steps to apply the appropriate functions.</seg>
<seg id="1265">Egídio Vaz, an important voice in the Muslim social media, also rejects this behaviour and considers the case as "refutable":</seg>
<seg id="1266">If Cambaza was a competent guy, he would be a consultant after he was sentenced to jail and half of which had been sued.</seg>
<seg id="1267">He could keep paid lectures and motivating speeches, he could deliberate and polish his image.</seg>
<seg id="1268">But since he is incompetent, he has consented to be reintegrated into the company he helped to inflict harm.</seg>
<seg id="1269">Therefore it is obvious: Cambaza is liked to be paid for his silence.</seg>
<seg id="1270">Contradictory!</seg>
<seg id="1271">Bitone Viage, young Mozambique and student of political science in Brazil says that the director does not have any moral:</seg>
<seg id="1272">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "Cambaza rewards the state because he insulted him." "" "" "" "I cannot believe that you are rewarded in such a way that the state has already so massively insulted the state." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1273">Cambaza lacks the return of morality and serves the state, * he had already had a unique opportunity to serve the state, but instead only served himself on the state.</seg>
<seg id="1274">Cambaza used the state to act as an inexhaustible source of money and the state itself became tired of this man who was charged and finally sentenced to a long prison term.</seg>
<seg id="1275">Honestly, I don't know why this man was rewarded in such a way.</seg>
<seg id="1276">Francey Zeúte prefers the Prime Minister of Mozambique, Samora Machel, to remind that a thief is in jail:</seg>
<seg id="1277">Thieves belong to the Prison Samora Machel and will not only be remembered for ever as the first independent president but also as a sharp, incisive and - by the way - prophetic orator.</seg>
<seg id="1278">One of his most famous oral representations was when he vigorously confirmed that "an ambitious man is capable of selling his own individual interest, even the fatherland for his ambitions, his own individual interest."</seg>
<seg id="1279">Samora also said: "I don't know if an ambitious man changes, my experience shows that it is not so. he changes the tactics, but he does not turn away from his ambitions.</seg>
<seg id="1280">"" "" "" "an ambitious man is at the same time criminal." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1281">In Twitter the reactions were also negative:</seg>
<seg id="1282">Cambaza was sentenced to 22 years in prison, he was 10 years old and free.</seg>
<seg id="1283">And today the company, in which he replies funds, resumes it again under contract. # AssigVaiOMeuPais - eg. αFeministianity (@ azmal _ Rafik), May 12, 2017</seg>
<seg id="1284">Emildo Sambo from the journal @ Verdade (to German: @ Truth) states that criminality pays off in Mozambique:</seg>

<seg id="1286">Facebook blocks the racist word "Kalar" in Myanmar and censored many users</seg>
<seg id="1287">The Burmese word "Kalar pae" means chickpeas or spigold.</seg>
<seg id="1288">Photo of Sanjay Acharya, Wikipedia Commons, Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 3.0 Unported</seg>
<seg id="1289">According to information from Facebook users in Myanmar, the well-known social network took their posts from the network because they contained the word 'Kalar'.</seg>
<seg id="1290">Although the origin of the word is still discussed, it is usually used to refer to people of East Indian origin or generally used as adjective "Indian."</seg>
<seg id="1291">Facebook censuses the word "Kalar" or "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "in Burma" "" "" "" "as part of an initiative to address the widespread problem of hate speech in Burma in the social network." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1292">In recent years, the rise of radical nationalist movements has given the word an extremely depreciating connotation.</seg>
<seg id="1293">In particular, it is a word that is mostly used by ultra-nationalists as hate speech against Muslims representing a minority of the population in Myanmar.</seg>
<seg id="1294">But in an effort to combat hate speech in Myanmar, the company has censored a lot of meaningful content on its platform.</seg>
<seg id="1295">'Kalar 'may normally be associated with racism, but the word itself does not automatically evoke hate speech.</seg>
<seg id="1296">The context is important & # 8212; many people have reported that posts where they have discussed the use of the word have been censored for its use.</seg>
<seg id="1297">In addition, there are several Burmese words with basic meanings that have the same sequence as' Kalar '.</seg>
<seg id="1298">For example, it is written on Burmese also called 'Kalar htaing', which contains the same letters as well as other words like 'Kalar pae', 'Kalar OAT' (camel) or 'kalenaar' (curtain).</seg>
<seg id="1299">The Facebooknutzer Aung Kaung Myat explained the different meanings of words with the sound of 'Kalar' so:</seg>
<seg id="1300">A post from one of my friends was deleted today because he contained the word Kalar.</seg>
<seg id="1301">However, he asked his friends in a witty way if they knew how to ease his back pain by making a play of words.</seg>
<seg id="1302">The sentence ku la - "healing" (ku) + the question word (la) on Burmese - resembles the racist expression, but the context is completely different.</seg>
<seg id="1303">There were various reactions to the Facebook initiative.</seg>
<seg id="1304">Zin Win Htet believes that it will reduce hate speech radical nationalists, but also stressed that Facebook must be more analytic before releasing all the posts that were suspected of spreading racism.</seg>
<seg id="1305">Facebook does not delete the word "Kalar" manually.</seg>
<seg id="1306">It filters the word automatically.</seg>
<seg id="1307">Automatism will not understand what you are writing to Faceook.</seg>
<seg id="1308">What you should do instead is to carefully analyze the post and check it by checking the following words.</seg>
<seg id="1309">For example, "Kalar Htine" (chair) and "Kalar pae" (splitting balls).</seg>
<seg id="1310">The good thing is that these dirty nationalists who spread hate speech receive a fairly good lesson.</seg>
<seg id="1311">Now it is time to circumcise their nationalism.</seg>
<seg id="1312">While the action may send a strong signal to anyone who is spreading hate speech, the efficiency of this strategy may not last long.</seg>
<seg id="1313">The experiences of social networks in China such as Sina Weibo and WeChat proved that the censorship of keywords is often a cat and mouse game, whereby the users of social networks can simply start using a new word or alternative spelling of the censored word to express their views.</seg>
<seg id="1314">The author Aung Kaung Myat described how Facebook started to delete his posts when he wanted to tell his friends that the word 'Kalar' is banished from the social network:</seg>
<seg id="1315">... when I became aware of this new Facebook policy, I made a post to tell my Facebook friends that the word is locked.</seg>
<seg id="1316">Ironically, my post was removed from Facebook and I was not allowed to use the Liken, post, and share content for 24 hours because the mail "did not meet the Facebook community standards."</seg>
<seg id="1317">Facebook has removed a multitude of posts from people who have no negative intentions or who simply try to show their opinions against the hate speech of radical nationalists.</seg>
<seg id="1318">Patrick Murphy wrote that his post was removed, which has nothing to do with hate speech:</seg>
<seg id="1319">Post without hate speech from Facebook.</seg>
<seg id="1320">In the post, the author expressed his opinion on why extreme nationalism and religious fundamentalism in the country are bad.</seg>
<seg id="1321">Chan Myae Khine believes Facebook should have done more before the start of the initiative, for example the Burmese Internet community to ask for advice:</seg>
<seg id="1322">Facebook likes to have a benevolent intention to reduce racism in Burma through its platform, but it does not work.</seg>
<seg id="1323">Censoring such words will only bring more hatred within the various communities.</seg>
<seg id="1324">In addition, it seems as if they have started this without local context or technical support and have forbidden such words as "stool" or "pea curry."</seg>
<seg id="1325">Even when they found out that they made mistakes, they did not try to correct the falsely deleted posts.</seg>
<seg id="1326">If they had just a little more respect for the 15 million benefits that would give them a big turnover, that would be great.</seg>
<seg id="1327">Facebooks automatic censorship has caused a lot of ridicule among users.</seg>
<seg id="1328">Instead of taking it seriously, users now make fun of Facebook and consciously write the word 'Kalar' in the context of hate speech to see if their posts are taken from the network.</seg>
<seg id="1329">Here you can see some screenshots of Facebook posts containing no hate speech, but still removed:</seg>

<seg id="1336">Over the past five years, extreme nationalist ideologies and religious fundamentalists have used social networks to expand their voices and influence.</seg>
<seg id="1337">Among other things, hate speech in social networks should also heat the violence in the communities in Myanmar, especially in the area of Rakhine where disputes between Muslims and Buddhists forced thousands to flee.</seg>
<seg id="1338">Facebook was criticized for his failure to bring out the exhilarating hate speech on his Burmese pages.</seg>
<seg id="1339">But instead of simply censoring the word 'Kalar', it would have been better to look at the context than on code concentrating initiatives and learned from them.</seg>

<seg id="1343">The children's marriage is now illegal in Trinidad and Tobago.</seg>
<seg id="1344">On 9 June 2017, the parliament of the country unanimously approved a law banning this practice, so that the homiciable age is now at 18.</seg>
<seg id="1345">Before this change of the marriage network, some members of Hindu and Muslim religious communities stuck to practice, and in May 2016 there was a large public scream. at that time, Brother Harrypersad Maharaj, a group of representatives of the various religious groups of the country, said that the state should not interfere since that, age does not determine maturity. "</seg>
<seg id="1346">Despite the fact that Trinidad and Tobago is a contractual partner of the UN Convention on Children's Rights, the minors are defined as "every man under 18 years of age."</seg>
<seg id="1347">UN statistics for the years 2002-2012 show that the proportion of children who were married to 15 was 2.8 percent in Trinidad and Tobago, and with 18 it was 8.1 percent.</seg>
<seg id="1348">In 2011, the Federal Statistical Office of the country confirmed that more than 8400 girls and 1300 boys were married at 19 in 1997-2007.</seg>
<seg id="1349">Online petitions and social media movements seeking to abolish laws on infancy, followed at the foot and enjoyed great support. undoubtedly, they helped bring about this result.</seg>
<seg id="1350">Nevertheless, not everything went smoothly.</seg>
<seg id="1351">A Hindu leader, for example, had no hesitation to tell the critics of the children's marriage, they should, condemning themselves to take care of their own affairs. "</seg>
<seg id="1352">This kind of religious opposition caused tensions in this really uncomplicated matter, and at some point there were doubts as to whether the opposition would agree to the draft bill.</seg>
<seg id="1353">But at the beginning of 2017, the bill was decided against the children's marriage - despite the four senators (among them a woman) of the opposition and an independent one, so that he could be discussed in the House of Representatives, where a simple majority would already make him a law.</seg>
<seg id="1354">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "now only the president of the country must agree and proclaim the law." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1355">One of the Senators of the country gave a status update on Facebook, which Leslie-Ann Boiselle reposted on Instagram:</seg>
<seg id="1356">Mr. Senator Clarence Rambharat: the bill against the children's marriage was voted in the House of Representatives with 35 votes and not one against it.</seg>
<seg id="1357">After having previously decided in the Senate, the draft can now become a law.</seg>
<seg id="1358">The majority of social media users were thrilled, because the laws on infancy had finally been changed.</seg>
<seg id="1359">Lovell Francis, a Facebook member of the Ministry of Education, said:</seg>
<seg id="1360">It took too much time and unnecessary talk that disguised the heart of the matter, but do you know what? the infancy is now illegal in Trinidad and Tobago, and that's worth almost any price.</seg>
<seg id="1361">While Abel Jackson was of the opinion, it definitely took long enough to abolish the practice, Lara Quentrall-Thomas was overjoyed that the day had finally arrived:</seg>
<seg id="1362">Public status update on Facebook by Lara Quentrali - Thomas, which states: ', Excellent news!</seg>
<seg id="1363">The network has been decided.</seg>
<seg id="1364">Minimum age - 18, voices - 35 for it - 0 against it!!!! "</seg>
<seg id="1365">Folade Mutota, which belongs to the Women's Institute for Alternative Development (WINAD), is a civil society group that talks quite openly about how important the adoption of the law was:</seg>
<seg id="1366">The age of marriage in Trinidad and Tobago is now independent of the religious affiliation of 18 years.</seg>
<seg id="1367">The amendment of the marriage network was decided today, on June 9, 2017.</seg>
<seg id="1368">There are 41 deputies in the House of Representatives and 35 of them were present at the vote.</seg>
<seg id="1369">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "all members who were admitted have voted for the law." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1370">The children's marriage in Trinidad and Tobago is no longer permitted by law.</seg>
<seg id="1371">It was a long battle (...) # turbioshildabuse.</seg>
<seg id="1372">Many thanks to all activists who challenged him.</seg>
<seg id="1373">Congratulations.</seg>
<seg id="1374">A thank you to our MEPs.</seg>
<seg id="1375">However, a possible catch comes in the form of Sat Maharaj, the Secretary General of Sanatan Dharma Maha Sabha, the most well-known Hindu organization of the country.</seg>
<seg id="1376">Months ago Maharaj has announced his intention to take judicial steps, the law should be passed, and he seems to redeem his promise.</seg>
<seg id="1377">While the Attorney General Paris Al rawi, a proponent of the law, said that it was quite legitimate if Maharaj wanted to go against the law, most social media users wished to address the debate on the subject differently.</seg>
<seg id="1378">Patricia Worrell proposed:</seg>
<seg id="1379">Dear Sat, if we, instead of discussing the discussion as general, in a way that can only cause panic and disgrace, if we say that the state, our daughters guard against it, that it might be abused by large, hard-boiled men who are in favor of them, "would you then be prepared to continue the discussion?</seg>
<seg id="1380">Or do you think it's not a problem?</seg>
<seg id="1381">However, whether it comes to a legal action against the law or not, this legislation is an important step - however, there are still places in the world where children are legally or still the norm in different grades, even though there are laws that prohibit them.</seg>
<seg id="1382">Hacker cranes the office of the prosecutor against national protests at the Russian national holiday</seg>

<seg id="1384">On the eve of national demonstrations against corruption that coincided with Russia's Day - the Russian National Day - the website of the prosecutor was hacked by the district of Yaroslavl. hackers left a funny message "Stay home.</seg>
<seg id="1385">"" "" "" "or we're bringing you to the jail instead of Dimon." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1386">The hackers posted the YouTube video "He is not a Dimon for you" on the Prosecutor's website with the following comment: "the Office of the Prosecutor calls the citizens not to follow the provocation and keep away from all non-sanctioned events!"</seg>
<seg id="1387">At 11.15 the message was removed from the page - but it remained in the cache.</seg>
<seg id="1388">It is # spared</seg>
<seg id="1389">On Sunday, the Office of the Prosecutor announced the local news service Yarnews that they were hacked.</seg>
<seg id="1390">By mirroring websites, Turkish users can view Wikipedia content again</seg>
<seg id="1391">The Wikipedia page was published on January 18, 2012, contrary to the SOPA (Stop Online Privacy Act) and PIPA copyright legislation in the United States, internationally darkened.</seg>
<seg id="1392">Created by Wikipedia (CC BY-SA 3.0)</seg>
<seg id="1393">Turkey has been blocking the popular and crowdsourcing principle based encyclopedia Wikipedia for over a month.</seg>
<seg id="1394">Day after day it becomes clear how important the platform is for users to find and share useful and reliable information.</seg>
<seg id="1395">Both students and reporters and fans of TV series defend themselves against the blocking.</seg>
<seg id="1396">Although many tech-savvy Internet users are used to using forming tools for blocked websites (a recent article by the New York Times reports that Turkey has the third largest VPN prevalence in the world), most common Wikipedia users do not fall into this category.</seg>
<seg id="1397">Although Turkey has blocked articles from Wikipedia, as recently published in a published report by the Berkman Klein Center for Internet & amp; Society at Harvard University, regular blockings of the Internet have been held since 2007 after the internet law (No. 5651) was adopted.</seg>
<seg id="1398">After China, Turkey is the second most famous country in the world when it comes to the massive censorship of Wikipedia.</seg>
<seg id="1399">While the platform continues to remain locked, several mirrors (pages that mirror the content of Wikipedia and are frequently updated) are now dipped.</seg>
<seg id="1400">A solution came from IPFS (the InterPlanetary File System), when the platform placed all Turkish Wikipedia pages on its decentralized peer-to-peer network (i.e. computer calculators), which does not rely on the system of domain names and thus makes a complete censorship difficult.</seg>
<seg id="1401">However, the content is available in spite of legal prohibition.</seg>
<seg id="1402">In a blog post, IPFS reports about his efforts:</seg>
<seg id="1403">After we've heard the news (about the block from Wikipedia), we put everything in place to take snapshots from Wikipedia on the IPFS platform. thus, it is possible to read the contents in a decentralized and distributed manner.</seg>
<seg id="1404">This can help users view at least all Wikipedia content even if they cannot reach the website www.wikipedia.org.</seg>
<seg id="1405">IPFS also stated that this step was done independently of the Wikimedia Foundation, and it is only screenshots and no live or dynamic versions of the website.</seg>
<seg id="1406">However, Wikimedia was involved in other efforts to circumvent the lock.</seg>
<seg id="1407">Cristian Consonni from Wikimedia Italy has both tr.vikiansiklopedi.org, a Mirrorpage from Wikipedia, as well as WikiMirror, an open source project that everyone can use to host similar mirrors when locked in the respective country Wikipedia.</seg>
<seg id="1408">Consonni reported Subhashish Panigrahi - Global Voices member and staff at Mozilla in the Panigrahi's Open Speaks "podcast:</seg>
<seg id="1409">It is not a complete copy of a proxy address, a mirror.</seg>
<seg id="1410">You access another URL that is not the original. that what you see is from Wikipedia.</seg>
<seg id="1411">Essentially, the server runs the request to the right Wikipedia page, so it is possible to see the contents of Wikipedia yourself when they are locked in Turkey.</seg>
<seg id="1412">This is done by a server that is not in Turkey.</seg>

<seg id="1415">Photo by Sagar Giri.</seg>
<seg id="1416">Used with permission.</seg>
<seg id="1417">Sagar Giri was never satisfied with the photos he saw around him. they were blurry with poorly positioned motives and washed colours.</seg>
<seg id="1418">This motivated him to take a camera and try to straighten the situation.</seg>
<seg id="1419">At that time he was still a child.</seg>
<seg id="1420">Today, at the age of 28, Sagar tries to bring Neptune to the international stage.</seg>
<seg id="1421">And his hometown, right next to Chitwan National Park, offers him the perfect opportunity to take photographs that draw attention to Neptune's wildlife.</seg>
<seg id="1422">He described on Facebook how this first-class location helps him in his work:</seg>
<seg id="1423">I live at the edge of Chitwan National Park, a world natural heritage. what could be better for a passionate wildlife photographer!!</seg>
<seg id="1424">I rested just at home when I suddenly called myself Navaraj (the manager of Chitwan Gaida Lodge). he had received a call from my father that a leopard would be leopard on the banks of the Rapti river.</seg>
<seg id="1425">The river is only a few minutes away from the tourist town of Sauraha.</seg>
<seg id="1426">Immediately I ran off with my camera and was there in a few minutes.</seg>
<seg id="1427">My father watched him and showed me the place on the other side of the river, where the leopard was located and I immediately started to gnash pictures!!</seg>
<seg id="1428">Sagar seeks cooperation with the authorities to obtain global recognition for Nepal and wants to deepen the understanding that wild animals are not as frightening as they look like.</seg>
<seg id="1429">And he should know [it], for he stood before Tigers face to face,</seg>
<seg id="1430">A tiger is not disturbed by the opinion of the sheep during sleep!!</seg>
<seg id="1431">Late in the evening. the light is too weak.</seg>
<seg id="1432">Sleeping time for all animals and birds.</seg>
<seg id="1433">Also I was on the way home because of the darkness, when the king of the boy suddenly appeared. he sat down immediately, we look at him and he stares me through the scarf-trees!!</seg>
<seg id="1434">To promote the protection of wild animals Sagar places the logo "I click for saffron" (lit.: I click for protection of the environment) on his photos.</seg>
<seg id="1435">His passion for the promotion of Nepalese nature and wildlife is not always easy.</seg>
<seg id="1436">He waited for 22 days and mostly lived in a tent to take pictures of Ottern in the Bardia National Park. up to 12 days it took until he could photograph a tiger and six to seven days for the perfect photo of birds living near the tourist accommodation.</seg>

<seg id="1469">This entry was written by Kayonaaz Kalyanwala and was originally published on video volunteers, an award-winning international community media organization from India.</seg>
<seg id="1470">A revised version has been republished here as part of a content sharing agreement.</seg>
<seg id="1471">In many parts of India, women with the greatest care should avoid the names of their husbands or even older men in the family.</seg>
<seg id="1472">Instead they use a pronouns or say "father of my child."</seg>
<seg id="1473">From Chhattisgarh to Maharashtra and Uttar Pradesh women admit that they respect husband because of social pressure, as well as fear of the consequences, they should despise the norm, keep this practice alive.</seg>
<seg id="1474">Last year, Malati Mahatoto was convicted of the Indian State of Odisha by a fake court and rejected by her family and the village community after having addressed a married couple with names.</seg>
<seg id="1475">The tradition of naming their wives as well is also common among men. however, they have far fewer grants to fear, if at all, they should not follow this practice.</seg>
<seg id="1476">In the small village of Walhe in Pune, in Maharashtra, nine women, including health personnel and housewives, joined a unique club and became the main topic of discussion in the city.</seg>
<seg id="1477">It is a place only for them to discuss and discuss the intricacies of the patriarchy.</seg>
<seg id="1478">As one of the 56 clubs that exist in 13 Indian states, it is part of the campaign # KhelBadal that is operated by the Community of Video Volunteers and advocates the dismantling of the Patriarchate.</seg>
<seg id="1479">Rohini Pawas has been working for seven years with the help of her video camera to detect practices such as child marriage, exile of HIV and AIDS-infected individuals, and manages these clubs.</seg>
<seg id="1480">It reports how these clubs created a safe place for these women and at the same time made them ambassadors of change.</seg>
<seg id="1481">The first video that Rohini showed in her discussion group was of women who did not call her husbands by name.</seg>
<seg id="1482">She chose this topic because she wanted to open up the discussion about the patriarchy with a problem with which the women can easily identify.</seg>
<seg id="1483">Not to speak loudly to the name of their husbands is a custom that they all have dutifully upheld and never questioned.</seg>
<seg id="1484">Rohini means:</seg>
<seg id="1485">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "this tradition testifies that a woman respects her husband and wishes him a long life." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1486">A woman who does not consider this will be considered deceitful as a woman without morality.</seg>
<seg id="1487">The tradition is so deeply rooted that we have never thought about it until this discussion round.</seg>
<seg id="1488">At the beginning, Rohini, who had never called her husband so far, wanted to try at home, as it is.</seg>
<seg id="1489">She showed the video of the discussion round her husband and her mother-in-law.</seg>
<seg id="1490">Rohini narrates:</seg>
<seg id="1491">My mother-in-law and my husband remained silent for a long time after the video ended.</seg>
<seg id="1492">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "Prakash, my husband, turned to me and said I should call him from now on his name." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1493">With this self-confidence in luggage, Rohini started her first discussion club.</seg>
<seg id="1494">Many women had never heard the word "patriarchy" before. some believed that it was a good thing because it meant that the younger members of a family, especially girls and women, were protected.</seg>
<seg id="1495">At the beginning of the round, Rohini showed a video about the problem in Uttar Pradesh.</seg>
<seg id="1496">After the video projection, the women tried to get the discussion underway.</seg>
<seg id="1497">Rohini invited every participant to say the name of her husband with different feelings - happy, angry, sad, loving and so on.</seg>
<seg id="1498">"" "" "" "then she asked all," "" "" "" "If we can't say the name of our husbands, but they can call us as they want, does that mean they don't respect us?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1499">"" "" "" "should it not be equivalent?" "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1500">"some of these women have been married for 30 years and this was the first day they brought the name of their husbands over their lips," says Rohini Paine from the village of Walhe in Maharashtra on the crushing of a centuries-old tradition in which married women could never speak the name of their husbands.</seg>
<seg id="1501">Rohini narrates:</seg>
<seg id="1502">A woman was so shy that she was hiding only in front of herself during the whole exercise; another decided to release the whole of his frustration against him and his family by cursing him.</seg>
<seg id="1503">The expression on their faces was ecstatic.</seg>
<seg id="1504">I think I'll never forget it again.</seg>
<seg id="1505">Still in the rush of adrenaline, having broken with an ancient custom, the women decided they would actually try to name their husbands by name.</seg>
<seg id="1506">And they kept their word.</seg>
<seg id="1507">In the next few days Rohini received a variety of reports.</seg>
<seg id="1508">The husband of a woman called Rohini and asked what ideas she put into the head of women: his wife could not stop telling his name.</seg>
<seg id="1509">Another club member decided to do it at dinner before the whole family.</seg>
<seg id="1510">When her mother-in-law stared her, she was afraid and said it was a mistake.</seg>
<seg id="1511">"" "" "" "another woman said:" "" "" "" "Rohini said I should do it." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1512">A member of a participant was less understanding and the situation was in force.</seg>
<seg id="1513">Rohini reports how women have tried to stop other practices, such as wearing the zinnoberred dot on the forehead that indicates the marital status:</seg>
<seg id="1514">Why do women only have to show that they are married?</seg>
<seg id="1515">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "I said to my husband that I would wear the zinc red dot if he did." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1516">He only laughed and I stopped wearing him.</seg>
<seg id="1517">The other women have not completely stopped doing so, but they think they are now in a better position to choose not to wear it on some days.</seg>
<seg id="1518">For many women, the discus club is a safe place where they can exchange their opinions and objectives.</seg>
<seg id="1519">"at each discussion club we make an excursion.</seg>
<seg id="1520">Normally we pack lunch and water and go out into the field.</seg>
<seg id="1521">"" "" "" "I don't want women to make sure who could hear what could hear," "" "" "" "she says." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1522">For the first time in the last months they celebrated their own birthdays in their life with cakes; they danced and sang and talked about things they had never thought before.</seg>
<seg id="1523">Rohini says:</seg>
<seg id="1524">I have been working on these problems for so many years and yet I have never been so honest about some things, for example how our identities are linked to our husbands.</seg>
<seg id="1525">It feels great to say certain things loud, no matter how small they occur.</seg>
<seg id="1526">In a discussion round, we talked about the concept of honor and how it is associated with clothes.</seg>
<seg id="1527">Some women in the group have only carried saris since their marriage.</seg>
<seg id="1528">For most of them this is okay, but some wanted to wear a Salman-Kurta, a wide shirt over a pants, they have not dared.</seg>
<seg id="1529">After a lot of arguments and discussion about the advantages of their own choice of clothes, morality associated with the Saris and much more, Rohini smuggled her own couple of Kurtas (Oberhemden) into a discussion round so that the women could wear them.</seg>
<seg id="1530">Next, they decided to plan a trip to Goa, where they can wear jeans and Rohini is sure they'll manage it.</seg>
<seg id="1531">On the question of whether things have changed in the five months since their first discussion club, Rohini confirms that things are slowly getting rolling:</seg>
<seg id="1532">So far we have done only small steps.</seg>
<seg id="1533">Some women tried it a few times, but then stopped to tell her husband's name.</seg>
<seg id="1534">Some, including myself, do it, but only if they are alone and no other family members are there.</seg>
<seg id="1535">Only one or two women continue to say the name of their husbands; only one or two women now wear Zinnoberrot on their foreheads at any time.</seg>
<seg id="1536">The women in the discussion club know that the changes they want to achieve in their lives - like haggling for more freedom of movement or their own choice - at the end of a difficult to navigate river.</seg>
<seg id="1537">By giving each other self-confidence, they become aware that they are sitting in the same boat.</seg>
<seg id="1538">How Rohini explains:</seg>
<seg id="1539">Each of us is a victim of the patriarchy.</seg>
<seg id="1540">I am also.</seg>
<seg id="1541">But this club gives each of us the confidence that something will change.</seg>
<seg id="1542">And I know that it is not limited to 30 families. there will be a chain reaction when every woman walks home in the club and tells other people about what we are talking about and what we are doing.</seg>
<seg id="1543">We all sit in the same boat.</seg>

<seg id="1549">On June 29, this year, the Hashtag was to be found in the Japanese Twitter trend, with which many fans exchanged memories and shared their appreciation for the Beatles.</seg>
<seg id="1550">The visit of the Beatles in 1966 in Japan is regarded as a turning point in the Japanese culture of the post-war era.</seg>
<seg id="1551">The first Japanese journalist, Hoshika Rumiko, who exclusively interviewed the Beatles 1964 in London, noted in 2016 on the occasion of the 50th anniversary of the first visit:</seg>
<seg id="1552">For just barely five days, the Beatles were in the country, but this was enough to let the Japanese go through.</seg>
<seg id="1553">The people here have become quite quickly clear that they had no choice but to receive the Beatles with open arms.</seg>
<seg id="1554">Many famous Japanese sizes had reached their zenith when the Beatles came to Japan for the first time in 1966.</seg>
<seg id="1555">The music of the cult band is "more than just a universal language like English," Ryuichi Isaka, President of the retailer Seven & amp; i Holdings, the online magazine Nikkei Asian Review.</seg>
<seg id="1556">Good morning! - Today the Beatles Memorial Day is in Japan. for the last 51 years it was here in Tokyo.</seg>
<seg id="1557">Also today songs from the Beatles are sung in Japanese karaoke bars and in English classes at Japanese middle schools.</seg>
<seg id="1558">The kitsch of the Beatles survives everything.</seg>
<seg id="1559">Today is Beatles Memorial Day.</seg>
<seg id="1560">We all love Beatles in our house.</seg>
<seg id="1561">I don't know if this "Winnie the Pooh" doll John Lennon is supposed to be or not.</seg>
<seg id="1562">And as it is for fans, Japanese of course also make pilgrimages to the well-known places connected with the band.</seg>
<seg id="1563">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "if you love the Beatles, these are your 5 places that you absolutely need to visit." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1564">1) Abbey Road</seg>
<seg id="1565">2) Matthew Street (in Liverpool)</seg>
<seg id="1566">3) Strawberry Fields (Memorial in New York)</seg>
<seg id="1567">4) Penny Lane</seg>
<seg id="1568">5) (From the link) The Beatles Story (Museum), Liverpool</seg>
<seg id="1569">The pilgrimages can sometimes not be quirky enough:</seg>
<seg id="1570">Good morning together.</seg>
<seg id="1571">Today is Beatles Memorial Day.</seg>
<seg id="1572">Exactly in 1966, the Beatles came to Japan for the first time.</seg>
<seg id="1573">The characters from the movie K-On! went on a pilgrimage to London and walked over Abbey Road.</seg>
<seg id="1574">We did the same last year too.</seg>
<seg id="1575">And of course, some companies also use the fanbase in terms of market terms, such as this Ramen shop (Ramen are Japanese noodles) in Tokyo.</seg>

<seg id="1585">A new system of kidnapping of bald people for organ trafficking, presumably for disbelieving purposes, dissolves the police of Zambézia, a province in Mozambique. the local government now called for a number of operations to stop the practice.</seg>
<seg id="1586">At the beginning of the month, three men were killed in the district of Milk, a few kilometers from the border to Malawi.</seg>
<seg id="1587">One of the victims was found decapitated and a part of the organs were taken.</seg>
<seg id="1588">Two men were arrested and subsequently they confessed that the organs of shamans were used in Tanzania and Malawi.</seg>
<seg id="1589">There is the local superstition that the head of a bald man could contain gold or bring wealth, said the police spokesman of Zambézia of the BBC.</seg>
<seg id="1590">It is the first time that successive attacks on bald men were registered in Mozambique.</seg>
<seg id="1591">Another group, the goal of murders for obscure purposes, are people with Albinism.</seg>
<seg id="1592">This meant that the UN 2016 in the South African country led a mission to investigate this practice.</seg>
<seg id="1593">The persecution of people with Albinism is common in other countries of southern Africa, especially in neighbouring Tanzania, where the government developed campaigns to fight these superstitions and prejudices.</seg>
<seg id="1594">Ukombe Weya lives in the city of Maputo.</seg>
<seg id="1595">He warned those who intend to travel to the country:</seg>
<seg id="1596">Attention to bald men who travel to Mozambique are the target of ritualistic attacks, the Mozambican police warned of the latest killings of three bald men because of their body parts.</seg>
<seg id="1597">Two suspects were arrested in the district of Milange, where the killings took place.</seg>
<seg id="1598">Hussene Algy Adamo, student and resident of the city of Inhambane in the south of Mozambique, said that the local police had already followed the case:</seg>
<seg id="1599">PRM believes that the shamans are involved in the death of the bald men.</seg>
<seg id="1600">The persecution and murder of bald individuals for the extraction and sale of their organs in the district of Morrumba, province of Zambézia, has been commissioned by the traditional shamans, which also attracts the police of the Republic of Mozambique, which also indicates that a faith existed, according to which the victims in the head might have power to generate the riches.</seg>
<seg id="1601">In recent days, three men with hair loss problems have been murdered in this part of the country.</seg>
<seg id="1602">On Facebook Angela Ferreira Samantha shared the chronicle of the Bloggers poor Snaippa, who suggested that the problem is part of the greater social difficulty facing Mozambique:</seg>
<seg id="1603">I MÖCHTE GERNE EIN Mozambique, THE SME is ashamed of a country in which people would be ashamed to ask for good grades, work and other services, a nation in which people would not hurt or even take their lives to earn their bread, a country in which neither the Albinos nor bald or bald-headed for superfidel purposes or "black magic."</seg>
<seg id="1604">Despite the seriousness of the phenomenon, some missed the opportunity for macabre humour.</seg>
<seg id="1605">Zenaida Machado, scientist of Human Rights Watch for Angola and Mozambique and enthusiastic twitter user, tweetete that both the chief of the district Morrumba, Pedro Sange and the police officer Zambézias, Inácio Dina, are both smooth-headed:</seg>
<seg id="1606">Mozambican authorities are very concerned about the murders of bald people.</seg>

<seg id="1626">A photo by Liu Xiaobo and Liu Xia, probably made just recently.</seg>
<seg id="1627">This story was originally published on 8 July 2017 in Hong Kong Free Press.</seg>
<seg id="1628">The following version will be published as part of a partnership agreement via Global Voices.</seg>
<seg id="1629">The case of the imprisoned Chinese dissident Liu Xiaobo has attracted attention in the international community after his lawyer announced at the end of June that he was hospitalized for liver cancer in the final stage.</seg>
<seg id="1630">In 2009, Liu was sentenced to eleven years in prison for "Subversion" (state threat), having participated in the draft Charter 08, a manifesto demanding democratic reforms in China.</seg>
<seg id="1631">He was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for his work in 2010.</seg>
<seg id="1632">The Ministry of Foreign Affairs in China has called Liu's case as "an internal affair" and narrates a spokesperson, he considered it "not necessary to discuss this matter with any other country."</seg>
<seg id="1633">Nevertheless, China continues to receive calls from the international community, Nobel laureates and his wife, denser Liu Xia, to release him or to allow him treatment abroad.</seg>
<seg id="1634">While some countries criticized the strict treatment of the couple in Beijing, other countries are completely wiped out.</seg>
<seg id="1635">Hong Kong Free Press has summarised some reactions from abroad.</seg>
<seg id="1636">United Nations: United Nations</seg>
<seg id="1637">Zeid Ra-ad al-Hussein, the High Commissioner of the United Nations for Human Rights, met Chinese officials at the end of June in order to discuss the case of Liu.</seg>
<seg id="1638">However, a spokesman refused to comment on whether the United Nations should exercise pressure to permit treatment abroad.</seg>
<seg id="1639">Norway. Norway</seg>
<seg id="1640">Norway's Prime Minister Erna Solberg and Foreign Minister Børge Brende refused to answer questions about Liu's release.</seg>
<seg id="1641">The relationship between China and Norway was stalled after the Nobel Peace Prize in 2010 was awarded to Liu, although the Norwegian government announced that it was ultimately nothing to do with the decision.</seg>
<seg id="1642">Diplomatic relations were resumed only in December last year. only in June Norway signed an agreement to resume the Salmon exports to China, as exports have been largely blocked since 2010.</seg>
<seg id="1643">After the news spread that Liu was seriously ill, the Nobel Committee expressed his hope for unconditional release and invited Liu to pick up his prize in Oslo.</seg>
<seg id="1644">Because of his imprisonment, he was unable to accept his price.</seg>
<seg id="1645">During the ceremony Liu was represented by an empty chair.</seg>
<seg id="1646">The European Union</seg>
<seg id="1647">On 6 July, the European Parliament adopted a resolution calling on China to release Liu and his wife immediately from house arrest and allow him to seek medical support wherever he wants.</seg>
<seg id="1648">The top diplomat of the EU, Federica Mogherini, also called on China to release Lius, as stated in an explanation on June 30:</seg>
<seg id="1649">At the same time, we expect China to highlight all the restrictions of Mr. Liu's wife and family members.</seg>
<seg id="1650">They should meet and receive all the visits they wish, and be able to communicate freely with the outside world.</seg>

<seg id="1653">A spokesperson on the US Embassy in China, Mary Beth Polley, announced the news agency AFP on 27 June that the message afforded the Chinese authorities not only to release Liu, but also to liberate his wife Liu Xia from house arrest.</seg>
<seg id="1654">The request of the US Embassy drew a furious answer from China, with the utterance of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, that "no country has the right to interfere and make irresponsible remarks on Chinese internal affairs."</seg>
<seg id="1655">Polley said that China should offer the couple the following:</seg>
<seg id="1656">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "protection and freedom such as freedom of travel and access to medical care of his choice, to which they are entitled according to the Chinese constitution and legal system and international obligations." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1657">The U.S. Senators Marco Rubio, Jeff Merkley and Ted Cruz have also adopted a resolution in Congress to urge the Chinese government to unconditionally release Liu and his wife.</seg>

<seg id="1659">Germany: Germany</seg>
<seg id="1660">German government spokesman Steffen Seibert wrote on July 3, Berlin that Liu "receives all the medical support he needs," and that a "humanitarian solution for Liu Xiaobo should be the highest priority."</seg>
<seg id="1661">Chinese President Xi Jinping appeared on 7 and 8 July at the G20 summit in Hamburg.</seg>
<seg id="1662">Previously, diplomatic sources in Beijing were reported to the news agency Reuters that China had great concerns about whether the vortex around Liu could overshadow the visit to Hamburg.</seg>
<seg id="1663">Canada - Canada</seg>
<seg id="1664">On 28 June, Canadian Ambassador John McCallum urged China to provide Liu with adequate medical care and to give him the opportunity to take care of his family.</seg>
<seg id="1665">Liu's lawyer told AFP that Liu's wife, Liu Xia could visit him every day, but the police always monitored the room in the hospital and that Liu is not allowed to speak and contact with someone outside, including his lawyers.</seg>
<seg id="1666">McCallum further tells:</seg>
<seg id="1667">Canada urges China to uphold its international human rights obligations, including freedom of expression, and release the rights contained in the exercise of these rights.</seg>
<seg id="1668">France: France</seg>
<seg id="1669">France's foreign ministry urged China to release Liu on humanitarian grounds on 29 June:</seg>
<seg id="1670">All necessary measures must be taken to ensure that Liu Xiaobo gets all the treatments he needs, regardless of where required. furthermore, his wife and family should have contact with him.</seg>
<seg id="1671">Although the news channel France Info already reported that the French government would welcome Liu in the country, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs announced that there will be no further information whether France will ultimately receive it.</seg>
<seg id="1672">Taiwan - Taiwan</seg>
<seg id="1673">The Council of fixed land affairs in Taiwan invited China on 27 June to release Liu and show a greater tolerance towards those who employ peaceful means to demand political reforms and democratic development.</seg>
<seg id="1674">The Taiwanese legislator Yu-Mei-nu from the ruling Democratic Progressive Party also urged China to allow the sick intellectual Liu to be treated in Taiwan.</seg>
<seg id="1675">Dalai Lama</seg>
<seg id="1676">The spiritual leader in Tibet, the Dalai Lama, was very concerned in an explanation on 28 June around Liu and admitted that many asked him to pray for Liu's well-being.</seg>
<seg id="1677">He said about Liu:</seg>
<seg id="1678">It is my belief that the initiatives he took and for whom he was severely punished, would have led to a more harmonious, stable and prosperous China, which in turn would have contributed to a more peaceful world.</seg>
<seg id="1679">I personally felt very moved and encouraged when I saw hundreds of Chinese intellectuals and affected citizens, inspired by Liu Xiaobo, who signed Charter 08, which stands for democracy, freedom and rule of law in China.</seg>
<seg id="1680">Singapore: city or country?</seg>
<seg id="1681">Singapore.</seg>
<seg id="1682">License: CC0 Domaine Public</seg>
<seg id="1683">Is Singapore a city or a country?</seg>
<seg id="1684">The question may seem stupid, since Singapore is recognized as an independent state at an international level.</seg>
<seg id="1685">But according to the Minister of Justice, K. Shanmugam, Singapore should be considered a city.</seg>
<seg id="1686">This remark has triggered a debate in the blogosphere.</seg>
<seg id="1687">During the meeting on the occasion of a meeting of the international branch of the Bar Association of New York, the Minister noted that many people criticised the dominance of Singapore's only political party because they compared Singapore to other countries.</seg>
<seg id="1688">He supports Singapore to be considered a city.</seg>
<seg id="1689">... no one has questioned whether New York is a democracy...</seg>
<seg id="1690">That's it, most people commit a mistake.</seg>
<seg id="1691">I have tried to explain that we are different.</seg>
<seg id="1692">We are a city.</seg>
<seg id="1693">We are not a country.</seg>
<seg id="1694">The blog Cavalierio accused the Minister of Justice to "twist the logic" in order to defend the existing authoritarian exercise of power in Singapore.</seg>
<seg id="1695">And then, after all our efforts and sacrifices to create this precious land, one hears that we are ultimately not a country.</seg>
<seg id="1696">It sounded so vulgar, it had the appearance of an escape from the responsibilities, a breach of duty.</seg>
<seg id="1697">Singapore, if you are not my country, whose land is it then?</seg>
<seg id="1698">The reasons cited by Shanmugam were not very nobel: he defended an idea, according to which one could not measure the Singapore political system with other 'normal countries', considering that, he seemed invariably undemocratic.</seg>
<seg id="1699">On the other hand, he defended the idea that Singapore should be compared to cities such as Chicago, San Francisco or New York, equally cities that are permanently run by a party.</seg>
<seg id="1700">These cities are democratic.</seg>
<seg id="1701">As soon as one reaches the core of the subject, the good old lyre appears again from the authoritarian rulers who pretend to be democrats, leaving the distorted logic, since it is better suited to their power.</seg>
<seg id="1702">In the end, the answers to his American guests in the last week of Shanmugam were really non-answers concerning our press, our judiciary, our political system.</seg>
<seg id="1703">He answers corresponding questions with a non-answers rational manner.</seg>
<seg id="1704">Rachel Zeng calls on Shanmugam to clarify his opinion as she did not understand this conclusion.</seg>
<seg id="1705">Personally, I find it a bit difficult to swallow.</seg>
<seg id="1706">If Singapore is not a country, it is a city, so to which country belongs our city...</seg>
<seg id="1707">In short, I don't understand anything.</seg>
<seg id="1708">I would be very grateful if our dear K Shanmugam would take the trouble to clarify this point if he was highly paid to be part of the government of the city of Singapore.</seg>
<seg id="1709">By publishing his commentary on the blog, he points out that one should start reading the whole transcript of the conference in order to better understand the context of the statements of Shanmugam, according to which Singapore is a city and no country.</seg>
<seg id="1710">Read the transcript.</seg>
<seg id="1711">When he said that Singapore is more of a city than a country, "he explained why the Singapore elections are so unimportant even if we enjoy free and fair elections.</seg>
<seg id="1712">He compared Singapore with cities in the USA (and how many of these cities saw a party for decades?).</seg>
<seg id="1713">"" "" "" "when he said Singapore" "" "" "" "be not a country," "" "" "" "he obviously did not mean it in this sense!" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1714">Clement Tan shows his disappointment about Shanmugam, who as leader of a growing generation, makes such a polemical statement.</seg>
<seg id="1715">I am very embarrassed about what the Minister of Justice of Singapore said...</seg>
<seg id="1716">At least I knew with Lee Kuan Yew and the members of the old guard what I expected - whether I agree with them or not, but that's another thing.</seg>
<seg id="1717">But with K. Shanmugam, member of the new generation of the political leaders of Singapore, I have doubts and I'm not even sure if he really believes he is properly associated and aware of what he defends.</seg>
<seg id="1718">The TEMASEK review dismantles the weak points of Shanmugams's arguments:</seg>
<seg id="1719">Has Mr. Shanmugam "believed an error" or was it a Freudian spokesperson?</seg>
<seg id="1720">If Singapore is not a country, we are regarded only as an independent and sovereign state?</seg>
<seg id="1721">If not, to which country do the sovereign rights of the city of Singapore go back?</seg>
<seg id="1722">Singapore is unique, it is equally land and city.</seg>
<seg id="1723">Since it plays an important role within the government cabinet, the statements of Mr. Shanmugam are of serious importance.</seg>
<seg id="1724">Why do the people of Singapore do their military service, but do they defend their city only?</seg>
<seg id="1725">Who does our prime minister have to pay bills?</seg>
<seg id="1726">What is the value of our pink identity card?</seg>
<seg id="1727">Are we the citizens of a country or the inhabitants of a city?</seg>
<seg id="1728">The magazine Journey of a Decade adds to Bejahung, Singapore and has always been a city:</seg>
<seg id="1729">"I didn't say what I said..."</seg>
<seg id="1730">This sentence seems to have angered many people of Singapore...</seg>
<seg id="1731">Nobody ever said that Singapore is a country.</seg>
<seg id="1732">We were always a city.</seg>
<seg id="1733">We have always been a city / island state.</seg>
<seg id="1734">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "I can understand that we often hear statements like" "" "" "" "defense of the country especially" "" "" "", "but that is not quite correct." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1735">We should rather talk about the defence of the city.</seg>

<seg id="1740">Their answers are published here as part of a continuous series, with which rumors about certain parts of the world are revealed and another facet is to be shown.</seg>
<seg id="1741">The latest part of this series comes from Nevin Thompson, editor for Global Voices Japan, who lives in Canada and Japan.</seg>
<seg id="1742">The question I asked most in Japan is: "are you Americans?"</seg>
<seg id="1743">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "no, I am sorry," "" "" "" "I come from Canada." "" "" "" "I have been living in Japan since 1994." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1744">Depending on the situation in which the conversation takes place, it is considered polite to show interest in his conversation partner by asking personal questions.</seg>
<seg id="1745">On my clarification the standard answer follows: "Oh, Rocky Mountains, ice hockey, nature." many Canadians perhaps cook inwardly against anger when they are held for Americans, but it doesn't bother me.</seg>
<seg id="1746">For someone who doesn't know himself, there is little that makes us different from Canadians of Americans.</seg>
<seg id="1747">This is one of the reasons why so many Canadians make a Canadian flag clearly visible on their backpack when they travel.</seg>
<seg id="1748">Everyone loves Canadians.</seg>
<seg id="1749">Americans, on the other hand,....</seg>
<seg id="1750">So it was already when I began to travel through the world 20 years ago - before Donald Trump, before the invasion of Iraq and September 11.</seg>
<seg id="1751">Canadians have always carried small maple leaves on their baggage to distinguish themselves from their American neighbors.</seg>
<seg id="1752">We have a free health care!</seg>
<seg id="1753">There are no weapons with us!</seg>
<seg id="1754">Same-sex marriages have been legal in Canada since 2005!</seg>
<seg id="1755">Everyone seems to think, Canada is so great.</seg>
<seg id="1756">We are polite.</seg>
<seg id="1757">We obviously say very often "apologies."</seg>
<seg id="1758">Canada is said to be the most tolerant country on ethnic groups.</seg>
<seg id="1759">We are not as these types south of the border.</seg>
<seg id="1760">We Canadians are nice.</seg>
<seg id="1761">I hate that.</seg>
<seg id="1762">First, I have many American friends whom I admire very much.</seg>
<seg id="1763">It wouldn't matter to me if you'd be confused with Johnny from Dallas for example.</seg>
<seg id="1764">With Marc out of Austin.</seg>
<seg id="1765">With Adam from San Francisco.</seg>
<seg id="1766">Or with Michael from Honolulu.</seg>
<seg id="1767">There are also some problems with the stamp 'nice'.</seg>
<seg id="1768">First: being called "nice," means to be spelling - like benign, gentle but tragically insignificant figure Ned Flanders from "The Simpsons" (which has its own Canadian Doppelgänger).</seg>
<seg id="1769">If Canada is really a nation full of people like Ned Flanders, that would indeed be a step forward. but the real problem is that "nice" does not have personality.</seg>
<seg id="1770">There are no corners and edges, nothing that you can encounter.</seg>
<seg id="1771">Being harmless means to be unobtrusive and uninteresting and not to deserve attention.</seg>
<seg id="1772">This can be a good thing if you want to stay in the background unnoticed, away from things that happen around you.</seg>
<seg id="1773">I would even go to say that the desire to be free and alone is a major part of the Canadians.</seg>
<seg id="1774">We tend to take care of our own affairs.</seg>
<seg id="1775">What outsiders call "nice" is perhaps simply cool courtesy.</seg>
<seg id="1776">Canadians do not often talk over the fence with the neighbors.</seg>
<seg id="1777">We lack the warm, open friendliness that I now associate with my American friends.</seg>
<seg id="1778">Luckily for us (and for the rest of the world) Justin Trudeau is viewing the stage to show that Canadians are more than just "nice." our prime minister has made Canada virtually sexy.</seg>
<seg id="1779">Music video of a pop-band parodiaks Thailand's junta</seg>
<seg id="1780">A pop band famous in Thailand has released a music video that paranodes the Junta, which took power in 2014, and despite its promise to restore the civilian government, continues to rule the country.</seg>
<seg id="1781">The new song "Dictator Girl" (Phadet Girl) of the Band Tattoo Colour describes a young man who tells him what instructions his girlfriend makes.</seg>
<seg id="1782">Although not explicitly political, the music video relates indirectly to the continued military rule of the Junta.</seg>
<seg id="1783">The band was praised by many fans and other Internet users for their courage to describe the situation of the country.</seg>
<seg id="1784">The video for the song was a huge success.</seg>
<seg id="1785">On Facebook alone within the first three days, the video uploaded on Facebook was 1.254 times and received 8,800 votes.</seg>
<seg id="1786">Last month, even Charlie Chaplin video "The dictator" in Thailand was blocked after a group of activists appealed to the public to watch this video.</seg>
<seg id="1787">The video can be interpreted as a creative and entertaining introduction to Thai politics, particularly as it relates to the situation of the country under the junta rule.</seg>
<seg id="1788">Take a look at these videos from the videos that relate to some of the political themes that Thailand has persistently pursued in the past three years.</seg>
<seg id="1789">The "44 rules of the girls" may refer to the draconian section 44 of the preliminary constitution, which gives the commander-in-chief of the army absolute decision making over important national issues.</seg>
<seg id="1790">The 11th rule: "change your attitude" refers to the notorious program of "changing the settings" of journalists, students, scientists, activists, politicians and other persons who are considered critics of the Junta.</seg>
<seg id="1791">The picture above reflects the introduction of the law on computer crime, whose vague and unclear rules are often used by the authorities to arrest activists and other critics of the state.</seg>
<seg id="1792">For this purpose, a new unit has also been established in the army which monitors online content and persons accused of having slandered the monarchy to be prosecuted.</seg>
<seg id="1793">Thailand implements a strict plea against "Lese Majeste" (majesty).</seg>
<seg id="1794">On 20 May 2014 martial law was proclaimed in Thailand.</seg>
<seg id="1795">Two days later, a coup led by the army.</seg>
<seg id="1796">One of the problems that the Junta continues to pursue is their decision to buy expensive submarines, although security experts warned them that the purchase is unnecessary and a waste of taxpayers.</seg>
<seg id="1797">In the video, it is even shown how people are thrown into a black delivery van before bringing them into an internment camp, another problem.</seg>
<seg id="1798">Some journalists are in prison because they allegedly caused "confusion" in society and Internet users are threatened with long jail sentences, they should offend the monarchy.</seg>
<seg id="1799">Meanwhile, the teaser of the songs showed members of the band, who imitated the Salut from "The Tribute of Panem," which was already used by coup opponents during the protests in 2014.</seg>

<seg id="1805">Now more than 20 years have passed since the Georgian-Abchassic war has been officially terminated, but its scars are still visible in this part of the republic.</seg>
<seg id="1806">The abandoned villages of the northern district in Tkuarchal are showing striking images.</seg>
<seg id="1807">Villages like Dzhantukha, Akarmara, Pyataya Shakhta, Polyana and Kharchilava are located in the hydrocarbons of Abchasia.</seg>
<seg id="1808">Various ethnic groups such as Russians, Greeks, Eurasia, Georgians and Armenians lived and worked on Soviet sites in the area.</seg>
<seg id="1809">Many of them had to leave their homes during the war.</seg>
<seg id="1810">Today, most of the Russians and rabbits live in the area.</seg>
<seg id="1811">Such settlements are also called ghost cities in Abchasia.</seg>
<seg id="1812">In the pre-war period more than 10,000 people lived here, today only a few hundred people are in these ghost cities.</seg>
<seg id="1813">This phenomenon is characteristic of Tkuarchal.</seg>
<seg id="1814">Since 2011, the total population of the district was 16,000 people after having barely stepped up over a decade.</seg>
<seg id="1815">In 1989 about 43,000 people lived in this district.</seg>

<seg id="1819">The empty five-storey blocks of the Soviet Union from the early 1960s, called Khrushchukowkas, symbolize the decline and devastation of the region.</seg>
<seg id="1820">The buildings are falling and very rarely they are inhabited by more than two families.</seg>

<seg id="1828">Before the war the village was full of life.</seg>
<seg id="1829">There were community centers, schools and kindergartens, all of which served the community.</seg>
<seg id="1830">Now there is only paved road with faded glory buildings.</seg>
<seg id="1831">The people who once lived in this place and made their contribution to the central plan economy of the Soviet Union have meanwhile left the district.</seg>
<seg id="1832">In the ghost town of Dzhantukha, about fifty inhabitants live.</seg>
<seg id="1833">About 38 people live in Akarmara, in the other villages it looks similar.</seg>
<seg id="1834">The chryoshka, which still houses one or two families, can be seen at the balconies where laundry is dried.</seg>
<seg id="1835">Two young girls, both seven years old, look out of the window of a destroyed house.</seg>

<seg id="1839">The girl whispers something to her girlfriend and suddenly she leaves the destroyed building and disappears.</seg>
<seg id="1840">Many people in the area work for a small Turkish mining company called Tkuarchalugol.</seg>
<seg id="1841">Families are also involved in the subsistence economy (cultivating agricultural products for self-consumption) such as livestock, beekeeping and vegetable farming.</seg>
<seg id="1842">It is difficult to get over the rounds.</seg>
<seg id="1843">The district administration provides free candles and bread to the villages in winter.</seg>

<seg id="1849">Galina does not want to receive financial help from her daughter and insists she supports her young grandchildren instead.</seg>

<seg id="1898">On the way of migrants crossing Europe or Latin America, certain places are known for their hospitality.</seg>
<seg id="1899">I visited one of these places in the Mexican city of Tapachula, it is located on the border to Guatemala.</seg>
<seg id="1900">It is a very simple hotel near the city center.</seg>
<seg id="1901">It is led by a 59th year old Mexican woman, a small woman with a coral-pink frame and gold colored earrings in teddy bear shape.</seg>
<seg id="1902">She is called Concepción González Ramírez and was born in Tapachula and grew up there. nevertheless, they know many under the name of Mama Africa.</seg>
<seg id="1903">This nickname is due to the fact that the hotel (or rather it itself) has become a destination for Africans and Haitians who are on the transit.</seg>
<seg id="1904">The hotel has no charm.</seg>
<seg id="1905">For approximately 2.50 dollars the night the guests sleep in simple rooms, with bare, crumbling walls and beds made of metal.</seg>
<seg id="1906">In the anteroom there is a parrot in a cage.</seg>
<seg id="1907">There is no sign for the hotel - yet hundreds of African and Haitian migrants are coming here.</seg>
<seg id="1908">"" "" "" "sometimes, Ms Ramírez" "" "" "" "tells people in full minibuses and from the upper part of the coast they begin to cry:" "" "" "" "Mama Africa!" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1909">Where are you mom Africa?. "</seg>
<seg id="1910">At the moment it is rather quiet, but this year Ramírez has already received 200 guests at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="1911">There are only 24 rooms, some have already slept outside on cardboard.</seg>
<seg id="1912">She does not want to reject anybody.</seg>
<seg id="1913">She also helps them and brings them to the hospital when they are sick, she buys them drugs that they cannot pay, they massage them with a balm the feet exhausted by the long journey.</seg>
<seg id="1914">Tychque Sebastiao, originally from Angola, has arrived recently.</seg>
<seg id="1915">I asked him if Mum Africa was an appropriate nickname for Ms Ramírez.</seg>

<seg id="1920">Very loving.</seg>
<seg id="1921">She has the warmth of a mother...</seg>
<seg id="1922">We feel very comfortable here. "</seg>
<seg id="1923">Sebastiao is traveling with his sister who hopes to go to Boston to find her husband and the three children.</seg>
<seg id="1924">They have lived in Brazil, but it is for some Africans who are on their way to the United States to make a first stop in South America and then move northwards.</seg>
<seg id="1925">The family had heard from other companions of Mama Africa. "Mama Africa is a well-known name on the track," says Felix Michelet, a guest from Haiti.</seg>
<seg id="1926">He tells us that the Haitians and Africans often travel together and that Africans are already talking about Mrs Ramírez on Whatsapp.</seg>
<seg id="1927">Like many of his companions, Michelet lived in Brazil before and worked as a construction worker on the construction sites of the Olympic Games and the World Cup.</seg>
<seg id="1928">When the Brazilian economy became weaker, he started his trip to the United States.</seg>
<seg id="1929">He has been a guest at Mom Africa for months: he sells SIM cards to save the money needed to buy the bus ticket to Tijuana.</seg>
<seg id="1930">I ask him if he will have contact with Mrs. Ramírez in the future.</seg>
<seg id="1931">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "Mama Africa is our mother and we never let her go again," "" "" "" "he says smiling." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1932">Ms. Ramírez tells her that her guests often send text messages when they have gone to greet them or to tell her about the course of their journey.</seg>
<seg id="1933">She explains that her Christian faith is the drive of her work.</seg>
<seg id="1934">She doesn't know much about Africa, but her guests have taught her to cook chickens like in Ghana.</seg>
<seg id="1935">MS Ramírez is perhaps very well known here, but it is not the only spark of hope for the migrants who travel through Tapachula.</seg>
<seg id="1936">At the other end of the city leads a dead end to Jesús Valenzuela.</seg>
<seg id="1937">This winter, Valenzuela and his family have picked up migrants in their small house.</seg>
<seg id="1938">He is a policeman and has found that the bus tickets are sold to a large number of African immigrants.</seg>
<seg id="1939">He began to help them get a reasonable price, then he offered them his house for one dollar the night.</seg>
<seg id="1940">At the moment there are 25 people, mainly Haitians.</seg>
<seg id="1941">Some sleep on blankets on the floor, but at least they have electricity, a washing machine and a kitchenette outside.</seg>
<seg id="1942">Valenzuela declares that he knows what the guests are going through.</seg>
<seg id="1943">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "I lived in the United States," "" "" "" "he says." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1944">I crossed the border crossing the desert and we suffered.</seg>
<seg id="1945">"" "" "" "there are places where people help and others do not help. that's why I give them my support." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1946">After he lived for three years, he was expelled from the United States after a raid on his job site.</seg>
<seg id="1947">The majority of migrants traveling through Tapachula comes from Central America, other residents also open the doors of their homes for them.</seg>
<seg id="1948">José Antonio Cordova Meléndez tells me that he fled to Honduras with his wife and three children from people who wanted to blackmail him money without having a plan.</seg>
<seg id="1949">In Tapachula, he asked for an accommodation and an unknown, an all-one, offered him her roof.</seg>
<seg id="1950">A few months later, the family still lives there and tries to decide where the next steps should go.</seg>
<seg id="1951">Back in the house of Mama Africa everything is again full of guests.</seg>
<seg id="1952">In the corridors, travellers consult their telephones quietly.</seg>
<seg id="1953">A minibus arrived today and brought 20 new guests, most of them from Somalia.</seg>
<seg id="1954">Mrs. Ramírez seems happy that her house is full, but she is also nostalgic because of those who have gone away.</seg>
<seg id="1955">Like a proud grandmother, she leaves her album with numerous photos.</seg>
<seg id="1956">There is one of her daughter with African hair plaits she has made her an Kundin, some photos of her grandchildren and many travelers more, boy and old.</seg>
<seg id="1957">She laughs sadly, while she briefly presents her to me.</seg>
<seg id="1958">"Ya se fueron," repeats it every time. "they have already gone."</seg>
<seg id="1959">China: Xinjiang residents are forced to install a surveillance app on their mobile phones.</seg>
<seg id="1960">A check point for personal communication devices in Xinjang of twitter-user-based congestion.</seg>
<seg id="1961">The inhabitants of Xinjiang, an ethnic minority in western China, are forced to install a spyware on their mobile phones.</seg>
<seg id="1962">On 10 July, mobile users in the Tianshan District of Urumqi received a mobile notification in which they instruct the district government to install a surveillance app called Jingwang (or "Web Cleaning").</seg>
<seg id="1963">"" "" "" "in the message it is said that the app will prevent" "" "" "" "get access to terrorist information" "" "" "". "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1964">However, the authorities tried to use the app for more than fighting terrorism.</seg>
<seg id="1965">According to an exclusive report by Radio Free Asia, 10 Kazakh women were arrested in the autonomous Ili Kazakh prefecture, because they had sent messages with a private WeChat group shortly after they had installed the app.</seg>
<seg id="1966">The police reported that the app would investigate and track the sources and distribution channels of the terrorists along with "illegal religious" activities and "harmful information" including videos, images, eBooks and documents.</seg>
<seg id="1967">Jingwanger's website describes the app as follows:</seg>
<seg id="1968">Jingwang is a protection service with system categories for children and adults, introduced by Jiangsu Telecom.</seg>
<seg id="1969">The main feature is blocking pornographic websites, online fraud, trojans and phishing pages to alert users how much time they spend online and to remotely control their home network.</seg>
<seg id="1970">This app for minors is intended to help children develop a healthy lifestyle.</seg>
<seg id="1971">An app with these functions can of course be used in many ways.</seg>
<seg id="1972">For example, the "remote control" could enable state actors or even hackers to manipulate or steal a person's home network.</seg>
<seg id="1973">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "this introduction is in line with other measures to control the digital activities in this region." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1974">While notifications of digital censorship in China mostly focus on the experiences of users in larger cities in the East and the South, reality is very often gloomy for those living in remote, crowded ethnic minority regions such as Xinjiang and Tibet.</seg>
<seg id="1975">In order to limit unrest and discontent in conflict areas, the authorities often associate extreme censors and surveillance measures as well as routinely Internet shutdowns.</seg>
<seg id="1976">The Twitter-based media outlet "Images from mainland China" published censored news in China showed photos of a checkpoint where policemen checked the occupants randomly to see if they had installed the monitoring app.</seg>
<seg id="1977">The authorities in Xinjian make sure that people use the official Jingwang app.</seg>
<seg id="1978">A mobile notification demanded that people install the app within 10 days.</seg>
<seg id="1979">If you are detected at a checkpoint with a device without this software, they may be imprisoned for up to 10 days.</seg>
<seg id="1980">This is a setback for technological development.</seg>
<seg id="1981">You have forced people to use devices that are intended for older people.</seg>
<seg id="1982">This is a form of captivity by the rest technology.</seg>
<seg id="1983">We are back in Maos China.</seg>
<seg id="1984">A Jingwang product description also published a Jingwang product description indicating that the software can lift the password request of a Windows operating system and thus unrestricted access to the computer's hard drive.</seg>
<seg id="1985">After installing Jingwang, computers and mobile phones are turned into electronic handcuffs in Xinjiang.</seg>
<seg id="1986">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "the provisions in Jingwang may be a reaction to the statements of the City Party Council to minimise the dissemination of illegal content." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1987">All branches of government, authorities and related institutions, including universities and research institutions, are obliged to follow the instructions of the cyber security office during operation of their computers and communication devices.</seg>
<seg id="1988">A recent Freedom House report, an American human rights organization, also mentioned these new surveillance methods:</seg>
<seg id="1989">In Xinjiang, on June 27, in a district of the regional capital of Urumqi, the authorities issued an ordinance with the directive to all residents and entrepreneurs to register their "personal ID cards, mobile phones, external drives, portable hard drives, notebooks and media memory cards" at the local police.</seg>
<seg id="1990">The intention is obviously to identify and destroy any "terrorist" videos. however, this action violates the personal rights of Urumquis three million inhabitants and gives them penalties for a whole range of other possible violations, including those relating to peaceful religious or political messages.</seg>

<seg id="2090">The Jordanian Rapper Emsallam Hdaib talks about the rights of the LGBTQ + community, freedom of expression and opposition</seg>
<seg id="2091">Emsallam Hdaib smokes a cigarette in his studio.</seg>
<seg id="2092">The photo was taken by Aman Madan, the original author of this text.</seg>
<seg id="2093">Emsallam Hdaib spends most of his time inside; sometimes he sips to his canvas, sometimes to his computer, back and back to his couch.</seg>
<seg id="2094">But what you can rely on is a cigarette between your fingers or your nicotine-stained lips.</seg>
<seg id="2095">He lives in the upper floor of his family house, which belonged to them since 1967; the year in which Israel completed his occupation of the West Bank and forced Hdaibs's family to escape from her village in Palestine, where they lived as felicyeen (about: Farmer).</seg>
<seg id="2096">For six years, Hdaib has been a passionate activist who faces the conservative majority and questioned their well-established opinions on gender roles, sexuality and freedom of expression through art and rapeseed music.</seg>
<seg id="2097">With his music, which often deals with topics such as orientalism, racism and the situation of Palestinian gearing, he also calls out the core of the entire Arab world. all these topics are not only relevant in his hometown of Amman, but also in cities that range from Damascus to Syria to Sanaa, Yemen.</seg>
<seg id="2098">With his 25 years, Hdaib sees himself as someone who is not restricted by boundaries in his mind, and he can feel with people suffering from the disastrous consequences of foreign interventions in countries such as Iraq, Yemen, Syria and Libya.</seg>
<seg id="2099">Even if he does not admit it openly, he has a special tendency toward U.S. foreign policy.</seg>
<seg id="2100">Hdaib contemplates his art in his studio in Amman.</seg>
<seg id="2101">Recorded by the author.</seg>
<seg id="2102">Hdaib does not believe that his sympathy for those who try to survive in war zones, to do anything with his identity as "Palestinian refugees from the second generation," he calls himself even though he was born in Jordan and has never been in Palestine.</seg>
<seg id="2103">"I don't think about my own circumstances of life," Hdaib emphasises.</seg>
<seg id="2104">Then he adds: "I think so, because I am a man," while in water dissolved Nescafé in two cups. it is the holy month of Ramadan; during this time it is intended for Muslims to fast from sunrise to sunset.</seg>
<seg id="2105">The Jordanian law also states that the public consumption of food during Ramadan is illegal.</seg>
<seg id="2106">Obviously Hdaib has a certain weakness to break with age-old traditions; on the other hand, a cup of coffee on a hot young day has little to do with protest against Islam.</seg>
<seg id="2107">In principle, the cheek of lukewarm coffee and the swaying of the Kent-cigarette in the nose first of all speak of freedom.</seg>
<seg id="2108">Sometimes Jordan feels like a prison under the open sky, especially if you look at neighbouring countries.</seg>
<seg id="2109">Therefore, it is easy to do basic things - as in the public during Ramadan - to drink water - in order not to land in prison.</seg>
<seg id="2110">Recently, the Interior Ministry of Jordan has cancelled a performance by the band Mashrou'Leila, already for the second time.</seg>
<seg id="2111">Some MPs who support the Islamic Action Front - the Jordanian branch of the Muslim Brotherhood - argue that the sexual orientation of the homosexual frontsman Hamed Sinno, contradicts the cultural and traditional norms of the country and is the main reason for the concert announcement.</seg>
<seg id="2112">The deputies and former press spokesperson of the Islamic coalition Dima Tahboub said in an interview with CNN that the concert was "just" because of the sexual orientation of the singer.</seg>
<seg id="2113">Many also claim that the engagement of the band in matters such as the Arab Spring, human rights and freedom of expression in the Arab world is dangerous activism, which poses the tried-and-tested legitimacy of authoritarian regimes across the region.</seg>
<seg id="2114">In a public statement, Mashrou'Leila estimated the Jordanian people as "progressive supporters of human rights," who continue to "opt for an intellectual and cultural pluralism."</seg>
<seg id="2115">This statement might not be simply shallow rhetoric, but actually mirrored a more and more clearly crystallizing reality in Jordan, which appears clearly in Hdaib's work.</seg>
<seg id="2116">In 2016, Hdaib returned to the traditional gender norms by forming his vision of the fate of Arab women who have marital sex.</seg>
<seg id="2117">The picture shows the skeleton of an apparently worn unknown woman, whose arms and legs stretch up to the corners of the canvas.</seg>
<seg id="2118">It is surrounded by a red lake; perhaps the blood of the countless women who have lost their lives by the hands of those whom they should actually trust.</seg>
<seg id="2119">In recent years, the number of 'laureates' has increased in Jordan - the unofficial outside.</seg>
<seg id="2120">According to Human Rights Watch, the number of laureates reached its peak in 2016; however, it is still difficult to add that Jordan is lacking institutional infrastructure to support women who have been victims of murder or domestic violence in appropriate ways.</seg>
<seg id="2121">According to a law on combating crime from 1954, women who are exposed to the danger of domestic violence can be arrested indefinitely in prison, "and for their release many years of bureaucratic expenditure and the guarantee of the family are often necessary for the woman to do nothing.</seg>
<seg id="2122">Hdaib's music also enjoys great popularity and is known to not shy away from subjects that are long considered taboo in his country.</seg>
<seg id="2123">Hdaib denies that his work is political, but admits that he cannot separate from politics full of explicit reference to sexuality, freedom and expression.</seg>
<seg id="2124">"I come from the Middle East, man.</seg>
<seg id="2125">"" "" "" "politics was intimidated to me," "" "" "" "he says." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2126">In a song called "Edward Sa'ed" Hdaib attacks the question of Palestinian identity.</seg>
<seg id="2127">In "Lawla al 3aib" and "Ghareeb," the focus is on poverty.</seg>
<seg id="2128">The list of songs that are political in the heart can be continued.</seg>
<seg id="2129">In March 2016, Hdaib published a song entitled "Santandano."</seg>
<seg id="2130">In this song, one verse often repeats itself:</seg>
<seg id="2131">"you are free, and everyone else is it."</seg>
<seg id="2132">In the further course of the song, Hdaib describes the world as a kind of market where, in his words, "that can get what you want" - whether it's faith or non-belief, heterogeneity or homosexuality.</seg>
<seg id="2133">He notes that hardly anyone in Jordan talks about gay rights and lesbians and that comments on the equality of LGBTQ + individuals have been censored until 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2134">In 2014 Hdaib conducted an interview for the popular Jordanian online program Roya, to note that his comments were torn out of context, twisted, and censored in his opinion.</seg>
<seg id="2135">"on Youtube it was uploaded without any cuts, but streamed was only a edited version," he says.</seg>
<seg id="2136">Today Hdaib is campaigning for the Arab LGBTQ + community and believes that intolerance to homosexuals does not disagree with Islam.</seg>
<seg id="2137">He mentions Abu Nuvo, a poet of the eighth century, still alive thanks to his homoerotic poems.</seg>
<seg id="2138">Hdaib asks himself: if Abu Nueva, who was later working on behalf of the caliph, could write openly about homosexuality in the eighth century, why can Jordanians not?</seg>
<seg id="2139">The real problem, so Hdaib, has nothing to do with Mashrou'Leila or the fact that the concert was canceled.</seg>
<seg id="2140">In the hashemian kingdom it is nothing new that the government sanctioned attacks on freedom of expression and that progressive voices are silenced.</seg>
<seg id="2141">Recently, in January 2017, the Jordanian Intelligence Service held several former government officials and members of the teachers' association, arguing that they have critical comments on social media comments related to the corruption that is deeply rooted in the country.</seg>
<seg id="2142">In view of this, Hdaibs's concert is, according to Hdaibs's opinion, only the tip of the iceberg - the real challenge is to make a structural change in the next generation of the Jordanians.</seg>
<seg id="2143">For him, progress is a constant giving and taking. Jordan has now denied Mashrou'Leila for the second time in a row, but the path of progress - that's Hdaib - consists of slow, thought and inner changes. he is sure that these changes take place from day to day in the heart of Jordanian society.</seg>
<seg id="2144">In the end, like millions of other Arabs, Hdaib dreams of an Arab world without intervention from abroad.</seg>
<seg id="2145">He does not only dream of bringing his work to Baghdad, Jerusalem and Damascus, but also to "experience it."</seg>
<seg id="2146">Perhaps the region will be approached with the help of music, art and literature of genuine and fundamental openness - and not by bombs, scattered unitions, and artificial kind of democracies. at least he hopes this.</seg>
<seg id="2147">Until the time has come, Hdaib will continue to rap and therefore also resist.</seg>
<seg id="2148">This report was made possible by the Pulitzer Center on Crisis Reporting, which Aman belongs to as Student Fellow.</seg>
<seg id="2149">Nebuta in Aomori is one of the 3 largest festivals in Japan.</seg>
<seg id="2150">These big, extravagant warriors puppets are so fantastic!!!</seg>
<seg id="2151">There are numerous theories about the origin of the Nebuta festival.</seg>
<seg id="2152">One supposes that it is a variant of the Tanabata Festival, which is usually also celebrated in August in many areas of Tohokus. another theory states that the trucks, drums and dancing came over more than a thousand years and come from a time when armies from the west of Japan marched into the northeast to force the indigenous inhabitants of the region, the emishi, to the knees.</seg>
<seg id="2153">We are at the Nebuta festival in Aomori.</seg>
<seg id="2154">We were able to grab some great seats, so we have a great view.</seg>
<seg id="2155">One can hardly imagine how big these parts are...</seg>
<seg id="2156">A community centre in the capital, Meguro Gajoen organised a two-month exhibition on Wa no Akari (literally).</seg>
<seg id="2157">I've been looking at the Meguro Gajoen for a long time now: two trucks are just to be seen.</seg>
<seg id="2158">Nevertheless, for many people who take the trip to Aomori, the Nebuta festival is the only true - and yet another breathtaking way to spend the summer:</seg>
<seg id="2159">"Yattemare!</seg>
<seg id="2160">Yattemare! "# Summer festival in the north of the country.</seg>
<seg id="2161">I was there and watched the # NebuchaFestival.</seg>

<seg id="2167">Rarely outer appearance and body care were as important as in this story, because they help to keep the Peruvian youth out of crime and to promote a legitimate profession like the hairstyle.</seg>
<seg id="2168">El Callao, Peru's most important port, is located on the coast of the Pacific Ocean near the historic center of Lima's capital, a region with a very high crime rate, where street robbery and illegal drug trafficking are everyday.</seg>
<seg id="2169">A survey published in April 2017 showed that 51.5 percent of the population of this region will not feel safe.</seg>
<seg id="2170">At the same time Peru - like many other Central and South American countries - experiences an increasing demand for aesthetic services for men.</seg>
<seg id="2171">The trend to copy the appearance and thus also the unusual hairstyles of famous sportsmen such as Paolo Guerrero (Peru), Arturo Vidal (Peru), Pedro Gallese (Peru), or Neymar (Brazil) has led to more and more regular citizens going into the hands of hairdressers who can recreate these elaborate hairstyles.</seg>
<seg id="2172">The unprecedented demand for hairstyles that go to the extreme limits of fantasy and creativity has even inspired an annual event, the competition of hairdressers "Batalla de Barberos," which has been held since 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2173">Experts will compete against each other to show who can create the most eccentric looks, as you can see in the following video (more videos on current competitions on the public Facebook profile Batalla de Barberos).</seg>
<seg id="2174">Educational institutions such as Augusto Salazar Bondy's school, located in El Callao, found an opportunity to persuade young people to exchange their weapons against hairdressers and to receive training in hairdressers instead of poor advice that allows them to find work.</seg>
<seg id="2175">Motivated by this activity and offering opportunities, dozens of young people have seen that they can take a job that is currently in fashion.</seg>
<seg id="2176">Before the school year beginning in March, the school offered special training workshops and reported on some of its successes:</seg>
<seg id="2177">In 1995 we were the only specialised school in the municipality and the district where we are very proud because we have built up this educational community for love with the children.</seg>
<seg id="2178">Colombia: love letters to guerrilla fighters</seg>
<seg id="2179">Photo: Valentina Monsalve.</seg>
<seg id="2180">Use with kind permission.</seg>
<seg id="2181">The following article is the edited version of the "declaration of love for guerrilla fighters" published by the international online magazine Tea After Twelve.</seg>
<seg id="2182">The article will be published as part of a partnership with Global Voices.</seg>
<seg id="2183">Why do we write only love letters to people we know?</seg>
<seg id="2184">Isn't it much more important to accommodate people who feel pushed out to get affection?</seg>
<seg id="2185">The young colombian activist Leonardo Párraga from the BogotArt Foundation and Cristian Palacios from Young-Youth Foundation did not leave their heads and inspired them to write letters to the campaign Cartas por la Reconciliación (letters to reconciliation), encouraging young people to write letters to guerrillas.</seg>
<seg id="2186">Only recently, their country was the scene of a historic event and they wanted to contribute their part: after years of negotiation, the Colombian government had concluded a peace treaty with the guerrilla movement FARC (German: revolutionary Armed Forces), which forms the conclusion of the longest armed conflict in Latin America.</seg>
<seg id="2187">International recognition of the Peace Treaty was so significant that the Colombian President José Manuel Santos received the Nobel Peace Prize for his merits.</seg>
<seg id="2188">Before Colombians, however, there is still a long way to speak of genuine reconciliation and peace.</seg>
<seg id="2189">Guerrilla fighters, who have lived in illegal camps for many years, were exposed to war rhetoric and had their arms around the clock, must now re-integrate into life as civilians.</seg>
<seg id="2190">The Colombian society, in turn, who had become accustomed to life in constant fear and in some cases of deep hatred of guerrilla fighters, must now take them in their ranks and support them in building a new life.</seg>
<seg id="2191">Leonardo and Cristian were convinced that the young Colombians would join together and help the integration process.</seg>
<seg id="2192">And that's exactly what they did: until now thousands of young people have already written letters - love messages to former guerrillas to welcome them back to society.</seg>
<seg id="2193">The aim of the campaign is 6900 letters - one for every former guerrilla fighter - to be handed over personally.</seg>
<seg id="2194">Valentine's Day as an inspiration for the campaign</seg>
<seg id="2195">The idea for the letter to reconciliation arose at the World Summit of Nobel Peace Laureates, which took place in Bogotá in February 2017. there Leonardo and Cristian had the opportunity to briefly speak with Kailash Satyarthi, which was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2196">He explained that we write thousands of love letters to the people we love on Valentine's Day, but forget those who need them much more unnecessary.</seg>
<seg id="2197">He plans to share his love with people this year, who needed the most urgent response.</seg>
<seg id="2198">So the plan arose to write letters full of hope and support to former fighters of the FARC, who now have to find their place in society and build up a new life. "the letters will show that Colombian society is ready to make the discourse of a history of war a common history of peace," they say.</seg>
<seg id="2199">So far more than 2,000 letters have been collected during the campaign.</seg>
<seg id="2200">The initiative is represented in all major cities of Colombia such as Cali, Manizales, Medellín, Barranquilla and Bogotá.</seg>
<seg id="2201">'i never thought that someone would forgive me '</seg>
<seg id="2202">The first 500 letters were handed over to one of the UN camps in the Caldono-Cauca region on 19 March.</seg>
<seg id="2203">A group of 40 students from Javeriana University in Cali, two members of the municipality of Cali and Leonardo of the BogotArt Foundation travelled to the camp to personally transfer the letters.</seg>
<seg id="2204">The members of the FARC set themselves up as they had done before to accept the orders of their leaders.</seg>
<seg id="2205">But this time they did not receive orders, but letters full of support from people from all over the country.</seg>
<seg id="2206">It was a very moving moment for everyone involved. "it's unbelievable how many different feelings one can go through in just a few hours - from fear to happiness and everything in between," told Manuela Jiménez Avila later.</seg>
<seg id="2207">Sandra Parra, a member of the governor of the province of Valle del Cauca, described this unforgettable experience:</seg>
<seg id="2208">After committing the letters, a former fighter led me through the camp of guerrilla fighters.</seg>
<seg id="2209">When I looked into one of the "Cambuches" (a kind of hut in which the guerrilla fighters live) I saw a guerrilla fighter who wrote something.</seg>
<seg id="2210">I was afraid to go down, because next to him on the bed was a MGL grenade, a deadly weapon in the Sleeping Beauty Sleeping.</seg>
<seg id="2211">"" "" "" "I answered and said," "" "" "" "Hello, what are they doing right now?" "" "" "" "he said," "" "" "" "I answer a letter to me." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2212">It is a very nice and hopeful letter.</seg>
<seg id="2213">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "I have never written so much in my life, so I answer it." "" "" "" "suddenly tears ran across the cheeks." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2214">I hugged him quite firmly, and sat down beside the pomegranates.</seg>
<seg id="2215">Perhaps he was tired of the war, he was tired of being all the years of the faithful companion of this warrior, and wanted to help him write this letter.</seg>
<seg id="2216">The man told me more about his life. he had never expected anything else from life than war. joining the FARC was the only way to save him and his six brothers before starvation. "I never thought anybody would forgive me for my mistakes.</seg>
<seg id="2217">But now I know that there is a society out there waiting for us with open arms.</seg>
<seg id="2218">Until now I have only learned how to deal with weapons.</seg>
<seg id="2219">"" "" "" "but now where peace reigns I can learn many things and work in dignity." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2220">New Voices</seg>
<seg id="2221">At the start of the event, students and some leaders of the FARC met for a discussion round.</seg>
<seg id="2222">The students were all grown up as already there was war and the FARC already acted in secret.</seg>
<seg id="2223">For this reason, the leaders of the FARC declared the history of the organization, their ideals, and gave insight into their views on the peace process: "for many years we have experienced how social injustice done on the part of the whole Colombian people. now, where we have the opportunity to develop into a political party, we can help shape society more just in this country.</seg>
<seg id="2224">"" "" "" "for a goal of this magnitude, it is worthwhile to overcome all obstacles," "" "" "" "said one of them." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2225">Manuela was impressed:</seg>
<seg id="2226">To hear those people who had never found a hearing and had no right to vote, and to recognize that the people I have often seen and hated as monsters, even those with beautiful feelings that were turned around by their circumstances and their environment, was very painful for me.</seg>
<seg id="2227">The reality in which the country is living hurts me.</seg>
<seg id="2228">But it comforts me that all people - including those who have killed and caused so much damage, can teach us something and give a smile and a hug.</seg>
<seg id="2229">Many former fighters responded to the letters.</seg>
<seg id="2230">Gustavo González, the commander of the camp in Caldono-Cauca, wrote for example Darío de Jesús Monsalve, Archbishop of the city of Cali, the following letter:</seg>
<seg id="2231">The Colombian was prophesied that after disarming would reign peace.</seg>
<seg id="2232">But this is not the case.</seg>
<seg id="2233">As long as there is inequality, hunger and lack of education, health care and employment opportunities, there will always be people who are ready to take arms, rise up and protest for their rights. and this is also completely justified (...).</seg>
<seg id="2234">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "we of the FARC are now on peace, on a policy without weapons." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2235">That is why we call on all defenders of peace - no matter what race, religion or ideology they belong to - to rise above all those who dream of a country in war.</seg>
<seg id="2236">We give you our word, make our contribution and offer sacrifices, because we know from our own experience that nothing is simple. those of us who defend life as the basis of existence will face many difficulties.</seg>

<seg id="2253">After experiencing a group of Chechens from the sex equation of their countrywoman, the hunt was opened on Sabrina.</seg>
<seg id="2254">In the last analysis, she went into the USA out of fear of her life.</seg>
<seg id="2255">Sabrina: I worked as a volunteer helper in a human rights organisation.</seg>
<seg id="2256">One day I was told that someone needed my help.</seg>
<seg id="2257">It was a friend from Dagestan, a transman who was in trouble.</seg>
<seg id="2258">She had no money, so I took her without hesitation.</seg>
<seg id="2259">While I tried to help her, someone from whom I thought he would be a friend, a copy of my documents and spread them anywhere on the internet, with my phone number and a picture of me. he sent them to his Chechen friends, with the following message: "then there are no more men in Chechnya that can eliminate this shame?"</seg>
<seg id="2260">After that, the photos from my documents made the round by WhatsApp.</seg>
<seg id="2261">On 10 October 2015 I was attacked.</seg>
<seg id="2262">When I was doing a few shopping bags from the back seat of my car, I heard a male voice saying: "here's a gift for you from your uncle."</seg>
<seg id="2263">When I turned around, I felt something in my body, but I did not hurt.</seg>
<seg id="2264">Then I heard a sentence, but this time in Chechnya: "how long will you still honor the family, you scandstain?"</seg>
<seg id="2265">I did not know the person.</seg>
<seg id="2266">I just know that it was a young man, not thirty years old.</seg>
<seg id="2267">Then I lost consciousness and eventually woke up at the hospital.</seg>
<seg id="2268">Apparently some women had all got along and started screaming.</seg>
<seg id="2269">The man had fled.</seg>
<seg id="2270">The women had called an ambulance.</seg>
<seg id="2271">In the hospital I learned that I had two stitches in my right lung.</seg>
<seg id="2272">OC Media: in which wings were you placed - in which of men or women?</seg>
<seg id="2273">Sabrina: my documents are dated, there is still my male name on it; but the doctor understood and put me to the women.</seg>
<seg id="2274">For this I am very grateful to him.</seg>
<seg id="2275">When I read his name for the first time at his office door, I was afraid to do it; it was a Muslim, a Caucasian name.</seg>
<seg id="2276">But he turned out to be a good person.</seg>
<seg id="2277">I am grateful to him that he is respectful with me.</seg>
<seg id="2278">I spent more than a month in hospital.</seg>
<seg id="2279">Last February I received threats.</seg>
<seg id="2280">They called me, wrote me - relatives, strangers, some completely unknown.</seg>
<seg id="2281">This was the beginning of a nightmare.</seg>
<seg id="2282">My family was visited by neighbors and some distant relatives.</seg>
<seg id="2283">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "they asked me to return to Chechnya in order to prove that it was all a lie." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2284">They made absurd demands: some told me that I had to prove it by going up without through the streets; others wanted me to appear on official TV in Grozny and say that I didn't change my sex that everything was just bad, and Photoshop.</seg>
<seg id="2285">I have grain size C - what would I have to say on TV?</seg>
<seg id="2286">OC Media: how did your family try to deal with this pressure?</seg>
<seg id="2287">Sabrina: it's still hard for them.</seg>
<seg id="2288">Some elderly people once spoke to my mother on the street.</seg>
<seg id="2289">"" "" "" "they said to her," "" "" "" "They have brought a monster to the world, which has not only broken your family but the entire republic." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2290">"" "" "" "we cannot touch you because you are a pious woman but you must disappear from here." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2291">It was too much for my mother and she put a rope around her neck.</seg>
<seg id="2292">Fortunately the neighbors came and saved them.</seg>
<seg id="2293">At that time I had to change the apartment several times a day.</seg>
<seg id="2294">I moved to an apartment and a few hours later there was a car with a darkened window and a number plate with a 95.</seg>
<seg id="2295">After it happened the third time it became clear to me that something was lazy.</seg>
<seg id="2296">My Human Rights friends reviewed the license plates - it turned out that I was persecuted.</seg>
<seg id="2297">OC Media: how did you flee?</seg>
<seg id="2298">Sabrina: with the help of activists.</seg>
<seg id="2299">For security reasons I don't want to reveal their names, but I want to say that I remember them all; they really helped me.</seg>
<seg id="2300">With their help I left the country, but then something unbelievable happened.</seg>
<seg id="2301">I can still not understand how it could be.</seg>
<seg id="2302">Shortly before my departure from Moscow I bought a new SIM card to call my mother as soon as I arrived.</seg>
<seg id="2303">I bought them without registering, without reference, without anything.</seg>
<seg id="2304">I broke my old SIM card and threw it into the trash.</seg>
<seg id="2305">Arrived and checked in at the hotel.</seg>
<seg id="2306">The number was registered for a stranger.</seg>
<seg id="2307">I put the SIM card into my mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="2308">In the moment I wanted to call my mother to WhatsApp, I got a message: "you don't think you're in security, just because you left the country?</seg>
<seg id="2309">Our people know in which hotel you are in. you even know your room number.</seg>
<seg id="2310">Just to prove it to you: it is number 115. "</seg>
<seg id="2311">Can you imagine that?!</seg>
<seg id="2312">This was actually my room number.</seg>
<seg id="2313">OC Media: are you still in contact with your family?</seg>
<seg id="2314">Sabrina: only with my mother and my sisters.</seg>
<seg id="2315">But we don't talk about gender equality, that's a taboo topic.</seg>
<seg id="2316">I still carry some traditionally Caucasian elements in me.</seg>
<seg id="2317">As much as I wish, I cannot overcome this mental barrier.</seg>
<seg id="2318">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "I always say that as long as my mother is alive, I will do my best to avoid hurting her." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2319">When we chat with camera, I actually try to figure out how the person looks from her past - so to my male form.</seg>
<seg id="2320">But that is very difficult.</seg>
<seg id="2321">OC Media: do you know about the current situation in Chechnya?</seg>
<seg id="2322">What do your friends do, those who have stayed there?</seg>
<seg id="2323">Sabrina: I submitted a report last week in Washington.</seg>
<seg id="2324">For this I needed topical information about the situation in Chechnya.</seg>
<seg id="2325">I talked to someone who sat in argun for one and a half months.</seg>
<seg id="2326">He told us that during Ramadan, no people were arrested and tortured, but also that all the end of Ramadan could hardly wait, and he did not exclude a new wave.</seg>
<seg id="2327">Most likely they will now focus on family and relatives.</seg>
<seg id="2328">With this I mean, they probably invite the relatives, these take care of the problem with the affected person and at the end require proof that the so-called "honor" has experienced through blood satisfaction.</seg>
<seg id="2329">OC Media: are gay men still being detained in these secret prisons?</seg>
<seg id="2330">Sabrina: a friend of mine says there are not so many.</seg>
<seg id="2331">If, then, especially those who have no wealthy relatives or who were dropped by their relatives in order to face Kadyrows's court.</seg>
<seg id="2332">As far as I know, they are held there to present them later as terrorists.</seg>
<seg id="2333">Say: if they are killed, they will show their bodies on TV and claim they had attacked any village or military base.</seg>
<seg id="2334">Do you understand?</seg>
<seg id="2335">As if these people were not simply disappeared, but deliberately immersed in order to radicalise themselves.</seg>
<seg id="2336">OC Media: is this just a guess or do you have a source for this information?</seg>
<seg id="2337">Sabrina: I just quote someone who was imprisoned for one and a half months in argun.</seg>
<seg id="2338">He says that many people have disappeared in this prison after having grown beard.</seg>
<seg id="2339">There was nothing new from them since then.</seg>
<seg id="2340">They simply took them along.</seg>
<seg id="2341">And this so-called Lord, that person was himself when these people were taken along.</seg>
<seg id="2342">Until now, however, they were not presented as bandits, there were no reports about that yet. we assume however that such actions are quite possible.</seg>
<seg id="2343">Why else would it not have allowed these people to shave?</seg>
<seg id="2344">Do you know if these persecutions and kidnappings of people belonging to a so-called "non-traditional" orientation have already taken place in the past?</seg>
<seg id="2345">Sabrina: I've always wore my hair long.</seg>
<seg id="2346">In Chechnya I had a Bob.</seg>
<seg id="2347">I think that before 2003 I was already known in Grosny when I was still living there - and I never had any problems.</seg>
<seg id="2348">Seriously!</seg>
<seg id="2349">Even from 1998 to 1999, when the sharia was considered, I never had any problems.</seg>
<seg id="2350">On the contrary, it was much safer than now.</seg>
<seg id="2351">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "Russia originally intended to bring us to the" "" "" "" "civilisation" "" "" "", "but ultimately threw us back into the stone age." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2352">OC Media: how is this possible under the Scharia law?</seg>
<seg id="2353">Sabrina: my eyebrows were plucked; I had dyed lashes, wore tubes jeans and short tops.</seg>
<seg id="2354">The Ministry of Safety of Sharia has never touched me just a hair.</seg>
<seg id="2355">In front of the Russian Theatre in Grozny there was a place where every evening, especially on weekends, there met a whole group of people like me.</seg>
<seg id="2356">It was a small place where several banks were standing, and the whole city knew about it; they knew why men, young people, met there.</seg>
<seg id="2357">We were never offended.</seg>
<seg id="2358">In the Chechen language there is a saying: Kharda ma Kharda. that is: "mock not about misfortune of another."</seg>
<seg id="2359">It is often said to be children when people make fun of the sick.</seg>
<seg id="2360">OC Media: so they simply shut their eyes before you, because they believed they were ill?</seg>
<seg id="2361">Sabrina: yes.</seg>
<seg id="2362">They never insulted me, never chased nor beaten.</seg>
<seg id="2363">OC Media: how long did this time of grace stop?</seg>
<seg id="2364">Sabrina: as long as Kadyrow entered the plan.</seg>
<seg id="2365">When he was appointed prime minister in 2005, he began to talk about morality on television.</seg>
<seg id="2366">He did not speak about us per se, but mainly about the behaviour of women.</seg>
<seg id="2367">Nevertheless - one could feel how people began to change in the city.</seg>
<seg id="2368">Those who had laughed and laughed before looked at you at once with suspicion.</seg>
<seg id="2369">In time I left Chechnya.</seg>
<seg id="2370">But every time I came back home I could feel how the situation in the Republic deteriorated steadily.</seg>
<seg id="2371">OC Media: what activity do you follow now?</seg>
<seg id="2372">Sabrina: I work as a waitress.</seg>
<seg id="2373">I don't earn much - 700 to 800 dollars a month are not much in the US.</seg>
<seg id="2374">Apart from that, I am still active as an activist.</seg>
<seg id="2375">Currently I am responsible for 15 Muslim women.</seg>
<seg id="2376">I communicate with them as a kind of psychologist.</seg>
<seg id="2377">We organize teacreffs, gatherings, I escort them to the hospital and help them to get food cards.</seg>
<seg id="2378">I don't have a penny for it for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="2379">I discovered these people by myself when I abused refuges.</seg>
<seg id="2380">I am Muslims and I want to help those who need help.</seg>
<seg id="2381">OC Media: do you wear a Hiddeab?</seg>
<seg id="2382">Sabrina: this is silly.</seg>
<seg id="2383">So nature is, it has nothing to do with religion.</seg>
<seg id="2384">This is exactly the same as Chetschenen, who want to make you white with foam before the mouth, that there are no wails with them.</seg>
<seg id="2385">The Dagestans have which, the cabarers, have which, the Russians have also which; on the whole planet they exist - but "not in Chechnya."</seg>
<seg id="2386">I come from there, so it's unpleasant to hear something like that.</seg>
<seg id="2387">I meet so many men from the Caucasus here.</seg>
<seg id="2388">Many of them - practicing Muslims who go to the mosque and fast during Ramadan - live together with men.</seg>
<seg id="2389">You know many think of transition to men who love men, and they believe that you change your sex to make more intimate experiences. but that's a fallacy.</seg>
<seg id="2390">These are two different things - two different types of feeling to be exact, different attitudes of life.</seg>
<seg id="2391">For me it is the most important thing to feel in my own skin and not to be ashamed of my body.</seg>
<seg id="2392">Not if I have a partner or not.</seg>
<seg id="2393">I'm sorry I'm going to be so personal here, but my last intimate relationship is now longer than a year ago.</seg>
<seg id="2394">And I'm not sad at all - I just know that I am now myself.</seg>
<seg id="2395">Local groups warn against an increase of suicide among the impoverished Arab Ahrazi community in Iran</seg>
<seg id="2396">The Iranian Ahraz region suffers from an unusually high unemployment and poverty rate within the native Arab population.</seg>
<seg id="2397">Since the last few months there has been a sharp rise in suicide.</seg>
<seg id="2398">The photo of the Arab workers in Iran was provided by the Patriotic Arab Democratic Movement in Ahwaz.</seg>
<seg id="2399">Photo: use with permission.</seg>
<seg id="2400">The self-burning of a man named Jassim Moramazi on August 27th drew the desperate situation of the Arab Ahwazi community in Iran, which is marked by poverty and unemployment, into the limelight.</seg>
<seg id="2401">Moramazi was married and had a child; he lived in Al-Thawra in the Ahwaz region in the south-west of Iran.</seg>
<seg id="2402">He suffered from anxiety, depression, and he was ashamed of his own helplessness, inability to pay for his family, so Ahwazi human rights groups who want to work in Ahwaz and remain anonymous.</seg>
<seg id="2403">A video shared to YouTube was holding the moments when he had lighted himself.</seg>
<seg id="2404">Some people quickly managed to extinguish the flames, and Moramazi was brought to the Taleghani hospital in the city of Ahwaz.</seg>
<seg id="2405">According to local sources, the burns were so strong that the doctors could not do anything more.</seg>
<seg id="2406">He died shortly thereafter.</seg>
<seg id="2407">It was not the only suicide that happened in August within the Arab Ahrazi Minority, and activists on site warn that even more men could take life.</seg>
<seg id="2408">The Ahrazi Centre for Human Rights reported that this month some others - Hamid Maniat, Ali Hazbawi, Sayed Falah Moussawi and Shahab Bani Tamim - hanged.</seg>
<seg id="2409">Their stories have one thing in common: they were all family patriarchs who felt helpless and unable to feed their families because of persecution on the part of the Iranian government, and to pursue a safe work.</seg>
<seg id="2410">Arab Ahwazi are suffering from poverty, unemployment and discrimination</seg>
<seg id="2411">The region in which a large part of the Arab Ahrazi community living in Iran has been shaken by a profound economic crisis that makes it hard for the local Arab population to make a living.</seg>
<seg id="2412">A century ago, the Arab Ahwaz was a predominantly autonomous region in Iran until the Pahlavi monarchy assumed power and undertook great efforts in 1925 to end ethnic autonomy throughout Iran.</seg>
<seg id="2413">In the Ahraz region, there are some of the largest oil and gas fields occurring in Iran, as well as some of the most profitable and valuable arable land for Iranian agriculture.</seg>
<seg id="2414">Despite these valuable resources, the regional economy continues to develop slowly, and the local population gets little from this wealth.</seg>
<seg id="2415">It is often a victim of ill-treated diseases, hunger and privations.</seg>
<seg id="2416">The Iranian regime will systematically deny the Ahwazi Arabs work in the local oil, gas and petrochemical industries.</seg>
<seg id="2417">The government has also built a large number of dams to redirect the water from the Arabic regions to the Persian territories, where the provinces of Isfahan, Yazd, Kerman and Ghom lie.</seg>
<seg id="2418">These dams have only led to aggravating the devastation caused by drought, and destroying local agriculture as well as the fish and palm industry.</seg>
<seg id="2419">The unemployment rate among the Arab Ahawk youngsters increased to 81%.</seg>
<seg id="2420">Nour Mohammed Pur, Iranian Director General for Cooperative, Labour and Social Welfare, reported that 5% of Ahwazis who are looking for a job completed primary school, completed 55% of secondary school and 45% graduated from university.</seg>
<seg id="2421">A "systematic strategy... aimed at destroying the spirit of national resistance"</seg>
<seg id="2422">Karim Dohimi, an Iranian Ahrazi human rights activist with residence in London, told Global Voices that the current situation, a mixture of "poverty, unemployment and racist ethnic discrimination" leads to a "high rise" of the number of suicide among young Ahwazi men.</seg>
<seg id="2423">The reason for this is a combination of a high number of ethnic Persian and an anti-Arab discrimination in the recruitment process:</seg>
<seg id="2424">Since officials and institutions prefer not to employ Arab workers, the local Arab Ahwazi is deprived of access to employment opportunities in all sectors.</seg>
<seg id="2425">This is part of a systematic policy of the ruling regime, aimed at annihilating the spirit of national resistance by young Arabs and forcing them to earn their living outside their home of Ahwaz.</seg>
<seg id="2426">There are people who have had to change their first and last name to hide their affiliation with the Ahwazi and be hired as even Arab names are not tolerated at the workplace, let alone speak Arabic language or wearing Arabic clothing.</seg>
<seg id="2427">Given the given circumstances that the Arab Ahwazi have to endure, human rights activists beat alert before the situation becomes explosive.</seg>
<seg id="2428">It remains to be seen whether the world is awake and aware of it.</seg>
<seg id="2429">The main reason for suicide is untreated depression.</seg>
<seg id="2430">Depression is treatable and suicide is avoidable.</seg>

<seg id="2433">"why I don't identify with feminism, even with the intersectionals"</seg>
<seg id="2434">Detail of a photo. recorded by Pixelay. published under the CC0 Creative Commons License.</seg>
<seg id="2435">The following article is a revised version of the statement written by Ayomide Zuri and originally published on the Afroféminas website.</seg>
<seg id="2436">You can read in the comments below the original text.</seg>
<seg id="2437">When I say that I am not a feminist, many women - especially white women who call themselves as intersectional feminists - react with frustration.</seg>
<seg id="2438">They wonder why I am not part of the movement.</seg>
<seg id="2439">They even put well thought-out scientific and social arguments before me why I should be feminist and why we should generally be all feminist * within.</seg>
<seg id="2440">For example, women still earn less money in spite of equal education than men.</seg>
<seg id="2441">That women are still under strict observation when it comes to what they are allowed to do with their bodies.</seg>
<seg id="2442">Violence against women is a global epidemic.</seg>
<seg id="2443">Or that cultural and social norms will still make sure that women come across a glass ceiling sooner or later in various spheres of life, and that discrimination based on gender is still moving across the many different countries and beliefs.</seg>
<seg id="2444">All of this is aware and known to me.</seg>
<seg id="2445">I am convinced, and I suffer twice and threefold.</seg>
<seg id="2446">I am a black woman.</seg>
<seg id="2447">And yet, when I come to speak on skin colour, on racism, on black women's women, on black women in the LGBTIQ community or on black women from the Diaspora; if I mention how we have always been abused in racial segregation and discrimination, both in and outside the feminist movement, many white feminists decide to remain silent.</seg>
<seg id="2448">But they all agree that women - all women - should come together to "uplift their voices and to" sing Kumbaya, my Lord, "in order to achieve equal rights (some) of women.</seg>
<seg id="2449">But they do not want to talk about the fact that sexualised violence, in addition to sexualised violence, gives a institutionalized form of racist-motivated violence, which we are exposed to black women in a twofold manner.</seg>
<seg id="2450">Or that black women and women of other ethnicities and places of origin earn less than white men and women.</seg>
<seg id="2451">That black girls and girls with a migration background are more often referred to as white girls, due to obvious integration problems.</seg>
<seg id="2452">Or that women in black spheres and women with a migration background are exposed to higher risk to suffer domestic violence and violence in partnership than white women.</seg>
<seg id="2453">On the one hand, I want all women, all men and all men of any skin color have the same rights; on the other hand, I can't join a movement in whose centre the white woman stands who refuses to take into account injustice in her mind, which relate to both the sex and the skin color of a person.</seg>
<seg id="2454">I am exhausted and will no longer fight for my affiliation in a white-feminist-oriented sphere that has always and repeatedly rejected me and countless other black women.</seg>
<seg id="2455">In 1851, Sojourner complained in her speech: "am I not a woman?" and I also refuse to uphold an ideology in which the black woman in historical regard is a dehumanly and marginalized being.</seg>
<seg id="2456">I refuse to join groups which also absorb our customs and customs through cultural appropriation to promote their egocentric agenda.</seg>
<seg id="2457">For some of them will continue to hold the importance of black women for the feminist movement, no matter how many black women try to teach them for the better.</seg>
<seg id="2458">Although Intersectionale Feminism was founded to give women of different backgrounds a home and distinguish themselves from white feminism, still the word "feminism" is still in its name.</seg>
<seg id="2459">I prefer to release myself entirely from feminism and join the movement of the Womanism created for my dark skin and my status as a woman, rather than using me for a white-feminist paradigm that is so persistent that intersectionality is celebrated as a novel phenomenon.</seg>
<seg id="2460">Now it is more important than ever that we define black women according to our own ideas and move into the spheres that are created by us for us.</seg>
<seg id="2461">Clenora Hudson-Weems, the author of the book Africana womanism: claims (such as: Africa-Womanism: how we ourselves recapture ourselves) speaks of that we can defend ourselves by defining ourselves in our own way. and not only that - black women can also create spaces in which they are completely safe and in which the cultural, mental, psychological, physical and even the spiritual elements can be worshipped which make up the black woman.</seg>
<seg id="2462">Although some white and intersectional feminists will immediately call separatism and exclusion after reading these lines, I ask you to inform yourself about the hypocrisy and the contradictions of the feminist movement, of which the black woman is affected.</seg>
<seg id="2463">In a womanistic environment I can lift up black women and women of other cultures, because in this paradigm I exist.</seg>
<seg id="2464">I am recognized as a part of this paradigm because of my dark skin and because of my existence as a woman.</seg>
<seg id="2465">I, a black woman, can flourish in an environment in which my life is neither ignored nor ignored nor rejected.</seg>

<seg id="2488">In many cases, women are also financially dependent on the men who abuse them. this also explains why only 20% of all women who admit to be victims of violence should report at all to the law enforcement agencies.</seg>
<seg id="2489">Contents 1 Strike and Statistical 2 Invisible mistreatations and a legal system that nothing submisses Paraguayan's laws: good approach, poor implementation impacts and statistics</seg>
<seg id="2490">It is hard to determine how many women are really ill-treated, says Myrian González, a researcher for gender issues at the Centro de Documentación y Estudios, a social scientific research institution in Paraguay. "there are different statements and reports that do not even show the extent of gender-specific violence against women in Paraguay," she explains.</seg>
<seg id="2491">The available figures, however, are alarming.</seg>
<seg id="2492">In 2015, 9600 advertisements for domestic violence took place at the District Attorney Office. 70% of it revolved around violence against women.</seg>
<seg id="2493">86% of the ads used by the police came from women.</seg>
<seg id="2494">There were more than 5,000 adverts due to domestic violence in the Peace Courts. 86% of women's advertisements came here as well.</seg>
<seg id="2495">In the advertisements 40% of women said that they were physically abused, 55% of women spoke of psychological abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2496">These statistics however do not show the true extent of violence against women in Paraguay.</seg>
<seg id="2497">According to the Paraguayan women's minister Ana Baiardi, only a few of these crimes are actually shown. "on every woman refunded in Paraguay because of psychological abuse, 9 women who do not.</seg>
<seg id="2498">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "at the end of 2014, two women who do not do this are entitled to any woman who is refunded because of physical abuse." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2499">Since women's homicide in Paraguay is not an individual criminal offence, the law enforcement agencies cannot appropriately document how many women are murdered every year by their current or former partners.</seg>
<seg id="2500">By August 2016 alone, journalists counted at least 12 cases of women's murder in the country.</seg>
<seg id="2501">The coordinator for human rights in Paraguay documented at least 37 cases where women were murdered by their current or former partners.</seg>
<seg id="2502">According to their estimates, in Paraguay every ten days dies a woman because of violence by men.</seg>

<seg id="2504">Invisible mistreatment and a judicial system that undertakes nothing</seg>
<seg id="2505">Before Mariana Brítez became the firm friend of Carlos Vera, he insisted that she called him the names of all her former friends.</seg>
<seg id="2506">In the beginning she didn't want it, but then gave up. this should always regret her.</seg>
<seg id="2507">Today Mariana is 28 years old and no longer together with Carlos. but for two years she bore the psychic violence, one of the most common forms of violence against women and at the same time the most recognisable:</seg>
<seg id="2508">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "I never thought I would once become victims of abuse." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2509">When I read about it earlier, I always thought that this only happened to women who are too submissive because they let themselves be deceived by violent men.</seg>
<seg id="2510">I was convinced that this would never happen to me.</seg>
<seg id="2511">Mariana used social media to report about abuse by Carlos Vera.</seg>
<seg id="2512">Without naming a name, she wrote posts on Facebook, in which she described his insults and various attacks during her two-year relationship and told how he had isolated them.</seg>
<seg id="2513">Many people responded to their contributions, including Carlos himself. he asked rhetorically whether he had ever raised his hand against them and refused to confess that his behaviour was also a form of abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2514">Other Facebook users asked Mariana why she had liked it so long by Carlos and did not leave him earlier.</seg>
<seg id="2515">It seemed almost as if they wanted to say that victims of abuse had at least a certain complicity.</seg>
<seg id="2516">Victoria Santos, who did not come from Paraguay, fought almost eight years with the authorities in Paraguay to prove that their former partner abused them.</seg>
<seg id="2517">Victoria is a member of the network Yo te Creo ("I believe you") consisting of women who are all victims of abuse in any way.</seg>
<seg id="2518">In the group they can talk to others about their experiences, listen to each other and support each other.</seg>
<seg id="2519">They do what many others do not do: they take the statements of women seriously.</seg>
<seg id="2520">In Victorias case everything started with mental abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2521">Her wealthy partner even managed to convince her that she was worthless.</seg>
<seg id="2522">Then he began to beat them.</seg>
<seg id="2523">They did not support Victorias advertisements with the authorities without a result and also from their relatives.</seg>
<seg id="2524">She led a trial against her former partner, who developed into an unpredictable legal struggle between Paraguay and her native country in which it was mainly about money, power and the influence of her former partner.</seg>

<seg id="2528">Carmen Echauri, a representative of the UN organisation for women in Paraguay, also sees great problems in applying the laws in the country.</seg>
<seg id="2529">On 10 August 2016, a bill was discussed at the Paraguayan Parliament, which was known under the hashtag # Porelas (# 1).</seg>
<seg id="2530">This hashtag and the # NiUnaMenos movement (# failure) are part of a campaign on Twitter that is supported by Amnesty International.</seg>
<seg id="2531">The original draft of the law stipulates that Femizid becomes an independent criminal offence and punish him harder as it is already in the neighbouring countries of Argentina and Bolivia.</seg>
<seg id="2532">Thus the bill was changed in some points to win the deputies for the law, which feared that the way for decriminalisation of abortions would be paved, which are banned in Paraguay up to five years imprisonment.</seg>
<seg id="2533">The original draft bill envisaged the majority of the (bureaucratic and economic) procedural costs which the victims of violence need to bear even if they simply want to submit an advert and receive a safe housing to impose the state.</seg>
<seg id="2534">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "Echauri argues that the law is not effective if the legislature does not provide sufficient funds for it:" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2535">In Paraguay, abuse is seen as part of interpersonal relationships.</seg>
<seg id="2536">Here a rethinking has to take place, so that violence can no longer be viewed as something normal.</seg>
<seg id="2537">Those who are silent in the face of these facts are complicit and contribute to the offense of the perpetrators.</seg>
<seg id="2538">We must reimburse for such a long time until mistreatment is no longer considered normal.</seg>
<seg id="2539">On 10 November 2016, the law was passed in the Paraguayan Senate. prior to that, parts of the law were changed, among other things a passage that the partners called for reconciliation in cases of domestic violence.</seg>
<seg id="2540">The opinions on the changes go apart.</seg>
<seg id="2541">The section on Reconciliation has been seen as an opportunity for the aggressor to attack his victim again.</seg>
<seg id="2542">The submission of the words "sex," "political violence" and "sexual harassment" from parts of the law, however, is regarded as a great setback.</seg>

<seg id="2547">More than a year ago, the Romanian authorities closed the independent Arab-language newspaper Azamn because of their reporting on corruption in the sultante.</seg>
<seg id="2548">Yousef Al-Haj, one of the editors of the newspaper, is still in prison, where he is serving a yearlong prison term.</seg>
<seg id="2549">Two other editors of Azamn, Ibrahim Al-Maamari and Zaher Al-Abri, were also arrested and tried in court but later released.</seg>
<seg id="2550">Oman has been governed by Sultan Qabus ibn Said since 1970, who came to power after having served his father, Said ibn Taimur, by a coup d "état.</seg>
<seg id="2551">Since then, in addition to his role as the sultan, the main ministries in the country: Prime Minister, Minister of Defence, Supreme Commander of the Armed Forces, Finance Minister, Foreign Minister, President of the Supreme Council for Planning and President of the Central Bank.</seg>
<seg id="2552">The Sultans rule is marked by the persistent efforts of the security forces, especially of domestic secrecy, restricting public freedom, including freedom of the press, and torture human rights defenders, independent journalists, bloggers and other activists to intimidate and incarcerate.</seg>
<seg id="2553">The authorities systematically limit peaceful and legitimate activities in the area of human rights and prevent citizens, even activists, to express their views on public affairs such as corruption in authorities and institutions both online and offline.</seg>
<seg id="2554">The attack on the newspaper Azamn, its closure and the detention of three of its editors last year is a hard blow to press freedom in the country.</seg>
<seg id="2555">Azamn is an independent newspaper published since its inception in 2007 on corruption in Oman (an absolute monarchy) until it was banned by the authorities in August 2016.</seg>
<seg id="2556">On 28 July 2016, security forces Ibrahim Al-Maamari, editor-in-chief of Azamn, announced that an article entitled "High-ranking parties bind hands to justice" was published in the newspaper on 26 July 2016.</seg>

<seg id="2560">On August 3, 2016, Zaher Al-Abri, Member of the Editorial Board, was invited by the ISS for the special department and arrested by the security forces upon his arrival.</seg>
<seg id="2561">On 9 August 2016, the ISS arrested the deputy editor-in-chief Yousef Al-Haj, who had acted as chief editor after Al-Maamaris's arrest.</seg>
<seg id="2562">The paper was closed indefinitely after the Minister of Information had given the instruction that "publication and dissemination of the paper on any means, including online, was banned from August 9, 2016."</seg>
<seg id="2563">On 26 September 2016, the first trial of the trial against Al-Maamari, Al-Haj and Al-Abri took place in Maskat.</seg>
<seg id="2564">The court sentenced the three journalists to prison terms and ordered the final closure of the newspaper.</seg>
<seg id="2565">Al-Maamari and Al-Haj were both convicted of disturbance of public order, "misuse of the internet," and "undermining the state of the state."</seg>
<seg id="2566">In addition, Al-Haj was found guilty of the violation of a ban on publication and the slander.</seg>
<seg id="2567">Al-Maamari and Al-Haj were sentenced to three years of imprisonment and fines in the amount of 3,000 omaniacal rial (7800 US dollars).</seg>
<seg id="2568">Al-Abri was sentenced to a year of imprisonment and a fine of 1000 Rial (2600 US dollars) after he was found guilty of the use of an information network to disseminate material that could pose a threat to public order.</seg>
<seg id="2569">For Al-Abri, a security deposit of 5000 omani rial (13,000 US dollars) was set and he was released on 22 August 2016 before the pronouncement of the sentence.</seg>
<seg id="2570">The Appeals Court acquitted Al-Abri in a hearing on 26 December 2016, but sentenced Al-Haj to six months in prison for one year and Al-Maamari.</seg>
<seg id="2571">Al-Maamari was released on 10 April 2017 after serving his six-month prison sentence from the Central Prison in Maskat. al-Haj is still in prison, where he served as a prison sentence.</seg>
<seg id="2572">The Appeals Court also raised the Ministry of Information's decision to close the newspaper "Azamn."</seg>
<seg id="2573">In spite of the Court's decision to permit Azamn again, the paper still faces attacks by the omanic government.</seg>
<seg id="2574">On 8 January, the Minister of Information issued an order with which the closure of Azamn was extended by three months.</seg>
<seg id="2575">On 8 May 2017, the Minister of Information himself signed another statement in which the closure of "Azamn" was extended by three additional months and with which the minister once more opposed the decision of the Appeals Court to republish the publication of the paper.</seg>
<seg id="2576">The ongoing closure of Azamn and the attacks on journalists of the newspaper are not the only cases in which the press freedom was violated in Oman in recent times.</seg>
<seg id="2577">Further injuries include, for example, the closure of the website of the independent magazine Mowatin and the exercise of pressure on Albalad, the first independent online newspaper of the country to cease its operation.</seg>
<seg id="2578">Due to the ongoing closure of Azamn and the detention of the journalist Al-Haj, the impression that the Japanese authorities are still not ready to put an end to the extensive violation of freedom of the press.</seg>
<seg id="2579">Gulf Centre for Human Rights (GCHR) calls on the Korean authorities to:</seg>
<seg id="2580">1. release Yousef Al-Haj immediately and unconditionally;</seg>
<seg id="2581">2. to create a safe environment for the newspaper Azamn so that their journalists can pursue their work;</seg>
<seg id="2582">3. to protect freedom of the press in the country and</seg>

<seg id="2587">Ranjit Warrier 2016 in Zambia, mapping takes place with his consent</seg>
<seg id="2588">Medical research in Africa is rarely mentioned or even mentioned in the media. this is a growing area addressing one of the most urgent needs of the continent.</seg>
<seg id="2589">There are two reasons for the need for medical research carried out on-site: on the one hand many medicines and vaccines are missing in the global healthcare system, covering special medical need on the African continent.</seg>
<seg id="2590">Diseases such as AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria have far more serious effects than elsewhere in the poorest countries of Africa than elsewhere, and lack of investment for the investigation of these diseases by the pharmaceutical companies is a big problem.</seg>
<seg id="2591">Second, research carried out by African scientists will help build its own research capacities in Africa. a major role of science and technology can only be conducive to the economic growth of the continent.</seg>
<seg id="2592">Dr. Ranjit Warrier is Director of the Centre for Research on Infectious Disease in Zambia (Centre for Infectious Disease Research in Zambia, CIDRZ).</seg>
<seg id="2593">He grew up in Lusaka, Zambia in the 1990s, when the AIDS epidemic had first serious implications for national health.</seg>
<seg id="2594">He left Zambia for a study in the United States, initially in Louisiana, later in Indiana.</seg>
<seg id="2595">When postdoc at the University of Pennsylvania he researched the HIV virus himself before he decided to go back home in order to support the Ministry of Health.</seg>
<seg id="2596">With Global Voices, Dr. Warrier discussed the future of medical research in Zambia and about misunderstandings of the media about this research.</seg>
<seg id="2597">(Disclaimer: Dr. Warrier speaks as a private person).</seg>
<seg id="2598">Global Voices (GM): what is your research topic?</seg>
<seg id="2599">Ranjit Warrier RW: at the moment the focus of my work is on the application of research results. I support the national programme for antiretroviral therapy (ART) with laboratory tests.</seg>
<seg id="2600">I also started a research program for the development of molecular diagnostic tests for HIV, TB and other relevant pathogens.</seg>

<seg id="2602">How do they differ from those in Western countries?</seg>
<seg id="2603">RW: there is no basic research here. we only use solutions that have been developed elsewhere.</seg>
<seg id="2604">This has to change, otherwise we will always remain recipients instead of being a creator.</seg>

<seg id="2607">Is it sufficient?</seg>
<seg id="2608">How easy or difficult is it to find suitable scientists for the projects?</seg>

<seg id="2611">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "it is difficult to find people who want to come back or move here, because financing and development opportunities are better in other countries." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2612">GM: what is the research infrastructure?</seg>
<seg id="2613">What obstacles are there in your routine research work that you didn't have before?</seg>
<seg id="2614">RW: the basic infrastructure does not meet the standards in developed countries. it costs a lot of money to have a continuous supply of electricity, water and internet.</seg>
<seg id="2615">Laboratory equipment is expensive, and it takes months to import it from other countries.</seg>
<seg id="2616">GM: what is the opinion of the public about science and scientists in Africa?</seg>
<seg id="2617">RW: there is already interest, but only a very limited understanding of scientific methods.</seg>
<seg id="2618">I would suggest that critical thinking and scientific methods should be taught in schools to improve the situation.</seg>
<seg id="2619">GM: how big is your opinion on the potential of scientific research in Africa, what should it focus on, and how can we support development?</seg>
<seg id="2620">RW: the potential is amazing.</seg>
<seg id="2621">I have seen great students of all ages.</seg>
<seg id="2622">There is a need for special scientific training, starting at any age.</seg>
<seg id="2623">Social sciences, computer science, big data, researching the space, healthcare (non-communicable and infectious diseases) and the efficiency of traditional medicine will benefit greatly.</seg>
<seg id="2624">GM: can you describe the advantages and disadvantages of life as scientists in Africa versus Western countries based on your experience?</seg>
<seg id="2625">RW: often, it's the limited speed to do things, and the difficult access to scientific expertise that poses challenges here.</seg>
<seg id="2626">The system that magazines make articles accessible only against payment (the so-called "Paywall"), also limits the amount of available information and the speed of research.</seg>
<seg id="2627">From the USA to India: how "open source" seed producers change global food production</seg>
<seg id="2628">This post by Rachel Cernansky was originally published on the website Ensia.com, a magazine that reports on solutions for environmental problems worldwide.</seg>
<seg id="2629">Frank Morton has been growing salad in the USA since the 1980s.</seg>
<seg id="2630">Its company offers 114 grades, such as Outrageous, the first plant cultivated and consumed by NASA astronauts in space.</seg>
<seg id="2631">For almost 20 years, Morton's work was limited only by his own resourcefulness and the question of how many kinds of salad he can get.</seg>
<seg id="2632">But at the beginning of the 2000 he noticed that more and more salads were patented and that he could not use them further for breeding.</seg>
<seg id="2633">The patents filed not only for individual varieties, but also for certain properties, such as resistance to diseases, a special red or green tone or crimped leaves.</seg>
<seg id="2634">In recent years, more and more such patents have been applied to more and more plants such as cereals or carrots. due to this trend, plant breeders, environmentalists and experts ensure food security for the future of food production.</seg>
<seg id="2635">As a passionate representative of a millennia-old tradition, Morton still breeds salad, but now he needs longer since his work is increasingly difficult due to more and more restrictions.</seg>
<seg id="2636">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "it is as if a boulder in a river is lying around which I must paddle." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2637">So we have to do that now, but it's a break with the breeding tradition, "he says." I think these patents go too far for salads.</seg>
<seg id="2638">And if they stand before the court, no one can breed a new sort of lettuce, because all the features are already patented. "</seg>
<seg id="2639">However, it is very careful and endeavours not to use any material that is protected as intellectual property.</seg>
<seg id="2640">He has also joined a movement that is growing bigger in the U.S. and around the world: open Source Breeding (Open Source Breeding).</seg>
<seg id="2641">Astronauts of the International Space Station ISS have grown and ate red Roman salad of the Outrageous variety in the "glasshouse" of the station, where it is tested whether plants can be grown in space.</seg>
<seg id="2642">Photo: NASA</seg>
<seg id="2643">It is no coincidence that this name sounds rather like the movement from the IT field and not from the field of plant breeding.</seg>
<seg id="2644">The Open Source Seed Initiative (initiative for open-source seeds) is inspired by the movement for free "open source" software that provides alternatives to copyrighted software.</seg>
<seg id="2645">It was launched to ensure that some plant species and genes are not protected as intellectual property and thus permanently usable for plant breeders.</seg>
<seg id="2646">In the context of the initiative, called Ossi, US farmers can commit themselves to free use of seeds bred by them.</seg>
<seg id="2647">However, this does not mean that they do not continue to do business with their seeds and sell it. "open source" breeders only allow others who purchase their seeds to breed it in order to breed their own varieties and do not immediately sow - two aspects which are banned or prescribed by many plant patents.</seg>
<seg id="2648">Dozens of breeders and seed companies have already joined the initiative since their launch in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2649">More sombre prospects</seg>
<seg id="2650">For the professor at the University of Wisconsin-Madison and Ossi board member Jack Kloppenburg, control over seeds and the possibility of breeding new plants are both important for food security and environmental protection.</seg>
<seg id="2651">According to him, seed plays a role in larger contexts such as biodiversity, farmers' rights, control of the food system and the use of chemicals in agriculture. independent breeders would try to use the latter not or only little by raising seeds with natural resistance.</seg>
<seg id="2652">Kloppenburg emphasises that the "open-source" movement does not work with genetically modified plants.</seg>
<seg id="2653">All kinds of plants could be patented, whether vegetables, grain, genetically modified or not, from ecological agriculture or not. "in order to achieve our goal of ecological sustainability, we need control over seeds," he says, taking into account the increasingly common mergers in the global agricultural industry. "anyone who wants to buy good, locally and sustainably produced vegetables should also know that the way this vegetable is bred is threatened.</seg>
<seg id="2654">"" "" "" "food sovereignty without seed sovereignty is not possible." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2655">The members of the Open Source Seed Initiative are committed to making their seeds available to others. in contrast, their approach is to patent seeds and plant attributes.</seg>
<seg id="2656">Photo by Jack Kloppenburg.</seg>
<seg id="2657">Ossi supporters argue that the future of food supply is endangered as the available gene pool is constantly shrinking due to the increasing number of intellectual property rights on plant material, which is therefore always restricted.</seg>
<seg id="2658">Claire Luby, executive director of the Ossi, has engaged in her doctoral thesis with genetic variation in carrots and their availability. she found out that about a third of all the key characteristics are protected as intellectual property, which makes it suitable for plant breeders either not or only complicatedly.</seg>
<seg id="2659">For other plants, such estimates are not yet available, but experts like Luby assume that maciously cultivated plants such as wheat are patented in even greater style than lettuce or carrots.</seg>
<seg id="2660">A question of view</seg>
<seg id="2661">Plants are grown in such a way that they have specific desired characteristics - from those through which their taste or color improves to such, because of which they thrive in certain environments and can withstand threats such as pests or diseases.</seg>
<seg id="2662">Opponents of patents on plant properties point out that the available plant material for breeders is decreasing due to more and more patents. at present, genetic diversity is more necessary than ever since the changed conditions are much worse due to climate change.</seg>
<seg id="2663">In an email, Monsanto Speaker Carly Scaduto acknowledges that genetic diversity is generally important and also vital for Monsanto's activities. with a total of four gene banks and cooperation with institutions such as the United States Department of Agriculture, the company is committed to maintaining genetic diversity.</seg>
<seg id="2664">However, it does not contradict the notion that intellectual property protects other breeders because "patents and the protection of plant varietets promote innovation." a patent is basically a plan that anyone can follow as soon as the patent has expired.</seg>
<seg id="2665">Often these instructions help others to get the same result with another method.</seg>
<seg id="2666">"" "" "" "so such protection does not hinder innovation, but promotes it by providing more material and know-how to the public." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2667">Morton sees it different: waiting for 20 years until a patent expels, certainly does not promote innovation.</seg>
<seg id="2668">And if you have to wait so long to grow on plants that are adapted to the changed environmental conditions, you would have already lost the battle.</seg>
<seg id="2669">But the main argument for Morton is that genetic resources have always been a common good and should remain: "independent plant breeders have neither the time nor the money for such formalities, and monetary incentives are not attractive to us.</seg>
<seg id="2670">We want farmers to make their work easier.</seg>
<seg id="2671">"" "" "" "this is what drives us and it is impossible for us to continue to use the best and newest genetic resources." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2672">"" "" "" "altogether, Morton is interfering with the concept of patenting plant attributes:" "" "" "" "we don't really create the features themselves." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2673">The plants form themselves and as breeders we finally have no idea how the plants do this.</seg>
<seg id="2674">A secret of nature. "</seg>
<seg id="2675">For Carol Deppe, plant breeder in the Oregon and Ossi board member, there is another important aspect of plant breeding: "he who breeds a variety also breeds his own values into it.</seg>
<seg id="2676">Those who believe in industrial agriculture with large farms and monocultures, for whose cultivation mole herbicides are needed, breeds this concept of agriculture in its varieties.</seg>
<seg id="2677">"" "" "" "my concept is exactly opposite." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2678">While some medium-sized companies (those who move on international markets, but smaller than Monsanto) patents, most smaller seed companies manage to survive without patents - either they reject the patent or they consider it too expensive and therefore not worthwhile or both are the case.</seg>
<seg id="2679">The independent plant breeder Frank Morton is looking for Salate in his breeding garden.</seg>

<seg id="2681">Morton also believes that breeders would be more innovative by avoiding plant patents: "it looks like I am with my efforts to produce something new, stronger than companies that patent.</seg>
<seg id="2682">I constantly need new material for my catalog, because I know that my competitors will sell my varieties in a few years themselves, "he says." with a patent, one is protected for 20 years ahead of competition, which makes it really easy for my opinion. "global response</seg>
<seg id="2683">Although the US seems to be a leader in "open source" breeding, the concept is now spreading rapidly around the world.</seg>
<seg id="2684">In India, the Centre for Sustainable Agriculture ("Centre for Sustainable Agriculture"), which describes itself as a professional organization in the field of resources, uses an open-source seed programme.</seg>
<seg id="2685">It also supports them to come to "open source" seeds and sell their own.</seg>
<seg id="2686">The German organisation Agrecol is working on an open-source licence, which ultimately constitutes a formal and legally binding form of Ossi's commitment to breeders in the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2687">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "rules for breeding are different from country to country, which is why the Ossi commitment cannot simply be taken one to one in Europe or other parts of the world." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2688">At the beginning of November 2016, the executive of the European Union, the European Commission, announced that conventionally bred plants should not be patentable, thus referring to the current practice of the European Patent Office that patents on conventionally bred plants.</seg>
<seg id="2689">However, a declaration is not a law yet; it is now at the governments of the Member States to bring the patent office to implement this new line.</seg>
<seg id="2690">In October 2016, the Dutch organization Hivos hosted a conference on "open source" seed systems in Ethiopia where farmers, operators of seed banks and representatives of governments, NGOs and seed companies from all over East Africa came together to learn about the "open source" seed movement and the worldwide trend towards seeds patenting.</seg>
<seg id="2691">Willy Douma, responsible for Hivos' program for "open source" seed systems, explains that the organization is currently building a global alliance for "open source" seed systems for which the official launch is scheduled next year.</seg>
<seg id="2692">A consortium of environmental and development groups (including Hivos, the international non-profit development organisation USC Canada and the Action Group on erosion, Technology and Concentration) has compiled a database of seed and biodiversity around the world to publish the Seed Map Project, a seed map.</seg>
<seg id="2693">In September, the Global Alliance for the Future of Food, the Global Alliance for the Future of Food, has published a report from organisations such as the WK Kellogg Foundation, McKnight Foundation and others.</seg>
<seg id="2694">The report also emphasises the importance of a diverse local supply of seeds for sustainable food systems - a context that Luby von Ossi hopes that more people will soon see him.</seg>

<seg id="2720">Human rights organisation and blog are the latest targets of censorship in Egypt</seg>
<seg id="2721">The Egyptian authorities still block content on the internet.</seg>
<seg id="2722">This time it was the website of a human rights organisation and the blog of a columnist.</seg>
<seg id="2723">On the weekend of 5 August, the Egyptian government blocked the website of the Arabic Network for Human Rights Information (ANHRI), which documents human rights violations in Egypt and the Arab world.</seg>
<seg id="2724">In August, the network published a statement on Facebook, which criticised the Egyptian authorities for this step and promised to continue the work and efforts for human rights in the region.</seg>
<seg id="2725">The Arabic Network for Human Rights Information remains true to its goal in defending freedom of expression and human rights in the Arab world. even though it has never been so difficult to continue to pursue these goals, it has never been as important as now. ANHRI acknowledges that all technical possibilities are exhausted to overcome the blockade and not give in. we insist on further fulfilling our task.</seg>
<seg id="2726">ANHRI is considered the first censored website of a human rights organisation in Egypt after the authorities blocked 21 sites over two months ago, for example the independent news page Mada Masr, Arab-language edition of the Huffington Post and the Al Jazeera network originating from Qatar for alleged "support of terrorism."</seg>
<seg id="2727"># Egypt: 1. human rights organisation of the wave of site barriers to victims. @ anhri is one of the main sources of human rights in Arabic language https: / / t.co / NIZmOpDS5K</seg>
<seg id="2728">Besides ANHRI, the blog of the columnist and human rights researcher Ahmed Gamal Ziada has no access to Egypt.</seg>
<seg id="2729">Ziada used his blog for the distribution of columns and articles, which he writes for in Egypt non-accessible websites and media.</seg>
<seg id="2730">Now the blog, which he set up to circumvent the censor apparatus of the Egyptian government itself, became the target of an attack.</seg>
<seg id="2731">Blogger, the provider with which Canada's blog is also located, is further accessible.</seg>
<seg id="2732">Ziada, a former photojournalist, spent nearly 500 days in captivity after he was arrested by Egyptian security forces in December 2013, while he reported on the student protests and recorded a video on how police exercised physical violence against two students.</seg>
<seg id="2733">His articles mainly revolve around politics and the human rights situation in Egypt.</seg>
<seg id="2734">In a Facebook comment, Ziada expressed the blocking of the government and reflected what this means for him:</seg>
<seg id="2735">The blogs to ban blogs is very old, but has priority in the era of Abdelfattah al-Sisi; and even if the blogging of the blog may not be significant to the world, it is for two reasons for me:</seg>
<seg id="2736">1) It has been possible for them to convey a sense of siege to me; an arrest, an attempted murder, a charge of the National Security Council, the blocking of blogs and any other web page I worked for.</seg>
<seg id="2737">2) You have proven that I did not write in vain. in other words, my words have influence, if only to a small audience.</seg>
<seg id="2738">I would like to mention that this blog was an archive for me.</seg>
<seg id="2739">First, I used it to post articles to circumvent censorship.</seg>
<seg id="2740">But now, after blocking it and that they are afraid of words, I can still change the link or create a second blog.</seg>
<seg id="2741">The brave go the way to the end.</seg>
<seg id="2742">According to the Association for Freedom of Thought and Expression (afte) Egyptian authorities blocked 133 websites from 24 May to 06 August. this resulted in technical tests in the networks of various Internet Service Providers (ISP), including Orange, Vodafone and ETISALAT.</seg>
<seg id="2743">Afte also documented the blocking of vendors that were possible through the circumvention of internet censorship and private surfing, so-called Virtual Private Networks (VPNs)</seg>
<seg id="2744">Afte reported in her research:</seg>
<seg id="2745">On Monday, 12 June, we noticed how the blocking of web pages that VPNs offered began.</seg>
<seg id="2746">Such a practice suggests the government's intention to continue blocking and filtering content on which Egyptian users could have access.</seg>
<seg id="2747">The situation is additionally exacerbated by the fact that the censorship decisions are made behind closed doors, which means that the Egyptian population has no legal basis with which they can act against these actions in court.</seg>
<seg id="2748">Now the question arises: how far is the Egyptian government ready to go to censorship and who will attack it next?</seg>
<seg id="2749">Is Rio de Janeiro in war?</seg>
<seg id="2750">The inhabitants argue.</seg>
<seg id="2751">The Brazilian army used in the Favelas in Niterói, a city in the state of Rio de Janeiro, during the government crisis.</seg>
<seg id="2752">Photo by: Estado Maior (CML) via photos públicas, CC-BY-NC 2.0</seg>
<seg id="2753">Day after day newspapers report in Brazil with dark headlines from Rio de Janeiro, the second largest city in the country and home to numerous postcard motifs.</seg>
<seg id="2754">Some of these headlines are as follows:</seg>
<seg id="2755">"14-year-old shot at school," "Every second day a police officer is murdered in Rio de Janeiro," "Thieves Robben pharmacy with military weapons," "President Temer sends 8500 troops of the army, navy and air-air to Rio."</seg>
<seg id="2756">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "in the midst of the economic crisis and in a tense financial situation, the 2017" "" "" "" "Violence" "" "" "" "reached the highest level for 10 years." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2757">The Brazilian non-governmental organization Global Justice even called upon the United Nations to intervene.</seg>
<seg id="2758">Reports like these have become commonplace and this is unacceptable & # 8212; find at least the managers of a local newspaper.</seg>
<seg id="2759">So the newspaper "Extra" known for detailed reporting on violence in Rio, on 16th August, published the editorial "That's not normal," in which she announced to set up a new section called "War in Rio."</seg>
<seg id="2760">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "all reports on violence in the city are now published there." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2761">The newspaper explained the motives for their decision:</seg>
<seg id="2762">Extra will continue to report on crimes that happen in every major city in the world like murder, robbery, sexual crimes, etc., but what happens to the civilized standard and what happens only in Rio will be published in the heading "War in Rio." (...) This is our way of calling: this is not normal!</seg>
<seg id="2763">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "this is the only alternative so that we as journalists do not close our eyes to cruelty." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2764">In a four-minute video shared on Facebook, Octávio Guedes, editor-in-chief of the newspaper, explained that this decision was not an occasion for pride, but rather a sign of failure:</seg>
<seg id="2765">Extra is probably the only newspaper all over the world with a war of war in a country that does not recognize war at all.</seg>
<seg id="2766">In the same video, a journalist says that according to the Institute for Internal Security in Rio de Janeiro, there are 843 areas controlled by criminal organisations.</seg>
<seg id="2767">In the editorial the newspaper writes:</seg>
<seg id="2768">We are aware that a war discourses if it is distorted, can also be used to retouch atrocities of the police, who only shoot and then ask questions.</seg>
<seg id="2769">But we defend the war based on information and the fight against corruption in the police whose aim is not the civilian population, but the economic power of the Mafia and its partners.</seg>
<seg id="2770">Does the term "war" harm more than it benefits?</seg>
<seg id="2771">In an article on the news portal The Intercept Brasil, the journalist Cecília Oliveira, on the other hand, argues that violence is called "war." this is in her opinion a justification of the failed security policy by the media and could make it more difficult to hold accountable to the police.</seg>
<seg id="2772">This is not a war.</seg>
<seg id="2773">This is the result of corruption and poor planning - as demonstrated in the analysis of military operations in Rio itself - in combination with insufficient investment in personnel, education and a historical and self-pleasing neglect of public service.</seg>
<seg id="2774">Remember: the state of Rio de Janeiro is bigger than just its capital.</seg>
<seg id="2775">A peace march in Niterói in the state of Rio de Janeiro in honour of the murdered cultural organizer Rafael location.</seg>
<seg id="2776">Photo by: Fernando Frazão / Agência Brasil. publication with kind permission.</seg>
<seg id="2777">Calling Rio de Janeiro as "the most violent place in Brazil," according to Cecília is wrong: "22 of the 30 most violent cities in Brazil are according to statistics of 2015 in the north and northeast of the country. these are the latest available data.</seg>
<seg id="2778">None of these cities are located in the state of Rio de Janeiro.</seg>
<seg id="2779">"" "" "" "if we look at the murder rate per state," "" "" "" "Rio is in place 16" "" "" "", "she writes." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2780">The company Globo, the largest media company in South America, is especially one of the biggest media companies in South America, which, like Cecília, has been emphasizing the state's security policy for years.</seg>
<seg id="2781">The creation of the UPP (Unidade de Polícia Pacificadora), a police unit established by the State of Rio in 2003, was also part of these security policy measures, whose aim is to capture a favela by using a massive police racket and permanently stationing a unit there.</seg>
<seg id="2782">In the beginning, this actually resulted in a decrease of violent deaths. however, after several years, the UPP was increasingly under fire after several reports on harassment and repression against the poor communities, which should actually protect the newly created police unit.</seg>
<seg id="2783">On his Facebook page, journalist João Paulo Charleaux selected one of his articles from 2010, in which he explains why violence in Rio does not comply with the criteria set out by the Geneva Convention for the designation "Civil War."</seg>
<seg id="2784">He writes:</seg>
<seg id="2785">In addition to legal issues, the classification of the situation in Rio as a war also causes serious consequences for the people.</seg>
<seg id="2786">This calls for the state to use resources and means typical of a war. this includes penetration into the territory of a "enemy," where a civilian is a sharp point in the landscape and becomes an object for "collateral damage" and "stray bullets."</seg>
<seg id="2787">War back or forth, fact is that the inhabitants of the favelas in Rio continue to suffer.</seg>
<seg id="2788">It is a week ago that the police ercled the mountain with the Favela Jacarezinho in order to avenge the death of a policeman.</seg>
<seg id="2789">In the midst of all this violence this incident also made headlines: a salesman died as a result of shots fired by the police from a helicopter.</seg>

<seg id="2802">Since the beginning of the Syrian revolution in 2011 and the ensuing civil war, many Syrian cities suffer from brutal siege and blockades, mainly by the Assad regime against loyal troops.</seg>
<seg id="2803">According to victories Watch, a joint initiative of the PAX peace organisation and the research institute, The Syria Institute, is currently around one million Syrians in a state of siege in Damascus and Umland, Homs, Deir Ezzor and Idlib.</seg>
<seg id="2804">The region of East Ghouta is particularly affected, where an attack with chemical weapons on 21 August 2013 demanded the lives of hundreds of civilians.</seg>
<seg id="2805">Many governments, international organisations and the Syrian opposition are based on investigations by the United Nations and other human rights organisations that the massacre of the Assad regime was perpetrated.</seg>
<seg id="2806">Since 2013, these rebel-controlled areas outside Damascus have been under siege, leading to the need for local residents, tunnels and control points to rely on smuggled food.</seg>
<seg id="2807">Due to the years of blockade, traditional food such as meat has become unattainable for large parts of the population.</seg>
<seg id="2808">As a countermeasure, a group of Syrian humanitarian workers and academics is teaching the inhabitants of East Ghoutas to plant their own mushrooms as a "life-saving food source."</seg>
<seg id="2809">They call themselves Ghiras Alnahda and carry out the project together with the NGO Al-Adala.</seg>
<seg id="2810">Mushrooms do not belong to traditional foods cultivated in Syria and are rarely part of the Syrian cuisine. however, their food makes them an attractive source of food for many residents of the besieged East Ghouta.</seg>
<seg id="2811">The Directly of the project, Abo Nabil, said to the French news agency AFP:</seg>
<seg id="2812">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "we chose the cultivation of mushrooms because they have a high nutritional value, similar to meat, and because they can plant them in houses and cellars." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="2814">To earn money for the initiative, we use the Humanitarian crowdfunding platform CanDo in consultation with the NGO Ghiras Alnahda.</seg>
<seg id="2815">It is planned to convey 125 families knowledge of planting mushrooms, Dr. Leila becomes Global Voices.</seg>
<seg id="2816">At the time of the constitution of this article, they have reached over 100% of their expected target of around €12,700, but will continue to collect donations to CanDo until Monday, September 04, 2017.</seg>
<seg id="2817">The initiative depends on generators that keep the temperature stable at 25 ° C and humidity at 80%.</seg>
<seg id="2818">Because of the fuel shortage, locally produced plastic propellants are used to supply the generators with the necessary energy.</seg>
<seg id="2819">Dr. Leila said Global Voices that they began "production from the regions originating from the regions" before verifying their quality and whether they are suitable for consumption.</seg>
<seg id="2820">Then they planted a small mushroom yard in a tub. when this succeeded, they used a larger tub. and so on.</seg>
<seg id="2821">Now they have designed a "educational farm for the region."</seg>
<seg id="2822">Since the beginning of the project and after another 3 months, they have distributed mushrooms everywhere in East Ghouta free of charge.</seg>

<seg id="2833">Several hundred people were protesting in many of Portugal's capital cities on 21 October, calling for justice for the victims of the fires raging in the north of Portugal in the week before.</seg>
<seg id="2834">Forty-two people died and some 70 were injured as a result of the forest fires of 15 and 16 October. this resulted in the government calling for a mourning period last week from solidarity with the victims for 3 days.</seg>
<seg id="2835">Fires were also recorded in Galicia in Spain, where there were 4 deaths.</seg>
<seg id="2836">It is estimated that there were more than 500 fire outbreaks that spread in the northern and central regions of the country and reached approximately 250 million hectares of forest and numerous villages.</seg>
<seg id="2837">In June there was a similar tragedy in Pedrógão Grande, where there were 64 deaths and more than 200 deaths.</seg>
<seg id="2838">According to the European forest monitoring system, which monitors forest areas by satellite photographs alone in 2017, approximately 500,000 hectares of forest are burned in Portugal - an area of the size of the Lisbon district.</seg>
<seg id="2839">So that you can make a better picture of the seriousness of the situation: there is no fire only in 4 districts.</seg>

<seg id="2844">The foreseeable tragedy</seg>
<seg id="2845">The goal of Saturday's protests was the demand for better preventive and fire fighting measures by the state.</seg>
<seg id="2846">People asked why the Civil Guard was unable to curb the extent of the tragedy as far as possible.</seg>
<seg id="2847">João Soveral of the Federation of Farmers of Portugal explained the paper Público:</seg>
<seg id="2848">The streets and villages were evacuated to Pedrógão for everything and nothing.</seg>
<seg id="2849">This Sunday they did not do it anywhere: there are dozens of open roads that were surrounded by fire.</seg>
<seg id="2850">"" "" "" "in the forest of Leiria, a similar tragedy could have happened in June, as the streets were closed very late." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2851">In addition, building permits in locations with high fire risk are questioned.</seg>
<seg id="2852">A far-reaching proposal for the reform of the forest, which the government had brought in after serious fires in 2003 and 2005, was objected by the local authorities who saw the new rules as an obstacle to investment.</seg>
<seg id="2853">"the government carried out a slackening of the law allowing construction activity to fall if the applicant had a means of self-protection - that was an open back door, so that everything could be built," João Sorval proceeds in the same article by the paper Público.</seg>
<seg id="2854">The environmental organization Quercus pointed out that large areas with eucalyptus trees, trees made of easily inflammable wood, spread like in a vicious circle, according to fires of this kind.</seg>
<seg id="2855">These problems add that the website of the civil defence of Portugal on 15 and 16 October, when people sought information or attempted to contact their relatives, was offline.</seg>
<seg id="2856">It was a private initiative that provided the population with information: it took advantage of its own civil protection data using the application fogos.pt and informed the population in real time about the location and the spread of fires.</seg>
<seg id="2857">The project was launched by the developer João Pina in 2015 to simplify the work of the fire brigade and was not able to resist this fateful weekend in October that the servers were not able to resist the onslaught of the 400,000 users who followed the fires: the site counted more than half a million requests.</seg>

<seg id="2875">At that time Asharaf Barati, a 13-year-old boy belonging to the ethnic group of Hazara, sat together in Ghazni Province in Central Afghanistan for the last time with his family at dinner.</seg>
<seg id="2876">Even if his mother didn't tell her then she knew she wouldn't see her son for a long time - maybe even more.</seg>
<seg id="2877">In the dawn the boy should break.</seg>
<seg id="2878">His uncle would pick him up and bring him to the tugs.</seg>

<seg id="2884">Abdul Ali Mazari, the leader of the Hezb-e-Wahoo party dominated by Hazara, had just been murdered by the Taliban and many Hazara felt unprotected.</seg>
<seg id="2885">The Taliban, known for their hatred of the Hazara, came closer and closer.</seg>
<seg id="2886">Many Hazara left the country towards Pakistan or Iran.</seg>
<seg id="2887">A few days after his escape, Asharaf found himself in Pakistan.</seg>
<seg id="2888">For a few years he worked in a coal mine. the work was difficult and made him sick.</seg>
<seg id="2889">Then he took what was left of his little wage and went to Iran. once again he was in a foreign country together with other refugees and dragged sacks with mortars that were heavier than he himself to make a living.</seg>
<seg id="2890">Back then, like today, the life of Afghan refugees in Iran was characterised by misery and exploitation.</seg>
<seg id="2891">"it was really hard," Asharaf recalled in an interview with Global Voices. "we (Afghan refugees) lived in an empty building on the construction site, on which we also worked.</seg>
<seg id="2892">There were no services and no heating there. we put nylon in front of the open windows to avoid freezing at night. "</seg>
<seg id="2893">After four years, Asharaf left his life without papers in Iran and was ready for the journey to Europe.</seg>
<seg id="2894">During the dangerous crossing on the sea he suffered shipwreck and stranded on a small, uninhabited Greek island.</seg>
<seg id="2895">After the Greek authorities refused asylum, Asharaf joined Italy in 2002.</seg>
<seg id="2896">Some time Asharaf was homeless, ran alone through the streets of Rome, slept in parks and went to a church that distributed food to needy people twice a day.</seg>
<seg id="2897">It is true that due to relatively high yield rates Italy is a kind of second chance for rejected asylum seekers. however, it is also true that the conditions that find asylum seekers in the country are catastrophic.</seg>
<seg id="2898">The human rights organisation Civil Liberties Union for Europe writes that the system "suffers from a general lack of transparency.</seg>
<seg id="2899">"" "" "" "the vast majority of asylum seekers are accommodated in over 3000" "" "" "" "special recording centres" "" "" "" "in the hands of unqualified and unqualified personnel." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2900">According to the Italian law, asylum seekers can only be allocated to an admission centre if they have officially submitted an application for asylum - which may go for months after the application of the asylum application.</seg>
<seg id="2901">Until then, people who do not have money for accommodation are either dependent on the hospitality of friends or have to sleep on the street.</seg>
<seg id="2902">So it was also Asharaf.</seg>
<seg id="2903">But his lack of life helped Asharaf to get rid of these conditions soon.</seg>
<seg id="2904">After spending several years working in the construction industry, Asharaf found his entire savings in the establishment of a hostel in Venice.</seg>
<seg id="2905">This went so well that after a while he opened a second hostel and a fast-food bar.</seg>
<seg id="2906">Asharaf Baratis's success story is now subject of the documentary "Behind Venice Luxury - a Hazara in Italy" (German: "behind venetian luxury - a Hazara in Italy") by the director Amin Wahidi.</seg>
<seg id="2907">The film won the Venice City Award in 2017, which was awarded for the 24th time in 2017.</seg>

<seg id="2911">The conditions for entrepreneurs in Italy - especially for non-Italians - are very difficult.</seg>
<seg id="2912">A lot of bureaucracy, high taxes and conditions for loans are just a few of the obstacles.</seg>
<seg id="2913">According to inofficial estimates, about 20,000 Afghans live in Italy.</seg>
<seg id="2914">For many of them, the country is a transitional solution on the way to other European countries.</seg>
<seg id="2915">In recent years, some Afghans operated companies, including tailors, travel agencies, hotels and restaurants.</seg>
<seg id="2916">Some Afghan restaurants were even praised in the Italian press for their excellent cuisine.</seg>
<seg id="2917">In Venice, Hamed Ahmadi had the idea of his restaurant Orient Experience where the waiters and the kitchen staff were mostly refugees from different parts of the world.</seg>
<seg id="2918">The menu of the restaurant tells the story of their trip to Italy through the various Afghan, Iraqi, Turkish and Greek dishes.</seg>
<seg id="2919">The Afghan entrepreneur Ali Khan Qalandari opened the Peace & amp Restaurant in Padua, and also behind the pizzeria Kabulogna in Bologna and a sushi restaurant in Rome there are also Afghans.</seg>
<seg id="2920">However, Asharafs targets extend far beyond the Italian hospitality industry and retail and aim back to the country he forced to leave as a teenager.</seg>
<seg id="2921">"where there is a risk, there are also possibilities," says Asharaf with a smile. "I want to invest in Afghanistan.</seg>
<seg id="2922">I have never forgotten my country and I cannot live happily if I know my people are suffering.</seg>
<seg id="2923">I plan a project for farmers from the poorest provinces of the country, especially for women.</seg>
<seg id="2924">"" "" "" "they represent half of society and must get the same possibilities as everyone else." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2925">Asharaf also forged plans for the opening of a factory in Kabul, where people can learn packaging and conservation techniques. "thus they can sell their crop surpluses on the market and improve their financial situation," he says.</seg>
<seg id="2926">The development of a successful entrepreneur was a journey through uncertainty and doubt, but in the end stand stability and prosperity.</seg>
<seg id="2927">Asharaf has made this journey for himself. now he wants to help other Afghans on this path.</seg>

<seg id="2929">He reported on the evacuation of the Raba'a el Adaweya camp in Cairo, protesting against the decomposition of President Mohamed Morsi.</seg>

<seg id="2931">Global Voices Advocacys Netizen's report is an international snapshot that shows challenges, wins and emerging trends in global Internet rights</seg>
<seg id="2932">The Egyptian parliament has reviewed a bill that foresees that users can only use social media such as Twitter or Facebook after registering with a government authority.</seg>
<seg id="2933">Users must register to use social networks within six months of submitting a valid bill of law on the authority's website, stating their full name and ID number.</seg>
<seg id="2934">Anyone who missed this step could be sentenced to six months' imprisonment or tribulations of a penal payment.</seg>
<seg id="2935">The law, which was advertised by sixty members of parliament, is currently in the legislative and constitutional committee of the Parliament and is to be debated there.</seg>
<seg id="2936">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "in May another member of the Bundestag submitted a proposal to introduce tougher sanctions for the insult of the president or a senior civil servant." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2937">Under the law proposition, however, such a deed would be punished with prison and fines, as legal experts of the Tahrir Institute for Middle East Policy.</seg>
<seg id="2938">If the law is to be passed, this may mean three years in prison for the condemned.</seg>
<seg id="2939">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "furthermore, this would support a political climate in which the right to freedom of expression and freedom of assembly has been in danger already for many years." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2940">A striking example is the case of the Egyptian photographer Mahmoud Abo ZID (known as Shawkan) who captured Egyptian policemen while demonstrating violence against demonstrators who demonstrated against the military coup that had led to the removal of the elected president Mohammed Morsi.</seg>
<seg id="2941">Shawkan was waiting, as more than 700 protesters, who had been arrested in the same incident, four years in prison for a trial date.</seg>
<seg id="2942">Recently, his trial was postponed to 20 May because the prison administration failed to bring the accused from prison to the courtroom, according to human rights groups.</seg>
<seg id="2943">Shawkan threatens the death penalty due to one, so many human rights groups agree, mock load of among others weapons possession, illegal assembly, murder and attempted murder.</seg>
<seg id="2944">In another case, a criminal court in Giza acquitted the two journalists Hany Salah-el-Deen and Mosad Al-Barbary. they were charged with their coverage of pro-Morsi's seat blockade on Raba'a Al-Adawiya square in Cairo.</seg>
<seg id="2945">The Court also reduced the punishment of the journalists Abdullah al-Fakharany, Samhi Mustafa and Mohamed al-Adly, who were also arrested in the previous incident, from 25 years to 5 years.</seg>
<seg id="2946">Interrogating Tunisian activists to infiltrated documents</seg>
<seg id="2947">In May, Tunisian authorities spent six hours with the interrogation of Sami Ben Gharbia, who is co-founder of the independent media platform Nawaat and the Global Voices Advocacy Project.</seg>
<seg id="2948">Ben-Gharbia was driven mainly to a continuous action plan. according to the plan, the plan comes from the President of the Republic, who, according to the plan, explicitly supports a controversial draft bill that would guarantee business people and during the former regime by dictator Zine el-Abidine Ben Ali of corruption.</seg>
<seg id="2949">The document published on April 21 on the website of Nawaat throws a light on how the presidential plans for the support of the legislation look like.</seg>
<seg id="2950">Ben-Gharbia leaned the naming of his sources, stating Article 11 of the Tunisian press committee, which journalists have the right to protect their sources.</seg>
<seg id="2951">Nevertheless, he appeared as a witness in the District Court of Tunis on May 09.</seg>
<seg id="2952">Does China want to force the users of social media to show their ID?</seg>
<seg id="2953">According to new regulations of the Information Bureau of the People's Republic of China, the users of social media in China need permission before they write or share messages in social media.</seg>
<seg id="2954">In the Regulations it is also stated that registration will be required with the full real name.</seg>
<seg id="2955">Analysts suspect that this will allow the elimination of anonymous comments in social networks within social networks. it is still unclear how the authorities will apply these regulations.</seg>
<seg id="2956">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "Chinese citizens have proposed in the social media to enforce these regulations only selectively in order to protect citizen journalism and its independence." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2957">Can we see ourselves in "WeChat"?</seg>
<seg id="2958">Not in Russia!</seg>
<seg id="2959">In May, the state censorship of Russia blocked access to the latest Chinese messaging app WeChat.</seg>
<seg id="2960">"" "" "" "according to Roskomnadzor, WeChat failed to register with the state government as" "" "" "" "organizer of information distribution." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2961">This term is part of a law from 2014, thanks to which the Russian government conducts a list of online services, which organize the "publication of information." the law also allows the government to make use of said services to remove content and to force it upon request for termination of user data.</seg>
<seg id="2962">These websites currently include websites such as Vcontacts and Odnoclassniki (Russia's two most popular social networks), the image Board 2.ch.hk, the email service mail.ru and dozens of other services.</seg>
<seg id="2963">Turkish court decrees Wikipedias</seg>
<seg id="2964">A Turkish court ruled Wikipedias in Turkey, after Wikipedia administrators refused to delete two English-language articles, the data that Turkey supports the jihadists in Syria.</seg>
<seg id="2965">The Turkish Ministry of Transport, Maritime Affairs and Communication admitted that the site was closed because it became an information source collaborating with groups to foment a political defamation campaign against Turkey. "</seg>
<seg id="2966">It is the first time that Turkey completely blocks the website. it is therefore, among other things, China, one of the few countries around the world where access to Wikipedia is not possible.</seg>
<seg id="2967">Great Britain cannot stop sniffing</seg>
<seg id="2968">After this week, the UK government is in the midst of a targeted consultation with regard to increased surveillance powers that would force Internet service providers to monitor communications in real time and to install Backdoor programs that encrypt data encryption.</seg>
<seg id="2969">The government has consulted telecommunications companies and secret services regarding the proposal, but has left other technology companies and civil society outside.</seg>
<seg id="2970">Despite all this, the consultation will continue until May 19. reactions and proposals by members of the public can be forwarded to the Ministry of the Interior.</seg>
