this is James Ris@@ en .
you might know him because he won the Pul@@ itzer Prize as a New York Times repor@@ ter .
long before anyone heard of Edward Snow@@ den , Ris@@ en wrote a book in which he published spectacular that the N@@ SA illeg@@ ally heard phones of Americans .
but it is another chapter that should leave a lasting impression .
in this he describes a cat@@ astrop@@ hic US intelligence operation in which the CIA was literally dra@@ fting dra@@ fts for a nuclear bomb .
if that sounds crazy , read it .
it is an incredible story .
but do you know who didn &apos;t like the chapter ?
the U.S. government .
for almost 10 years , the government has identified Ris@@ en and called upon him to call his alleged sources .
in this turn , he became a symbol of the pattern of the government to condemn whi@@ st@@ leb@@ lower and spy on journalists .
according to the First Constitution , the media has the right to publish secret information .
but it is impossible to apply this right if media do not get this information and if they cannot protect the identity of the brave they reveal .
so when the government kno@@ cked at Ris@@ en , he did something that many courageous repor@@ ters had already done before him : he refused and said he would rather go to prison .
from 2007 to 2015 Ris@@ en lived with the risk of going to prison .
but then , just days before the trial , something extraordinary happened .
suddenly , although they have given years information that it is essential in their case , the demands of the government in Ris@@ en have been dropped .
the reason : in the time of electronic monitoring , the repor@@ ters and sources can hide themselves less and less .
instead of separating and breaking the Ris@@ en , this could also do his digital foot@@ prints for him .
and so the investig@@ ators , without his consent , have secretly ap@@ pre@@ h@@ ended his phone calls ,
just like his email data , financial and banking information , his credit reference , and even travel reports with the list of his flights .
in the midst of this information , they found evidence they used to condemn Jeff@@ rey Sterling , a CIA whi@@ st@@ leb@@ lower and Ris@@ en &apos;s supposed source .
unfortunately , this is only one of many cases .
President Obama promised to protect whi@@ st@@ leb@@ lower , but instead the judi@@ ci@@ ary condemned more than all US governments in front of him .
now you can imagine how this can be a problem , especially because the government classi@@ fies too much of its work as secret .
since September 11 , almost every article on national security was the result of a whi@@ st@@ leb@@ lower going to a journalist .
we therefore put the press work on the game , which is to be protected by the first constitutional additive , because the government has more and more possibilities to spy on everyone .
but just as the government &apos;s technology allows to circum@@ vent the rights of repor@@ ters , the press can also use technologies to better protect their sources .
and they can do that from the moment they contact , rather than in hind@@ sight , in witness stand .
today there is communication software that has not existed when Ris@@ en had written his book , and it is much safer than normal emails or phone calls .
one such technology is Sec@@ ure@@ drop , an open source transmission system for whi@@ st@@ leb@@ lower , which was originally developed by the Internet world famous Aaron Swar@@ tz , and today has been further developed by the Freedom of the Press Foundation .
instead of sending an email , go to a news site like the Washington Post here .
there you can upload documents or send information , as with any regular contact form .
these are then encrypted and stored on a server that only the respective news agency has access .
so the government can no longer secretly obtain information , and many of the information it would request would not be available from the outset .
Sec@@ ure@@ Drop is only a small part of the whole in order to protect freedom of the press in the 21st century .
unfortunately , governments around the world are developing new sp@@ ying technologies that je@@ op@@ ardi@@ se us all .
it is important to us to ensure that not only technology drivers like Edward Snow@@ den have a chance to kill the mis@@ deeds . it is just as important that we protect the next whi@@ st@@ leb@@ lower ,
or the next environmental worker who al@@ erts an alarm to the contaminated water of F@@ lin@@ t . or a Wall Street insi@@ der that warns us of the next financial crisis .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after all , these technologies were not only made for those who want to expose crimes but to protect our constitutional rights . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
thank you .
&#91; on April 3 , 2016 , the biggest data leak of history was published . &#93; &#91; the &quot; Panama Pap@@ ers &quot; revealed that wealthy and mighty &#93; have hidden &#91; enormous sums of money &#93; in tax ha@@ v@@ ens . &#93; &#91; we asked Robert Pal@@ mer of Global Wit@@ ness for an explanation . &#93; This week we were asked about a leak of 11 million documents from the Panama @-@ based law firm Mos@@ sack Fon@@ sec@@ a
the publication of these documents gives a small insight into the secret world of tax ha@@ v@@ ens .
we get an idea of how clients , banks and lawyers go to companies like Fon@@ sec@@ a Mos@@ sack and say : &quot; okay , we need an anonymous company . can you set it up ? &quot;
we actually see emails , the exchange of messages as the whole system works as it works .
this has already led to very direct consequences .
Iceland &apos;s Prime Minister res@@ ig@@ ned .
there are also reports that an ally of the brutal Syrian dict@@ ator B@@ asch@@ ar al @-@ Assad has mail@@ box companies in tax ha@@ v@@ ens .
it is said that a track of USD 2 billion leads to Russian President Vladimir Putin , about a close friend of children &apos;s days , a famous cell@@ ist .
now there will be a lot of ri@@ cher people out there and others waiting nerv@@ ously for the next release , and on the next revealed documents .
now that sounds like the plot of an agent &apos;s book or a John @-@ Gr@@ is@@ ham novel .
it seems to we@@ ep away from you , me , ordinary people .
why should we expect that ?
but the truth is : if the rich and powerful are capable of hiding their fortune in tax ha@@ v@@ ens and not paying all their taxes , this means less money for important public services such as healthcare , education , roads .
and this concerns us all .
for my organization , Global Wit@@ ness , these revelations are phenom@@ enal .
all over the world media and leading politicians are discussing how secret tax ha@@ v@@ ens are used by a few few to hide and obsc@@ ure their wealth -- something that we have been discussing and revealing for ten years .
I think many people find this whole world very conf@@ using , and it is hard to understand how these tax ha@@ v@@ ens operate .
I always imagine it like a Mat@@ r@@ jo@@ sch@@ kap@@ u@@ ppe .
so you have a company in another company , in another company , which makes it almost impossible to really understand who is behind these signs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it can be very difficult for law enforcement and tax authorities , as well as for journalists or civil society to really understand what matters . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I think it &apos;s also interesting that there are less reports on this matter in the US .
probably because there have so far been no prominent Americans who were present in these revelations , this sc@@ andal .
now it &apos;s not that there are no rich Americans hiding their fortune in tax ha@@ v@@ ens .
however , by the principle that these tax ha@@ v@@ ens operate , Mos@@ sack Fon@@ sec@@ a has fewer American customers .
if we had a data leak from the Cay@@ man Islands or even from Del@@ aware , Wy@@ oming or Nevada , we would see much more cases and examples that have connections to the USA .
in fact , some US states require less information , less information is required to start a company than to get a library card .
this kind of in@@ transparency in the USA allowed employees of school districts to rip children off .
it has allowed frau@@ d@@ sters to rip off particularly suscep@@ tible investors .
it is this kind of behavior that affects everyone .
here at Global Wit@@ ness we wanted to find out how all this looks like in practice .
how does it work ?
so we sent a concealed investig@@ ator to the offices of 13 attor@@ neys in Manhattan .
our investig@@ ator was an African minister who wanted to bring suspi@@ cious money to the US to buy a house , a yacht , a private jet .
we really shocked us that all except one lawyer made suggestions for our investig@@ ator how he could transfer his money .
none of these lawyers joined us as clients , and of course nobody was given money to anyone , but it shows the problem with this system .
it is also important not to consider this as individual cases .
it is not about a single lawyer who has submitted suggestions to our cover@@ t investig@@ ator .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is not about a single top politi@@ cian involved in sc@@ andal . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is about how the system works through corruption , tax ev@@ asion , poverty and inst@@ ability .
and to cope with this , we have to change the rules of the game .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need to change the rules to make this type of behavior more difficult . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it may sound very clou@@ dy as if we could not do anything about it ; as if nothing had ever changed , as if there will always be the rich and powerful .
but as a born optim@@ ist I see that a lot has started to change .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the last few years we have seen more transparency regarding the owners of companies . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the topic found political attention by British Prime Minister David Cameron on the G@@ 8 summit in 2013 in Northern Ireland .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since then , the EU has entered into central registers at national level , who is really behind companies in Europe and who controls it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
one of the unpleasant facts is that the US is lag@@ ging behind .
representatives of both parties submitted a draft bill in both parliamentary chambers , but this does not make the progress we would like to see .
we would really like to see how this Panama @-@ Dis@@ closure , this huge insight into the world of tax ha@@ v@@ ens , is used as a means to ensure greater transparency in the US and globally .
for us , Global Wit@@ ness , this is a moment of change .
we need ordinary people who get angry when they see how other people can hide their true identity behind bog@@ us firms .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need leaders in the economy to get up and say : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; In@@ transparency is not good for business . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need leading politicians who recognize the problem and use laws to end this kind of in@@ transparency . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; together we can finally end the transparency that is now allowed to end this kind of tax ev@@ asion , corruption and money la@@ under@@ ing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is the story that I almost kidn@@ apped and landed in the trunk of a Red Maz@@ das .
one day after finishing my design studies , I made a sale at the farm .
a guy in the Red Maz@@ da stopped and looked at my bel@@ ong@@ ings .
he bought one of my works of art .
he was alone in the city and just made a road trip across the country . then he would go to the cor@@ ps of peace .
I invited him to a beer . he told me about how he wanted to change the world .
it became late . I became tired .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; while we paid the bill , I made the mistake asking him : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; where do you sleep tonight ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he made the whole thing worse : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know yet . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and I thought , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Oh , man ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
what do I do now ? &quot;
who does not know the situation ?
do I have to offer a sleeping place now ?
but I just got to know him ! he says he would go to the cor@@ ps of peace , but I don &apos;t know if he really plans it . I don &apos;t want to land in the trunk of a Maz@@ das !
this is a small boot !
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; then I heard me say : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have an air mattress . you can sleep in my living room . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a voice in my head said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ah , how do you please ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at night I lay in bed , I gaz@@ ed at the ceiling and thought , &quot; Oh man ! what have I collap@@ sed there ?
a wild stranger is sleeping in my living room .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what if he &apos;s crazy ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I got such fear that I got out of bed , sli@@ pping on to@@ e peaks to the door , and shut down my bedroom door .
but he was not crazy at all .
we are still in contact .
the work of art that he had bought from me today is hanging in his classroom . he is now a teacher .
this was my first experience as a host . it has changed my point of view completely .
perhaps the people who were sold to me as strangers in childhood , actually friends who were only waiting to be discovered ?
to house people on my air mattress was normal for me . when I moved to San Francisco , I took the air mattress .
let &apos;s take a time jump , two years later ...
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am unemployed , almost broke , my ro@@ omm@@ ate is moving and the rent is increased . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I learned that at that time there was a design conference in the city . all hotels were fully booked .
I think creativity can create fear into fun .
I wrote to my best friend and new ro@@ omm@@ ate Brian Ch@@ es@@ ky : &quot; Brian , I thought about how we could earn something . our apartment will stay at a designer bed and breakfast . young designers can stay with us , Wi @-@ Fi and a desk included , with a mattress and every morning breakfast .
ha ! &quot;
we created a website and set up so @-@ called &quot; air mattress and breakfast &quot; &#91; A@@ IR@@ B and Breakfast = Air@@ b@@ n@@ b &#93; .
three happy guests were allowed to sleep with us for 20 dollars on the air mattress on wooden floor .
they loved it , and we too .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m sure our cheese @-@ ham @-@ om@@ el@@ et ta@@ sted completely different because we made them for our guests . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we tou@@ red with them through the whole city . when we passed our last guest and the door fell into the castle , Brian and I star@@ ed at us .
had we just discovered that we were able to find new friends at the same time and pay our rent ?
things came rolling .
my former ro@@ omm@@ ate , N@@ ate Ble@@ char@@ czy@@ k , joined us as a developer .
we wanted to find out if we could make a business concept out of it .
so we presented to the investors : &quot; we want to create a website where people publicly post pictures of their private rooms , their bedrooms , their bathrooms -- the kind of rooms whose doors are closed when visiting .
over the internet , they can invite strangers to stay with them .
that will be the next big thing ! &quot;
we were waiting for the rocket to ign@@ ite .
but they did not .
no one who is still in comfort would invest in a business that allows strangers to sleep in apartments of other people .
why ?
because as children we all learned that strangers are dangerous .
if you have a problem , you should look at the things you can do well . we could design .
at the Academy of Fine Arts we had learned that design is much more than just appearance and hap@@ tics -- it &apos;s the overall experience .
we had learned how to design objects , but now we wanted to create immense trust through design , between people who never met before .
can design make such a thing ?
is it possible to create trust with design ?
I would like to give you a sample of which degree of confidence we were aiming for .
it &apos;s a 30 @-@ second experiment . it will force you out of your comfort zone .
th@@ um@@ bs up when you are ready .
take your mobile phone into your hand .
now I would like you to unlock your mobile phone .
give your un@@ locked mobile phone to your left sitting neighbour .
this quiet flight of panic that you now feel -- -- is exactly what hosts feel when they open the door for the first time .
because the only thing that is more personal than your mobile is your home .
visitors can not only read your SMS , they see your bedroom , your kitchen , your toilet .
how does it feel to hold the un@@ locked mobile phone of a stranger in your hands ?
most of them feel the responsibility .
that &apos;s how most guests feel when they stay somewhere else .
only for this reason can our company exist .
just like that , who is actually Al Gor@@ es mobile ?
could you announce on Twitter that he was candidates for the Office of the President ?
you can return the cell phones now .
you have now experienced what kind of confidence we want to build up . I would like to tell you about some discoveries .
what if we had changed a small detail in this experiment ?
what if your neighbor had first introduced himself to his name ; if he had told , where does he come from , how his dog or his children are called ?
imagine you &apos;d have 150 assessments that all say : &quot; he can really capture very well @-@ locked mobile phones ! &quot;
how would you feel if you had to leave your mobile phone ?
a well thought @-@ out feedback system decisi@@ vely strengthens trust .
in the beginning we made some things wrong .
it was difficult for people to submit negative jud@@ gements .
ultimately , we decided to wait until both hosts and guests left their assessments before we put them online .
last week we discovered something new .
we conducted a study with Stan@@ ford . we examined how prob@@ able it is that people trust each other , depending on how much they are in terms of age and place of residence .
we trust the people most who are most similar to us .
the more differences we find , the less we trust .
this is a natural social bias .
it will be exciting when you add a person &apos;s call -- in our case by assessments .
if you have less than three assessments , nothing changes .
but if you have more than ten , everything changes .
a good reputation touches common ground .
the right design can help us to overcome some of our deep @-@ rooted preferences .
we also learned that trust is dependent on how much one deals with .
here you see the reactions to the first message of a guest .
if you say too little , such as &quot; Hi ! , &quot; you will not get an answer .
tell too much , for example : &quot; I have problems with my mother , &quot; -- -- the request is not accepted .
so there is an optimal degree of openness , such as &quot; great works of art in your home ! I am making holidays with my family . &quot;
how can we create it with design to create this degree of openness ?
we use the size of the text field to recommend the right amount of text . we also give tips on which topics to write something .
our entire company builds on the hope that the right design can help overcome our prejudi@@ ces against strangers .
what we did not expect was the great amount of people who were more than willing to lay down those prejudi@@ ces .
here you see how many people claim our offer .
you can see three things .
first : unbeliev@@ ably good luck .
second , the ti@@ rel@@ ess work of our team .
third : a need not covered before .
business is very good for us .
of course there are times when not everything runs smoothly .
there were guests who have not allowed parties to celebrate or devast@@ ate apartments .
hosts have allowed guests to stand in the rain .
at the beginning of the project I worked with the customer service . all calls came directly to my mobile phone .
I stood at the front when trust was broken .
there is nothing worse than these calls . it hur@@ ts when I just think about it .
the disappointment that one hears in the voice of the call@@ ers was and will always be our greatest motivation to further improve us .
fortunately , only a fraction of the 123 million overnight stays had a problem .
for people rightly trusted each other .
when trust works , wonderful things can arise .
one of our guests made holidays in Uruguay . there he suffered a heart attack .
his host drove him to the hospital .
he even donated blood to the necessary operation !
here is his assessment :
&quot; perfect home for travelers who tend to heart attacks due to sitting activities .
the area is beautiful and equipped with sufficient hospitals .
J@@ avier and Ale@@ j@@ andra are real guar@@ dian angels that save lives , even though they don &apos;t know one at all .
you drive in your own car to the hospital , if you die and wait while you get a b@@ ypass .
because they don &apos;t want you to feel lonely , they pass books .
they can stay longer without charging the extra nights .
I can only recommend it ! &quot;
of course , not every stay runs out of course .
but these relations behind the pure money transaction are exactly what you want to achieve with the Share economy .
when I first stum@@ bled upon this term , I asked myself :
how does the thought of sharing fit together with money transactions ?
it is a matter of economic trade here .
but it is not just the &quot; rental industry &quot; to name it now .
share Economy describes a trade that promises human relationships .
people leave a part of themselves open , and that changes everything .
when you travel today , you can compare it with fast food . it is efficient and reliable , but less authentic .
but what if travelling would be a rich buffet of local impressions ?
what if in any place that one visits , a group of Ans@@ da@@ isi@@ ans would wait to fill a thoroughly and show one at a pub @-@ tour district from which one has never heard before ;
or if you could learn cooking from a five @-@ star cook ?
nowadays homes are designed according to the principle of privacy .
what if we would create apartments from the ground up to the other ?
what would that look like ?
what if cities would take the thought of shared participation ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I imagine cities that allow us society and relationships instead of lon@@ el@@ iness and isolation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in South Korea &apos;s capital Seoul , this project has already begun . many parking spaces owned by the government ,
were now offered residents . students who were looking for a place to stay ,
were im@@ par@@ ted to people whose children were withdrawn . incub@@ ators programs were launched ,
in order to be able to finance new start @-@ ups in the Share economy . over our platform alone , 7@@ 85@@ ,000 people in 191 countries will be guest at a foreign or even host in 191 countries .
so the idea does not seem to be as crazy as it was taught to us .
we didn &apos;t re@@ inv@@ ent the wheel .
hospitality was already there before .
there were similar websites in front of us .
so why exactly did our work ?
apart from luck and timing , we realized that you can find the right design with the components of trust .
design can help us overcome deep @-@ rooted prejudi@@ ces .
I find it start@@ ling ,
down@@ right stunning .
I have to think about it every time a red Maz@@ da goes past me .
we know , of course , that design cannot solve any problem .
but if it could help us if it had this great influence , I wonder what we can use in the near future .
thank you .
what do you think if you look at me ?
a beli@@ ever ? an expert ?
maybe even a sister .
or oppressed , bra@@ in@@ washed , a terrorist ?
or just a delay in the check @-@ up at the airport .
this is indeed true .
I do not give you the blame for your negative impressions .
so the media are people who look like me .
one study found that 80 % of reporting on Islam and Muslims is negative .
studies show that the Americans think that most would not know Muslims .
probably people don &apos;t talk to their U@@ ber drivers .
for those who have never met a Muslim yet : it &apos;s great to get to know you .
I tell you who I am .
I am a mother , a coffee maker -- double es@@ presso , with cream extra .
I am intro@@ ver@@ ted ,
a Mö@@ cht@@ eg@@ ern @-@ Fitness @-@ Fan@@ ati@@ cian ,
and I am a practicing , spiritual Muslim .
but not as Lady G@@ aga sings , because , baby , I was not born this way .
I decided to do so .
when I was 17 I decided to ou@@ ten myself .
no , not as a hom@@ os@@ exual person , like some of my friends , but as a Muslim . I decided to carry the Hi@@ j@@ ab , my head covering .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my feminist friends were horri@@ fied : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why do you supp@@ ress yourself ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the funny thing was : at that time it was a declaration of femin@@ ism for me , compared to the pressure that I felt as a 17 @-@ year @-@ old to adapt myself to a perfect and un@@ at@@ tain@@ able beauty ideal .
I have not only passed the faith of my parents .
I have w@@ rest@@ led with the Qur &apos;@@ an .
I read it , thought , posed in question , doub@@ ted and ultimately believed .
my relationship with God was not love at first sight .
it was trust and slow devotion , which deep@@ ened with every reading of the Qur &apos;@@ an .
the beauty of rhythm sometimes makes me cry .
I recognize myself in it . I feel God knows me .
have you ever had the feeling that someone perc@@ ei@@ ves you , understands you completely , and yet loves it somehow ?
that &apos;s how it feels .
later , I married and began , like all the good Egyptians , my career as an engineer .
later , after my marriage , I had a child , and basically lived the &quot; Egyptian @-@ American Dream . &quot;
then came that aw@@ ful morning in September 2001 .
many of you probably remember exactly where they were there .
I sat in my kitchen , had breakfast , looked at the screen and saw the word &quot; Break@@ ing . &quot;
there was smoke , air@@ planes flew into buildings , people j@@ umped out of the buildings .
what was that ?
an accident ?
a technical fault ?
my shock became quickly transformed into rebellion .
why should I do something like that ?
I changed the television channel and heard : ... &quot; Muslim terrorists ... &quot; ... &quot; In the name of Islam , &quot; ... &quot; Middle Eastern descent ... &quot; &quot; ... ji@@ had ... &quot; ... &quot; bom@@ bed Mec@@ ca ! &quot;
Oh my God .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is not only my country being attacked , but in the N@@ u the acts of others turned me into a susp@@ ects . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the same day , we had to go through the Mid@@ west of the United States to move to a new town and start the post@@ graduate studies .
I remember how I heard -- when we were silent -- so deep it went into my seat and I was the first time I was afraid to be recognized as a Muslim .
we moved into our apartment this night , in a new city where it felt like a completely different world .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and then I heard and read the warnings of the national Islamic organisations saying , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Be vig@@ il@@ ant , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ble@@ ed in well lit areas , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; don &apos;t be sam@@ pled . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I stayed in the whole week inside .
then it was Friday during that week -- the day Muslims gathered for prayer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and again the warnings were : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; don &apos;t go on this first Friday , the mos@@ que could be a goal . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I looked at the extensive coverage .
the feelings were understand@@ ably un@@ filtered and I also heard from attacks on Muslims or people that were held for Muslims .
there were really burn hits on mos@@ ques .
I thought : we should stay at home .
but something did not feel right .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because the people who attacked this country attacked our country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I got the anger of the people on the terrorists .
imagine ! I was also angry .
it is not easy to constantly explain yourself .
I don &apos;t have any questions , I love issues .
it is the accus@@ ations that are hard .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today we can actually say people : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is a problem in this country -- it is Muslims . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
when will we go ? &quot;
some people want to ban@@ ish Muslims and close mus@@ ques .
they speak of my church like a tumor in the US body .
only the question arises : are we malign@@ ant or ben@@ ign ?
you know : a malign@@ ant tumour is removed as a whole and a ben@@ ign tumor is only observed under observation .
the alternatives are point@@ less because the question is wrong .
like all other Americans , Muslims are not a tumour in the US body , but a vital organ .
thank you !
Muslims are invent@@ ors and teachers , first resp@@ onder@@ s and Olympic champi@@ ons .
will mos@@ ques make America more secure ?
maybe a few parking spaces will be released , but not stopping the terror .
the regular visit of a mos@@ que makes it possible for people to look more toler@@ ant of other beliefs and to show greater civi@@ c participation .
and as a leader of the police in the Washington , DC area recently told me : people are actually not radic@@ alised in mos@@ ques .
they are radic@@ alised in their basement or in bed in front of a computer .
in the process of radic@@ alisation one has found that it begins online . first , the person is cut off from their church , even from their family so that the extrem@@ ist group believes that the terrorists are the true Muslims , and everyone who ab@@ h@@ ors their behavior and their ideology is a tra@@ itor or dis@@ liked by faith .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if we want to prevent radic@@ alisation , we must stop people going to the mos@@ que . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
some will still claim that Islam is a violent religion .
finally , a group like the IS lays down its brut@@ ality with the Koran .
as Muslims , as a mother , as a human , I believe that we have to do everything to stop a group like the IS .
but we would add to their imagination if one recognizes them as representatives of 1.6 billion believers .
thank you !
the IS has so much to do with Islam , as the K@@ u @-@ Klu@@ x cl@@ one with Christianity .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; both groups claim their ideology on their &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Holy Book &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but when you look at them , they do not drive what they read in their &quot; Holy Scriptures . &quot;
it is her brut@@ ality that she can read these things into the scriptures .
an outstanding ima@@ m recently told me an amazing story :
a girl came to him because she pre@@ tended to join the IS .
I was really surprised and asked him if she had been in contact with radical religious leaders .
he said the problem was just the opposite . every minister with whom she had spoken brought her to silence and told her that her anger , her sense of injustice in the world , would only bring her into trouble .
inspired by nothing and something that would make sense to her anger , she was a main objective for the instrument@@ alization through extre@@ mi@@ sts who promised her a solution .
this ima@@ m restored the connection with God and their church .
instead of acc@@ using them for their anger , he showed their constructive ways for a real change in the world .
what she learned in the mos@@ que kept her from joining the IS .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was an insight of how Islam@@ opho@@ bia affects me and my family . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but how does it affect normal Americans ?
how does it affect everyone else ?
how does the 24 @-@ hour consumption of fear affect our democracy every day , on our freedom of thought ?
one study -- actually several neuro@@ scientific studies -- show : if we fear , at least three things happen .
we rather accept an author@@ itarian system of government , conformity , and prejudi@@ ce .
one study shows that if test persons were reporting news in which negative was reported by Muslims , they were rather military attacks on Muslim countries and the circumcision of the rights of American Muslims .
this is not just an academic problem .
if you look at when the mood sw@@ ings up against Muslims -- between 2001 and 2013 -- then this happened three times , but never in connection with terrorist attacks .
it happened in the run @-@ up to the Iraq war and during two election periods .
so Islam@@ opho@@ bia is not simply the natural reaction to Muslim terror as I expected .
it can actually be a tool for manipul@@ ating the public to under@@ mine the foundations of a free society , which has reasonable and well informed citizens .
dealing with Muslims is an early warning sign .
we may feel it first , but the toxic air of fear hur@@ ts us all .
in as@@ signing collective debt , it is not just about having to explain themselves .
De@@ ah and his wife Y@@ us@@ or were a young married couple living in Chapel Hill , North Carolina , where they both went to school .
De@@ ah was a sports@@ man .
he was talented , talented , promising ...
his sister would tell me that he was the sweet@@ est , most generous person she knew .
she visited him there and he showed her his CV . she was amazed and said :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when was such an accomplished young man out of my brother ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
just a few weeks after the visit of Su@@ z@@ anne for her brother and his wife , her neighbor , Cra@@ ig Stephen Hi@@ cks , murdered her , just like the sister of Y@@ us@@ or , Raz@@ an who visited her in the afternoon .
he shot at De@@ ah eight times .
fan@@ ati@@ cism can be not only im@@ moral , but also deadly .
so back to the beginning .
what happened after 9 / 11 ?
did we go to the mos@@ que or did we stay safe at home ?
we discussed it and for us it was not an easy decision , because it was about which America we would like to leave to our children : one thing that would control us through fear , or one in which we can exercise our religion freely .
we decided for the mos@@ que .
with our son in the child seat we drove sil@@ ently , with high pressure to the mos@@ que .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I took it out , pulled out my shoes , went to the prayer hall , and what I saw allowed me to stop . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the hall was completely filled .
then the Ima@@ m made an announcement , thank@@ ed and welcomed our guests , because half of the assembled were Christians , Jews , Budd@@ hi@@ sts , a@@ thei@@ sts , believers and non @-@ believers who came not to attack us , but to assist us .
at this moment I collap@@ sed .
these people were there because they had brought courage and compassion to panic and prejudi@@ ce .
what will you choose ?
what will you choose in the moment of fear and fan@@ ati@@ cism ?
are you going to be safe ?
or join those who think : we are better than those .
thank you very much .
thank you very much !
Hel@@ en Wal@@ ters : so D@@ alia , you seem to have hit a nerve .
but I wonder what you say to those who may claim that you are holding a TE@@ D@@ Talk , a ment@@ or with a drau@@ ght , working in a noble mind factory , thus an exception and not a rule .
what would you say to those people ?
D@@ alia Mo@@ g@@ ah@@ ed : I would say , don &apos;t be fool@@ ed . I &apos;m completely normal .
I am not an exception .
my story is not unusual .
I am as usual as allowed .
when you look at Muslims around the world , and I did that with the largest ever conducted study on Muslims around the world , people want normal things .
they want prosperity for the family , they want work and they want to live in peace .
so I am in no way an exception .
if people like an exception usually appear , then often the rule has been broken , and they are not the exception to the rule .
H@@ W : thank you . D@@ alia Mo@@ g@@ ah@@ ed .
what began as a platform for hob@@ by@@ ists is about to become a billion dollar business .
control , environmental monitoring , photography , film and journ@@ alism : these are some of the possible applications for commercial dr@@ ones . this is made possible in research institutions worldwide .
before air par@@ c@@ itation penet@@ rated our social consciousness , an autonomous fleet of flying machines at the Fra@@ c Centre in France built a six @-@ metre high tower of 1,@@ 500 bricks in front of the audience . some years ago , they began to fly with ropes .
by connecting flights , flying devices achieve high speed and acceleration in the tigh@@ test of spaces .
you can also build up load @-@ bearing structures .
they have learned to wear loads , deal with turbul@@ ence and generally respond to laws of nature .
today we would like to show you some of our new projects .
our goal is to exceed the limits of the possible in the autonomous flight .
in order for a system to work autonom@@ ously , it is necessary to know coll@@ ectively where the mobile objects are located in the room .
in our laboratory at ETH Zurich we often use external cameras to find objects , which enables us to focus on the rapid development of dynamic tasks .
for today &apos;s demo@@ s we use a new loc@@ alization technology from Ver@@ ity Studios , a publisher of our laboratories .
there are no external cameras .
each flying machine has internal sensors to determine the position in the room , determine the calculations on board what the machine should do .
there are external commands at the highest level . for example , &quot; start &quot; and &quot; land . &quot;
this is a so @-@ called stern starter ,
an aircraft that tries to beat two flies with a flap .
like other star@@ ters , it is efficient in forward flight , much more efficient than helicop@@ ters in all their variations .
in contrast to most star@@ ters , it can ho@@ ver , and has great benefits at start and landing , and is very versatile .
however , there is always a down@@ side .
a limitation of rear @-@ star@@ ters is that they react sensi@@ tively to turbul@@ ences such as wind gu@@ sts .
we develop new controls and algorithms to improve this .
the idea behind this is that the aircraft no matter what position the optimal position can be recovered and the performance can be improved by practicing .
okay .
during our research , we often ask ourselves fundamental abstract questions which advance at the heart of the matter .
such a question would be : what is the smallest possible number of moving parts for controlled flights ?
there are practical reasons for wanting to know the answer to such a question .
helicop@@ ters are known for example as machines with a thousand mobile parts that meet to hurt you .
decades ago , skilled pilots were able to fly remotely controlled aircraft that had only two movable parts : one prop@@ eller and a stern ru@@ dder .
recently we discovered that flying is working with just one .
this is the Mon@@ osp@@ inner , the mechanically simple remote controlled flying machine . it was invented recently .
it has only a moving part , a prop@@ eller ,
no fl@@ aps , hing@@ es and cross@@ ru@@ sters , no further actuators or control surfaces , only one prop@@ eller .
although it is mechanical , very much happens in the inner life so that it can fly soli@@ dly and can move everywhere in the room .
nevertheless , it does not have the elegant algorithm of the stern @-@ star@@ ters . to get it to fly I have to throw it exactly right .
the probability of throwing it right when I look at them is small , so I show you a video that was filmed yesterday evening .
if the bu@@ z@@ inner is an exercise in indul@@ gence , this machine is here , the Omni@@ kop@@ ter with its eight prop@@ ellers , an exercise in abundance .
what to do with all this abundance ?
they see that it is only symmet@@ rical .
that is why he is ambi@@ valent in his alignment .
as a result , he receives the proper skill ,
moving in the room in all directions , no matter in which direction it is rot@@ ated or even as it rot@@ ates .
of course it is complex , mainly in the field of interactive rivers of the eight prop@@ ellers .
some things can be imagined in models , the rest is learned directly when flying .
let &apos;s look at this .
if flying machines are to be part of our everyday life , they must be extremely safe and reliable .
this machine consists of two separate two @-@ prop@@ eller aircraft .
this rot@@ ates clock@@ wise
and the other anti @-@ clock@@ wise .
when you build them together , they behave like a high @-@ performance quad@@ ro@@ cop@@ ter .
but if something goes wrong -- a motor or prop@@ eller falls off , the electronics or a battery -- the machine can continue flying even if restricted .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will demonstrate this by making half of our flying in@@ capable . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the last demonstration investig@@ ates synthetic s@@ war@@ ms .
the large number of autonomous , coordinated units allows a range of aesthetic expression .
we took commercially available micro @-@ Quad@@ cop@@ ters -- each single weighs less than one slice of bread -- and equip them with loc@@ alization technology and algorithms .
each unit knows where in the room it is and is self @-@ controlled . therefore , there is no upper limit .
hopefully these demonstrations motiv@@ ate you to think about new revolutionary ideas .
the particularly safe machine over there would like to be a flying lamp@@ shade on Broadway .
of course , it is difficult to predict the impact of this technology .
for guys like us , wages are in development and the act of creativity .
it serves as a reminder how wonderful and enchanting our universe is , and that it allows creative , wise creatures to form them in such spectacular fashion .
the fact that this technology has such massive commercial and economic potential is the icing on the cake .
thank you very much .
1.3 billion years ago two black holes cir@@ cl@@ ed each other in a very distant gal@@ axy , so they converted the mass of three suns to pure energy in a tenth of a second .
this short moment they lit more brigh@@ tly than all the stars together in all the gal@@ ax@@ ies of the entire universe known to us .
it was a very big b@@ ang .
but they did not set up their energy in the form of light --
we finally speak of black holes .
the whole energy was released into space @-@ time @-@ structure itself and the universe explo@@ ded in gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves .
let &apos;s arrange the events tempor@@ ally .
just 1.3 billion years ago , multi@@ pl@@ ying life on Earth was originated .
since then the earth has produced a lot : cor@@ als , fish , plants , din@@ osau@@ rs , humans and -- God stands at us -- even the internet .
about 25 years ago , a group of particularly brave -- Ra@@ i Weiss from MIT , Ki@@ p Thor@@ ne and Ron@@ ald Dre@@ ver from Cal@@ tech - decided to build a huge laser detector in order to search for gra@@ vit@@ ational waves , which arise about through col@@ li@@ ding black holes .
most of them thought they were crazy .
but enough people recognised them as crazy geni@@ uses , so that the US National Science Foundation financed their idea .
after decades of development , design , conception and extremely hard work they built the detector lig@@ o : the laser interfer@@ ometer gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ wave @-@ observ@@ atory .
in the following period , the precision of lig@@ o could be significantly increased , which greatly improved the recognition performance .
therefore it is called Advanced Lig@@ o .
at the beginning of September 2015 , Lig@@ o was launched for a final test run to clarify some minor , persistent problems .
on September 14 , 2015 , only a few days after the start @-@ up of the detector , the gra@@ vit@@ ational waves of the two col@@ li@@ ding black holes rush@@ ed through the earth .
they went through you and me
and also through the detector .
Scott Hu@@ gh@@ es : only two moments in my life were more emotional than this :
the Bir@@ th of my Dau@@ ghter
and the good@@ bye to my death @-@ sick father .
in fact , these were the fruits of my life .
all that I had worked for is no longer science fiction ! AA : this is my very good friend and colleague Scott Hu@@ gh@@ es , a theoretical physi@@ cist at MIT . he has been investigating gra@@ vit@@ ational waves of black holes and their signals from observ@@ atories such as Lig@@ o . what are gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves ?
a wave of gra@@ vit@@ ation is a sp@@ elling in the structure of space and time .
when passing the shaft , the space and its entire content are stretched in one direction and squee@@ zed into the other .
for illustr@@ ative tut@@ ors in courses on rel@@ ativity theory , teachers often perform a real alpine dance .
&quot; stretching and diving , stretching and du@@ sting . &quot;
the problem is that gra@@ vit@@ ational waves are extremely weak , even ridi@@ culous .
on September 14 , for example , each of us was stretched and squee@@ zed at the arrival of the waves . the el@@ ong@@ ation of an average man was 10 high -@@ 21 .
that means 20 zer@@ os after the comm@@ a , followed by a 1 . this is why the Lig@@ o employees declared ins@@ ane .
with a five kilometer long laser detector , and that &apos;s already absurd , this length would have to be measured on less than a thous@@ and@@ th of the radius of a nucle@@ us . that &apos;s gr@@ ot@@ esque .
at the end of his classic text about gra@@ vit@@ ation
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; described Ki@@ p Thor@@ ne , a co @-@ founder of Lig@@ os , hunting for the waves as follows : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the technical difficulties in building such detectors are enormous . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but physi@@ cists are in@@ ventive and with the support of the public will certainly overcome all obstacles . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Thor@@ ne published this 1973 , 42 years before his success .
back to Lig@@ o . Scott willingly claims that Lig@@ o is more an ear than an eye .
I want to explain what this means .
visible light has a wavel@@ ength that is much smaller than things around us : facial features , the size of your mobile phone .
this is quite practical , because in this way you can create a picture or a map of things by perc@@ ei@@ ving the light coming from multiple points around you .
with sounds , that &apos;s different .
audi@@ ble sounds have a wavel@@ ength of up to 15 meters .
that is why it is very difficult , actually impossible to produce a picture of things that are particularly important to you :
about your child &apos;s face .
instead , we listen to certain characteristics such as pitch and height , rhythm and volume to close the story behind it .
&quot; now Alice just talks . &quot;
&quot; and Bob breaks them down . &quot;
&quot; stupid Bob . &quot;
the same applies to gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves .
we cannot make simple pictures of objects in space with them .
but by paying attention to changes in the ampl@@ itude and frequency of the waves , we can listen to their stories .
at least for Lig@@ o the measured frequencies are in the audi@@ ble range .
so when we convert wave patterns into sound , we can literally hear the All literally speaking .
to listen to the gravity can tell us much about the collision of two black holes , with which my colleague Scott has been working for a very long time .
SH : two black , not rotating holes , chir@@ p simply : w@@ up@@ p !
turning the two bodies very quickly , you hear the same chir@@ ping with an additional key change . that sounds like the wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu
it is a kind of movement vocabulary , im@@ printed in the wa@@ ve@@ form .
AA : on September 14 , 2015 -- a date that I will never forget -- Lig@@ o heard the following : &#91; Sur@@ render &apos;s sound &#93; somebody who knows what to hear - hears this as a sound of -- SH : ... two black holes each with 30 @-@ fold solar mass , which revol@@ ve around as fast as the rods of your Mix@@ ers .
AA : think about what this means .
two black holes , one of the dens@@ est bodies in space , one with a mass of 29 suns , the other with a mass of 36 suns , circle one hundred times a second before col@@ li@@ ding .
imagine these forces .
fantastic .
and we know because we heard it .
in this there is the remaining meaning of Lig@@ o .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Lig@@ o p@@ aves a completely new way to explore the universe as it has never been possible before . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this way we can listen to the All and hear the In@@ visible .
we can &apos;t see much in space -- practically or basically -- .
a super@@ nov@@ a , for example . I would like to know why m@@ asser@@ ei@@ che stars explo@@ de in super @-@ nov@@ as .
they are very useful . we have learned a lot about it from them .
the exciting physical processes happen , however , in the nucle@@ us , which lies behind thousands of kilometers of iron , carbon and silicon .
we will never go through as they are op@@ aque .
gra@@ vit@@ ational waves penetrate iron as if it were transparent glass . the Big B@@ ang : I would like to explore the first minutes of the universe , but we will never see them , because the Big B@@ ang is obsc@@ ured by its own after@@ glow .
using gra@@ vit@@ ational waves it should be possible to look back to the beginning .
and the most important thing : I am optim@@ istic that in all things we have never seen , which we have never seen , and of which we have no idea . things that we only discover by listening .
in fact , Lig@@ o found things right in the first attempt we didn &apos;t expect .
my colleague at MIT , Matt Ev@@ ans , is an important member of the Lig@@ o project , says on this subject : me : the kind of stars that highlight black holes , such as Lig@@ o , are the din@@ osau@@ rs of the universe .
they are enormous , ancient bodies of prehistoric times . the black holes are the su@@ cking no@@ od@@ les for our archaeological work so to speak .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Lig@@ o gives us a completely different perspective on the events in space , the emergence of the stars and ultimately on how we emerged from this chaos . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
AA : the challenge now is to be as courageous as possible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thanks to Lig@@ o , we know how to build great metal detectors and listen to the noise and p@@ ine@@ ering of the cosmos . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we need ideas for new observ@@ atories - a completely new generation of observ@@ atories on Earth and in space .
for what could be more beautiful than listening to the Big B@@ ang ?
now is the time of big dreams .
do you dream with us ?
thank you .
some time ago I tried out an experiment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for one year I would say &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Yes ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; in front of which I was afraid . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
no matter if it made me nervous , brought me into uncomfortable situations , I forced myself to say &quot; yes . &quot;
did I want to speak in public ?
no , but yes !
did I want to be live on TV ?
no , but yes !
did I want to start playing ?
no , no , no , yes , yes , yes .
and a crazy thing happened : to do exactly what I was afraid of , removed my fear .
my fear of keeping speeches , my social anxiety -- blow , away .
the power of a word is impressive .
&quot; yes , &quot; my life has changed .
&quot; yes , &quot; changed me .
but there was a certain yes , which changed my life deeply , to an unexpected kind . it began with a question of my smallest ones .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have three incredible daughters , Har@@ per , Beck@@ ett and Emer@@ son . and Emer@@ son , the smallest , calls all &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; k@@ itt@@ ens &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for in@@ explic@@ able reasons . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
as if she were a wa@@ it@@ ress from the south .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; kit@@ ten , I need milk for my be@@ ak . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
she asked me whether I could play with her when I was on the go . and I said , &quot; Yes . &quot;
this yes was the beginning
a new attitude to life in my family . from then on , I swear to always play with them as soon as you ask me . no matter what I am doing or where I go , I always say yes -- every single time .
almost . I &apos;m not perfect , but I am very happy .
it has a magical effect on me , my children , to our family .
but it also has an amazing side effect : only recently did I fully understand that the &quot; Yes &quot; -@@ say to playing with my children saved my career .
I have a real dream job .
I am a writer . I think things are about to awaken you to life .
dream job .
no . no .
I am a Titan .
dream job .
I create television . I &apos;m producing television .
I make television , in great style .
in this TV season I am responsible for carrying out 70 hours of program into the world .
four TV programmes , 70 hours of television . three to four shows are simultaneously in production .
each shipment provides hundreds of jobs that did not exist before .
the budget for an episode of a TV station can be between three and six million dollars .
let us say five .
a new episode every nine days four shows , so every nine days 20 million dollars watching TV , four TV programs , 70 hours TV , three programs simultaneously in production , four , 16 episodes : sc@@ andal , 15 episodes : how To Get A@@ way With Mur@@ der , 10 episodes : the Cat@@ ch , 70 hours TV ,
350 million dollars for one season .
in America my television series are running one after the other on Thursday evening .
all over the world , my series run in 256 regions in 67 languages for 30 million viewers .
my brain is global , and 45 of these 70 TV hours are programmes that I have created myself and not only produced , so even on top of it . I have to find time , really quiet , creative time to gather my fans around the camp@@ fire and tell my stories .
four TV series , 70 hours of television , three , sometimes four , shows at the same time in production , 350 million dollars , bon@@ fires burning around the world .
do you know who else is doing ?
no one , therefore I am a Titan .
dream job .
I don &apos;t want to impress you with it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I say it because I know what you think when the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; author &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I tell you , that all of you who work so hard , whether you run a company , a country or a classroom , a business or a school room , take me seriously when I talk about work so you can understand that I &apos;m not just around the computer and f@@ anci@@ er , and it &apos;s true when I say : I understand that there is not a dream job for a dream job .
it is all a job , all work , all reality , all blood , all per@@ spir@@ ation -- no tears .
I work a lot , hard and I love it .
when I &apos;m deep@@ ened in my work , there is no other feeling .
my work always creates a country from nothing .
it is as if I put troops on , as I painted on a canvas .
as long as you get a high sound , deliver a marathon .
you feel like Be@@ y@@ on@@ c@@ é .
and all this at the same time .
I love to work .
it is creative , mechanical , ti@@ ring and in@@ toxic@@ ating , funny and disturbing , clin@@ ically and mat@@ ernal , cruel and reasonable . and the best of it is hum@@ ming .
there is such a change in me when the work is going well .
a hum@@ ming begins in my head , and it grows and grows , and hum@@ ming sounds like a busy road , I could always drive on it .
many people accept when I declare to them the sums that I am talking about writing that writing is giving me joy .
don &apos;t understand me wrong@@ ly , it does .
but hum@@ ming -- when I began to work and work and work , build , create and work with television production , I discovered this thing , this hum@@ ming , this energy . the hum@@ ming !
the sums are more than writing .
hum@@ ming is action and activity . hum@@ ming is a drug .
the hum@@ ming is music . the hum@@ ming is light and air .
the hum@@ ming is God &apos;s voice in my ear .
and if you have such a bu@@ zz , then you cannot strive differently from great@@ ness .
the feeling of not being able to be different than to strive for size , no matter what price .
this is called Sum@@ ma .
or maybe it means being a work@@ ah@@ olic .
perhaps it &apos;s called genius .
perhaps it is called ego .
maybe it &apos;s the fear of failure .
I don &apos;t know .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I only know that I am not made for failure , and I only know that I love the sums . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I just want to tell you that I am a Titan , and I know I don &apos;t want to question it .
to make it clear : the more I become , the more episodes , the more episodes , the more work there is , the more things are happening at the same time , the more I write history , the more expectations there are .
the more I work to be successful , the more I have to work .
and what did I say about work ?
I love work , isn &apos;t it ?
the land I created , the marathon , which I run , the army , the screen , the high sound , the hum@@ ming , the hum@@ ming , the hum@@ ming .
I like this hum@@ ming . I love the hum@@ ming .
I need the sum . I am the sum .
am I just that hum@@ ming ?
and then the h@@ um stopped .
re@@ worked , over@@ loaded , over@@ stressed , burned out .
the sums stopped .
now my three daughters are used to the truth that their mother is a single working title .
Har@@ per tells people : &quot; my m@@ um will not be there , but you can write to my n@@ anny . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and Emer@@ son says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; k@@ itt@@ ens , I want to go to Sh@@ on@@ da country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is the children of a Tit@@ ans .
they are baby @-@ Tit@@ ans .
they were 12 , 3 and 1 when the hum@@ ming ceased .
the hum@@ ming of the engine stopped .
I didn &apos;t love my work anymore .
the sums did not come back .
my bu@@ zz was broken .
I did the same things as always : the same Tit@@ anic work , 15 hours @-@ days , worked weekends , no regre@@ ts , nothing deleg@@ ate , a titanium does not sleep , does not give up , with whole heart , clear eyes , whatever .
but there was no bu@@ zz .
in me was silence .
four TV programs , 70 hours , three productions simultaneously , sometimes four .
four TV programmes , 70 hours , three productions simultaneously ...
I was the perfect Titan .
I was a pre @-@ show Titan ,
everything was grey , I just had no fun anymore .
and that was my life .
everything I did .
I was the hum@@ ming and hum@@ ming I was .
so what do you do if what you do , the work you love , suddenly f@@ aded away ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I know some may think , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; W@@ ail out , stupid author titanium . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but you know you do it , you do it , you do what you do , be a teacher , be a ban@@ ker , a mother , a painter , Bill Gates , one simply loves another and that gives you the hum@@ ming , when you know the hum@@ ming , when you know the hum@@ ming , who is you then ?
what are you ?
what am I ?
am I still a Titan ?
when the song of my heart stops , can I survive in silence ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and then my &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Southern States wa@@ it@@ ress &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; asks me a question . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mama , do you like to play ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and I want to say no , when two things become aware of me :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; first , I must say yes to all and secondly , it did not call me &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; k@@ itt@@ ens . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
she calls no one more &quot; k@@ itt@@ ens . &quot;
when did that happen ?
I hate it when I &apos;m Titan and my hum@@ ming mo@@ cks , and here everything changes in my own eyes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and so she says , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; M@@ om , do you like to play ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and I say , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Yes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is nothing special about it .
we play and their sisters stum@@ ble , we laugh a lot and I read quite dramatically from the book &quot; Every@@ body Po@@ ops . &quot;
nothing unusual .
but it is outstanding because my pain and panic , in lon@@ el@@ iness and lack of breathing , I can &apos;t do anything except to watch out .
I am focused .
I am silent .
the country I created , the marathon , which I run , the army , the screen , the high sound - they no longer exist .
all that exists are sti@@ cky fingers and moist kis@@ ses , delicate voices , wax cra@@ y@@ ons and the song in which it is released , or whatever the girl in &quot; The Ice Queen . &quot;
peace and simplicity are everywhere .
the air in this place is so tight that I can hardly breathe .
I can hardly believe that I breathe .
playing is the opposite of works .
and I am happy .
something in me dis@@ solves .
a mental door enters and an energy shake comes in .
and that doesn &apos;t happen immediately , but it happens , it happens .
I feel it .
the sums are coming back slowly .
no full volume , barely there , it &apos;s quiet , barely audi@@ ble , but it &apos;s there .
not the sums , but a hum@@ ming .
and now I feel like I know a magical mystery .
but let &apos;s stay with the thing .
it is love . that &apos;s all .
no magic . no secret . only love .
it is something we have forgotten .
the hum@@ ming , the hum@@ ming of the work , the titanium @-@ um , that is only the replacement .
if I ask you who you are , if I tell you who I am , when I describe programs and TV hours and how functional my brain is , then I forgot what the real sums are .
hum@@ ming is not a force and it is not labour @-@ specific .
it depends on the joy .
real sums are dependent on love .
the hum@@ ming is the current that comes from the jo@@ ie of life .
real sums are self @-@ confidence and peace .
real sums are ignor@@ ing the pressure of history , the tasks to be done , expectation and pressure .
real sums are simple and original .
the real hum@@ ming is God &apos;s voice in my ear , but perhaps God whis@@ pered to me the wrong words , for which God told me I am a Titan ?
it &apos;s just love .
we all need a bit more love , much more love .
as soon as my child wants to play with me , I will say yes .
I do this as a rule , so that I can free myself as a work@@ ah@@ olic from any guilt .
it is law , I have no choice . I have no choice if I want to hear the sums again .
I wish it would be so easy . I &apos;m not good in playing , I don &apos;t like it .
I don &apos;t like to play as much as they work .
the truth hur@@ ts ,
but I don &apos;t like playing it .
I always work because I love it .
I prefer working at the workplace than at home .
this admission is painful , for what kind of person would prefer to be a home ?
well , I .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hon@@ estly , I call myself &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Titan &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I have to have problems .
none of them is that I am too relaxed .
we ra@@ ve around in the garden , before and back , back and forth .
we make small dance parties ,
we sing and play ball .
we burst soap bubbles .
here I feel overwhel@@ m@@ ingly stiff , absent and confused .
I always take my mobile phone .
but it is o.@@ k .
my children show me how to live , and the sum of the universe fills me .
I play and play until I wonder : why did we ever stop playing ?
you can do it ! always say yes , if your child wants to play with you .
maybe you think me nai@@ ve , for a day@@ dre@@ amer .
you &apos;re right , but you can do it too !
you have time !
and do you know why ? they are not R@@ ih@@ anna or a Mu@@ pp@@ et show @-@ figure .
your child will find you less interesting than you think .
it is only 15 minutes .
my little ones want to play with me for a maximum of 15 minutes until they think they want to do something else .
it is wonderful 15 minutes , but just 15 minutes .
after 15 minutes a Mari@@ enk@@ ä@@ fer or bis@@ cuit replaces me .
and speak my teen@@ ie @-@ daughter for 15 minutes with me , I am mother of the year .
it &apos;s just 15 minutes , more need not .
everyone can spend 15 minutes on the track , even in a bad mood day !
15 minutes a piece !
no mobile phone , no laundry , no distra@@ ction .
the day is short : dinner , the children are ready to bed .
but 15 minutes are in it !
my children are my wellness oasis , my world . it does not have to be the children . it is important to feel the hum@@ ming of having a place for peace of mind .
it &apos;s not about playing with your own children . it &apos;s about joy ,
to &quot; play &quot; in general .
treat yourself to the 15 minutes !
find out what &apos;s good for you .
find out and keep it out .
I am not perfect in it . I will fail and I will be victorious . meet friends , read books , enjoy the day --
&quot; do you want to play ? &quot; briefly stands for everything I gave up when I got my first TV show when I was a Titan in the training when I wanted to sur@@ pass myself more and more .
15 minutes per piece , why not treat yourself for 15 minutes ?
what can be wrong ? nothing !
the sum came back in my spare time . the sum seems to return if I don &apos;t work .
working doesn &apos;t work without playing .
it takes time , but after a few months a door opens , the energy flows in and I find myself in my office again . I hear an unknown melody , it fills me and my soul .
I like the hum@@ ming , but I don &apos;t love it .
I don &apos;t need it .
I am not hum@@ ming , hum@@ ming is not me ... no more .
soap bubbles and sti@@ cky fingers , dinner with friends .
this is my sum .
the bu@@ zz of life .
the hum@@ ming of love .
the sum of the work is part of me , but just a part . and I am so grateful for that .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a snap that I &apos;m a Titan . I have never seen a Titan playing the journey to Jerusalem . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I said yes to less work and more games . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and still , I have everything under control . my brain is still working . my camp@@ fire is still burning .
the more I play , the happ@@ ier I and my children are .
the more I play , the more I feel as a good mother .
the more I play , the more clear my head is .
the more I play , the better I work .
the more I play , the more I hear the sums . the country I created , the troops , the can@@ v@@ ases , the high clay , the sums , the hum@@ ming , the other , the right hum@@ ming : the bu@@ zz@@ ing of life .
the more I feel this bu@@ zz , the more this unusual , consistent , naked and new attitude towards life makes me wide . less Titan -- more I !
the more I feel this sums , the more I know who I am .
I am a writer . I think things out , I &apos;ll stir you up to life .
this belongs to the job , which means living his dream .
this is the dream of this job ,
because a dream job should be a little dre@@ amy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I said &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Yes &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to less work and more games . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Tit@@ ans have no chance here .
&quot; do you want to play ? &quot;
thank you very much .
I am a neuro@@ surgeon .
like most of my colleagues , I have to do with human trage@@ dies every day .
I know how your life can change from one second to the other after a severe stroke or after a car accident .
for us neuro@@ sur@@ geons , it is very frustr@@ ating that the brain , unlike other body organs , has a very low capacity for self @-@ healing .
after a serious injury to the central nervous system , patients often have a permanent disability .
this is probably the reason why I became a functional neuro@@ surgeon .
what is a functional neuro@@ surgeon ?
a doctor trying to improve the nerve functions through various surgical measures .
they certainly have one of the most well @-@ known , the &quot; deep brain stimulation . &quot; an electrode is im@@ planted deep in the brain to influence the circuits of the neur@@ ons in such a way that the neuro@@ logical function improves .
it really is an amazing technology . it has improved the fate of patients suffering from Parkinson &apos;s disease , suffering from violent trem@@ bling and severe pain .
neuro@@ mod@@ ulation however does not mean ne@@ uro @-@ healing .
the dream of functional neuro@@ sur@@ geons is to restore the brain .
in my opinion , we approach this dream .
I would like to show you that we are very close to you .
with some help , the brain can help themselves .
history began 15 years ago .
at that time I was a senior physician and worked day and night in the emergency room .
often I supplied patients with skull @-@ brain trauma .
they must imagine that in skull @-@ brain trauma the brain sw@@ ells and the cran@@ ial pressure increases .
in order to save life , it is necessary to reduce the pressure of the skull .
sometimes you have to remove a part of s@@ wollen brain mass .
instead of throwing away the s@@ wollen brain mass , we decided to analyse the brain mass with Jean @-@ François Brun@@ et , one of my colleagues , a bi@@ ologist .
what do I mean by that ?
we wanted to let cells grow out of this tissue .
this is not an easy task .
being able to grow cells from a tissue is similar to very small children who are taken out of their families .
you have to find the right nutrition , temperature , humidity and the surroundings to thri@@ ve .
that &apos;s exactly what we had to do with these cells .
after many attempts Jean @-@ François managed to succeed .
he saw that under his micro@@ scope .
that was a big surprise for us .
why ?
it looked exactly like stem cell culture . with large green cells surrounded by small , un@@ ripe cells .
you may also know from biology that stem cells are im@@ mature cells that can turn into each cell type of the organism .
the adult brain has stem cells , but very few . they are hidden in deep , small ni@@ ches of the brain .
it is surprising to obtain this type of stem cells from the surface tissue of the brain mass in the operation .
we made another fascinating observation : normal stem cells are very active -- they share very quickly .
they never die , they are im@@ mortal .
but these cells were different .
they spread slowly and after a few weeks they even died .
so we saw a new , strange cell population , which looked like stem cells , but beha@@ ved differently .
we needed a long time to understand where they came from .
they originate from these cells .
these blue and red cells are called dou@@ bl@@ ec@@ or@@ tin @-@ positive cells .
we all have them in our brain .
they make up 4 % of our brain cells .
they play a very important role in our development .
in the stage of the fet@@ us they provide for the folding of the brain .
but why do they stay with us ?
we don &apos;t know that .
we believe that they participate in the healing of the brain , as we find them at higher concentrations close to brain injuries .
but this is not so certain .
one thing is clear , however -- we received our stem cells from these cells .
we are facing a potential cell source that allows brain healing .
we had to prove that .
so we decided to develop an experiment .
we wanted to take a piece of brain mass out of the non @-@ linguistic area and then cultivate the cells exactly as it did Jean @-@ François
and they then mark the color to be able to track them in the brain .
in the final step , we re @-@ imported them to the collection point of the same individual .
we call the aut@@ olog@@ ous transplan@@ t -- Aut@@ otran@@ splan@@ tation .
one of our first questions was : what happens if we re @-@ integrate these cells into normal brain tissue ? and what will happen if we re @-@ implant the same cells in damaged brain tissue ?
thanks to the help of Prof. Eric Rou@@ iller we were able to work with apes .
in the first scenario , we reim@@ ported the cells to a healthy brain , and we observed that after a few weeks they were completely disappeared as if they were taken back , they go back home . the room is already occupied , they are not needed , so they disappear .
in the second scenario we added an injury and reim@@ plant@@ ated exactly the same cells and now the cells remained intact -- they grew to mature neur@@ ons .
here you see what we could observe under the micro@@ scope .
these are the cells that have been re @-@ imported .
the evidence they show are these small points . these are the cells that we dy@@ ed in vitro , in culture .
of course we could not stop here .
do these cells also help a monkey to recover from a brain injury ?
so we trained monkeys with a manual dex@@ ter@@ ity task .
they had to take feed pellets from one tray .
they made it very good .
when they reached a stable level of dex@@ ter@@ ity , we injured in the motor cor@@ tex the manual motor area .
after that the monkeys were paraly@@ sed , they could no longer move their hand .
just as it would happen in humans , they spontaneously recovered to a certain degree , just like after a stroke .
the patients are paraly@@ sed and then they try to recover with the help of plastic brain mechanisms . they rec@@ u@@ per@@ ate to a certain degree , just like the monkey .
when we were certain that the monkey had reached his degree of spontaneous recovery , we im@@ planted his own cells .
on the left , they see the monkey , who spontaneously recovered .
it can provide about 40 % to 50 % of its original performance from the injury .
it is not as precise and not as fast .
now see when we re @-@ planted the cells : the same monkey , two months after the implantation .
I can tell you that these were also very exciting results for us .
since that time we have found a lot more about these cells .
we can freeze it and use it later .
we can use them in other neu@@ rop@@ ath@@ ological models , for example in Parkinson &apos;s disease .
but our dream is still to implant them in humans .
I really hope that I can soon show you how the human brain gives us the means to heal itself .
thank you very much .
Bruno Giussani : Jo@@ cel@@ y@@ ne , that &apos;s wonderful , I &apos;m sure that just now , several dozen people in the audience , perhaps even the majority , think : &quot; I know someone who can do that . &quot;
I definitely .
of course , the question is what the biggest obstacles are before you can start clinical studies on humans .
Jo@@ cel@@ y@@ ne Blo@@ ch : the biggest obstacles are the authorities . based on these great results , you have to fill out about two kilograms of papers and forms to go through this kind of studies .
BG : this is understandable , the brain is very delicate , etc .
J@@ B : yes , but it takes a long time , a lot of patience and an almost professional team .
BG : look into the future -- you have completed the research and tried to get permission to start clinical trials . if you continue to look into the future , how many years it will take until someone can come to hospital and this therapy will be available .
J@@ B : it &apos;s hard to say .
initially , it depends on the approval of the clinical trial .
will the authority allow us to start it soon ?
then you have to carry out this study with a small group of patients .
it takes a long time to choose the patients to perform treatments and evaluate whether it is useful to make this kind of treatment .
then you have to apply it to a multi@@ center study .
first , you really need to prove that it is useful before you can offer this treatment to anyone .
BG : and that it is safe , of course . J@@ B : of course .
BG : Jo@@ cel@@ y@@ ne , thank you for your visit to TED and that you told us about it .
BG : thank you very much .
democracy .
we in the West are making a big mistake to consider them as a matter of course .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we do not see democracy as the fragile plant it is in reality , but as an inventory of our society . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we tend to consider them as imm@@ utable don@@ or .
we believe that capitalism leads inevitably to democracy .
that is not true .
Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew from Singapore and his great im@@ it@@ ators in Beijing proved beyond doubt that it is quite possible to have a flour@@ ishing capitalism and impressive growth , while politics remains completely un@@ democratic .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in fact , democracy is wan@@ ing with us , in Europe . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the beginning of the year , when I represented Greece -- the newly elected Greek government -- was un@@ equi@@ vo@@ cally clear to me as finance minister in the Euro@@ group that the democratic process of our country -- our choices -- would not affect the austerity programs implemented in Greece .
at this moment I thought there might be no better justification for Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew or the Communist Party of China , or some of my rebel@@ li@@ ous friends who told me that democracy would be abol@@ ished if it would change anything .
at this point I would like to introduce you to an economic model for real democracy .
I ask you , together with me , to believe that Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew , the Communist Party of China and even the Euro@@ group lie in error , we could save the democracy , but that we need a genuine and def@@ en@@ sel@@ ess democracy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for without democracy our societies are mixed , our future is dark and our great new technologies are wasted . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the subject of waste I would like to point out an interesting contradiction which currently threat@@ ens our economies .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I call it the twin @-@ summit parad@@ ox . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a summit is known to you . you know and recognize it as the mountain of debt that casts its long shadow over the USA , Europe and the whole world .
we all know the mountain of debt ,
but few know his twin .
a mountain of unused cash that belongs to wealthy savers and corporations that are too afraid to invest in where it would be productive and income that could produce the debt mountain and produce all the things that humanity urgently needs , for example &quot; green &quot; energy .
I call them two numbers .
over the past three months , 3,@@ 4 tri@@ l@@ lion US dollars have been invested in the United States , England and the euro zone , in all the wealth producing goods , such as industrial plants , machinery , office buildings , schools , streets , tracks , equipment , and so on and so forth .
3,@@ 4 tri@@ l@@ lions of US dollars are sounding like a lot of money until they compare it with the 5.1 tri@@ l@@ lions of US dollars , which at the same time were lying around the same countries and our financial institutions , and absolutely nothing , except to infl@@ ate stock exchanges and raise real estate prices .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thus debt and un@@ productive capital form the twin peaks that are not compens@@ ating for the usual market mechanisms . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the result is stagn@@ ating wages , more than a quarter of the 25 @-@ 54 @-@ year @-@ olds in the US , Japan and Europe are unemployed , and consequently a low pan @-@ economic demand that advoc@@ ates the pes@@ si@@ mis@@ m of investors , which , like in an endless loop , advoc@@ ates the pes@@ si@@ mis@@ m of investors , in which they do not invest .
invol@@ un@@ tarily , the circumstances lead to the fact that O@@ edi@@ pus k@@ ills him .
this is my hair with capitalism --
its extremely wast@@ eful art@@ .@@ All non @-@ productive capital should be used to improve our lives , develop human talents and , in particular , finance all the technologies , &quot; green &quot; technologies that are decisive for the salvation of the earth .
is democracy the solution ?
but before we continue : what do we understand under democracy ?
Arist@@ ot@@ le defined democracy as the form of society in which the free and the poor control the government as a majority .
the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy naturally closed too many --
women , foreigners , and of course slaves .
but it would be a mistake to mi@@ tig@@ ate the significance of the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy on the basis of these exclu@@ sions .
the decisive factor in the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy was and is that it with@@ drew the working poor , and not only gave them the right to freedom of expression , but more important and decisive , which gave them the right to political co @-@ determination with equal voting in questions of the state che@@ ek .
the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy did not last long --
like a candle that g@@ lows very brigh@@ tly , it is quickly burnt out .
however , our liberal demo@@ cra@@ cies don &apos;t have their roots in ancient Athens ,
but in the Magn@@ a Cart@@ a , in the glorious revolution of 16@@ 88 , even in the American constitution .
while the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy focused on the free citizens and strengthened the working poor , our liberal democracy is based on the values of Magn@@ a Cart@@ a , which ultimately was a statute for rulers .
the liberal democracy only arose when a complete separation of politics and economy was possible and the democratic process was restricted to politics , while the economy -- i.e. the world of tru@@ sts -- became a more democratic zone .
in our present @-@ day demo@@ cra@@ cies , since the time when this separation of politics and economy began , a rel@@ ent@@ less struggle between the two is taking place , while the economy slowly emig@@ rated to politics and de@@ ma@@ yed it .
do you wonder why politicians are no longer the same ?
it is not a degeneration of their DNA .
it is because these days it can be in the government and still not in power , because the power of politics has mig@@ rated into the economy and the areas are separated .
I mentioned my hair with capitalism .
if you think about it , it is like a herd of car@@ ni@@ vor@@ es , which so sustain@@ ably decim@@ ated the animals from which they feed , decim@@ ated that they end up star@@ ving at the end .
it is similar to the economy that has so far can@@ ni@@ zed politics that it har@@ ms itself by the self @-@ created economic crisis itself . the power of corporations is growing , political goods are depreci@@ ated , the ine@@ quality increases , the overall economic demand falls and the managing directors of the corporations are too frigh@@ tened to invest the cash in their companies .
the more successful capitalism exp@@ els the &quot; demo@@ s &quot; &#91; the people &#93; out of democracy , the higher the twin peaks , and the greater the waste of human labour power and the wealth of humanity .
if that is true , it is obvious that we must re@@ unite politics and economy , and it would be better if the &quot; demo@@ s &quot; keeps control , as in ancient Athens , apart from the exclusion of slaves , women and foreigners .
by the way , this is not a new idea .
the Marxist left had this idea 100 years ago and it did not go very well .
the lesson from the de@@ bac@@ le of the Soviet Union should be that working poor can only regain a position as in ancient Athens without creating new ways of brut@@ ality and extravag@@ ance .
but there is one solution : abol@@ ishing the working poor !
capitalism does it by replacing low @-@ wage workers with automation and robots .
the problem is , as long as economy and politics are separate areas , automation makes the twin peaks become higher , the extravag@@ ance sub@@ lime , and social conflicts more deeply , just like it -- very soon , as I believe -- in countries like China will come .
so we must resh@@ ape the economy and re@@ unite the areas of economy and politics , and make sure that we are democr@@ ati@@ zing the re@@ unified area , otherwise we end up in a path@@ ological surveillance hyper@@ car that makes the film &quot; Matrix &quot; seem like a documentary .
the question is therefore not whether capitalism will survive the technical achievements it has brought forth --
the more interesting question is whether capitalism is replaced by a d@@ yst@@ op@@ ia , similar to the &quot; matrix , &quot; or by something similar to the society in &quot; Star Tre@@ k , &quot; in which machines serve people and people put their energy into the exploration of the universe , or into a high @-@ tech version of the ancient Ath@@ eni@@ ans &quot; A@@ gor@@ a , &quot; in long talks to indul@@ ge in the meaning of life .
I think we must be optim@@ istic .
so what would it take , how could it look like this &quot; Star Tre@@ k &quot; -@@ like utop@@ ia instead of the &quot; matrix &quot; -@@ like d@@ yst@@ op@@ ia ?
in the practical implementation I would like to give you some examples briefly .
in the company area : please introduce a capital market where you earn money while working and in which your capital follows you from one office to the next , from one company to the next , and the company -- no matter where you are working -- is the property of those who are currently working in the company .
then all income comes from capital and revenues and the concept of wage labour is completely obsol@@ ete .
no distinction is between those who belong to companies but they do not work in it , and employees who work there , but who do not belong to them . no more exchange between capital and labour , no big gaps between investment and savings , and ultimately no rising twin peaks .
in the field of global political economy , please briefly imagine that our national currencies would have a freely fluctu@@ ating exchange rate , in a universal , global , digital currency that is issued by the IMF &#91; International Monetary Fund &#93; , and the G @-@ 20 &#91; Group of the 20 largest Emerging Markets &#93; , in the interests of all of humanity .
imagine that the entire world trade is tra@@ ded in this currency -- let us call it &quot; the cosmos , &quot; in units of &quot; cosmos &quot; -- and every government pays the sum corresponding to the trade deficit or the trade surplus of the respective country into a common fund .
imagine that this fund inv@@ ests in green technologies , especially in parts of the world where investment funds are rare .
this is not a new idea .
it is basically what John May@@ n@@ ard Key@@ nes proposed at the Bret@@ ton W@@ oods Conference from 1944 .
the problem was that at that time it was not the technical means to implement it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today we have them , particularly against the backdrop of a re@@ unified policy and economy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the world I describe to you is at the same time liberal , in which it pre@@ fers privileged persons , and Marxist , because it will have buried the separation of capital and labour in the bin of history , and Key@@ nes@@ ian , global Key@@ nes@@ ian .
but above all , it is a world where we can imagine genuine democracy .
will we awaken in such a world
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or will we sink into a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; matrix &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - similar d@@ yst@@ op@@ ia ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the answer depends on how we decide together politically .
it is in our hands and we do it better democr@@ atically .
thank you .
Bruno Giussani : Yan@@ is ...
you describe yourself as liber@@ t@@ arian Marx@@ ists in your biography .
how relevant is Marx &apos;s analysis today ?
Yan@@ is Var@@ ou@@ fak@@ is : if any of what I just said is relevant , then Marx is relevant .
the reason for the re@@ unification of politics and economy is ... Do we not do that , technological development will produce such a massive decline in aggregate demand , which Lar@@ ry Sum@@ mers describes as &quot; long @-@ term stagn@@ ation . &quot;
by transferring this crisis from a part of the Earth to the next , as we are currently experiencing , it will not only dest@@ abili@@ ze our demo@@ cra@@ cies , but also the countries whose interests in liberal democracy are low .
if this analysis is true , then Marx is quite relevant ,
as Hay@@ ek , for this reason , I am a liberal Marxist , and like Key@@ nes , and that is why I am also perfect .
BG : indeed , and now we are well .
Y@@ V : if you &apos;re not whi@@ r@@ ling , you don &apos;t think enough .
BG : this is a very Greek , a kind of philosophical explanation -- Y@@ V : actually it was Einstein who said this . BG : in your talk you mentioned Singapore and China and yesterday at dinner of the speakers you have said very clearly what you think from the West &apos;s point of view in China .
would you like to repeat it here ?
Y@@ V : there is a great deal of hypo@@ cris@@ y .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in our liberal demo@@ cra@@ cies , we have the appearance of a democracy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
as I said in my speech , we have limited democracy to politics , in the area where most plays out -- the area of economy -- a completely democratic zone .
in a sense , if I may say so pro@@ voc@@ atively , China today resembles the England of the 19th century .
for -- remember -- we tend to combine liber@@ alism with democracy -- this is a mistake , historically regarded .
liber@@ alism , Liber@@ al , as John Stu@@ art Mill --
he was particularly scep@@ tical about democratic development .
what can be observed in China is very similar to the development we had in England during the industrial revolution , especially the transition from the first to the second .
to submit to China now to do what the West did in the 19th century itself sm@@ ells of hypo@@ cris@@ y .
BG : I am sure that many listeners are curious about their experiences as finance ministers of Greece at the beginning of the year .
Y@@ V : I guess that &apos;s coming .
BG : yes ...
how do you look back six months later to the first half of the year ?
Y@@ V : very exciting , from a personal point of view , and very dis@@ ap@@ pointing because we had the opportunity to make a new beginning with the euro zone ,
not only Greece , but the Eurozone ,
to say good@@ bye to us , and the permanent den@@ ial that a massive fault line passed through the euro@@ zone , and continues to massi@@ vely thre@@ aten the development of the whole European Union .
we had the opportunity , on the basis of the Greek proposal -- by the way , the first suggestion that revealed this den@@ ial --
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; unfortunately , the powers within the euro@@ zone , within the European group , have continued to choose den@@ ial . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but you know what &apos;s coming .
this is the experience of the Soviet Union --
if you try to maintain an economic system that is not viable to live by political will and author@@ it@@ ari@@ anism , you may be able to delay it for a while , but when the changes occur , it will happen ab@@ rup@@ tly and destructive .
BG : what changes do you fores@@ ee ?
Y@@ V : there is no doubt that the Eurozone has no future if we do not change its structure .
BG : did you make any mistakes in your time as finance minister ?
Y@@ V : every day .
BG : for example ? Y@@ V : anyone who looks back -- seri@@ ousness ...
if there is a minister of finance or any minister who , after 6 months in office , particularly in such a ten@@ se situation , claims he has made no mistake , then this is a dangerous person .
of course I made mistakes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the biggest mistake was to sign the application for extending the debt programme at the end of February . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I believed that there was an honest interest on the side of the don@@ ors to find a common solution .
but that didn &apos;t exist .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they merely wanted to bring our government down because they did not want to deal with the distor@@ tions running through the euro@@ zone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they did not want to admit that they had been going through a disa@@ strous program in Greece for 5 years .
we lost one third of our nominal GDP .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s worse than during the &quot; Great Depression &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nobody from the tro@@ ika of the credi@@ tors imposed on us this policy was : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was a col@@ os@@ sal mistake . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
BG : despite all this , and despite the aggressive sound of the talks , you seem to be quite pro @-@ European .
Y@@ V : absolutely .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my criticism of the European Union and the Eurozone is from someone who lives and loves Europe . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my biggest fear is that the euro@@ zone is not out@@ dated . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for if they do not survive , the liber@@ ated centri@@ fu@@ gal forces will demon@@ ic and destroy the European Union . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this will not be cat@@ astrop@@ hic for Europe alone , but for the entire global economy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we are probably the strongest economy in the world .
if we allow ourselves to embar@@ k on a post @-@ modern 1930 that appears to me , it will be as bear@@ able for the future of Europeans as well as non @-@ Europeans .
BG : we hope that you are wrong at this point .
Yan@@ is , thanks for having been with TED .
Y@@ V : thank you .
most of you have never heard Roy Price though , although he is probably responsible for 22 moderate minutes of your life on 19 April 2013 .
probably also for 22 very entertaining minutes , but not for very many of you .
that goes back to the decision that Roy met three years ago .
Roy Price is a senior employee at Amazon Studios ,
the TV production company from Amazon .
he is 47 years old , slim , has a hed@@ geho@@ g and describes himself on Twitter as &quot; Films , TV , Technology , Tac@@ os . &quot;
Roy has a very important job because he is responsible for selecting the shows and the content that Amazon will produce .
of course this is a very hard @-@ fought branch .
there are so many TV series that Roy can &apos;t choose any one .
he has to find shows that are very , very good .
in other words , he has to find shows that are on the right side of this corner .
this curve is the evaluation distribution of over 2500 TV series on the IM@@ DB website . the rating goes from 1 to 10 and the height shows how many shows get this rating .
if your show is valued at nine and above , this is a winner .
then you have a successful show .
these are shows like &quot; Break@@ ing Bad , &quot; &quot; Game of Thr@@ ones , &quot; &quot; The Wire &quot; -- all the shows that are addic@@ tive , where after you watched a season , your brain asks : &quot; where are there more of these episodes ? &quot;
this kind of show .
on the left , here at this end , shows like &quot; To@@ dd@@ lers and Ti@@ ar@@ as &quot; -- -- that should tell you enough what is going on at this end of the curve .
Roy Price doesn &apos;t worry about getting to the left side of the curve , because I think you need special intelligence to forbi@@ d &quot; To@@ dd@@ lers and Ti@@ ar@@ as . &quot;
he is more concerned about the average salary , the average television -- the shows that are neither good nor bad , they simply do not inspire .
so he must make sure he &apos;s really on the right side .
the pressure is present , and of course it &apos;s the first time Amazon does that , so Roy Price doesn &apos;t want to risk anything .
he wants to create success .
he needs guaranteed success , so he keeps a competition .
he takes on many ideas for TV shows and by evaluating eight candidates for TV shows , he produces the first episode of each of these shows and puts them online where everyone can watch them for free .
and if Amazon released stuff for nothing , you &apos;re attacking , right ?
millions of viewers watch these episodes .
however , they do not know that they are observed when watching these shows .
they are watched by Roy and his team who record everything .
you collect when you start the show , when you pause , which parts you skip or check again .
they collect millions of data to determine which show they should produce with these data .
in fact , they collect the data , process it and this results in the answer , and this is : &quot; Amazon should make a sit@@ com via four Republi@@ can US sen@@ ators . &quot;
they made this show .
does anybody know the name of this show ?
yes , &quot; Alpha House , &quot; but it seems that many aren &apos;t able to remember this show because it wasn &apos;t that good .
it &apos;s just an average show -- in the tru@@ est sense of the word -- because the average of this curve is 7.@@ 4 and Alpha House lands at 7.5 -- so somewhat above the average , but not exactly what Roy and his team worked .
about the same time at another company another manager has placed a top show through data analysis . his name is T@@ ed , T@@ ed Sar@@ and@@ os , the manager for program design of Net@@ fli@@ x . just like Roy , he is always looking to find them a super show and he also uses data for it , but he makes things different .
instead of hosting a competition , he and his team watched the existing data about the Net@@ fli@@ x viewer , so the reviews they give to the shows , their course , what shows they like etc .
then they use this data to find out these little details about the audience : what shows they like , which producers , what actors .
when they had all the parts together , they entered a venture and decided not to make a sit@@ com for four sen@@ ators , but a drama series about a Sen@@ ator .
do you know this show ?
yes , &quot; House of Cards . &quot; Net@@ fli@@ x has landed a hit , at least for the first two seasons .
&quot; house of Cards &quot; gets a 9.@@ 1 rating on this curve . so exactly where they wanted to go .
of course , the question is : what happened here ?
you have two very competitive , data sav@@ vy companies .
they connect these many data together and it works great for one of them , but not for the other company .
what is this ?
because logic somehow states that it should work with everything .
if you collect millions of data , for a decision you make , you should make a good decision .
you have 200 years of statistics as back @-@ up .
it optimi@@ zes it through very powerful computers .
the least thing you can expect is good TV , isn &apos;t it ?
if data analysis does not work in such a way , it is a bit sc@@ ary because we live in a time where we take more and more statistics to make serious decisions far beyond television .
does anyone know the company Multi @-@ Health Systems here ?
no one . OK , that &apos;s even good .
multi @-@ Health Systems is a software company and I hope nobody ever comes into contact with this software in this room . come into contact with it , you are in prison .
if someone is in prison in the US and asks for dis@@ miss@@ al , it is likely that the data analysis of this company is used to determine if a discharge occurs or not .
just like Amazon and Net@@ fli@@ x . but instead of deciding whether a show will be good or bad , it is decided whether a person will be good or bad .
moderate television , 22 minutes , that can be really bad , but even more years in prison are worse .
unfortunately , there is evidence that this data analysis , despite the many data ,
not always the best results are generated . this is not because a company like Multi @-@ Health Systems does not know how to use data .
the data of the most experienced companies is also wrong .
yes , even Google sometimes makes mistakes .
in 2009 , Google announced that data analysis out@@ breaks of flu , the worst way of predic@@ ting -- by data analysis of Google research .
it worked wonderfully and was a great news sensation . success cul@@ min@@ ated in a publication in the magazine &quot; Nature . &quot;
it worked flaw@@ lessly , year around year , until it didn &apos;t work anymore ,
and no one could say why .
it just didn &apos;t work , this was again a sensation , including the re@@ vocation of the publication in the magazine &quot; Nature . &quot;
even the data of experienced companies such as Amazon and Google sometimes mis@@ understand something .
despite all these errors , data flow visi@@ bly into decisions of life -- at work , in law enforcement , in medicine .
so we should rather make sure that data is helpful .
I also know many difficulties with data . I work in computer @-@ ai@@ ded genetics -- an area where some very smart people uni@@ mag@@ in@@ ably use many data to make serious decisions , as the decision for a cancer therapy
or the development of a drug . over the years I have recognized some patterns about the difference between successful decisions using data and not successful decisions . this pattern should be distributed .
if you ever have to solve a complex problem , do two things mainly :
first , dis@@ assemble this problem in its components so that you can analyze the individual parts ; as a second , put the individual parts together again to make a decision .
sometimes you have to do this several times , but there are always two things : take apart and put together again .
and now the most important thing : data and data analysis are only good for the first part .
data and data analysis , no matter how powerful , can only help to disman@@ tle a problem and understand its parts .
they are not suitable to assemble the parts again and then come to a decision .
there is another tool for this and we possess it all : our brain .
if there is something in which the brain is good , it is necessary to put parts and pieces together again , even if the information is incomplete , in order to make a good decision -- especially if it is the brain of an expert .
that is why I think Net@@ fli@@ x was so successful because they used data and minds where they belong also in the process .
they use data to better understand their audiences , which they would otherwise not have been able to do . but the decision on how to take all these parts together and make a show such as &quot; House of Cards &quot; does not stand in the data .
T@@ ed Sar@@ and@@ os and his team met this decision , which meant they had a great personal risk with this decision .
Amazon , on the other hand , did this in the wrong way .
they used data to control all their decisions first as they were competing for TV ideas , then when they chose &quot; Alpha House &quot; as a show .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was a safe decision because they could always say : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they tell us the data . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it did not lead to the desired result .
data are helpful for better decisions , but I believe things are going wrong when data start to control our decisions .
no matter how powerful they are , data is just a tool , and in order not to forget it , this device is quite useful .
many of you will ...
before there was data , this was the device for decisions .
many know it .
it &apos;s also called &quot; Magic 8 Ball . &quot; it &apos;s amazing . for decisions using a Ja@@ - or No question you just have to shake the ball to get an answer . &quot; most likely , &quot; right here at this moment .
I will do it later with a technical demo .
so far I have made some decisions in my life , and I should have heard in hind@@ sight of the ball .
but , as you know , of course , if you have the data available , you would like to replace it with much more sophisticated , such as data analysis to make better decisions .
but this does not change the basic structure .
so maybe the ball gets smar@@ ter and wis@@ er and wis@@ er . ultimately , it &apos;s up to us to make decisions if we want something extraordinary at the end of the right turn .
and I feel this as a very encouraging message that despite the huge amount of data , it still pays off to make decisions , to be an expert in what you are doing and taking risks .
in the end , it is not the data , but the risks with which you end up at the right end of the curve .
thank you very much .
