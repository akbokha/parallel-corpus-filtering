Munich 18@@ 56 : four maps that change your view of the city
an Ir@@ ren prison , where young people meet today .
a mine chapel , where now is dug for the underground tunnel .
farmers cultivate the former cause of farmers .
the oldest official card coin promotes exciting stories to days .
it is annoying when maps are not up @-@ to @-@ date .
everyone who had to get excited about it , because the car Nav@@ i showed a green meadow instead of a b@@ ypass road .
the historical maps of the digital Bayern At@@ las@@ es , an offer of the Bavarian State Government , are anything but up @-@ to @-@ date - but it is very informative .
especially if you compare them with current online cards .
then it becomes clear how cities and municipalities have changed in the spread @-@ area of the Munich Mer@@ cury since the 19th century .
the digital Bayern @-@ Atlas is a Fli@@ ck@@ ent@@ ep@@ p@@ I , which one recognizes as such .
the large overview map has been incorporated into more detailed maps for cities and municipalities , so @-@ called copy@@ rights .
these originated according to the Bay@@ er@@ isches sur@@ veying administration between 18@@ 10 and 18@@ 64 and originate from the first survey Bavaria .
your client : Napoleon .
the French military leader occupied Bavaria since the spring of 1800 during the Second Coalition War with Austria .
Napoleon wanted an overview of the occupied land and ordered Bay@@ erns top@@ ographical survey - of course for military purposes .
even if the French troops finally departed with the peace of Lun@@ é@@ ville of February 9 , 18@@ 01 , today &apos;s neighbors who created the idea of a nationwide Bavaria map .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; El@@ ector Max IV pushed forward the project , founded the &quot; Top@@ ographic Bureau &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - and thus the Bavarian sur@@ veying management . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the manuscript for Munich dates from the year 18@@ 56 and can be found on the website of the Bay@@ erische Landes@@ bibliothek .
the comparison Early / Today is the most impressive example of the state capital .
the city has expanded in all directions and has grown together .
an example of this is Unter@@ sen@@ d@@ ling , which appears relatively isolated in the map of 18@@ 56 .
S@@ end@@ ling was founded 21 years after the development of the map , i.e. in 18@@ 77 , as the Munich subur@@ b .
today , Unter@@ sen@@ d@@ ling is located in the middle of the city .
the houses of Unter@@ sen@@ d@@ lings are concentrated around 18@@ 56 along today &apos;s Pl@@ ing@@ an@@ ser@@ straße , which was named after Georg Sebastian Pl@@ ing@@ an@@ ser in 18@@ 78 , a leader of the uprising of the Bavarian peasants against Austria in 17@@ 05 .
where today the West@@ park is , one sees nothing as fields - at first glance : when zo@@ oming in , a smaller map with dozens of lines and numbers appears : hand@@ written numbered fl@@ utes from the so @-@ called &quot; primitive collection &quot; from which the basic tax was derived .
small plots are no longer evidence of farmers there , but rather small gar@@ den@@ ers of the &quot; land in sun . &quot;
a large green area is north of Unter@@ sen@@ d@@ ling .
the Ther@@ esi@@ en@@ wi@@ ese , since 18@@ 10 the scene of the October festival , was actually a meadow in the 19th century - and no concrete desert .
on the other side of Is@@ ar , the historical map provides an insight into the history of psychiat@@ ric medicine .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the document &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the air &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but also in large letters &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ir@@ ren Anst@@ alt &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the area of today &apos;s district Au @-@ Hai@@ d@@ hausen . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
yes , here at Au@@ er@@ feld@@ straße one once locked people with del@@ u@@ sions .
in 18@@ 58 / 59 the Munich district Ir@@ ren@@ anstalt &quot; On the Au@@ er Lü@@ ft@@ ments &quot; was created .
from 18@@ 72 , Dr. Bernhard von Gu@@ dden managed the establishment of this psychiat@@ rist , which is associated with the death of King Ludwig II .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he was progressive for his time and ended , for example , the accus@@ ation of the so @-@ called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ir@@ ren . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition , he prohibited the personnel to resort to violence against the occup@@ ants , &quot; says Hermann Wilhelm , director of the Hai@@ d@@ hausen Museum , who was engaged in an exhibition with the institution .
for 280 patients there was first place ; later it was extended to 500 places .
at some point this capacity was no longer sufficient - the reason for the construction of the gy@@ na@@ ecological facility in Haar@@ lem in 1905 .
since 2006 , the Is@@ ar Amp@@ er Klin@@ ik@@ um Munich @-@ Ost , one of Germany &apos;s largest psychiat@@ ri@@ sts , has been located there .
young people in the Munich @-@ based Sal@@ esi@@ an@@ um meet at the premises of the former Au@@ er Institute .
the Order acquired the building complex in 1920 and transformed him into a youth home with training facilities .
West is the football pitch of the TS@@ V München Ost , east of residential buildings from the 1980s .
in 2015 , the children &apos;s house &quot; Casa Don Bos@@ co &quot; was built in an architectural style reminiscent of the original building of the Ir@@ ren@@ anstalt , which was destroyed during the Second World War in bom@@ b@@ ings .
the Mari@@ en@@ platz was listed as &quot; main pl@@ aza &quot; in 18@@ 56 , the Kauf@@ inger street called &quot; Kauf@@ inger G@@ asse . &quot;
the Second World War also brought a decisive change in the heart of Munich .
in December 1944 the Al@@ lies bom@@ bed many holes in the city centre .
a big one remained until today - at the Mari@@ enhof .
the English Institute , small business houses and a chapel from the Middle Ages once stood at the Mari@@ enhof , where these days were prepar@@ atory work and on 5 April 2017 the ground @-@ breaking ceremony took place for the second S @-@ Bahn regular route .
with the sli@@ der , the old Munich map can be compared with today &apos;s aerial view - and fill the hole at the Mari@@ enhof .
civil Rights Group publishes travel warning for Mis@@ sour@@ i
the National Association for Pro@@ mot@@ ing Far@@ es has issued a warning for coloured people who travel to Mis@@ sour@@ i due to discrimin@@ atory policies and rac@@ ist attacks .
&quot; the NA@@ AC@@ P Travel Advisory for the state of Mis@@ sour@@ i , scheduled to enter into force by August 28 , 2017 , calls for African travelers , visitors and Mis@@ sour@@ i@@ ans to pay special attention while travelling through the state , as a number of question@@ able , racial @-@ based incidents occur in the entire state and be noted here , &quot; is stated in the Group &apos;s opinion .
a recently adopted bill of Mis@@ sour@@ i , which makes it harder for people to win discrimin@@ atory lam@@ entation , as well as the law enforcement agencies of the state , which dispro@@ portion@@ ately aimed at minorities , encouraged the group to issue the warning , said the NA@@ AC@@ P .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they have violations of civil rights that happen to people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they are stopped because of their skin colour , they are beaten or killed , &quot; said the President of the Mis@@ sour@@ i NA@@ AC@@ P , R@@ od Chapel , the K@@ ans@@ as City Star .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we hear complaints in such a frequency that we have not yet heard . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is the first such warning issued by the Organization for a State in the United States .
the group cited events such as rac@@ ist off@@ ences against black students at the University of Mis@@ sour@@ i and the death of T@@ ory S@@ anders , 28 , a black man from T@@ enn@@ es@@ see .
S@@ anders died under question@@ able circumstances at the beginning of the year after he had no petrol during the trip and was taken into custody by the Mis@@ sour@@ i police without being accused of a crime .
the Council also points out a recent report from the Mis@@ sour@@ i Office of the Mis@@ sour@@ i Office , which shows that black drivers in the state are 75 percent more common than wh@@ ites .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the recommendation is that people are aware and inform their families , friends and staff about what could happen in Mis@@ sour@@ i , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Chapel . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; people must be willing to bring ch@@ ewing money or let their relatives know that they travel through the state . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mis@@ sour@@ i recorded 100 hate crimes in 2015 , according to the latest figures from the Hass@@ an Cri@@ mes Report program of the FB@@ I , which classi@@ fy the state in relation to the number of such violations to the 16th rank of the country .
the warning is also an answer to a new Mis@@ sour@@ i law that would make it more difficult to su@@ e a company because of housing or employment discrimination .
prior to that , the American Civil Liber@@ ties Union ( AC@@ L@@ U ) issued travel warnings for Texas and Arizona , after the states adopted immigration laws that commit local law enforcement agencies to arrest people because of immigration violations , which will contribute to the further reform of the AC@@ L@@ U .
warnings are usually issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for other countries , but l@@ ately , interest groups have used the measure as a response to certain laws and trends within the United States .
the Del@@ aun@@ ching Project is elementary
the Fischer@@ bacher Weimar project is a successful project and will be continued next year .
the CD@@ U Par@@ liam@@ entary Members Peter White and K@@ ord@@ ula K@@ ov@@ ac have provided a picture on the spot .
representatives of the fishing village of CD@@ U together with Mayor Thomas Schneider and the two de@@ pu@@ ties met at the cemetery of the Schwen@@ de@@ mann family .
Markus Schwen@@ de@@ mann granted first insight into his farm , in which he farms 55 hectares of law@@ ns and 40 hectares of forest , 40 milk cows and as well as many k@@ itt@@ ens provided and accommodated in five apartments Feri@@ eng@@ a@@ este .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Black Forest &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is for him the alternative marketing path for the milk of his cows , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Schwen@@ de@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
only region@@ ales come to the table of the Feri@@ eng@@ a@@ este .
since he is also B@@ L@@ H@@ V president of Fis@@ her@@ bach he described the consec@@ ration project as &quot; essential . &quot;
I cannot manage to profit on such steep faces .
the gr@@ ass@@ land area care for a lot of work , a lot must be handled with the brush@@ cutter .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have to fight with the conditions and top@@ ography , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Schwen@@ de@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 2003 he took over the par@@ ental business and engaged it without chemical plant protection and fer@@ til@@ iser even if it does not lead to bio @-@ operation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for Mayor Thomas Schneider there was clear : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Comm@@ une has recognized the importance of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mind@@ set project &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
farmers would have to be supported at a cost of 3000 to 4000 euros per hect@@ are .
I hope that the aff@@ or@@ estation of the land could be dra@@ gged out for quite a while .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the biggest treasure we have is the people who work in agriculture and are thinking about how to continue their operation , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stressed the mayor . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the farmers are often in the criticism because of the promotion
in 2013 , a total of 25 plots were fenced by eleven participants .
the open area is thus 40 hectares , which are not to be aff@@ i@@ xed to at least 20@@ 23 .
of the total cost of EUR 71 million , half was promoted by leader , a quarter carried the municipality of Fis@@ her@@ bach .
thus the farmers remained 12 6@@ 10 euros , which they had to invest in 16.@@ 2 kilometers of pasture fence .
&quot; the big advantage is the lon@@ gevity of the f@@ ences , &quot; explained Schwen@@ de@@ mann .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; K@@ ord@@ ula K@@ ov@@ ac stressed : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you do a really good job , without farmers and farm women it doesn &apos;t work . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; also for Peter white stood firm : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; here , the best food is produced . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Land@@ scape District Directive ( L@@ PR ) Baden @-@ Württemberg grants the state support of wil@@ dest f@@ ences .
the aim is to maintain the Black Forest .
the condition is the presence of a conveyor belt specified by the L@@ PR .
in addition , the enclosed area must not be tractor @-@ free ( slope incl@@ ination above 35 percent ) and must therefore be threatened by aff@@ or@@ estation .
for the Fis@@ her@@ bach Wei@@ de@@ z@@ ren Project 2018 , the application of eight participants with 24 par@@ c@@ els , which would like to build almost 16 kilometres of fence , is currently underway .
the exhibition area corresponds to 35 hectares , the calculated costs are more than 112 000 euros .
is nothing sacred anymore ?
now the White House of Tr@@ ump is taking up the Statue of Liberty
the most secure sign of a regime change is when they begin to attack the statues .
the Americans appreciate these as well as any other - hence the carefully orchest@@ rated down@@ fall of Saddam Hussein at the Fir@@ s square in Bag@@ h@@ dad in 2003 .
Stephen Miller , one of the key ide@@ ologists of the Tr@@ ump @-@ regime , certainly knew what he did when he took a symbolic ax@@ e in a heated argument with Jim A@@ co@@ sta of CN@@ N about the President &apos;s proposals to drastically restrict the legal migration to the Statue of Liberty .
in order to remain fair , Miller did not attack the statue itself .
a hor@@ de of boat owners and Liberty @-@ im@@ it@@ ators would have landed him if he had done it .
but it took its importance , and in particular the meaning that it was attributed to as the famous poem by Emma Lazarus in 1903 , 17 years after the completion of the monument , his base was added .
when Miller A@@ co@@ sta wrote : &quot; I don &apos;t want to enter a complete thing about history here , but the Statue of Liberty is ... a symbol of American freedom that illumin@@ ates the world .
the poem you refer to , which was added later and is not part of the original Statue of Liberty . &quot;
Miller is fac@@ tually correct , but as he formulated it himself , it is not really about history .
it is about the contemporary response to the touching words of Lazarus , the only ones in which a state does not only invite any old immigrants , but the poor@@ est of the poor : &quot; your we@@ ary , your poor , / your oppressed masses who y@@ earn to breathe freely , and the mis@@ erable waste of your rich coasts . &quot;
there was never a time when the &quot; el@@ event@@ h tr@@ ash &quot; on our screens was better to see .
Miller did not engage in literary criticism - he made it clear that those people in Tr@@ um@@ ps USA are not welcome .
this conflict because of the significance of a statue is part of a broader political and cultural confrontation : it is in fact a conflict about the importance of America .
Lazarus - and her friends who used to place their words on the basis of their death - knew very well that they performed a highly political action .
the sculpture was intended to show the connections between French and American Rep@@ ublic@@ anism by portra@@ ying the female em@@ bodi@@ ment of freedom in a classical figur@@ ative portra@@ yal .
Lazarus has changed this meaning : in her poem the female figure is no longer abstract - she has received a voice .
and she gives herself a very different name : mother of the Ex@@ ile .
the connection of the poem with the image is a brilliant feminist coup and a devastating attack on American N@@ ati@@ vis@@ m .
and just how Lazarus changed the meaning of the statue , the people of the right wing wanted to change this for a long time .
the great writer of R@@ ush Lim@@ bau@@ gh , a sort of John the Baptist for the coming of Tr@@ ump , argued in 2010 that the Statue of Liberty would not invite anyone but rather an early Neo@@ conserv@@ atives bringing the American flame to the surrounding world : &quot; Lady Liberty is progres@@ sing .
it is to carry the torch of freedom from the United States into the rest of the world .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the torch is not to illumin@@ ate the way to the United States . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Lim@@ bau@@ gh came across quite unusual here .
the significance of the statue is entirely a question of the standpoint of perception .
the great imagin@@ ative deed of Lazarus was to see her as she was seen by the exhausted , w@@ ret@@ ched but hop@@ eful people after long and often horrible journeys on the de@@ cks of ships .
it is in the tru@@ est sense to see the world from the perspective of people seeking refuge and a chance to improve their lives .
their statue speaks to them the words of hope and welcome they must hear .
and this of course is not the perspective that Miller and Tr@@ ump ever want to acknowledge .
their torch is not to illumin@@ ate the way , but ign@@ ite the hatred that is their only source of power .
world Cup 2017 : N@@ eil Black pra@@ ises Scottish members of the UK team
E@@ ili@@ d@@ h Do@@ yle re@@ members a time when only two Sc@@ ots belonged to the team of Great Britain
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Power Director of the United Kingdom &apos;s athle@@ tics , N@@ eil Black says that the 16 @-@ member Scottish cont@@ ingent in world championship cad@@ res &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; will make a massive contribution to the team . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a record number of Scottish athletes was selected for London 2017 , starting on Friday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; black believes that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; something special in Scotland &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and the athle@@ tics of the United Kingdom must learn something from it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we welcome it and we try to understand it and we will continue it until we find it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Black . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I talk to people at the Scottish Institute of Sports and they think it has something to do with what they have done . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Scottish athletes think that it has something to do with what they have done .
British athle@@ tics : it has something to do with what they have done .
and also with the type on the street corner .
whatever the combination of circumstances is , it is absolutely brilliant . &quot;
several of the Scottish athletes are med@@ als candidates , including Laura Mu@@ ir and Andrew But@@ chart - who will compete against Sir M@@ on Far@@ ah on the 5,000 m track while E@@ ili@@ d@@ h Do@@ yle was chosen by the team as team captain .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; E@@ ili@@ d@@ h is rather modest . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
their speech was incredible , &quot; says Black .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a number of athletes , whether they were Scottish or wherever they live or train , went out of the room and felt very proud and were very motivated . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the passion and the real feeling that E@@ ili@@ d@@ h brought naturally were great . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Com@@ mon@@ wealth Silver Med@@ al winner , who will compete in the 400 m hur@@ d@@ les at its fifth world championships , says that it is &quot; incredible &quot; that 16 Sc@@ ots are in the British team .
Scotland &apos;s best overall number of athletes in the world championship was seven , which were achieved in 1983 and 2015 .
the middle @-@ distance runner Mu@@ ir leads this way and last year has set up five British and two European records .
it will take part in the 1,500 m and 5,000 m rounds .
Chris O &apos;@@ H@@ are , who runs 1,500 m , is another Scot@@ s@@ man to watch after a great season , which included the victory with the British Team Tri@@ als and the Anni@@ versary Games .
Do@@ yle re@@ members her first world championships as the only other Scot@@ s@@ man in Team Lee Mc@@ Conn@@ ell .
the team captain says that she is &quot; hu@@ gely proud &quot; of the fact that many of her comp@@ atri@@ ots are not only part of the team , but in some cases also join the med@@ als and the fin@@ als .
&quot; the special thing about being team captain is that it was chosen by the other members of the team so that it was a great honor anyway , but knowing that my te@@ amm@@ mates voted for me and chose me makes it something very special for me , &quot; she added .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; obviously I am very proud of all the Sc@@ ots belonging to the team . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it only shows how far we have come .
and they are here as established athletes , athletes , who want to climb on po@@ ds .
concerning my speech as a captain ?
yes , I think she went well .
I have only pointed out that we are very happy in this situation as we have a home world championship .
so it is really important to rely on this home support and benefit from the fact that we are back at the Olympiastadion again .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I get a second chance to go out and compete and it will simply be such a great atmosphere out there . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
block critics on Facebook : don &apos;t apply for a public office if you can &apos;t tolerate the heating of voters .
the father of our country knew something of bad press .
the Americans loved George Washington , but it did not take long before the papers struck him because of everything , from home affairs to his political principles .
he ino@@ cul@@ ated with criticism , certainly .
but he did not silence his critics .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for in the year 17@@ 83 Washington said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; freedom of speech can be taken away - and , stupid and mu@@ te we are led like sheep to slaughter . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this brings me to Mary@@ land to Gover@@ nor Lar@@ ry Ho@@ gan who has to work to be more like Washington .
Ho@@ gans &apos;s employees have blocked and deleted the contributions of at least 450 people who have expressed their views on their official Facebook page .
and the American Civil Liber@@ ties Union compl@@ ained him at the beginning of this week .
the governor &apos;s staff dismissed the complaint as fri@@ vol@@ ous , and the online commentary was full of a counter @-@ reaction with &quot; Na , and ? . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s just Facebook , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said many people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but it is important .
and it is particularly important when it is a type like Ho@@ gan .
this is a republi@@ can governor in an overwhelming democratic state that is amaz@@ ingly popular .
he has the second highest agreement of the nation &apos;s fifty govern@@ ors .
Ho@@ gan is not a reactionary heat @-@ head .
he has shown a firm hand in the leadership of his state and strict observ@@ ance of the principles .
he was also very skill@@ ful to use Facebook as the primary means to connect with his voters and play his hair @-@ less head after chemotherapy on his side .
therefore , the blocking of persons who come to the governor &apos;s side - which is a public forum , which is considered to be official and paid by employees who are paid with public tax dollars - is unnecessary and ultimately dangerous .
in an interview with The Washington Post , Ho@@ gan &apos;s spokesperson Am@@ elia Ch@@ asse defended the governor &apos;s actions and argued that the blocking of comments was nothing more than a moder@@ ation .
but it is too easy to use the image of tro@@ lls or sp@@ amm@@ ers or hat@@ eful people who swing the whi@@ p online .
the mail addressed with some of the real people who were blocked by Ho@@ gan .
and these are only real people who talk to their elected leaders : a teacher , an entrepren@@ eur and a priest , not tro@@ lls .
they all said their comments were respect@@ ful , thou@@ ghtful and not profound .
the pastor quoted the Bible in his mail and appe@@ aled to Ho@@ gan &apos;s Catholic faith .
At@@ tor@@ ney Lak@@ sh@@ mi Sar@@ ma Ram@@ ani von Bo@@ wie , M@@ d . , was not hat@@ eful , but she asked for hate crimes .
&quot; I said pol@@ itely that I was disappointed that there was no reaction to hate crimes and other current news , &quot; she wrote in the comments section of the message &quot; The Post . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I do not appreciate this idea when a number of people take a position on the same subject , then they are ignored by some rather than a so @-@ called collective effort and not recognized as a large group of affected citizens . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what the governor described as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; concentrated spam &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; would probably call another &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; interc@@ ession &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Facebook era makes it easy to cut a message by blocking a critic or dropping a negative comment .
it is much cleaner than in earlier times , if you had done the same thing that employees were sent to collect and burn newspapers with critical articles or to arrest and silence demonstr@@ ators .
but this is exactly what happens digitally .
Ho@@ gan is not the first public official to critici@@ ze Facebook and other social media .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; President Tr@@ ump is accused of Twitter users blocked by his Twitter feed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
one of the first mil@@ estones in this question was last week in Virginia .
the Chairman of the Board of Super@@ vis@@ ors of Lou@@ dou@@ n County was the last mend@@ ment to the First A@@ mend@@ ment , according to US District Ju@@ dge James C. C@@ ach@@ er@@ is in Alexand@@ ria , when she banned a vot@@ er from her Facebook page .
and in K@@ entu@@ cky , Gover@@ nor Matt Bev@@ in ( R ) also visited the AC@@ L@@ U because of its use of Facebook and Twitter .
this should not be so difficult .
at the time of Washington , the time of affordable por@@ tos had a similar effect as the Internet .
the number of newspapers multiplied between 17@@ 76 and 1800 , and anonymous writing recor@@ ders hit his lead .
and even then , Washington had anonymous Tro@@ lls .
the people who used pseu@@ don@@ y@@ ms such as &quot; Jur@@ ic@@ ola , &quot; &quot; Val@@ eri@@ us , &quot; &quot; Bel@@ is@@ arius &quot; and &quot; Por@@ tius , &quot; wrote all letters to newspapers that made Washington decisions .
peti@@ tions , which critic@@ ised his position on the Treaty of Am@@ ity , the trade and shipping with Britain , over@@ came his office , according to the historical documents collected by the online Pap@@ ers of George Washington Project .
but he did not silence her .
freedom of speech , dis@@ agreement and dis@@ courses belong to our nation .
and true leadership means accepting that .
Ron@@ an Raff@@ er@@ ty hopes for domestic comfort in the Renaissance club
the former European number 1 Ron@@ an Raff@@ er@@ ty will hope for home comfort over the next three days , as the Renaissance club in East Lo@@ thi@@ an will host the 25th edition of the Scottish Senior Open .
the Nor@@ di@@ re , who last year alongside Arch@@ er@@ field Links to the final round , before he lost Paul E@@ ales , is associated with the new venue and acts as a tournament ambassador in the name of the founder and CE@@ Os Jer@@ ry Sar@@ vad@@ i .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have seen how the Renaissance club was built and we see how he achieved his fame with this event , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Raff@@ er@@ ty said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; players will see this course from its best side , it is in a great state . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Jer@@ ry did a great job when he laid down this place .
he is a keen advoc@@ ate of this game and is proud of his performance here .
this is a great showcase for this course . &quot;
the English E@@ ales is looking forward to defending a championship first , even though he won the European Tour as well as the European Challenge Tour in his 32 @-@ year career .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this really feels very special , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the player based in South@@ port . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I couldn &apos;t defend the Extre@@ ma@@ dura Open because it was taken out of the programme in the year after I won it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
coming back to this part of the world is magical .
it is a wonderful place to play golf .
the memories of last year come back , and it was something special for me and my wife Shar@@ on to win here last year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was a really special time and one we will always appreciate . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Gary Or@@ r , who came to the European Senior Tour this year after his 50@@ th birthday , returns to his home ground for action .
this event will be its first Scottish performance since the Aber@@ deen Asset Management Scottish Open in 2013 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it always means a bit more when you play at home , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Or@@ r , the man from Hel@@ ens@@ burgh . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you want to do it well , but you also feel this extra pressure . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I really enjoyed playing again and I played a solid Golf .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m glad how it has gone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

less lung cancer by passive smoking
over the past two decades , fewer and fewer people have died because of passive smoking in lung cancer .
scientists from the University Hospital Hamburg @-@ E@@ pp@@ endorf ( U@@ KE ) come to this conclusion in a study .
&quot; according to our estimates , 16@@ 7 lung cancer cases are due to passive smoking per year , &quot; said Dr. Hei@@ ko Becher .
as a comparison , he drew up his own study on this subject of 1994 .
back then there have been 400 lung cancer cases for passive smoking a year in Germany .
the new research is published in the &quot; International Journal of Public Health . &quot;
domestic connections turn out to be very complex
the construction works in the Vill@@ inger Straße are in full swing and &quot; are reasonably in time , &quot; said the head of the building yard Fred Hein@@ ze .
in the area of the house annex@@ es the situation is more complicated than suspected , as there is a lot of mountains in the underground , which is not mentioned in the plans .
the traffic that obstruc@@ ts the construction works is a major problem for the construction company of St@@ ump@@ p .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the mot@@ orists &apos; ignorance of red lights and barriers is enormous , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Hein@@ ze . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the road was closed and only the regular buses were allowed to drive through .
Angelo Car@@ us@@ o , Mar@@ vin Ko@@ stor@@ z and Tim Ko@@ stor@@ z from the company St@@ ump@@ p have been working on the bridge for weeks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the hot days were already very exhau@@ sting . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but luckily we were supplied with cool mineral water by our friend Fritz Matt , &quot; says Mar@@ vin Ko@@ stor@@ z .
poverty and death in the Indones@@ ian gold country
if Bar@@ d@@ ina De@@ ge@@ i coo@@ ks dinner , she does not use a stove .
it even rarely uses a pot .
in her wooden house in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , the capital of the Pan@@ i@@ ai Reg@@ ina in the Un@@ quiet Indones@@ ian province of Pap@@ ua , the house@@ wife usually puts a sweet potato - locally called &quot; not@@ a &quot; - directly into the fireplace .
after half an hour the char@@ red tu@@ ber is taken out with ze@@ al@@ ous , un@@ washed hands and swal@@ lowed .
De@@ ge@@ i is sitting on the clay ground - she has no furniture - where she also performs her daily work , e.g. to wash clothes with soft water from the nearby sw@@ amp .
a bucket in a homeless room serves as a lat@@ rine .
as the youngest of the four wives of her husband , no fields were assigned to her .
poly@@ gam@@ y is common here .
of course , late to work can be dangerous : most of the village men are unemployed , and many drink heavily , and there are the soldiers here .
&quot; nobody dar@@ es to run around in the village after 17 o &apos;clock , &quot; she says .
it is a rare insight into the daily life in the high@@ lands of Pap@@ ua , a former Dutch colony , which was recorded in 1969 following a controversial referendum in Indonesia , when only 1,@@ 0@@ 26 elders were to vote in front of the occup@@ ying troops .
an existing movement , which stir@@ red up the independence of the Dutch government , quickly turned against the government of Jak@@ arta , which maintains the control of the region and exclu@@ des foreign journalists or legal monitors .
in 2003 , the province was officially divided into Pap@@ ua and Western Pap@@ ua , with the independent part of Pap@@ ua New Guinea that included the eastern part of the island .
En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali is as seclu@@ ded as it is . the journey includes a 90 @-@ minute flight from the provincial capital J@@ ay@@ ap@@ ura to Nab@@ ire and then a morning 5 @-@ hour drive with the car rental .
there is no public transport .
the city with about 19@@ ,000 inhabitants is made up of wooden houses , which are surrounded by bamboo f@@ ences , and made of corrugated iron roofs , which were converted by rust into different yel@@ low@@ ish tones .
only very few Indon@@ esi@@ ans have made their trip here , let alone journalists and practically no foreig@@ ner .
before Christian mission@@ aries arrived , Me@@ e P@@ ago Pap@@ u@@ ans worshipped a god called U@@ ga Tam@@ ee .
there were other changes .
&quot; we were not used to wearing these clothes , &quot; says De@@ ge@@ i , pointing to her lively , hand @-@ woven tur@@ ban , her dark shirt and her bright rock .
&quot; in the past , we had only leaves on our bodies . &quot;
Pap@@ ua is Indonesia &apos;s poor@@ est province where 28 % of people live under the poverty line and have some of the worst child mortality and liter@@ acy rates in Asia .
but it is also Indonesia &apos;s Gold@@ land .
the largest and most profitable gold mine in the world , Gr@@ ass Mountain , owned by the Free@@ port Mc@@ Mor@@ an from Phoenix , is located only 60 miles from Pan@@ i@@ ai , a province province in the size of New Jersey with 15@@ 3,000 inhabitants .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in 2015 alone , Free@@ port has min@@ ed $ 3.1 billion in gold and copper . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition , Pap@@ ua has wooden resources valued at an estimated $ 78 billion .
these riches , however , are a source of misery for the Pap@@ ua , which ensure that Indonesia &apos;s powerful military keeps a sti@@ fl@@ ing presence .
an investigation of 2005 in the New York Times reported that Free@@ port paid nearly 20 million US dollars between 1998 and 2004 , including up to $ 150@@ ,000 in a single officer .
Pap@@ u@@ an demands for greater autonomy thre@@ aten those golden go@@ ose and are treated mer@@ cil@@ essly .
according to information from activists , more than 500@@ ,000 Pap@@ ua have been killed and thousands have been ra@@ ped , tor@@ tured and imprisoned by the Indones@@ ian military since 1969 .
Mass@@ eci@@ es in Pap@@ ua &apos;s tribal high@@ land in the 1970 &quot; s have been declared genocide in accordance with the Asia human rights commission .
in the region alone , the Indones@@ ian police arrested more than 3,@@ 900 peaceful demonstr@@ ators last year .
&quot; we Wer@@ den Every@@ thing &quot; is written in a report of the Arch@@ dioc@@ ese Bris@@ ban@@ e from 2016 , in which reports about atro@@ cities of the previous year are contained , such as un@@ lawful kill@@ ings and torture - rape and electric attacks are particularly popular after another report - and the brutal suppression of peaceful demonstrations .
&quot; it is difficult to count the number of victims since every week incidents happen , &quot; says Andreas Har@@ son@@ o , Indonesia researcher for Human Rights Watch .
the screws have increased since Pap@@ ua &apos;s resources have an influ@@ x of sett@@ lers from other parts of Indonesia .
the population of 3.5 million inhabitants of the province is 83 % Christian , but demographic developments are changing as Muslim economic migrants are coming from the inhabited islands of Java , Bor@@ neo , Sum@@ atra and Sul@@ awes@@ i .
Jav@@ an@@ ese war@@ den cant@@ e@@ ens sell fried chicken and g@@ ado @-@ g@@ ado , a mixed vegetables served with pe@@ an@@ ut sauce .
local people are fighting to keep up here .
&quot; the migrants began to sell chi@@ ckens and vegetables on the traditional market cheaper than the local Pap@@ ua , &quot; says A@@ bet@@ h You , a 24 @-@ year @-@ old Pan@@ i@@ ai native , who moved to work in J@@ ay@@ ap@@ ura province capital .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it has ta@@ sted the native Pap@@ ua - the Mama @-@ Mama &#91; the women &#93; of Pap@@ ua . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Indones@@ ian President , Jok@@ o Wi@@ do@@ do , popul@@ arly known as Jok@@ ow@@ i , promised to address ine@@ qualities and violations of law in Pap@@ ua during his campaign in 2014 .
the former carp@@ enter secured 27 of the 29 districts of Pap@@ ua , including Pan@@ i@@ ai , on the way to the presidential palace in Jak@@ arta .
but in Pap@@ ua little has changed , and today the locals feel betra@@ yed .
&quot; our hearts are broken because we voted for Jok@@ ow@@ i in 2014 , with the expectation that he will fulfill our hopes that justice will be restored , &quot; You say .
in fact , Pan@@ i@@ ai broke down only two months after Jok@@ ow@@ is &apos;s inauguration in October .
on December 7 , 2014 , a group of 11 children was outside and sang Christmas car@@ ols in front of a camp fire in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali when two Indones@@ ian soldiers broke out on a motorcycle through the darkness .
the frigh@@ tened children told them that they should turn off their head@@ lights .
one of the soldiers took an attack on her tone and later returned with four soldiers , the local pastor Y@@ av@@ ed@@ t T@@ eb@@ ai .
the soldiers , who had d@@ rank , ch@@ ased and struck the group with their gun @-@ pist@@ ons , said victims and witnesses .
then one of the soldiers fired into the group of children .
one child , the 16 @-@ year @-@ old Y@@ uli@@ anus Y@@ ei@@ mo , was so severely beaten that he fell into the coma .
a few hours later , the building of the nearby government commission was set on fire and things escal@@ ated the next day .
about 1,000 young Pap@@ ua men , women and children gathered on a football ground in front of the local police station and the Military Command Center to demand justice .
they carried cerem@@ onial hunting arches and carried the Wa@@ ita @-@ Dance - in the circle continuously and i@@ iti@@ sing a bird song - from Pap@@ ua Me@@ e P@@ ago @-@ tribe .
some demonstr@@ ators started throwing stones on police and military posts .
when the mood was heated , the soldiers sent a command over an internal radio : &quot; if the masses are resist@@ ing more than three times , they shoot them dead , &quot; is said in an official document of TI@@ ME , which was not released to the local media .
Y@@ er@@ em@@ ias Kay@@ ame , 56 , head of the K@@ ego K@@ oto district of En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , saw the threatening danger and called for peace and called for the crowd to return home .
no one was able to listen in the mood .
&quot; when I turned around , I was suddenly shot in my left wrist , &quot; he said TI@@ ME on the ver@@ and@@ ah of his colorful painted wooden house .
Kay@@ ame still doesn &apos;t know who fired , but says that the bul@@ let came out of the ranks of the soldiers assembled here .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was crowded , many shots were fired , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he adds . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the native man Al@@ fi@@ us You@@ w was hit three times , so his c@@ ousin , who was witness of shooting .
&quot; I ran to him and searched his body to make sure he was it , &quot; said Y@@ oh@@ anes , who only bears a name like many Indon@@ esi@@ ans , the TI@@ ME in glo@@ omy mood .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I saw that he was dead ... I kis@@ sed him . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the chief inspec@@ tor of the Pap@@ ua police , Y@@ ot@@ je Men@@ de , told repor@@ ters that his officers wanted to &quot; secure &quot; their station because they were attacked .
&quot; we must defend ourselves if people thre@@ aten to kill us , &quot; said the spokes@@ man of the Pap@@ ua police , Commissioner Pu@@ d@@ jo Sul@@ zi@@ yo , in 2015 .
&quot; it &apos;s about life and death . &quot;
according to Human Rights Watch , five young demonstr@@ ators were killed and many others wounded .
the news about the kill@@ ings was only filtered on the following day after Jak@@ arta .
for three weeks , Jok@@ ov@@ i in J@@ ay@@ ap@@ ura held a passionate speech in which he expressed sympathy for the families of the victims and s@@ wore to address the historical ab@@ norm@@ alities in Pap@@ ua .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I want this case to be resolved immediately , so it will no longer happen in the future , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; security Minister Wi@@ ran@@ to said in October 2016 that he establishes an extra@@ judicial mechanism for the re@@ fut@@ ation of historical human rights violations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the exc@@ uses began almost immediately .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; most injuries have occurred a long time ago . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
some were in the 90 &apos;s and the beginning of the 2000 @-@ s .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the point is that we are committed to addressing these violations , but there are processes that must pass through , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
then Wi@@ ran@@ to made a retreat when he spoke to TI@@ ME on June 5 in Jak@@ arta , and said he had no plans to set up a complaint in Pap@@ ua .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; instead , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; everything is governed by law , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot;
Wi@@ ran@@ to , whom the UN charged with crimes against humanity , demanding more than 1,000 victims of death in East Tim@@ or in 1999 , said that 11 cases of violations of human rights in Pap@@ ua were already included , including the Pan@@ i@@ ai incident .
families of the Pan@@ i@@ ai victims responded viol@@ ently to such claims .
&quot; I was inter@@ viewed four times over the last three years , but there was no progress , &quot; says Y@@ oh@@ anes .
&quot; I am tired . &quot;
he says that years later he still lives in fear .
&quot; I &apos;m afraid , &quot; he says .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m afraid of being arrested by the military , I &apos;m afraid to be shot . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his brother Y@@ ac@@ ob@@ us asser@@ ted that people in Pan@@ i@@ ai are afraid to discuss the incident .
he says that he was defeated by the military after he helped to bury four of the victims .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after I had buried the corp@@ ses , the military sought me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the sho@@ ot@@ ings have not ceased .
on Tuesday , the Indones@@ ian police fired on vill@@ agers in the neighborhood of Pan@@ i@@ ais neighborhood of Dei@@ y@@ ai .
during a confrontation between vill@@ agers and the manager of a construction company who refused to bring a unconscious man to hospital , one person and 17 others were injured , including children .
the man , the 24 @-@ year @-@ old R@@ avi@@ anus Dou@@ w , who was drow@@ ned when he was fishing in a nearby river , died on the way to the hospital .
excited vill@@ agers prot@@ ested in front of the company &apos;s site office .
the police said that the vill@@ agers threw stones on officers who responded by firing warnings .
but natives say that the mobile Brig@@ ade ( Indones@@ ian param@@ il@@ itary police ) began shooting at the crowd and killed one .
&quot; we were so in panic , we are afraid that there will be ven@@ ge@@ ance , &quot; says the 29 @-@ year @-@ old dom@@ ing@@ gu Ba@@ di@@ i , who lives near the hospital and witnessed how the injured were quickly delivered here , &quot; said TI@@ ME .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I hid myself two days in my house . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Dei@@ y@@ ai Parliament has called upon the officers to take account and withdraw the mobile bri@@ g@@ ade of the police .
Pan@@ i@@ ai was always an un@@ rest for the Indones@@ ian government .
the lack of meaningful development strengthens the dis@@ satisfaction of the family members Me@@ e , Mon@@ i , Dan@@ i and dam@@ al , who live in the green high@@ lands of Pap@@ ua .
many joined the Free Pap@@ ua Movement ( O@@ PM ) , the rebel army claiming to defend the rights of the Pap@@ ua by inf@@ ecting spor@@ adi@@ c attacks and kidn@@ app@@ ings of Indones@@ ian soldiers .
some of the top O@@ PM guides are from Pan@@ i@@ ai , including Ta@@ di@@ us Yo@@ gi and Daniel Yu@@ das Ko@@ go@@ ya .
in response to this , in recent years thousands of people in Pan@@ i@@ ai have been arrested and arbitr@@ arily taken into custody under the pre@@ text of &quot; safegu@@ arding national sovereignty . &quot;
some never stop again .
among the people in Pap@@ ua , Pan@@ i@@ ai is known as &quot; a tragic , forgotten place . &quot;
poverty increases dis@@ satisfaction .
the little rice sold in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali is too expensive for locals .
bread is just beyond reach .
people here are building up everything they eat : especially not@@ a and fruit and leaf@@ y vegetables .
agriculture is the task of women to process four or five fields of sweet potato .
they keep most of the harvest for the family while the rest is sold on the local market .
ten pieces of Not@@ a cost only 10,000 Indones@@ ian ru@@ pe@@ es ( 75 c@@ ents ) .
in the course of time , economic ine@@ qualities between the native Pap@@ ua and the new migrants have grown , which have arrived in greater numbers since the opening of new flight routes to the airport of Nab@@ ire .
the few jobs that exist in the region generally address the better educated and aff@@ lu@@ ent migrants .
Pap@@ ua rarely have capital or the necessary skills to make their own companies competitive .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; young people are not interested in staying in the village ... for there are no jobs or money , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says John Gob@@ ai , Chairman of the Pan@@ i@@ ai tribe . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
isolation keeps the eyes of the world far from Pap@@ ua .
beyond that , restrictions in the reporting of international media remain ten@@ se .
at the beginning of the year French journalists Fran@@ ck Esc@@ u@@ die and Ba@@ sil@@ le Long@@ ch@@ amp were de@@ ported for lack of coordination with related institutions from Pap@@ ua , although they were given the rare permission to film .
according to P@@ hel@@ im K@@ ine , the Deputy Asia Director of Human Rights Watch , the promises of Jok@@ ow@@ is &apos;s election campaign to raise restrictions on reporting to promote transparency and development were not realized .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are new dangers for foreign journalists trying to report from Indonesia &apos;s un@@ rest eastern provinces of Pap@@ ua and West@@ pap@@ ua : visa refusal and a black list , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in an explanation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; lack of press control means that international pressure on Indones@@ ian government remains largely confined to the immediate neighbours of Pap@@ ua . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in March , six Pacific states - T@@ ong@@ a , Nau@@ ru , Palau , Tu@@ val@@ u , the Marshall Islands and the Solomon Islands - called on the UN Human Rights Council to investigate the &quot; different and widespread injuries &quot; in Pap@@ ua , including the Pan@@ i@@ ai firing .
the same countries have historically seen the O@@ PM .
the spokes@@ man of the Indones@@ ian Ministry of Foreign Affairs Ar@@ r@@ man@@ ath@@ a N@@ asi@@ r rejected the alleg@@ ations of the group and said journalists in Jak@@ arta : &quot; in Indonesia there is still a democratic system , and there are free media , so it is difficult to cover the evidence of human rights violations . &quot;
local people want more foreign governments to take note of this .
when an official delegation from the Netherlands attended , under the direction of the Human Rights Ambassador K@@ ees Van Ba@@ ar , J@@ ay@@ ap@@ ura on 4 May , locals broke their silence and urged him &quot; We want freedom , &quot; according to a source that also participated in the meeting , but remain anonymous .
Indonesia has another presidential election in 2019 , but the Pap@@ ua should say that they will probably not vote for Jok@@ ow@@ i again .
&quot; Jok@@ ow@@ i is a man who has good intentions , but he is surrounded by the people involved in the Pan@@ i@@ ai shots , &quot; says Gob@@ ai , Chairman of the Board of Directors .
he wants Jok@@ ow@@ i to know that the Pan@@ i@@ ai people , except that it lives under the constant threat of a pre@@ dat@@ ory military , is located in poor educational and health services .
Gob@@ ai says that the Pan@@ i@@ ai people , like other Pap@@ ua , consider their voice for Jok@@ ow@@ i as a &quot; guilt &quot; he has to pay back .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they don &apos;t need money , they just want justice , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in spite of threats and in@@ timi@@ dation , families of the Pan@@ i@@ ai victims carried out a last symbolic act of de@@ fi@@ ance : the corp@@ se of a victim was buried on a site exactly opposite the police and the military station .
they know they will never give them justice , but at least they don &apos;t forget those responsible for their crimes .
&quot; a member of our family was killed , &quot; says Y@@ ac@@ ob@@ us with his head .
&quot; what else can we do ? &quot;
fire capture the &apos; Tor@@ ch &apos; sky@@ scra@@ per from Dubai for the second time
a fire took place on Friday in one of the world &apos;s highest residential towers in Dubai and forced hundreds of inhabitants to flee from the 3@@ 37 @-@ meter high , 79 @-@ story building .
it is the second fire which , in just two years , swe@@ eps through the high @-@ rise , which is accidentally called the Tor@@ ch Tower ( tor@@ ches tower ) .
the building was evacu@@ ated , injuries were not reported , and there was no direct word about the cause of the flame .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we slept and we got up at the fire alarm and shou@@ ting people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we ran down the stairs , and it took about 10 minutes to get down from the 50@@ th floor , &quot; an inhabit@@ ant told his name as George ang@@ ab , Reu@@ ters .
Du@@ ba@@ is civil protection authorities said that the fire fighting units were extingu@@ ishing the fire at 4.@@ 00 a.m. local time ( 00@@ .@@ 00 GMT ) and cooled down the building .
the government said that she was working on providing accommodation to those affected .
the incident can resur@@ rec@@ t questions about the safety of materials used in outdoor areas of high @-@ rise buildings all over the world .
an investigation by the management of the Tor@@ ch building after its fire in 2015 revealed that most of the damage from covering , exterior cl@@ adding to decoration or insulation , came .
in the UK , the police said they believed that the system of plates for isolation and cl@@ adding on the London Gren@@ fell Tower in June could have contributed to the rapid spread of a fire in which about 80 people died .
no Davis Cup Reform : next Best @-@ of @-@ Five
the President of the International Tennis Federation ( IT@@ F ) has passed through with his great Davis Cup cou@@ p at the General Assembly .
at the meeting in Ho Chi Min@@ h City , the proposal for this sport was to play a revolutionary proposal for this sport , not only to play Davis Cup sing@@ les on two sets of swe@@ ep@@ st@@ akes , which did not support the required two @-@ thirds majority .
the often very long , but also therefore highly valued five @-@ sentence classics remain the traditional competition .
6@@ 3.@@ 54 per cent of member countries voted for reform , the goal of the IT@@ F president David Hag@@ ger@@ ty was therefore only scar@@ cely missed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we respect this decision , but are disappointed that our member nations did not accept the entire reform package for the Davis Cup and F@@ ed Cup . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need a change in order to secure the long @-@ term future of these iconic and historic competitions , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hag@@ ger@@ ty said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
one will continue to work on improving the application .
even before the vote , the proposal had already come up before the proposal to fill the final on a neutral place .
new from 2018 are only comparatively small details : in the following year , the fin@@ alists will have the right to host the Davis Cup and the F@@ ed Cup in the following year .
in order to reduce the costs for the organizers , the requirements regarding training grounds etc. are facilit@@ ated and players will have to complete less official media appointments in front of the Davis Cup .
more than 1 out of 5 US travelers bring forbidden items to the aircraft , find out a survey
a survey among passengers showed that more than 20 percent were smu@@ g@@ gled deliberately or un@@ consciously prohibited items at the control points of the US Transportation Security Administration , including at least 6 percent who entered the aircraft while they accidentally wore forbidden knives or other items with blades .
less than 1 per cent claimed they had been late discovered that they had gone ast@@ ray with fire@@ arms , amm@@ unition or explo@@ sives .
the survey was conducted among more than 1,000 people - provided by a Jet Charter service , the Str@@ at@@ os Jet Char@@ ters Inc . , also noted that younger travellers were more likely to ignore the rules .
from those surv@@ eyed who admitted that they know@@ ingly tried to fly with something forbidden by T@@ SA , 19.@@ 7 per cent of mill@@ enni@@ als were compared with less than 15 percent who were members of Generation X .
the most common items that were deliberately rush@@ ed by T@@ SA agents were food and liquids .
more than 3 percent admitted having know@@ ingly carried articles with blades by security control , while 2.2 percent of the female respon@@ dents and 3.@@ 7 percent of the male respon@@ dents also confirmed that they had intentionally brought forbidden drugs to the plane .
the company said it had asked travelers throughout the country to find out how many ad@@ vert@@ ently smu@@ g@@ gled goods from airport security and how many would have done it intentionally .
it is no surprise that the people who are most likely to wear jewelry - know@@ ingly or unknow@@ ingly - wear the safety , those who are most frequently flying .
the company , however , points out that the T@@ SA guidelines are a bit complicated and conf@@ using .
people are often unsure which liquids they may take with or how much of it .
it is therefore no surprise that the largest amount of liquids seized by T@@ SA are forbidden fluids .
for a while the people thought T@@ SA could look at books as smu@@ g@@ gled goods .
liquids are allowed on domestic flights , but not on international flights .
El@@ on Mus@@ k doesn &apos;t matter : tens of thousands of Tes@@ la customers cancel order
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Elektro @-@ Taus@@ end@@ s@@ ass@@ a El@@ on Mus@@ k is pleased to deal with the huge number of pre @-@ orders for his new Tes@@ la Model 3 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in doing so , he has been suggest@@ ing that some of the customers have already withdrawn their non @-@ binding reservation .
in addition to the ever triumph@@ ant figures on sales increases and even more gigantic sales targets , Tes@@ la Chef El@@ on Mus@@ k has revealed a different , less brilliant figure for the first time at the announcement of the latest quarterly balance : the cancellation of the new mass market model 3 .
over the past few months , Mus@@ k frequently had over 500@@ ,000 pre @-@ orders for the new car , whose extra@@ dition has just begun .
now Mus@@ k ad@@ mits : 6@@ 3,000 have already been withdrawn from the total 5@@ 18@@ ,000 pre @-@ orders .
critics have always pointed out that they are just non @-@ binding reservations .
in case of cancellation , Tes@@ la will return the 1000 Euro ( US $ 1000 in the United States and 1000 Po@@ unds ) &quot; Reser@@ vation Form . &quot;
at present 45@@ ,000 such non @-@ binding reservations suggest that Mus@@ k cleared up in a telephone conference with analysts .
however , the Tes@@ la boss does not believe that the cancellation of about 12 percent of all orders could become a problem .
his argument : the challenge in the ambitious growth targets is not in demand but on the production side .
last year , Tes@@ la delivered 8@@ 4,000 vehicles .
in 2018 , all models will be put together - 500@@ ,000 will be one million by 2020 .
the demand for this is obvious .
according to Mus@@ k , 1800 reservations are made per day .
anyone who orders a Model 3 today may expect delivery at the earliest in the second half of 2018 - if Tes@@ la manages to drive his brand new production lines tested in practice without any major interrup@@ tions with maximum capacity utilization .
many experts doubt that this is possible .
if it comes to major delays , then the non @-@ binding of reservations may become a problem for Tes@@ la .
because then the company cannot prevent dis@@ satisfied customers from running away in dro@@ ves .
EPA chief P@@ ru@@ itt rush@@ es back to reduce emissions because of the Obama @-@ Er@@ a rules
a day after he was accused of 15 states , Scott P@@ ru@@ itt , head of the Environmental Protection Agency , with@@ drew his previous decision to delay the implementation of the Obama era rules in order to reduce the emissions caused by smo@@ g causing air pollutants .
P@@ ru@@ itt presented the changes when his agency turned out to be more responsive to the needs of state environmental authorities than previous administr@@ ations .
he did not mention the law@@ suit raised against his previous position in a Federal Court of Appe@@ al .
it is about a deadline exp@@ iring on 1 October for countries to comply with the standards of 2015 for down @-@ to @-@ earth o@@ zone .
P@@ ru@@ itt announced in June that it would delay its compliance with one year to give its authority more time to study the plan and to avoid &quot; interfer@@ ing with local decisions or ham@@ per@@ ing economic growth . &quot;
P@@ ru@@ itt , who was prosec@@ utor of O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma before his appointment , was a long time a reliable opponent of strict environmental protection regulations .
since its arrival in Washington , P@@ ru@@ itt has repeatedly gone over to block or delay regulations that resist the chemical industry and the industry of fossil fuels .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the sudden revers@@ al of Wednesday is the latest legal set@@ back for the P@@ ru@@ denti@@ als regulatory roll back agenda . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
last month , a Federal Court of Appe@@ al in Washington decided that the EPA administrator exceeded his authority when he tried to delay the implementation of a rule of the Obama administration , the oil and gas companies to monitor and reduce the methane leak@@ age .
in a statement released on Wednesday evening , P@@ ru@@ itt suggested that his revers@@ al at o@@ zone standards quite simply reinfor@@ ces the willingness of the EPA to cooperate with the states through the complex process of timely fulfillment of the new standards .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in previous administr@@ ations , the EPA has often not adher@@ ed to deadlines for implementing and then waiting to be accused of activists and others , and in an agreement the deadline for carrying out , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said P@@ ru@@ itt , who compl@@ ained the EPA more than a dozen times in his previous job . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we do not believe in regulation by judicial proceedings , and we take deadlines seriously . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we also take the law and the authority that is given to us seriously . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , the EPA statement that P@@ ru@@ itt will some@@ time use its &quot; authority to delay and all other legally available authority &quot; to ensure that the provisions &quot; are based on a solid policy and the best available information . &quot;
the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans in Congress push for a more comprehensive new version of the o@@ zone rules .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a draft approved last month is intended to delay the implementation of the 2015 rules by at least eight years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the measure was not yet set up in the Senate .
the New York At@@ tor@@ ney General , Eric Schnei@@ der@@ man , who led the coalition of states who had lam@@ ented the EPA this week , said the group wanted to maintain legal pressure .
&quot; the conversion of the EPA - according to our complaints - is an important gain for health and safety of these 6.@@ 7 million New Yor@@ kers and the more than 115 million Americans who are directly affected by the smo@@ g that flows into their communities , &quot; said Schnei@@ der@@ man .
new York joined in this case California , Connec@@ ti@@ cut , Del@@ aware , Illinois , I@@ owa , Ma@@ ine , Massachusetts , Minn@@ es@@ ota , New Mexico , O@@ reg@@ on , Penn@@ syl@@ van@@ ias , Rho@@ de Island , Ver@@ mont and Washington and the District of Columbia .
soil @-@ o@@ zone occurs when pollutants from cars , power plants , oil refin@@ eries , chemical plants and other sources in the atmosphere react to sunlight .
the stagn@@ ant smo@@ g can cause serious respiratory problems in sensitive groups of people , and every year contribute to thousands of premature deaths .
representatives of public health care and environ@@ ment@@ alists rejo@@ iced over P@@ ru@@ ch &apos;s surprising course changes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is disturbing how much pressure it takes to get this reasonable step from the responsible for the protection of the air we breathe , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Lor@@ i An@@ n Bur@@ d from Center for Bi@@ ological Di@@ versity . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we must fight against the ideological cr@@ us@@ ade of the Tr@@ ump government to address environmental pollution and its special interests . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Tum@@ lingen celebrates 750 years of St. Hil@@ arius @-@ Church
750 years of St. Hil@@ arius @-@ Church : on the occasion of the anniversary of the church , the old cemetery area in Tum@@ lingen on Sunday , 16 July , is invited to a seren@@ ade at 4 : 30 p.m .
whether its idyllic location and beautiful views of the village is the historic St. Hil@@ arius system a popular place to stay .
the visitors of the Six@@ th Bene@@ fi@@ z Ser@@ en@@ ade can be en@@ chan@@ ted by this powerful place .
the rescue and preservation of the oldest building in the village have made friends and supporters Tum@@ lin@@ gens their concerns .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Walter Mart@@ ini stresses : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a unique village gem . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 12@@ 67 St. Hil@@ ari@@ us@@ kap@@ elle was first mentioned in documents : count Hermann von Sul@@ z sold &quot; the mountain with the parish church of Tum@@ lingen and the Vo@@ g@@ tei &quot; at Magi@@ ster Eber@@ hard von Hor@@ b and his brother Dietrich for 20 Mark silver .
according to the document , on the hill of Tum@@ linger , apart from the former parish church , there was also a splendid courtyard , which belonged to the church or the patron saint and not the other way around .
there were also people there .
as it emerges from the description of the Ober@@ am@@ tes Freu@@ den@@ stadt from 18@@ 58 , it was next to the Unter@@ dorf and the Ober@@ dorf , which are still to be recognized today in the town@@ scape of Tum@@ lingen , the &quot; mountain &quot; of the third , the magnificent settlement @-@ core of the village .
old maps dating back to 1600 are supporting these historical facts .
the right of pat@@ ron@@ age arose from the early medieval church law .
a gent@@ leman who built a church and occupied with a priest , continued to remain the owner of this church and could also bequ@@ e@@ ath this church .
this was accompanied by the right to appoint a pastor or to propose a new parish priest to the bishop .
there were three altars in the church and two bells on the tower .
the size of the two is sh@@ attered at Christmas 16@@ 73 .
the newly created bell sounded for the first time in 16@@ 92 , but later had to be handed over to the Second World War in 1942 .
in the Thi@@ r@@ ty Years &apos; War ( 16@@ 16 to 16@@ 48 ) window pan@@ es were inserted and the bel@@ fry were stolen .
the roof was le@@ aking .
in 17@@ 96 French troops camped near the church .
they broke out the pul@@ pit and the church @-@ mill and used it as fire@@ wood .
the remains of the church threatened to collapse in 18@@ 09 .
until 18@@ 69 the tomb of Hil@@ arius cemetery also served as the last resting place for the dead from Hör@@ schwei@@ ler .
in 18@@ 23 the cemetery was extended and the church of Hil@@ ari@@ us@@ kirche was demol@@ ished .
only the steep@@ le was left standing .
in the New Year &apos;s Eve 18@@ 34 a storm split the steep@@ le and half collap@@ sed .
in order to prevent mis@@ fortune , the tower was abandoned .
only the tower still existing today was preserved as a witness of the 750 @-@ year @-@ old church history .
today Horst K@@ all@@ berger and Rolf @-@ Dieter Was@@ em are cultiv@@ ating the Hil@@ arius system as successor of Dieter Do@@ ck@@ horn .
as organizers , the friends and supporters Tum@@ lin@@ gens on Sunday , July 16 , invite the sixth Ser@@ en@@ ade to the old cemetery at St. Hil@@ ari@@ us@@ kap@@ elle .
this is designed by the com@@ bo of the Ke@@ pler @-@ Gymnasium Freu@@ den@@ stadt and with contributions by Kurt Kü@@ bler and Rein@@ hold Mat@@ tei@@ s .
local manager Hart@@ mut Rom@@ ann is talking about the final word .
the program starts at 4.@@ 30 p.m .
admission is from 3 : 30 pm .
to the end of the Ser@@ en@@ ade , a trunk takes place in front of the cemetery .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; enjoy a summer evening under the shade of old trees and with a wide view across meadows down to the forest , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the organizers challenge the fantastic views . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Ser@@ en@@ ade takes place only in dry weather .
the organizers are hoping for many supporters for the preservation of the historic St. Hil@@ arius system , which is of importance for tum@@ ors and listeners .
the friends and supporters of Tum@@ lin@@ gens feel particularly committed to their home care , as Ser@@ en@@ ade @-@ organis@@ er Walter Mart@@ ini re@@ affir@@ ms .
association wants to test approval of wind turbines
Bo@@ is@@ heim def@@ ends himself &quot; does not see a legal pre@@ condition for construction and has therefore turned to the coun@@ cils .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bo@@ is@@ heim &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Association calls upon Andreas Co@@ enen ( CD@@ U ) to take back his approval for the construction of planned wind turbines in the Bo@@ is@@ heimer N@@ ette . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is un@@ lawful .
the association ar@@ gues that at the time of approval on December 30 , 2016 at the Bo@@ is@@ heimer N@@ ette no wind turbines could have been approved , as at the time in Vier@@ sen only at the border to Sch@@ wal@@ m@@ tal a wind power concentration zone existed .
within this concentration zone , construction and operation of wind turbines is basically possible , but at the same time the concentration zone causes the exclusion of wind energy utilization for the rest of the city .
such zones are intended to prevent &quot; as@@ par@@ ag@@ us &quot; of the landscape .
the city of Vier@@ sen had a second wind @-@ force concentration zone in the Bo@@ is@@ heimer N@@ ette , a few days earlier , but the district government of Düsseldorf had not approved , because of a mold defect .
&quot; according to Christoph Er@@ k@@ ens , Chairman of &quot; Bo@@ is@@ heim , &quot; Christoph Er@@ k@@ ens , president of &quot; Bo@@ is@@ heim , &quot; is not un@@ lawful due to the lack of planning rights . &quot;
state @-@ of @-@ the @-@ art status : before the summer break , the city council has once again decided on the wind concentration zone in the Bo@@ is@@ heimer N@@ ette ; approval by the district government is still pending .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; recognition : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at this point , the granting of approval for the construction of wind turbines is legally excluded . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the circle confirms the receipt of the request .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the corresponding letter has entered the circle of Vier@@ sen since last week , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a spokes@@ man . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the circle takes them on the occasion of re@@ viewing the matter again .
however , they do not expect the procedure to be stopped .
with regard to ongoing proceedings in the Administr@@ ative Court , the circle on Thursday did not want to express itself in terms of content on the argum@@ entation of the association &quot; Bo@@ is@@ heim . &quot;
the NEW Re , a subsidiary of the NEW , is planning the construction of four 200 @-@ metre @-@ high wind turbines on an area at the Bo@@ is@@ heimer N@@ ette .
last year , the company , in which the city of Vier@@ sen was indirectly involved , had concluded le@@ ases with the owner of the approximately 65 hectares of land .
with the construction of the four wind turbines , the electricity needs of around 11 400 households should be covered - this corresponds to roughly one fifth of the electricity needs of all four @-@ sen@@ ed households .
the NEW Re aims to invest some 20 million euros .
last summer , Vier@@ sen &apos;s City Council gave the green light to the purchase of three wind turbines in the Lin@@ ni@@ ch wind park near Aachen and a participation in a wind turbine plant in Ü@@ bach @-@ Pal@@ enberg in Hein@@ sberg district .
car and tractor crash together : woman dies in terrible accident
on Friday morning , one terrible traffic accident occurred at 10 o &apos;clock on the L 3@@ 33 between Nieder@@ wal@@ men@@ ach and Bo@@ gel ( Rhein @-@ L@@ ahn @-@ Kreis ) .
a woman was seriously injured .
two further persons were slightly injured .
the state road remained closed for hours .
according to police data , a 17 @-@ year @-@ old girl from Bor@@ ni@@ ch with her passenger car carried the L 3@@ 33 in the direction of Bo@@ gel with her 53 @-@ year @-@ old mother as an accompanying person .
city and dealer plan &quot; home @-@ shopping &quot; -@@ weekend
bad Lan@@ gen@@ sal@@ a@@ er and people from the region are to re@@ discover shopping in the city centre in September .
the business association and the municipal administration intend to use the weekend on September 8 and 9 in order to enti@@ ce the inhabitants to the shopping spre@@ e in the city centre .
as the chairman of the commercial association , Christian König , announced , the &quot; Heimat @-@ Sh@@ oppen &quot; weekend will raise customers awareness of what offers their own city holds apart from the usual supermarket goods .
accordingly , a market with regional suppliers is planned , similar to the weekly market .
in addition , domestic companies should present themselves to their training places .
in addition , the shops of the city centre will invite you to go shopping at midnight .
in doing so , the action is aimed not only on residents of the city and the near@@ er region .
in preparation are commerci@@ als on the radio , an internet video and printed bags pointing to the action weekend , says Christian König .
municipal administration and business association co @-@ operate with the Chamber of Commerce and Industry .
this makes the commercial association and the city a further stage of the project &quot; Attrac@@ tive city centre . &quot;
this includes new offers , such as the first &quot; Active Day &quot; to Brun@@ nen@@ fest , with sales so@@ ff@@ ed Sunday , talks with all professionals and hosts in order to move them to active participation .
also attractive offers on Saturday and the reno@@ unc@@ ement of parking fees on this day are part of the concept .
in addition , customer potentials should be newly developed or re @-@ opened .
these include spa guests and tourists .
but also many locals lost the city centre when shopping out of sight .
in the end everyone would have to contribute to li@@ ven the city center - to land@@ lords , businesses of the whole city and clubs .
it was a matter of overcoming the le@@ th@@ ar@@ gy with a network that had spread to some extent in the spring .
Bir@@ git St@@ reich , head of the I@@ HK @-@ Center in Müh@@ l@@ hausen , announced that five Thur@@ in@@ gian cities take part in Germany &apos;s third &quot; home @-@ shopping &quot; day .
in addition to Bad Lan@@ gen@@ sal@@ za , this is Weimar , S@@ ö@@ mmer@@ da , Hei@@ ligen@@ stadt and B@@ leich@@ ero@@ de .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the day should &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; promote the appreciation of local trade and emphasize its importance for the common good of our cities , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the action under the leadership of the I@@ HK and with many partners also makes it clear that every citizen can influence his / her purchasing behaviour as a direct environment .

Tr@@ ump put pressure on telep@@ hon@@ y calls from telephone calls Mexico under pressure because of the payment of the boundary wall
telephone calls between US President Donald Tr@@ ump and leaders of Mexico and Australia have been published by the Washington Post .
on January 27th , Tr@@ ump asked En@@ rique P@@ ena N@@ ie@@ to to call on the Mexican president En@@ rique P@@ ena N@@ ie@@ to to publicly say that he would not pay for a planned boundary wall .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said to him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; You cannot tell the press . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Tr@@ ump started his presidential campaign with the promise to build a wall on the southern border of the USA , and s@@ wore to let Mexico pay for the project .
tran@@ scri@@ bed of his first call with the Australian Prime Minister Mal@@ col@@ m Turn@@ bull have also been published and revealed a ten@@ se exchange .
Mr. Tr@@ ump said Mr. Turn@@ bull told us that a trade for the USA mig@@ rated to Australia was &quot; ridi@@ culous , &quot; &quot; bad &quot; and &quot; dum@@ b &quot; and that the existence on the trade that was medi@@ ated by the Obama administration would look like a &quot; Dep@@ p &quot; after he proposed a ban on the res@@ ett@@ lement of refugees in the United States .
Mr. Tr@@ ump ended the call after he had said Mr. Turn@@ bull &quot; that &apos;s the most unpleasant call for all day . &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want this n --@@ -- r Roger ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the man ro@@ ars . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; get him out of the car ! &quot;
scre@@ aming broke the silence when a young black man was dra@@ gged from the passenger &apos;s seat .
luckily , this aw@@ ful scene , which was played on July 22nd , is just a follow @-@ up .
but when a loop is thrown around the neck of &quot; Roger , &quot; almost all of them met very real si@@ ghs in the audience .
since 2005 , citizens have come back to Mo@@ ore &apos;s Ford Bridge to im@@ itate the night in which two black pairs - Roger and Dor@@ othy Mal@@ com as well as George and Ma@@ e Mur@@ ray Dor@@ sey - were used by K@@ u Klu@@ x Kl@@ an in 1946 .
no one ever was accused of mur@@ ders .
&quot; it is really in@@ conceivable that in all these years no single person was arrested - although we see them in our churches , although we know who they are , &quot; said Ty@@ rone Broo@@ ks , who is helping the organization of post@@ nat@@ al .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a stain on a story , but it is a burden for our souls . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Broo@@ ks is a 71 @-@ year @-@ old former con@@ gres@@ s@@ man of Georgia and a lifel@@ ong citizen .
it serves as a dramatic call to action and represents an annual reminder of the Mon@@ ro@@ e community that one injustice has never been corrected .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want criminal prosecution , we want to end , we want healing , we want reconciliation , but first we must obtain justice , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we cannot get to healing and reconciliation until we receive justice . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a court surgeon puts a sheet on the corp@@ se of one of the victims of the Mo@@ ore @-@ Ford @-@ Lyn@@ ching on 27 July 1946 .
according to FB@@ I files received by N@@ BC News , more than 50 men from Mon@@ ro@@ e and the surrounding coun@@ ties were suspected in the Lyn@@ ching process .
but no one ever was accused .
although the susp@@ ects remain free on foot for decades , civil rights activists say that the double motivation for Lyn@@ ch actions throughout the city has always been known : politics and sex .
in April 1946 , a decision by the Supreme Court of Justice allowed the black citizens in Georgia to vote for their vote for the first time in summer .
approximately at the same time as the election st@@ ach according to the FB@@ I of the black farmer Roger Mal@@ com a white land@@ owner , Bar@@ nett H@@ ester , down during a fight - allegedly because of a woman .
Broo@@ ks said that the rum@@ or in the city had been that H@@ ester slept with Mal@@ com@@ s wife Dor@@ othy and that the baby she wore didn &apos;t stem from her husband .
on 25 July 1946 , Lo@@ y Har@@ rison , a prominent white land@@ owner , paid $ 600 to liber@@ ate Mal@@ com from prison , like the FB@@ I .
he was accompanied by Dor@@ othy and her c@@ ous@@ ins Ma@@ e Mur@@ ray and George Dor@@ sey to prison .
but when they came from the prison and approached Mo@@ ore &apos;s Ford Bridge , a Lyn@@ ch@@ mo@@ b surrounded the car .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was Har@@ rison who prepared and ordered the mur@@ ders , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; concludes an FB@@ I report . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is also obvious that there was a conspiracy between state and local criminal prosecution that was not only involved in kill@@ ings , removing evidence and obsc@@ uring the identity of witnesses . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Broo@@ ks still formul@@ ates it more conc@@ ise .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was an electoral law massacre , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; they were all killed to send a message to black people in this community : &quot; if you let yourself be registered and if you vote , it will happen here . &quot;
for almost a decade , Cass@@ andra Gre@@ ene has conducted the annual delivery of Mo@@ ore Ford Bridge Lyn@@ ch @-@ Mor@@ de .
her presentation is illustr@@ ative , po@@ ign@@ ant , and is based in a kind of deep rac@@ ism , many of whom want to believe that he no longer exists in America .
it &apos;s hard to watch , and still harder to look away , but Gre@@ ene said that this is the point .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we don &apos;t want to talk about the ly@@ n@@ ching because we are confronted with its ug@@ liness in all of us , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I can &apos;t build a relationship with you if you don &apos;t want to listen to me or don &apos;t want to hear what I &apos;ve been through . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
rehear@@ s@@ als for this year &apos;s production began in June , and on the first day almost 30 actors - a dozen wh@@ ites and the rest of the bl@@ acks - went into a room and listened as Gre@@ ene started a well @-@ rehear@@ sed overview of the piece .
W@@ ade Mar@@ bau@@ gh is a Gre@@ enes Co @-@ director .
he has played the role of chief clan member for years , but he said the role will never be easier .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I feel dirty because I &apos;m not that , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mar@@ bau@@ gh . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I think it &apos;s very important to keep this story alive because we don &apos;t want to return to these times . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the other side of the room , actor Dar@@ rius Brad@@ sha@@ w and Nick Ras@@ cona , who play Roger Mal@@ col@@ m and Bar@@ nett H@@ ester , rehear@@ sed their lines .
the piece begins with Mal@@ col@@ m , the priest cries out and push@@ es him , fur@@ i@@ ously , that he slept with his wife Dor@@ othy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I said n --- he , disappear from my property ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ras@@ cona responds to the fire .
there is a break .
and then everyone ( at least all black actors ) breaks out in laughter .
Gre@@ ene laughs at the lou@@ dest .
&quot; what ? ! , &quot; said Ras@@ cona .
he is al@@ armed and confused .
was I too hard ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gre@@ ene , still ch@@ ick @-@ hear@@ ted . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I just don &apos;t think that white people were &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; n --- he &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yes , one of the other black performers wit@@ s . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; you only have to hit the tough one . &quot;
and exactly there the energy shifts in space , a feeling of compan@@ i@@ onship replaces the un@@ eas@@ iness .
everyone is busy getting this right , not just because of the game , but also because of the memory of the four killed people .
the scene again starts again .
this time , when Ras@@ cona says the N word , he says it sharply and with im@@ print .
absolutely no one laughs .
this repetition ends non@@ violent and fast .
there are cries , shots and then silence .
a woman clothed with a mour@@ n@@ ful dress stands above the bodies of the actors and leads Bil@@ lie Holidays in mourning &quot; St@@ range Fruit . &quot;
her voice breaks with every second word .
about a hundred meters behind it a group of about four dozen audience wi@@ pes sweat and tears from the eyes .
the audience is divided almost evenly between black and white .
a couple is coming from I@@ th@@ aca , New York , to see the performance , many come down only down the street .
they have experienced almost eight hours of Geor@@ gi@@ as oppres@@ sive humidity when Broo@@ ks leads them on a pilgrimage to the bur@@ ial places of the Mal@@ com@@ s and Dor@@ se@@ ys .
until this point , the mur@@ ders have remained an an@@ ec@@ d@@ ote , but now , if you stand in the same country where the ly@@ n@@ ch mur@@ ders took place , the air feels sp@@ ook@@ y .
when the last notes of the song sound , Gre@@ ene invites the crowd to come closer and inspect the dead bodies .
children sit in their heads , register the fake blood and the silent bodies and whis@@ per each other .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they are not really dead , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mur@@ m@@ bles a little boy as if he wanted to remember . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after a few minutes Gre@@ ene would like to thank the crowd - and suddenly it &apos;s over .
the actors throw the Lyn@@ ch@@ ord away and wipe off their tears .
Brad@@ sha@@ w hu@@ gs Mar@@ bau@@ gh , the man in the suit , who played the clan member .
Nick Ras@@ mus embra@@ ces two of his fellow players and then breaks together in their arms , the emotional load of the performance eventually breaks with him .
&quot; it &apos;s okay , &quot; one of the women whis@@ pers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we know that this is not in your heart . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you did that for a reason . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
later the audience sat together with the actors for dinner .
at one table a white couple from Atlanta chat@@ ted about the post @-@ position with a black pair they have just met .
Den@@ ise Du@@ pl@@ in@@ sky was struggling to find words that had left the feeling of the performance .
&quot; it &apos;s hard to hear these terrible words and deeds ... coming from people who look like you and do that because they look like you , &quot; she said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what this really does with me makes me believe that the ly@@ n@@ ching is still going on , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she added , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today this is called only police shooting . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the same room Ty@@ rone &apos;s yard keeps on his table , he eats and rec@@ alls the civil rights .
he said he had already begun to plan the performance next year .
&quot; the reproduction is in a certain way inspiring , as it describes the hor@@ r@@ ors of what we have endu@@ red , but it is also a moment of learning , &quot; he said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is like we learn nothing from it , then it can happen again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
whoever does not study his own history , who doesn &apos;t know his own history , is condemned to repeat them . &quot;
&quot; Göt@@ ter@@ dämm@@ erung &quot; reconc@@ iled Wagner &apos;s people to Bay@@ reuth
also in the fourth part of Richard Wagner &apos;s monumental work , director Frank Cast@@ orf presents a colorful @-@ fri@@ vol@@ e st@@ aging in front of a gigantic six @-@ storey backdrop .
the revol@@ ving stage ( designed by Alek@@ sand@@ ar D@@ EN@@ IC ) shows either a sh@@ aded street corner with wall rest and D@@ ön@@ er@@ bu@@ de in Berlin , a &quot; Pla@@ ste and E@@ la@@ ste &quot; logo of G@@ DR times or the New York Stock Exchange .
in front of it , an open Mercedes classic car , in which the Rhine @-@ savers pose as rock @-@ energy , or alternatively an Is@@ etta .
st@@ owed oil barrels remind of Cast@@ or@@ fs leit@@ motif - money , power and gre@@ ed - which moves through its &quot; Ring &quot; st@@ aging .
the three Rhine daughters - sung by Steph@@ anie Hou@@ tz@@ eel , Wi@@ eb@@ ke Leh@@ m@@ ku@@ hl and Alexandra St@@ einer - harmon@@ ize beautifully as in the &quot; Rhein@@ gold &quot; .
K@@ ES@@ S seduc@@ es Siegfried ( Stefan Vin@@ ke ) , breaking a corp@@ se into the trunk in Hollywood @-@ style and giving the Kra@@ wall@@ o @-@ Cli@@ que .
Stephen Mill@@ ing sings the wonderfully fi@@ ery Ha@@ gen that surrounds the aura of a heav@@ y@@ weight boxing .
brutal the scene when he sm@@ iles Siegfried .
later Gun@@ ther ( Markus O@@ ak ) still has to believe in it .
the audience thank@@ ed the ensemble with strong applause .
Fo@@ ster , Mill@@ ing , Vin@@ ke and Con@@ duc@@ tor Jan@@ owski , who mo@@ dest@@ ly bow their hands to Merkel @-@ Rau@@ te , will be celebrated in a stor@@ my way .
there is great applause for the Festival Orchestra , which shows itself on stage for the first time - given the great heat again in casual leisure at@@ tire .
the performance was expected by Frank Cast@@ orf and his team of directors .
in 2013 , he had to let go of a bell concert for himself , five years later , there was great rejo@@ icing in which the isolated &quot; bu@@ h &quot; calls went down .
Fest@@ spiel@@ ch@@ ef@@ in Katharina Wagner is happy about this .
&quot; you realize that the audience has grown together with the &quot; Ring &quot; in a certain way , &quot; she said shortly before the performance of d@@ pa .
the audience did not only make a form of peace with Cast@@ orf , but it was also an understanding of its view .
I draw a positive ré@@ sum@@ é .
Max amount works as a volunteer
they work in several places in their volunteer year .
where everywhere ?
quantity : usually in st@@ einf@@ urt in the furniture market , once a week I will help here in Gre@@ ven in the furniture bridge .
and I also worked at the school in the open whole day .
what are your experiences with this ?
quantity : it is a beautiful , wide spectrum that I see here .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have to deal with different people , with young people , with refugees , with young adults . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they are now 26 years , so a late @-@ time volunteer .
how does that come about ?
quantity : I did a high school diploma .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and then a civil engineer , we say , successfully broken off . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I know for myself that it &apos;s the wrong thing for me and I want to do something else with people .
and then I asked myself what are you doing .
a social year , there is an insight , there you can see how it is on the spot , in the focal point maybe , really .
and was it that way ?
crowd : I collected some great impressions .
I will start my studies in social life in the winter semester .
I will study dual , probably make a social worker training in Ju@@ gen@@ dam@@ t Her@@ ne and study at Ham@@ m at the university of applied sciences .
is it not unusual to have several different locations during the Vol@@ un@@ te@@ er Service ?
quantity : yes , it is very variable .
it probably depends on where you are doing your FS@@ J .
it can be done from Alter@@ sheim to youth work - in all possible facets of social work .
with me it was very varied .
I was partly in the O@@ GS , so in the afternoon care .
for me it was just the right thing that irrit@@ ated me .
I could see my own strengths and see how it really runs out .
unlike in civil engineering studies ?
quantity : well , here it is not a matter of calculating St@@ ati@@ ken .
there are always other people in front of the head who each have a different story behind them .
whether a refugee or a youth who has been taken out of the family - one must always deal with it individually .
very interesting .
and you had no reservations ?
quantity : I am not the guy for that .
it is an area that gives a lot .
a lot of love , a lot of kindness .
there are also negative moments , but life is just that .
Pear@@ son cuts further 3,000 jobs and pl@@ ung@@ es the dividend to revi@@ ve the business
the British education group Pear@@ son said on Friday that it will reduce additional 3,000 jobs and cut its intermediate dividend by 72 percent , as another restructuring programme will be launched to overcome the pressure that the company is facing .
the job cuts , which General Director John Fall@@ on mainly announced for the end of 2018 and early 2019 , will be added to his previous restructuring , where 4,000 jobs have already been lost .
Pear@@ son announced in May in a third cost reduction programme a cost reduction plan by another 300 million pounds ( $ 3@@ 94 million ) to revi@@ ve a business that was hit by the fast pace of digital learning .
the company , which had sold its stake in Pen@@ guin Rand@@ om House to the Ber@@ tel@@ smann partner last month , said that the outlook for the financial year was unchanged , having achieved an increase of 1 percent to 2.@@ 05 billion pounds in the first half of the year .
Kab@@ ul con@@ vo@@ y attack : NATO soldier killed in suicide attack
a suicide bom@@ ber attacked a military con@@ vo@@ y in the Afgh@@ an capital of Kab@@ ul , killed a NATO soldier and injured several others , says officials .
five soldiers and one interpreter were injured , announced an explanation by NATO .
according to un@@ confirmed local reports , three civilians died during the incident in the Q@@ ar@@ ag@@ h district .
the bombing is the last violent crime that Afghanistan has hit this month - more than 30 people were killed in a mos@@ que in Her@@ at on Tuesday .
on Monday , a suicide bom@@ ber killed two people near the Iraqi embassy in Kab@@ ul .
in a NATO statement it is said that the explosion on Thursday evening was to take place when a joint pat@@ rol with the Afgh@@ an army was attacked by an impro@@ vised explosive set by an army of people . &quot;
the statement states that all the injured are in a stable state and are treated at the B@@ agra@@ m air@@ field in the US military hospital .
correspon@@ dents say that the growing strength of the Tali@@ ban and the group known as the so @-@ called Islamic State ( IS ) in Q@@ ar@@ ag@@ h is a great concern for NATO troops in the nearby B@@ agra@@ m .
according to the United Nations , there were at least 1,@@ 6@@ 62 civilian fat@@ alities in Afghanistan in the first half of 2017 , about 20 % in the capital .
at the end of July , suicide bom@@ b@@ ings killed at least 30 people in a predominantly Shi@@ ite district of Kab@@ ul .
the Tali@@ ban said they had taken this attack .
on May 31 , a massive bombing in the centre of the city killed more than 150 people with the dead@@ liest milit@@ ant attack of the country , since the US @-@ led troops in 2001 forced the Tali@@ ban from power .
the violence under@@ lines the prec@@ arious security situation in Afghanistan , as US President Donald Tr@@ ump is considering increasing the number of U.S. troops supporting military and police in the country .
correspon@@ dents say that the suicide bom@@ b@@ ings in Kab@@ ul have also caused a crisis of public confidence in the government , their policies and especially in the call of President Ash@@ ra@@ f Gh@@ ani .
EPA Ret@@ ur@@ ns Dec@@ ision to Del@@ ay Smo@@ g Rule to Suppl@@ ements
the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has made a decision to delay a government regulation by Obama , under which states are obliged to contain the smo@@ g @-@ causing emissions . this took place one day after 15 states compl@@ ained to the agency because of the step .
the EPA announced late on Wednesday the decision to advance the so @-@ called &quot; o@@ zone rules 2015 , &quot; and said it shows the agency &apos;s commitment to cooperate with states .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we believe in dialogue with and because we respond to our state partners , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said EPA chief Scott P@@ ru@@ itt in an explanation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
P@@ ru@@ itt had announced the intention of EPA in June to assess the o@@ zone policy - in which emissions emissions should be measured in a part of the country in order to comply with stric@@ ter air quality standards - to delay a year by October 2018 .
a group of 15 most democratic states , along with the district of Colombia , filed suit on Tuesday and said that the effort was illegal .
the government of President Donald Tr@@ ump has tried to drive a wide range of environmental charges imposed by former President Barack Obama as part of a broader agenda that , according to Tr@@ ump , will boost economic growth .
however , efforts have triggered the set@@ backs of the Democrats and the nature conservation groups that are concerned about the impact of larger emissions on public health .
the EP@@ O website says that the inhal@@ ation of air containing o@@ zone can reduce lung function and strengthen respiratory symptoms , such as asthma .
common room wants common room
at the end the decision was clear : two counter@@ parts decided to establish a common room in the future retirement home .
before the discussion there is an important information : the purchase contract for the still missing land part is signed , reports Mayor Bernhard T@@ j@@ ades .
ad@@ mitt@@ edly , it will still be until the area belonging to the church community is in the community , but there is now no planning obstacle for the project to be st@@ em@@ ming from a private investor .
there is a discussion about a common room .
one of the two investors who are still in the boat offered to meet the community .
on the ground floor , it would provide a living space - about 55 square meters - and an adjacent terrace with an area of 70 square meters for a special price .
the administration and the majority of the Municipal Council pre@@ tend not to fores@@ ee such a common space as a meeting place only for the inhabitants of sen@@ i@@ or@@ ous living , but openly into the community .
for example , the word &quot; Stri@@ ck@@ cafe &quot; made the round .
the decision made by the provision of funds for the current budget has already been decided by funding opportunities already last autumn .
the building is in the renovation area .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the establishment of a common room , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said T@@ j@@ ades , with 60 percent of 30 percent &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the proposed decision is to signal the investor , that in this respect it does not want to throw a bil@@ le between the legs , the statement that both saddle - what is le@@ aning against the surrounding buildings - as well as pulse roof - would be possible to reduce the height and make the building more economical .
need@@ less to say , Wil@@ fried Soh@@ mer doesn &apos;t mean this addition .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if it helps : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it will happen unanim@@ ously by the body . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it &apos;s not that easy with the common room .
Daniela &apos;s reputation refers to the many own buildings with which you do not advance quite well , but now you lean into the common room out of the window , she says : &quot; I am struggling with it . &quot;
Y@@ von@@ ne Sta@@ iger necessarily speaks for the common room - but absolutely against a municipal participation .
it sees behind it a cover@@ t subsi@@ dy to any already wealthy or even foreign investors .
this is not the case , because with the acquisition of the area there is no subsi@@ dy , but I get a real , in case of doubt market@@ able counter@@ value , is the opposite speech .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sta@@ zi@@ ers &apos;s request to appro@@ ve the proposed proposal finds three advoc@@ ates . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
so it remains with two opposing voices in the original program that Stefan H@@ aller summari@@ zes : &quot; if we take the decision in such a way , we make a giant step towards closing a huge gap in our infrastructure . &quot;
collision with car : cycl@@ ist is hur@@ led on the road

FC Bayern Munich must abst@@ ain from the Super@@ cup against Bor@@ ussi@@ a Dortmund on David Al@@ aba and Thi@@ ago
the Super@@ cup takes place without him : David Al@@ aba has to su@@ ck the game against Dortmund .
with staff worries the FC Bayern will travel to Dortmund for the first time of the new season .
seven professionals are missing the title defender in the Super@@ cup against the Cup winner .
in front of the Super@@ cup on Saturday ( 8 : 30 p.m. / ZDF and Euro@@ sport ) , staff at the German football record champion Bayern Munich are getting bigger and bigger .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; coach Carlo An@@ cel@@ otti must also do without the BV@@ B on David Al@@ aba . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this confirmed the Italian on Friday .
in addition , the min@@ ers Manuel Neu@@ er , James , Thi@@ ago , Jer@@ ome Bo@@ at@@ eng , Ar@@ j@@ en Rob@@ ben and Juan Bern@@ at are missing .
for the five defe@@ ats in the past six test games , An@@ cel@@ otti has made the physical condition and lack of balance in the game of his team .
&quot; we know that we are not in the best physical condition , &quot; said An@@ cel@@ otti , and added : &quot; the most important point is the balance in the team .
last but not least , this was not good . &quot;
but the 58 @-@ year @-@ old believes in an increase in performance in the first official mandatory field of the season .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; football is also tactics , strategy , personality and motivation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I have great confidence that my team shows these qualities .
the team is ready .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to play intellig@@ ently , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said An@@ cel@@ otti , who is expecting a &quot; difficult &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; game . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the du@@ el of the two German football heav@@ y@@ weights draws the fans under their spell .
the game is sold out with 8@@ 1,@@ 360 spectators , the German Football League ( DF@@ L ) announced on Friday .
walking in the resin from star to star
the nation &apos;s first &quot; Star@@ path &quot; shall arise in the Harz .
this is planned by the association Stern@@ warte St. Andre@@ as@@ berg .
there is a planetary route in Göttingen - since 2003 .
a &quot; star trail &quot; accommo@@ dates the need for information of many visitors .
it combines nature , science , movement and athle@@ tic performance .
the members want to place tables along the planned route and inform about stars and con@@ stell@@ ations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a first phase until 2018 , the association plans &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; well accessible installations at five to six locations &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Ober@@ har@@ z . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
inqu@@ ire St. Andre@@ as@@ berg , Braun@@ lage , Hoh@@ eg@@ ei@@ ß and Sie@@ ber .
the information on the panels should be completed by internet .
this is why a good mobile network reception plays a role in the selection of the site .
accessibility is also a criterion .
later the path to the Star Path is to be extended by train .
&quot; on the star trail , the viewers experience much worth knowing , for example about the physics of the individual stars , &quot; the association stated .
they also learned why stars would have different colors or why a star more light than another , although it is much further away .
in which con@@ stellation , I will also con@@ veys a selected star and when it is best to be seen .
the association has been running the highest observ@@ atory in northern Germany since 2014 in the mountain town of St. Andre@@ as@@ berg .
according to the Federal Office for Nature Conservation , the site in the middle of the Harz National Park is one of the six dark@@ est regions in Germany .
from there , the Mil@@ ky Way and even the Andro@@ med@@ a gal@@ axy with naked eye can be seen clearly .
in the university town of Göttingen , there have been something similar to the Plan@@ etary Trail on the initiative of the Planet@@ arium Göttingen Foundation since 2003 .
starting in front of Geb@@ har@@ ds Hotel in the Goe@@ the@@ alle@@ e , which forms the interior of our solar system , the Plan@@ etary Trail leads up to the H@@ ain@@ berg and the observ@@ atory - as well as an &quot; ex@@ tr@@ ater@@ restrial &quot; site in Di@@ em@@ arden ( municipality of Glei@@ chen ) with the planet Sed@@ na .
the stel@@ ae with the individual planets - including the Plu@@ to , degra@@ ded to the d@@ warf planet - are positioned exactly at the distance and scale of one to two billion .
the earth shr@@ inks to a sphere of 6.5 milli@@ metres in diameter , while the exact 75 metre distance of the sun measures 70 centimet@@ res .
the entire distance of the planet is about four kilometres .
while the light from the sun up to the Plu@@ to requires approximately eight hours , pedestri@@ ans need a good hour up to the st@@ ele with Plu@@ to .
so , pedestri@@ ans are faster than the light in the universe .
the march to the next fix would take half a year .
Mi@@ key Gar@@ cia and Vas@@ yl Lom@@ ach@@ enko meet for the first time , discuss a possible show@@ down
Vas@@ yl Lom@@ ach@@ enko and Mi@@ key Gar@@ cia who were supposed to stand in a collision course to stage the most exciting boxing fight in the near future under 147 pounds met for the first time on Thursday .
they were in separate rooms at ES@@ PN offices in Los Angeles , to Gar@@ cia , the un@@ defeated World Bo@@ xing Council Light@@ weight champion , going down the hall to greet Lom@@ ach@@ enko , the World Bo@@ xing Organisation super @-@ fe@@ ather weight champion .
after Gar@@ cia &apos;s victory by unanim@@ ous vote on the former four @-@ divisions world champion Adri@@ en Bron@@ er on Saturday in Show@@ time , both fighters are members of the top five Po@@ und @-@ for Po@@ und list .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gar@@ cia stretched out his right hand and said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; How are you , champion ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I wish you a lot of luck . &quot;
Lom@@ ach@@ enko def@@ ends his belt against Miguel Mar@@ ri@@ aga on Saturday evening at 7 pm on ES@@ PN .
when the couple posed for photos , Lom@@ ach@@ enko @-@ Manager Eg@@ is Kli@@ mas noticed that a possible show@@ down between the fighters would be the &quot; perfect magnitude . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am a former fe@@ ather weight , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reminded Gar@@ cia . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I climbed up for Bron@@ er &#91; to 140 pounds &#93; , but I &apos;m not so big . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I am small for 140 .
I want to come down to light weight .
and he must move to light weight plates &#91; 135 pounds &#93; and then we fight .
that demands the fans .
let us give them this . &quot;
Lom@@ ach@@ enko agreed .
&quot; boxing needs this fight . &quot;
climate asked if it should be on pay @-@ per @-@ view , part of a strategy that Lom@@ ach@@ enko must fight with a 135 pound debut this year to arrange a date in the next summer with Gar@@ cia ( 37 @-@ 0 , 30 kno@@ ck@@ outs ) who also is interested in the fight against the winner of Jor@@ ge Lin@@ ares @-@ Luke Camp@@ bell following their lightweight title fight in the Forum on September 23 .
&quot; this fight could take place in pay @-@ per @-@ view mode , because all fans asked him , &quot; Gar@@ cia said , and later openly expressed himself to fight on the network that offers the best financial package .
we are the best .
no other names can generate this kind of attention .
whenever they are ready ... &quot;
Gar@@ cia said he treas@@ ured Lom@@ ach@@ enko as &quot; an enormous fighter , &quot; and he might take part in his Saturday battle .
but Lom@@ ach@@ enko held a generous praise for Gar@@ cia and said that he thinks the three combat champion from Ri@@ ver@@ side &quot; looks very slowly , I &apos;m sorry for Mi@@ key ... you wanted the Ko @-@ Aus . &quot;
Gar@@ cia said the focus was to show impact , then boxes .
both said they could feel the momentum that was built up for their own struggle .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the struggle that must be carried out . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
no other struggle creates so much attention and enthusiasm .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m more than happy to work on it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gar@@ cia . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Lom@@ ach@@ enko said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;ve been waiting for the top fighters , and that &apos;s Mi@@ key . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it will be a great battle . &quot;
four injured after tyre plat@@ ter
in an accident on the A@@ 7 , four persons were severely injured on Thursday afternoon .
after initial information , the driver of an Opel Za@@ fir@@ a lost control of his vehicle at 4.@@ 30 p.m. just before the on@@ set market .
the car hur@@ led to the right into the em@@ bank@@ ment , where he over@@ turned and then stood on the roof in the green stri@@ pe .
the four occup@@ ants - two adults and two children - were severely injured during the accident .
during the first provision of the injured by the ambul@@ ance service the A@@ 7 was locked in the direction north for about an hour , then traffic on the left lanes could be passed by the accident site .
For@@ tun@@ as Hoffmann : &quot; tri@@ chain works better &quot;
after 2 : 2 , and@@ re Hoffmann is hoping for the start of the season against Braunschweig that optim@@ ising the def@@ ences in Au@@ e points .
with the first season game Andr@@ e Hoffmann was happy with the result , too , if not the two ad@@ versaries were at 2 : 2 against Braunschweig .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these were too much for two opponents and we have to adapt better in Au@@ e , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the def@@ enders of Fort@@ una Düsseldorf . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the Or@@ e Mountains the tri@@ chain is to be further optimised .
and a gate after a free kick won &apos;t be able to capture the For@@ tun@@ as any more .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the future it will be the case that no one will stand alongside Michael ( R@@ ens@@ ing ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Hoffmann is convinced that his team is better able to cope with the three @-@ chain preparation as well as with the four chain .
&quot; I don &apos;t know how we will act in Au@@ e , &quot; says his coach Fried@@ helm Funk@@ el , but Hoffmann is confident of his business , &quot; because we are in the three chain at the half positions in Ka@@ an Ay@@ han and Ni@@ ko Gie@@ ß@@ el@@ mann , who can build up well , &quot; said Hoffmann .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the requirement is , however , that we harmon@@ ize even better and we do not make so many mistakes in building up . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
of course , Hoffmann also goes to Au@@ e to win the game .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but if you can speak after a mis@@ nom@@ er from a failed start , don &apos;t know . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the performance could be okay , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Hoffmann . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but if we stand with four points on Sunday and can focus on the cup , we will certainly be able to speak of a neat season op@@ ener . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his coach didn &apos;t want to know about it .
&quot; I judge the start of the season only after six to eight play@@ days , &quot; said Fried@@ helm Funk@@ el , who does not want to speak of an advantage over Au@@ e , just because the game of the Sax@@ ons in Hei@@ den@@ heim had to be stopped early because of a storm .
&quot; now they can start the season almost with a home game , &quot; said Funk@@ el and Hoffmann that the players from Au@@ e might even be a bit fres@@ her because they had no heavy and complete game like Fort@@ una against a favorite in the bones .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but they don &apos;t know as 100 percent where they are currently standing , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the interior defender of Fort@@ una . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the guests from the Rhin@@ eland present themselves as a light favourite on Sunday in the meeting at last ( almost ) finished stadium of Au@@ e .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that we swe@@ ep it away just because we have the right to go under the first six is non@@ sense , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Funk@@ el , whose balance is quite positive with only one defeat against Au@@ e out of nine games . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; there is no team in the 2nd Bundes@@ liga that you have to hit from the start , &quot; says For@@ tun@@ as Chief coach .
&quot; to make such a statement would be arrogan@@ t and arrogan@@ t . &quot;
and so Funk@@ el wants to experience his players on Sunday in no case .
new results of Swedish asylum application testing published
the recent results of tests for asylum seekers in Sweden , which have undergone a new method of medical evaluation of their age , show that more than 80 percent of the tested persons are older than 18 years . but not everyone believes in the accuracy of these results .
the Swedish authority for For@@ en@@ sic Medicine ( medic@@ in@@ al@@ verk@@ et ) commen@@ ced the tests last year .
during the asylum procedure , they should make more accurate the app@@ rais@@ al of the age after the Swedish Migration Service ( Migration C@@ ement ) was critici@@ zed for errors in ass@@ essing the correct age of some refugees who were minor .
until today , migration has been sent to 6,@@ 8@@ 80 cases and the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency has now published the results of a total of 2,@@ 4@@ 81 tests from mid @-@ March to 31 July 2017 .
ei@@ ghty percent ( 2002 ) were judged as 18 or older , while in another 25 cases the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency judged that the person was &quot; possibly 18 years or older . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in 4@@ 32 cases the conclusion was that the person &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; may be under 18 years old . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the tests are performed only in cases where the age of the person is questioned .
according to Johan Gö@@ ran@@ sson from the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency , the results are consistent over the past few months .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we don &apos;t see a big difference in the statistics of the past months , the numbers are fairly constant , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said to The Local magazine . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the high proportion of cases where the person has been assessed for over 18 years does not necessarily mean that the asylum seek@@ er has lied about his age .
in May the agency published the results of 5@@ 81 tests and said that there are 4@@ 42 cases that suggest that the examined person is 18 years or older . &quot;
when the paper Sv@@ ens@@ ka D@@ ag@@ bla@@ det examined the 5@@ 81 results published , she found out that in 24@@ 3 of these cases the person had frank@@ ly said that she was 18 years old this year .
the method of medical retirement , in which X @-@ rays of wisdom teeth and MRI images of knee joints are made , which are then analyzed by denti@@ sts and radi@@ ologists , has also been critic@@ ised in some areas .
a skep@@ tic is the endo@@ cr@@ in@@ ologist Claude Marcus of the Kar@@ ol@@ in@@ ska Institute whose work consists of ass@@ essing the biological maturity of people to see whether they went earlier or later than usually through pu@@ ber@@ ty .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I had reason to think about it and I don &apos;t think the type of measurement should be used . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
to judge the biological age in this way is very uncertain .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if we cannot say that , we shouldn &apos;t do as if we could , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said to the Metro . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Gö@@ ran@@ sson from the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency , however , defended the accuracy of the tests : &quot; in general , you can say that the risk of having a child as an adult is low .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the biggest risk is that if the person is under 18 , in this case , this is about 10 percent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
full in the Plan
the work on the three bridges of the highway 108 between Lau@@ ter@@ bach and Sch@@ ram@@ berg is proceeding well .
a seven @-@ ton@@ ne concrete section was installed on Wednesday at the bridge at the eastern outskirts of Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are very good at the time , it works great , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Rein@@ hold Lei@@ cht , Head of Construction at the Department of Road Engineering and Transport in the Regional Council of Freiburg . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in April the works began at the same time on all three refurb@@ ishment @-@ dependent bridges between Sch@@ ram@@ berg and Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
the end of the building is scheduled for October and Lei@@ cht is sure that the schedule will be respected .
the first bridge , coming from Sch@@ ram@@ berg , crosses the Tro@@ mb@@ ach .
it is a arch bridge made of concrete , covered with red Bun@@ ts@@ and@@ stein and has a total length of 4.@@ 80 metres .
it was built in 1900 .
like the other two bridges , it has now come into the years .
to ensure stability and road safety , the three structures are now thoroughly rehabil@@ itated .
the other two bridges lead over the Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
they are made of red Bun@@ ts@@ and@@ stein .
both were built in 1939 and are twelve , respectively 10,@@ 60 metres long .
the bridge at the entrance of Lau@@ ter@@ bach on Wednesday morning on the north side has a 1.@@ 30 meter wide and seven tons of heavy so @-@ called bridge cap .
this is an edge fixing that is also used as a way of operation .
a 2.@@ 20 @-@ metre wide bridge cap is to be used on Friday at the southern part of the bridge .
then the pedestrian walk@@ way is to take place .
the special thing about this is that these are finished parts , a patent of the Sch@@ ram@@ berger company Di@@ zw@@ o .
the other two bridges are already equipped with the patented bridge caps .
special finger@@ tip feeling has required laying of lines through the building in Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
because there is also a fibre @-@ optic cable to which many companies are connected .
the residents were informed about the project beforehand in advance of the work .
fish and cra@@ y@@ fish had to be f@@ ished .
for the bridges between the building yard and the collecting point towards Sch@@ ram@@ berg , traffic is regulated by a traffic light .
for the construction work on the bridge at the Lau@@ ter@@ bach village entrance , the road in the area of the bridge at the height of the hotels &quot; Tann@@ enhof &quot; and &quot; Seven Lin@@ den &quot; is fully closed .
the cost of the three frac@@ tions is 700 000 euros .
the whole is financed by the country .
Af@@ D in Ger@@ ol@@ stein : b@@ under protest with German potato salad
it is not so common that parties draw on a strand , but when it comes to the alternative for Germany ( Af@@ D ) , it comes together , which would otherwise be difficult to reconci@@ le .
the parties represented in the chal@@ k @-@ day volcanic Ei@@ fel ( CD@@ U , SPD , Grü@@ ne , F@@ DP , F@@ WG , Linke ) belong to a broad alliance , which on that day shows a peaceful flag , because the Af@@ D invites in the Ger@@ ol@@ st@@ einer Stad@@ thalle in R@@ ond@@ ell for &quot; big campaign opening . &quot;
and well @-@ known names to the start - like Alice Wei@@ der , who together with Alexander Gau@@ land forms the leading duo for the Bundestag election on September 24 , and the deputy Federal President Beat@@ rix of Stor@@ ch .
but those who are on site for hours before the start of the event don &apos;t want to listen to the Af@@ D @-@ lern , but demonstrate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the motto &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ei@@ fel remains colorful . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
originally the city picnic under the motto &quot; All at a table &quot; was planned at the fountain square , but now takes place on the parking below the fund - and thus right in front of those who come to the Af@@ D event in the Stad@@ thalle .
a colourful picture that is present .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and what Christ@@ a Kar@@ oli , Chair@@ woman of the Forum A World and one of the leading organisers , is really happy : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s great how many people came together here . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are music and lots of food , including a &quot; age @-@ German potato salad , which also the Af@@ D could eat easily , &quot; says the woman who brought him along .
the police have ordered a lot of officials from Ger@@ ol@@ stein , showing presence especially at the railway station , which is only a few metres away from the venues .
how did the Af@@ D actually come to Ger@@ ol@@ stein ?
Mario Hom@@ pes from the Af@@ D vul@@ gar was reported to have tried such an event and received the supplement .
the 45 @-@ year @-@ old from G@@ ön@@ ner@@ sdorf had asked in Dau@@ n first , but there was a cancellation because of the already built Lau@@ r@@ enti@@ us church there were not enough parking spaces available .
so now the R@@ ond@@ ell , Hom@@ pes is happy that &quot; we can have such a nice event here . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the good right of the people , the main thing , it remains peaceful . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is also done : around 20 o &apos;clock a band for entertainment at the rear seats , in the Stad@@ thalle several speakers , among them the Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate Af@@ D chairman Uwe Junge .
there are about 200 listeners in the hall , waiting to see that the top candidate for the Bundestag election , Alice Wei@@ der , and the deputy Federal President Beat@@ rix of Stor@@ ch keep their speeches .
the police presence remains unchanged , but so far the officials had a quiet evening .
the Af@@ D event takes a little more than an hour , the guests on the forec@@ our@@ t have a longer breath , but also there is time to clean up shortly after 21 : 00 p.m .
the police can cr@@ ush - no special incidents .
tro@@ mb@@ one meets trumpet
a re@@ union with the Wolf@@ acher Posa@@ uni@@ sten Freder@@ ic B@@ elli is available in the Has@@ la@@ cher monastery concerts tomorrow , Sunday at 8@@ pm in the monastery church .
together with the Bulgarian trumpet Mi@@ ros@@ lav Pet@@ kov , he gives a concert under the motto &quot; Black Sea meets Black Forest , &quot; or even &quot; Balkan folk &quot; meets classical German education with roots in brass music .
both solo@@ ists are winners and winners of numerous international competitions and have held positions in European top @-@ class orchest@@ ras .
thus Pet@@ kov &apos;s solo trump@@ eter is the renowned Concer@@ t@@ geb@@ ou@@ w Orchestra Amsterdam and Freder@@ ic B@@ elli is Sol@@ op@@ os@@ un of the SW@@ R Symphony Orchestra .
both unite the desire not only to exceed the borders on their instruments , but also to merge the boundaries of different genres .
Johann Sebastian Bach sounds like in a new outfit , Daniel Schn@@ y@@ ders &quot; World Music &quot; unites themselves with Bulgarian folklore , and in the piece &quot; Exchange Suite &quot; of the jazz @-@ op@@ ener N@@ ils W@@ ogram , classical , jazz and free playing become a fascinating piece of art .
this core of the program was first performed this spring with huge success in Freiburg .
the renowned composer N@@ ils W@@ ogram made it especially written for the two musicians and more : the Has@@ la@@ cher Klo@@ sterk@@ irche with its special acousti@@ cs is consciously involved in the concert .
Kri@@ sten Ste@@ wart talks about her bis@@ exu@@ ality
&quot; some people love grilled cheese and will eat it to the end of their lives .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I want to try everything , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kri@@ sten Ste@@ wart openly talks about her bis@@ exu@@ ality . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; once I bite into grilled cheese , I think : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Oh that was cool , what &apos;s coming next ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the most well @-@ known relationship of Hollywood stars was the &quot; T@@ wi@@ light &quot; colleague Robert P@@ att@@ inson , who ultimately dealt bitter@@ ly .
despite all this , the brun@@ ette act@@ ress ass@@ ures the &quot; Har@@ per &apos;s Ba@@ z@@ aar &quot; magazine : &quot; I was seriously in love with everyone I had so far .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or do you think I &apos;ve played it ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after her separation , Kri@@ sten has admitted that she is bis@@ exual : &quot; I have always lived and believed in du@@ alism .
so it has never been confused or hin@@ dered .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I never liked being taken seriously . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
she particularly suffered from &quot; B@@ ang Show@@ bi@@ z &quot; but in school , when she preferred to dress like a boy : &quot; not all girls are typical girls .
that really hurt me .
when I was eleven , the children told me that I would look like a boy .
I really felt attacked , frigh@@ tened and ashamed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now I look back and think : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; girls , be proud of you ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
especially the public don &apos;t like to explain their love life : &quot; people expect you to be in a certain way and that anno@@ ys me .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and perhaps some call me ung@@ rat@@ eful , but I don &apos;t like to justify myself from all the public . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
West Virginia Gover@@ nor announces that he changes the party
the Democratic governor of West Virginia , Jim Justice , announced Thursday evening in a demonstration with President Tr@@ ump that he would change the party .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; whether you like it or not , the democr@@ ats have removed from me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gover@@ nor Justice . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; today I will tell you with many prayers and a lot of re@@ thinking ... Today I will tell you as a resident of West Virginia , I can no longer help you if I am a democratic governor . &quot;
the manifestation broke out in Ju@@ bel .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tomorrow I will change my registration to the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; added Justice . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; as a trainer , I would say it &apos;s time to play another game . &quot;
Mr. Tr@@ ump previously promised a big announcement at the West Virginia Rallye .
Mr. Tr@@ ump won West Virginia with 42 points , and Justice did not endor@@ se H@@ illary Clinton &apos;s democratic nomin@@ ee .
justice , which according to For@@ bes is the only billi@@ on@@ aire in the state , was elected in 2016 .
For@@ bes finds that he owns coal mines in five states , and has inherited a coal business from his father .
it is worth about 1.@@ 59 billion dollars .
in the meantime , on Thursday evening , the Republi@@ can National Committee issued an explanation in which it said : &quot; the party change from Gover@@ nor Justice is another blow to a Democratic party which would rather prevent us from working to make our country great again . &quot;
&quot; with only 15 provinces and the control of the least legislative bodies in history , Gover@@ nor Justice &apos;s announcement is only the final rejection of a party which is from top to bottom without guidance and is unable to find a positive , influential message , &quot; said R@@ NC chairman Ron@@ na Mc@@ Daniel in an explanation to C@@ BS News .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Co@@ E pra@@ ises &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; honest &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Russian ap@@ ology for dop@@ ing sc@@ andal &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the global leader of athle@@ tics , Sebastian Co@@ e , praised on Thursday what he described as a blat@@ ant excuse from Russia to a dop@@ ing sc@@ andal , but he repeated that it was not the moment for the country to be included in the sport again .
Russian athle@@ tics boss D@@ mit@@ ry S@@ hy@@ lac@@ t@@ ine said during the IA@@ AF Congress on the eve of the athle@@ tics world championships that the exile of his country was correct and that he was determined to fight the dop@@ ing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m sorry for &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all athletes , who were cut off gold and silver med@@ als in competitions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
despite his comments , the IA@@ AF voted in favour of maintaining the ban imposed in November 2015 after a report by the World Anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency ( WA@@ DA ) found evidence of state @-@ sponsored dop@@ ing in Russia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I thought it was a very open answer today , a very honest presentation , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said IA@@ AF president Co@@ e the repor@@ ter . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the entire Council and the entire Congress were delighted that the Russian Federation has recognized by itself that it has experienced some pretty hot times and will do everything possible to ensure that the Federation is resh@@ aped . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Co@@ E said he was &quot; delighted &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that Russia accepts the criteria for its re@@ introduction . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I think it was a very constructive day and I think progress has been made , but Congress supports the recommendations of Task Force that this is not the moment to re@@ use Russia , &quot; Co@@ e said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have to do everything in the coming months to norm@@ alize this situation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the guiding principle was always that we wanted to separate the clean ath@@ lete from the de@@ pra@@ ved system , &quot; he added
ninet@@ een Russian athletes will compete in the Ath@@ le@@ tics World Championships starting on Friday in London , according to the strict IA@@ AF criteria as neutral players .
the head of the IA@@ AF @-@ Task Force , R@@ une Ander@@ sen , said on Monday that Russia must meet some of the criteria for rein@@ statement .
drug tests are still inadequate and forbidden trainers are still free , said repor@@ ters in London after a lecture at the IA@@ AF Council .
tragedy for soldiers cut off in Mali
at a funeral service in the north @-@ h@@ ess@@ ische Frit@@ z@@ lar , around 1000 people of the two have thought about the fall of a helicopter crash in Mali .
the ceremony took place on Thursday in the cathedral city under high security precau@@ tions .
Secretary of Defense Ursul@@ a von der Le@@ yen ( CD@@ U ) said nothing about the un@@ explained fall of the crash .
they described the two revers@@ ed pilots as &quot; cor@@ don@@ ators of their expertise . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we bow down to this highest sacrifice made in the name of the Federal Republic of Germany , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she explained . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the 33 @-@ year @-@ old Major and the 47 @-@ year @-@ old Stab@@ sh@@ aup@@ t@@ mann from Nord@@ h@@ essen had died on Wednesday a week ago in the West African Mali .
their coff@@ ins were transferred to Germany and on Thursday accompanied by a dead guard of the Bundes@@ wehr into the Frit@@ z@@ lar@@ er Dom Sankt Peter .
at noon , only the relatives in the church took leave .
after that , the funeral service began in the circle of the family , the closest friends , representatives of the Bundes@@ wehr and politics .
among them were H@@ esse &apos;s Prime Minister Volker Bou@@ ff@@ ier ( CD@@ U ) and the General In@@ spec@@ tor of the Bundes@@ wehr Volker Wi@@ ek@@ er .
the mour@@ ners laid down roses , the relatives stood arm in arm at the coff@@ ins .
in front of the church Frit@@ z@@ lar@@ er and numerous soldiers followed the ceremony on a screen .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Minister of Defense of the Le@@ yen described the in@@ verse soldiers as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; highly decorated &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Stab@@ s@@ aup@@ t@@ mann set up the flight operation of the fighter helicopter tiger in Frit@@ z@@ lar and was one of the first six trained tig@@ ers of his regi@@ ment .
Volker Bau@@ ers@@ ak@@ h , commander of the regi@@ ment , to which the soldiers belong , declared : &quot; if this occupation could not turn off the crash , nobody would have liked it . &quot;
doubts about the UN mission in Mali did not show the Minister of Le@@ yen : the deployment is dangerous .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but he is also of great importance &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for a country from which we are separated only by two states , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the funeral , the coff@@ ins were brought out of the cathedral .
when and where they are buried , the Bundes@@ wehr did not provide any information .
Prince Hen@@ rik does not want a grave next to his wife
the man of the Danish Queen Mar@@ gre@@ the ( 77 ) , Prince Hen@@ rik ( 83 ) , does not want to be buried next to his wife after his death .
this shared the Royal House on Thursday .
the Danish royal couple is traditionally buried in the Ros@@ kil@@ de cathedral .
the sculptor Bj@@ ør@@ n N@@ ør@@ ga@@ ard already made a sar@@ cop@@ hag@@ us for the two .
the Queen agreed with her husband &apos;s decision , she said further in the message .
where Prince Hen@@ rik is buried , is still unclear .
but he did not intend to be buried in his French homeland .
Prince Hen@@ rik had never made a secret that he was not happy with his title .
after the accession of his wife Mar@@ gre@@ the in 1972 , he would have liked to become a king .
he retired in 2016 and also covers the title &quot; prin@@ c@@ lei@@ su@@ p . &quot;
since Hen@@ rik in Denmark did not get the title and function he wanted , he did not see himself equal to his wife - not after death , L@@ ene Bal@@ le@@ by said , the chief speaker of the Danish royal house .
where the last resting @-@ place of the 83 @-@ year @-@ old will ultimately be , is still unclear .
but he did not intend to be buried in his French homeland , but in Denmark .
he likes the country he worked for over the last 50 years .
Henri de Labor@@ de de Mon@@ pe@@ z@@ at , son of a French no@@ bility , met Mar@@ gre@@ the in London in 1965 .
on the Th@@ ames , he worked in the French embassy .
while his later wife saw the popular sympath@@ ies of the people , Prince Hen@@ rik had a heavy standing in the Dan@@ es in his almost 50 @-@ year reign .
in an auto@@ biography , Hen@@ rik wrote about the first years in Denmark : &quot; a few months after my arrival everything I did was critici@@ zed .
my Danish was wa@@ vering , I preferred wine instead of beer , silk stum@@ ps instead of kn@@ itting so@@ cks , Cit@@ ro@@ ë@@ n instead of Volvo , tennis instead of football .
even for the Gau@@ lo@@ ises , which I smoked instead of Virginia tobacco and had the reputation in this country to be the brand of socio @-@ critical intellec@@ tuals , I could not hope for indul@@ gence .
I was different .
I seemed to be happy with this position and not ashamed .
these were two mistakes ! &quot;
Prime Minister Wei@@ l wants rapid re @-@ election
CD@@ U and F@@ DP before possible majority in Lower Saxony
Dutch Prime Minister Stephan Wei@@ l ( SPD ) is after the loss of the red @-@ green government majority for a quick re @-@ election of the country , but he does not want to res@@ ign .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because on Friday the resolution of the Parliament was pronounced . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
prior to that , the surprising withdrawal of a Gre@@ ens de@@ pu@@ ties from their Land@@ tag fraction in Lower Saxony had over@@ thrown the government of Prime Minister Stephan Wei@@ l ( SPD ) in a severe crisis .
five months before the official date of the Sunday election , the red @-@ green coalition in Hanover lost its scar@@ ce one @-@ vote majority in the Parliament to the opposition from CD@@ U and F@@ DP .
the former Green MP El@@ ke T@@ westen combined their step with the non nom@@ ination for the 2018 election in their constitu@@ ency in Rot@@ enburg ( Wü@@ mme ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I see my political future in the CD@@ U , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she explained on Friday in Hanover . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; CD@@ U Group leader Bj@@ ör@@ n Th@@ ur@@ ler wants his faction to accept it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
with it , CD@@ U and F@@ DP had 69 seats in the Lower Saxony Land@@ tag , SPD and Gre@@ ens 68 seats .
so far the relationship was revers@@ ed .
the new Land@@ tag will be elected regularly on January 14 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Th@@ ur@@ ists said that the red @-@ green state government must now decide whether it can continue to go@@ vern in this situation without a majority . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Stephan Wei@@ l , however , holds it indispensable for the country &apos;s parliament to decide on its own self @-@ resolution as soon as possible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the CD@@ U Group is expected to decide on further action on Tuesday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the state constitution also fores@@ ees the possibility that the State Parliament withdraw@@ s trust and chooses a successor to the Prime Minister .
&quot; our Constitution provides several options .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these options must be judi@@ ci@@ ally clean@@ sed , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Th@@ ur@@ ler . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one will discuss all questions in peace if they are legally reasonable . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Th@@ ur@@ ger called T@@ Western &apos;s step &quot; something strange . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the politi@@ cian himself stressed : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am not a tra@@ itor . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I feel very good . &quot;
she described herself as a tra@@ itor of black @-@ green .
the Gre@@ ens demanded the back@@ sliding de@@ pu@@ ties to return their coun@@ try@@ men &apos;s mandate .
&quot; of course , we assume that they have immediate effect on their land policy , which they received via the green national list , &quot; said the president Met@@ a Jan@@ ssen @-@ Ku@@ cz and Stefan Kör@@ ner .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Group president of the Green An@@ ja P@@ iel said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we greatly regret the decision of El@@ ke T@@ westen &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she has deliberately decided not to lead an pron@@ unciation in the Group . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; even against the background that there were no content differences , we cannot comprehend this step . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
SPD Chancellor candidate Martin Schulz condem@@ ns the transition of El@@ ke T@@ v@@ est to the CD@@ U as a betra@@ yal by Lower Saxony &apos;s Gre@@ ens Demo@@ crat MEPs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the behaviour of the former Green parliam@@ ent@@ arians in Lower Saxony is not only betra@@ yal of voters but also betra@@ yal of red @-@ green , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the President of the Socialists and Democrats on Friday on Facebook . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he supported the decision by Prime Minister Stephan Wei@@ l ( SPD ) to quickly re@@ select the country &apos;s day .
the Australia exit costs red @-@ green in Lower Saxony the majority .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the politi@@ cian &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in her latest vanity and in her fru@@ stration her personal interests before the well @-@ being of the country , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; critic@@ ised SPD Secretary @-@ General Hu@@ ber@@ tus Heil . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a sc@@ andal that the CD@@ U in Lower Saxony makes this dirty tri@@ vial game and tries to make it political capital . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Dutch CD@@ U group leader Bj@@ ör@@ n Th@@ ur@@ ler wants to recommend his de@@ pu@@ ties to take El@@ ke T@@ v@@ est into the CD@@ U .
the SPD leader of the SPD ( SPD ) in the Bundestag , Thomas Op@@ per@@ mann , designed T@@ ests to fal@@ si@@ fy the results of the 2013 Parliament election with a personal career .
at that time the CD@@ U was the strongest force in the SPD , SPD and Gre@@ ens had a very thin majority in the country &apos;s day .
agriculture minister in an interview - How do we protect ourselves from po@@ isons , Mr. Schmidt ?
Germany discusses the infected eggs .
how could the sc@@ andal happen ?
how can consumers protect themselves .
in an interview with the editorial network Germany ( R@@ ND ) , Minister of Agriculture , Christian Schmidt ( CS@@ U ) , talks and answers .
Schmidt : how can consumers protect themselves from contaminated eggs ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I can only encourage all consumers to watch the eggs in your fridge and check the stamp print . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the consumer protection portal www.@@ gro@@ war@@ n@@ ung@@ .de , the federal states provide the latest information about the affected eggs bat@@ ches .
affected eggs should be destroyed or returned .
even if , according to everything we currently know , a health threat is virtually impossible .
is Al@@ di now taking over the best possible crisis response - all eggs out of the offer - because the central role of the clari@@ fier is not really perceived by the Federal Minister of Economics ?
food security is the task of the federal states .
nevertheless my house has opened up immediately and has been in close contact with the authorities of the countries since the announcement of the dis@@ agreement of Germany .
all information and risk assessments are available for consumers .
just like the manufacturers , trade has to ensure that the products sold are market@@ able and harmless .
when eggs of the residual sugar content of 0.00@@ 5@@ mg / kg are exceeded , they are not able to transport .
un@@ polluted eggs can , however , be sold and consumed .
this time , not the factories are to blame .
are production plants and consumers sitting in the same boat ?
according to the state of knowledge , the production companies do not have an immediate fault .
on the contrary , they must expect economic damages due to the alleged illegal practices of service companies .
as always there are too few controllers in case of emergency .
is there a lack of staff only , or in the case of a conclu@@ sive jurisdiction ?
it was just the official controls that have uncovered the process .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , the truth also includes that food fraud and criminal energy can never be ruled out to 100 percent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is precisely because of this a consistent explanation of such events and the transfer to the public prosec@@ utor in cases where criminal off@@ ences can be provided is of decisive importance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have already made clear several times that I expect complete enlightenment from the responsible authorities . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
is regular al@@ er@@ mis@@ m really necessary for food sc@@ and@@ als ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; consumers have the right to get only safe and market@@ able food . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if a non @-@ approved insec@@ ti@@ cide is used in the food industry , consumers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; law &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
by means of the pan @-@ out means , manufacturers , traders and consumers are caught in a situation that is absolutely not necessary .
basically it must be clear that the un@@ lawful use of the insec@@ ti@@ cide Fi@@ pron@@ il in the attitude of food @-@ supplying animals is not acceptable and must be immediately terminated .
this has to be done consistently and with high pressure on all levels .
I expect from all the relevant authorities that the facts are quickly and completely clari@@ fied .
how the financial rules of football affect N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s move to Paris
the rules aimed at preventing un@@ hin@@ dered expendi@@ tures of European football clubs will not distur@@ b N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s world record transfer from Spanish Barcelona to the French Paris @-@ Saint Ger@@ main .
any consequences will come for Paris Saint @-@ Ger@@ main from the UEF@@ A , as the leading organization that monitors the European game has the power to ban teams from access to the prestigious Champions League tournament .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; financial fair play rules launched by UEF@@ A in 2011 mean that PS@@ G has to prove at some point that the transfer from N@@ ey@@ mar has been financed without major losses . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Barcelona has paid 2@@ 22 million euros ( $ 26@@ 2 million ) to extract Brazilian from its contract , and N@@ ey@@ mar will receive a salary which will amount to several tens of millions of dollars a year .
here are some of the financial aspects of N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s move to France .
PS@@ G can surely make money easy for N@@ ey@@ mar to sign and bring him to a gal@@ axy of other stars , given the funding of the team through the energy rich sovereign family of Qatar .
clubs are allowed to spend a lot of money on the purchase of players , but must be subject to legitimate sources of income that allow them to break even point in their business related business .
FF@@ P was designed by Michel Plat@@ ini after his election to the UEF@@ A president in 2007 .
the former French player thought that clubs , who had taken enormous debts in their quest for success , effectively che@@ ated and ris@@ ked to ruin themselves when banks or owners with@@ drew their support .
in 2011 FF@@ P shifted from focusing on the debt of the clubs to monitor their losses .
the change meant that the business model , the novel Abra@@ movi@@ ch originally used in 2003 in Chelsea - bought a club with potential and then invested heavily to improve the team and build a global brand - to become a tough@@ er matter .
during the current three @-@ year period of FF@@ P , which runs until 2018 , clubs may take losses of EUR 30 million .
and although Plat@@ ini has fallen away from the presi@@ dency in 2015 , his UEF@@ A successor Alek@@ s@@ ander C@@ efer@@ in continues to be deter@@ red by excessive spending .
&quot; surely FF@@ P is not dead and we will definitely strengthen the rules for the future , &quot; said Andrea Tra@@ ver@@ so , who is responsible for FF@@ P in UEF@@ A compared with The Associ@@ ated Press in the past week .
although the PS@@ G has paid the Buy @-@ out clause of N@@ ey@@ mar in a flat rate , it can distribute the amount for the invo@@ icing over the duration of his contract .
N@@ ey@@ mar has signed a five @-@ year contract , so that the dra@@ fts for the next five years in the amount of 4@@ 4.4 million euros can be accounted for in the annual financial statements .
the first wave of FF@@ P sanctions in 2014 met the PS@@ G along with Abu Dhabi , which is owned by Manchester City , with the tough@@ est sanctions .
the PS@@ G received a fine of 60 million euros ( at that time $ 82 million ) , which was later reduced to 20 million euros - and it was ordered that the team members for the Champions League of the 2014 / 15 season will be limited to 21 players instead of the usual 25 players .
UEF@@ A is looking for clubs that could try to out@@ wit their financial view by pin@@ pointing their revenue by companies associated with the owners of a club .
while a cat@@ astrop@@ hic company could sponsor the PS@@ G if the value of sponsor@@ ing should exceed the standard market rates , UEF@@ A would not count this as legitimate income .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was exactly what happened in 2014 when the UEF@@ A decided that the value of the sponsor of the P@@ SA was infl@@ ated by the Qatar Tourism Authority . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was reported that some of the PS@@ G payments on N@@ ey@@ mar could come to Qatar via payments from the Organ@@ izing Committee of the 2022 World Cup 2022 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but PS@@ G and Qatar have argued that N@@ ey@@ mar &apos;s World Cup amb@@ ass@@ adors are going to be and such a manoeu@@ vre for UEF@@ A regulatory authorities could be easily identified . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the previous sanctions against PS@@ G mean that UEF@@ A will be more attentive to ignore any attempt to circum@@ vent the rules . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the UEF@@ A had no prepar@@ atory talks with PS@@ G via N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s Transfer , said on Thursday the people who are familiar with the situation .
they spoke under the condition of anonym@@ ity with The Associ@@ ated Press , because they were not authorised to discuss the PS@@ G situation .
the last published reports show that PS@@ G 2015 / 16 has achieved a profit of more than 10 million euros with a turnover of € 54@@ 2.4 million .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the accounts for the last fiscal year have to be published . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
PS@@ G expects N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s to be a blessing for sponsor@@ ing deals , merchan@@ dis@@ ing and jer@@ sey sales .
the association assumes that sales will rise by at least 30 percent after signature .
the Spanish League was clearly irrit@@ ated to see one of the best football players and tried to prevent N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s away by claiming that PS@@ G would violate the FF@@ P .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a clear case of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; financing dop@@ ing &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the club and the state , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the President of the La League , J@@ avier T@@ eb@@ as , the Spanish daily AS with regard to Qatar &apos;s last owners . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
arsen@@ al @-@ Manager Arsen@@ e Wen@@ ger , whose club is owned by an American Sport Ty@@ co@@ on , shares the reservations of La League against a state that finances a club .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is the consequence of the ownership and that has completely changed the entire landscape of football in the last 15 years , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wen@@ ger said on Thursday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; once a country has an association , everything is possible . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is very difficult to respect the financial fair play because you can go different ways or have different interests when a country has such a big actor in order to represent a country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Swiss is looking for a new sho@@ ddy supplier
in recent years Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y board chocolate has produced chocolate for Swiss .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now the sweet cooperation is facing a possible end : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the airline is writing the order again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on request of the news agency S@@ DA , Swiss speakers Mei@@ ke Fu@@ hl@@ rott confirmed a corresponding report by the news agency S@@ DA on Friday .
according to current planning , the airline will conclude a new contract in the first half of 2018 .
the products were reviewed every two to three years and subjected to quality control .
&quot; we are very satisfied with the current supplier Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y , &quot; said the spokesperson .
approximately 17 million small red @-@ white wrapped chocolate bars distribute up to 14 grams a year before landing to the passengers .
Swiss did not want to provide any information about the costs .
industry insi@@ ders estimate the volume of orders in accordance with &quot; Nor@@ th@@ western Switzerland &quot; from 1.5 to 2 million Swiss francs - the Mig@@ ros subsidiary generates annual sales of around one billion Swiss francs .
but the advertising effect is more important once and for all : it is a prestigious order for a sho@@ oter manufacturer .
Swiss does not want to betra@@ y the number of applicants with the new tender .
but only Swiss manufacturers are concerned .
according to the newspaper article , Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y is trying to rev@@ ital@@ ise the Treaty establishing the Spring of 2018 .
for the S@@ DA , the biggest Swiss chocolate manufacturer was not available for an opinion .
Swiss Life has been distributing chocolate bars on board their flights since 2006 .
prior to signing a contract with Mig@@ ros subsidiary , Barry C@@ alle@@ baut has supplied chocolate tablets in collaboration with Hu@@ g .
the possibility to place the logo Swiss introduced two and a half years ago with the start of the cooperation with Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y .
the airline operates with different Swiss chocolate producers .
on long haul flights customers of the First Class are p@@ am@@ pered with treats from the confection@@ ery Spr@@ ün@@ gli , in Business Class the passengers Scho@@ ol@@ i von Lind@@ t and in Economy Class Sho@@ gg@@ i from Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y .
Swiss sho@@ gg@@ i by Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y , both in business and in Economy Class , distri@@ butes on the short circuit .

nostal@@ gia goes to &quot; W@@ et Hot American Summer &quot; and &quot; Com@@ rade Det@@ ective &quot;
this repetition of history is at the same time nostal@@ gic because of the glorious days of the characters of the 80 &apos;s , for the 90 @-@ year Gr@@ unge era ( when the think@@ ers David W@@ ain and Michael Show@@ alter played the Sk@@ etch @-@ comedy &quot; The State &quot; for M@@ TV ) , and for themselves - that is , for 2001 before their stars , like Elizabeth B@@ anks , A@@ my Po@@ eh@@ ler and Paul Ru@@ dd were going to bigger things .
as a cultural arti@@ fact , it is equally a par@@ ody and em@@ bodi@@ ment of our fac@@ ebook @-@ capable era of permanent memories .
but as fran@@ chise it feels like the time would scar@@ ce .
&quot; first Day of Camp &quot; worked surprisingly well , not only because of its absurd humour ( it contained an original story for a talking can of vegetables spoken by H. J@@ on Benjamin ) .
by placing themselves on the core of the G@@ ags - middle @-@ aged actors play hor@@ ny children that will grow - they still managed to win the last part of the W@@ itz@@ es .
&quot; ten Years L@@ ater , &quot; with his adults now playing adults , is less emotion@@ ally rooted and his par@@ ody is more based on the watering principle , including a reef on the Stal@@ ker films of the 90 &apos;s as &quot; The Hand That Ro@@ cks the C@@ rad@@ le . &quot;
at one point , a character drives through an Apple @-@ Power@@ book , some Inline Sk@@ ates and &quot; a number of other things from 1991 . &quot;
many of the central stories are the same .
the lovely C@@ oop ( Mr. Show@@ off ) , now Roman@@ aut , has not forgotten K@@ atie ( Mar@@ guer@@ ite Mor@@ eau ) .
Victor ( K@@ en Mar@@ ino ) still has not lost his vir@@ g@@ inity .
and there is another crazy malicious P@@ lot , included in the Ron@@ ald Re@@ ag@@ an ( also Mr. Show@@ alter ) , who is now supported by George H. W. Bush ( a good impression of Michael Ian Black ) .
as always , the ex@@ ams are the best part of fran@@ chise .
it is a lot of fun to see the etern@@ ally young Mr. Ru@@ dd , who shows Matt D@@ ill@@ ons &apos;s sub@@ li@@ pp@@ enb@@ art of &quot; Sing@@ les , &quot; whose former Big @-@ Man @-@ on @-@ Camp Andy feels like an old boy .
it &apos;s the moments of random ma@@ dness that could heat this fran@@ chise like a sort of repeti@@ tive &quot; Seven Up ! &quot; series until he achieves that which I consider his logical conclusion : &quot; wet Hot American Summer : Tw@@ enty Years L@@ ater , &quot; whose last scene will show the band premiere of &quot; W@@ et Hot American Summer . &quot;
&quot; Com@@ rade Det@@ ective &quot; on Amazon now rec@@ alls another kind of nostal@@ gia : the revival of the Cold War of &quot; The Americans , &quot; to the film &quot; Atom@@ ic Bl@@ onde , &quot; and even &quot; G@@ LO@@ W &quot; with its East @-@ West ring@@ ing icon@@ ography .
the comedy created by Brian Gat@@ ew@@ ood and Aless@@ andro Tan@@ aka is to be a found TV series : a Romanian drama of the eigh@@ ties with the two polic@@ emen as friends , two officers from Buchar@@ est who fight for truth , a@@ thei@@ sm and the road of Marxism @-@ Len@@ in@@ ism .
the main roles - a hard @-@ boiled Greg@@ or and an ide@@ alistic I@@ os@@ ef - are played by Flor@@ in Pier@@ sic J@@ r. and Corn@@ eli@@ u u@@ lic@@ i , whose di@@ alo@@ gues are syn@@ ced by Ch@@ anning Tat@@ um ( also an exec@@ utable producer ) and Joseph Gordon @-@ Lev@@ itt in English .
it &apos;s an ingeni@@ ous idea .
but it is not much more than an idea .
there are some nice days to watch ( the police spend the time watching chess on TV , as Americans might do with football ) .
and the list of famous speakers - including J@@ enny S@@ late , Nick Off@@ er@@ man , Mah@@ er@@ sh@@ ala Ali and Ch@@ lo@@ e Se@@ vi@@ gn@@ y - ensures a decent game &quot; Find out the voice . &quot;
but &quot; Com@@ rade Det@@ ective &quot; is very committed to the tru@@ th@@ fulness of a desperate propaganda drama - a mur@@ derer wearing a Re@@ ag@@ an mask is involved - that it often plays like a single .
with six long episodes it &apos;s moving , and the comedy is not fast or often enough .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Com@@ rade Det@@ ective , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; could better deliver its ag@@ it@@ pro@@ p sati@@ re because Greg@@ or and I@@ os@@ ef continue to visit the American embassy , whose lobby is always occupied by two thick men who dev@@ our a bunch of ham@@ bur@@ gers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the message for the imagined Communist crowd is that the Western culture can make everything to feed for a bal@@ lot .
the fic@@ ti@@ tious Romanian cre@@ ators were not wrong : we even do it with our own younger history and with theirs .
blow against drug ma@@ fia in the country
the police did a blow against the Italian ma@@ fia in Baden @-@ Württemberg .
on Wednesday morning , numerous objects were searched in the Black Forest Ba@@ ar District , in Rot@@ t@@ weil , Kon@@ stanz , Ess@@ lingen and Stuttgart , as the Public Prosecutor &apos;s Office announced on Friday .
15 accused were arrested between the ages of 25 and 77 and issued arrest warran@@ ts against them .
moreover , the officials assured large quantities of marijuana and co@@ ca@@ ine , fire@@ arms as well as several hundred thousand euros .
in the case of simultaneous ra@@ ids in Italy two persons were arrested .
there were German arrest warran@@ ts against the two susp@@ ects .
the two are probably shipped to Germany .
Italian and Bavarian investig@@ ators were involved in the campaign .
a total of more than 300 polic@@ emen were deployed .
the Ma@@ fia members are accused of organised crime crime , severe acts of violence , attempted murder as well as rob@@ ber@@ y and black@@ mail .
since summer 2016 , the public prosec@@ utor &apos;s office has established Con@@ stance against organised drug traffi@@ cking in Southern Germany .
there was a lively exchange between the public prosec@@ utor in Kon@@ stanz and Palermo and the investig@@ ators of the Kri@@ po Rot@@ t@@ weil had almost daily contact with their colleagues in Sicily .
therefore the big assignment was accompanied by four officials from Palermo on Wednesday morning .
the aim of the investigation was mainly Italian citizens with a close relationship with the Italian ma@@ fia .
also an incident on May 27 in Hü@@ fingen , where several shots were fired at a restaurant early in the morning , is likely to go to the bank account .
fashion compl@@ ains large gaps in the ali@@ ens register
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; data from citizens who should not emerge : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to a report , the foreigners &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; register shows considerable short@@ com@@ ings in Germany . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this leads to some serious mis@@ decisions concerning asylum procedures .
according to a media report , the commission@@ er for refugee management of the German government , Frank @-@ Jürgen Weise , drew attention to large gaps in the immigration centre register .
defici@@ encies in the data recorded there may lead to serious wrong decisions in the case of asylum procedures and deport@@ ations , in a cau@@ tionary manner in an analysis of the &quot; Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung . &quot;
according to the information , ten million people with foreign nationality are reported in the Register , including 5.@@ 7 million from non @-@ EU countries .
the data are therefore administered by approximately 600 foreign national authorities in Germany .
because the data had not been properly maintained , the quality of data in parts has not been good .
in individual cases , data from 1921 had been found , &quot; by people who are no longer alive , or of citizens who have become German citizens and are not supposed to appear in the Register any more . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; incorrect data entries can significantly slow return processes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the report . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in statistics on sufficient people , moreover , EU citizens are recognised who would not have to leave . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but such false accus@@ ations led &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to a distorted debate on how to deal with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; it is said in the analysis . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
meanwhile , the German government has obviously begun to return refugee families back to Italy with 16 @-@ year @-@ olds , if they have travelled from there .
it emerges from an internal paper of the Federal Office for Migration and Refu@@ ge@@ es ( BA@@ MF ) , reports the &quot; Neue O@@ sn@@ ab@@ rü@@ cker Zeitung . &quot;
according to the paper , &quot; BA@@ MF performs such procedures &quot; concerning families with children - with the exception of infants and small children - to Italy since 1 June 2017 . &quot;
since the end of 2014 , this was virtually no longer possible , so the newspaper was referring to the difficult situation on the spot .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the Dublin Agreement , refugees in the EU state are responsible for first reaching them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if a migrant is travelling to another EU country , the state can send it back to the immigration country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the office is now writing : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; meanwhile , the capacity for families with under@@ age children in Italy has increased substantially . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I have given guarantees for the reception and accommodation of families .
even the European Court of Human Rights ( ECH@@ R ) considers these commitments sufficient .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; other EU states would also return refugees back to the Dublin Agreement . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the women &apos;s political spokes@@ woman for the left @-@ wing group in the Bundestag , U@@ lla Jel@@ p@@ ke , critic@@ ised this decision : &quot; families with children are threatened because of the short@@ com@@ ings in the Italian asylum system human rights record conditions and a risk of child comfort . &quot;
second best result achieved
the blood donation service was already available to other people in 220 litres of blood of people living in Ober@@ rei@@ chen@@ bach .
at least from the twelve citizens who were honored on Friday .
first of all Jürgen Gre@@ ys , who with his 100 donations meanwhile divided 50 litres of blood .
traditionally , the congregation commen@@ ds multiple readiness to don@@ ate blood at the meeting of the Municipal Council .
&quot; it is ingeni@@ ous how our body is designed for it , and we pay tribute to the don@@ ors who make their blood available to strangers , nor un@@ sel@@ fish , &quot; stressed mayor Karl@@ h@@ ein@@ z K@@ ist@@ ner .
&quot; a single blood don@@ or helps several people , &quot; explained the District Church leader of the German Red Cross ( DR@@ K ) , Holger Mais@@ enb@@ acher , because the cann@@ ed are broken down into their components .
for example , three people could benefit from a blood donation .
at the same time , Mais@@ enb@@ acher reported about the actions carried out in the spring in Ober@@ rei@@ chen@@ bach .
&quot; this year we achieved the second best result with 114 don@@ ors , &quot; said the DR@@ K Regional Manager .
apparently the change to the theatre house has led to higher numbers of participants a few years ago .
before that Thomas Bo@@ ck@@ stadt , Susanne Reich@@ le , Sandra Schö@@ ck , Thomas Reich@@ le and Met@@ a transformed into the multiple don@@ ors and received 50 blood donations for each of them .
half as many as Herbert Ma@@ ir and Dor@@ o@@ thee Ri@@ ex@@ inger , while Tam@@ ara Pf@@ rom@@ mer , Petra Schle@@ eh , Stefanie St@@ oll and Uwe V@@ etter spend ten times each 500 milli@@ liters of their life @-@ juice .
the Bank of England will hold interest rates at 0.@@ 25 %
the Bank of England is expected to announce later that interest rates will remain unchanged after the weak economic growth and the weak@@ ening of inflation have damp@@ ened speculation on an increase .
the Bank of England warned that economic growth will remain &quot; slu@@ gg@@ ish &quot; when it held interest rates on family income in the midst of a growing pressure .
the political decision @-@ makers of the Monetary Committee ( M@@ PC ) of the Bank voted with 6 to 2 to hold interest rates to 0.@@ 25 % , with fewer members in this month , as weak economic growth weakened the support for an increase .
in its quarterly inflation forecast , the Bank reduced its growth forecasts for 2017 to 1.7 % and for 2018 to 1.6 % and warned that pressure would continue to rise to domestic income , with inflation expected to rise to just under 3 % in the autumn .
but she sign@@ alled that in the next few years interest increases would be necessary to raise the inflation of Bre@@ x@@ it and she said that credit costs would have to rise more than expected in the financial markets .
the members also agreed to withdraw part of the mamm@@ oth economic package issued a year after the Bre@@ x@@ it .
it will require time for the finance plan to provide cheaper financial resources for banks as of next February , although it was said that it is now expected that it will provide 15 billion pounds more within the scope of this system - with 115 billion pounds ster@@ ling .
the Bank said : &quot; in the central forecast of the M@@ PC , gross domestic product ( GDP ) remains weak at short notice , as the pressure on the real income of households continues to burden consumption . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the interest rates it repeated that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a certain tightening of monetary policy &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for cooling inflation and a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; somewhat larger &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; scale would be required than the markets expect . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the markets are currently forec@@ asting the first rise in the third quarter of the next year and another in 2020 .
however , the Bank stressed that elev@@ ations would be &quot; gradual &quot; and &quot; limited . &quot;
the Bank &apos;s growth forecasts for this year and next year are expected to rise in comparison to the 1.9 % and 1.7 % forecast in May .
it has retained its growth forecast to 1.8 % in 2018 .
the pound fell after these messages over the dollar and the euro .
the pound fell by 0.5 % to 1.@@ 31 US dollars and fell by 0.4 % to 1.@@ 11 euros .
the decision to no change comes after the recent dis@@ ap@@ pointing growth figures have damp@@ ened increasing expectations on interest rate and the GDP in the second quarter of 0.2 % has risen to 0.3 % in the previous three months .
growth is expected to be 0.3 % in the third quarter , although it will recover slightly after the end of the year .
the recent inflation forecast offered little enthusiasm for households that are affected by rising inflation and minor increases in wages , as the intensi@@ fication first becomes worse before it becomes better .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she added that monetary policy could not &quot; prevent &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; income ine@@ quality &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; but added that wages are &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; clearly &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the end of their three @-@ year forecast . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the economy is also boo@@ sted by the increasing demand for British goods , which is due to the weak Po@@ und , which will compensate for some of the lower consumption expenditure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the decision comes a year after the lowering of interest rates to 0.@@ 25 % in August following the sho@@ cking EU vote that caused the fall of the ground . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Bank estimates that it will likely take four years until this will fully reach the prices and the economy .
before the Bank &apos;s final verdict on interest rates , the call for interest rates increased , as inflation increased pressure on hard @-@ to @-@ push budgets , with three political decision @-@ makers demanding an increase of 0.5 % in July .
inflation decreased from 2.@@ 9 % in June to 2.6 % , although the Bank said this was expected and will attract them again in the coming months .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Bank said the excess in proportion to its target of 2 % was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; completely &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to the weak Po@@ und . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Andrew Mont@@ lake , Director at Cor@@ eco Mor@@ t@@ gage Bro@@ kers , said : &quot; in view of the recent fall in swap rates , the mort@@ gage market is likely to become more competitive again , as the credi@@ tors are looking lou@@ dly for businesses and want to end the year in a positive manner .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the market looks particularly good for those in which the existing deals are running out and the new mort@@ g@@ ages are completed , and many with toll @-@ free options and low rates are becoming more and more popular . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
N@@ HS ( National Health Service ) to prescri@@ be the controversial HIV drug 10,000 people
in September , patients will receive access to a &quot; trans@@ form@@ ative &quot; HIV prevention treatment after a fight against the High Court against the financing of the drug in the N@@ HS .
N@@ HS England announced that pre @-@ sexual pro@@ posi@@ tional pro@@ phyla@@ xis ( pre@@ p ) , which can reduce the risk of infection in high @-@ risk patients by around 86 percent , is now delivered by the health service via a first three @-@ year study for estimated 10,000 people .
he agreed to finance the trial after the Appe@@ als Court confirmed last year a ruling by the Supreme Court that the N@@ HS had the authority to pay for the pre@@ p despite the claim that the local authorities should finance it .
the move announced on Thursday was welcomed by N@@ HS UK boss Simon St@@ ev@@ ens as &quot; important new intervention , &quot; while the National Aids Trust ( NA@@ T ) described this as a &quot; decisive moment . &quot;
sexual health clinics in London , Bri@@ gh@@ ton , Manchester , Liverpool and She@@ ff@@ iel@@ d will be among the first to enable the registration of people and other clinics will follow in October before they will be introduced throughout England in April 2018 .
pre@@ text pro@@ phyla@@ xis ( pre@@ p ) is a result of HIV preparations taken before sex to reduce the risk of HIV infection .
studies have shown that pre@@ p has significantly reduced HIV transmission to infections at risk of infection .
pre@@ p prior to sexual intercourse means that just enough drugs are present in the body of a person to prevent an HIV infection .
such medications can be taken every day or so already two hours before sexual intercourse .
those who are eligible for treatment include gay or bis@@ exual men , trans@@ sexu@@ als and people with HIV @-@ positive partners who have not been treated successfully .
in clinics , suitable participants are identified who agree to the study , including men , women , trans@@ gen@@ ders and individuals who have a partner whose HIV status is not known to be controlled by anti@@ retro@@ viral treatment .
people living in England and registered with a family doctor may also register for a possible participation in their local participating sex clinic .
the program is signed £ 10 million and N@@ HS England signed a contract to supply the medicines this week after an international competitive procurement .
the study aims to assess the full potential of pre@@ p by collecting clinical evidence how it is used , recorded and implemented on a large scale .
St@@ ev@@ ens said : &quot; this great new intervention should complement and over@@ take the far @-@ reaching and increasingly successful efforts to prevent HIV .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is another milestone in more than three decades of continuing progress in cop@@ ing with one of mankind &apos;s greatest health challenges . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Deb@@ or@@ ah Gold , Chief Executive Officer at NA@@ T ( National Aids Trust ) said : &quot; this is a crucial moment in the fight against HIV .
pre@@ p , if targeted at vulnerable and vulnerable people , provides the opportunity to change the English HIV epide@@ mic .
from September onwards , people with high HIV risk will have access to this N@@ HS @-@ funded study in England to develop a new instrument that is truly individually controlled and not subject to a transaction with a partner , which leads to the improvement of many , many lives .
we warmly welcome this announcement . &quot;
Ian Green , Chief Executive Officer of the Terr@@ ence H@@ ig@@ gins Trust , said : &quot; the priority must now be to ensure that the study is carried out quickly across the country and that no one who has a risk for HIV is left behind .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now that the pre@@ p test medicine has been proc@@ ured , we are on the best way to protect more than 10,000 HIV infected people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Shar@@ on Ho@@ dg@@ son , Minister of Health , said : &quot; the start of the pre@@ p process is welcome and over@@ due after months of delay and hes@@ it@@ ant implementation by the government .
the evidence shows how trans@@ form@@ ative this drug may be part of our approach to HIV prevention and may end the transmission of this life @-@ changing infection .
this attempt brings us a step closer to understanding the advantages of pre@@ p .

Jo@@ anne Lei@@ gh , a former bank with a passion for real estate , shr@@ ank in 2014 from a big house in Kni@@ gh@@ ts@@ bridge to an Ear@@ ls Court apartment .
it is on the first floor of an elegant Queen Anne Terrace - and it is proof of the new design that Jo@@ anne has not packed her bags and sold her bags .
&quot; before that , I lived with my ex in Kni@@ gh@@ ts@@ bridge in a much larger room , &quot; Jo@@ anne says .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I sought something comparable to my price . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I was shown this apartment in Ear@@ ls Court , and it had the same high ceilings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I fell in love with them and made an offer this day . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
since the first inspection , the 1,000 square foot apartment was completely over@@ hau@@ led .
originally , a one @-@ bedroom property with a ne@@ sted layout - you had to go through the kitchen to get to the bedroom - wanted to add a lot of storage space and a mezzanine to make optimal use of the generous ceiling height .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I wanted high ceilings , large windows , lots of light . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
that was my requirement , &quot; she says .
for this purpose , she commissioned the Archit@@ ec@@ tural and Design Studio Du@@ ck &amp; Sh@@ ed from Er@@ fan Az@@ adi from Not@@ ting Hill to use 12.@@ 5 feet high ceilings and to create a home that was not only a development but also a place to live for Jo@@ anne .
the ceiling was not big enough to place two rooms above each other so that the architectural challenge was to create a mezzanine where one could stand .
Er@@ fan had to think cre@@ atively to solve the issue .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the steel works are quite complicated , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he explains . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we had to arrange the rooms so that they were stack@@ ed over each other without having to bend . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was not just about building a simple platform , but to put the steel in such a way that it had the right height for the function above or below . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this arrangement made it possible for Er@@ fan to place two rooms at full height - with much additional drama .
for the mezzanine a classic copper light window of Ret@@ rou@@ vi@@ us looks down over the gl@@ amor@@ ous living area .
mirr@@ ored gold furniture , silver accents and vintage Ser@@ ge Mou@@ ille illumination set the style for the program .
the use of mirrors plays a role in adding theater , space and light .
at both ends a short corridor is mirr@@ ored to make it seem longer .
in the kitchen the mirr@@ oring feels like a window in another room .
at the entrance , mirr@@ ored units offer space for all the cutlery and j@@ ars of Jo@@ anne .
through the perception of a gl@@ amor@@ ous space , the beauty of the living room can shut down the kitchen if it is not used .
folding kitchens are nothing new .
the special thing about this is that it is a garage door .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a bit of engineering art went in , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Er@@ fan from the steel @-@ reinforced , vene@@ ered MDF door . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is very important that when you push the door very easily slides . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
thanks to the clever use of space and storage space , Jo@@ anne was able to gain additional 16 m ² , an additional bedroom and an improved layout .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the end of the day , you will sell the land - or how your property is estimated , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Er@@ fan . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; in a ru@@ di@@ ment@@ ary form , a real estate agent will enter and perform a calculation based on the ground size . &quot;
here they have managed to enlarge the floor space and at the same time use high @-@ quality materials that give the room its luxurious advantage .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the materials are the things you touch and therefore help create an emotional bond in a home , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Er@@ fan . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you don &apos;t love the electrical sockets in the walls . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
these are important , but they don &apos;t play with your heart . &quot;
it shows that an apartment can be transformed by a good design and an increased square meter of some standard in something quite amazing .
in fact , like Jo@@ anne , you might decide to leave it .
brothers are fighting for a $ 500 million real estate empire
two brothers have been four decades after their Italian family founded the Dyn@@ asty , in a dispute over one of the largest real estate imperial Victori@@ as worth over $ 500 million .
the former director of the &apos; Carl@@ ton Football Club &apos; and developer Col@@ in De Lu@@ tis lives in a villa in To@@ or@@ ak , only three doors from his younger brother Paul . he has brought him to the Supreme Court to clarify how their property and their assets are to be divided .
Paul wanted to reti@@ re from the family business since 2014 , but a sharp conflict on separation takes place in the Supreme Court .
together with her mother Anna , the brothers have accumulated 38 properties worth more than half a billion dollars , since the 1973 family purchased a shop at Smith Street , Coll@@ ing@@ wood .
there , the West@@ co family founded jeans and grew to a chain of 160 retail stores .
it was sold in 1999 for 85 million US dollars .
this money was invested in real estate , and De Lu@@ tis &apos;s portfolio now includes offices in the city centre , the development areas of Br@@ uns@@ wick and Sor@@ ren@@ to , the apartments in Gold Coast and Mt Bul@@ ler as well as shopping centers in the suburbs .
after an agreement with her dec@@ eased father , Col@@ in - von Paul described as the &quot; main operator and the dominant personality &quot; in the De Lu@@ tis family - about two thirds of the company &apos;s assets and Paul about one third .
a court file states that this means that Col@@ in owns property worth $ 3@@ 16 million and Paul worth 176 million dollars .
the distribution of real estate and cash has proved to be a direct issue for Paul .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the det@@ ach@@ ments proposed by Col@@ in have left him with what I thought for the best objects , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he wrote in a first Aff@@ i@@ da@@ v@@ it in 2015 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
last Friday , after several failed negotiations , the first hearing of the Supreme Court took place .
the brothers now also fight for the control of the existing business - of which Col@@ in , as Paul claims , has excluded him .
Col@@ in ar@@ gues that this is not true , but proposes Paul to manage some possessions in@@ compet@@ ently .
in an early Aff@@ i@@ da@@ v@@ it , which was submitted by Col@@ in , he says he hopes to settle the dispute .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my Italian heritage stipul@@ ates that the family is the most important priority , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the costs increase in the case , with hundreds of pages with Aff@@ i@@ da@@ v@@ its , e @-@ mails and reports from companies , including Del@@ o@@ itte , Pit@@ cher Partners and Charter K@@ eck Cra@@ mer , and with leading lawyers , including Allan My@@ ers , Q@@ C , and from both sides held law firms .
Ms. De Lu@@ tis and her dec@@ eased husband Luigi were Italian immigrants who operated dairy bars and delic@@ at@@ essen shops in the late 1950 &quot; s and bought a business in Br@@ uns@@ wick in the early 1970 &apos;s .
they used the security to buy the Coll@@ ing@@ wood property in which Col@@ in opened the first jeans shop of the family .
Col@@ in says he started West co there when he was &quot; in my last years of High School when Paul was still a little child ( about 10 years old ) . &quot;
Anna De Lu@@ tis says that she and Luigi , who died in 2012 , hoped to share their property with kindness to their sons .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Luigi often told me that he never wanted the brothers to come to court , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
two other brothers , Mark and Luke , are no longer part of the De Lu@@ tis group of companies , and Col@@ in claims that Mark was paid $ 10 million and $ 26 million on leaving the company .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; both Luke and Mark were , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Paul says about the conditions of their financial separation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Col@@ in has with@@ held himself very much , although he was a former AF@@ L member of the AF@@ L and after a biography of 2015 by Ed@@ die Mc@@ Gu@@ ire the best friend of the TV star .
Fair@@ fax Media contacted Col@@ in and Paul De Lu@@ tis and their lawyers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; only Col@@ in responded by SMS to say &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I really can &apos;t say much , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because the case is before the courts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is very , very sad that my brother Paul decided to su@@ e me and draw our sur@@ name through the courts , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in mid @-@ 2016 , Col@@ in wrote in a letter to the court that he tried to fulfill his brother &apos;s demands .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our father did not want Paul and I to end up in our current fight , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; still hoping for a solution . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on Friday this hope seemed to be over .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our issue will be solved by the courts in the near future , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Col@@ in wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Tr@@ um@@ ps new chief of staff plans to limit the media abst@@ in@@ ence from the President .
others have tried and failed .
perhaps John F. Kel@@ ly can actually do it .
if so , he will be the first .
Politi@@ co reports that the new Chief of Staff of the White House is planning to restrict the flow of information to President Tr@@ ump , including news media reports - hoping to hold the boss on a more uniform course .
here is a piece by Repor@@ ter Jos@@ h D@@ aw@@ ning :
&quot; when John F. Kel@@ ly , the new Chief of Staff of the White House , met at his first working day with executive staff , he represented a major problem in President Donald Tr@@ um@@ ps White House , which he wanted to repair : poor information that has fallen into the hands of the President .
Kel@@ ly told the employees that information should flow about him - whether on paper or in brief@@ ings - because the president would make better decisions if he would receive good information . &quot;
Kell@@ ys diagnosis makes sense , but others have tried to t@@ ame tr@@ ump by monitoring his media diet .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; President Tr@@ um@@ ps relationship to television goes back decades - and now , where he is in the White House , his television advertising is still strong . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when candidate Tr@@ ump was angry for unfair reporting , it was productive to show him that he received fair reporting from jobs that were to be persu@@ aded , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said former election campaign advis@@ er Sam N@@ un@@ berg in February against Politi@@ co . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
politicians Tara Pal@@ mer@@ i wrote at the time that &quot; the key to keep Tr@@ um@@ ps Twitter habits under control , according to six ex @-@ election campaign officials , is to ensure that his personal media consumption includes a constant praise . &quot;
okay .
but the idea that Tr@@ um@@ ps &apos;s Twitter custom was ever &quot; under control &quot; is ridi@@ culous .
maybe these campaign officials know something we don &apos;t know - that tr@@ um@@ ps twe@@ ets would have even more combus@@ tible without their interventions .
we will probably never know anything about twe@@ ets that tr@@ ump did not send .
if his collabor@@ ators have managed to keep anger away from him several times , their efforts have been worthwhile .
but no one has consistently prevented Tr@@ ump &apos;s controversy .
part of the problem is that people in a White House , composed of competing parties , are constantly trying to present their own agenda by presenting a pump material that may promote their views from the world .
politi@@ co - busy with this story - reported in May about the preference of the advis@@ ers to supply question@@ able information to the president for strategic reasons .
this was an example described by repor@@ ters Sh@@ ane Gold@@ smith :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; current and former tr@@ ump officials say that Tr@@ ump can react like a volcano to negative press cli@@ pp@@ ings , especially those with humili@@ ating le@@ aks , and to find out where these originate from . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this was exactly what happened at the end of February when somebody mali@@ ci@@ ously gave a printed copy of an article from Got@@ News@@ .com , the website of the Internet provo@@ cat@@ e@@ urs Charles C. Johnson , who accused the deputy chief of staff K@@ atie Wal@@ sh , &quot; to be the source behind a pile of le@@ aks &quot; at the White House .
although Johnson was permanently ban@@ ished from Twitter for har@@ ass@@ ment or that he has not offered any concrete evidence , or that he has utter@@ ed false accus@@ ations in the past and re@@ vo@@ ke it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Tr@@ ump read the article and started asking people about Wal@@ sh . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Gold@@ macher added that the former chief of staff , Rein@@ ce Pri@@ eb@@ us and the Secretary @-@ General of the White House , Ro@@ b Por@@ ter , &quot; have tried to implement a system to manage and document the paper@@ work , the tr@@ ump gets . &quot;
how did that work ?
Kel@@ ly tries to do the same three months later .
perhaps he will prove to be more effective as a Pri@@ eb@@ us , but Tr@@ ump is still his im@@ pul@@ sive self , and his advis@@ ors still strive for influence .
these imm@@ utable factors make Kell@@ ys &apos;s mission very difficult .
most wanted criminals get post from Euro@@ pol
since the address is unknown , the help of the people is requested and hoped for .
the police all over Europe are sent out in this summer ( virtual ) postcards to dangerous criminals .
since the addresses of the sought @-@ after s@@ words are not known naturally , indications from the population will be raised and requested .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Euro@@ pol reported on Friday the action that follows the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; EU Most W@@ an@@ ted &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Advent calendar from winter . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the experiences have shown that many fle@@ eting away from holiday destinations , it was said by Euro@@ pol .
I have compiled 21 postcards for sought @-@ after criminals from 21 EU countries .
since 2016 the website www.@@ e@@ um@@ ost@@ wanted , more than 2.5 million copies , has been viewed .
36 of the online @-@ seekers have been arrested so far , at least eleven due to indications of the publication on the website .
travelers negotiate a dit@@ ch and return to the &apos; million@@ aire series &apos;
some of the weal@@ thi@@ est land@@ owners of the West Mid@@ lands are back with some determined travellers on the foot of the war , who have negotiated a tren@@ ch drawn up by the municipality to rec@@ laim a field in front of their man@@ ors .
the travelers have par@@ ked their 20 car@@ avans in a field outside a prosper@@ ous street of Soli@@ hull , which is called the &quot; million@@ aire series . &quot;
they have brought horses , babies and an army of transpor@@ ters after they had only been thrown out in May without being deter@@ red by a tren@@ ch dug by the Council to prevent their sei@@ zur@@ es .
the tac@@ t@@ ful group found a gap in the defense systems and pushed its vehicles through a section that remained un@@ hin@@ dered to find a way .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; angry residents have urged the Council of Soli@@ hull who said it &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; useless to deal with the problem . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
an anonymous inhabit@@ ant said : &quot; they went there on Monday evening after they were sent on by Bentley He@@ ath , where they threw stones on the pass@@ ers @-@ by .
the Council needs to be compelled by shame to implement it , since it was useless in dealing with the problem .
the travellers were there in May , were moved on and are back again .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; more came last night , probably even more today . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Birmingham Council knows how to deal with it by holding long brief@@ ings to protect its parks . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I live on Stre@@ ets@@ brook Road and I &apos;m not happy to continue to pay my charge if the Council can &apos;t stop it . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is ridi@@ culous , we just saw the last round of these travellers just to be pl@@ under@@ ed by another round . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the figures have increased this time and you even saw a horse in the park area . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a spokes@@ woman of Soli@@ hull said : &quot; we are aware of an un@@ authorised bearing on the country side of Stre@@ ets@@ brook Road and cooperate with the police of Soli@@ hull . we take the necessary legal steps to move them forward as quickly as possible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in order to support our collection of evidence , it is very important that as many residents as possible report an anti @-@ social or criminal behavior in the police by calling 101 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this contributes to creating a picture of the situation in which the court must examine when we present our case . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
from Bir@@ k@@ enhof is Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise
the Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise is from the former Hotel Bir@@ k@@ enhof .
the house in front of the gates of Freu@@ den@@ stadt is currently undergoing renovation and will be opened on 1 March next year .
these are good news for the city .
because with the closing of the Hotel Bir@@ k@@ enhof by the former Ambiente company gesellschaft mbH on April 13 , 2014 , around 30,000 overnight stays were lost per year and also income from the tourist tax .
in autumn 2014 , in view of dramatically increasing numbers of refugees arriving in the county , the hotel building was offered to the coun@@ cill@@ or as a collective accommodation , which caused controversial discussions .
the city prevented the housing of asylum seekers by setting up a building plan to secure the area as a hotel location .
the decision was not un@@ disputed at that time in the municipal council .
but above all Freu@@ den@@ stadt &apos;s Mayor Julian O@@ ss@@ wald defended the hotel location and at that time spoke of serious interested parties in the house .
he should be right .
the group of Lu@@ is@@ enh@@ otels with Managing Director Bir@@ git Sch@@ erer with headquarters in Bad Berg@@ z@@ ab@@ ern has acquired the former Hotel Bir@@ k@@ enhof during a voluntary auction in Berlin and wants to make it a house of the three @-@ star plus category under the name Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise .
the group has four houses with the Freu@@ den@@ stadt object .
two of them in Bad Berg@@ z@@ ab@@ ern and one in Bad Herren@@ al@@ b .
you are called Hotel Lu@@ ise , Lu@@ isen@@ park , Park@@ hotel Lu@@ ise and now Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise .
at the former Hotel Bir@@ k@@ enhof there have been building sh@@ utt@@ les in front of the entrance for quite some time and when you enter the house , it becomes clear how extensive renovation works are carried out .
the floors were torn out , ceilings partly broken down , old bath@@ tu@@ bs removed from the rooms .
the entire hotel building is a single construction site .
there is still much to do until March .
&quot; it &apos;s actually a lovely place , &quot; says Thomas Sch@@ erer in conversation with our newspaper .
everything is to be renewed in the Black Forest style .
the rooms are equipped with large walk @-@ in showers , the entrance area is re@@ designed , new windows are installed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; everything should be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nice bourgeois &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; later , as Thomas Sch@@ erer is expressing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to make a piece of jewellery . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
swimming pool , wellness area and conference room are part of the facilities .
you don &apos;t want to position yourself at the high level of the hotels in Lau@@ ter@@ bad , but already at a higher downtown level , Sch@@ erer emphas@@ ises .
the Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise with its 60 rooms is to be set up wide , Sch@@ erer explains .
individual vac@@ ation@@ ers , groups or business@@ men should feel comfortable in the hotel .
he has already had talks with O@@ B Julian O@@ ss@@ wald and tourism director Michael Kr@@ ause , as Sch@@ erer .
the performances of the city are identical to those of the hotel group .
&quot; we are on the same line . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the amount of investment required , Thomas Sch@@ erer doesn &apos;t want to define exactly . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he pays less than one million euros .
the outdoor spaces are also being brought forward , which is clearly visible .
in a courtyard , there is a large terrace , which will be accessible from the restaurant , which is open to the public .
Thomas Sch@@ erer is optim@@ istic : &quot; Freu@@ den@@ stadt is a good market . &quot;
Russia affair : U.S. Special En@@ lar@@ gement Beg@@ ins Grand Jury
in the Russia affair around US President Donald Tr@@ ump , special promot@@ er Robert Mu@@ eller should have used a so @-@ called Grand Jury after a report .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the body has taken up the work in recent weeks , wrote the &quot; Wall Street Journal &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on appeal to persons familiar with the matter . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the paper regarded the step as a sign that Mu@@ eller had expanded and intensified his investigations .
the broad@@ caster CN@@ N reported that there were already first events in connection with a meeting between Tr@@ um@@ ps &apos;s oldest son and a Russian lawyer .
U.S. intelligence services have been acc@@ using the Krem@@ lin for a long time to have pur@@ pos@@ ely interfer@@ ed with the 2016 presidential campaign .
Mu@@ eller was investigating whether there were agreements between Tr@@ um@@ ps election campaign team and Moscow .
the investigation will focus on several men who acted as advis@@ ors to the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans during the campaign .
according to reports Mu@@ eller also took a closer look at more and more tr@@ um@@ ps in a private and business environment .
the Washington Post , a few weeks ago , wrote that the special agent Tr@@ ump has personally moved to the center and for@@ ba@@ de the accus@@ ation whether the President might have imp@@ eded the judi@@ ci@@ ary in the course of the affair .
the main task of Grand Jury is to examine this evidence in possible crime cases and to decide whether an accus@@ ation is to be raised .
Grand Jury therefore also called anchor clips .
most of the time , they are turned on when it comes to larger and controversial cases .
the procedure is always done behind closed doors .
the Panel can also be turned on by the Public Prosecutor to invite individuals to perform under oath .
according to CN@@ N , invitations have already been issued which revol@@ ve around the encounter between Donald Tr@@ ump J@@ r. and a Russian lawyer .
people who were involved in the meeting had been invited to a statement , it was said in the report .
they should also provide documents .
besides Tr@@ ump J@@ r. also Tr@@ um@@ ps consultant and son @-@ in @-@ law J@@ ared K@@ ush@@ ner and his former election campaign manager Paul Man@@ a@@ fort also attended the conversation .
legal experts said on Thursday evening in US television that the introduction shows that Mu@@ eller should not be in@@ timi@@ dated in his work and that if necessary , he wanted to act quickly .
but it does not necessarily mean that the Grand Jury will be switched on at the end to decide on the collection of an indictment .
nevertheless , the establishment of the committee is the beginning of a new phase in the investigations and a new cause of concern for President Tr@@ ump .
in the midst of the new revelations , the President used a speech in West Virginia on Thursday evening to present the Russia affair as a campaign of his political opponents .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Russia &apos;s story is a total invention , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Tr@@ ump . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the subject gives the democr@@ ats an opportunity to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; feel good , because they have nothing else to talk about . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his special advisor , T@@ y Cob@@ b , stated in an opinion that he didn &apos;t know anything about the establishment of a Grand Jury .
but she usually works in secret , he stressed .
the White House supports any action that acceler@@ ates the work of the special agent in a fair way .
the former FB@@ I leader James Com@@ ey said three times that he was not determined against the president .
I have no reason to assume that something has changed in this way , but it was further explained in the explanation .
but Mu@@ eller had only been deployed after Tr@@ ump Com@@ ey had fired .
because of this ration@@ ale , accus@@ ations against Tr@@ ump have become lou@@ der , he did not want to obstruc@@ t justice .
Com@@ ey said in June before a Senate Committee , Tr@@ ump asked him to set up the investigations against former national security advis@@ er Michael Fl@@ yn@@ n .
the president is under great pressure because of the investigation .
after the presentation of US media , the White House collected material against the special agent and its staff .
this triggered spec@@ ulations on whether pump must be released .
unlike an independent special agent of the Congress , such as the Wat@@ erg@@ ate affair surrounding the later retired president Richard Ni@@ xon , Mu@@ eller has a position in which he could theoretically be fired at the beh@@ est of the President of the Ministry of Justice .
however , several sen@@ ators of both parties want to prevent such a step .
two groups of Republi@@ can and Democratic Sen@@ ators presented the draft bill on Thursday , after which the special agent couldn &apos;t be dismissed as easily .
Antar@@ cti@@ ca : gigantic ic@@ e@@ berg drives in Antar@@ cti@@ ca
in the western Antar@@ ctic , a gigantic ic@@ e@@ berg of the scar@@ ce size of Berlin was solved by the hor@@ ses@@ ho@@ e .
this was divided by the Bre@@ mer@@ ha@@ ven@@ er Alfred @-@ We@@ gener @-@ Institute for Polar and Marine Research on Wednesday .
the col@@ os@@ sal , weighing over a tri@@ l@@ lion , and 5@@ 800 square kilometres , now dri@@ fting north and will probably need two or three years until it has melted .
with a length of 175 kilometres and a width of up to 50 kilometers , it is one of the largest ice giant species that have registered in the past three decades .
there is no danger for people .
according to research data , the extent to which climate change plays a role in the demo@@ lition of the ic@@ e@@ berg has been unclear .
however , for some 30 years there have been a series of unusual break@@ through@@ s in the region , writes the U.S. research center for snow and ice ( NS@@ ID@@ C ) in a fac@@ tual background .
according to many researchers , this could be related to global warming .
the now broken col@@ os@@ sus has so far been part of the Lar@@ sen @-@ C ses@@ ho@@ e .
Sch@@ el@@ ice flo@@ ats on the sea and is fed by large glaci@@ ers .
it thus continues to grow into the sea and breaks regularly .
the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ bö@@ s is located south of South America almost at the top of the Antar@@ ctic Peninsula .
North of this cow@@ pe@@ e , the balance of wa@@ xes and abor@@ tions was disturbed some years ago .
A@@ WI researcher Daniela Jan@@ sen writes a complete shelf file .
there is some evidence that the Lar@@ sen C s@@ ap@@ se is in danger , as the front edge has never been so far withdrawn as at present .
in addition , the ice plate is under tension and can dis@@ integrate if a piece ab@@ rup@@ ts at a key place .
melting snow and ic@@ e@@ berg does not increase sea level as they float on the water and ice as much water as it results after melting .
however , the loss of the ice shelf means that the glaci@@ ers can flow directly into the sea and can flow much faster than before .
this could potentially raise sea level , but only in a small degree , the British research project writes for the observation of Antar@@ cti@@ ca ( Mi@@ das ) .
according to A@@ WI , the Lar@@ sen @-@ C ch@@ af@@ e is the fourth largest ice shelf in the Antar@@ ctic with almost 50 000 square kilometres .
at the transition from the mainland , it is up to 700 metres thick , at the front edge to the free ocean approximately 200 meters .
there it breaks regularly .
&quot; although it is a natural occurrence and we are not aware of any direct link to climate change , the ice shield now comes into a more dangerous position , &quot; said Martin O &apos;@@ L@@ ear@@ y of the British S@@ wan@@ sea University .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the longest retreat since the beginning of the records , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he also confirmed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
among scientists it is disputed whether the Lar@@ sen C Shel@@ f will now grow back or fall back in the long term and possibly coinci@@ de , said his colleague Adrian Lu@@ ck@@ man and added : &quot; our models say that it will be less stable . &quot;
but this development will take decades .
even though these scientists are not leading the dis@@ continuation of this gigantic ic@@ e@@ berg to climate change , many of the glaci@@ ers of the Antar@@ ctic Peninsula have crum@@ bled over the past decades .
this long top of Antar@@ cti@@ ca stretches towards South America .
according to the data of the Antar@@ ctic Survey , the Antar@@ ctic ice surface has decreased by 28 000 square kilometres since the 1950s .
the increase in temperature has contributed to the decline .
over the last 50 years , the Antar@@ ctic Peninsula was heated by around three degrees and thus t@@ amed to the areas where the temperature was the fastest .
CD@@ U wants to bring Hau@@ st@@ ari@@ f to the staff
because it is becoming increasingly difficult to fill vac@@ ant positions , the CD@@ U demands to withdraw from the employers &quot; association to become more attractive .
only shortly before the summer break , the circle @-@ day began 41 new jobs in administration .
more than 1100 employees and officials work for the district administration in M@@ ett@@ mann .
now 17 trainees have their first working day behind them .
the courses in the circle are obviously very sought @-@ after .
around 6@@ 20 applications were registered for the places to be allocated this year .
nevertheless , the circle is still missing in order to be able to handle the increased demands and tasks .
currently there are still 50 non @-@ occupied places at the M@@ ett@@ mann district .
among other things , we are looking for doctors and engineers as well as forces of general administration .
the CD@@ U wants to take the initiative together with the F@@ DP and the U@@ WG together with the U@@ WG and to face the shortage of skilled workers in the administration .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the administration should develop a concept for personnel recruitment and personnel development according to the wish of the parties . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the aim is not only to meet short @-@ term needs of skilled workers , but to counter@@ act the future @-@ oriented application shortage .
the overall concept should be oriented towards the inside and the outside , show concrete measures for lateral entran@@ ts and include a training offensive , demand CD@@ U , F@@ DP and U@@ WG .
that sounds like a good approach .
because the circle has to do with personnel problems that you didn &apos;t know before .
other cities adverti@@ se good officials and employees and offer more attractive terms .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the speech is of a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; competition for public employers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is due to a high number of employees who ex@@ crete disease or age @-@ related reasons from the service .
so high time to act so that no more jobs will remain un@@ occupied .
but Klaus @-@ Dieter races , leader of the CD@@ U , goes beyond the common application with his party .
he took care of a big surprise already in the working circle , when he publicly challenged the personnel costs cover and start@@ led the other parties .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; people want all possibilities to be reviewed that allow exit from the local employers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; association . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if we do not meet at short notice to a satisfactory solution , the circle administration with the trade unions - perhaps also in cooperation with the county @-@ affiliated towns - should strive for a tari@@ ff , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
with this , the CD@@ U tries to better pay the employees and officials when it actually previ@@ ews the tari@@ ff for public service .
the sal@@ aries are currently exact prescribed , increases or more money is available only if one changes to a higher level oriented towards career years .
but the tasks of the circle grew more and more in recent years .
only a few weeks ago , new premises had to be set up in which employees take care of the provisions of the new pro@@ stitution law .
last but not least due to the increasing number of asylum seekers , Land@@ rat Thomas Hen@@ del@@ e and district director Martin Richter have a problem : they have too little staff .
Italy wor@@ sens the tone on NGO migrants &apos; rescue boats
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Italy has warned NGOs that use lif@@ ebo@@ ats for migrants in the Mediterranean , warned that they should not continue this unless they stick to new rules for their operations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; if NGOs do not sign a new code of conduct , it is difficult to see how they can continue working , &quot; said Home Secretary Marco Minn@@ iti in an interview with the Turin daily La St@@ amp@@ a .
Min@@ ni@@ tis warning came a day after the Italian authorities conf@@ is@@ cated a boat of the German aid organisation &apos; Youth Ret@@ tet &apos; because their team had worked effectively with human traffi@@ ckers in a way facilit@@ ating illegal immigration .
the relief organisation , which has only been in operation for one year , refused to comment on the detailed alleg@@ ations of the Italian prosec@@ utor &apos;s Amb@@ ro@@ gio Car@@ to@@ sio .
&quot; for us , the saving of human life is our top priority . so we are very sorry that we cannot operate in the search and rescue area at the moment , &quot; said the organization in a statement on the social media .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we can only assess all accus@@ ations that are currently being raised after we have collected all the information and assess the situation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Italian authorities had supervised the boat of &apos; Youth Ret@@ tet &apos; , the I@@ u@@ v@@ enta , since October .
it is thought that the crew will ship infl@@ atable din@@ gh@@ y migrants who are delivered to them directly by human traffi@@ ckers , and smu@@ g@@ gl@@ ers can depart so that the ships can be used again .
at least one such meeting took place only 1.3 miles off the Libyan coast , according to the Prosecutor of the Prosecutor , whose contents were published by Italian media .
the crew is suspected of being over@@ thrown by the authority of the Italian Co@@ ast@@ guard , the rescue operations in the zone for humanitarian reasons and not from any other motives .
under the Code of Con@@ duct , boats such as the I@@ u@@ v@@ enta must mainly have an Italian police officer who monitors their activities .
only three of the nine NGOs involved in search and rescue missions have previously agreed to adhere to the code : save the Children , Mo@@ as from Malta and Pro @-@ Activ@@ a Open Ar@@ ms from Spain .
the latter said on Thursday that the new rules would be considered unnecessary , but acceptable , as they would not bring &quot; essential changes or obstruc@@ tions &quot; to their rescue operations .
among those who refuse to sign , the Nobel Prize winner organization Doc@@ tors Without Bor@@ ders ( MS@@ F ) .
Minn@@ iti now said that the number of migrants who arrived in Italy after the ba@@ il@@ out measures in Italy was greatly reduced in recent weeks , which meant that efforts to strengthen the Libyan coast@@ guards and cooperation with local may@@ ors have borne fruit .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in recent days we began to see light at the end of the tunnel , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the minister . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he announced plans for further talks with Libyan citizens this month for economic development initiatives and with C@@ had , Niger and Mali on measures to reduce the number of migrants who leave these countries in hope to reach Europe .
asc@@ ents and Tri@@ als
nine Wei@@ ler@@ mers Bi@@ ker , the &quot; Berlin out@@ post &quot; and two guest drivers met in Wach@@ en@@ heim in the North Pal@@ at@@ inate for four days to enjoy Tri@@ als and si@@ ght@@ se@@ ein@@ gs .
three friendly guides were available for this purpose .
the accommodation in the Wach@@ en@@ heimer valley proved to be a good starting point for the tours .
the Burg@@ - and Wine Festival of Wach@@ en@@ heim was a welcome extra .
the first tour resulted in hot summer temperatures along the vineyards to the Micha@@ el@@ skap@@ elle above Dei@@ des@@ heim .
there followed views , partly on towers , from which one could look far over the P@@ fäl@@ zer Wald and the up@@ stream plains .
in between there were again and again longer asc@@ ents , for the long tri@@ als to reward .
on the second day we went to Bad Dür@@ k@@ heim to the Sal@@ ine and the folk festival Wur@@ st@@ markt .
again , view point on the look@@ out point , connected by &quot; flo@@ wered &quot; tri@@ ples and moderate asc@@ ents .
over the last two days many altitude metres were announced again .
caves , rocks , towers , castles , ruins and in@@ roads brought welcome p@@ auses .
in Bad Dür@@ k@@ heim , the bi@@ kers inhal@@ ed cur@@ ative br@@ ine in the open air inhal@@ atorium .
Neu@@ stadt was also controlled .
after 17@@ 3 kilometres and almost 4@@ 500 metres altitude , the group met the P@@ fäl@@ zer Wald from its best side - sporty and cul@@ turally .
console instead of grass - Bundes@@ liga ar@@ gues for e @-@ sport
will sports stars in the future be sitting in front of computer consoles , rather than going through the stadium @-@ ras@@ en with wind and weather ?
fact is : e @-@ sports has long since become a serious business , becoming a lu@@ cr@@ ative business - big stars , millions of fans and giant tournaments with high levels .
these have also recognised the first Bundes@@ li@@ ga@@ ver@@ eine which are increasingly engaged in this field .
the beginning of 2015 was the V@@ f@@ L Wolfs@@ burg , later the FC Schal@@ ke 04 and last of the V@@ f@@ B Stuttgart , who founded an E @-@ sports department in mid @-@ July , and two professionals for the computer game FIFA 17 entered into contract .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we hope to inspire completely new young target groups for the V@@ f@@ B , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says CEO Jochen R@@ ött@@ ger@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is sure &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that on this train some clubs rise . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the FIFA World Cup in London will take part in the first &quot; Interactive Club World Cup &quot; in London next weekend in which the gam@@ ers of different clubs compete against each other .
in addition to Schal@@ ke und Wolfs@@ burg , Manchester City , Paris Saint @-@ Ger@@ main and PS@@ V Ein@@ d@@ ho@@ ven have qualified for example .
Robin D@@ utt also sees great potential in the E @-@ sport .
the ex @-@ trainer of Bayer Le@@ verk@@ usen and Wer@@ der Bremen meanwhile advises an agency for virtual football players .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; real football has to deal with 14 to 30 @-@ year @-@ olds that young people will still go to the stadium in the future , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the 52 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and : the clubs tried to conquer all sorts of markets , especially the asi@@ an ones .
with prominent e @-@ athletes under contract , you could be much more often present on these markets online than once a year to send the federal government to Asia .
what is it all about ?
at E @-@ Sport , computer games such as &quot; League Of Legends , &quot; &quot; D@@ ota 2 , &quot; &quot; Co@@ unter@@ strike &quot; or the football simulation of FIFA will be fought at competitive level .
as in normal sports , Li@@ gen has long since established itself in which professionals compete against each other .
and in the Asian Games , E @-@ Sports is already part of the official programme .
but is it a real sport ?
for many , the idea is certainly getting used to .
In@@ go F@@ att@@ ler has also dealt with the question for a long time .
for the professor at the German Sports College in Cologne , e @-@ sports is a sport because it is competitive and shows many biological and physical reactions , which can also be found in classical sports - for example , increased heart rates , stress reactions , hormon@@ al changes .
it also requires cognitive skills , a technical and tac@@ tical understanding and a quick reaction .
professional gam@@ ers should exercise not only on the console , but also their body and pay attention to the diet .
&quot; the fit player is a good player . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but it also sees problems : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; dop@@ ing is becoming more and more a topic . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
checks were difficult to carry out on online games , and in the scene the structures of classical sports were missing .
in a positive way , the scientist sets out the high integrity of the E @-@ Sports .
the players are on the move internationally , that &apos;s like a big global family , there are no intercultural obstacles .
a study by the corporate consulting company Del@@ o@@ itte and the Federal Association of Interactive Entertainment software ( BI@@ U ) predic@@ ts rapid growth in e @-@ sport .
in 2016 , 50 million euros have been implemented in Germany , mainly via advertising , sponsor@@ ing and big tournaments .
sales will be 130 million in three years .
against the almost 2.4 billion Euro of the Bundes@@ liga , this is little .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , the E @-@ Sports &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is no longer far from the other established sports such as hand@@ ball , basketball or ice ho@@ ckey , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; write the Del@@ o@@ itte &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; consultant . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
internationally , many countries are already in progress .
big markets are Asia and the USA , where ex @-@ basketball player Sha@@ qu@@ ille O &apos;@@ Ne@@ al and Bas@@ eb@@ all@@ star Alex Rodri@@ gu@@ ez join the US Team N@@ R@@ G e@@ Sports .
Hollywood actor Ash@@ ton Kut@@ cher inv@@ ests in the e@@ sports bet@@ ting company Uni@@ crowned .
there is also a lot happening in Europe .
in a Norwegian school e @-@ sport has been introduced as instruc@@ tional subject , says F@@ rom@@ atic .
in the Netherlands and France , according to D@@ utt , the football league clubs are meanwhile obliged to set up an E @-@ sports department .
&quot; in the European comparison Germany lag@@ ged behind , &quot; explains V@@ f@@ B CEO R@@ ött@@ ger@@ mann .
just to fall into nostal@@ gia and to clear the old times is no longer enough today .
the aim is to preserve the tradition of the association , but to align it with the modern market at the same time .
&quot; we live in a digi@@ ti@@ zed world , &quot; writes D@@ utt .
&quot; you can &apos;t stick to the fact that only in football everything remains as it was . &quot;

Michelle Car@@ ter condem@@ ns convic@@ tions of the lyrics , the Con@@ rad Roy himself
a woman from Massachusetts was sentenced to two and a half years because she encouraged her boy@@ friend through texts and calls to commit suicide .
Michelle Car@@ ter , now 20 , will spend 15 months of her conviction behind bars and five years have been exposed to prob@@ ation .
Car@@ ter was convic@@ ted in June for a neg@@ ligent murder by Con@@ rad Roy , who took his life on 13 July 2014 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the father of Roy spoke at the hearing on Thursday : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my family is un@@ comfor@@ ting . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
my son was my best friend . &quot;
Car@@ ter was allowed to stay free until the appointment .
she had been confronted with a maximum penalty of 20 years , but her legal representatives argued that both she and Mr Roy had suffered from a mental illness .
dressed in red trousers and a cream @-@ colored bl@@ ouse , Car@@ ter stood there with tears in his eyes , with folded hands and downward pointing eyes when she was convic@@ ted .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; their actions have killed Con@@ rad Roy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the prosec@@ utor to the court . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she finished his life to make her own better . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she took no responsibility , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; she has shown no regre@@ ts . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but Car@@ ter &apos;s lawyer said it was a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; terrible circum@@ stance &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , Ju@@ dge Lawrence Mon@@ iz said he did not find that their &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; age or maturity &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or even their mental illness have a significant impact on their actions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a public prosec@@ utor read a statement by Ro@@ ys &apos;s mother Lyn@@ n Roy , who said that there is &quot; no day in which I do not mo@@ urn the loss of my beloved son .
I want him to be proud of me and how to deal with everything . I try to be there for eternity , despite all my pain , which we will carry with us for eternity . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ro@@ ys &apos;s sister , Cam@@ dy@@ n Roy , testified that she would &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; follow &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that she would never be participating in her brother &apos;s wedding or be an a@@ unt for his children . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no longer this single person with whom I have been together since my birth is a pain that I will keep with me for the rest of my life , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the case seems to be a legal preced@@ ent since there is no law in Massachusetts that makes it a crime to urge someone to commit suicide .
Car@@ ter was 17 years old when Roy was found dead in 2014 by a carbon mon@@ oxide pois@@ oning in a vehicle .
the case attracted national attention after Car@@ ters revealed text messages that she encouraged him to end his life .
&quot; hang on , spring from a building , get yourself , I don &apos;t know there are many ways , &quot; she said in several messages she had sent in the two weeks before his death while he was on vacation with his family .
in the moments before his suicide , she wrote : &quot; you must do it , Con@@ rad &quot; and &quot; Every@@ thing you have to do is turn on the generator and you will be free and happy . &quot;
judge Mon@@ iz said that Car@@ ter &apos;s attention was sought by Roy &apos;s death and ordered that they should benefit from any press from the case .
the case has shared the legal opinion .
among the few who defended Car@@ ter was Am@@ anda Kno@@ x , who was convic@@ ted of murder of her British ro@@ omm@@ ate in Italy in 2007 before being acqu@@ itted two years ago .
Ms. Kno@@ x , 30 years old , published a comment in the Los Angeles Times : &quot; Michelle Car@@ ter deserves compassion and help , not jail . &quot;
Joshua Kim@@ i : learning from the new Mini @-@ L@@ ame of FC Bayern
the fact that Joshua was allowed to run on the Audi Cup as a captain is not a coincidence .
the FC Bayern will entr@@ ust a big season to the Con@@ fed Cup winner - extra motivation will not hurt .
something was different on his place in the cabin , which saw Joshua Kim@@ ber@@ ley immediately , even if the additional garment was very , very small .
but as far and wide on the second day of the Audi C@@ ups , of course , no Philipp L@@ ame and no Manuel Neu@@ er had to be seen , he stopped the rush of his arm .
&quot; the coach did not announce it , &quot; said the Con@@ fed @-@ Cup @-@ winner afterwards , after his first deployment as Bayern @-@ captain .
good , the level could have run better than at 0 : 2 against the SS@@ C Naples .
but Kim@@ olos could also interpret the sign of the coach .
not the eight @-@ year @-@ old Ar@@ tur@@ o Vi@@ dal was chosen as a game leader in the C @-@ El@@ f existing from youth players , de@@ but@@ ants and especially from vacation .
sugar is best spread to those who have a lot to do , which you want to keep in a good mood .
those who have been chosen to take over the heritage of L@@ ame can only use a little extra motivation .
Kim@@ olos confirmed : &quot; this is what you want as a player : take responsibility . &quot;
on Wednesday , the 22 @-@ year @-@ old took over the field as a mini @-@ l@@ ame .
right rear , this is his position , the white band@@ age on the arm did its rest .
and Kim@@ ber worked like the one who can take the helm in his hand at all .

as usual this Bavaria @-@ world is still for the newcom@@ ers , one looked at the game after the game .
for example , Ru@@ dy did not give one or two interviews in the cat@@ ac@@ om@@ bs , but six or seven interviews .
Kim@@ ber@@ ley said good@@ bye to his new fellow players after a few crisp statements .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there he heard of Sü@@ le an interesting phrase : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what &apos;s going on here I have already noticed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you simply have to win any game in Bavaria . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

company content with Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate Minister : economy pra@@ ises Wis@@ con@@ ian pace
it was often irre@@ conc@@ il@@ able , the relationship between the country and the regional economy , when E@@ vel@@ ine Lem@@ ke ( Green ) was still Minister of Economic Affairs of Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate .
this shows after more than a year in which the new Minister of Economy Volker Wis@@ sing ( F@@ DP ) is in office .
chambers and companies from the region talk about a shift in economic policy on T V @-@ demand - and at the same time blame the old ministers .
Frank nat@@ us , Chairman of the Association of Trier companies ( V@@ TU ) , says : &quot; Wis@@ sing attacks the wishes of the economy , which Lem@@ ke has all blocked . &quot;
nat@@ us in the infra@@ structural policy : the gap between Kel@@ berg and Aden@@ au is now at the top of the priority list of the country .
this year , the ministry hopes for a planning process , until 2021 will be the right to construction .
a role in the plans of the country is also played by the West@@ um@@ geh@@ ung Trier , which is in the urgent need of the federal transport network .
the aim is to put the route into operation in December 2020 , says Minist@@ erial Spe@@ aker Corn@@ elia Hol@@ t@@ mann .
of course , nat@@ us sees in it a sign@@ post to support regional , but internationally competing companies .
the Chamber of Industry and Commerce ( I@@ HK ) Trier aims , as expected by Wis@@ sing , in the wine of a Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate @-@ label to increase sales in supermarkets and to stop the trend of the German wine exports falling for ten years .
in addition , Wis@@ sing has an open ear for people who want to establish their own company lob@@ bies .
the Cra@@ fts@@ men Chamber of Trier provides an additional incentive for young apprenti@@ ces in the new master bonus , says managing director Matthias Sch@@ wal@@ bach .
a premium of 1000 Euro is provided for the passing master exam and 2500 euros if graduates do their own on their own within ten years after the master &apos;s training .
but the home@@ work list for the country remains long .
the planned road construction is quick to provide facts , and at the same time the country lacks the necessary personnel , says Jan Glock@@ auer , chief executive of the Chamber of Commerce of the Chamber of Commerce of Trier .
of 56 new engineers who want to employ Wis@@ sing in the state @-@ run mobility , only 29 jobs have been occupied until now .
the Chamber calls for more orders to be awarded to external offices .
s &amp; D vice @-@ president Christian Bal@@ d@@ auf refers to calculations of the Court of Audi@@ tors , the country has invested more than 20 million euros less in the receipt of country roads by 2017 and 2018 .
in addition , Frank nat@@ us also expects the country &apos;s concept of how to remedy the shortage of skilled workers in the region .
furthermore , the existing broad@@ band expansion in the country is so@@ ber@@ ing .
in 2016 , regional companies evaluated net supply in an I@@ HK survey only with a rating of 3.4 .
they compl@@ ained about increasing internet connections and out@@ breaks .
on the other hand , ex @-@ business minister E@@ vel@@ ine Lem@@ ke is out of politics at the moment and is still sitting in the supervisory board of the wind power company Pro Wind .
the Green Group left Lem@@ ke in April to become president of a private university in Karlsruhe , where after four months they already cleared the field for in@@ consisten@@ cies .
Audi is expected to change 8@@ 50,000 diesel vehicles - car manufacturers face a counter reaction
one day before the announcement of Audi , BMW said it would offer to update the software in more than 3@@ 50,000 vehicles .
the BMW president said the company believes that &quot; there are more intelligent options than driving limitations , &quot; and thus referring to European cities - including Munich , where BMW is based - to ban or limit diesel vehicles .
Daimler announced on Tuesday that it will modify three million Mercedes vehicles in Europe to reduce its diesel emissions .
none of the companies described the enterprises as a recall .
European autom@@ akers have strongly encouraged the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States to support compliance with rules on carbon dioxide emissions .
but the nitrogen oxi@@ des that em@@ it diesel engines are considered carcin@@ o@@ gens and may cause asthma .
the cost of the car manufacturers to install facilities for neutr@@ alizing exhaust f@@ umes from diesel vehicles also increase , making it difficult to keep the price of cars competitive .
German Chancellor Angela Merkel is also accused of wa@@ sting powerful car companies and ignor@@ ing the signs of the problem .
companies try to avoid the failure of Volkswagen , which could regulate the use of so @-@ called laun@@ cher equipment that could regulate emissions to comply with the regulations when a car was tested , but driving back under normal driving conditions .
in the United States , several Volkswagen employees were charged ; others were examined on both sides of the Atlantic .
last month , the former head of ther@@ mod@@ ynam@@ ics was arrested in the engine development of Audi in Germany .
the former manager , Z@@ ac@@ che@@ o Giovanni P@@ am@@ io , is an Italian and is therefore not protected from extra@@ dition and could be put in court in the United States .
at the beginning of this year , Audi was involved in German criminal investigations in Volkswagen after the authorities acc@@ using Audi to have installed a system to circum@@ vent emissions legislation in Europe , and a request focused on the United States has been expanded .
the inclusion of Audi into the investigation could weigh heavily on Volkswagen : the luxury car manufacturer contributed dispro@@ portion@@ ately to Volkswagen &apos;s profit .
this message has the raft on Saturday at Is@@ ar
the city wants to protect the Is@@ ar .
in order for the Is@@ ar visitors to participate , a raft from Munich takes place on Saturday morning , which has a special message .
those who go to the Is@@ ar on Saturday will see a big raft between F@@ lau@@ cher and Rei@@ chen@@ bach@@ brücke .
and that is not a common raft , with Is@@ ar tourists .
but the building paper wants to clear up .
on the raft you can see a large Inf@@ otran@@ sm@@ ent .
it shows a garbage mountain .
the pr@@ el@@ ude to an publicity campaign to appeal to the Is@@ ar visitors .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the motto &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; True Love &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ... &quot; is to shar@@ pen our understanding of the Is@@ ar as a wildlife abo@@ und . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
already last summer the raft passed over the Is@@ ar and also this year there are more actions and measures to achieve a consider@@ ate and environmentally conscious behavior .
Mor@@ dil@@ los Sti@@ ff @-@ bun@@ ni@@ es and laugh@@ ing against the suffering
from time to time , Mor@@ di@@ llo was one of the most popular carto@@ on@@ ist dra@@ fts@@ men , the b@@ oll@@ enn@@ es of his characters are his trademark .
also with 85 , the Argent@@ ine@@ an is still working and working on a film .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; his message : laugh , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for there is too much suffering in the world . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Guill@@ ermo Mor@@ di@@ llo was born on 4 August 1932 as a son of Spanish immigrants in Buenos Aires .
in the first years as an artist he distinguished himself among other things as a sign of greeting cards - which frustr@@ ated him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the happ@@ i@@ est day in my professional life was the day when I lost my job , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he once said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after stops in Lima , New York and Paris he made a breakthrough at the end of the 1960s : with the publication of his carto@@ ons in &quot; Paris Match , &quot; and then also in the &quot; Star &quot; and other leading magazines around the world .
even in China , Mor@@ di@@ llo found many fans .
again and again the artist was inspired by cities .
large , ro@@ un@@ dish Mor@@ di@@ llo figures ca@@ vor@@ t in drawings with the Le@@ aning Tower of Pisa , Big Ben in London and the Red Square in Moscow .
in the early morning , according to his own statements , he still sits at the drawing table , works almost ten hours a day .
about cal@@ endar@@ s , puzzles , books for young and old , t @-@ shirts , pl@@ ush toys and watches continue to be widely distributed worldwide .
he has been working on a cartoon film and a TV series with his figures for six years .
the main person in the movie &quot; Cra@@ zy Island &quot; is a gi@@ ra@@ ffe - Mor@@ dil@@ los any animal in his drawings - that has a thous@@ and@@ th of a counter @-@ player .
for the first time , his figures speak in the 3D film , which should come to the cinema screen in 2019 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know exactly what they say , it is strange for me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Mor@@ di@@ llo . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the script is not written by him .
that is why he rather relies on the TV series , which , like his original drawings , is produced without a word .
Lav@@ ender from Provence threatened by climate change
he has become a symbol of Provence in the South of France , but there is a warning that he is threatened with climate change .
the la@@ ven@@ der is decreasing due to the conditions that are reminiscent of drought and due to disease @-@ transmitting insects , which causes scientists and farmers who try to find solutions , causing great head@@ aches .
Eric Cha@@ isse , expert of the agricultural research institute C@@ RI@@ EP@@ PA@@ M in Provence , said : &quot; the la@@ ven@@ der in Provence is effectively endangered because the plant has been exposed to the effects of climate change in recent years , which brought much less rain in the spring and much more in autumn .
this has an impact on the li@@ fes@@ pan of la@@ ven@@ der .
there is also a small zi@@ k@@ ade , a micro@@ bacter@@ ium that transfers d@@ warf ci@@ ca@@ das , and in very dry weather there are many of them . &quot;
and there is much in the game .
la@@ ven@@ der oil not only attracts tourists , it is also very popular for perfume and cosmetics .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Eric Cha@@ isse said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; instead of having very long plant ears with a large number of flowers , we have minor , under@@ developed and either missing or weakened . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
so we have fewer parts with essential oil . &quot;
the solutions that are considered include a better water distribution and the slow@@ down of evap@@ oration from the soil , but also the spra@@ ying of plants with a protective blend of clay and water and the development of varieties that are more resistant to drought .
the town of Gei@@ sa in the Thur@@ in@@ gian R@@ hö@@ n celebrates its 1200 @-@ year anniversary .
the festival point is this Saturday and Sunday with a medieval festival .
Krä@@ mer , guil@@ ds , dealers , vag@@ aries , or a country ski@@ pper should be able to experience these days in the city centre .
the assass@@ ination of a journalist under@@ lines the growing threat in Mexico
the employees of the weekly paper Ri@@ odo@@ ce normally meet Wednesday to review their plans for reporting on the recent chaos in the state of Sin@@ alo@@ a by organised crime , corrupt officials and inc@@ ess@@ ant drug wars .
but on that day , in the shadow of their own tragedy , they came together to talk about security .
they were told that it is important to change their routines .
two high @-@ ranking journalists discuss what feels more secure : they should take their children to the office , which were the target of an attack with gr@@ en@@ ades in 2009 , or leave them at home .
security experts have written three words on a table at the front of the room : opponents , Neut@@ ral , Al@@ lies .
they ask the repor@@ ters to suggest names for each column - no evidence is necessary , percep@@ tions and gut feelings suff@@ ice .
there are drug smu@@ g@@ gl@@ ers , politicians , business@@ men , journalists who are suspected of standing on the pay@@ roll of the government or cart@@ els , a catalogue of criminals who make the chaos of Mexico dangerous .
there is no break from violence , and while in the whole country the corp@@ ses are pil@@ ed up , more and more journalists are there : at least 25 since President En@@ rique P@@ ena N@@ ie@@ to took office in December 2012 . 5@@ 89 are under federal protection after attacks and threats and until now there have been at least seven deaths in seven countries this year .
among the latter is her editor and her inspir@@ er of Ri@@ odo@@ ce , co @-@ founder J@@ avier Val@@ dez Car@@ den@@ as .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the biggest mistake is to live in Mexico and be a journalist , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Val@@ dez wrote in one of his numerous books on violence related to drugs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his absence is felt deep , although his presence is everywhere - a large photo of Val@@ dez , showing his middle finger with the word &quot; Justice , &quot; hangs on the facade of the Ri@@ odo@@ ce building . two repor@@ ters in the thir@@ ties , Aaron I@@ bar@@ ra and Mi@@ ri@@ am Ram@@ i@@ rez , wear t @-@ shirts which show his smiling face with glasses or his typical Pan@@ am@@ ah@@ ut .
the workshop takes place less than two months after his death , and the repor@@ ters discuss their shared topics , the trauma , their night@@ mares , sle@@ e@@ pl@@ essness , par@@ ano@@ ia .
although a special Federal At@@ tor@@ ney General was established in 2010 to deal with the cases of journalists , only two criminal proceedings were initiated by the Committee on the Protection of Journ@@ alists .
as with most thousands of mur@@ ders , which are associated with drug traffi@@ cking and organised crime every year , journalists are rarely indic@@ ted by journalists .
at Ri@@ odo@@ ce , they still ins@@ ist on treating the violence of Sin@@ alo@@ a although they are un@@ comfor@@ ting and although the terrain is now more tre@@ ach@@ er@@ ous .
without information about mur@@ der@@ ers , without justice , the meeting to discuss safety has little benefit , says I@@ bar@@ ra .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is very stupid to waste my time in this workshop , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as long as we don &apos;t know the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why , we all mi@@ str@@ ust everybody . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the morning of 15 May Val@@ dez left the office of the newspaper Ri@@ odo@@ ce in the capital of C@@ uli@@ ac@@ an .
he managed to drive a few blocks far before his red Toyota Cor@@ oll@@ a was stopped by two men . he was forced out of his car and 12 times was shot on him , probably because of the name of the newspaper , which is translated with &quot; T@@ wel@@ fth River . &quot;
the sho@@ oter drove away in his car and damaged it nearby .
Val@@ dez was 50 years old .
he left a woman and two grown @-@ up children .
rum@@ ors tend to fly freely in C@@ uli@@ ac@@ an .
but on the subject of Val@@ dez there is practically nothing but silence .
since Gu@@ z@@ man &apos;s arrest last year and extra@@ dition to the United States in January , Sin@@ alo@@ a became one of the bloo@@ dies@@ t batt@@ le@@ fields in the country , as rival fac@@ tions fight here to fill the vacuum .
it doesn &apos;t matter that in Sin@@ alo@@ a every day someone or several people are shot on the street or that the cemetery is full of decorated , two @-@ story mouse mos@@ ques for drug kings that are larger than many homes for the living .
forget for a minute that there is a state of &quot; rest &quot; when only a cart@@ el has control of the coastal state with its valuable ports and drug trade routes in the United States .
nevertheless and despite the fact that Val@@ dez was aware of the dangers of his work , Is@@ mail Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez ( 60 ) , a co @-@ founder and director of Ri@@ odo@@ ce , was broken with the blame that he could not protect his friend .
he believes that two mis@@ understand@@ ings have contributed to the murder .
at first there was the publication of an interview with Damascus Lop@@ ez , a leader of one of the rival cart@@ el frac@@ tions in the war with Gu@@ z@@ man &apos;s sons .
this publication may anno@@ y the sons , suspected side members bought each copy of the issue as soon as they were delivered to newspaper ki@@ os@@ ks .
the second mistake was that Val@@ dez did not force him to leave the country for his own security after the sei@@ z@@ ure of another newspaper , which had published the same story .
Val@@ dez was a legend in Mexico and abroad , and his killing is considered a milestone in Mexican violence against journalists .
he had survived so long that his friends and colleagues assumed that he would always be there .
he worked as an experienced journalist for Nor@@ o@@ este in 2003 when he joined five colleagues in the founding of Ri@@ odo@@ ce and sold 50 US dollar hol@@ dings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Sin@@ alo@@ a , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was impossible to run journ@@ alism without encounter@@ ing the toxic@@ ity problem , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
over time , the newspaper has earned a reputation for courageous and honest reporting , and sales and advertising increased .
repor@@ ters loved to be able to publish hard @-@ fitting investigations without fear of cens@@ orship , and readers were fascinated by a publication where they could read stories that no one else dar@@ ed to treat .
eight years after the founding of Ri@@ odo@@ ce , she received the prestigious &quot; Maria @-@ Mo@@ ors @-@ Cab@@ ot Award &quot; for her coverage in Latin America .
in the same year , Val@@ dez gained the &apos; International Press Freedom Award &apos; of the Committee for the Protection of Journ@@ alists for his courage in the persecution of Mexican drug history , wherever it led .
he volunte@@ ered to be afraid .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I want to continue living , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said at the time of the CP@@ J award . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; drug traffi@@ cking in Sin@@ alo@@ a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is a way of life , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said last October in an interview with Rom@@ pe@@ vi@@ ento @-@ TV . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you have to take the task that you as a journalist - either that or you play the dum@@ b . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t want to be asked : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what did you do in view of so many dead ... why didn &apos;t you say what was going on ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Ri@@ odo@@ ci@@ ce team missed Val@@ dez , the fun bird that could escape like a do@@ ck@@ worker , a friend who was generous with hu@@ gs and advice , a teacher who knew how to survive .
they trusted in his routine .
he would always wear his hat .
he would always go to El Guay@@ ab@@ o , the bar opposite the office , and there always sit at the same table .
now they ask : was his love for routine his ruin ?
his death also forced them to question their own assumptions about how they can best do their work and stay alive .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they don &apos;t like it when you deal with their women , their children , their clean stores , their secret start and run@@ ways , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for drugs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; these things were not allowed , &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez .
the result is , even in the best times , a high degree of self @-@ cens@@ orship and self @-@ preservation .
trust his own inst@@ inc@@ ts .
if it sm@@ ells wrong , stay away from it .
the trouble is , the editor of the Ri@@ odo@@ ce Andr@@ es Vill@@ ar@@ real said that &quot; smell is a sense that can be fool@@ ed ... and then the thing happened to J@@ avier . &quot;
the old rules , as he and others say , are no longer valid in Sin@@ alo@@ a - just as in Tam@@ au@@ lip@@ as , Ver@@ ac@@ ru@@ z , Gu@@ err@@ ero and other states in which a po@@ ison@@ ous mix of lu@@ cr@@ ative smu@@ g@@ gling routes , weak institutions and corrupt government officials are at home .
the landscape changes constantly .
in the room where the staff of Ri@@ odo@@ ce met for safety training , suddenly no mobile phones were allowed . days before was known that Spy@@ ware , which is sold exclusively to governments , was used to monitor journalists and activists in Mexico .
outside , two polic@@ emen were looking for protection from the heat of 104 degrees ( 40 ° C ) in the shade of a tree .
they were commissioned by the provincial government to protect the offices of Ri@@ odo@@ ce in a four @-@ story building in a mid @-@ size quarter of C@@ uli@@ ac@@ an .
half in the joke , some of the repor@@ ters asked themselves whether these officers were among the 50 percent of the police officers who were not trust@@ worthy by the Gover@@ nor himself .
it is months since the repor@@ ters went to the mountain landscape where drug gangs are de facto under control .
for the issue of this week , Ri@@ odo@@ ce has rested on three main stories .
there was the murder of the brother of the former well @-@ known speaker Juli@@ o C@@ esar Cha@@ vez in Sin@@ alo@@ a .
they also had an exposure to state expendi@@ tures focused on the home town of the governor .
and there was a group in one of the most expensive restaurants in C@@ uli@@ ac@@ an , a block away from the Office of the Prosecutor , leading a kidn@@ apping .
there was no official word about who was kidn@@ apped or how it happened , so be careful when it was time to write what everyone in the city knows that the restaurant is a favorite local of drug dealers and authorities .
a repor@@ ter learned from public records that the restaurant was registered under the name of a politi@@ cian who belonged to the ruling Institu@@ tional Revolution Party ( PR@@ I ) , which reigned almost all the century all the political planes .
recently several PR@@ I govern@@ ors were accused of high @-@ profile cases of corruption .
Vill@@ ar@@ real asked the repor@@ ter to write about previous events in this restaurant , including one in which a son of &quot; El Chap@@ o &quot; Gu@@ z@@ man escaped a military assault .
only a few months earlier , readers would have considered the column of Val@@ dez as the best informed source about kidn@@ apping .
&quot; in the past we had known what happened , &quot; said Vill@@ ar@@ real , 46 , with the nick@@ name &quot; El Fl@@ aco &quot; because of his slender body stat@@ ure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now all communication channels are broken with our sources . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Val@@ dez office became a storage room for signs and sti@@ ckers prot@@ esting against the kill@@ ings of journalists , because the employees had become something they had never expected : activists in the name of the press .
repor@@ ter Mi@@ ri@@ am Ram@@ i@@ rez took a few signs and went to the office of the prosec@@ utor the next morning for a demonstration because of another journalist .
Salvador Ad@@ ame disappeared three days after Val@@ dez was killed in the western state of Mich@@ o@@ ac@@ an .
a burnt body was discovered and officials say based on DNA tests that it is its .
throughout the country , journalists have become lou@@ der by writing down &quot; S@@ OS Press &quot; protests and constructions in organized protests .
on that day , the director Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez is away in Washington and tries to collect international support for justice in the Val@@ dez case .
at a meeting with the governor of Sin@@ alo@@ a on the day after the murder of Val@@ dez , Ram@@ i@@ rez accused the authorities to spy on journalists and kill them because they told the truth .
she has since asked her to be re @-@ sub@@ divided by the government because she is worried that her anger viol@@ ated her obj@@ ectivity .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Val@@ dez said repeatedly that journalists are &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; surrounded by organised crime , government officials and a consistent society . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in his last book , &quot; Nar@@ co @-@ Journ@@ alism , &quot; he wrote that repor@@ ters are not only killed by drug gangs , but also on the command of politicians and security forces who were under a blanket with organised crime .
last year , the media group &quot; Arti@@ cul@@ o 19 &quot; assigned more than half of the attacks to journalists of the police and officials .
&quot; in Mexico you die because they want you to keep your mouth , &quot; said Ram@@ i@@ rez .
obviously , the mur@@ ders have a deter@@ rent effect .
nobody for@@ gets the death of the blo@@ gger Maria Elizabeth M@@ aci@@ as in the northern border state of Tam@@ au@@ lip@@ as six years ago .
your body was found together with a note signed by the Z@@ et@@ as cart@@ el : &quot; here I am because of my reports . &quot;
a computer keyboard and headphones were located next to their separate head .
some branches have chosen to close , like the newspaper El Nor@@ te in the northern border state of Chi@@ hu@@ ah@@ ua after the murder of correspon@@ dent Mi@@ ros@@ lava B@@ reach in March .
others continue as El Man@@ ana did from Nu@@ evo Lar@@ edo after the assass@@ ination of its director in 2004 .
in 2010 , the Di@@ ario de Ci@@ u@@ dad Ju@@ are@@ z publicly addressed the drug cart@@ els with an editorial on the title page with the title &quot; What do you want from us ? &quot;
some journalists have fled their home countries or even from the country .
it is a painful decision .
it is hard to find work in exile , and they still watch the streets and look for dangers .
and sometimes they are hun@@ ted as it seems to the photographer Ru@@ ben Esp@@ in@@ osa , who , together with four women in an apartment in Mexico City , was murdered three months after the escape from Ver@@ ac@@ ru@@ z .
for those who stay behind and continue the work , it is a daily dance with ris@@ ky decisions .
I@@ bar@@ ra , who once wanted to be a poet , ad@@ mits that drug traffi@@ cking is frigh@@ tened .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mexico goes to hell , and so I became repor@@ ter , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at midnight on the last Friday , when the last issue was already finished , the editors of Ri@@ odo@@ ce sat on the pav@@ ement in front of the office and d@@ rank beer when at once all their phones began to h@@ um .
a series of sho@@ ot@@ ings with riv@@ ets and security forces near the town of Maz@@ at@@ lan had left 19 confirmed dead .
the war escal@@ ated further , as promised by a number of cart@@ els messages in the region .
from the qu@@ arri@@ es , they published the news on the website of Ri@@ odo@@ ce via mobile phone .
the front page had to be changed the next day .
si@@ r@@ ens near - another shooting in the area .
Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez looked at the polic@@ emen who kept watch to see if they were in readiness .
if they were afraid at all , they did not show it .
under the immense portrait of the fallen founder of the newspaper , whose middle finger was visible for all Sin@@ alo@@ a , the staff of Ri@@ odo@@ ce followed his traces .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how can you just think about closing , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if on the same day , where J@@ avier was murdered , the intern asked me to send her to the street . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
din@@ osau@@ r used cam@@ ou@@ f@@ lage to avoid his enemies
at first sight it looks like a statue , albeit a frigh@@ tening one .
now researchers have discovered that the first findings of the incredible N@@ ash@@ or@@ ns of a Canadian mountain worker were so well received that experts have described it as &quot; Mon@@ a Lisa of the Din@@ osau@@ rs . &quot;
it was so well received that they could even notice that his sc@@ aly skin was red@@ dish brown - and they said they had something of a &quot; troubled past . &quot;
the report in Current Bi@@ ology described him as &quot; the best @-@ preserved din@@ osau@@ r who has ever been found , and one of the best din@@ osau@@ r copies in the world . &quot;
the fossil is a newly discovered species of no@@ dos@@ au@@ rs , living in the middle of the chal@@ k time between 110 million and 112 million years .
his unbeliev@@ ably well @-@ preserved state has astonished scientists who describe it as &quot; truly remarkable . &quot;
according to reports in National Ge@@ ographic , the ar@@ mor@@ ed plant e@@ ater is the best preserved fossil of its kind .
it was found by Sha@@ wn Funk , when he dug in the S@@ unc@@ or Mill@@ enium mine near Fort Mc@@ Mur@@ ray in the north of Alber@@ ta , Canada .
he met something that seemed out of place of the surrounding rock , and decided to look more closely .
the fossil discovered by him was sent to the Royal Ty@@ r@@ rel@@ l Museum of Pal@@ e@@ ont@@ ology .
they spent the next six years discovering the wild animal within the 2,500 pounds ( 1,@@ 100 kg ) heavy earth@@ en@@ ware .
after all this hard work , the finished result is now ready to be revealed .
&quot; if you only smile a little with your eyes , you could almost believe that it slept , &quot; said the main author Cal@@ eb Brown , scientist at the Royal Ty@@ r@@ rel@@ l Museum , where the creature is to be seen .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it will enter the history of science as one of the most beautiful and best preserved din@@ osau@@ r copies - the Mon@@ a Lisa of the din@@ osau@@ r . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
researchers have found that this her@@ bi@@ vor@@ ous , even though it is covered with a arm@@ or and resembles a changing tank , is probably threatened by car@@ ni@@ vor@@ ous din@@ osau@@ rs .
the heavily arm@@ oured din@@ osau@@ r used a red and white cam@@ ou@@ f@@ lage to hide from pre@@ dat@@ ors , and used a shiel@@ ding technique known as counter @-@ sh@@ ading , which is also used by many modern animals .
this would have allowed to better blend into its surroundings and to avoid its enemies , experts say , suggest@@ ing that it was threatened by larger din@@ osau@@ rs .
the 110 million year old creature from the No@@ dos@@ au@@ rier family has made head@@ lines for the first time in May and is now available at the Royal Ty@@ r@@ rel@@ l Museum of Pal@@ ae@@ ont@@ ology .
researchers have now studied the wild animal and called it Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta mar@@ su@@ ch@@ elli after the museum engineer Mark Mit@@ ch@@ ell , one of a team that spent more than 7@@ ,000 hours with it carefully .
the astonishing preservation of the specimen made it possible for Dr. Mit@@ ch@@ ell and an international team of scientists to document the pattern and form of scales and arm@@ or over his body .
they discovered the counter sh@@ ading , a widespread defence method in the animal kingdom , which means that the tip of the creature was darker than its under@@ side .
although the counter sh@@ ading is common , the results are surprising as the size of Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta by far exceeds the animals living today .
it indicates that the din@@ osau@@ r was hun@@ ted by din@@ osau@@ rs of sufficient pressure by car@@ ni@@ vor@@ ous din@@ osau@@ rs , that evolution fav@@ oured the conce@@ al@@ ment of the confrontation as a means of survival .
but most contemporary animals that use counter sh@@ ading - think of deer , zeb@@ ras or sh@@ ing@@ les - are much smaller and more vulnerable than prey , which indicates that this No@@ dos@@ au@@ rier was a real battle for survival .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; strong pre@@ dat@@ or behavior on a massive , heavily arm@@ oured din@@ osau@@ r show how dangerous the din@@ osau@@ rs pre@@ dat@@ ors of the chal@@ k time must have been , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Brown . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the chemical analysis of organic compounds in their scales also shows that the skin of the din@@ osau@@ r was bay .
scientists continue to study the animal on indications of his life , including his preserved bow@@ el content to find out what he ate as his last meal .
they believe that the din@@ osau@@ r , when he died , got into a river and was driven out into the sea , where he fell on his back to the bottom of the sea .
at that time Alber@@ ta was as warm as South @-@ flu@@ ori@@ da today , and rivers and oceans are likely far more inland than they are today .
&quot; this No@@ dos@@ au@@ rier is really remarkable because it is completely covered with preserved sc@@ aly skin , but remains intact in three dimensions and retains the original shape of the animal , &quot; said Brown .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the result is that today the animal looks almost the same as in the early chal@@ k time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
you don &apos;t need much imagination to re@@ construct it . if you just have a little with your eyes , you could almost believe that it is sleeping . &quot;
the C@@ ret@@ ac@@ eous period was a time when huge ther@@ opo@@ ds , car@@ ni@@ vor@@ ous din@@ osau@@ rs standing on two legs crossed the earth .
although the king of them , the Ty@@ ran@@ n@@ osau@@ rus Re@@ x , lived millions of years after Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta , the ar@@ mor@@ ed din@@ osau@@ r was hun@@ ted by some of his terri@@ fying ancestors .
this belongs to the Ac@@ ro@@ can@@ th@@ osau@@ rus , a 38 foot ( 11.@@ 5 m ) long , six tons of heavy monsters .
the scientists , whose latest findings appear in Current Bi@@ ology , believe that Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta sank after death in the sea and was m@@ um@@ i@@ fied in the mud .
the creature was found by Sha@@ wn Funk , when he dug in the S@@ unc@@ or Mill@@ enium mine near Fort Mc@@ Mur@@ ray in the north of Alber@@ ta , Canada , on 21 March 2011 .
according to the museum , it is the best preserved din@@ osau@@ r of the world , including skin and arm@@ or , and is completely from the mu@@ zzle to the hip .
the creatures on average were about 18 feet long and have weighed up to 3,000 pounds ( 1,@@ 300 kg ) .
it contained two 20 @-@ inch long spi@@ kes that were prot@@ ru@@ ding from his shoulders .
the researchers believe that the ar@@ mor@@ ed her@@ bi@@ vor@@ ous was swept through the western Canada until a flooded river flooded into the open sea .
but the aqu@@ atic cre@@ mation of the din@@ osau@@ r kept its arm@@ or in exquisite detail .
the pet@@ ri@@ fied remains of this special specimen are preserved so well that the door@@ step still lay b@@ ump@@ y arm@@ oured plates along the din@@ osau@@ r
as Michael G@@ resh@@ ko wrote for National Ge@@ ographic , such a level of conservation is so rare as a win in the lot@@ tery .
the more I approach it , the more conf@@ using it becomes .
c@@ logged remains of the skin still cover the b@@ ump@@ y arm@@ oured plates that carry the skull of the animal .
his right front foot rests on his side , his five fingers are spread upward .
I can count the scales at his sole &apos; .
in the thunder@@ storm : mass ar@@ am@@ bol@@ age on A@@ 8 : many wounded
heavy accident on Thursday evening on the A@@ 8 : almost 30 vehicles are wrapped in a mass ar@@ am@@ bol@@ age .
there are numerous wounded , kilometres @-@ long st@@ alls - and G@@ aff@@ er .
around 20 people were injured on the Stuttgart @-@ Munich motorway ( A@@ 8 ) on the late afternoon of Thursday afternoon .
according to the police , at 5 : 00 p.m. between the junction boxes of Adel@@ z@@ hausen and O@@ del@@ z@@ hausen ( district A@@ ich@@ ach @-@ Fried@@ berg ) during a thunder@@ storm some 30 vehicles , among them probably lor@@ ries , crashed into each other .
the exact number of injured persons does not present any information at all .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a light to moderate injuries , said a police spokesperson . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a large supply of emergency vehicles was at the accident site .
the A@@ 8 was completely closed in the direction of Munich .
in the direction of travel Munich , an approximately ten kilometer long back@@ log was formed .
as an A@@ Z repor@@ ter reports , there was also a ride on the back road to massive obstruc@@ tions - by numerous aff@@ er .
the fire bri@@ g@@ ade noted the characteristics of the car makers , who now have to reck@@ on with sensitive pun@@ ishments .
shortly after 6 : 45 p.m. another accident occ@@ ured on the A@@ 8 , this time between Augsburg and D@@ asing .
there was a collision between a car transpor@@ ter and a car .
a rescue helicopter was on the road to the accident site .
Deutsche Bahn : company tests &quot; comfort check @-@ in &quot;
it is a moment that almost everyone has experienced before : nothing surprising is sitting in the train and sleeping .
or one is deep@@ ened in his work and has just a brilliant mind .
and then : buff@@ f .
comes the conductor and ar@@ ouses an uns@@ cre@@ wed or tears the passenger in the middle of the workflow .
ticket inspec@@ tor .
but the times of interrup@@ tions are soon gone .
the Deutsche Bahn is currently testing the free ticket control .
it is simply confirmed by a mobile phone that you take your seat and de@@ valu@@ ate the ticket .
a test operation is currently running on two tracks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the offer comes , we expand it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the beginning of next year , it will be available on many other long @-@ haul routes in Germany , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a train speaker . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; comfort Check @-@ in &quot; calls the railway ticket de@@ valuation without she@@ ep@@ skin .
to be able to use them , however , some requirements must be met : you need a smartphone or tablet .
and you have to book an online ticket - what most passengers do anyway .
it is also necessary to have purchased the DB navig@@ ator app , which is the most convenient type of ticket booking anyway .
and last but not least you need a seat reservation .
because the &quot; comfort check @-@ in &quot; works like this : one gets into the train , calling out his ticket to &quot; My Tickets . &quot;
a button for the electronic de@@ valuation appears with the test customers .
the train atten@@ d@@ ants get a message on their mobile devices that passenger X is on the train and has taken the booked seat Y .
if the train atten@@ dant arrives at number Y at the ticket inspection , he knows that a passenger sits there with already de@@ valued online ticket .
so you can continue to sleep , continue working , keep silent .
the &quot; check @-@ in &quot; has two advantages : one for the customer , one for the train - which in turn should be used by passengers .
&quot; if you want to travel relaxed without ticket inspection by our train atten@@ dant , you simply check in in the DB navig@@ ator yourself .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this allows passengers to make their travel time on the train more personal , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Michael Peter@@ son , member of the DB &apos;s Marketing Board . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; second plus : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and our employees have more time than today to respond to individual customer needs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
those who often drive train know that in addition to delays and missed trains , ticket inspections are one of the biggest off@@ ences .
because often you do not have all the documents you need for the validation of online tickets in any case .
either the credit card or identity card is missing or a document that must be presented .
the result is endless discussions between train atten@@ d@@ ants and passenger , which leads to a bad mood in the section or large room and delays in controlling one &apos;s own ticket and taking the conductor at the end time to take care of other matters .
only a small number of test customers can use the new service .
and that &apos;s only on the ICE 9@@ 15 Dortmund @-@ Stuttgart connections and ICE 9@@ 12 Stuttgart @-@ Essen .
additional train numbers on the same track are not un@@ locked yet .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how an activ@@ ist came to learn the answer to the question : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on 9 August 2014 Br@@ itt@@ any Fer@@ rel@@ l was shaken to its core .
just one day after she arrived in New York City , the St. Louis Bri@@ de sat on the bed of an Air@@ b@@ n@@ b flat she rented and sc@@ rolls through Facebook on her phone .
she stum@@ bled over a post by someone from high school .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the police have just killed a 18 @-@ year @-@ old child and it &apos;s still on the road , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said there . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
confused as nobody else posted the information on her feed , she closed Facebook and opened Twitter .
a user with the Hand@@ le @ the@@ e@@ Phar@@ o@@ ah was constantly rescu@@ ed at their tim@@ eline .
the ra@@ pper from the area of St. Louis was involved in twe@@ eting the death of Michael Brown , an un@@ armed Black 18 @-@ year @-@ old who was killed by a white police officer in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , Mo .
he posted a picture of Brown &apos;s lifel@@ ess body that was stretched out on the street and would stay there for four hours .
&quot; that &apos;s wild , &quot; Fer@@ rel@@ l thought with them .
but death was nothing new for them and their community .
she put her cell phone off to return later in the evening to twe@@ ets about people on the Can@@ field @-@ Drive .
there were photos of the police band and people crying , and from a man who claimed to be Brown &apos;s father who wore a sign with the inscription : &quot; F@@ erg@@ us@@ on police has just killed my un@@ armed son ! &quot;
she watched a live feed where a polic@@ eman stood in front of a group of demonstr@@ ators with a bark@@ ing dog .
in another video , she said , another polic@@ eman delivered his ri@@ f@@ le and cried : &quot; I will kill you ... animals all . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not common , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Fer@@ rel@@ l rec@@ alled her statement . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not the kind of murder we have become accustomed to and which we can name typical . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at that moment I felt ch@@ ills .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was angry and wept . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
she booked a return flight and went home the next day .
after the landing at 23 o &apos;clock , she took her 6 @-@ year @-@ old daughter from her father &apos;s house and decided that the two would go to F@@ erg@@ us@@ on the next morning .
what happened in the next three years with Fer@@ rel@@ l and F@@ erg@@ us@@ on is the subject of a new documentary film , &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? , &quot; in the cinem@@ as from the 11 .
it is a story of survival and protest , love and loss , strength and resili@@ ence that exists from the viewpoint of the people who live in the community and have filled the streets to demand answers .
when Fer@@ rel@@ l spoke to F@@ erg@@ us@@ on with her daughter , who carried a flower @-@ dress and a matching crown , the two had a conversation , which they had countless times before this morning &quot; about the black experience and the black state . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you remember how I have taught you when black people have to fight for what they believe ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she remembered what she said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we go to F@@ erg@@ us@@ on because the police killed a 18 @-@ year @-@ old boy and that wasn &apos;t right . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I could not take them away , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Fer@@ rel@@ l later . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what has happened today is a highlight of what happened in the past . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it must know and see it and be drawn up in it .
it must be well developed , not just activ@@ ism and organization , but also the various layers of black experience and the black constitution and what we must do to become free to free ourselves .
even if I am lucky enough to give her an experience in which she personally experiences no blat@@ ant rac@@ ism , she is no different from the next black women child .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I feel I would show you a bad service to keep them away . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the first station when they arrived in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on was on South Flor@@ iss@@ ant Road , a place opposite the police authority , which became a camp area when the activists were waiting for the possible non @-@ accus@@ ation of Officer Dar@@ ren Wilson .
there , Fer@@ rel@@ l and her daughter joined with a local owner who made lunch .
they prepared bags and helped to pass them on to demonstr@@ ators .
slowly a new kind of activ@@ ism began to take shape for Fer@@ rel@@ l .
&quot; my activ@@ ism changed totally after August 9 , &quot; she said , and noticed that she was a student at the University of Mis@@ sour@@ i @-@ St. Louis , President of the Min@@ ority Student Nur@@ ses Association and focused on eating justice and health ine@@ qualities in black commun@@ es .
&quot; I had no experience in organising .
everything has come . &quot;
weeks later , during an evening demonstration , Fer@@ rel@@ l met Sab@@ a@@ ah Fol@@ ay@@ an , one of the co @-@ directors of the film .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Fol@@ ay@@ an said they and their c@@ amer@@ aman Lucas Al@@ var@@ ado @-@ Far@@ ra@@ r wanted to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; document &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one question came Fer@@ rel@@ l in mind : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; do you want to document or try to find a story you can take advantage of ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this skep@@ ticism was nour@@ ished by countless cases of people , often by wh@@ ites - in a community that benefited from their pain and resili@@ ence .
as Fol@@ ay@@ an recently stated in an interview , &quot; We had heard that people born and raised in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on did not centre their voices and we wanted to do it differently . &quot;
Fol@@ ay@@ an had already worked with the co @-@ director Dam@@ on Davis , an artist from the area known for his activ@@ ism around To@@ de@@ stra@@ ked in@@ mates .
his engagement brought Fer@@ rel@@ l closer to the project , along with six other local people , the team of &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets &quot; followed in the years after Brow@@ ning &apos;s shooting .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this documentary is not someone who speaks for us or speaks to us . we &apos;re talking , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Davis . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was the main thing for me , as these people are portra@@ yed , for so I will be represented . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the goal was not to focus on Ferr@@ is &apos;s experience - to show that the movement &quot; is not a Messiah leader , but rather a community that comes together , &quot; said Fol@@ ay@@ an - it proved to be the most open participant in the film .
as a result , documents of &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets &quot; show surprising personal aspects of Ferr@@ is &apos;s life , as she falls in love with and mar@@ ries her wife .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I felt like naked , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Fer@@ rel@@ l and laugh@@ ed when she saw the finished product for the first time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I have understood that there must be a certain vulner@@ ability in this work and for the de@@ human@@ isation of black people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition , Ferr@@ is &apos;s story repe@@ ats the role of black gay women in the wider Black @-@ Li@@ ves @-@ Mat@@ ter movement .
two of the three founders of the movement , who have shaped the film &quot; Black@@ out Mat@@ ter &quot; in social media after the killing of the black teen@@ ager Tra@@ y@@ by Martin in 2012 , can be identified as gay .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; black , gay women in leadership positions have worn the movement altogether , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Fer@@ rel@@ l , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and so we are constantly fighting on different fron@@ ts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; black gay women must bear the brun@@ t of everything . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Fol@@ ay@@ an agreed to notice that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the movement is really maintained by black women and many black women . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but it insi@@ sts that &quot; this is not an affir@@ m@@ ative type of action , &quot; in which Fer@@ rel@@ l was selected as the heart of the film on the basis of her identity .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she was the person who sh@@ ook up this energy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s no coincidence , even though it was at the forefront because in life at these junc@@ tions as a black gay woman is so much on the game . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
you can feel their energy through the screen . &quot;
in the meantime , the news cameras in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on have disappeared long ago , but the racial ties between the church and the police continue to exist .
Fer@@ rel@@ l is on par@@ ole for 2 ½ years because of the blocking of a highway in a demonstration .
she describes the socio @-@ political atmosphere of the area she calls her home : &quot; chaos . &quot;
nevertheless she cl@@ ings to a chant and she feels bound to this memory since she went on the road three years ago in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is our duty to fight for our freedom . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is our duty to win .
we must love and support each other .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have nothing to lose - except our chains . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
from &quot; Dream &quot; to &quot; meg@@ al@@ om@@ ania &quot; : TV readers discuss bit @-@ gallery
the bit gallery moves people even though it hasn &apos;t been built for a long time .
but the idea of a shopping centre at the southern end of the pedestrian zone has since the first presentation in 2009 spl@@ its the population into advoc@@ ates and opponents .
the theme is hardly cold .
the topic is also discussed on our Facebook page &quot; Volks@@ fre@@ und Bit@@ burg . &quot;
while one speaks to the Bit Gallery : &quot; that would be a dream &quot; ( An@@ ja Becker ) or &quot; That would be really great &quot; ( Nicole Schau@@ sten ) , comes from the other side : &quot; no man needs &quot; ( Sig@@ gi B@@ etzen ) or quite simply : &quot; meg@@ al@@ om@@ ania ! &quot; ( Lars Sch@@ olz ) .
while the advoc@@ ates build a gallery to attract more customers to the city , of which the rest of the shops also profit , the opponents fear that the pedestrian zone will then ble@@ ed out .
in addition , the gallery is planned exactly on the property on which the farmers market hall is located in which 13 direct marketing products offer their products .
at the beginning of the construction work will be concluded .
the gallery @-@ makers want to integrate a market hall into the new building - to Bed@@ a @-@ Platz with possibility to sit outside .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sim@@ one Room : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have been shopping in the peasant market for many years now . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
mainly our eggs , but also the delicious cakes of the farm women always happy again .
we also discovered the but@@ cher &apos;s shop for us .
we would like to wish that even during and above all , after the construction of the gallery there is a chance to maintain this offer .
in other cities there is also .
especially the Klein@@ mark@@ thalle in Frankfurt is interesting . &quot;
Ger@@ d D@@ ens@@ ing : &quot; whether direct marketing in a market hall in the gallery res@@ ides , depends on the amount of rent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but this should probably not be very low in the new project . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Eva K@@ ili@@ c : &quot; what is the shopping centre in Bit@@ burg ?
whether clothing , shoes , dru@@ g@@ stores or supermarkets : I find that superf@@ lu@@ ous .
there are enough of them in our city .
you can see how many shops are empty here - some for months and years .
but since there is not even a regular weekly market , it is all the more important that at least the Mark@@ thalle remains available to us .
because after all the goods offered there are fresh , mostly offered directly by the producer and is also a good value for money .
as you can see , stores in a shopping mall are rented only by larger companies , because the local r@@ ents are often un@@ sustainable for a retailer .
too bad , there is almost no special business , and that which is still left will probably disappear . &quot;
wolf F@@ andel : &quot; a shopping mall with a market hall doesn &apos;t fit together for me .
and the gallery does not fit to Bit@@ burg .
first of all : where is the peasant market hall planned during the construction period ?
the old E@@ de@@ ka would be the solution - also in the long run if the bit gallery comes up some@@ time .
or does the spec@@ tra@@ l bit gallery succ@@ eeds in selling all the businesses from Bit@@ burg ? &quot;
George Mar@@ quet : &quot; it just won &apos;t work .
and no one needs a shopping center that stands empty .
in my opinion it would have been better to promote a real farmer &apos;s market instead of this gallery .
but for a peasant market hall there is no place in Bit@@ burg thanks to the unbeliev@@ ably many - as I find - sen@@ sel@@ ess construction projects in Bit@@ burg .
when the peasant market hall is destroyed , a piece of culture will disappear . &quot;
a matching simil@@ arity : artist creates portraits of Chelsea Mann@@ ing &apos;s DNA
in the middle of the space of the Fri@@ d@@ man Gallery in New York , many faces can be seen - white , black and brown , which are almost im@@ percep@@ tible - hang on cables from the ceiling .
the 30 portraits were created by the artist He@@ ather De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg from W@@ angen tu@@ bs and hair@@ cuts sent to her by Chelsea Mann@@ ing .
Mann@@ ing sent excer@@ pts from Fort Le@@ aven@@ worth prison , where the former intelligence analy@@ st served a 35 @-@ year prison term after she publicly disclosed diplomatic messages about Wiki@@ Le@@ aks &apos;s website .
the new exhibition opened on August 2 is called A Bec@@ oming &apos;s emb@@ lance ( A matching simil@@ arity ) .
she is the product of two years correspondence between De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg , whose discipline united her expertise in technology , computer science and art , and Mann@@ ing , a trans@@ man and a pioneering dissi@@ dent , whose conviction was transformed by Barack Obama when he had only three days in his ministry .
De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg has created an algorith@@ mic analysis of DNA extracted from man@@ ing and created from the 30 portraits , as someone with these gen@@ om@@ ic data could look like , a sharp albeit intellectual commentary not only to the formation of DNA data - the many ways they can be interpreted and the inherent determin@@ ism of these interpretations - but also for identity .
Mann@@ ing , who was born as Brad@@ ley Edward but had already spoken openly about the identification as a woman since pu@@ ber@@ ty , was convic@@ ted of 20 charges in 2013 , including six violations of the law of es@@ pion@@ age , computer fraud and theft .
her picture was supp@@ ressed by the prison , so much that there was only one photo - a gra@@ iny , black @-@ and @-@ white sel@@ f@@ ie , in which Mann@@ ing visi@@ bly sits un@@ well on a driver &apos;s seat and wearing a plat@@ in@@ blonde wig - with which she was associated .
in 2015 , De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg came from the great success of her 2012 &apos; Stran@@ ger Visi@@ ons &apos; project .
in this , the artist produced portraits of strangers from for@@ en@@ sic arti@@ facts such as cigarette but@@ ts and ch@@ ewing gum by extrac@@ ting DNA from waste to make a picture of how these people might look .
that was the time she received an email from a newspaper magazine .
&quot; they conducted an interview with Chelsea Mann@@ ing while she was in prison and wanted a kind of portrait to accompany this article , &quot; explained De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg in a press preview of the new exhibition .
and she could not be visited at that time and she could not be photographed , so she contacted Chelsea and asked her if she wanted to make a DNA portrait .
the artist and her imprisoned m@@ use became too un@@ equal letters exchanges , which over the course of two years exchanged several letters .
they even created a Com@@ ic &quot; Supp@@ ressed Images &quot; illustrated by Sho@@ il@@ i Kan@@ ung@@ o , who fores@@ aw a future in which the President of Chelsea would change judgment and would be able to see the exhibition personally .
that Obama was actually only a few days after the book was released to demand crew release after seven brutal years in a military prison in K@@ ans@@ as was a welcome sort of happy coincidence .
there is also a little deep and heavy at the opening of the exhibition , as Donald Tr@@ ump leads a war against in@@ forman@@ ts from the government camp and against Trans@@ atlan@@ tic troops to find new , twe@@ et@@ able ways to further infl@@ ame the rigid divisions that he should actually fix .
when De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg was asked about the strange timing of all these things , she said &quot; things happen for a certain reason . &quot;
in a artistic statement written down on the wall of the gallery , Mann@@ ing called for her signature ( the &quot; i &quot; in her family name with a heart ) an end to the &quot; automatic disper@@ sion , whose basis sex , race , sexu@@ ality and culture have been . &quot;
on the opposite wall is their mit@@ och@@ on@@ dri@@ al DNA sequence - a thous@@ and@@ th of Cs and Gs and As , written in pencil .
De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg hoped to show through the inclusion of the 200 letters ( or nucle@@ oti@@ des according to the highly developed scientific en@@ cyclo@@ pedia of the artist ) , as amaz@@ ingly similar , at least in biological terms , we are all .
&quot; what people will hopefully take with us is that our gen@@ ome does not care about who we are and how open genetic data is for an interpretation and how subj@@ ectively they are , &quot; said De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg , whose video work of 2007 , Sp@@ uri@@ ous Mem@@ ories , is also to be seen .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; DNA data can tell so many different stories , so the 30 stories are . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the last piece in the exhibition , which is stored in a separate room , is a page from the above mentioned comic @-@ novel .
it shows Mann@@ ing as she appears with a hands @-@ free talk in the hands of the disciplinary barracks of the United States such as King Kong .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when they kiss your speech , they have won . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; so never stop the mouth . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it came directly from a letter they wrote to me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the artist , who sal@@ utes Philadelphia . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I still get go@@ os@@ eb@@ um@@ ps when I talk about it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mann@@ ing has not seen the exhibition personally - as it was anticipated in the comic book - but if it should do it , it will be welcomed in the middle of the room by the masks , from her own gen@@ om@@ ic simul@@ ac@@ re , who rally like hor@@ des of prot@@ esters .
this was also aimed at how everything was written in the exhibition , up to size ( 5 &quot; 2 , Mann@@ ing St@@ ature ) , where their genetic hap@@ lo@@ groups were written with a pencil .
&quot; in the past I had them on the wall , but I wanted them to feel like a crowd , &quot; said De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg from the portraits .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I wanted it to feel like a mass movement that formed with Chelsea like the movement that was also behind its liberation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Professor of the University of Nor@@ th@@ western and an employee of the University of Oxford because of killing
a national human hunt is underway for a professor at Nor@@ th@@ western University and an employee of the University of Oxford who are looking for susp@@ ects after a man has been stab@@ bed to death in a luxurious residential apartment in Chicago .
on Monday , for W@@ yn@@ d@@ ham La@@ them ( 42 ) and Andrew War@@ ren ( 56 ) arrest warran@@ ts were issued for murder on account of their alleged involvement in the death of Tr@@ ent@@ on H. James Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au , as the acts of the District Court of Cook County show .
the documents tell that Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au , 26 , died after several stit@@ ches .
a communal warning system published by the Chicago Police Department states that the corp@@ se was discovered on 27 July .
officials received a call , arrived at the Grand Plaza Apartments and found the victim with several injuries to his body .
Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au was declared dead in the place of events , and det@@ ectives examine the stit@@ ches as murder , while the police actively seek the two susp@@ ects , officials said .
La@@ a has been an associate professor of micro@@ biology and immun@@ ology at Nor@@ th@@ western University since 2007 .
Alan K. Cub@@ ischer , vice @-@ president for university relations , said in an e @-@ mail statement that La@@ a must now be certified and excluded from entering the Nor@@ th@@ western University campus .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is now a criminal affair examined by the competent authorities and Nor@@ th@@ western University co @-@ operates with this investigation , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Cub@@ ischer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
War@@ ren is Senior Treas@@ ury Assistant at Oxford University .
a speaker of the University and Som@@ er@@ ville College said in an email statement that &quot; we are in contact with the police in the UK and are ready to help the US investig@@ ative authorities in any way possible . &quot;
the statement added that War@@ ren &apos;s colleagues were shocked and want him to stand .
chief Communications Officer of the Chicago Police Department , Anthony Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi , said he urged the susp@@ ects to face up to the authorities .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the police have an idea of their where@@ ab@@ outs , and our efforts to locate them reinforce , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said that local , regional and national authorities help to find the susp@@ ects .
Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said the police received a call from the building manager of the Grand Plaza building who had just received an en@@ ig@@ matic tip , saying that something happened in apartment 10@@ 08 .
the police described the scene very cruel .
Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said it was unclear whether the incident occurred on 27 July .
it was confirmed by security cameras that La@@ them and War@@ ren were in the building .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we believe Professor L@@ ath@@ am and the victim had a relationship , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the management team of Grand Plaza published an explanation to the residents : &quot; the police are currently working on the time axis and the background of the victim and expl@@ ores a multitude of motives , including a possible domestic incident . &quot;
&quot; we will complete the WA@@ DA timetable in the near future , &quot; - Russian Vice President Mut@@ ko
Russian Deputy Prime Minister Vital@@ y Mut@@ ko said it will not last long until the remaining criteria of the World Anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency ( WA@@ DA ) are implemented for the restoration of the Russian Anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency ( R@@ US@@ A@@ DA ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a certain stage of meeting the criteria of the road@@ map , R@@ US@@ A@@ DA has the right to plan and test in cooperation with U@@ K@@ AD ( UK Anti @-@ D@@ oping ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the WA@@ DA timetable was updated in this respect , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mut@@ ko on Thursday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the PM quoted the second part of the WA@@ DA schedule to comply with the code describing the criteria for the re @-@ release of R@@ US@@ A@@ DA and recently published on the organisation &apos;s website .
according to Mut@@ ko , he doesn &apos;t have anything to concern for Russia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; everything was announced , everything is being implemented . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and the results will be presented to the International Olympic Committee ( IO@@ C ) and WA@@ DA in the near future , &quot; he added .
however , one of the criteria listed in the list indicates that Russian anti @-@ dop@@ ing authorities must publicly accept the reported results of the investigation approved by the WA@@ DA by Canadian solic@@ itor Richard Mc@@ L@@ aren to state subsidi@@ zed dop@@ ing in Russian sports .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mut@@ ko said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we carry out the investigation because our anti @-@ dop@@ ing system got an error . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
all measures have been implemented .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but there were no government programs and we won &apos;t give anything that doesn &apos;t exist . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mut@@ ko &apos;s words coinci@@ ded with those of Vital@@ y Sm@@ ir@@ nov , the leader of the independent Russian Anti @-@ D@@ oping Commission .
in conversation with the Russian sales office r@@ sport at the beginning of the day Sm@@ ir@@ nov gave problems of the past in Russian anti @-@ dop@@ ing organizations , but added : &quot; we have repeatedly said that the report contains controversial positions and regulations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no one pre@@ tends to accept this report un@@ condition@@ ally , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; added Sm@@ ir@@ nov . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in November 2015 , R@@ US@@ A@@ DA was excluded from the implementation of dop@@ ing controls in Russia as part of the dop@@ ing sc@@ andal .
however , it was allowed to plan and coordinate tests under the supervision of international experts and the UK Anti @-@ D@@ oping ( U@@ K@@ AD ) .
after a visit to the headquarters of the Moscow organization in July , WA@@ DA General Director Oli@@ vier Nig@@ gli stated that R@@ US@@ A@@ DA moved &quot; in the right direction &quot; to be used again .

the start @-@ ups that will help your company not become the next U@@ ber
A@@ my Er@@ ret@@ t wanted to measure luck at your e @-@ commerce start @-@ up , but the surveys did not work .
answers were often vag@@ ue , little helpful , or worse - dec@@ eit@@ ful .
and even if you promised anonym@@ ity some workers did not trust the process .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there was simply never consistency and obj@@ ectivity , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Er@@ ret@@ t , who runs the 75 @-@ person San Francisco e @-@ Commerce Hair Care Association Ma@@ dison Re@@ ed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
she called people from outside for help .
a new Human Resource start @-@ up race is growing to help companies find out how their employees feel .
by creating and licensing software that has the specific purpose of measuring employee engagement , it enables companies to conduct surveys , to offer special groups and demographic groups , employees anonym@@ ity and complaint hot@@ lines , and in some cases whi@@ st@@ le@@ blo@@ wers allow to circum@@ vent the C @-@ Suite executives and turn directly to the Board of Directors .
&quot; you now have tools like Stra@@ va and Fit@@ bit for tracking their health , but where is the Fit@@ bit for your company ? &quot; said Jim Bar@@ nett , co @-@ founder and Chief Executive of Red@@ wood City Start @-@ up G@@ LIN@@ T , whose software analytics tools are used by companies to measure employees commitment .
Er@@ ret@@ t said that she gained a better insight into what your employees think and feel in the three years with G@@ LIN@@ T .
in addition to the snap @-@ surveys and surveys of certain teams , it offers a heat map of the company that shows at a glance which units have most complaints and which executives have low appro@@ vals - so that you can re@@ boot , why .
companies are coming to see that they have to stay at the top of the workplace culture so that you won &apos;t be the next U@@ ber involved in sc@@ and@@ als since a former employee has published a blog post that describes an environment of nu@@ is@@ ances , in which those who have spoken are punished .
for start @-@ ups such as G@@ LIN@@ T , this wish for an overview is a lu@@ cr@@ ative business opportunity .
the Global Governance , Regulation and Compliance industry could have more than $ 1@@ 18.@@ 7 billion in 2020 , according to the financial website Let &apos;s Talk Pay@@ ments .
Den@@ ver , Colorado , Start @-@ up Con@@ ver@@ cent , the company helps to prevent bad behavior and recognize , saw an increasing interest and activity at the beginning of this year in the middle of the U@@ ber @-@ F@@ alles in Mis@@ sk@@ re@@ dit .
cent has nearly 600 clients including Air@@ b@@ n@@ b , Microsoft and Tes@@ la .
recently , the client registered as a client .
like G@@ LIN@@ T , Con@@ ver@@ cent can send customized &quot; pulse &quot; surveys , collect sensitive responses in real time and view the heat maps of your problem areas .
it also provides an anonymous SMS hot@@ line that allows staff to report poor behavior .
and if the main business leader is involved , complaints go directly to the Supervisory Board .
&quot; the court of public opinion has captured the regul@@ ators , &quot; said Patrick Qu@@ in@@ lan , the founder and managing director of Con@@ ver@@ cent .
when a company finds its employees badly treated or beha@@ ved un@@ ethical , it can experience costly consequences by consumer boy@@ cot@@ t , employee fluctu@@ ation and complaints , said Qu@@ in@@ lan .
Ru@@ by Tuesday , the restaurant chain with more than 25,000 employees and over 500 locations , has implemented Con@@ ver@@ cent for more than a year to ensure that employees are aware of policies and procedures and have an easy way to achieve their corporate headquarters .
earlier , if an employee wanted to report a problem , he or she had to find a phone number or email for the company headquarters , submit a formal complaint and hope that he was taken seriously .
it was often an in@@ timi@@ dation and uncomfortable experience , said James Vit@@ rano , Ru@@ by Tu@@ es@@ days General Co@@ uns@@ el who said there was no good way to track the complaints of employees .
now that the company uses Con@@ ver@@ cent , problems that were previously hidden by managers who were sitting in offices in cities or states - such as discrimination , har@@ ass@@ ment or unfair practi@@ c@@ - quicker identified and addressed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I can approach this holistic , 360 @-@ degree view of experience with employment , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Vit@@ rano , who leads the risk management group from Ru@@ by Tuesday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and we protect our shareholders against employment disputes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
companies began to take Eth@@ ics , Val@@ ues and Emplo@@ ye@@ es Engagement in 2002 after the accounting firm Arthur Ander@@ sen collap@@ sed because of ethical violations by the En@@ ron sc@@ andal , Qu@@ in@@ lan said .
but it took until the &quot; social media came to their right &quot; that companies realized that they could not prevent their dirty laundry going online .
&quot; before using technology to monitor ethics , people used hope as a strategy , &quot; he said .
both G@@ LIN@@ T and Con@@ ver@@ cent offer their software as a service and burden the companies with recurring charges for the use of their products .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a business model and a chance to find the approval of venture capital investors that have supported both start @-@ ups . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
con@@ ver@@ cent received $ 10 million in financing in February of companies such as S@@ apphire Vent@@ ures and T@@ ola Capital , raising the total capital to $ 47 million .
gl@@ itz@@ ers secured himself $ 10 million in November of B@@ ess@@ emer &apos;s Venture Partners and brought his total funding to $ 60 million .
these investments are hardly surprising given the connected nature of enterprises , culture and venture capital .
there is a growing research complex that shows that today &apos;s employees expect more from their jobs than before .
high sal@@ aries and interesting projects are only used in competitive markets such as Si@@ licon Valley .
the employees want to feel that you are accepted and appreciated and that you give your time to a company with a positive mission .
&quot; when people are happy to be in a company , feel that their voices are worth it , and that the work you do is worth doing , &quot; said Nina Mc@@ Queen , Vice President of Global Ben@@ ef@@ its and Emplo@@ ye@@ e Experience on Link@@ ed@@ In , which uses both Con@@ ver@@ cent and G@@ LIN@@ T .
investors gain margins when their portfolio companies are running well . companies are running well when employees are committed and engaged .
if the analytics tools of third parties promise to increase commitment and commitment to employees , it is no wonder that you will find support .
the data on employee engagement is important according to the workplace culture experts .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but the data is useless if the car@@ et@@ aker of a company does not take action . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in fact , if a company asks staff for your feedback , there may be a expectation that change is on the way .
and if the changes are not fast enough , or not at all , this can cause dis@@ appointments and dem@@ oti@@ fy employees .
&quot; if you ask about 4,000 questions , you must be ready to have 4,000 conversations , &quot; said Rus@@ sell Ra@@ ath , President of Consulting at the Business Management company Kot@@ ter International , who has seen companies that have too much reli@@ ed on collecting data .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because if you do not follow employee , ask , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Have you really heard me ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
do you care about it ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and if you don &apos;t care about it , why should I ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ma@@ dison Re@@ ed , who now carries out monthly employee surveys , has been able to initiate actions on the same day if a problem is reported on G@@ LIN@@ T , says Er@@ ret@@ t .
and after collecting feedback from frustr@@ ated employees , it was through the speed of decision making and the quality of communication , capable of re@@ organizing several teams within the company and adding a communication training to address the problems .
with Ru@@ by Tuesday , the company will always receive new insights into employees , and it hopes that in the long run , this leads to a better engagement of employees in an industry known for high turnover .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you are not oblig@@ ated to create a culture of transparency , you will lose people , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Vit@@ rano . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and if you lose people , you also lose customers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and if you lose customers , then you will lose business .
the N@@ CA@@ A solves the two @-@ day practices and makes a long day for the Brotherhood
it &apos;s about 11@@ pm when a lot of U@@ C@@ LA football players enter@@ tain themselves on one side of the new practice areas of the team on the campus .
some have pulled out their jer@@ sey parts and show the back full of sweat from the first day of the training camp .
for a good part of the team these idle minutes constitute a lunch break .
players who are enrolled in the summer courses will return to their final examinations after the three @-@ hour exercise before returning to the Water@@ man Football Center the next morning at 6 : 30 am .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a real treadmill for the boys , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bru@@ ins @-@ Trainer Jim Mor@@ a just before Monday became Tuesday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the N@@ CA@@ A eliminates two @-@ day exercises to ease the load of the players , and it has actually prolonged their days - at least until the final on Friday .
therefore , the first three trainings of the U@@ C@@ LA should start at 19 : 15 in order to meet the already packed schedules of the players .
the compromise from the two days is more than a day when the Bru@@ ges shifted the beginning of the camp almost a week after the last season and during the summer school for the first time during Mor@@ as six playing times in West@@ wood conducted practical exercises .
they are supposed to hold 18 exercises during August . 20 before the start of the formal game preparations for their pr@@ el@@ ude to Texas A &amp; M in September .
Mor@@ a said he supports the change in regulation of the N@@ CA@@ A even if they add another point to the busy routes of the players .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we put this enormous strain on them three or four days , and it is very challenging , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mor@@ a . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and they simply pushed it through , they plac@@ ate further , they are great people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think as soon as we come to Saturday and we have more time , it will be really great . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the U@@ C@@ LA will finish its practice as soon as the camp is finished , which is not an easy task given the clear line of lines of its fields from an adjacent car park and the adjacent Lus@@ kin Center , a hotel of the elevated class that has already cleared an enclosure net behind a tor@@ ped@@ o .
bro@@ ins players are said to occupy the hotel this weekend , but Mor@@ a admitted that there could be a problem as soon as these rooms are free during the season .
&quot; we will use our security , &quot; said Mor@@ a .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a real problem and it is not far fet@@ ched to think that people will rent a room and then choose to record an exercise . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if you have the vide@@ ot@@ ape from an exercise , it &apos;s a pretty good deal .
but we have security forces there and we have security forces on parking 8 .
we will do the best with what we have .
that &apos;s why I don &apos;t worry too much .
we have a plan . &quot;
Facebook wants to intensi@@ fy facts review in the fight against fake messages
Facebook wants to send more potential articles with false reports from third parties and then display their results in the original article , the world &apos;s largest online social network announced on Thursday . it is one of its efforts to combat so @-@ called fake news .
the company said in a statement on its website that it will begin with the use of updated machine learning methods to identify possible false reports and to send them to fac@@ tual reviews , which may display results of the fact test out of the original article .
Facebook was critic@@ ised as one of the main distribution points for so @-@ called fake news , many of whom believe that they also influenced the 2016 US presidential elections .
the problem has also become a major political issue in Europe , with French voters being flooded with false stories in the run @-@ up to the presidential elections in May , and Germany supports a plan to be punished according to social media networks if they fail to quickly eliminate hat@@ eful post@@ ings as before the elections there in September .
on Thursday , Facebook announced in a separate statement in English that a test of the new facts review will be launched in the USA , France , the Netherlands and Germany .
&quot; in addition to realizing what stories are challenged by fac@@ tual reviews of third parties , people want more context to make informed decisions about what they read and share , &quot; said Sara S@@ u , Product Manager for Facebook news in a blog .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she added that Facebook continues to test its feature on the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; connected article &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and works on other changes to its news feed to reduce false news . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
creating a comic novel : a castle in the history of England
in his younger past , the little Scot@@ ney Castle was seen in a squee@@ ze music video and was a lo@@ op@@ hole for Margar@@ et T@@ hat@@ cher in the 1970 &quot; s and 1980 &apos;s .
but Scot@@ ney has experienced 700 years of turbul@@ ent history from his cozy seat in the Bew@@ are River Valley in K@@ ent and has now become an inspiration for a graphic novel by Jamie Rho@@ des , a cosm@@ opol@@ itan Yor@@ k@@ shi@@ re@@ man with a preference for historical documents .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I find it so nice to look at the signature of someone who has been dead for 300 years , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says bitter@@ ly . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what a personal relationship to keep this letter in my hand . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&apos;@@ A Castle in England &apos; sp@@ ans the time from the Middle Ages to the age of Edward and documents the families living in Scot@@ ney . each story was illustrated by another British artist coming up - Isaac steering ie@@ wi@@ cz , Bri@@ ony May Smith , William Ex@@ ley , Beck@@ y Pal@@ mer and Isa@@ bel Gre@@ enberg .
it is not the first book of Rho@@ des based on an archive : he wrote &apos; Dead Men &apos;s Te@@ eth and Other Stories &apos; , a collection inspired by documents in the British Library - a project that he found un@@ expect@@ edly emotional .
&quot; I just re@@ acted to the thumb print on the side of a letter that was written by a double agent in the 1700 &apos;s , who worked for the Jacob@@ ins , &quot; he says .
&quot; this is his thumb print !
and letters always smell smoke , for at that time a fire was kind@@ led because of the light .
for someone who lives 300 years later , the smell has an effect as if he were there himself .
Oh , I love archives ! &quot;
for someone who is so beaten with old papers that he is supported by the National Trust and the Arts Council England and lived in a castle for almost four months ( &quot; To be honest : I have over@@ rated my welcome @-@ greeting &quot; ) seems to be all too beautiful to be true .
Rho@@ des spent his days exploring the Victori@@ an &quot; new &quot; castle , viewing the archives and studying the many treasures and curi@@ osi@@ ties of the castle , such as the mounted hy@@ ena heads on the walls and the bottles that had been spent centuries in dig@@ ging .
he walked through the terrain and the ruins of the old castle and spoke with landscape fl@@ ares , gar@@ den@@ ers and sometimes with the artists who worked on the illustrations of his book .
then at night he d@@ rank whis@@ key and started writing . &quot;
the intimate story of Scot@@ ney is relatively unknown because the National Trust was granted full access only in 2006 when the last heir , Elizabeth Hus@@ sey , died .
when Rho@@ des arrived a decade later , the employees just started to take care of the archive , which he described as &quot; hundreds of years , in which aristo@@ cr@@ ats said &quot; Oh , throw it on the attic . &quot;
di@@ aries , letters from the period of English Emp@@ ires , cards that represent who possessed something : &quot; one could think that land conflicts would be boring , &quot; Rho@@ des says , &quot; but there was a bir@@ ch to fight the two families .
guys , let &apos;s go all the way ! &quot;
some of the stories in the collection use the castle as a starting point to dive into English history , including &apos; The Lab@@ our@@ er &apos; , which follows a man who leaves the newly built castle to join the peasant uprising of 13@@ 81 .
&quot; there is a record of a revol@@ t that occurred in the castle in 13@@ 80 , in this book entitled &apos; Kni@@ gh@@ tly Family of K@@ ent and Sus@@ sex &apos; , &quot; Rho@@ des says .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the uprising started in this area and I thought that an insurrection was a good start . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
perhaps they are connected with each other ? &quot;
other stories are firmly rooted in the history of the castle - like &apos; The Pri@@ est &apos; , which tells the story of the Jesu@@ it pat@@ rons that the Dar@@ rel@@ l family hid for seven years during the English Reformation .
or &apos; The S@@ mu@@ g@@ gler &apos; , in which the smu@@ g@@ gler Arthur Dar@@ rel@@ l is portra@@ yed from the 18th century , who st@@ aging his own funeral by filling a coff@@ in with stones ( a discovery that was made years later when his coff@@ in was dug out ) .
the Dar@@ r@@ ells are Rho@@ des &apos;s favourite family of Scot@@ ney : &quot; gentlemen seemed to be quite cro@@ ok , always making debts and spending money on things they could not afford .
other generations of Dar@@ rel@@ l men reli@@ ed on their debt crises by mar@@ rying rich old women - I imagine them as a bunch of well @-@ looking guys , with a talent to recru@@ it vom@@ iting . &quot;
after the end of his commitment in the castle Rho@@ des is searching for other unique writing experiences
he has had a two @-@ week stay in the Finnish wilderness for a comic novel about E@@ lä@@ män@@ mä@@ ki , the site of a san@@ atorium from the early 20th century , which has since been rec@@ laimed by nature .
but Scot@@ ney has a special place for him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was sad to go back , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was like &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Oh , now I have to deal with the dam@@ ned life again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
campaign launched : over 300 years old Mari@@ enk@@ ap@@ elle en@@ closes in Rh@@ ön@@ dorf
with the eiling of the 301 @-@ year old Mari@@ enk@@ ap@@ elle in Rh@@ ön@@ dorf , the town of Bad Honne@@ f has launched its campaign to introduce a new umbrella brand ( Rund@@ schau from Thursday ) .
by Thursday , mayor Otto Neu@@ hoff and his marketing team headed by Nelson Ar@@ tz want to keep the logo and slogan secret .
at the end of August there will be a festival on the Isle of Gra@@ fen@@ wer@@ th as the cul@@ mination of the campaign .
&quot; too nice for us .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the makers of the campaign have been asking for the posters at the Rh@@ ön@@ dorfer Chapel yesterday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we don &apos;t really think that ( of course ! ) &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; they write on their yesterday released web site . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but we use this measure to gain your attention . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and to make it clear that some things are better than it seems .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; basically we are the firm conviction that we as Bad Honne@@ f citizens know very well about the beauty and attrac@@ tiveness of our city . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the action is more than &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; just &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a logo and a slogan , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is important to form@@ ulate a single @-@ standing promise , one that gives the city a distinctive unique feature . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
finally they are competing with other local authorities .
the city of Bad Honne@@ f will cost an average five @-@ digit amount for its new umbrella brand and campaign .
military reforms in Turkey - Erdo@@ gan &apos;s fear of the army
every year at the beginning of August , the Supreme Military Council ( Y@@ AS ) advises on boarding and transport in the officer cor@@ ps .
so also this week .
at first sight a normal process .
but nothing is routine with the Turkish forces one year after the coup attempt .
the meeting was not held in the headquarters of the General Staff , as in the past , but at the presi@@ dency of the Prime Minister .
the meetings took place under the presi@@ dency of the He@@ ads of Government now also the five Deputy Prime Ministers and the Defence , Home Affairs , Justice and Foreign Affairs Ministers .
this was the number of civilians in the Y@@ AS .
the government tigh@@ tened the re@@ ins in the military .
the chief of staff , Hul@@ us@@ i Ak@@ ar , remained in office , but the officers of the army , the Air Force and the Navy were dismissed .
since the failed coup , head of state Erdo@@ gan 169 has fired 3@@ 26 gener@@ als and admir@@ als .
more than 10,000 soldiers were removed from the ranks of the army - mostly due to alleged connections to the movement of the ex@@ iled pre@@ acher Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len , who sees Erdo@@ gan as a leader of the coup attempt .
against 4@@ 86 persons who have been directly involved in the coup attempt , Ankara has been negotiated in Ankara since this week .
already on the day after the coup , Erdo@@ gan had designated the overthrow of a &quot; God present , &quot; as he gave him the opportunity to &quot; clean@@ se the armed forces . &quot;
but Erdo@@ gan actually has the army under control ?
at the end of February , the paper &quot; Hür@@ ri@@ yet &quot; published an article entitled &quot; Un@@ ease in Military Head@@ quarters . &quot;
in the general staff there are concerns about an increasing &quot; Islam@@ ization &quot; of the army , which , among other things , mani@@ f@@ ests itself in the lifting of the head@@ set prohibition for soldiers , the newspaper wrote .
in any case , the major coach of the army and the security forces continues .
in mid @-@ July , Erdo@@ gan , by decree , ordered more 7@@ 3@@ 95 national servants , including 230@@ 3 polic@@ emen and 5@@ 46 soldiers .
it seemed as though Erdo@@ gan had t@@ amed the military .
the gener@@ als were formerly considered to be the real masters of the country .
three times they appeal to their role as guar@@ dians of the secular state order .
after his election victory in 2002 , Erdo@@ gan pushed back the power of the military step by step , not least of his appeal to the reform targets of the European Union .
former officers say Erdo@@ gan is target@@ ing a mobili@@ zation of the armed forces .
in the magazine &quot; Vo@@ cal Europe , &quot; a particularly un@@ named officer who sought refuge after the coup attempt in fear of persecution in foreign countries , the Turkish army would be &quot; full extre@@ mi@@ sts and Sal@@ a@@ fi@@ sts in just a few years . &quot;
if this is true , such a development could not leave NATO cold .
in any case , there is doubt in the alliance after the cleansing of the Turkish army .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; leadership structures and operational skills are &quot; weakened &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; say NATO diplom@@ ats . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Washington changes the rules for the Green Card
there will be a new US immigration plan to change the Green Card rules , said President Donald Tr@@ ump , cited by the media .
it envis@@ ages lowering legal immigrants to 50,000 per year , stric@@ ter rules on obtaining vis@@ as for temporary work permits and restrictions for families @-@ oriented vis@@ as .
the new rules are proposed by the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans and supported by the President .
the draft bill is to be discussed in the two chambers of the Congress .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this law will reduce poverty , raise wages and save billions of dollars for tax@@ pay@@ ers and will do so by changing the way citizens are issued from other countries &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Green Cards &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the law will prevent chain migration and replace the current system . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this new application procedure will benefit candidates who speak English who have the financial means to support themselves and show knowledge that will benefit our economy , &quot; said Tr@@ ump , cited by the American media .
Ministry wants to rehabil@@ itate track for race car shuttle
again and again over the past few months over the future of the racing shuttle had been fought - now it should go very quickly .
before the end of the year , the route on which the tourist train runs , is to be built on the route .
in order to secure the future of the racing shuttle in the long run , construction work on the track should begin again this year according to the Ministry of Transport .
&quot; with the decision to further order and rehabil@@ itate the Il@@ men@@ au @-@ Renn@@ stei@@ g route , the country comm@@ its itself to this particularly important link for tourism , &quot; said Secretary of State Klaus S@@ üh@@ l on Friday in Er@@ furt .
the cost of rep@@ airing the route was reduced to about 2.5 million euros .
from this sum , the country will take 75 percent .
the contract , on the basis of which the shuttle will also be ordered by the country in the future , will be fin@@ alised at the moment , declared S@@ üh@@ l .
the Ministry and the South Thur@@ in@@ gia railway as operator agree on the technical details already .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this means that the road@@ map , the vehicles used and the quality standards are negotiated , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; S@@ üh@@ l said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the planned contract between the ministry and the railway company will be closed for a period of eleven years .
this makes the race platform shuttle be ordered regularly on December 2017 .
the Renn@@ stei@@ g @-@ Shuttle is a popular rail link between the Il@@ men@@ au and Renn@@ stei@@ g railway stations .
over the past few months , a pilot plant has been tested to determine whether the route is being used by a large number of people to order them regularly in the future .
the track is also heavily b@@ ump@@ y in parts .
the rise of sex robots is real and we should be worried
just as you thought it can &apos;t become even more crazy in 2017 , a new report about the technological developments in the area of sex robots .
yes , actually .
sex robots are currently a great thing .
recently , the Foundation for Respon@@ sible Robot@@ ics ( FR@@ R ) published a report on the development of sex robots in the next five to ten years .
according to No@@ el Sh@@ ark@@ ey , Emer@@ itus Professor of Robot@@ ics and Arti@@ ficial Intelligence at She@@ ff@@ iel@@ d University and co @-@ founder of the FR@@ R , we must begin taking Ascension seriously .
customers can choose the eye color of the robot , its shape of the ni@@ pp@@ le and the type of f@@ ing@@ ern@@ ail .
&quot; people make fun of it , but the companies deliver a lot of it , and we will see them much more often , &quot; Mr. Sh@@ ark@@ ey said in the publication of his new report .
modern sex d@@ olls have evolved from their infl@@ atable partners to robots with a silicone membrane that feels warm - with consciously human reactions that are achieved by artificial intelligence .
the user can also &quot; adjust &quot; his robot according to his beliefs , and select everything from the eye color of the robot over the shape of the ni@@ p@@ ples to the type or color of his f@@ ing@@ ern@@ ails .
but it becomes more trou@@ bling as many robots have the &quot; personalities &quot; that would make a step@@ ford woman look progressive .
modern sex d@@ olls have developed to robots with a silicone skin .
for example , the Real@@ B@@ oti@@ x robot allows its users to adapt their robots to the properties they find appealing such as sh@@ y@@ ness .
and then there are the Ro@@ xx@@ x@@ xe gold sex robots developed by True Compan@@ ion with pre @-@ programmed personalities like &quot; Fri@@ gi@@ d Far@@ rah , &quot; which con@@ veys the impression of sh@@ y@@ ness and &quot; Wild W@@ end@@ y &quot; with an &quot; adventurous &quot; personality .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ro@@ xx@@ xy Gold has a personality that is as good as possible to your personality , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; enth@@ uses the True Compan@@ ion website . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
so she likes what you like , and she doesn &apos;t like what you don &apos;t like , etc .
she also has her mo@@ ods in the course of the day - just like real people !
she can be tired , be fixed to conversation or she can &quot; be in mood ! &quot;
there are many disturbing aspects of this rise of sex robots - not least because they replace real human relationships - but the sub@@ servi@@ ent feminine tra@@ its , the all@@ u@@ sions to rape , when one takes a step towards Fri@@ gi@@ d ( here : reluc@@ tant ) Far@@ rah , are troubled at most .
true Compan@@ ion Ro@@ xx@@ xy has a vibr@@ ator on his website , but for men .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if women ( sic ) can have a vibr@@ ator , why can men then have no Ro@@ xx@@ xy ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , these sex robots are not just a fe@@ tish or just another sex toy .
their origin and their increasing sophisti@@ cation point to something darker and deeper in our culture , on a retreat from the ideal of gender equality towards a desire for sex with submission as an optional en@@ core .
most men will of course not hold any sex robots , and while the FR@@ R noted their rising popularity , they remain on the br@@ ink of consumer culture .
but what se@@ eps out of the marginal areas can be very instruc@@ tive regarding the spirit of the time in which we live .
and many people are not odd or insul@@ ting until the free market gives them permission .
there is a certain over@@ lap that these highly developed sex robots occur in a time in which the rights of women are threatened worldwide , in which there is a president in the White House who has been bo@@ asting to have women sexually ass@@ aul@@ ted .
the most dre@@ ad@@ ful aspect of the TV series &apos; The Hand@@ maid &apos;s T@@ ale &apos; ( &apos; The Report of the maid &apos; ) are not the graphical images , the worn body and the st@@ och@@ ro@@ me eyes , but how realistic this vision works .
the Republic of Gilead is a leap , but at the moment it does not feel like a great leap .
the goal behind these sex robots is to make a physical lik@@ eness to actual women as realistic as possible ( albeit with por@@ no@@ star proportions ) .
their builders want them to feel human that they im@@ itate the movement of a real body .
but , when it comes to their &quot; personalities , &quot; the robots are not real women .
they cannot separate themselves from their companion or simply walk away .
they have no intermedi@@ ation or background story , nothing that hin@@ ders independence or anything that could distur@@ b the fantasy of total submission .
in other words , they are fake slaves .
or to express it in the speech of 2017 : ma@@ ids
tr@@ um@@ ps great performance ?
he makes Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney the ep@@ it@@ ome of common sense
it has become a tru@@ ism of the Tr@@ ump era that the political divisions that pol@@ arized the US voters have also split families in small format .
there were newspapers around Christmas and Th@@ ank@@ sgiving in the USA with advice on how to deal with the horror of Tr@@ ump @-@ choosing relatives .
we are all committed to cutting off our filter bags .
less noticed is the power of Tr@@ um@@ ps to bring together families .
I mention this because my c@@ ousin , a le@@ ft@@ less poet who lives in Chicago and has long been busy with the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans in our family , visited me this week in New York .
it reminded me that the unity against a common enemy can have a powerful effect .
with Tr@@ ump in the White House , everyone whom she knows , including the republi@@ can relationship , with which she strug@@ gled for decades for politics , suddenly and quite peculi@@ arly on the same side .
for the dining table this is certainly a good thing , but it falls to me in a further context that this also ent@@ ails considerable risks .
the left has been strengthened by Tr@@ ump , but the horri@@ fying effect of his presi@@ dency has the power to push us all to the right .
when we speak of &quot; norm@@ alization &quot; and &quot; tr@@ ump , &quot; we refer to the gr@@ ati@@ fying possibility that his k@@ itt@@ ens won &apos;t be rep@@ elled one day .
however , there is an even more difficult long @-@ term scenario in which Tr@@ ump Rep@@ ublic@@ ans of the right wing &quot; norm@@ alize , &quot; which suddenly appear as the ep@@ it@@ ome of reason@@ abl@@ eness in comparison to its standards .
I find myself today attacked by an active nostal@@ gia for Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney &apos;s original version of the decline - the dog on the car roof , the 14 % income tax ( but at least we knew how his tax return looked like ) - both of which are in fact a very mild crime compared to tr@@ ump .
when Tr@@ ump goes , the next candidate of the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans must be mentally healthy in order to qualify as im@@ meas@@ urable improvement .
when my c@@ ousin was in the city , we brought our kids to the car@@ ous@@ el in Central Park , the largest of the car@@ ou@@ sels of the New York car park department , and the best three dollars you can spend in the city if you don &apos;t need caffeine .
the horses are huge , the fi@@ ber@@ glass designs on the central cylinder - all c@@ low@@ ns are tight and the animals turn out to look full of fear over their own shoulders - extremely dark and the climatic music con@@ veys this in a curious way .
so many c@@ lich@@ és of a city dis@@ appoint : the views of tall buildings become old , the sky@@ lines are too familiar to offer much excitement , and the reality of the city does not do justice to the dream .
thirty @-@ five years later , and I am still not quite over the day when I found out that Swiss Cot@@ tage is indeed not a Swiss Cot@@ tage - the Top@@ ic Pub Ye Ol@@ de Swiss Cot@@ tage does not count - but a big round@@ about in northern London .
but the Central Park car@@ ous@@ el is still a strange magic experience , because here two @-@ year @-@ old , an 11 @-@ year @-@ old and two women in the 40 @-@ s can go on it and have all a great time .
if I could have evaluated the car@@ ous@@ el I would have given him the full score , but luckily nobody asked for it .
on the other hand , this week , I was forced to evaluate my &quot; experience &quot; with transactions on a scale of one to five stars before I could pass my credit card .
in the coffee house at the corner of my street it is the same , plus the option to balance the rating with a 15 % tip - this to buy something about the counter .
this not only leads to a slow@@ down of what actually should be a neutral exchange , but also ex@@ erts pressure on the server to bring personality into a situation where none is required .
the poor woman in the department store was ap@@ pre@@ h@@ ensive , while I tired the experience to reach her my credit card with five stars .
Oscar Pist@@ ori@@ us transferred from prison to hospital with chest pain
Pist@@ ori@@ us left the prison for a hospital visit for the second time .
last year , he was brought to hospital for the treatment of cuts on his w@@ ri@@ sts , according to the prison authorities , according to a case in his cell .
Pist@@ ori@@ us was convic@@ ted of murder after an appeal by the prosec@@ ut@@ ors against a first death sentence .
he killed Ste@@ enk@@ amp in the early hours of Valent@@ ine &apos;s Day in 2013 , placing them on them several times through a door of the toilet cabin in his house in Pre@@ tori@@ a .
Pist@@ ori@@ us claimed that he kept his girlfriend for a noc@@ tur@@ nal intru@@ der hiding in the cabin .
the prosec@@ ut@@ ors announced their intention to appeal this time to the six @-@ year sentence of Pist@@ ori@@ us App@@ ell , of whom they say they are too len@@ i@@ ent .
the National Prosec@@ ution Service said that it would appeal to the Supreme Court of South Africa and the appeal could be heard this year .
Pist@@ ori@@ us is at risk that his sentence will be increased to 15 years if the prosec@@ ut@@ ors are successful .
there is no death penalty in South Africa .
as a farmer Arnold finds a strange egg
as the last of the Blum@@ berg schools , the four @-@ quarters were sent from arch@@ ers and don@@ keys to the holidays and to the secondary schools .
three of the students will go to high school in the future , four to the secondary school .
on Tuesday evening school director An@@ geli@@ ka S@@ itte welcomed the parents and representatives of the public at the Bürger@@ haus Bi@@ es@@ ental in E@@ pf@@ en@@ ho@@ fen .
the 29 pupils of the four classes , led by Sophi@@ a Schumacher and Reg@@ ine Me@@ der , chose a young eagle rising up in the poultry farm , but then released into freedom .
to do this , the lively band performed a musical with the title &quot; The Eagle in the poultry farm . &quot;
farmer Arnold found a strange egg , and left it out of his chi@@ ckens .
instead of a chicken @-@ k@@ ens , a little eagle came out .
but the hope of making him a chicken sh@@ attered , and the eagle had spread its wings on a high mountain and s@@ wore .
after that , the classes showed three and four in the study of Y@@ von@@ ne Frank a chicken dance .
the h@@ ens d@@ anced with the young go@@ ck@@ les carrying cylinders to the bet .
the Adler stands for integration , said school director An@@ geli@@ ka S@@ itte .
the kit@@ ten is different from the other k@@ itt@@ ens ( chi@@ cks ) , but belongs to it .
but he will never be like a chicken .
his determination is to be free .
she wished each fourth @-@ vessel to feel accepted in his new school .
this was followed by a message of thanks to colleagues , former school manager Michael Müller , who repeatedly came up with teaching pas@@ sports , and the par@@ ental representatives .
the time of cooking was over , class teacher Sophi@@ a Schumacher .
after two years of teaching , she was very reluc@@ tant to teach her students because it was a really great time .
finally , they can rely on the four @-@ door äss@@ ler .
at the end , all students left a song of summer time and holiday time .
with the children , great joy broke out .
eight first @-@ class students have already registered for the new school year .
two Bulg@@ arians arrested for illegal camping in Greece
two Bulg@@ arians were det@@ ained for illegal camps in Greece , the Ministry of Foreign Affairs , quoted on television , announced .
on the morning of August 1 , a group of illegal people in Si@@ th@@ onia was arrested by the police , including the two Bulg@@ arians .
on the same day , they were released while a study is underway .
the Ministry of Foreign Affairs reported that the Bulg@@ arians were later released .
the Greek authorities have tigh@@ tened control over the free camp and put anyone who is found to stay in a place that is not intended for this purpose , fin@@ es substantial fin@@ es .
the controls are continued throughout the season .
the ministry said that the Court can impose a fine .
software update for diesel vehicles : what people now need to know
how exactly does the software update take place ?
do dies@@ els have to participate in the promotion ?
the most important questions and answers at a glance .
at the diesel summit , BMW , Daimler , Opel and Volkswagen Corporation have offered software updates for a total of around 5.@@ 3 million cars .
they aim to improve the emissions behaviour of cars from the emission categories euro 5 and sometimes Euro 6 .
Euro @-@ 4 @-@ diesel or worse are excluded .
An@@ ja S@@ met@@ anin of ACE Auto Club Europa gives assessments :
is the new action mandatory ?
no , the software updates dealt with are voluntary .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the mandatory updates are only valid for the vehicles that have Schum@@ an Software , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says An@@ ja S@@ met@@ anin . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Bundes@@ amt ( KBA ) has ordered their retro@@ fit .
how and when will customers be informed about updates ?
manufacturers have announced swift implementation over the coming months , but not yet known an exact date .
Daimler advised to write to each person affected .
if an inspection is due anyway , that will be done within the scope of the inspection .
how long will the retro@@ fitting take place altogether ?
&quot; hard to say , &quot; says S@@ met@@ anin .
this depends on the manufacturer &apos;s commitment and political pressure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because we have seen , the car manufacturers do not voluntarily trade in the topic of the environment so far . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
how long should the update last ?
the conversion itself could last only three to four hours in the workshop .
it could be time @-@ consuming to get an appointment .
what do drivers who do not drive a car from BMW , Daimler , Opel and the VW Group ?
the ACE advises to wait .
probably foreign manufacturers would reti@@ re , so S@@ met@@ anin .
now threat@@ ens a massive price decline of Euro @-@ 4 cars ?
the ACE fears this .
but even in the regions where b@@ ans thre@@ aten .
in rural areas , there are so far no loss of value for older diesel .
the ACE advises to wait for sales .
ll Cool J gets Kennedy Center Award
the Kennedy Awards Gala is one of Washington &apos;s gl@@ amor@@ ous events .
the first prize ceremony under President Tr@@ ump is promising to become political .
one of the winners doesn &apos;t want to come - from protest .
ll Cool J ( 49 ) is the first ra@@ pper to receive one of the cov@@ eted awards from the prestigious Kennedy Center .
as the cultural institution announced on Thursday , this year , singer Gl@@ oria Est@@ ef@@ an ( 59 ) , Li@@ onel Rich@@ ie ( 68 ) and the choreograph@@ er Carmen de Lav@@ all@@ ade ( 86 ) and the TV producer Norman Le@@ ar ( 95 ) are among the honored .
the awards are presented at the beginning of December .
traditionally , US President Donald Tr@@ ump will host a reception and attend the award together with his wife Mel@@ ania .
the award winner , Le@@ ar announced with progressive TV series , already announced to refrain from participating in the gala .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this Pres@@ i@@ dency has decided to negl@@ ect the arts and human rights - even the means to withdraw - and that burdens me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the 59 @-@ year @-@ old Est@@ ef@@ an stressed that she would use the talk with Tr@@ ump to clarify her views .
the Kennedy Center , named after former President John F. Kennedy , is the largest cultural institution in the U.S. capital .
the former winners include Mer@@ yl Stre@@ ep , Are@@ tha Fran@@ klin , Robert De Nir@@ o , George Lucas , Tom H@@ anks and St@@ ing .
we make the city life worth
Roland W@@ acker , Has@@ la@@ chs Stadt@@ bau@@ meister , will reti@@ re next year .
the place is already written out - but suitable candidates are rare .
W@@ acker Stadt@@ bau@@ meister has been a mayor since 31 years .
and the work still makes him great fun , as he medi@@ ates in the press conversation .
he reports of varied but also demanding tasks waiting for his successor .
at the same time , it is surprising that so far , no application will fill the requirements profile .
the city is looking for an architect or civil engineer at the earliest possible time .
thus , taking into account the regular notice of dis@@ miss@@ al , there should be enough time for a revision .
since Has@@ lach works for the Administr@@ ative Community as the Lower Building Law Authority , the applicant must show corresponding conclusions .
because this function wants to keep the city in any case .
if they couldn &apos;t fill them any more , the citizens would have to go to Off@@ enburg for advice .
but the clos@@ eness to the citizens is important to the city and to him , says W@@ acker , who reports of a good working atmosphere and a good atmosphere between the authorities and the citizens .
in more than 30 years in office , some important projects have accumulated , looking back at the W@@ acker with pride .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we make the city worth living , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is sure of the building office and his staff . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but also in the future , varied projects are on the agenda : the re@@ design of the former Hu@@ kl@@ a @-@ Are@@ as and the Nieder@@ ho@@ fen parking lot have been initiated .
the kin@@ ship bridge between Boll@@ enbach and Stein@@ ach is renewed and the stadium renovation is still a topic .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the latter alone will cost around 1.5 million euros , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if we do it right , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; W@@ acker estimates . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all in all , great tasks await my successor . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the work here is fun . &quot;
there is a lot of room for a city building master .
Has@@ la@@ chs &apos;s own farm yard and nursery can react quite flexibly to many .
&quot; you can move a lot , &quot; says W@@ acker , and the design of the green spaces is often praised by citizens and visitors .
as the old town as an ensemble is under monument protection , it is important to &quot; have an eye for what is in place &quot; when new buildings are approved , the reti@@ ring city building master emphasizes .
in any case , the mayor has a high level of responsibility .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is a builder , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the end everything is running here over my table . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
with care and coordination , he can count on many years of staff : Markus Neu@@ ma@@ ier ( construction ) has been here for ten years , Manfred Schön@@ er ( civil engineering ) has been working for 15 years .
also , that his successor remains long , W@@ acker wants : &quot; we are looking for someone who really wants to identify and stay with the spot . &quot;
continuity is not only important for a good company climate , but also for the further development of the city .
if you would like to be buried by Roland W@@ acker , after information from the city of Has@@ lach , you should have a completed degree of studies as a graduate engineer or a Bachelor &apos;s degree with the subject of architecture and have good knowledge in the fields of construction and planning law .
the Municipal Building Department is subject to civil and civil engineering , construction management planning , gr@@ under@@ ing matters , administration of urban properties , urban depot with building yard and municipal gardening centre , as well as the Lower Building Law Office , including monument protection .
bicycle on lines thrown : South track closed
according to the police , the previously unknown perpetr@@ ators had thrown the blue bicycle from the railway track crossing in the area of Le@@ ob@@ enen road ( B@@ 116 ) on the lines .
these were damaged so severely that the approaching freight train had to be hal@@ ted .
the investig@@ ators go out of two male perpetr@@ ators and have been looking for them for the night .
close to the scene , a pink sco@@ oter and a bicycle driver were observed by witnesses .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this goes far beyond a region of Lausanne , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ö@@ BB spokes@@ man Christoph Pos@@ ch about the AP@@ A . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the perpetr@@ ators would have je@@ op@@ ardi@@ zed themselves and endangered the train traffic .
in addition to the damage to the locomotive and the equipment as well as the delay of delay and the costs for rail transport , rail customers could also get to the perpetr@@ ators .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; overall , a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; significant &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sum says the speaker . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the damage was repaired on Friday afternoon , the rail traffic on the south railway line could be run without disabilities .
just under ten passenger trains were cancelled Friday morning , two of which concerned the correspondence .
freight trains did not fall , but they had a delay .
according to the Ö@@ BB spokes@@ man Christoph Pos@@ ch , around 200 metres of overhead lines had to be replaced .
insul@@ ators and ma@@ sts were also damaged .
red meat , dairy products and chocolate could help to allevi@@ ate IB@@ D ( inflammatory bow@@ el disease )
red meat and chocolate can sound like a night@@ mare for your digestive system .
but a new study says exactly the opposite : a diet rich in meat @-@ based proteins and dairy products could allevi@@ ate the symptoms of patients with inflammatory bow@@ el disease .
the incur@@ able condition affecting approximately 1.3 million and 300@@ ,000 in the United States causes stomach cra@@ mps and blo@@ ating , recur@@ rent or bloody diar@@ rho@@ ea , weight loss and extreme ti@@ redness .
while suffer@@ ers are usually advised to ste@@ er meat and dairy products to relieve their symptoms , researchers at the Washington University found that the essential amino acid tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han of proteins contributes to developing immune cells that promote a toler@@ ant gut .
the leading researcher , Dr. Marco Col@@ onna , explained that immune cells in the gut pat@@ rol in order to ensure that harmful micro@@ bes that hide in food are not penet@@ rating into the body .
cells capable of dis@@ solving inflammation are ev@@ ened by cells that promote tolerance and protect the body without damaging sensitive tissues .
if the balance is too far in the direction of inflammation , it can result in an inflammatory bow@@ el disease .
in experiments it was found that a kind of tolerance @-@ promoting immune cell occurs in mice that carry a certain bacter@@ ium in its intest@@ ines .
and the bacter@@ ium requires tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han - one of the building blocks of proteins - to cause the cell &apos;s appearance .
Professor Col@@ onna said : &quot; we have established a connection between a species of bacteria - Lac@@ to@@ bac@@ ill@@ us reu@@ ter@@ i - which is a normal part of the gut micro@@ bi@@ ome , and the development of a population of cells that promote tolerance .
the more tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han the mice had in their food , the more they had of these immune cells . &quot;
he suggested that the combination of L. reu@@ ter@@ i and a diet rich in tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han will promote a more toler@@ ant , less inflammatory intestinal disease if the same system also helps with people .
the post @-@ doctoral candidate Dr. Lu@@ isa Cer@@ v@@ antes @-@ Bar@@ ra@@ gan was investigating a kind of immune cell that promotes tolerance when she found out that a group of study mice had such cells , but a different group of the same trunk that was separated but not had .
they suspected that the difference with the intestinal micro@@ bes of the mice had to do - the community of bacteria , viruses and fung@@ i that normally live in the gastro@@ intestinal tract .
the intest@@ ines of the mice were sequ@@ enced DNA sequences and six bacterial species were found which were present in mice with the immune cells , but without missing them in mice .
mice were treated in a sterile environment , so that they lack@@ ed an intestinal micro@@ bi@@ ome and did not develop these kinds of immune cells , and they received the L. reu@@ ter@@ i and the immune cells .
in order to understand how the bacteria acted on the immune system , the researchers L. reu@@ ter@@ i grew in a liquid and then transferred small amounts of the liquid - without the bacteria - on un@@ ripe immune cells that were isolated from the mice .
the immune cells developed into the toler@@ ant cells .
when the active component was puri@@ fied from the liquid , it proved to be a by @-@ product of tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han metabolism , known as an i@@ dol @-@ 3 lac@@ tic acid .
if the researchers doubled the amount of tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han in mice &apos;s food , the number of cells increased by about 50 percent , but if the tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han was hal@@ ved , the number of cells decreased by half .
Dr. Cer@@ v@@ antes @-@ Bar@@ ra@@ gan declared that people have the same toler@@ ant cells as mice , and that most of us L. reu@@ ter@@ i protect in our gastro@@ intestinal trac@@ ts .
it is not known whether tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han @-@ by @-@ products from L. reu@@ ter@@ i develop the cells in humans as in mice , but defects in genes related to tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han were found in people with inflammatory bow@@ el disease .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The development of these cells is probably something we want to promote as these cells control inflammation on the inside surface of the intest@@ ine . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
potentially high tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han values can lead to an extension of this population in the presence of L. reu@@ ter@@ i . &quot;
Jose M@@ our@@ in@@ ho believes Manchester United has committed a &quot; genius &quot; with N@@ eman@@ ja M@@ atic
at Manchester United , N@@ eman@@ ja M@@ atic signed a &quot; genius , &quot; Jose M@@ our@@ in@@ ho writes after the mid@@ fiel@@ der had his debut against S@@ amp@@ d@@ oria on Wednesday evening .
the 40 million pound of signature of Chelsea started with a 2 : 1 victory in Dublin , the last pre @-@ season game before the UEF@@ A Super Cup against Real Madrid starts on Tuesday , and impressed in the holder role as people like Paul Pog@@ ba and Andreas Per@@ eira had mar@@ ched at will .
but matic was excluded from the pre @-@ prepar@@ atory Asia tour of the blues and managed only 45 minutes , which admitted M@@ our@@ in@@ ho that he had to improve before the beginning of the Premier League season .
&quot; he needs time , but his experience , intelligence , a genius in the way he thinks - he thinks soccer , &quot; M@@ our@@ in@@ ho said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will help him to be ready sooner than later . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
alongside M@@ atic , Victor Lind@@ el@@ of and Rom@@ el@@ u Lu@@ k@@ ak@@ u started in the Avi@@ va Stadium as M@@ our@@ in@@ ho formally started his start @-@ XI for the start of the season .
the Independent revealed that M@@ our@@ in@@ ho wanted three more new commitments , but he insi@@ sted that the club had already done a &quot; fantastic job &quot; to fulfil three of his four priority new commitments .
&quot; three out of four , for this I thank the association , &quot; he added .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I will be happ@@ ier if they get four of four for me , but they have taken great pains . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Boeing &quot; paints &quot; Dream@@ liner in the sky
the U.S. aircraft manufacturer Boeing has painted the sil@@ houette of a Dream@@ liner in the sky .
the pilots flew from Seattle to Washington state Washington , but the drawing started in Marqu@@ ette in US state Mich@@ ig@@ an and drew in the form of a Dream@@ liner over the USA , which are several thousand kilometers .
the action lasted 18 hours and a minute .
on the radar screens the form of a Dream@@ liner was to be .
the whole thing was a endurance test for new engines .
Boeing had previously made such advertising .
thus the number &quot; 7@@ 87 &quot; and the Boeing logo were painted in the sky .
new draft for Martin Schulz - Hanover , we have a problem
as the wind turns : when Sig@@ mar Gabriel was still SPD leader , Social @-@ Democratic Prime Ministers always looked to Berlin with a certain concern before elections .
only no distur@@ b@@ ance from the party centre , but no counter @-@ wind from the Con@@ federation - was the most important desire of the bal@@ lot fighters .
since Martin Schulz leads the party , it has fundamentally changed .
since then , employees from the Willy @-@ Brandt @-@ House have watched the events in the SPD @-@ governed state capitals with increasing terror .
what Mr Schulz has received from there since the beginning of the year would not have been described in the approach by head@@ wind .
there were deep set@@ backs .
and one by one .
after the surprising end of the red @-@ green majority in Lower Saxony , the CD@@ U sees a general signal against the coalition of the SPD and the Gre@@ ens .
&quot; this once more shows that red @-@ green can simply not go@@ vern reliably , &quot; said CD@@ U general secretary Peter Tau@@ ber to the editorial network Germany ( R@@ ND ) .
the surprise fac@@ tional exit of a Gre@@ ens de@@ pu@@ ties has pl@@ ung@@ ed the government of Prime Minister Stephan Wei@@ l ( SPD ) into a severe crisis .
five months before the Sunday election , his Red @-@ Green coalition lost its single @-@ votes majority to the opposition from CD@@ U and F@@ DP .
the Green @-@ Federal managing director Michael Kell@@ ner called on the back@@ sliding Lower Saxony &apos;s Green parliam@@ ent@@ arians El@@ ke T@@ westen to return their mandate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the transition to the CD@@ U means a clear distortion of the will &apos;s will . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; El@@ ke T@@ v@@ ests must immediately return her mandate , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Federal Executive Director and El@@ ector of the Gre@@ ens to the Deutschland ( R@@ ND ) editorial network . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this must not be true at all , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; an election @-@ party campaig@@ ner si@@ ghs when the new hi@@ ban message reaches the party centre on Friday morning . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Stephan Wei@@ l , the SPD Prime Minister of Lower Saxony , is at the CD@@ U without his own government majority after the transition from the Green parliam@@ ent@@ arians to the CD@@ U .
it is the preliminary climax of a whole series of large and small crises in the SPD national associations .
and nobody knows what &apos;s next .
the misery began with the un@@ expect@@ edly clear defeat at the Saarland election in March .
a blue eye , no longer , was comfor@@ ted by the comrades at that time .
after the legislative elections in Schleswig @-@ Holstein and North Rhine @-@ Westphalia , everything will be different .
it was then - and things became much worse .
the defeat in Kiel triggered the SPD , the Düsseldorf bankrupt@@ cy sli@@ pped the party smoothly .
lab@@ ori@@ ously , the comrades assembled in the weeks after@@ ward .
then , when they had just had new courage , the G @-@ 20 summit came from Hamburg .
and with him came the next low beat .
mayor Ola@@ f Sch@@ olz , the last strong SPD member of the SPD , lost his Nim@@ bus that weekend because he was sitting in the El@@ b@@ phil@@ harmon@@ ie while his city was burning .
and because he did wrong in the way of crisis communication , what can be done wrong .
since then , Sch@@ olz is fighting for his political survival .
so now also Stephan Wei@@ l .
because of the VW @-@ emissions aff@@ aires and its role in the Supervisory Board , the Prime Minister of Lower Saxony has been in criticism for quite some time .
mi@@ ese survey values were added .
despite this , or maybe just because , in the past weeks , Wei@@ l has always tried to establish accents in the Con@@ federation .
the effort of the former mayor of Hanover to expand his power in Berlin was not concealed either by comrades in the context of Martin Schulz .
they let him grant him , because they spoke of Wei@@ l a stabili@@ zation of the party .
now the exact opposite could occur .
because of this , Wei@@ l is not guilty at the party @-@ internal compul@@ sion of the Lower Saxony nature .
and Schulz at all .
for the time being comrades , comrades , try to keep their own ranks closed .
their anger is directed towards the Gre@@ ens , and here especially on the apo@@ state parliam@@ ent@@ arians T@@ v@@ ests .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is int@@ ol@@ erable and democratic , as Mrs. T@@ est puts her own career eating over the interests of all others , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Matthias Mi@@ er@@ sch , head of the party left in the SPD Par@@ liam@@ entary Group , the editorial network Germany ( R@@ ND ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mrs. T@@ westen is not elected by her person as a direct candidate , but has been elected by the national list of the Lower Saxony Gre@@ ens in parliament , according to the Lower Saxony deputy .
the logical consequence would be that she returns her mandate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Thomas Op@@ per@@ mann , head of the SPD Par@@ liam@@ entary Group , compl@@ ains &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; un@@ democratic manoeu@@ vre &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the vote four years ago was clear : the people have made Stephan Wei@@ l a prime minister , &quot; says Op@@ per@@ mann , who leads the Lower Saxony SPD as a leading candidate in the election of the Bundestag , the R@@ ND .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now the personal career of a future CD@@ U member distor@@ ts the election result , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Op@@ per@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he demanded clari@@ fication of the background .
I want to know if there has been more or there are further commitments from the CD@@ U Nieder@@ sachsen .
subsi@@ dy funds for center III
if you want to renov@@ ate your house in the years to come , you will soon be able to receive support from the country .
in addition , mayor Albert Sch@@ ind@@ ler and three representatives of St@@ eg Urban Development were informed on Wednesday .
at the beginning of the information session , Sch@@ ind@@ ler once again gave a review of what was happening .
since 1991 it has been given in sens@@ ations rehabilitation areas .
at that time , in the renovation area I between 1991 and 2004 , the state of Baden @-@ Württemberg assumed two thirds of the total amount of funding .
in the rehabilitation zone II from 2005 to 2016 , the subsi@@ dy was still 60 percent .
for Sch@@ ind@@ ler , the previous refur@@ bish@@ ments are a &quot; success project &quot; - it is finally important to encourage the development of the interior and not only to open up new building areas .
on April 4 , I received the information from the Government Pres@@ i@@ dency of Karlsruhe that there will be a san@@ itation zone III .
the total sum of the funding amounted to 8@@ 33 3@@ 33 Euro , of which 500 000 Euros came from the country , the rest of the municipality &apos;s feeling .
how is a san@@ itation zone originated ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one will , as Sch@@ ind@@ ler continue to investigate , where the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; really old &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; houses are . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but it also plays a role as to whether there is interest in the planned area at all .
if necessary , the area borders may then move again .
the bridge stood on Wednesday evening Martin Keller , Gab@@ y Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann and Sarah Got@@ zel .
the cellar presented the contents of the federal government programme &quot; Social City , &quot; in which the renov@@ ations would then be carried out .
the core of the program is the rev@@ ital@@ isation of inner cities , improving the living and working conditions and maintaining and expanding the infrastructure .
the measures would be carried out object @-@ related , that is per property .
the refurb@@ ishment area would then finally be defined as a statute .
the funding period for the funding has been running since 1 January 2017 until 30 April 20@@ 26 .
until September this year , however , the survey will only be carried out , within the framework of which the participants in the rehabilitation area receive a questionnaire for filling out .
in November or December , the association will take place as soon as possible , so that the renov@@ ations can begin next year .
afterwards , Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann explained that every Comm@@ une had to carry out the said preliminary investigations .
it is about evaluating the urban development issues and deciding when it is rehabil@@ itated and to what extent .
for the particular property there will be a re@@ mark in the land register .
Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann will come after sensitivity even once more and make a picture of the situation , she promised .
Got@@ zel emphas@@ ised that a key success factor for the project was the participation of the participants .
therefore , there will be questionn@@ aires , which will be sent to the citizens in the coming weeks and completed by the end of the summer holidays .
the yellow questionnaire is the &quot; building and property sheet , &quot; where it is possible , among other things , the structural condition and the reconstruction prospects .
in the grey questionnaire , the &quot; household and apartment arch , &quot; data on size , distribution and residents of a residential area can be made .
the blue &quot; bow &quot; can only be filled if business premises are operated in the building .
however , it should be noted that Got@@ zel pointed out that a completed questionnaire was not at the same time an application for funding .
furthermore , new construction measures are not eligible .
Sch@@ ind@@ ler still stressed that the distribution of funds in accordance with the &quot; gre@@ y@@ ho@@ und principle &quot; works - who comes first , grin@@ ds first .
you can &apos;t reserve funds for later .
finally , photos of the project &quot; Location II &quot; were shown to make the present a &quot; tasty &quot; renovation .
British invent@@ or himself uses a micro@@ chip to get in house and car with a hand movement
a British invent@@ or is the first in the country equipped with a micro@@ chip to open his door@@ step , enter his office and even start his car with a hand movement .
Steven Nor@@ th@@ am , 33 , had im@@ planted the tiny chip between thumb and index finger and now offers the service for companies and individuals who want to simplify their lives with technology through his company Bio@@ Te@@ q .
he has partner@@ ed with Dr. Ge@@ off Wat@@ son , a consult@@ ative an@@ aes@@ th@@ esi@@ ologist at the Royal H@@ amp@@ shire County Hospital in Win@@ chester , H@@ ants , to ensure that the implant procedure is performed according to medical standards .
the technology resembles a cat and dog impl@@ anting micro@@ chip and takes only 30 seconds .
the company of Mr. Nor@@ th@@ am also wants to change the locks on houses and cars in such a way that they are compatible with the chip , all for an extra cost of £ 300 per castle .
the married father of one now has installed both at home and at his BMW Z@@ 4 technology which begins when his hand is at the wheel .
white House advertising costs cost thousands of tax@@ pay@@ ers
the White House decision to fly a nav@@ y helicopter to the South La@@ wn for an event that raised American manufacturing in the last month costs tax@@ pay@@ ers according to the military &apos;s rel@@ inqu@@ ishment submitted to TI@@ ME Magazine , up to 24@@ ,000 US dollars .
the green @-@ white Si@@ kor@@ sky V@@ H @-@ 3D , known as Marine One , when the president is on board , was the heart of the event on July 17th in the White House with American construction programs .
President Donald Tr@@ ump , Vice President Mike P@@ ence and senior officials of the White House made a tour of products from all 50 countries .
the helicopter , manufactured in Connec@@ ti@@ cut , was issued in addition to a Ma@@ ine Yacht , a Wis@@ con@@ sin fire@@ man car and a Miss@@ issi@@ ppi fork @-@ lift truck .
the White House military bure@@ au demanded the presence of the helicopter in a frag@@ ment@@ ary order or Fra@@ go , barely 36 hours before the helicopter landed on the South La@@ wn , according to the records of the Navy Hel@@ icop@@ ter Squ@@ ad@@ ron One ( H@@ MX @-@ 1 ) , the unit responsible for the operation of the helicopter .
&quot; I just wanted you to be aware of it because it is such an unusual event with a high visibility , &quot; wrote the commander of the H@@ MX @-@ 1 on the eve of the event to his superi@@ ors , the deputy commander of the aviation .
the message indicated that the helicopter arrived on July 17th at 7 o &apos;clock in the morning on the South La@@ wn for the event at 3@@ pm , and so long remained until the lawn was cleared between 18 : 00 and 21 : 00 this evening .
the note adds that if the departure from the White House is delayed , a second crew would be required for the return flight due to the limitation of the service hours .
the original flight crew was during the event with the helicopter , while the security personnel of the unit remained on the ground during the time .
from the records provided by TI@@ ME , it was not clear whether a second flight crew was ultimately required .
the H@@ atch Act forbi@@ ds federal employees to use state property for political purposes .
data sets indicate that H@@ MX @-@ 1 has asked if the event could harm the destination .
&quot; a question we asked was whether it was a violation of the H@@ atch acts and we were informed that this was not the case , &quot; the commander wrote .
&quot; sounds like you &apos;re locked , &quot; answered the deputy commander .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Made in America &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; event was designated as an official event by the White House and was not covered by the H@@ atch Act . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but also official events have political over@@ tones .
at the event , the president gave an impetus for the reform of the health reform that was underway in the Senate and he propag@@ ated the efforts to cur@@ b governmental regulations .
the use of aircraft , known as Marine One or Air Force One , for politically advantageous purposes is hardly a new phenomenon .
pres@@ idents are obliged to use them for the trip .
but to demand its use only for a photo @-@ operation is unusual .
Tr@@ ump carried out an investigation in February when the presidential aer@@ op@@ lane made against the background of its first campaign r@@ all@@ ye in Melbourne , Florida , taxi services , and its Twitter account is full of news that compl@@ ained about the use of the presidential aer@@ op@@ lane by its predecessor .
&quot; the White House is delighted with the show &quot; Made In America &quot; - the products from all 50 states produced by American workers with American materials , &quot; said the deputy press secretary of the White House , Lind@@ say Wal@@ ters .
H@@ MX @-@ 1 crew often carry out training flights in the Washington and South La@@ wn area to deal with the US president in the White House with precise centimet@@ ers .
when Tr@@ ump was at the G@@ 20 Summit in Germany at the beginning of July , H@@ MX @-@ 1 carried out 58 exercise land@@ ings in the White House .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the flight for the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Made in America &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; event was the training requirement for the flight crew for the month , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a civil servant . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition , helicop@@ ters flew 11 hours on that day for non @-@ presidential support missions .
the White House said that tax pay@@ ers took over the burden for none of the other pro@@ ps presented at the event .
a spokes@@ man of Si@@ kor@@ sky said the company was not involved in setting up the helicopter on the South La@@ wn .
H@@ MX @-@ 1 does not maintain budget@@ ary records for the presidential flights , and it is difficult to determine the exact costs for the event .
according to the US Department of Defense for the fiscal year 2017 , the Do@@ D ref@@ unds rate for the V@@ H @-@ 3D is 24.@@ 380 USD per hour .
records of the unit recorded the flight time of the aircraft as 30 minutes from the home base of the Marine Corps Air Fac@@ ility in Quanti@@ co in Virginia .
the White House ar@@ gues that the actual cost of operation of the helicopter is far below this rate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the cost of tax@@ pay@@ ers based on estimates for reimbur@@ sement rates is highly mis@@ leading , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wal@@ ters said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these estimates include personnel , maintenance and many other hidden costs included in the annual funding . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to a RA@@ ND study from 2015 , ref@@ unds for Do@@ D do not include personnel costs , but also take into account the costs of fuel , maintenance and conclusion of the contract .
at that time , the former press officer of the White House , Se@@ an Sp@@ ic@@ er , defended the use of the helicopter for the event .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the idea is to present this week to things produced in America , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Sp@@ ic@@ er . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; and I know Si@@ kor@@ sky and Connec@@ ti@@ cut state are very proud that they contribute to our national security , and I assume that hundreds if not thousands of people are dependent on it .
and I think , like most Americans , we are all proud of the helicopter and other military equipment for which so many Americans have worked ti@@ rel@@ essly .
of course , it is appropriate to emphasize that . &quot;
it was not clear whether Tr@@ ump was inter@@ acting with the helicopter when he entered his tour of the South La@@ wn for the event , but he sat in the driver &apos;s seat of a fire engine .
in the White House Tr@@ ump spoke to representatives of Si@@ kor@@ sky and j@@ oked with the media about his own fleet of company products .
&quot; I know Si@@ kor@@ sky very well , &quot; said the president , &quot; I have three of them . &quot;
TC BW Ne@@ uss in front of tri@@ cky task
the leading runner of the second tennis league in Germany joins the S@@ V table in third place .
the TC blue @-@ white Ne@@ uss starts tomorrow at 11 o &apos;clock in Kiel at the table third Su@@ chs@@ dorfer S@@ V .
in spite of five games still flaw@@ less balance , the top runner of the Second Tennis Bundes@@ liga got the sense of reality .
team Princip@@ al Mari@@ us Z@@ ay has any respect for the opponent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a compact team that is always playing in quite similar formation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; just in the back positions I find the team very good . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in terms of class and stability at the S@@ V Su@@ chs@@ dorfer , imports from the high North are concerned .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; their Dan@@ es and Finn@@ s can even point to bets on the Davis Cup . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and they are also strong in doubles , &quot; Z@@ ay says with a view to Har@@ ri Heli@@ ov@@ a@@ ara ( Finland ) , Andr@@ e Gö@@ ran@@ sson ( Sweden ) , S@@ ören and Es@@ ben O@@ lesen , Martin Pe@@ der@@ sen and Andreas B@@ jer@@ k ( all Denmark ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is as always difficult for us . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you also need a good dose of luck . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Ne@@ us@@ ser crew for the trip to the north is practical .
his debut for blue @-@ white could give Maxim@@ e Jan@@ sen .
if the Fren@@ ch@@ man currently still active in the Chall@@ enger tournament in the Italian Bi@@ ella active Fren@@ ch@@ man is not part of the Bundes@@ liga , the Z@@ den@@ ek Kol@@ ar ( Czech Republic ) , playing at the tournament in the Czech Liber@@ ec , comes to his first use this season .
the previously un@@ defeated ch@@ illing Hans Pod@@ lip@@ nik @-@ Cas@@ tillo was at the ball at the AT@@ P tournament in K@@ itz@@ büh@@ el yesterday with the Bel@@ drei V@@ asi@@ lev@@ sky .
he was supposed to be at the same time as Bot@@ ic Van de Z@@ and@@ schul@@ p , N@@ iel@@ s Lo@@ ot@@ sm@@ a ( both Netherlands ) and the Belgian Juli@@ en C@@ agn@@ ina .
after his two victories last Sunday against the club at the Al@@ ster , Má@@ té Val@@ u@@ z could once again move to the team .
if it is enough for the 18 @-@ year @-@ old Hungary who was the number one of the Junior World Ran@@ king in January 2016 , one does not fill up with Mari@@ us Z@@ ay &apos;s trainer at Mari@@ us Z@@ ay .
how America can harm the O@@ MV
Donald Tr@@ ump was not really happy when he signed his signature on Wednesday evening under the law to tigh@@ ten sanctions against Russia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in his ha@@ ste to en@@ act the law , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Congress has packed a few &quot; un@@ constitutional provisions &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the reaction from Moscow was as sharp as expected , and even Brussels fo@@ amed the U.S. advance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after all , the design envis@@ ages pun@@ ishing European companies that help the Russians to build gas pi@@ pelines in the EU . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
since then , investors from domestic O@@ MV who co @-@ financed the construction of the Russian Baltic Sea Region North Stream 2 together with other European companies are concerned .
the Dro@@ h@@ kul@@ isse is huge .
however , it is too early for an estim@@ ation of the consequences , such as the official statement of the oil company .
in fact , Donald Tr@@ ump would have to raise the sanctions even by an Executive Order .
twelve weapons are available to him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the press &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has seen which the group could withstand and which they could really hurt . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Nar@@ cos Staff@@ el 3 Tra@@ iler : without Pablo Es@@ co@@ bar , the Cal@@ i Cart@@ el is put in the center of the hit series by Net@@ fli@@ x
despite the second season of Nar@@ cos , the Pablo Es@@ co@@ bar kill@@ ers , the Net@@ fli@@ x series is not over for a long time .
the seasons three and four were already confirmed by the streaming service , the first one received their first trailer and showed the latest vil@@ s of the show .
with the third season , the DE@@ A has focused its attention on the rich@@ est organisation of drug traffi@@ cking in the world : the Cal@@ i Kart@@ ell .
led by four powerful god@@ parents , they operate like a Fort@@ une 500 company with more government bri@@ bes and violent actions .
Gil@@ berto Rodri@@ gu@@ ez Ore@@ ju@@ ela ( Dam@@ ian Al@@ c@@ azar ) is the leader of the cart@@ el , Miguel Rodri@@ gu@@ ez Ore@@ ju@@ ela ( Francisco Denis ) is their head , P@@ ach@@ o Herr@@ era ( Alberto Am@@ mann ) commands the Mexican connection , and Ch@@ ep@@ e Sant@@ ac@@ ru@@ z London@@ o ( Pep@@ e Rap@@ az@@ ote ) is located in New York .
in the newly released trailer , Pedro Pascal returns to J@@ avier Pe@@ ña , the guy who invites American and Colom@@ bian law enforcement agencies to support the war against drugs .
other new actors are M@@ ati@@ as Var@@ ela , Michael Stahl @-@ David , Matt W@@ hel@@ an , Miguel Angel Silv@@ est@@ re , Kerry al and Ar@@ tur@@ o Castro .
the third season of Nar@@ cos will begin on September 1st .
role in reverse : the city provides 46 kitchen aids
the city re @-@ organ@@ ises the K@@ ita lunch table itself .
with fixed contact persons for the children and an assignment to the team .
in the municipal kinder@@ gar@@ tens the clock is turned back .
on 1 September the city of Kre@@ feld takes over the food supply in the municipal kinder@@ gar@@ tens ( Kit@@ as ) again in self @-@ control .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for Son@@ ja Pom@@ mer@@ anz , deputy head of the youth welfare department , this is a good news : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we all were very pleased . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
cook continues except house : a cat@@ erer under@@ takes this task and provides fresh boiled chill@@ ed .
the town runs 46 kinder@@ gar@@ tens in the Kre@@ feld area , and in 44 children get a hot meal at lunch@@ time .
in the past Kit@@ a@@ year 28@@ 00 children were sitting at the tables , and the demand is growing steadily .
&quot; in the meantime not only children who are taken care of 45 days of the week are eating at the K@@ ita lunch , &quot; explains Pom@@ mer@@ anz .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the offer is also valid for 35 @-@ hour care when children stay until 2 : 00 pm . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
46 part @-@ time employees will have kitchen service starting September 1 : they heat the supplied food , supplement them with salad , raw vegetables and fruit , portions the meal individually , give away food , clear away , rinse and clean the kitchen .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the employees are assigned to a K@@ ita , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Pom@@ mer@@ anz . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the size - there are two group@@ ed as well as seven @-@ section facilities - decides on the ho@@ ur@@ ly circum@@ ference .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the kitchen hel@@ pers are now firmly members of the K@@ ita team , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Pom@@ mer@@ anz . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so they are much more involved and it is easier for the hospital to implement educational concepts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
because it is also about healthy eating and cooking classes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the children are meant to help prepare food . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the direct connection of the kitchen power to the team is reasonable .
also for the children .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they have a well @-@ known force in the K@@ ita , a person familiar to them , and not constantly changing people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this continuity is important for the children .
the cleansing of the K@@ ita @-@ rooms - until now also the task of the kitchen staff - is done by special cleaning personnel in the future .
this variation - the separation of cleaning and kitchen service - has , in addition to the quality improvement of the kitchen performance , also the charm that it issued in the cost comparison between self @-@ control and foreign lending for the city as the most economical one , it is called the Press Office .
and that , although 46 part @-@ time forces are read@@ just@@ ed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but these hours are not so heavily in weight for around 750 people in education , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Son@@ ja Pom@@ mer@@ anz . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Afgh@@ an democracy depends on the political role of women , says the UN
elections can only be representative if all members of society , including women , play a role , said the head of the UN mission in Afghanistan on Wednesday .
Nicholas Hay@@ om , head of the United Nations mission , said that hundreds of women are candidates for elections in the provinces . three women candidates for the role of vice @-@ president and more than 30 percent of newly registered voters are women .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the role of women cannot be over@@ estimated , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said on Wednesday in a statement . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
elections can only be truly prestigious and credi@@ ble if women participate fully and involved in all parts of the election process .
Afgh@@ an elections for the provincial council and the presidential elections will take place on April 5 .
the Tali@@ ban have published threats against a election process that coinci@@ de with the transition from international combat actions to an advisory role .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this year elections for the first time will hand over power peac@@ efully from a democr@@ atically elected government . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hay@@ om said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a strong role for women will reinforce the democratic success of Afghanistan . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Afgh@@ an independent El@@ ection Commission reported that 1.2 million women of total registered 3.@@ 6 million voters were registered .

men attempt to exter@@ min@@ ate 13 @-@ year old girl
two young men aged 19 and 23 have tried on Thursday to ro@@ b a 13 @-@ year @-@ old girl .
according to the police , the men spoke about the 13 @-@ year @-@ old , who kept up with friends at Kol@@ p@@ ing@@ straße at 2 : 55 , because they wanted to phone the girl &apos;s mobile phone .
the 13 @-@ year @-@ old refused the request and continued with her friends .
as a result , one of the perpetr@@ ators tried to attack the mobile phone and the necklace of the girl , which , however , failed .
without loo@@ t the duo fled .
the two young men could later be arrested by the police .
the investigations are underway .
G@@ MB concern about investments in the Mc@@ Vi@@ tie factory in Glas@@ gow
a union wants to secure the long @-@ term commitment to production at its plant in Glas@@ gow at managers of the bis@@ cuit manufacturer Mc@@ Vi@@ tie .
G@@ MB Scotland said that the company has kept silent about the future of investments at the T@@ oll@@ cross location .
more than 500 employees work in the plant , which produces hob@@ no@@ bs and R@@ ich Tea bis@@ cuits in addition to other products .
Mc@@ Vi@@ ties owner Pla@@ dis said he invested more than 5 million pounds in recent years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he added that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; employees and trade union representatives &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; would be first experienced &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if their activities would change . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in a letter to the branch manager of the company , G@@ MB Scotland Mc@@ Vi@@ tie &apos;s call for &quot; concerns to say that financing for the modernis@@ ation of production lines will not be pushed forward . &quot;
G@@ MB @-@ Senior @-@ organis@@ er Dre@@ w Du@@ ffy , said : &quot; the fact that we cannot gain clarity about business needs and investment plans for future of T@@ oll@@ cross is deeply affected by our members .
generations of families have worked here and the workers concentrate heavily on the local community and the Glas@@ gow area , an important pillar for decent employment in an area with high unemployment and social disadvantage .
therefore , under the perspective of jobs , wages and prosperity , and against the backdrop of Bre@@ x@@ it , the increasing cost of living and the chronic decline of production , the eastern end of Glas@@ gow is desper@@ ately pressing a flour@@ ishing production presence at Mc@@ Vi@@ tie . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a spokes@@ woman of Pla@@ dis said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the branch manager at T@@ oll@@ cross has only yesterday received a letter from G@@ MB Scotland , and the company will react immediately because we value our continued commitment to employees and trade union representatives . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
two months ago we had a regular meeting with employees and G@@ MB representatives at T@@ oll@@ cross , where some questions were discussed openly .
we discussed with the employees that , like all companies operating in an extremely competitive and uncertain economic climate , we constantly check our business - and this applies to all our business areas and locations - to remain competitive .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in recent years we have invested more than 5 million pounds in our T@@ oll@@ cross facility , especially in production lines and operational improvements . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we recognise the legacy of T@@ oll@@ cross as a place of production fully and entirely . if our operations are changing at the location , the employees and their union representatives will be the first to experience this . &quot;
did the PS@@ G Barcelona warn against N@@ ey@@ mar three years ago ?
the side of La League may regret their interest in Marco Ver@@ r@@ atti
Paris Saint @-@ Ger@@ main will not indul@@ ge in its persecution of N@@ ey@@ mar , after giving an offer of £ 18@@ 9 million to trigger its release clause , but have they warned Barcelona three years before the world record rush ?
the sensational base has heated the transfer window in the summer , because the League 1 club is ready to break the world record by more than double the previous mark , whereby Paul Pog@@ ba returned to Manchester United in the past season for 89 million pounds .
after finishing , N@@ ey@@ mar becomes the most expensive player in the world and the highest paid professional ath@@ lete in the world . PS@@ G offers wages of more than 500@@ ,000 GBP per week .
Barcelona is fur@@ ious about the way N@@ ey@@ mar has forced his way out , although a source near the Catalan board insi@@ sts that the club has always given its best to take care of him since his arrival from San@@ tos in 2013 .
but was the football world warned of the PS@@ G president three years ago from this prospect ?
when Manchester City was interested in the signing of Bla@@ ise Mat@@ u@@ id@@ i , N@@ asser Al @-@ K@@ hel@@ ai@@ fi had a strict warning for every club that wanted to sign one of the best players of PS@@ G .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am not worried because they know that when they touch one of our players , we will be in opposition to them , we will contact their players , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Al @-@ K@@ hel@@ ai@@ fi . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; we respect all clubs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but if they try to sign one of our players , this will have consequences . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Barcelona seems to have crossed this line , with the Spanish association put an interest in the PS@@ G mid@@ fiel@@ der Marco Ver@@ r@@ atti at the beginning of this summer .
PS@@ G made it clear that they would not allow the International from Italy to travel under any circumstances , and Barcelona could feel the consequences of this interest by losing one of their price offers for N@@ ey@@ mar .
sco@@ oter tos@@ sed and damaged
in the night of Friday on Saturday , an unknown do@@ er deliberately revers@@ ed a sco@@ oter in the Königs@@ feld street in front of the property number 30 and thus attacked property damage of more than 200 euros in the fair@@ ing of the vehicle .
the police Sch@@ ram@@ berg , telephone 07@@ 4@@ 22 / 27 01 @-@ 0 , requests for clu@@ es .
the police are looking for witnesses to an accident at the B 215 between Stol@@ zen@@ au and Le@@ ese .
because a car came to meet him in his lane , the driver had to do@@ dge a VW Tour@@ an and tou@@ red the crash barrier .
on Thursday evening , the 34 @-@ year @-@ old from Reh@@ burg @-@ Lo@@ cc@@ um took his VW at 7.@@ 55 a.m. on the B 215 from Stol@@ zen@@ au in the direction of Le@@ ese .
in the area surrounding Stol@@ zen@@ au , a car came to meet him on his lane so that he had to turn right .
the Tour@@ an driver tou@@ red the crash barrier .
property damage was created on the passenger car .
the driver of the passenger car , a Mercedes Benz , had over@@ taken a truck and continued his journey without taking care of the traffic accident .
according to the accident damaged , it can be good that the cycl@@ ist did not notice the accident at all .
the police now request witnesses of the incident and the driver of the pol@@ lu@@ ter to contact Stol@@ zen@@ au on tel . 05@@ 7@@ 61 / 9@@ 20@@ 60 .
interview : &quot; Dom@@ sp@@ atzen @-@ report reli@@ eves Pope brother Georg R@@ atz@@ inger &quot;
the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen @-@ Report on the ab@@ uses is reli@@ eved by Pope brother Georg R@@ atz@@ inger .
that means author and historian Michael Hes@@ emann .
the final report on the abuse sc@@ andal at the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen provides further discussions .
Christian Wei@@ sn@@ der , spokesperson for the reform movement &quot; We are Church , &quot; declared publishing to the German press agency , as expected by the former Regensburg bishop and today &apos;s Cardinal Gerhard Ludwig Müller , as well as by the Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , the 93 @-@ year @-@ old brother of the Pope Bene@@ dict XVI , an ap@@ ology .
it would serve the pres@@ tige of the Catholic Church very much if Müller and R@@ atz@@ inger would express their deep regret upon their own om@@ is@@ sions or their false evaluation of the processes at that time .
the Vatican newspaper &quot; Os@@ serv@@ at@@ ore Rom@@ ano , &quot; on the other hand , critic@@ ised the fact that reporting on violence was measured with &quot; double standards . &quot;
with regard to the gri@@ ps in Regensburg , nobody doubts that it is &quot; sham@@ eful and sham@@ eful acts &quot; that would have to be punished and prevented in the future ; however , the &quot; degree of media manipulation , &quot; the author Luc@@ etta Scar@@ aff@@ ia , historian and member of the national Italian Bio@@ ethics committee .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the habit of calling the Catholic Church as a source of all evil is already part of everyday experience and prepares the public opinion to keep it normal , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; writes Scar@@ aff@@ ia . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Princess Gl@@ oria of Th@@ urn und Ta@@ xis also spoke with the Bavarian Radio in an interview : &quot; you love to go to the church and this is a dev@@ our@@ ing dev@@ our . &quot;
she also pointed out that &quot; pun@@ ches had been a normal educational means &quot; in her youth , &quot; to be done with che@@ ek@@ y children , as I was one . &quot;
they found it unfair to apply today &apos;s standards for earlier decades , as the world has changed .
in connection with reports on mis@@ use cases , Pope brother Georg R@@ atz@@ inger often appeared .
completely wrong , author and historian Michael Hes@@ emann , who wrote with R@@ atz@@ inger the memory band &quot; My brother of the Pope &quot; ( translated into 12 languages ) .
&quot; I have to take care of Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , &quot; says Hes@@ emann , &quot; because all this had nothing to do with him , &quot; he evalu@@ ates the results of the final report .
what exactly is in the 440 @-@ page report that the lawyer Ulrich Weber put forward with the En@@ ligh@@ tenment by the B@@ ist@@ um Regensburg institution with the En@@ ligh@@ tenment ?
a total of 5@@ 47 Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen were sexually ab@@ used between 1945 and the beginning of the 1990s &quot; with high plau@@ sibility &quot; victims of attacks , 67 dom@@ ine@@ ties sexually ab@@ used .
in the final report , Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , who worked in Regensburg from 1964 to 1994 , says : &quot; in summary , it can be said that by Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister R. in many cases forms of physical and psychological violence have been applied .
especially with high emotion@@ ality , the punishment for the students was also more violent .
in contrast to many other defend@@ ants , however , many victims estimated the general humanity of R. and , in numerous cases , even combine positive memories with it in numerous cases . &quot;
in the interview , Hes@@ emann explains why the final report on the mis@@ use sc@@ andal in the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen Georg R@@ atz@@ inger reli@@ eved his mind .
Mr. H@@ ün@@ emann , the 440 @-@ page report on the &quot; In@@ ci@@ dents of Viol@@ ence of Viol@@ ence on Prot@@ ective F@@ oods at the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen , &quot; is a contradictory picture of Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger .
on the one hand many students emphasize his &quot; humanity . &quot;
on the other hand he also appears as a ch@@ ol@@ eric and perfec@@ tion@@ ist , who became more tangible when a cathedral @-@ record didn &apos;t bring top performance musi@@ cally .
how do you evaluate this final report as a bi@@ ograph@@ er ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : if you take the trouble and read the entire 440 pages long report from the front to the back , you have to ask yourself why the name Georg R@@ atz@@ inger is in it at all .
he is just eight pages dedicated to him and he is clearly acqu@@ itted of any suspicion of complic@@ ity or complic@@ ity in the terrible cases of sexual abuse .
the exc@@ esses of violence in the pre @-@ school also took place outside his sphere of action .
it is possible to reproach it at best , of which too late or first indications haven &apos;t taken seriously enough .
the gymn@@ asi@@ um gymn@@ asi@@ um on which he worked was felt by practically all those questioned - literally &quot; redemption , &quot; &quot; heaven &quot; and &quot; better world . &quot;
the vast majority of his students , Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , also presents an excellent testimony , describing him as &quot; warm @-@ hear@@ ted , &quot; &quot; sincere , &quot; &quot; sincere , &quot; &quot; competent , &quot; and &quot; understanding , &quot; as extremely good @-@ nat@@ ured teachers who regularly supplied the boys with cakes , bis@@ cuits and cand@@ y and &quot; always surrounded by grapes of children . &quot;
only a minority compl@@ ains about its perfec@@ tion@@ ism and its high emotion@@ ality , which led to rage erup@@ tions .
that he did not only kne@@ ad with chairs and threw the key@@ ring on the floor , but also distributed ear@@ then and too che@@ ek@@ y guys at the hair or ears , he has admitted years ago , deeply regre@@ t@@ ted and ap@@ ologi@@ zed for it .
it must be said , however , that such educational methods were widespread in the fra@@ grant period , the 1960s and 1970s , in both parents and teachers .
do you know such breeding methods ?
of course , I think every one of us who was born before 1968 .
I also experienced this in a secular school , a state grammar school .
compared to what is actually happening in this report , namely the horrible sexual abuse and the exc@@ esses of violence at the pres@@ ch@@ ool , these are indeed bag@@ at@@ elles .
one wonders if it is not related to his fame and his role as a brother of Bene@@ dict XVI , that many media have just rush@@ ed to him .
many who never understood him are still working di@@ lig@@ ently on the Bavarian pop@@ e .
but the truth is : the report reli@@ eves Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in every way !
in the media , in connection with the report , a lot was reported on the subject of abuse at the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen .
is Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in the final report also placed any involvement or co @-@ wis@@ e@@ ship with regard to sexual abuse ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : clearly no .
not one of the 67 victims of sexual assault is claiming to have been entrusted to the Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister .
not even the parents were dedicated .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have never dar@@ ed to talk to my father or mother , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said one of those concerned , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; It was very embarrass@@ ing to me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the real problem with the enlightenment of sexual abuse was , however , that most victims are silent .
if they did not even entr@@ ust themselves to parents and si@@ bl@@ ings , then certainly not a choir leader , who would have been a colleague of the perpetr@@ ators in a certain way professionally .
how do the students R@@ atz@@ inger rate the role of R@@ atz@@ inger &apos;s role in the event of abuse ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : a question@@ able disciple articul@@ ated it so : &quot; regarding sexual abuse ... I see ... no case in which he ( Georg R@@ atz@@ inger ) had timely knowledge and could have stopped the perpetr@@ ator .
I hold it ... also for really absurd to assume that it is imp@@ uted to him ... boys more intru@@ sive or clearer or more likely to have opened than opposite their parents , dormit@@ ory managers , trust teachers etc .
that you talk to him about sex ... un@@ think@@ able . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so the report concludes : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that the students and / or their environment involved in the run @-@ up could not be confirmed as part of the investigation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
as for sexual abuse , Georg R@@ atz@@ inger is thus acqu@@ itted of any complic@@ ity .
he cannot be accused of preventing him from being prevented or brought to an ad .
therefore there is no reason to link his good name with these vile crimes , as happened in some cases .
in the media there was much of &quot; exc@@ esses &quot; in the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the report &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; looking away &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the former dom@@ ed master Georg R@@ atz@@ inger is accused of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; om@@ itting &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
does he have to live with this reproach ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : that &apos;s the big problem in reporting everything mixed and mixed up to a huge p@@ ine@@ al of sexual abuse and violent exc@@ esses and somewhere in the middle of Georg R@@ atz@@ inger .
but exactly that is again an abuse of the report .
it is separated clean@@ ly : between the pres@@ ch@@ ool and the gymn@@ asi@@ um of the cathedral @-@ cats , between sexual abuse and violence @-@ exc@@ esses as well as , we say once , other alleg@@ ations .
in addition , the report deals with incidents from the period since 1945 , thus also from four decades , in which Georg R@@ atz@@ inger was not a choir director of the cathedral @-@ cats .
the whole horrible test pedago@@ gy , the cases in which boys from sa@@ di@@ stic teachers were literally har@@ assed and mal@@ adjusted , and were terri@@ bly terri@@ fied , all took place at the pre @-@ school in Et@@ ter@@ z@@ hausen and P@@ iel@@ en@@ ho@@ fen , where really sc@@ andal@@ ous conditions have had to be ruled out .
but with them Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger had nothing to do , because he only had to face the boys when they were already on the cathedral sk@@ ew gymn@@ asi@@ um .
on the one hand , as most of the witnesses pointed out , the topic of &quot; pres@@ ch@@ ool &quot; was t@@ abo@@ o .
one was only happy to be able to escape and enjoyed the so much better treatment and for many even &quot; par@@ adi@@ si@@ ac &quot; states .
what was different from the gymn@@ asi@@ um gymn@@ asi@@ um ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : there was discipline , but no sa@@ di@@ stic violence .
and this is also true for Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , when the report concludes that &quot; many victims appreciate the general humanity of R. and , in many cases , even combine positive memories with it in numerous cases . &quot;
thus , at most , the accus@@ ation remains to have looked away .
however , in spite of all efforts , the report could only define two periods in which he was reported from the states at the pres@@ ch@@ ool .
the first time in 1970 / 71 , when he began to establish himself and from the events at a school where he was not working and was responsible ( so the witness ) didn &apos;t want to hear anything , and then only back in 1993 .
did Georg R@@ atz@@ inger consistently lose ears in front of the states ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : no , because in 1989 he wrote a letter to the director of the dome gymn@@ asi@@ um , which even reproduced the report .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in this he points out that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that in the pre @-@ school , the punishment is still practi@@ sed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he recommended urgent intervention in the face of the danger of negative press releases .
this was , of course , at a time when legal clarity had long been banned as criminal pun@@ ishments in Bavaria too .
before that , they were in a legal grey area , as each one of us know yet knows .
it was also difficult for him to assess where the persons concerned might be exagger@@ ated or dramati@@ zed , and where really the permissible limit had been exceeded .
but you can &apos;t say that he &apos;d always looked away .
this is simply not true .
it was only in 1980 that the capital punishment of schools was officially abol@@ ished in Bavaria .
Princess Gl@@ oria of Th@@ urn und Ta@@ xis claimed that it was unfair to apply today &apos;s pedago@@ gical standards to that time .
how do you see it ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : we histori@@ ans talk about the &quot; pit@@ fall of an@@ ach@@ ron@@ ism , &quot; that is , the danger to evaluate the past according to today &apos;s moral standards .
the princess was right .
but this of course does not apply to sexual abuse , which was abom@@ in@@ able at all times , and not for what has been banned in the pre @-@ school of ad@@ versity and violence against innocent children &apos;s souls , that goes far beyond that at the time .
this is all very horrible and I am glad that it is finally being worked out .
but at the same time I have to put Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in protection , because all that had nothing to do with him .
his means of discipl@@ ining and punishment , i.e. , sla@@ v@@ elling and pulling on the hair and ears , were widespread in the 1970s .
when physical punishment was then forbidden , he also strictly adher@@ ed to it .
what picture of his Regensburg time has Georg R@@ atz@@ inger back in conversations with you for the book &quot; My brother of the Pope ? &quot;
was the subject of test penalty also included in the language ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : well , in the book it &apos;s about the life of his brother Joseph , so Pope Bene@@ dict XVI , tells from his perspective , that the Dom@@ sp@@ atzen only played a side role .
nevertheless , I by no means spar@@ ed that he had a stric@@ ter regi@@ ment there .
but even this must be said once : without this perfec@@ tion@@ ism , without the demand of unconditional discipline , it would hardly have been possible for him to form an institution of Wel@@ d@@ rank , the true cultural ambassador of Europe and his musical tradition , which went on tour twice in the USA ( 1983 and 1987 ) and Japan ( 1988 and 1991 ) .
with bis@@ cuits and cand@@ y alone , the un@@ ru@@ ly boys are no longer a big singer and stand in front of every success , regardless of what area , but always discipline , passion and self @-@ overcoming .
what kind of people do you have experienced Georg R@@ atz@@ inger during the conversations with her book ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : through the work on the book and beyond , I really got to know Georg R@@ atz@@ inger and experience again and again as wonderful , humor@@ ous , basic @-@ good , deep @-@ believing and heart @-@ good people , of which one cannot imagine that he could even hurt a fly .
I regularly get in touch with how many former dom@@ ine@@ ties still keep contact with him 23 years after his retirement , visit him , visit him - he is almost blind - and treat him like a member of her family .
those who have not forgiven him until today are clearly in the minority .
today , most of the cathedral @-@ cats are grateful to him that he en@@ riches their lives and has taught them the world of music .
and that he is always a good , father@@ ly teacher - a strict father , certainly , that may be - but also a lovely respect@@ ful person , to which they still look up and glori@@ fy them today .
and please , again quite clearly : all you submit to him are educational methods that were on the agenda at that time .
we can be glad that we have long overcome this time .
but it is most un@@ just , a man just because he is prominent and has a more prominent brother to go to the medi@@ al sc@@ ap@@ ego@@ at .
there is only too obvious the evil intent that is behind it .
for the report that has just been published reli@@ eves him .
now the state would command a 93 @-@ year @-@ old man who acquired great mer@@ its and without the outside of Bavaria and perhaps Germany probably nobody would know the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen , finally to leave in peace .
