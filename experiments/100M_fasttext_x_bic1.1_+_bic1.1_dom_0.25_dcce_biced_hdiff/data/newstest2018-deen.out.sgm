<seg id="1">Munich 1856: four maps that change your view of the city</seg>
<seg id="2">An Irren prison, where young people meet today.</seg>
<seg id="3">A mine chapel, where now is dug for the underground tunnel.</seg>
<seg id="4">Farmers cultivate the former cause of farmers.</seg>
<seg id="5">The oldest official card coin promotes exciting stories to days.</seg>
<seg id="6">It is annoying when maps are not up-to-date.</seg>
<seg id="7">Everyone who had to get excited about it, because the car Navi showed a green meadow instead of a bypass road.</seg>
<seg id="8">The historical maps of the digital Bayern Atlases, an offer of the Bavarian State Government, are anything but up-to-date - but it is very informative.</seg>
<seg id="9">Especially if you compare them with current online cards.</seg>
<seg id="10">Then it becomes clear how cities and municipalities have changed in the spread-area of the Munich Mercury since the 19th century.</seg>
<seg id="11">The digital Bayern-Atlas is a FlickenteppI, which one recognizes as such.</seg>
<seg id="12">The large overview map has been incorporated into more detailed maps for cities and municipalities, so-called copyrights.</seg>
<seg id="13">These originated according to the Bayerisches surveying administration between 1810 and 1864 and originate from the first survey Bavaria.</seg>
<seg id="14">Your client: Napoleon.</seg>
<seg id="15">The French military leader occupied Bavaria since the spring of 1800 during the Second Coalition War with Austria.</seg>
<seg id="16">Napoleon wanted an overview of the occupied land and ordered Bayerns topographical survey - of course for military purposes.</seg>
<seg id="17">Even if the French troops finally departed with the peace of Lunéville of February 9, 1801, today's neighbors who created the idea of a nationwide Bavaria map.</seg>
<seg id="18">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "Elector Max IV pushed forward the project, founded the" Topographic Bureau "" "" "" "" - and thus the Bavarian surveying management. "" "" "" "</seg>
<seg id="19">The manuscript for Munich dates from the year 1856 and can be found on the website of the Bayerische Landesbibliothek.</seg>
<seg id="20">The comparison Early / Today is the most impressive example of the state capital.</seg>
<seg id="21">The city has expanded in all directions and has grown together.</seg>
<seg id="22">An example of this is Untersendling, which appears relatively isolated in the map of 1856.</seg>
<seg id="23">Sendling was founded 21 years after the development of the map, i.e. in 1877, as the Munich suburb.</seg>
<seg id="24">Today, Untersendling is located in the middle of the city.</seg>
<seg id="25">The houses of Untersendlings are concentrated around 1856 along today's Plinganserstraße, which was named after Georg Sebastian Plinganser in 1878, a leader of the uprising of the Bavarian peasants against Austria in 1705.</seg>
<seg id="26">Where today the Westpark is, one sees nothing as fields - at first glance: when zooming in, a smaller map with dozens of lines and numbers appears: handwritten numbered flutes from the so-called "primitive collection" from which the basic tax was derived.</seg>
<seg id="27">Small plots are no longer evidence of farmers there, but rather small gardeners of the "land in sun."</seg>
<seg id="28">A large green area is north of Untersendling.</seg>
<seg id="29">The Theresienwiese, since 1810 the scene of the October festival, was actually a meadow in the 19th century - and no concrete desert.</seg>
<seg id="30">On the other side of Isar, the historical map provides an insight into the history of psychiatric medicine.</seg>
<seg id="31">"" "" "" "in the document" "" "" "" "on the air" "" "" "" "but also in large letters" "" "" "" "Irren Anstalt" "" "" "" "in the area of today's district Au-Haidhausen." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="32">Yes, here at Auerfeldstraße one once locked people with delusions.</seg>
<seg id="33">In 1858 / 59 the Munich district Irrenanstalt "On the Auer Lüftments" was created.</seg>
<seg id="34">From 1872, Dr. Bernhard von Gudden managed the establishment of this psychiatrist, which is associated with the death of King Ludwig II.</seg>
<seg id="35">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "he was progressive for his time and ended, for example, the accusation of the so-called" "" "" "" "Irren." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="36">In addition, he prohibited the personnel to resort to violence against the occupants, "says Hermann Wilhelm, director of the Haidhausen Museum, who was engaged in an exhibition with the institution.</seg>
<seg id="37">For 280 patients there was first place; later it was extended to 500 places.</seg>
<seg id="38">At some point this capacity was no longer sufficient - the reason for the construction of the gynaecological facility in Haarlem in 1905.</seg>
<seg id="39">Since 2006, the Isar Amper Klinikum Munich-Ost, one of Germany's largest psychiatrists, has been located there.</seg>
<seg id="40">Young people in the Munich-based Salesianum meet at the premises of the former Auer Institute.</seg>
<seg id="41">The Order acquired the building complex in 1920 and transformed him into a youth home with training facilities.</seg>
<seg id="42">West is the football pitch of the TSV München Ost, east of residential buildings from the 1980s.</seg>
<seg id="43">In 2015, the children's house "Casa Don Bosco" was built in an architectural style reminiscent of the original building of the Irrenanstalt, which was destroyed during the Second World War in bombings.</seg>
<seg id="44">The Marienplatz was listed as "main plaza" in 1856, the Kaufinger street called "Kaufinger Gasse."</seg>
<seg id="45">The Second World War also brought a decisive change in the heart of Munich.</seg>
<seg id="46">In December 1944 the Allies bombed many holes in the city centre.</seg>
<seg id="47">A big one remained until today - at the Marienhof.</seg>
<seg id="48">The English Institute, small business houses and a chapel from the Middle Ages once stood at the Marienhof, where these days were preparatory work and on 5 April 2017 the ground-breaking ceremony took place for the second S-Bahn regular route.</seg>
<seg id="49">With the slider, the old Munich map can be compared with today's aerial view - and fill the hole at the Marienhof.</seg>
<seg id="50">Civil Rights Group publishes travel warning for Missouri</seg>
<seg id="51">The National Association for Promoting Fares has issued a warning for coloured people who travel to Missouri due to discriminatory policies and racist attacks.</seg>
<seg id="52">"the NAACP Travel Advisory for the state of Missouri, scheduled to enter into force by August 28, 2017, calls for African travelers, visitors and Missourians to pay special attention while travelling through the state, as a number of questionable, racial-based incidents occur in the entire state and be noted here," is stated in the Group's opinion.</seg>
<seg id="53">A recently adopted bill of Missouri, which makes it harder for people to win discriminatory lamentation, as well as the law enforcement agencies of the state, which disproportionately aimed at minorities, encouraged the group to issue the warning, said the NAACP.</seg>
<seg id="54">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "they have violations of civil rights that happen to people." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="55">They are stopped because of their skin colour, they are beaten or killed, "said the President of the Missouri NAACP, Rod Chapel, the Kansas City Star.</seg>
<seg id="56">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "we hear complaints in such a frequency that we have not yet heard." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="57">It is the first such warning issued by the Organization for a State in the United States.</seg>
<seg id="58">The group cited events such as racist offences against black students at the University of Missouri and the death of Tory Sanders, 28, a black man from Tennessee.</seg>
<seg id="59">Sanders died under questionable circumstances at the beginning of the year after he had no petrol during the trip and was taken into custody by the Missouri police without being accused of a crime.</seg>
<seg id="60">The Council also points out a recent report from the Missouri Office of the Missouri Office, which shows that black drivers in the state are 75 percent more common than whites.</seg>
<seg id="61">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "the recommendation is that people are aware and inform their families, friends and staff about what could happen in Missouri," "" "" "" "said Chapel." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="62">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "people must be willing to bring chewing money or let their relatives know that they travel through the state." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="63">Missouri recorded 100 hate crimes in 2015, according to the latest figures from the Hassan Crimes Report program of the FBI, which classify the state in relation to the number of such violations to the 16th rank of the country.</seg>
<seg id="64">The warning is also an answer to a new Missouri law that would make it more difficult to sue a company because of housing or employment discrimination.</seg>
<seg id="65">Prior to that, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) issued travel warnings for Texas and Arizona, after the states adopted immigration laws that commit local law enforcement agencies to arrest people because of immigration violations, which will contribute to the further reform of the ACLU.</seg>
<seg id="66">Warnings are usually issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for other countries, but lately, interest groups have used the measure as a response to certain laws and trends within the United States.</seg>
<seg id="67">The Delaunching Project is elementary</seg>
<seg id="68">The Fischerbacher Weimar project is a successful project and will be continued next year.</seg>
<seg id="69">The CDU Parliamentary Members Peter White and Kordula Kovac have provided a picture on the spot.</seg>
<seg id="70">Representatives of the fishing village of CDU together with Mayor Thomas Schneider and the two deputies met at the cemetery of the Schwendemann family.</seg>
<seg id="71">Markus Schwendemann granted first insight into his farm, in which he farms 55 hectares of lawns and 40 hectares of forest, 40 milk cows and as well as many kittens provided and accommodated in five apartments Feriengaeste.</seg>
<seg id="72">"" "" "" "the" "" "" "" "Black Forest" "" "" "" "is for him the alternative marketing path for the milk of his cows," "" "" "" "Schwendemann." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="73">Only regionales come to the table of the Feriengaeste.</seg>
<seg id="74">Since he is also BLHV president of Fisherbach he described the consecration project as "essential."</seg>
<seg id="75">I cannot manage to profit on such steep faces.</seg>
<seg id="76">The grassland area care for a lot of work, a lot must be handled with the brushcutter.</seg>
<seg id="77">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "we have to fight with the conditions and topography," "" "" "" "said Schwendemann." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="78">In 2003 he took over the parental business and engaged it without chemical plant protection and fertiliser even if it does not lead to bio-operation.</seg>
<seg id="79">"" "" "" "for Mayor Thomas Schneider there was clear:" "" "" "" "the Commune has recognized the importance of the" "" "" "" "mindset project" "" "" "". "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="80">Farmers would have to be supported at a cost of 3000 to 4000 euros per hectare.</seg>
<seg id="81">I hope that the afforestation of the land could be dragged out for quite a while.</seg>
<seg id="82">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "the biggest treasure we have is the people who work in agriculture and are thinking about how to continue their operation," "" "" "" "stressed the mayor." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="83">The farmers are often in the criticism because of the promotion</seg>
<seg id="84">In 2013, a total of 25 plots were fenced by eleven participants.</seg>
<seg id="85">The open area is thus 40 hectares, which are not to be affixed to at least 2023.</seg>
<seg id="86">Of the total cost of EUR 71 million, half was promoted by leader, a quarter carried the municipality of Fisherbach.</seg>
<seg id="87">Thus the farmers remained 12 610 euros, which they had to invest in 16.2 kilometers of pasture fence.</seg>
<seg id="88">"the big advantage is the longevity of the fences," explained Schwendemann.</seg>
<seg id="89">"" "" "" "Kordula Kovac stressed:" "" "" "" "you do a really good job, without farmers and farm women it doesn't work." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="90">"" "" "" "also for Peter white stood firm:" "" "" "" "here, the best food is produced." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="91">The Landscape District Directive (LPR) Baden-Württemberg grants the state support of wildest fences.</seg>
<seg id="92">The aim is to maintain the Black Forest.</seg>
<seg id="93">The condition is the presence of a conveyor belt specified by the LPR.</seg>
<seg id="94">In addition, the enclosed area must not be tractor-free (slope inclination above 35 percent) and must therefore be threatened by afforestation.</seg>
<seg id="95">For the Fisherbach Weidezren Project 2018, the application of eight participants with 24 parcels, which would like to build almost 16 kilometres of fence, is currently underway.</seg>
<seg id="96">The exhibition area corresponds to 35 hectares, the calculated costs are more than 112 000 euros.</seg>
<seg id="97">Is nothing sacred anymore?</seg>
<seg id="98">Now the White House of Trump is taking up the Statue of Liberty</seg>
<seg id="99">The most secure sign of a regime change is when they begin to attack the statues.</seg>
<seg id="100">The Americans appreciate these as well as any other - hence the carefully orchestrated downfall of Saddam Hussein at the Firs square in Baghdad in 2003.</seg>
<seg id="101">Stephen Miller, one of the key ideologists of the Trump-regime, certainly knew what he did when he took a symbolic axe in a heated argument with Jim Acosta of CNN about the President's proposals to drastically restrict the legal migration to the Statue of Liberty.</seg>
<seg id="102">In order to remain fair, Miller did not attack the statue itself.</seg>
<seg id="103">A horde of boat owners and Liberty-imitators would have landed him if he had done it.</seg>
<seg id="104">But it took its importance, and in particular the meaning that it was attributed to as the famous poem by Emma Lazarus in 1903, 17 years after the completion of the monument, his base was added.</seg>
<seg id="105">When Miller Acosta wrote: "I don't want to enter a complete thing about history here, but the Statue of Liberty is... a symbol of American freedom that illuminates the world.</seg>
<seg id="106">The poem you refer to, which was added later and is not part of the original Statue of Liberty. "</seg>
<seg id="107">Miller is factually correct, but as he formulated it himself, it is not really about history.</seg>
<seg id="108">It is about the contemporary response to the touching words of Lazarus, the only ones in which a state does not only invite any old immigrants, but the poorest of the poor: "your weary, your poor, / your oppressed masses who yearn to breathe freely, and the miserable waste of your rich coasts."</seg>
<seg id="109">There was never a time when the "eleventh trash" on our screens was better to see.</seg>
<seg id="110">Miller did not engage in literary criticism - he made it clear that those people in Trumps USA are not welcome.</seg>
<seg id="111">This conflict because of the significance of a statue is part of a broader political and cultural confrontation: it is in fact a conflict about the importance of America.</seg>
<seg id="112">Lazarus - and her friends who used to place their words on the basis of their death - knew very well that they performed a highly political action.</seg>
<seg id="113">The sculpture was intended to show the connections between French and American Republicanism by portraying the female embodiment of freedom in a classical figurative portrayal.</seg>
<seg id="114">Lazarus has changed this meaning: in her poem the female figure is no longer abstract - she has received a voice.</seg>
<seg id="115">And she gives herself a very different name: mother of the Exile.</seg>
<seg id="116">The connection of the poem with the image is a brilliant feminist coup and a devastating attack on American Nativism.</seg>
<seg id="117">And just how Lazarus changed the meaning of the statue, the people of the right wing wanted to change this for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="118">The great writer of Rush Limbaugh, a sort of John the Baptist for the coming of Trump, argued in 2010 that the Statue of Liberty would not invite anyone but rather an early Neoconservatives bringing the American flame to the surrounding world: "Lady Liberty is progressing.</seg>
<seg id="119">It is to carry the torch of freedom from the United States into the rest of the world.</seg>
<seg id="120">"" "" "" "the torch is not to illuminate the way to the United States." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="121">Limbaugh came across quite unusual here.</seg>
<seg id="122">The significance of the statue is entirely a question of the standpoint of perception.</seg>
<seg id="123">The great imaginative deed of Lazarus was to see her as she was seen by the exhausted, wretched but hopeful people after long and often horrible journeys on the decks of ships.</seg>
<seg id="124">It is in the truest sense to see the world from the perspective of people seeking refuge and a chance to improve their lives.</seg>
<seg id="125">Their statue speaks to them the words of hope and welcome they must hear.</seg>
<seg id="126">And this of course is not the perspective that Miller and Trump ever want to acknowledge.</seg>
<seg id="127">Their torch is not to illuminate the way, but ignite the hatred that is their only source of power.</seg>

<seg id="139">Several of the Scottish athletes are medals candidates, including Laura Muir and Andrew Butchart - who will compete against Sir Mon Farah on the 5,000 m track while Eilidh Doyle was chosen by the team as team captain.</seg>

<seg id="144">The Commonwealth Silver Medal winner, who will compete in the 400 m hurdles at its fifth world championships, says that it is "incredible" that 16 Scots are in the British team.</seg>
<seg id="145">Scotland's best overall number of athletes in the world championship was seven, which were achieved in 1983 and 2015.</seg>
<seg id="146">The middle-distance runner Muir leads this way and last year has set up five British and two European records.</seg>

<seg id="150">The team captain says that she is "hugely proud" of the fact that many of her compatriots are not only part of the team, but in some cases also join the medals and the finals.</seg>
<seg id="151">"the special thing about being team captain is that it was chosen by the other members of the team so that it was a great honor anyway, but knowing that my teammmates voted for me and chose me makes it something very special for me," she added.</seg>

<seg id="156">Yes, I think she went well.</seg>
<seg id="157">I have only pointed out that we are very happy in this situation as we have a home world championship.</seg>

<seg id="160">Block critics on Facebook: don't apply for a public office if you can't tolerate the heating of voters.</seg>
<seg id="161">The father of our country knew something of bad press.</seg>
<seg id="162">The Americans loved George Washington, but it did not take long before the papers struck him because of everything, from home affairs to his political principles.</seg>
<seg id="163">He inoculated with criticism, certainly.</seg>
<seg id="164">But he did not silence his critics.</seg>
<seg id="165">"" "" "" "for in the year 1783 Washington said:" "" "" "" "freedom of speech can be taken away - and, stupid and mute we are led like sheep to slaughter." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="166">This brings me to Maryland to Governor Larry Hogan who has to work to be more like Washington.</seg>
<seg id="167">Hogans's employees have blocked and deleted the contributions of at least 450 people who have expressed their views on their official Facebook page.</seg>
<seg id="168">And the American Civil Liberties Union complained him at the beginning of this week.</seg>
<seg id="169">The governor's staff dismissed the complaint as frivolous, and the online commentary was full of a counter-reaction with "Na, and?."</seg>
<seg id="170">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "it's just Facebook," "" "" "" "said many people." "" "</seg>
<seg id="171">But it is important.</seg>
<seg id="172">And it is particularly important when it is a type like Hogan.</seg>
<seg id="173">This is a republican governor in an overwhelming democratic state that is amazingly popular.</seg>
<seg id="174">He has the second highest agreement of the nation's fifty governors.</seg>
<seg id="175">Hogan is not a reactionary heat-head.</seg>
<seg id="176">He has shown a firm hand in the leadership of his state and strict observance of the principles.</seg>
<seg id="177">He was also very skillful to use Facebook as the primary means to connect with his voters and play his hair-less head after chemotherapy on his side.</seg>
<seg id="178">Therefore, the blocking of persons who come to the governor's side - which is a public forum, which is considered to be official and paid by employees who are paid with public tax dollars - is unnecessary and ultimately dangerous.</seg>
<seg id="179">In an interview with The Washington Post, Hogan's spokesperson Amelia Chasse defended the governor's actions and argued that the blocking of comments was nothing more than a moderation.</seg>
<seg id="180">But it is too easy to use the image of trolls or spammers or hateful people who swing the whip online.</seg>
<seg id="181">The mail addressed with some of the real people who were blocked by Hogan.</seg>
<seg id="182">And these are only real people who talk to their elected leaders: a teacher, an entrepreneur and a priest, not trolls.</seg>
<seg id="183">They all said their comments were respectful, thoughtful and not profound.</seg>
<seg id="184">The pastor quoted the Bible in his mail and appealed to Hogan's Catholic faith.</seg>
<seg id="185">Attorney Lakshmi Sarma Ramani von Bowie, Md., was not hateful, but she asked for hate crimes.</seg>
<seg id="186">"I said politely that I was disappointed that there was no reaction to hate crimes and other current news," she wrote in the comments section of the message "The Post."</seg>
<seg id="187">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "I do not appreciate this idea when a number of people take a position on the same subject, then they are ignored by some rather than a so-called collective effort and not recognized as a large group of affected citizens." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="189">The Facebook era makes it easy to cut a message by blocking a critic or dropping a negative comment.</seg>
<seg id="190">It is much cleaner than in earlier times, if you had done the same thing that employees were sent to collect and burn newspapers with critical articles or to arrest and silence demonstrators.</seg>
<seg id="191">But this is exactly what happens digitally.</seg>

<seg id="197">This should not be so difficult.</seg>
<seg id="198">At the time of Washington, the time of affordable portos had a similar effect as the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="199">The number of newspapers multiplied between 1776 and 1800, and anonymous writing recorders hit his lead.</seg>

<seg id="232">Over the past two decades, fewer and fewer people have died because of passive smoking in lung cancer.</seg>
<seg id="233">Scientists from the University Hospital Hamburg-Eppendorf (UKE) come to this conclusion in a study.</seg>
<seg id="234">"according to our estimates, 167 lung cancer cases are due to passive smoking per year," said Dr. Heiko Becher.</seg>
<seg id="235">As a comparison, he drew up his own study on this subject of 1994.</seg>

<seg id="248">If Bardina Degei cooks dinner, she does not use a stove.</seg>
<seg id="249">It even rarely uses a pot.</seg>
<seg id="250">In her wooden house in Enarotali, the capital of the Paniai Regina in the Unquiet Indonesian province of Papua, the housewife usually puts a sweet potato - locally called "nota" - directly into the fireplace.</seg>
<seg id="251">After half an hour the charred tuber is taken out with zealous, unwashed hands and swallowed.</seg>
<seg id="252">Degei is sitting on the clay ground - she has no furniture - where she also performs her daily work, e.g. to wash clothes with soft water from the nearby swamp.</seg>
<seg id="253">A bucket in a homeless room serves as a latrine.</seg>
<seg id="254">As the youngest of the four wives of her husband, no fields were assigned to her.</seg>
<seg id="255">Polygamy is common here.</seg>
<seg id="256">Of course, late to work can be dangerous: most of the village men are unemployed, and many drink heavily, and there are the soldiers here.</seg>
<seg id="257">"nobody dares to run around in the village after 17 o'clock," she says.</seg>
<seg id="258">It is a rare insight into the daily life in the highlands of Papua, a former Dutch colony, which was recorded in 1969 following a controversial referendum in Indonesia, when only 1,026 elders were to vote in front of the occupying troops.</seg>
<seg id="259">An existing movement, which stirred up the independence of the Dutch government, quickly turned against the government of Jakarta, which maintains the control of the region and excludes foreign journalists or legal monitors.</seg>
<seg id="260">In 2003, the province was officially divided into Papua and Western Papua, with the independent part of Papua New Guinea that included the eastern part of the island.</seg>
<seg id="261">Enarotali is as secluded as it is. the journey includes a 90-minute flight from the provincial capital Jayapura to Nabire and then a morning 5-hour drive with the car rental.</seg>
<seg id="262">There is no public transport.</seg>
<seg id="263">The city with about 19,000 inhabitants is made up of wooden houses, which are surrounded by bamboo fences, and made of corrugated iron roofs, which were converted by rust into different yellowish tones.</seg>
<seg id="264">Only very few Indonesians have made their trip here, let alone journalists and practically no foreigner.</seg>
<seg id="265">Before Christian missionaries arrived, Mee Pago Papuans worshipped a god called Uga Tamee.</seg>

<seg id="269">Papua is Indonesia's poorest province where 28% of people live under the poverty line and have some of the worst child mortality and literacy rates in Asia.</seg>
<seg id="270">But it is also Indonesia's Goldland.</seg>
<seg id="271">The largest and most profitable gold mine in the world, Grass Mountain, owned by the Freeport McMoran from Phoenix, is located only 60 miles from Paniai, a province province in the size of New Jersey with 153,000 inhabitants.</seg>
<seg id="272">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "in 2015 alone, Freeport has mined $3.1 billion in gold and copper." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="273">In addition, Papua has wooden resources valued at an estimated $78 billion.</seg>
<seg id="274">These riches, however, are a source of misery for the Papua, which ensure that Indonesia's powerful military keeps a stifling presence.</seg>
<seg id="275">An investigation of 2005 in the New York Times reported that Freeport paid nearly 20 million US dollars between 1998 and 2004, including up to $150,000 in a single officer.</seg>
<seg id="276">Papuan demands for greater autonomy threaten those golden goose and are treated mercilessly.</seg>
<seg id="277">According to information from activists, more than 500,000 Papua have been killed and thousands have been raped, tortured and imprisoned by the Indonesian military since 1969.</seg>
<seg id="278">Massecies in Papua's tribal highland in the 1970 "s have been declared genocide in accordance with the Asia human rights commission.</seg>

<seg id="281">"it is difficult to count the number of victims since every week incidents happen," says Andreas Harsono, Indonesia researcher for Human Rights Watch.</seg>

<seg id="288">The Indonesian President, Joko Widodo, popularly known as Jokowi, promised to address inequalities and violations of law in Papua during his campaign in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="289">The former carpenter secured 27 of the 29 districts of Papua, including Paniai, on the way to the presidential palace in Jakarta.</seg>
<seg id="290">But in Papua little has changed, and today the locals feel betrayed.</seg>
<seg id="291">"our hearts are broken because we voted for Jokowi in 2014, with the expectation that he will fulfill our hopes that justice will be restored," You say.</seg>
<seg id="292">In fact, Paniai broke down only two months after Jokowis's inauguration in October.</seg>
<seg id="293">On December 7, 2014, a group of 11 children was outside and sang Christmas carols in front of a camp fire in Enarotali when two Indonesian soldiers broke out on a motorcycle through the darkness.</seg>
<seg id="294">The frightened children told them that they should turn off their headlights.</seg>
<seg id="295">One of the soldiers took an attack on her tone and later returned with four soldiers, the local pastor Yavedt Tebai.</seg>
<seg id="296">The soldiers, who had drank, chased and struck the group with their gun-pistons, said victims and witnesses.</seg>
<seg id="297">Then one of the soldiers fired into the group of children.</seg>
<seg id="298">One child, the 16-year-old Yulianus Yeimo, was so severely beaten that he fell into the coma.</seg>
<seg id="299">A few hours later, the building of the nearby government commission was set on fire and things escalated the next day.</seg>
<seg id="300">About 1,000 young Papua men, women and children gathered on a football ground in front of the local police station and the Military Command Center to demand justice.</seg>
<seg id="301">They carried ceremonial hunting arches and carried the Waita-Dance - in the circle continuously and iitising a bird song - from Papua Mee Pago-tribe.</seg>
<seg id="302">Some demonstrators started throwing stones on police and military posts.</seg>
<seg id="303">When the mood was heated, the soldiers sent a command over an internal radio: "if the masses are resisting more than three times, they shoot them dead," is said in an official document of TIME, which was not released to the local media.</seg>
<seg id="304">Yeremias Kayame, 56, head of the Kego Koto district of Enarotali, saw the threatening danger and called for peace and called for the crowd to return home.</seg>
<seg id="305">No one was able to listen in the mood.</seg>
<seg id="306">"when I turned around, I was suddenly shot in my left wrist," he said TIME on the verandah of his colorful painted wooden house.</seg>

<seg id="311">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "I saw that he was dead... I kissed him." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="312">The chief inspector of the Papua police, Yotje Mende, told reporters that his officers wanted to "secure" their station because they were attacked.</seg>
<seg id="313">"we must defend ourselves if people threaten to kill us," said the spokesman of the Papua police, Commissioner Pudjo Sulziyo, in 2015.</seg>
<seg id="314">"it's about life and death."</seg>
<seg id="315">According to Human Rights Watch, five young demonstrators were killed and many others wounded.</seg>
<seg id="316">The news about the killings was only filtered on the following day after Jakarta.</seg>
<seg id="317">For three weeks, Jokovi in Jayapura held a passionate speech in which he expressed sympathy for the families of the victims and swore to address the historical abnormalities in Papua.</seg>
<seg id="318">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "I want this case to be resolved immediately, so it will no longer happen in the future," "" "" "" "he said." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="326">Wiranto, whom the UN charged with crimes against humanity, demanding more than 1,000 victims of death in East Timor in 1999, said that 11 cases of violations of human rights in Papua were already included, including the Paniai incident.</seg>
<seg id="327">Families of the Paniai victims responded violently to such claims.</seg>
<seg id="328">"I was interviewed four times over the last three years, but there was no progress," says Yohanes.</seg>

<seg id="338">During a confrontation between villagers and the manager of a construction company who refused to bring a unconscious man to hospital, one person and 17 others were injured, including children.</seg>
<seg id="339">The man, the 24-year-old Ravianus Douw, who was drowned when he was fishing in a nearby river, died on the way to the hospital.</seg>
<seg id="340">Excited villagers protested in front of the company's site office.</seg>
<seg id="341">The police said that the villagers threw stones on officers who responded by firing warnings.</seg>
<seg id="342">But natives say that the mobile Brigade (Indonesian paramilitary police) began shooting at the crowd and killed one.</seg>

<seg id="346">Paniai was always an unrest for the Indonesian government.</seg>
<seg id="347">The lack of meaningful development strengthens the dissatisfaction of the family members Mee, Moni, Dani and damal, who live in the green highlands of Papua.</seg>
<seg id="348">Many joined the Free Papua Movement (OPM), the rebel army claiming to defend the rights of the Papua by infecting sporadic attacks and kidnappings of Indonesian soldiers.</seg>
<seg id="349">Some of the top OPM guides are from Paniai, including Tadius Yogi and Daniel Yudas Kogoya.</seg>
<seg id="350">In response to this, in recent years thousands of people in Paniai have been arrested and arbitrarily taken into custody under the pretext of "safeguarding national sovereignty."</seg>
<seg id="351">Some never stop again.</seg>
<seg id="352">Among the people in Papua, Paniai is known as "a tragic, forgotten place."</seg>
<seg id="353">Poverty increases dissatisfaction.</seg>
<seg id="354">The little rice sold in Enarotali is too expensive for locals.</seg>
<seg id="355">Bread is just beyond reach.</seg>
<seg id="356">People here are building up everything they eat: especially nota and fruit and leafy vegetables.</seg>
<seg id="357">Agriculture is the task of women to process four or five fields of sweet potato.</seg>
<seg id="358">They keep most of the harvest for the family while the rest is sold on the local market.</seg>
<seg id="359">Ten pieces of Nota cost only 10,000 Indonesian rupees (75 cents).</seg>
<seg id="360">In the course of time, economic inequalities between the native Papua and the new migrants have grown, which have arrived in greater numbers since the opening of new flight routes to the airport of Nabire.</seg>
<seg id="361">The few jobs that exist in the region generally address the better educated and affluent migrants.</seg>
<seg id="362">Papua rarely have capital or the necessary skills to make their own companies competitive.</seg>

<seg id="365">Beyond that, restrictions in the reporting of international media remain tense.</seg>
<seg id="366">At the beginning of the year French journalists Franck Escudie and Basille Longchamp were deported for lack of coordination with related institutions from Papua, although they were given the rare permission to film.</seg>
<seg id="367">According to Phelim Kine, the Deputy Asia Director of Human Rights Watch, the promises of Jokowis's election campaign to raise restrictions on reporting to promote transparency and development were not realized.</seg>
<seg id="368">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "there are new dangers for foreign journalists trying to report from Indonesia's unrest eastern provinces of Papua and Westpapua: visa refusal and a black list," "" "" "" "he said in an explanation." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="370">In March, six Pacific states - Tonga, Nauru, Palau, Tuvalu, the Marshall Islands and the Solomon Islands - called on the UN Human Rights Council to investigate the "different and widespread injuries" in Papua, including the Paniai firing.</seg>
<seg id="371">The same countries have historically seen the OPM.</seg>
<seg id="372">The spokesman of the Indonesian Ministry of Foreign Affairs Arrmanatha Nasir rejected the allegations of the group and said journalists in Jakarta: "in Indonesia there is still a democratic system, and there are free media, so it is difficult to cover the evidence of human rights violations."</seg>
<seg id="373">Local people want more foreign governments to take note of this.</seg>
<seg id="374">When an official delegation from the Netherlands attended, under the direction of the Human Rights Ambassador Kees Van Baar, Jayapura on 4 May, locals broke their silence and urged him "We want freedom," according to a source that also participated in the meeting, but remain anonymous.</seg>
<seg id="375">Indonesia has another presidential election in 2019, but the Papua should say that they will probably not vote for Jokowi again.</seg>
<seg id="376">"Jokowi is a man who has good intentions, but he is surrounded by the people involved in the Paniai shots," says Gobai, Chairman of the Board of Directors.</seg>
<seg id="377">He wants Jokowi to know that the Paniai people, except that it lives under the constant threat of a predatory military, is located in poor educational and health services.</seg>

<seg id="407">A survey among passengers showed that more than 20 percent were smuggled deliberately or unconsciously prohibited items at the control points of the US Transportation Security Administration, including at least 6 percent who entered the aircraft while they accidentally wore forbidden knives or other items with blades.</seg>
<seg id="408">Less than 1 per cent claimed they had been late discovered that they had gone astray with firearms, ammunition or explosives.</seg>
<seg id="409">The survey was conducted among more than 1,000 people - provided by a Jet Charter service, the Stratos Jet Charters Inc., also noted that younger travellers were more likely to ignore the rules.</seg>
<seg id="410">From those surveyed who admitted that they knowingly tried to fly with something forbidden by TSA, 19.7 per cent of millennials were compared with less than 15 percent who were members of Generation X.</seg>
<seg id="411">The most common items that were deliberately rushed by TSA agents were food and liquids.</seg>
<seg id="412">More than 3 percent admitted having knowingly carried articles with blades by security control, while 2.2 percent of the female respondents and 3.7 percent of the male respondents also confirmed that they had intentionally brought forbidden drugs to the plane.</seg>
<seg id="413">The company said it had asked travelers throughout the country to find out how many advertently smuggled goods from airport security and how many would have done it intentionally.</seg>
<seg id="414">It is no surprise that the people who are most likely to wear jewelry - knowingly or unknowingly - wear the safety, those who are most frequently flying.</seg>
<seg id="415">The company, however, points out that the TSA guidelines are a bit complicated and confusing.</seg>
<seg id="416">People are often unsure which liquids they may take with or how much of it.</seg>
<seg id="417">It is therefore no surprise that the largest amount of liquids seized by TSA are forbidden fluids.</seg>

<seg id="423">In addition to the ever triumphant figures on sales increases and even more gigantic sales targets, Tesla Chef Elon Musk has revealed a different, less brilliant figure for the first time at the announcement of the latest quarterly balance: the cancellation of the new mass market model 3.</seg>
<seg id="424">Over the past few months, Musk frequently had over 500,000 pre-orders for the new car, whose extradition has just begun.</seg>
<seg id="425">Now Musk admits: 63,000 have already been withdrawn from the total 518,000 pre-orders.</seg>

<seg id="428">At present 45,000 such non-binding reservations suggest that Musk cleared up in a telephone conference with analysts.</seg>
<seg id="429">However, the Tesla boss does not believe that the cancellation of about 12 percent of all orders could become a problem.</seg>

<seg id="431">Last year, Tesla delivered 84,000 vehicles.</seg>
<seg id="432">In 2018, all models will be put together - 500,000 will be one million by 2020.</seg>
<seg id="433">The demand for this is obvious.</seg>
<seg id="434">According to Musk, 1800 reservations are made per day.</seg>
<seg id="435">Anyone who orders a Model 3 today may expect delivery at the earliest in the second half of 2018 - if Tesla manages to drive his brand new production lines tested in practice without any major interruptions with maximum capacity utilization.</seg>
<seg id="436">Many experts doubt that this is possible.</seg>
<seg id="437">If it comes to major delays, then the non-binding of reservations may become a problem for Tesla.</seg>
<seg id="438">Because then the company cannot prevent dissatisfied customers from running away in droves.</seg>
<seg id="439">EPA chief Pruitt rushes back to reduce emissions because of the Obama-Era rules</seg>
<seg id="440">A day after he was accused of 15 states, Scott Pruitt, head of the Environmental Protection Agency, withdrew his previous decision to delay the implementation of the Obama era rules in order to reduce the emissions caused by smog causing air pollutants.</seg>
<seg id="441">Pruitt presented the changes when his agency turned out to be more responsive to the needs of state environmental authorities than previous administrations.</seg>
<seg id="442">He did not mention the lawsuit raised against his previous position in a Federal Court of Appeal.</seg>
<seg id="443">It is about a deadline expiring on 1 October for countries to comply with the standards of 2015 for down-to-earth ozone.</seg>
<seg id="444">Pruitt announced in June that it would delay its compliance with one year to give its authority more time to study the plan and to avoid "interfering with local decisions or hampering economic growth."</seg>
<seg id="445">Pruitt, who was prosecutor of Oklahoma before his appointment, was a long time a reliable opponent of strict environmental protection regulations.</seg>
<seg id="446">Since its arrival in Washington, Pruitt has repeatedly gone over to block or delay regulations that resist the chemical industry and the industry of fossil fuels.</seg>
<seg id="447">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "the sudden reversal of Wednesday is the latest legal setback for the Prudentials regulatory roll back agenda." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="448">Last month, a Federal Court of Appeal in Washington decided that the EPA administrator exceeded his authority when he tried to delay the implementation of a rule of the Obama administration, the oil and gas companies to monitor and reduce the methane leakage.</seg>
<seg id="449">In a statement released on Wednesday evening, Pruitt suggested that his reversal at ozone standards quite simply reinforces the willingness of the EPA to cooperate with the states through the complex process of timely fulfillment of the new standards.</seg>
<seg id="450">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "in previous administrations, the EPA has often not adhered to deadlines for implementing and then waiting to be accused of activists and others, and in an agreement the deadline for carrying out," "" "" "" "said Pruitt, who complained the EPA more than a dozen times in his previous job." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="451">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "we do not believe in regulation by judicial proceedings, and we take deadlines seriously." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="452">"" "" "" "we also take the law and the authority that is given to us seriously." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="453">However, the EPA statement that Pruitt will sometime use its "authority to delay and all other legally available authority" to ensure that the provisions "are based on a solid policy and the best available information."</seg>
<seg id="454">The Republicans in Congress push for a more comprehensive new version of the ozone rules.</seg>
<seg id="455">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "a draft approved last month is intended to delay the implementation of the 2015 rules by at least eight years." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="456">The measure was not yet set up in the Senate.</seg>
<seg id="457">The New York Attorney General, Eric Schneiderman, who led the coalition of states who had lamented the EPA this week, said the group wanted to maintain legal pressure.</seg>
<seg id="458">"the conversion of the EPA - according to our complaints - is an important gain for health and safety of these 6.7 million New Yorkers and the more than 115 million Americans who are directly affected by the smog that flows into their communities," said Schneiderman.</seg>

<seg id="465">Tumlingen celebrates 750 years of St. Hilarius-Church</seg>
<seg id="466">750 years of St. Hilarius-Church: on the occasion of the anniversary of the church, the old cemetery area in Tumlingen on Sunday, 16 July, is invited to a serenade at 4: 30 p.m.</seg>
<seg id="467">Whether its idyllic location and beautiful views of the village is the historic St. Hilarius system a popular place to stay.</seg>
<seg id="468">The visitors of the Sixth Benefiz Serenade can be enchanted by this powerful place.</seg>
<seg id="469">The rescue and preservation of the oldest building in the village have made friends and supporters Tumlingens their concerns.</seg>
<seg id="470">"" "" "" "Walter Martini stresses:" "" "" "" "it is a unique village gem." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="471">In 1267 St. Hilariuskapelle was first mentioned in documents: count Hermann von Sulz sold "the mountain with the parish church of Tumlingen and the Vogtei" at Magister Eberhard von Horb and his brother Dietrich for 20 Mark silver.</seg>
<seg id="472">According to the document, on the hill of Tumlinger, apart from the former parish church, there was also a splendid courtyard, which belonged to the church or the patron saint and not the other way around.</seg>
<seg id="473">There were also people there.</seg>
<seg id="474">As it emerges from the description of the Oberamtes Freudenstadt from 1858, it was next to the Unterdorf and the Oberdorf, which are still to be recognized today in the townscape of Tumlingen, the "mountain" of the third, the magnificent settlement-core of the village.</seg>
<seg id="475">Old maps dating back to 1600 are supporting these historical facts.</seg>
<seg id="476">The right of patronage arose from the early medieval church law.</seg>
<seg id="477">A gentleman who built a church and occupied with a priest, continued to remain the owner of this church and could also bequeath this church.</seg>
<seg id="478">This was accompanied by the right to appoint a pastor or to propose a new parish priest to the bishop.</seg>
<seg id="479">There were three altars in the church and two bells on the tower.</seg>
<seg id="480">The size of the two is shattered at Christmas 1673.</seg>
<seg id="481">The newly created bell sounded for the first time in 1692, but later had to be handed over to the Second World War in 1942.</seg>
<seg id="482">In the Thirty Years' War (1616 to 1648) window panes were inserted and the belfry were stolen.</seg>
<seg id="483">The roof was leaking.</seg>
<seg id="484">In 1796 French troops camped near the church.</seg>
<seg id="485">They broke out the pulpit and the church-mill and used it as firewood.</seg>
<seg id="486">The remains of the church threatened to collapse in 1809.</seg>
<seg id="487">Until 1869 the tomb of Hilarius cemetery also served as the last resting place for the dead from Hörschweiler.</seg>
<seg id="488">In 1823 the cemetery was extended and the church of Hilariuskirche was demolished.</seg>
<seg id="489">Only the steeple was left standing.</seg>
<seg id="490">In the New Year's Eve 1834 a storm split the steeple and half collapsed.</seg>
<seg id="491">In order to prevent misfortune, the tower was abandoned.</seg>
<seg id="492">Only the tower still existing today was preserved as a witness of the 750-year-old church history.</seg>
<seg id="493">Today Horst Kallberger and Rolf-Dieter Wasem are cultivating the Hilarius system as successor of Dieter Dockhorn.</seg>
<seg id="494">As organizers, the friends and supporters Tumlingens on Sunday, July 16, invite the sixth Serenade to the old cemetery at St. Hilariuskapelle.</seg>
<seg id="495">This is designed by the combo of the Kepler-Gymnasium Freudenstadt and with contributions by Kurt Kübler and Reinhold Matteis.</seg>
<seg id="496">Local manager Hartmut Romann is talking about the final word.</seg>
<seg id="497">The program starts at 4.30 p.m.</seg>
<seg id="498">Admission is from 3: 30 pm.</seg>
<seg id="499">To the end of the Serenade, a trunk takes place in front of the cemetery.</seg>
<seg id="500">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "enjoy a summer evening under the shade of old trees and with a wide view across meadows down to the forest," "" "" "" "the organizers challenge the fantastic views." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="501">The Serenade takes place only in dry weather.</seg>
<seg id="502">The organizers are hoping for many supporters for the preservation of the historic St. Hilarius system, which is of importance for tumors and listeners.</seg>
<seg id="503">The friends and supporters of Tumlingens feel particularly committed to their home care, as Serenade-organiser Walter Martini reaffirms.</seg>
<seg id="504">Association wants to test approval of wind turbines</seg>
<seg id="505">Boisheim defends himself "does not see a legal precondition for construction and has therefore turned to the councils.</seg>
<seg id="506">"" "" "" "the" "" "" "" "Boisheim" "" "" "" "Association calls upon Andreas Coenen (CDU) to take back his approval for the construction of planned wind turbines in the Boisheimer Nette." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="507">It is unlawful.</seg>
<seg id="508">The association argues that at the time of approval on December 30, 2016 at the Boisheimer Nette no wind turbines could have been approved, as at the time in Viersen only at the border to Schwalmtal a wind power concentration zone existed.</seg>
<seg id="509">Within this concentration zone, construction and operation of wind turbines is basically possible, but at the same time the concentration zone causes the exclusion of wind energy utilization for the rest of the city.</seg>
<seg id="510">Such zones are intended to prevent "asparagus" of the landscape.</seg>
<seg id="511">The city of Viersen had a second wind-force concentration zone in the Boisheimer Nette, a few days earlier, but the district government of Düsseldorf had not approved, because of a mold defect.</seg>
<seg id="512">"according to Christoph Erkens, Chairman of" Boisheim, "Christoph Erkens, president of" Boisheim, "is not unlawful due to the lack of planning rights."</seg>
<seg id="513">State-of-the-art status: before the summer break, the city council has once again decided on the wind concentration zone in the Boisheimer Nette; approval by the district government is still pending.</seg>
<seg id="514">"" "" "" "recognition:" "" "" "" "at this point, the granting of approval for the construction of wind turbines is legally excluded." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="515">The circle confirms the receipt of the request.</seg>
<seg id="516">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "the corresponding letter has entered the circle of Viersen since last week," "" "" "" "said a spokesman." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="517">The circle takes them on the occasion of reviewing the matter again.</seg>
<seg id="518">However, they do not expect the procedure to be stopped.</seg>
<seg id="519">With regard to ongoing proceedings in the Administrative Court, the circle on Thursday did not want to express itself in terms of content on the argumentation of the association "Boisheim."</seg>
<seg id="520">The NEW Re, a subsidiary of the NEW, is planning the construction of four 200-metre-high wind turbines on an area at the Boisheimer Nette.</seg>
<seg id="521">Last year, the company, in which the city of Viersen was indirectly involved, had concluded leases with the owner of the approximately 65 hectares of land.</seg>
<seg id="522">With the construction of the four wind turbines, the electricity needs of around 11 400 households should be covered - this corresponds to roughly one fifth of the electricity needs of all four-sened households.</seg>
<seg id="523">The NEW Re aims to invest some 20 million euros.</seg>
<seg id="524">Last summer, Viersen's City Council gave the green light to the purchase of three wind turbines in the Linnich wind park near Aachen and a participation in a wind turbine plant in Übach-Palenberg in Heinsberg district.</seg>

<seg id="532">Bad Langensalaer and people from the region are to rediscover shopping in the city centre in September.</seg>
<seg id="533">The business association and the municipal administration intend to use the weekend on September 8 and 9 in order to entice the inhabitants to the shopping spree in the city centre.</seg>
<seg id="534">As the chairman of the commercial association, Christian König, announced, the "Heimat-Shoppen" weekend will raise customers awareness of what offers their own city holds apart from the usual supermarket goods.</seg>
<seg id="535">Accordingly, a market with regional suppliers is planned, similar to the weekly market.</seg>
<seg id="536">In addition, domestic companies should present themselves to their training places.</seg>
<seg id="537">In addition, the shops of the city centre will invite you to go shopping at midnight.</seg>
<seg id="538">In doing so, the action is aimed not only on residents of the city and the nearer region.</seg>
<seg id="539">In preparation are commercials on the radio, an internet video and printed bags pointing to the action weekend, says Christian König.</seg>
<seg id="540">Municipal administration and business association co-operate with the Chamber of Commerce and Industry.</seg>
<seg id="541">This makes the commercial association and the city a further stage of the project "Attractive city centre."</seg>
<seg id="542">This includes new offers, such as the first "Active Day" to Brunnenfest, with sales soffed Sunday, talks with all professionals and hosts in order to move them to active participation.</seg>
<seg id="543">Also attractive offers on Saturday and the renouncement of parking fees on this day are part of the concept.</seg>
<seg id="544">In addition, customer potentials should be newly developed or re-opened.</seg>
<seg id="545">These include spa guests and tourists.</seg>
<seg id="546">But also many locals lost the city centre when shopping out of sight.</seg>
<seg id="547">In the end everyone would have to contribute to liven the city center - to landlords, businesses of the whole city and clubs.</seg>
<seg id="548">It was a matter of overcoming the lethargy with a network that had spread to some extent in the spring.</seg>
<seg id="549">Birgit Streich, head of the IHK-Center in Mühlhausen, announced that five Thuringian cities take part in Germany's third "home-shopping" day.</seg>
<seg id="550">In addition to Bad Langensalza, this is Weimar, Sömmerda, Heiligenstadt and Bleicherode.</seg>
<seg id="551">"" "" "" "the day should" "" "" "" "promote the appreciation of local trade and emphasize its importance for the common good of our cities," "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="552">The action under the leadership of the IHK and with many partners also makes it clear that every citizen can influence his / her purchasing behaviour as a direct environment.</seg>

<seg id="590">According to FBI files received by NBC News, more than 50 men from Monroe and the surrounding counties were suspected in the Lynching process.</seg>
<seg id="591">But no one ever was accused.</seg>
<seg id="592">Although the suspects remain free on foot for decades, civil rights activists say that the double motivation for Lynch actions throughout the city has always been known: politics and sex.</seg>
<seg id="593">In April 1946, a decision by the Supreme Court of Justice allowed the black citizens in Georgia to vote for their vote for the first time in summer.</seg>

<seg id="604">For almost a decade, Cassandra Greene has conducted the annual delivery of Moore Ford Bridge Lynch-Morde.</seg>

<seg id="609">Rehearsals for this year's production began in June, and on the first day almost 30 actors - a dozen whites and the rest of the blacks - went into a room and listened as Greene started a well-rehearsed overview of the piece.</seg>
<seg id="610">Wade Marbaugh is a Greenes Co-director.</seg>

<seg id="629">Everyone is busy getting this right, not just because of the game, but also because of the memory of the four killed people.</seg>
<seg id="630">The scene again starts again.</seg>
<seg id="631">This time, when Rascona says the N word, he says it sharply and with imprint.</seg>
<seg id="632">Absolutely no one laughs.</seg>
<seg id="633">This repetition ends nonviolent and fast.</seg>
<seg id="634">There are cries, shots and then silence.</seg>
<seg id="635">A woman clothed with a mournful dress stands above the bodies of the actors and leads Billie Holidays in mourning "Strange Fruit."</seg>
<seg id="636">Her voice breaks with every second word.</seg>
<seg id="637">About a hundred meters behind it a group of about four dozen audience wipes sweat and tears from the eyes.</seg>
<seg id="638">The audience is divided almost evenly between black and white.</seg>

<seg id="641">Until this point, the murders have remained an anecdote, but now, if you stand in the same country where the lynch murders took place, the air feels spooky.</seg>
<seg id="642">When the last notes of the song sound, Greene invites the crowd to come closer and inspect the dead bodies.</seg>
<seg id="643">Children sit in their heads, register the fake blood and the silent bodies and whisper each other.</seg>

<seg id="753">On the ground floor, it would provide a living space - about 55 square meters - and an adjacent terrace with an area of 70 square meters for a special price.</seg>
<seg id="754">The administration and the majority of the Municipal Council pretend not to foresee such a common space as a meeting place only for the inhabitants of seniorous living, but openly into the community.</seg>
<seg id="755">For example, the word "Strickcafe" made the round.</seg>

<seg id="764">Yvonne Staiger necessarily speaks for the common room - but absolutely against a municipal participation.</seg>
<seg id="765">It sees behind it a covert subsidy to any already wealthy or even foreign investors.</seg>

<seg id="883">New results of Swedish asylum application testing published</seg>
<seg id="884">The recent results of tests for asylum seekers in Sweden, which have undergone a new method of medical evaluation of their age, show that more than 80 percent of the tested persons are older than 18 years. but not everyone believes in the accuracy of these results.</seg>
<seg id="885">The Swedish authority for Forensic Medicine (medicinalverket) commenced the tests last year.</seg>
<seg id="886">During the asylum procedure, they should make more accurate the appraisal of the age after the Swedish Migration Service (Migration Cement) was criticized for errors in assessing the correct age of some refugees who were minor.</seg>
<seg id="887">Until today, migration has been sent to 6,880 cases and the Forensic Medicine Agency has now published the results of a total of 2,481 tests from mid-March to 31 July 2017.</seg>
<seg id="888">Eighty percent (2002) were judged as 18 or older, while in another 25 cases the Forensic Medicine Agency judged that the person was "possibly 18 years or older."</seg>
<seg id="889">"" "" "" "in 432 cases the conclusion was that the person" "" "" "" "may be under 18 years old." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="890">The tests are performed only in cases where the age of the person is questioned.</seg>
<seg id="891">According to Johan Göransson from the Forensic Medicine Agency, the results are consistent over the past few months.</seg>
<seg id="892">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "we don't see a big difference in the statistics of the past months, the numbers are fairly constant," "" "" "" "he said to The Local magazine." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="893">The high proportion of cases where the person has been assessed for over 18 years does not necessarily mean that the asylum seeker has lied about his age.</seg>
<seg id="894">In May the agency published the results of 581 tests and said that there are 442 cases that suggest that the examined person is 18 years or older. "</seg>
<seg id="895">When the paper Svenska Dagbladet examined the 581 results published, she found out that in 243 of these cases the person had frankly said that she was 18 years old this year.</seg>
<seg id="896">The method of medical retirement, in which X-rays of wisdom teeth and MRI images of knee joints are made, which are then analyzed by dentists and radiologists, has also been criticised in some areas.</seg>
<seg id="897">A skeptic is the endocrinologist Claude Marcus of the Karolinska Institute whose work consists of assessing the biological maturity of people to see whether they went earlier or later than usually through puberty.</seg>
<seg id="898">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "I had reason to think about it and I don't think the type of measurement should be used." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="899">To judge the biological age in this way is very uncertain.</seg>
<seg id="900">"" "" "" "if we cannot say that, we shouldn't do as if we could," "" "" "" "he said to the Metro." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="901">Göransson from the Forensic Medicine Agency, however, defended the accuracy of the tests: "in general, you can say that the risk of having a child as an adult is low.</seg>
<seg id="902">"" "" "" "the biggest risk is that if the person is under 18, in this case, this is about 10 percent." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="903">Full in the Plan</seg>
<seg id="904">The work on the three bridges of the highway 108 between Lauterbach and Schramberg is proceeding well.</seg>
<seg id="905">A seven-tonne concrete section was installed on Wednesday at the bridge at the eastern outskirts of Lauterbach.</seg>
<seg id="906">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "we are very good at the time, it works great," "" "" "" "says Reinhold Leicht, Head of Construction at the Department of Road Engineering and Transport in the Regional Council of Freiburg." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="907">In April the works began at the same time on all three refurbishment-dependent bridges between Schramberg and Lauterbach.</seg>
<seg id="908">The end of the building is scheduled for October and Leicht is sure that the schedule will be respected.</seg>
<seg id="909">The first bridge, coming from Schramberg, crosses the Trombach.</seg>
<seg id="910">It is a arch bridge made of concrete, covered with red Buntsandstein and has a total length of 4.80 metres.</seg>
<seg id="911">It was built in 1900.</seg>
<seg id="912">Like the other two bridges, it has now come into the years.</seg>
<seg id="913">To ensure stability and road safety, the three structures are now thoroughly rehabilitated.</seg>
<seg id="914">The other two bridges lead over the Lauterbach.</seg>
<seg id="915">They are made of red Buntsandstein.</seg>
<seg id="916">Both were built in 1939 and are twelve, respectively 10,60 metres long.</seg>
<seg id="917">The bridge at the entrance of Lauterbach on Wednesday morning on the north side has a 1.30 meter wide and seven tons of heavy so-called bridge cap.</seg>
<seg id="918">This is an edge fixing that is also used as a way of operation.</seg>
<seg id="919">A 2.20-metre wide bridge cap is to be used on Friday at the southern part of the bridge.</seg>
<seg id="920">Then the pedestrian walkway is to take place.</seg>
<seg id="921">The special thing about this is that these are finished parts, a patent of the Schramberger company Dizwo.</seg>
<seg id="922">The other two bridges are already equipped with the patented bridge caps.</seg>
<seg id="923">Special fingertip feeling has required laying of lines through the building in Lauterbach.</seg>
<seg id="924">Because there is also a fibre-optic cable to which many companies are connected.</seg>
<seg id="925">The residents were informed about the project beforehand in advance of the work.</seg>
<seg id="926">Fish and crayfish had to be fished.</seg>
<seg id="927">For the bridges between the building yard and the collecting point towards Schramberg, traffic is regulated by a traffic light.</seg>
<seg id="928">For the construction work on the bridge at the Lauterbach village entrance, the road in the area of the bridge at the height of the hotels "Tannenhof" and "Seven Linden" is fully closed.</seg>
<seg id="929">The cost of the three fractions is 700 000 euros.</seg>
<seg id="930">The whole is financed by the country.</seg>

<seg id="932">It is not so common that parties draw on a strand, but when it comes to the alternative for Germany (AfD), it comes together, which would otherwise be difficult to reconcile.</seg>
<seg id="933">The parties represented in the chalk-day volcanic Eifel (CDU, SPD, Grüne, FDP, FWG, Linke) belong to a broad alliance, which on that day shows a peaceful flag, because the AfD invites in the Gerolsteiner Stadthalle in Rondell for "big campaign opening."</seg>

<seg id="942">How did the AfD actually come to Gerolstein?</seg>
<seg id="943">Mario Hompes from the AfD vulgar was reported to have tried such an event and received the supplement.</seg>
<seg id="944">The 45-year-old from Gönnersdorf had asked in Daun first, but there was a cancellation because of the already built Laurentius church there were not enough parking spaces available.</seg>
<seg id="945">So now the Rondell, Hompes is happy that "we can have such a nice event here."</seg>
<seg id="946">"" "" "" "he says:" "" "" "" "this is the good right of the people, the main thing, it remains peaceful." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="947">This is also done: around 20 o'clock a band for entertainment at the rear seats, in the Stadthalle several speakers, among them the Rhineland-Palatinate AfD chairman Uwe Junge.</seg>
<seg id="948">There are about 200 listeners in the hall, waiting to see that the top candidate for the Bundestag election, Alice Weider, and the deputy Federal President Beatrix of Storch keep their speeches.</seg>
<seg id="949">The police presence remains unchanged, but so far the officials had a quiet evening.</seg>
<seg id="950">The AfD event takes a little more than an hour, the guests on the forecourt have a longer breath, but also there is time to clean up shortly after 21: 00 p.m.</seg>
<seg id="951">The police can crush - no special incidents.</seg>

<seg id="955">Both soloists are winners and winners of numerous international competitions and have held positions in European top-class orchestras.</seg>
<seg id="956">Thus Petkov's solo trumpeter is the renowned Concertgebouw Orchestra Amsterdam and Frederic Belli is Soloposun of the SWR Symphony Orchestra.</seg>

<seg id="1036">He retired in 2016 and also covers the title "princleisup."</seg>
<seg id="1037">Since Henrik in Denmark did not get the title and function he wanted, he did not see himself equal to his wife - not after death, Lene Balleby said, the chief speaker of the Danish royal house.</seg>
<seg id="1038">Where the last resting-place of the 83-year-old will ultimately be, is still unclear.</seg>
<seg id="1039">But he did not intend to be buried in his French homeland, but in Denmark.</seg>
<seg id="1040">He likes the country he worked for over the last 50 years.</seg>
<seg id="1041">Henri de Laborde de Monpezat, son of a French nobility, met Margrethe in London in 1965.</seg>
<seg id="1042">On the Thames, he worked in the French embassy.</seg>
<seg id="1043">While his later wife saw the popular sympathies of the people, Prince Henrik had a heavy standing in the Danes in his almost 50-year reign.</seg>
<seg id="1044">In an autobiography, Henrik wrote about the first years in Denmark: "a few months after my arrival everything I did was criticized.</seg>
<seg id="1045">My Danish was wavering, I preferred wine instead of beer, silk stumps instead of knitting socks, Citroën instead of Volvo, tennis instead of football.</seg>

<seg id="1121">How the financial rules of football affect Neymars move to Paris</seg>
<seg id="1122">The rules aimed at preventing unhindered expenditures of European football clubs will not disturb Neymars world record transfer from Spanish Barcelona to the French Paris-Saint Germain.</seg>
<seg id="1123">Any consequences will come for Paris Saint-Germain from the UEFA, as the leading organization that monitors the European game has the power to ban teams from access to the prestigious Champions League tournament.</seg>
<seg id="1124">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "financial fair play rules launched by UEFA in 2011 mean that PSG has to prove at some point that the transfer from Neymar has been financed without major losses." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1125">Barcelona has paid 222 million euros ($262 million) to extract Brazilian from its contract, and Neymar will receive a salary which will amount to several tens of millions of dollars a year.</seg>
<seg id="1126">Here are some of the financial aspects of Neymars move to France.</seg>
<seg id="1127">PSG can surely make money easy for Neymar to sign and bring him to a galaxy of other stars, given the funding of the team through the energy rich sovereign family of Qatar.</seg>
<seg id="1128">Clubs are allowed to spend a lot of money on the purchase of players, but must be subject to legitimate sources of income that allow them to break even point in their business related business.</seg>
<seg id="1129">FFP was designed by Michel Platini after his election to the UEFA president in 2007.</seg>
<seg id="1130">The former French player thought that clubs, who had taken enormous debts in their quest for success, effectively cheated and risked to ruin themselves when banks or owners withdrew their support.</seg>
<seg id="1131">In 2011 FFP shifted from focusing on the debt of the clubs to monitor their losses.</seg>
<seg id="1132">The change meant that the business model, the novel Abramovich originally used in 2003 in Chelsea - bought a club with potential and then invested heavily to improve the team and build a global brand - to become a tougher matter.</seg>
<seg id="1133">During the current three-year period of FFP, which runs until 2018, clubs may take losses of EUR 30 million.</seg>
<seg id="1134">And although Platini has fallen away from the presidency in 2015, his UEFA successor Aleksander Ceferin continues to be deterred by excessive spending.</seg>
<seg id="1135">"surely FFP is not dead and we will definitely strengthen the rules for the future," said Andrea Traverso, who is responsible for FFP in UEFA compared with The Associated Press in the past week.</seg>
<seg id="1136">Although the PSG has paid the Buy-out clause of Neymar in a flat rate, it can distribute the amount for the invoicing over the duration of his contract.</seg>
<seg id="1137">Neymar has signed a five-year contract, so that the drafts for the next five years in the amount of 44.4 million euros can be accounted for in the annual financial statements.</seg>
<seg id="1138">The first wave of FFP sanctions in 2014 met the PSG along with Abu Dhabi, which is owned by Manchester City, with the toughest sanctions.</seg>
<seg id="1139">The PSG received a fine of 60 million euros (at that time $82 million), which was later reduced to 20 million euros - and it was ordered that the team members for the Champions League of the 2014 / 15 season will be limited to 21 players instead of the usual 25 players.</seg>
<seg id="1140">UEFA is looking for clubs that could try to outwit their financial view by pinpointing their revenue by companies associated with the owners of a club.</seg>
<seg id="1141">While a catastrophic company could sponsor the PSG if the value of sponsoring should exceed the standard market rates, UEFA would not count this as legitimate income.</seg>
<seg id="1142">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "this was exactly what happened in 2014 when the UEFA decided that the value of the sponsor of the PSA was inflated by the Qatar Tourism Authority." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1143">It was reported that some of the PSG payments on Neymar could come to Qatar via payments from the Organizing Committee of the 2022 World Cup 2022.</seg>
<seg id="1144">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "but PSG and Qatar have argued that Neymar's World Cup ambassadors are going to be and such a manoeuvre for UEFA regulatory authorities could be easily identified." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1145">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "the previous sanctions against PSG mean that UEFA will be more attentive to ignore any attempt to circumvent the rules." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1146">The UEFA had no preparatory talks with PSG via Neymars Transfer, said on Thursday the people who are familiar with the situation.</seg>
<seg id="1147">They spoke under the condition of anonymity with The Associated Press, because they were not authorised to discuss the PSG situation.</seg>
<seg id="1148">The last published reports show that PSG 2015 / 16 has achieved a profit of more than 10 million euros with a turnover of €542.4 million.</seg>
<seg id="1149">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "the accounts for the last fiscal year have to be published." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1150">PSG expects Neymars to be a blessing for sponsoring deals, merchandising and jersey sales.</seg>
<seg id="1151">The association assumes that sales will rise by at least 30 percent after signature.</seg>
<seg id="1152">The Spanish League was clearly irritated to see one of the best football players and tried to prevent Neymars away by claiming that PSG would violate the FFP.</seg>
<seg id="1153">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "it is a clear case of" "" "" "" "financing doping" "" "" "" "with the club and the state," "" "" "" "said the President of the La League, Javier Tebas, the Spanish daily AS with regard to Qatar's last owners." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1154">Arsenal-Manager Arsene Wenger, whose club is owned by an American Sport Tycoon, shares the reservations of La League against a state that finances a club.</seg>
<seg id="1155">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "it is the consequence of the ownership and that has completely changed the entire landscape of football in the last 15 years," "" "" "" "Wenger said on Thursday." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1156">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "once a country has an association, everything is possible." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="1158">Swiss is looking for a new shoddy supplier</seg>
<seg id="1159">In recent years Chocolat Frey board chocolate has produced chocolate for Swiss.</seg>
<seg id="1160">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "now the sweet cooperation is facing a possible end:" "" "" "" "the airline is writing the order again." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1161">On request of the news agency SDA, Swiss speakers Meike Fuhlrott confirmed a corresponding report by the news agency SDA on Friday.</seg>
<seg id="1162">According to current planning, the airline will conclude a new contract in the first half of 2018.</seg>
<seg id="1163">The products were reviewed every two to three years and subjected to quality control.</seg>
<seg id="1164">"we are very satisfied with the current supplier Chocolat Frey," said the spokesperson.</seg>
<seg id="1165">Approximately 17 million small red-white wrapped chocolate bars distribute up to 14 grams a year before landing to the passengers.</seg>
<seg id="1166">Swiss did not want to provide any information about the costs.</seg>
<seg id="1167">Industry insiders estimate the volume of orders in accordance with "Northwestern Switzerland" from 1.5 to 2 million Swiss francs - the Migros subsidiary generates annual sales of around one billion Swiss francs.</seg>
<seg id="1168">But the advertising effect is more important once and for all: it is a prestigious order for a shooter manufacturer.</seg>
<seg id="1169">Swiss does not want to betray the number of applicants with the new tender.</seg>
<seg id="1170">But only Swiss manufacturers are concerned.</seg>
<seg id="1171">According to the newspaper article, Chocolat Frey is trying to revitalise the Treaty establishing the Spring of 2018.</seg>
<seg id="1172">For the SDA, the biggest Swiss chocolate manufacturer was not available for an opinion.</seg>
<seg id="1173">Swiss Life has been distributing chocolate bars on board their flights since 2006.</seg>
<seg id="1174">Prior to signing a contract with Migros subsidiary, Barry Callebaut has supplied chocolate tablets in collaboration with Hug.</seg>
<seg id="1175">The possibility to place the logo Swiss introduced two and a half years ago with the start of the cooperation with Chocolat Frey.</seg>
<seg id="1176">The airline operates with different Swiss chocolate producers.</seg>
<seg id="1177">On long haul flights customers of the First Class are pampered with treats from the confectionery Sprüngli, in Business Class the passengers Schooli von Lindt and in Economy Class Shoggi from Chocolat Frey.</seg>
<seg id="1178">Swiss shoggi by Chocolat Frey, both in business and in Economy Class, distributes on the short circuit.</seg>

<seg id="1182">Also with the first attempt the Polish title defender Piotr Malachowski, who threw 65,13 metres far, qualified for the final battle.</seg>
<seg id="1183">Nostalgia goes to "Wet Hot American Summer" and "Comrade Detective"</seg>
<seg id="1184">This repetition of history is at the same time nostalgic because of the glorious days of the characters of the 80's, for the 90-year Grunge era (when the thinkers David Wain and Michael Showalter played the Sketch-comedy "The State" for MTV), and for themselves - that is, for 2001 before their stars, like Elizabeth Banks, Amy Poehler and Paul Rudd were going to bigger things.</seg>
<seg id="1185">As a cultural artifact, it is equally a parody and embodiment of our facebook-capable era of permanent memories.</seg>
<seg id="1186">But as franchise it feels like the time would scarce.</seg>
<seg id="1187">"first Day of Camp" worked surprisingly well, not only because of its absurd humour (it contained an original story for a talking can of vegetables spoken by H. Jon Benjamin).</seg>
<seg id="1188">By placing themselves on the core of the Gags - middle-aged actors play horny children that will grow - they still managed to win the last part of the Witzes.</seg>
<seg id="1189">"ten Years Later," with his adults now playing adults, is less emotionally rooted and his parody is more based on the watering principle, including a reef on the Stalker films of the 90's as "The Hand That Rocks the Cradle."</seg>
<seg id="1190">At one point, a character drives through an Apple-Powerbook, some Inline Skates and "a number of other things from 1991."</seg>
<seg id="1191">Many of the central stories are the same.</seg>
<seg id="1192">The lovely Coop (Mr. Showoff), now Romanaut, has not forgotten Katie (Marguerite Moreau).</seg>
<seg id="1193">Victor (Ken Marino) still has not lost his virginity.</seg>
<seg id="1194">And there is another crazy malicious Plot, included in the Ronald Reagan (also Mr. Showalter), who is now supported by George H. W. Bush (a good impression of Michael Ian Black).</seg>
<seg id="1195">As always, the exams are the best part of franchise.</seg>
<seg id="1196">It is a lot of fun to see the eternally young Mr. Rudd, who shows Matt Dillons's sublippenbart of "Singles," whose former Big-Man-on-Camp Andy feels like an old boy.</seg>
<seg id="1197">It's the moments of random madness that could heat this franchise like a sort of repetitive "Seven Up!" series until he achieves that which I consider his logical conclusion: "wet Hot American Summer: Twenty Years Later," whose last scene will show the band premiere of "Wet Hot American Summer."</seg>
<seg id="1198">"Comrade Detective" on Amazon now recalls another kind of nostalgia: the revival of the Cold War of "The Americans," to the film "Atomic Blonde," and even "GLOW" with its East-West ringing iconography.</seg>
<seg id="1199">The comedy created by Brian Gatewood and Alessandro Tanaka is to be a found TV series: a Romanian drama of the eighties with the two policemen as friends, two officers from Bucharest who fight for truth, atheism and the road of Marxism-Leninism.</seg>
<seg id="1200">The main roles - a hard-boiled Gregor and an idealistic Iosef - are played by Florin Piersic Jr. and Corneliu ulici, whose dialogues are synced by Channing Tatum (also an executable producer) and Joseph Gordon-Levitt in English.</seg>
<seg id="1201">It's an ingenious idea.</seg>
<seg id="1202">But it is not much more than an idea.</seg>
<seg id="1203">There are some nice days to watch (the police spend the time watching chess on TV, as Americans might do with football).</seg>
<seg id="1204">And the list of famous speakers - including Jenny Slate, Nick Offerman, Mahershala Ali and Chloe Sevigny - ensures a decent game "Find out the voice."</seg>
<seg id="1205">But "Comrade Detective" is very committed to the truthfulness of a desperate propaganda drama - a murderer wearing a Reagan mask is involved - that it often plays like a single.</seg>
<seg id="1206">With six long episodes it's moving, and the comedy is not fast or often enough.</seg>
<seg id="1207">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "Comrade Detective," "" "" "" "could better deliver its agitprop satire because Gregor and Iosef continue to visit the American embassy, whose lobby is always occupied by two thick men who devour a bunch of hamburgers." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1208">The message for the imagined Communist crowd is that the Western culture can make everything to feed for a ballot.</seg>
<seg id="1209">The fictitious Romanian creators were not wrong: we even do it with our own younger history and with theirs.</seg>
<seg id="1210">Blow against drug mafia in the country</seg>
<seg id="1211">The police did a blow against the Italian mafia in Baden-Württemberg.</seg>
<seg id="1212">On Wednesday morning, numerous objects were searched in the Black Forest Baar District, in Rottweil, Konstanz, Esslingen and Stuttgart, as the Public Prosecutor's Office announced on Friday.</seg>
<seg id="1213">15 accused were arrested between the ages of 25 and 77 and issued arrest warrants against them.</seg>
<seg id="1214">Moreover, the officials assured large quantities of marijuana and cocaine, firearms as well as several hundred thousand euros.</seg>
<seg id="1215">In the case of simultaneous raids in Italy two persons were arrested.</seg>
<seg id="1216">There were German arrest warrants against the two suspects.</seg>
<seg id="1217">The two are probably shipped to Germany.</seg>
<seg id="1218">Italian and Bavarian investigators were involved in the campaign.</seg>
<seg id="1219">A total of more than 300 policemen were deployed.</seg>
<seg id="1220">The Mafia members are accused of organised crime crime, severe acts of violence, attempted murder as well as robbery and blackmail.</seg>
<seg id="1221">Since summer 2016, the public prosecutor's office has established Constance against organised drug trafficking in Southern Germany.</seg>
<seg id="1222">There was a lively exchange between the public prosecutor in Konstanz and Palermo and the investigators of the Kripo Rottweil had almost daily contact with their colleagues in Sicily.</seg>
<seg id="1223">Therefore the big assignment was accompanied by four officials from Palermo on Wednesday morning.</seg>
<seg id="1224">The aim of the investigation was mainly Italian citizens with a close relationship with the Italian mafia.</seg>
<seg id="1225">Also an incident on May 27 in Hüfingen, where several shots were fired at a restaurant early in the morning, is likely to go to the bank account.</seg>

<seg id="1232">The data are therefore administered by approximately 600 foreign national authorities in Germany.</seg>

<seg id="1234">In individual cases, data from 1921 had been found, "by people who are no longer alive, or of citizens who have become German citizens and are not supposed to appear in the Register any more."</seg>

<seg id="1262">The Bank of England will hold interest rates at 0.25%</seg>
<seg id="1263">The Bank of England is expected to announce later that interest rates will remain unchanged after the weak economic growth and the weakening of inflation have dampened speculation on an increase.</seg>
<seg id="1264">The Bank of England warned that economic growth will remain "sluggish" when it held interest rates on family income in the midst of a growing pressure.</seg>
<seg id="1265">The political decision-makers of the Monetary Committee (MPC) of the Bank voted with 6 to 2 to hold interest rates to 0.25%, with fewer members in this month, as weak economic growth weakened the support for an increase.</seg>
<seg id="1266">In its quarterly inflation forecast, the Bank reduced its growth forecasts for 2017 to 1.7% and for 2018 to 1.6% and warned that pressure would continue to rise to domestic income, with inflation expected to rise to just under 3% in the autumn.</seg>
<seg id="1267">But she signalled that in the next few years interest increases would be necessary to raise the inflation of Brexit and she said that credit costs would have to rise more than expected in the financial markets.</seg>
<seg id="1268">The members also agreed to withdraw part of the mammoth economic package issued a year after the Brexit.</seg>
<seg id="1269">It will require time for the finance plan to provide cheaper financial resources for banks as of next February, although it was said that it is now expected that it will provide 15 billion pounds more within the scope of this system - with 115 billion pounds sterling.</seg>
<seg id="1270">The Bank said: "in the central forecast of the MPC, gross domestic product (GDP) remains weak at short notice, as the pressure on the real income of households continues to burden consumption."</seg>

<seg id="1285">Before the Bank's final verdict on interest rates, the call for interest rates increased, as inflation increased pressure on hard-to-push budgets, with three political decision-makers demanding an increase of 0.5% in July.</seg>

<seg id="1292">NHS England announced that pre-sexual propositional prophylaxis (prep), which can reduce the risk of infection in high-risk patients by around 86 percent, is now delivered by the health service via a first three-year study for estimated 10,000 people.</seg>
<seg id="1293">He agreed to finance the trial after the Appeals Court confirmed last year a ruling by the Supreme Court that the NHS had the authority to pay for the prep despite the claim that the local authorities should finance it.</seg>
<seg id="1294">The move announced on Thursday was welcomed by NHS UK boss Simon Stevens as "important new intervention," while the National Aids Trust (NAT) described this as a "decisive moment."</seg>
<seg id="1295">Sexual health clinics in London, Brighton, Manchester, Liverpool and Sheffield will be among the first to enable the registration of people and other clinics will follow in October before they will be introduced throughout England in April 2018.</seg>
<seg id="1296">Pretext prophylaxis (prep) is a result of HIV preparations taken before sex to reduce the risk of HIV infection.</seg>
<seg id="1297">Studies have shown that prep has significantly reduced HIV transmission to infections at risk of infection.</seg>
<seg id="1298">Prep prior to sexual intercourse means that just enough drugs are present in the body of a person to prevent an HIV infection.</seg>
<seg id="1299">Such medications can be taken every day or so already two hours before sexual intercourse.</seg>
<seg id="1300">Those who are eligible for treatment include gay or bisexual men, transsexuals and people with HIV-positive partners who have not been treated successfully.</seg>
<seg id="1301">In clinics, suitable participants are identified who agree to the study, including men, women, transgenders and individuals who have a partner whose HIV status is not known to be controlled by antiretroviral treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1302">People living in England and registered with a family doctor may also register for a possible participation in their local participating sex clinic.</seg>
<seg id="1303">The program is signed £10 million and NHS England signed a contract to supply the medicines this week after an international competitive procurement.</seg>
<seg id="1304">The study aims to assess the full potential of prep by collecting clinical evidence how it is used, recorded and implemented on a large scale.</seg>
<seg id="1305">Stevens said: "this great new intervention should complement and overtake the far-reaching and increasingly successful efforts to prevent HIV.</seg>
<seg id="1306">"" "" "" "it is another milestone in more than three decades of continuing progress in coping with one of mankind's greatest health challenges." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1307">Deborah Gold, Chief Executive Officer at NAT (National Aids Trust) said: "this is a crucial moment in the fight against HIV.</seg>
<seg id="1308">Prep, if targeted at vulnerable and vulnerable people, provides the opportunity to change the English HIV epidemic.</seg>
<seg id="1309">From September onwards, people with high HIV risk will have access to this NHS-funded study in England to develop a new instrument that is truly individually controlled and not subject to a transaction with a partner, which leads to the improvement of many, many lives.</seg>
<seg id="1310">We warmly welcome this announcement. "</seg>
<seg id="1311">Ian Green, Chief Executive Officer of the Terrence Higgins Trust, said: "the priority must now be to ensure that the study is carried out quickly across the country and that no one who has a risk for HIV is left behind.</seg>
<seg id="1312">"" "" "" "now that the prep test medicine has been procured, we are on the best way to protect more than 10,000 HIV infected people." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1313">Sharon Hodgson, Minister of Health, said: "the start of the prep process is welcome and overdue after months of delay and hesitant implementation by the government.</seg>
<seg id="1314">The evidence shows how transformative this drug may be part of our approach to HIV prevention and may end the transmission of this life-changing infection.</seg>
<seg id="1315">This attempt brings us a step closer to understanding the advantages of prep.</seg>
<seg id="1316">Now it is important that this study is carried out as quickly as possible across the country to protect people who are infected with HIV, and that it will help us to step closer to the eradication of HIV in society. "</seg>
<seg id="1317">Living the big life: mezzanine and clever designer-tricks have turned this small Earls Court apartment into a spacious home</seg>
<seg id="1318">Joanne Leigh, a former bank with a passion for real estate, shrank in 2014 from a big house in Knightsbridge to an Earls Court apartment.</seg>
<seg id="1319">It is on the first floor of an elegant Queen Anne Terrace - and it is proof of the new design that Joanne has not packed her bags and sold her bags.</seg>
<seg id="1320">"before that, I lived with my ex in Knightsbridge in a much larger room," Joanne says.</seg>
<seg id="1321">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "I sought something comparable to my price." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1322">I was shown this apartment in Earls Court, and it had the same high ceilings.</seg>
<seg id="1323">"" "" "" "I fell in love with them and made an offer this day." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1324">Since the first inspection, the 1,000 square foot apartment was completely overhauled.</seg>
<seg id="1325">Originally, a one-bedroom property with a nested layout - you had to go through the kitchen to get to the bedroom - wanted to add a lot of storage space and a mezzanine to make optimal use of the generous ceiling height.</seg>
<seg id="1326">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "I wanted high ceilings, large windows, lots of light." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1327">That was my requirement, "she says.</seg>
<seg id="1328">For this purpose, she commissioned the Architectural and Design Studio Duck & Shed from Erfan Azadi from Notting Hill to use 12.5 feet high ceilings and to create a home that was not only a development but also a place to live for Joanne.</seg>
<seg id="1329">The ceiling was not big enough to place two rooms above each other so that the architectural challenge was to create a mezzanine where one could stand.</seg>
<seg id="1330">Erfan had to think creatively to solve the issue.</seg>
<seg id="1331">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "the steel works are quite complicated," "" "" "" "he explains." "" "" "</seg>
<seg id="1332">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "we had to arrange the rooms so that they were stacked over each other without having to bend." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1333">"" "" "" "it was not just about building a simple platform, but to put the steel in such a way that it had the right height for the function above or below." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1334">This arrangement made it possible for Erfan to place two rooms at full height - with much additional drama.</seg>
<seg id="1335">For the mezzanine a classic copper light window of Retrouvius looks down over the glamorous living area.</seg>
<seg id="1336">Mirrored gold furniture, silver accents and vintage Serge Mouille illumination set the style for the program.</seg>
<seg id="1337">The use of mirrors plays a role in adding theater, space and light.</seg>
<seg id="1338">At both ends a short corridor is mirrored to make it seem longer.</seg>
<seg id="1339">In the kitchen the mirroring feels like a window in another room.</seg>
<seg id="1340">At the entrance, mirrored units offer space for all the cutlery and jars of Joanne.</seg>
<seg id="1341">Through the perception of a glamorous space, the beauty of the living room can shut down the kitchen if it is not used.</seg>
<seg id="1342">Folding kitchens are nothing new.</seg>
<seg id="1343">The special thing about this is that it is a garage door.</seg>
<seg id="1344">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "a bit of engineering art went in," "" "" "" "says Erfan from the steel-reinforced, veneered MDF door." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1345">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "it is very important that when you push the door very easily slides." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1346">Thanks to the clever use of space and storage space, Joanne was able to gain additional 16 m ², an additional bedroom and an improved layout.</seg>
<seg id="1347">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "at the end of the day, you will sell the land - or how your property is estimated," "" "" "" "says Erfan." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1348">"in a rudimentary form, a real estate agent will enter and perform a calculation based on the ground size."</seg>
<seg id="1349">Here they have managed to enlarge the floor space and at the same time use high-quality materials that give the room its luxurious advantage.</seg>
<seg id="1350">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "the materials are the things you touch and therefore help create an emotional bond in a home," "" "" "" "says Erfan." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1351">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "you don't love the electrical sockets in the walls." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1352">These are important, but they don't play with your heart. "</seg>
<seg id="1353">It shows that an apartment can be transformed by a good design and an increased square meter of some standard in something quite amazing.</seg>
<seg id="1354">In fact, like Joanne, you might decide to leave it.</seg>
<seg id="1355">Brothers are fighting for a $500 million real estate empire</seg>
<seg id="1356">Two brothers have been four decades after their Italian family founded the Dynasty, in a dispute over one of the largest real estate imperial Victorias worth over $500 million.</seg>
<seg id="1357">The former director of the 'Carlton Football Club' and developer Colin De Lutis lives in a villa in Toorak, only three doors from his younger brother Paul. he has brought him to the Supreme Court to clarify how their property and their assets are to be divided.</seg>
<seg id="1358">Paul wanted to retire from the family business since 2014, but a sharp conflict on separation takes place in the Supreme Court.</seg>
<seg id="1359">Together with her mother Anna, the brothers have accumulated 38 properties worth more than half a billion dollars, since the 1973 family purchased a shop at Smith Street, Collingwood.</seg>
<seg id="1360">There, the Westco family founded jeans and grew to a chain of 160 retail stores.</seg>
<seg id="1361">It was sold in 1999 for 85 million US dollars.</seg>
<seg id="1362">This money was invested in real estate, and De Lutis's portfolio now includes offices in the city centre, the development areas of Brunswick and Sorrento, the apartments in Gold Coast and Mt Buller as well as shopping centers in the suburbs.</seg>
<seg id="1363">After an agreement with her deceased father, Colin - von Paul described as the "main operator and the dominant personality" in the De Lutis family - about two thirds of the company's assets and Paul about one third.</seg>
<seg id="1364">A court file states that this means that Colin owns property worth $316 million and Paul worth 176 million dollars.</seg>
<seg id="1365">The distribution of real estate and cash has proved to be a direct issue for Paul.</seg>
<seg id="1366">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "the detachments proposed by Colin have left him with what I thought for the best objects," "" "" "" "he wrote in a first Affidavit in 2015." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1367">Last Friday, after several failed negotiations, the first hearing of the Supreme Court took place.</seg>
<seg id="1368">The brothers now also fight for the control of the existing business - of which Colin, as Paul claims, has excluded him.</seg>
<seg id="1369">Colin argues that this is not true, but proposes Paul to manage some possessions incompetently.</seg>
<seg id="1370">In an early Affidavit, which was submitted by Colin, he says he hopes to settle the dispute.</seg>
<seg id="1371">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "my Italian heritage stipulates that the family is the most important priority," "" "" "" "he wrote." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1372">The costs increase in the case, with hundreds of pages with Affidavits, e-mails and reports from companies, including Deloitte, Pitcher Partners and Charter Keck Cramer, and with leading lawyers, including Allan Myers, QC, and from both sides held law firms.</seg>
<seg id="1373">Ms. De Lutis and her deceased husband Luigi were Italian immigrants who operated dairy bars and delicatessen shops in the late 1950 "s and bought a business in Brunswick in the early 1970's.</seg>
<seg id="1374">They used the security to buy the Collingwood property in which Colin opened the first jeans shop of the family.</seg>
<seg id="1375">Colin says he started West co there when he was "in my last years of High School when Paul was still a little child (about 10 years old)."</seg>
<seg id="1376">Anna De Lutis says that she and Luigi, who died in 2012, hoped to share their property with kindness to their sons.</seg>
<seg id="1377">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "Luigi often told me that he never wanted the brothers to come to court," "" "" "" "she wrote." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1378">Two other brothers, Mark and Luke, are no longer part of the De Lutis group of companies, and Colin claims that Mark was paid $10 million and $26 million on leaving the company.</seg>
<seg id="1379">"" "" "" "both Luke and Mark were," "" "" "" "Paul says about the conditions of their financial separation." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1380">Colin has withheld himself very much, although he was a former AFL member of the AFL and after a biography of 2015 by Eddie McGuire the best friend of the TV star.</seg>
<seg id="1381">Fairfax Media contacted Colin and Paul De Lutis and their lawyers.</seg>
<seg id="1382">"" "" "" "only Colin responded by SMS to say" "" "" "" "I really can't say much," "" "" "" "because the case is before the courts." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1383">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "it is very, very sad that my brother Paul decided to sue me and draw our surname through the courts," "" "" "" "he wrote." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1384">In mid-2016, Colin wrote in a letter to the court that he tried to fulfill his brother's demands.</seg>
<seg id="1385">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "our father did not want Paul and I to end up in our current fight," "" "" "" "he said," "" "" "" "still hoping for a solution." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="1388">Trumps new chief of staff plans to limit the media abstinence from the President.</seg>
<seg id="1389">Others have tried and failed.</seg>
<seg id="1390">Perhaps John F. Kelly can actually do it.</seg>
<seg id="1391">If so, he will be the first.</seg>
<seg id="1392">Politico reports that the new Chief of Staff of the White House is planning to restrict the flow of information to President Trump, including news media reports - hoping to hold the boss on a more uniform course.</seg>
<seg id="1393">Here is a piece by Reporter Josh Dawning:</seg>
<seg id="1394">"when John F. Kelly, the new Chief of Staff of the White House, met at his first working day with executive staff, he represented a major problem in President Donald Trumps White House, which he wanted to repair: poor information that has fallen into the hands of the President.</seg>
<seg id="1395">Kelly told the employees that information should flow about him - whether on paper or in briefings - because the president would make better decisions if he would receive good information. "</seg>
<seg id="1396">Kellys diagnosis makes sense, but others have tried to tame trump by monitoring his media diet.</seg>
<seg id="1397">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "President Trumps relationship to television goes back decades - and now, where he is in the White House, his television advertising is still strong." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1398">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "when candidate Trump was angry for unfair reporting, it was productive to show him that he received fair reporting from jobs that were to be persuaded," "" "" "" "said former election campaign adviser Sam Nunberg in February against Politico." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1399">Politicians Tara Palmeri wrote at the time that "the key to keep Trumps Twitter habits under control, according to six ex-election campaign officials, is to ensure that his personal media consumption includes a constant praise."</seg>
<seg id="1400">Okay.</seg>
<seg id="1401">But the idea that Trumps's Twitter custom was ever "under control" is ridiculous.</seg>
<seg id="1402">Maybe these campaign officials know something we don't know - that trumps tweets would have even more combustible without their interventions.</seg>
<seg id="1403">We will probably never know anything about tweets that trump did not send.</seg>
<seg id="1404">If his collaborators have managed to keep anger away from him several times, their efforts have been worthwhile.</seg>
<seg id="1405">But no one has consistently prevented Trump's controversy.</seg>
<seg id="1406">Part of the problem is that people in a White House, composed of competing parties, are constantly trying to present their own agenda by presenting a pump material that may promote their views from the world.</seg>
<seg id="1407">Politico - busy with this story - reported in May about the preference of the advisers to supply questionable information to the president for strategic reasons.</seg>
<seg id="1408">This was an example described by reporters Shane Goldsmith:</seg>
<seg id="1409">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "current and former trump officials say that Trump can react like a volcano to negative press clippings, especially those with humiliating leaks, and to find out where these originate from." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1410">This was exactly what happened at the end of February when somebody maliciously gave a printed copy of an article from GotNews.com, the website of the Internet provocateurs Charles C. Johnson, who accused the deputy chief of staff Katie Walsh, "to be the source behind a pile of leaks" at the White House.</seg>
<seg id="1411">Although Johnson was permanently banished from Twitter for harassment or that he has not offered any concrete evidence, or that he has uttered false accusations in the past and revoke it.</seg>
<seg id="1412">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "Trump read the article and started asking people about Walsh." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1413">Goldmacher added that the former chief of staff, Reince Priebus and the Secretary-General of the White House, Rob Porter, "have tried to implement a system to manage and document the paperwork, the trump gets."</seg>
<seg id="1414">How did that work?</seg>
<seg id="1415">Kelly tries to do the same three months later.</seg>
<seg id="1416">Perhaps he will prove to be more effective as a Priebus, but Trump is still his impulsive self, and his advisors still strive for influence.</seg>
<seg id="1417">These immutable factors make Kellys's mission very difficult.</seg>

<seg id="1445">The Waldhotel Luise is from the former Hotel Birkenhof.</seg>
<seg id="1446">The house in front of the gates of Freudenstadt is currently undergoing renovation and will be opened on 1 March next year.</seg>
<seg id="1447">These are good news for the city.</seg>
<seg id="1448">Because with the closing of the Hotel Birkenhof by the former Ambiente company gesellschaft mbH on April 13, 2014, around 30,000 overnight stays were lost per year and also income from the tourist tax.</seg>
<seg id="1449">In autumn 2014, in view of dramatically increasing numbers of refugees arriving in the county, the hotel building was offered to the councillor as a collective accommodation, which caused controversial discussions.</seg>
<seg id="1450">The city prevented the housing of asylum seekers by setting up a building plan to secure the area as a hotel location.</seg>
<seg id="1451">The decision was not undisputed at that time in the municipal council.</seg>
<seg id="1452">But above all Freudenstadt's Mayor Julian Osswald defended the hotel location and at that time spoke of serious interested parties in the house.</seg>
<seg id="1453">He should be right.</seg>
<seg id="1454">The group of Luisenhotels with Managing Director Birgit Scherer with headquarters in Bad Bergzabern has acquired the former Hotel Birkenhof during a voluntary auction in Berlin and wants to make it a house of the three-star plus category under the name Waldhotel Luise.</seg>
<seg id="1455">The group has four houses with the Freudenstadt object.</seg>
<seg id="1456">Two of them in Bad Bergzabern and one in Bad Herrenalb.</seg>
<seg id="1457">You are called Hotel Luise, Luisenpark, Parkhotel Luise and now Waldhotel Luise.</seg>
<seg id="1458">At the former Hotel Birkenhof there have been building shuttles in front of the entrance for quite some time and when you enter the house, it becomes clear how extensive renovation works are carried out.</seg>
<seg id="1459">The floors were torn out, ceilings partly broken down, old bathtubs removed from the rooms.</seg>
<seg id="1460">The entire hotel building is a single construction site.</seg>
<seg id="1461">There is still much to do until March.</seg>
<seg id="1462">"it's actually a lovely place," says Thomas Scherer in conversation with our newspaper.</seg>
<seg id="1463">Everything is to be renewed in the Black Forest style.</seg>
<seg id="1464">The rooms are equipped with large walk-in showers, the entrance area is redesigned, new windows are installed.</seg>
<seg id="1465">"" "" "" "everything should be" "" "" "" "nice bourgeois" "" "" "" "later, as Thomas Scherer is expressing." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="1467">Swimming pool, wellness area and conference room are part of the facilities.</seg>
<seg id="1468">You don't want to position yourself at the high level of the hotels in Lauterbad, but already at a higher downtown level, Scherer emphasises.</seg>
<seg id="1469">The Waldhotel Luise with its 60 rooms is to be set up wide, Scherer explains.</seg>
<seg id="1470">Individual vacationers, groups or businessmen should feel comfortable in the hotel.</seg>
<seg id="1471">He has already had talks with OB Julian Osswald and tourism director Michael Krause, as Scherer.</seg>
<seg id="1472">The performances of the city are identical to those of the hotel group.</seg>
<seg id="1473">"we are on the same line."</seg>
<seg id="1474">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "after the amount of investment required, Thomas Scherer doesn't want to define exactly." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1475">He pays less than one million euros.</seg>
<seg id="1476">The outdoor spaces are also being brought forward, which is clearly visible.</seg>
<seg id="1477">In a courtyard, there is a large terrace, which will be accessible from the restaurant, which is open to the public.</seg>

<seg id="1479">Russia affair: U.S. Special Enlargement Begins Grand Jury</seg>
<seg id="1480">In the Russia affair around US President Donald Trump, special promoter Robert Mueller should have used a so-called Grand Jury after a report.</seg>
<seg id="1481">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "the body has taken up the work in recent weeks, wrote the" Wall Street Journal "" "" "" "" on appeal to persons familiar with the matter. "" "" "" "</seg>
<seg id="1482">The paper regarded the step as a sign that Mueller had expanded and intensified his investigations.</seg>
<seg id="1483">The broadcaster CNN reported that there were already first events in connection with a meeting between Trumps's oldest son and a Russian lawyer.</seg>
<seg id="1484">U.S. intelligence services have been accusing the Kremlin for a long time to have purposely interfered with the 2016 presidential campaign.</seg>
<seg id="1485">Mueller was investigating whether there were agreements between Trumps election campaign team and Moscow.</seg>
<seg id="1486">The investigation will focus on several men who acted as advisors to the Republicans during the campaign.</seg>
<seg id="1487">According to reports Mueller also took a closer look at more and more trumps in a private and business environment.</seg>
<seg id="1488">The Washington Post, a few weeks ago, wrote that the special agent Trump has personally moved to the center and forbade the accusation whether the President might have impeded the judiciary in the course of the affair.</seg>
<seg id="1489">The main task of Grand Jury is to examine this evidence in possible crime cases and to decide whether an accusation is to be raised.</seg>
<seg id="1490">Grand Jury therefore also called anchor clips.</seg>
<seg id="1491">Most of the time, they are turned on when it comes to larger and controversial cases.</seg>
<seg id="1492">The procedure is always done behind closed doors.</seg>
<seg id="1493">The Panel can also be turned on by the Public Prosecutor to invite individuals to perform under oath.</seg>
<seg id="1494">According to CNN, invitations have already been issued which revolve around the encounter between Donald Trump Jr. and a Russian lawyer.</seg>
<seg id="1495">People who were involved in the meeting had been invited to a statement, it was said in the report.</seg>
<seg id="1496">They should also provide documents.</seg>
<seg id="1497">Besides Trump Jr. also Trumps consultant and son-in-law Jared Kushner and his former election campaign manager Paul Manafort also attended the conversation.</seg>
<seg id="1498">Legal experts said on Thursday evening in US television that the introduction shows that Mueller should not be intimidated in his work and that if necessary, he wanted to act quickly.</seg>
<seg id="1499">But it does not necessarily mean that the Grand Jury will be switched on at the end to decide on the collection of an indictment.</seg>
<seg id="1500">Nevertheless, the establishment of the committee is the beginning of a new phase in the investigations and a new cause of concern for President Trump.</seg>
<seg id="1501">In the midst of the new revelations, the President used a speech in West Virginia on Thursday evening to present the Russia affair as a campaign of his political opponents.</seg>
<seg id="1502">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "Russia's story is a total invention," "" "" "" "said Trump." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1503">"" "" "" "the subject gives the democrats an opportunity to" "" "" "" "feel good, because they have nothing else to talk about." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1504">His special advisor, Ty Cobb, stated in an opinion that he didn't know anything about the establishment of a Grand Jury.</seg>
<seg id="1505">But she usually works in secret, he stressed.</seg>
<seg id="1506">The White House supports any action that accelerates the work of the special agent in a fair way.</seg>
<seg id="1507">The former FBI leader James Comey said three times that he was not determined against the president.</seg>
<seg id="1508">I have no reason to assume that something has changed in this way, but it was further explained in the explanation.</seg>
<seg id="1509">But Mueller had only been deployed after Trump Comey had fired.</seg>
<seg id="1510">Because of this rationale, accusations against Trump have become louder, he did not want to obstruct justice.</seg>
<seg id="1511">Comey said in June before a Senate Committee, Trump asked him to set up the investigations against former national security adviser Michael Flynn.</seg>
<seg id="1512">The president is under great pressure because of the investigation.</seg>
<seg id="1513">After the presentation of US media, the White House collected material against the special agent and its staff.</seg>
<seg id="1514">This triggered speculations on whether pump must be released.</seg>
<seg id="1515">Unlike an independent special agent of the Congress, such as the Watergate affair surrounding the later retired president Richard Nixon, Mueller has a position in which he could theoretically be fired at the behest of the President of the Ministry of Justice.</seg>
<seg id="1516">However, several senators of both parties want to prevent such a step.</seg>
<seg id="1517">Two groups of Republican and Democratic Senators presented the draft bill on Thursday, after which the special agent couldn't be dismissed as easily.</seg>
<seg id="1518">Antarctica: gigantic iceberg drives in Antarctica</seg>
<seg id="1519">In the western Antarctic, a gigantic iceberg of the scarce size of Berlin was solved by the horseshoe.</seg>
<seg id="1520">This was divided by the Bremerhavener Alfred-Wegener-Institute for Polar and Marine Research on Wednesday.</seg>
<seg id="1521">The colossal, weighing over a trillion, and 5800 square kilometres, now drifting north and will probably need two or three years until it has melted.</seg>
<seg id="1522">With a length of 175 kilometres and a width of up to 50 kilometers, it is one of the largest ice giant species that have registered in the past three decades.</seg>
<seg id="1523">There is no danger for people.</seg>
<seg id="1524">According to research data, the extent to which climate change plays a role in the demolition of the iceberg has been unclear.</seg>
<seg id="1525">However, for some 30 years there have been a series of unusual breakthroughs in the region, writes the U.S. research center for snow and ice (NSIDC) in a factual background.</seg>
<seg id="1526">According to many researchers, this could be related to global warming.</seg>
<seg id="1527">The now broken colossus has so far been part of the Larsen-C seshoe.</seg>
<seg id="1528">Schelice floats on the sea and is fed by large glaciers.</seg>
<seg id="1529">It thus continues to grow into the sea and breaks regularly.</seg>
<seg id="1530">The Larsen-C-Schelbös is located south of South America almost at the top of the Antarctic Peninsula.</seg>
<seg id="1531">North of this cowpee, the balance of waxes and abortions was disturbed some years ago.</seg>
<seg id="1532">AWI researcher Daniela Jansen writes a complete shelf file.</seg>
<seg id="1533">There is some evidence that the Larsen C sapse is in danger, as the front edge has never been so far withdrawn as at present.</seg>
<seg id="1534">In addition, the ice plate is under tension and can disintegrate if a piece abrupts at a key place.</seg>
<seg id="1535">Melting snow and iceberg does not increase sea level as they float on the water and ice as much water as it results after melting.</seg>
<seg id="1536">However, the loss of the ice shelf means that the glaciers can flow directly into the sea and can flow much faster than before.</seg>
<seg id="1537">This could potentially raise sea level, but only in a small degree, the British research project writes for the observation of Antarctica (Midas).</seg>
<seg id="1538">According to AWI, the Larsen-C chafe is the fourth largest ice shelf in the Antarctic with almost 50 000 square kilometres.</seg>
<seg id="1539">At the transition from the mainland, it is up to 700 metres thick, at the front edge to the free ocean approximately 200 meters.</seg>
<seg id="1540">There it breaks regularly.</seg>
<seg id="1541">"although it is a natural occurrence and we are not aware of any direct link to climate change, the ice shield now comes into a more dangerous position," said Martin O'Leary of the British Swansea University.</seg>
<seg id="1542">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "this is the longest retreat since the beginning of the records," "" "" "" "he also confirmed." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1543">Among scientists it is disputed whether the Larsen C Shelf will now grow back or fall back in the long term and possibly coincide, said his colleague Adrian Luckman and added: "our models say that it will be less stable."</seg>
<seg id="1544">But this development will take decades.</seg>
<seg id="1545">Even though these scientists are not leading the discontinuation of this gigantic iceberg to climate change, many of the glaciers of the Antarctic Peninsula have crumbled over the past decades.</seg>
<seg id="1546">This long top of Antarctica stretches towards South America.</seg>
<seg id="1547">According to the data of the Antarctic Survey, the Antarctic ice surface has decreased by 28 000 square kilometres since the 1950s.</seg>
<seg id="1548">The increase in temperature has contributed to the decline.</seg>
<seg id="1549">Over the last 50 years, the Antarctic Peninsula was heated by around three degrees and thus tamed to the areas where the temperature was the fastest.</seg>
<seg id="1550">CDU wants to bring Haustarif to the staff</seg>
<seg id="1551">Because it is becoming increasingly difficult to fill vacant positions, the CDU demands to withdraw from the employers "association to become more attractive.</seg>
<seg id="1552">Only shortly before the summer break, the circle-day began 41 new jobs in administration.</seg>
<seg id="1553">More than 1100 employees and officials work for the district administration in Mettmann.</seg>
<seg id="1554">Now 17 trainees have their first working day behind them.</seg>
<seg id="1555">The courses in the circle are obviously very sought-after.</seg>
<seg id="1556">Around 620 applications were registered for the places to be allocated this year.</seg>
<seg id="1557">Nevertheless, the circle is still missing in order to be able to handle the increased demands and tasks.</seg>
<seg id="1558">Currently there are still 50 non-occupied places at the Mettmann district.</seg>
<seg id="1559">Among other things, we are looking for doctors and engineers as well as forces of general administration.</seg>
<seg id="1560">The CDU wants to take the initiative together with the FDP and the UWG together with the UWG and to face the shortage of skilled workers in the administration.</seg>
<seg id="1561">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "the administration should develop a concept for personnel recruitment and personnel development according to the wish of the parties." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1562">The aim is not only to meet short-term needs of skilled workers, but to counteract the future-oriented application shortage.</seg>
<seg id="1563">The overall concept should be oriented towards the inside and the outside, show concrete measures for lateral entrants and include a training offensive, demand CDU, FDP and UWG.</seg>
<seg id="1564">That sounds like a good approach.</seg>
<seg id="1565">Because the circle has to do with personnel problems that you didn't know before.</seg>
<seg id="1566">Other cities advertise good officials and employees and offer more attractive terms.</seg>
<seg id="1567">"" "" "" "the speech is of a" "" "" "" "competition for public employers" "" "" "". "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1568">This is due to a high number of employees who excrete disease or age-related reasons from the service.</seg>
<seg id="1569">So high time to act so that no more jobs will remain unoccupied.</seg>
<seg id="1570">But Klaus-Dieter races, leader of the CDU, goes beyond the common application with his party.</seg>

<seg id="1574">With this, the CDU tries to better pay the employees and officials when it actually previews the tariff for public service.</seg>
<seg id="1575">The salaries are currently exact prescribed, increases or more money is available only if one changes to a higher level oriented towards career years.</seg>
<seg id="1576">But the tasks of the circle grew more and more in recent years.</seg>
<seg id="1577">Only a few weeks ago, new premises had to be set up in which employees take care of the provisions of the new prostitution law.</seg>
<seg id="1578">Last but not least due to the increasing number of asylum seekers, Landrat Thomas Hendele and district director Martin Richter have a problem: they have too little staff.</seg>
<seg id="1579">Italy worsens the tone on NGO migrants' rescue boats</seg>
<seg id="1580">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "Italy has warned NGOs that use lifeboats for migrants in the Mediterranean, warned that they should not continue this unless they stick to new rules for their operations." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1581">"if NGOs do not sign a new code of conduct, it is difficult to see how they can continue working," said Home Secretary Marco Minniti in an interview with the Turin daily La Stampa.</seg>
<seg id="1582">Minnitis warning came a day after the Italian authorities confiscated a boat of the German aid organisation 'Youth Rettet' because their team had worked effectively with human traffickers in a way facilitating illegal immigration.</seg>
<seg id="1583">The relief organisation, which has only been in operation for one year, refused to comment on the detailed allegations of the Italian prosecutor's Ambrogio Cartosio.</seg>
<seg id="1584">"for us, the saving of human life is our top priority. so we are very sorry that we cannot operate in the search and rescue area at the moment," said the organization in a statement on the social media.</seg>
<seg id="1585">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "we can only assess all accusations that are currently being raised after we have collected all the information and assess the situation." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1586">The Italian authorities had supervised the boat of 'Youth Rettet', the Iuventa, since October.</seg>
<seg id="1587">It is thought that the crew will ship inflatable dinghy migrants who are delivered to them directly by human traffickers, and smugglers can depart so that the ships can be used again.</seg>
<seg id="1588">At least one such meeting took place only 1.3 miles off the Libyan coast, according to the Prosecutor of the Prosecutor, whose contents were published by Italian media.</seg>
<seg id="1589">The crew is suspected of being overthrown by the authority of the Italian Coastguard, the rescue operations in the zone for humanitarian reasons and not from any other motives.</seg>
<seg id="1590">Under the Code of Conduct, boats such as the Iuventa must mainly have an Italian police officer who monitors their activities.</seg>
<seg id="1591">Only three of the nine NGOs involved in search and rescue missions have previously agreed to adhere to the code: save the Children, Moas from Malta and Pro-Activa Open Arms from Spain.</seg>
<seg id="1592">The latter said on Thursday that the new rules would be considered unnecessary, but acceptable, as they would not bring "essential changes or obstructions" to their rescue operations.</seg>
<seg id="1593">Among those who refuse to sign, the Nobel Prize winner organization Doctors Without Borders (MSF).</seg>
<seg id="1594">Minniti now said that the number of migrants who arrived in Italy after the bailout measures in Italy was greatly reduced in recent weeks, which meant that efforts to strengthen the Libyan coastguards and cooperation with local mayors have borne fruit.</seg>
<seg id="1595">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "in recent days we began to see light at the end of the tunnel," "" "" "" "said the minister." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="1597">Ascents and Trials</seg>
<seg id="1598">Nine Weilermers Biker, the "Berlin outpost" and two guest drivers met in Wachenheim in the North Palatinate for four days to enjoy Trials and sightseeings.</seg>
<seg id="1599">Three friendly guides were available for this purpose.</seg>
<seg id="1600">The accommodation in the Wachenheimer valley proved to be a good starting point for the tours.</seg>
<seg id="1601">The Burg- and Wine Festival of Wachenheim was a welcome extra.</seg>
<seg id="1602">The first tour resulted in hot summer temperatures along the vineyards to the Michaelskapelle above Deidesheim.</seg>
<seg id="1603">There followed views, partly on towers, from which one could look far over the Pfälzer Wald and the upstream plains.</seg>
<seg id="1604">In between there were again and again longer ascents, for the long trials to reward.</seg>
<seg id="1605">On the second day we went to Bad Dürkheim to the Saline and the folk festival Wurstmarkt.</seg>
<seg id="1606">Again, view point on the lookout point, connected by "flowered" triples and moderate ascents.</seg>
<seg id="1607">Over the last two days many altitude metres were announced again.</seg>
<seg id="1608">Caves, rocks, towers, castles, ruins and inroads brought welcome pauses.</seg>
<seg id="1609">In Bad Dürkheim, the bikers inhaled curative brine in the open air inhalatorium.</seg>
<seg id="1610">Neustadt was also controlled.</seg>
<seg id="1611">After 173 kilometres and almost 4500 metres altitude, the group met the Pfälzer Wald from its best side - sporty and culturally.</seg>
<seg id="1612">Console instead of grass - Bundesliga argues for e-sport</seg>
<seg id="1613">Will sports stars in the future be sitting in front of computer consoles, rather than going through the stadium-rasen with wind and weather?</seg>
<seg id="1614">Fact is: e-sports has long since become a serious business, becoming a lucrative business - big stars, millions of fans and giant tournaments with high levels.</seg>
<seg id="1615">These have also recognised the first Bundesligavereine which are increasingly engaged in this field.</seg>
<seg id="1616">The beginning of 2015 was the VfL Wolfsburg, later the FC Schalke 04 and last of the VfB Stuttgart, who founded an E-sports department in mid-July, and two professionals for the computer game FIFA 17 entered into contract.</seg>

<seg id="1621">Robin Dutt also sees great potential in the E-sport.</seg>

<seg id="1624">And: the clubs tried to conquer all sorts of markets, especially the asian ones.</seg>
<seg id="1625">With prominent e-athletes under contract, you could be much more often present on these markets online than once a year to send the federal government to Asia.</seg>
<seg id="1626">What is it all about?</seg>
<seg id="1627">At E-Sport, computer games such as "League Of Legends," "Dota 2," "Counterstrike" or the football simulation of FIFA will be fought at competitive level.</seg>
<seg id="1628">As in normal sports, Ligen has long since established itself in which professionals compete against each other.</seg>
<seg id="1629">And in the Asian Games, E-Sports is already part of the official programme.</seg>
<seg id="1630">But is it a real sport?</seg>
<seg id="1631">For many, the idea is certainly getting used to.</seg>
<seg id="1632">Ingo Fattler has also dealt with the question for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="1633">For the professor at the German Sports College in Cologne, e-sports is a sport because it is competitive and shows many biological and physical reactions, which can also be found in classical sports - for example, increased heart rates, stress reactions, hormonal changes.</seg>
<seg id="1634">It also requires cognitive skills, a technical and tactical understanding and a quick reaction.</seg>
<seg id="1635">Professional gamers should exercise not only on the console, but also their body and pay attention to the diet.</seg>
<seg id="1636">"the fit player is a good player."</seg>
<seg id="1637">"" "" "" "but it also sees problems:" "" "" "" "doping is becoming more and more a topic." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1638">Checks were difficult to carry out on online games, and in the scene the structures of classical sports were missing.</seg>
<seg id="1639">In a positive way, the scientist sets out the high integrity of the E-Sports.</seg>
<seg id="1640">The players are on the move internationally, that's like a big global family, there are no intercultural obstacles.</seg>
<seg id="1641">A study by the corporate consulting company Deloitte and the Federal Association of Interactive Entertainment software (BIU) predicts rapid growth in e-sport.</seg>

<seg id="1680">The case seems to be a legal precedent since there is no law in Massachusetts that makes it a crime to urge someone to commit suicide.</seg>
<seg id="1681">Carter was 17 years old when Roy was found dead in 2014 by a carbon monoxide poisoning in a vehicle.</seg>
<seg id="1682">The case attracted national attention after Carters revealed text messages that she encouraged him to end his life.</seg>
<seg id="1683">"hang on, spring from a building, get yourself, I don't know there are many ways," she said in several messages she had sent in the two weeks before his death while he was on vacation with his family.</seg>
<seg id="1684">In the moments before his suicide, she wrote: "you must do it, Conrad" and "Everything you have to do is turn on the generator and you will be free and happy."</seg>
<seg id="1685">Judge Moniz said that Carter's attention was sought by Roy's death and ordered that they should benefit from any press from the case.</seg>
<seg id="1686">The case has shared the legal opinion.</seg>

<seg id="1725">Company content with Rhineland-Palatinate Minister: economy praises Wisconian pace</seg>
<seg id="1726">It was often irreconcilable, the relationship between the country and the regional economy, when Eveline Lemke (Green) was still Minister of Economic Affairs of Rhineland-Palatinate.</seg>
<seg id="1727">This shows after more than a year in which the new Minister of Economy Volker Wissing (FDP) is in office.</seg>
<seg id="1728">Chambers and companies from the region talk about a shift in economic policy on T V-demand - and at the same time blame the old ministers.</seg>
<seg id="1729">Frank natus, Chairman of the Association of Trier companies (VTU), says: "Wissing attacks the wishes of the economy, which Lemke has all blocked."</seg>
<seg id="1730">Natus in the infrastructural policy: the gap between Kelberg and Adenau is now at the top of the priority list of the country.</seg>
<seg id="1731">This year, the ministry hopes for a planning process, until 2021 will be the right to construction.</seg>
<seg id="1732">A role in the plans of the country is also played by the Westumgehung Trier, which is in the urgent need of the federal transport network.</seg>
<seg id="1733">The aim is to put the route into operation in December 2020, says Ministerial Speaker Cornelia Holtmann.</seg>
<seg id="1734">Of course, natus sees in it a signpost to support regional, but internationally competing companies.</seg>
<seg id="1735">The Chamber of Industry and Commerce (IHK) Trier aims, as expected by Wissing, in the wine of a Rhineland-Palatinate-label to increase sales in supermarkets and to stop the trend of the German wine exports falling for ten years.</seg>
<seg id="1736">In addition, Wissing has an open ear for people who want to establish their own company lobbies.</seg>
<seg id="1737">The Craftsmen Chamber of Trier provides an additional incentive for young apprentices in the new master bonus, says managing director Matthias Schwalbach.</seg>
<seg id="1738">A premium of 1000 Euro is provided for the passing master exam and 2500 euros if graduates do their own on their own within ten years after the master's training.</seg>
<seg id="1739">But the homework list for the country remains long.</seg>
<seg id="1740">The planned road construction is quick to provide facts, and at the same time the country lacks the necessary personnel, says Jan Glockauer, chief executive of the Chamber of Commerce of the Chamber of Commerce of Trier.</seg>
<seg id="1741">Of 56 new engineers who want to employ Wissing in the state-run mobility, only 29 jobs have been occupied until now.</seg>
<seg id="1742">The Chamber calls for more orders to be awarded to external offices.</seg>
<seg id="1743">S & D vice-president Christian Baldauf refers to calculations of the Court of Auditors, the country has invested more than 20 million euros less in the receipt of country roads by 2017 and 2018.</seg>
<seg id="1744">In addition, Frank natus also expects the country's concept of how to remedy the shortage of skilled workers in the region.</seg>
<seg id="1745">Furthermore, the existing broadband expansion in the country is sobering.</seg>
<seg id="1746">In 2016, regional companies evaluated net supply in an IHK survey only with a rating of 3.4.</seg>
<seg id="1747">They complained about increasing internet connections and outbreaks.</seg>
<seg id="1748">On the other hand, ex-business minister Eveline Lemke is out of politics at the moment and is still sitting in the supervisory board of the wind power company Pro Wind.</seg>
<seg id="1749">The Green Group left Lemke in April to become president of a private university in Karlsruhe, where after four months they already cleared the field for inconsistencies.</seg>
<seg id="1750">Audi is expected to change 850,000 diesel vehicles - car manufacturers face a counter reaction</seg>
<seg id="1751">One day before the announcement of Audi, BMW said it would offer to update the software in more than 350,000 vehicles.</seg>
<seg id="1752">The BMW president said the company believes that "there are more intelligent options than driving limitations," and thus referring to European cities - including Munich, where BMW is based - to ban or limit diesel vehicles.</seg>
<seg id="1753">Daimler announced on Tuesday that it will modify three million Mercedes vehicles in Europe to reduce its diesel emissions.</seg>
<seg id="1754">None of the companies described the enterprises as a recall.</seg>
<seg id="1755">European automakers have strongly encouraged the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States to support compliance with rules on carbon dioxide emissions.</seg>
<seg id="1756">But the nitrogen oxides that emit diesel engines are considered carcinogens and may cause asthma.</seg>
<seg id="1757">The cost of the car manufacturers to install facilities for neutralizing exhaust fumes from diesel vehicles also increase, making it difficult to keep the price of cars competitive.</seg>
<seg id="1758">German Chancellor Angela Merkel is also accused of wasting powerful car companies and ignoring the signs of the problem.</seg>
<seg id="1759">Companies try to avoid the failure of Volkswagen, which could regulate the use of so-called launcher equipment that could regulate emissions to comply with the regulations when a car was tested, but driving back under normal driving conditions.</seg>
<seg id="1760">In the United States, several Volkswagen employees were charged; others were examined on both sides of the Atlantic.</seg>
<seg id="1761">Last month, the former head of thermodynamics was arrested in the engine development of Audi in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="1762">The former manager, Zaccheo Giovanni Pamio, is an Italian and is therefore not protected from extradition and could be put in court in the United States.</seg>
<seg id="1763">At the beginning of this year, Audi was involved in German criminal investigations in Volkswagen after the authorities accusing Audi to have installed a system to circumvent emissions legislation in Europe, and a request focused on the United States has been expanded.</seg>
<seg id="1764">The inclusion of Audi into the investigation could weigh heavily on Volkswagen: the luxury car manufacturer contributed disproportionately to Volkswagen's profit.</seg>

<seg id="1777">From time to time, Mordillo was one of the most popular cartoonist draftsmen, the bollennes of his characters are his trademark.</seg>

<seg id="1780">Guillermo Mordillo was born on 4 August 1932 as a son of Spanish immigrants in Buenos Aires.</seg>
<seg id="1781">In the first years as an artist he distinguished himself among other things as a sign of greeting cards - which frustrated him.</seg>
<seg id="1782">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "the happiest day in my professional life was the day when I lost my job," "" "" "" "he once said." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1783">After stops in Lima, New York and Paris he made a breakthrough at the end of the 1960s: with the publication of his cartoons in "Paris Match," and then also in the "Star" and other leading magazines around the world.</seg>
<seg id="1784">Even in China, Mordillo found many fans.</seg>
<seg id="1785">Again and again the artist was inspired by cities.</seg>
<seg id="1786">Large, roundish Mordillo figures cavort in drawings with the Leaning Tower of Pisa, Big Ben in London and the Red Square in Moscow.</seg>

<seg id="1795">Lavender from Provence threatened by climate change</seg>
<seg id="1796">He has become a symbol of Provence in the South of France, but there is a warning that he is threatened with climate change.</seg>
<seg id="1797">The lavender is decreasing due to the conditions that are reminiscent of drought and due to disease-transmitting insects, which causes scientists and farmers who try to find solutions, causing great headaches.</seg>
<seg id="1798">Eric Chaisse, expert of the agricultural research institute CRIEPPAM in Provence, said: "the lavender in Provence is effectively endangered because the plant has been exposed to the effects of climate change in recent years, which brought much less rain in the spring and much more in autumn.</seg>
<seg id="1799">This has an impact on the lifespan of lavender.</seg>
<seg id="1800">There is also a small zikade, a microbacterium that transfers dwarf cicadas, and in very dry weather there are many of them. "</seg>
<seg id="1801">And there is much in the game.</seg>
<seg id="1802">Lavender oil not only attracts tourists, it is also very popular for perfume and cosmetics.</seg>
<seg id="1803">"" "" "" "Eric Chaisse said:" "" "" "" "instead of having very long plant ears with a large number of flowers, we have minor, underdeveloped and either missing or weakened." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1804">So we have fewer parts with essential oil. "</seg>
<seg id="1805">The solutions that are considered include a better water distribution and the slowdown of evaporation from the soil, but also the spraying of plants with a protective blend of clay and water and the development of varieties that are more resistant to drought.</seg>

<seg id="1809">The assassination of a journalist underlines the growing threat in Mexico</seg>
<seg id="1810">The employees of the weekly paper Riodoce normally meet Wednesday to review their plans for reporting on the recent chaos in the state of Sinaloa by organised crime, corrupt officials and incessant drug wars.</seg>
<seg id="1811">But on that day, in the shadow of their own tragedy, they came together to talk about security.</seg>
<seg id="1812">They were told that it is important to change their routines.</seg>
<seg id="1813">Two high-ranking journalists discuss what feels more secure: they should take their children to the office, which were the target of an attack with grenades in 2009, or leave them at home.</seg>
<seg id="1814">Security experts have written three words on a table at the front of the room: opponents, Neutral, Allies.</seg>
<seg id="1815">They ask the reporters to suggest names for each column - no evidence is necessary, perceptions and gut feelings suffice.</seg>
<seg id="1816">There are drug smugglers, politicians, businessmen, journalists who are suspected of standing on the payroll of the government or cartels, a catalogue of criminals who make the chaos of Mexico dangerous.</seg>
<seg id="1817">There is no break from violence, and while in the whole country the corpses are piled up, more and more journalists are there: at least 25 since President Enrique Pena Nieto took office in December 2012. 589 are under federal protection after attacks and threats and until now there have been at least seven deaths in seven countries this year.</seg>
<seg id="1818">Among the latter is her editor and her inspirer of Riodoce, co-founder Javier Valdez Cardenas.</seg>
<seg id="1819">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "the biggest mistake is to live in Mexico and be a journalist," "" "" "" "Valdez wrote in one of his numerous books on violence related to drugs." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1820">His absence is felt deep, although his presence is everywhere - a large photo of Valdez, showing his middle finger with the word "Justice," hangs on the facade of the Riodoce building. two reporters in the thirties, Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez, wear t-shirts which show his smiling face with glasses or his typical Panamahut.</seg>
<seg id="1821">The workshop takes place less than two months after his death, and the reporters discuss their shared topics, the trauma, their nightmares, sleeplessness, paranoia.</seg>
<seg id="1822">Although a special Federal Attorney General was established in 2010 to deal with the cases of journalists, only two criminal proceedings were initiated by the Committee on the Protection of Journalists.</seg>
<seg id="1823">As with most thousands of murders, which are associated with drug trafficking and organised crime every year, journalists are rarely indicted by journalists.</seg>
<seg id="1824">At Riodoce, they still insist on treating the violence of Sinaloa although they are uncomforting and although the terrain is now more treacherous.</seg>
<seg id="1825">Without information about murderers, without justice, the meeting to discuss safety has little benefit, says Ibarra.</seg>
<seg id="1826">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "it is very stupid to waste my time in this workshop," "" "" "" "he says." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1827">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "as long as we don't know the" "" "" "" "why, we all mistrust everybody." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1828">On the morning of 15 May Valdez left the office of the newspaper Riodoce in the capital of Culiacan.</seg>
<seg id="1829">He managed to drive a few blocks far before his red Toyota Corolla was stopped by two men. he was forced out of his car and 12 times was shot on him, probably because of the name of the newspaper, which is translated with "Twelfth River."</seg>
<seg id="1830">The shooter drove away in his car and damaged it nearby.</seg>
<seg id="1831">Valdez was 50 years old.</seg>
<seg id="1832">He left a woman and two grown-up children.</seg>
<seg id="1833">Rumors tend to fly freely in Culiacan.</seg>
<seg id="1834">But on the subject of Valdez there is practically nothing but silence.</seg>
<seg id="1835">Since Guzman's arrest last year and extradition to the United States in January, Sinaloa became one of the bloodiest battlefields in the country, as rival factions fight here to fill the vacuum.</seg>
<seg id="1836">It doesn't matter that in Sinaloa every day someone or several people are shot on the street or that the cemetery is full of decorated, two-story mouse mosques for drug kings that are larger than many homes for the living.</seg>
<seg id="1837">Forget for a minute that there is a state of "rest" when only a cartel has control of the coastal state with its valuable ports and drug trade routes in the United States.</seg>
<seg id="1838">Nevertheless and despite the fact that Valdez was aware of the dangers of his work, Ismail Bojorquez (60), a co-founder and director of Riodoce, was broken with the blame that he could not protect his friend.</seg>
<seg id="1839">He believes that two misunderstandings have contributed to the murder.</seg>
<seg id="1840">At first there was the publication of an interview with Damascus Lopez, a leader of one of the rival cartel fractions in the war with Guzman's sons.</seg>
<seg id="1841">This publication may annoy the sons, suspected side members bought each copy of the issue as soon as they were delivered to newspaper kiosks.</seg>
<seg id="1842">The second mistake was that Valdez did not force him to leave the country for his own security after the seizure of another newspaper, which had published the same story.</seg>
<seg id="1843">Valdez was a legend in Mexico and abroad, and his killing is considered a milestone in Mexican violence against journalists.</seg>
<seg id="1844">He had survived so long that his friends and colleagues assumed that he would always be there.</seg>
<seg id="1845">He worked as an experienced journalist for Noroeste in 2003 when he joined five colleagues in the founding of Riodoce and sold 50 US dollar holdings.</seg>
<seg id="1846">"" "" "" "in Sinaloa," "" "" "" "it was impossible to run journalism without encountering the toxicity problem," "" "" "" "said Bojorquez." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1847">Over time, the newspaper has earned a reputation for courageous and honest reporting, and sales and advertising increased.</seg>
<seg id="1848">Reporters loved to be able to publish hard-fitting investigations without fear of censorship, and readers were fascinated by a publication where they could read stories that no one else dared to treat.</seg>
<seg id="1849">Eight years after the founding of Riodoce, she received the prestigious "Maria-Moors-Cabot Award" for her coverage in Latin America.</seg>
<seg id="1850">In the same year, Valdez gained the 'International Press Freedom Award' of the Committee for the Protection of Journalists for his courage in the persecution of Mexican drug history, wherever it led.</seg>
<seg id="1851">He volunteered to be afraid.</seg>
<seg id="1852">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "I want to continue living," "" "" "" "he said at the time of the CPJ award." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1853">"" "" "" "drug trafficking in Sinaloa" "" "" "" "is a way of life," "" "" "" "he said last October in an interview with Rompeviento-TV." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1854">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "you have to take the task that you as a journalist - either that or you play the dumb." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1855">"" "" "" "I don't want to be asked:" "" "" "" "what did you do in view of so many dead... why didn't you say what was going on?" "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1856">The Riodocice team missed Valdez, the fun bird that could escape like a dockworker, a friend who was generous with hugs and advice, a teacher who knew how to survive.</seg>
<seg id="1857">They trusted in his routine.</seg>
<seg id="1858">He would always wear his hat.</seg>
<seg id="1859">He would always go to El Guayabo, the bar opposite the office, and there always sit at the same table.</seg>
<seg id="1860">Now they ask: was his love for routine his ruin?</seg>
<seg id="1861">His death also forced them to question their own assumptions about how they can best do their work and stay alive.</seg>
<seg id="1862">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "they don't like it when you deal with their women, their children, their clean stores, their secret start and runways," "" "" "" "for drugs." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1863">"these things were not allowed," said Bojorquez.</seg>
<seg id="1864">The result is, even in the best times, a high degree of self-censorship and self-preservation.</seg>
<seg id="1865">Trust his own instincts.</seg>
<seg id="1866">If it smells wrong, stay away from it.</seg>
<seg id="1867">The trouble is, the editor of the Riodoce Andres Villarreal said that "smell is a sense that can be fooled... and then the thing happened to Javier."</seg>
<seg id="1868">The old rules, as he and others say, are no longer valid in Sinaloa - just as in Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Guerrero and other states in which a poisonous mix of lucrative smuggling routes, weak institutions and corrupt government officials are at home.</seg>
<seg id="1869">The landscape changes constantly.</seg>
<seg id="1870">In the room where the staff of Riodoce met for safety training, suddenly no mobile phones were allowed. days before was known that Spyware, which is sold exclusively to governments, was used to monitor journalists and activists in Mexico.</seg>
<seg id="1871">Outside, two policemen were looking for protection from the heat of 104 degrees (40 ° C) in the shade of a tree.</seg>
<seg id="1872">They were commissioned by the provincial government to protect the offices of Riodoce in a four-story building in a mid-size quarter of Culiacan.</seg>
<seg id="1873">Half in the joke, some of the reporters asked themselves whether these officers were among the 50 percent of the police officers who were not trustworthy by the Governor himself.</seg>
<seg id="1874">It is months since the reporters went to the mountain landscape where drug gangs are de facto under control.</seg>
<seg id="1875">For the issue of this week, Riodoce has rested on three main stories.</seg>
<seg id="1876">There was the murder of the brother of the former well-known speaker Julio Cesar Chavez in Sinaloa.</seg>
<seg id="1877">They also had an exposure to state expenditures focused on the home town of the governor.</seg>
<seg id="1878">And there was a group in one of the most expensive restaurants in Culiacan, a block away from the Office of the Prosecutor, leading a kidnapping.</seg>
<seg id="1879">There was no official word about who was kidnapped or how it happened, so be careful when it was time to write what everyone in the city knows that the restaurant is a favorite local of drug dealers and authorities.</seg>
<seg id="1880">A reporter learned from public records that the restaurant was registered under the name of a politician who belonged to the ruling Institutional Revolution Party (PRI), which reigned almost all the century all the political planes.</seg>
<seg id="1881">Recently several PRI governors were accused of high-profile cases of corruption.</seg>
<seg id="1882">Villarreal asked the reporter to write about previous events in this restaurant, including one in which a son of "El Chapo" Guzman escaped a military assault.</seg>
<seg id="1883">Only a few months earlier, readers would have considered the column of Valdez as the best informed source about kidnapping.</seg>
<seg id="1884">"in the past we had known what happened," said Villarreal, 46, with the nickname "El Flaco" because of his slender body stature.</seg>
<seg id="1885">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "now all communication channels are broken with our sources." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1886">The Valdez office became a storage room for signs and stickers protesting against the killings of journalists, because the employees had become something they had never expected: activists in the name of the press.</seg>
<seg id="1887">Reporter Miriam Ramirez took a few signs and went to the office of the prosecutor the next morning for a demonstration because of another journalist.</seg>
<seg id="1888">Salvador Adame disappeared three days after Valdez was killed in the western state of Michoacan.</seg>
<seg id="1889">A burnt body was discovered and officials say based on DNA tests that it is its.</seg>
<seg id="1890">Throughout the country, journalists have become louder by writing down "SOS Press" protests and constructions in organized protests.</seg>
<seg id="1891">On that day, the director Bojorquez is away in Washington and tries to collect international support for justice in the Valdez case.</seg>
<seg id="1892">At a meeting with the governor of Sinaloa on the day after the murder of Valdez, Ramirez accused the authorities to spy on journalists and kill them because they told the truth.</seg>
<seg id="1893">She has since asked her to be re-subdivided by the government because she is worried that her anger violated her objectivity.</seg>
<seg id="1894">"" "" "" "Valdez said repeatedly that journalists are" "" "" "" "surrounded by organised crime, government officials and a consistent society." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1895">In his last book, "Narco-Journalism," he wrote that reporters are not only killed by drug gangs, but also on the command of politicians and security forces who were under a blanket with organised crime.</seg>
<seg id="1896">Last year, the media group "Articulo 19" assigned more than half of the attacks to journalists of the police and officials.</seg>
<seg id="1897">"in Mexico you die because they want you to keep your mouth," said Ramirez.</seg>
<seg id="1898">Obviously, the murders have a deterrent effect.</seg>
<seg id="1899">Nobody forgets the death of the blogger Maria Elizabeth Macias in the northern border state of Tamaulipas six years ago.</seg>
<seg id="1900">Your body was found together with a note signed by the Zetas cartel: "here I am because of my reports."</seg>
<seg id="1901">A computer keyboard and headphones were located next to their separate head.</seg>
<seg id="1902">Some branches have chosen to close, like the newspaper El Norte in the northern border state of Chihuahua after the murder of correspondent Miroslava Breach in March.</seg>
<seg id="1903">Others continue as El Manana did from Nuevo Laredo after the assassination of its director in 2004.</seg>
<seg id="1904">In 2010, the Diario de Ciudad Juarez publicly addressed the drug cartels with an editorial on the title page with the title "What do you want from us?"</seg>
<seg id="1905">Some journalists have fled their home countries or even from the country.</seg>
<seg id="1906">It is a painful decision.</seg>
<seg id="1907">It is hard to find work in exile, and they still watch the streets and look for dangers.</seg>

<seg id="1926">The report in Current Biology described him as "the best-preserved dinosaur who has ever been found, and one of the best dinosaur copies in the world."</seg>
<seg id="1927">The fossil is a newly discovered species of nodosaurs, living in the middle of the chalk time between 110 million and 112 million years.</seg>
<seg id="1928">His unbelievably well-preserved state has astonished scientists who describe it as "truly remarkable."</seg>
<seg id="1929">According to reports in National Geographic, the armored plant eater is the best preserved fossil of its kind.</seg>
<seg id="1930">It was found by Shawn Funk, when he dug in the Suncor Millenium mine near Fort McMurray in the north of Alberta, Canada.</seg>
<seg id="1931">He met something that seemed out of place of the surrounding rock, and decided to look more closely.</seg>
<seg id="1932">The fossil discovered by him was sent to the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Paleontology.</seg>
<seg id="1933">They spent the next six years discovering the wild animal within the 2,500 pounds (1,100 kg) heavy earthenware.</seg>
<seg id="1934">After all this hard work, the finished result is now ready to be revealed.</seg>
<seg id="1935">"if you only smile a little with your eyes, you could almost believe that it slept," said the main author Caleb Brown, scientist at the Royal Tyrrell Museum, where the creature is to be seen.</seg>
<seg id="1936">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "it will enter the history of science as one of the most beautiful and best preserved dinosaur copies - the Mona Lisa of the dinosaur." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1937">Researchers have found that this herbivorous, even though it is covered with a armor and resembles a changing tank, is probably threatened by carnivorous dinosaurs.</seg>
<seg id="1938">The heavily armoured dinosaur used a red and white camouflage to hide from predators, and used a shielding technique known as counter-shading, which is also used by many modern animals.</seg>
<seg id="1939">This would have allowed to better blend into its surroundings and to avoid its enemies, experts say, suggesting that it was threatened by larger dinosaurs.</seg>
<seg id="1940">The 110 million year old creature from the Nodosaurier family has made headlines for the first time in May and is now available at the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Palaeontology.</seg>
<seg id="1941">Researchers have now studied the wild animal and called it Borealopelta marsuchelli after the museum engineer Mark Mitchell, one of a team that spent more than 7,000 hours with it carefully.</seg>
<seg id="1942">The astonishing preservation of the specimen made it possible for Dr. Mitchell and an international team of scientists to document the pattern and form of scales and armor over his body.</seg>
<seg id="1943">They discovered the counter shading, a widespread defence method in the animal kingdom, which means that the tip of the creature was darker than its underside.</seg>
<seg id="1944">Although the counter shading is common, the results are surprising as the size of Borealopelta by far exceeds the animals living today.</seg>
<seg id="1945">It indicates that the dinosaur was hunted by dinosaurs of sufficient pressure by carnivorous dinosaurs, that evolution favoured the concealment of the confrontation as a means of survival.</seg>
<seg id="1946">But most contemporary animals that use counter shading - think of deer, zebras or shingles - are much smaller and more vulnerable than prey, which indicates that this Nodosaurier was a real battle for survival.</seg>
<seg id="1947">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "strong predator behavior on a massive, heavily armoured dinosaur show how dangerous the dinosaurs predators of the chalk time must have been," "" "" "" "said Brown." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1948">The chemical analysis of organic compounds in their scales also shows that the skin of the dinosaur was bay.</seg>
<seg id="1949">Scientists continue to study the animal on indications of his life, including his preserved bowel content to find out what he ate as his last meal.</seg>
<seg id="1950">They believe that the dinosaur, when he died, got into a river and was driven out into the sea, where he fell on his back to the bottom of the sea.</seg>
<seg id="1951">At that time Alberta was as warm as South-fluorida today, and rivers and oceans are likely far more inland than they are today.</seg>
<seg id="1952">"this Nodosaurier is really remarkable because it is completely covered with preserved scaly skin, but remains intact in three dimensions and retains the original shape of the animal," said Brown.</seg>
<seg id="1953">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "the result is that today the animal looks almost the same as in the early chalk time." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1954">You don't need much imagination to reconstruct it. if you just have a little with your eyes, you could almost believe that it is sleeping. "</seg>
<seg id="1955">The Cretaceous period was a time when huge theropods, carnivorous dinosaurs standing on two legs crossed the earth.</seg>
<seg id="1956">Although the king of them, the Tyrannosaurus Rex, lived millions of years after Borealopelta, the armored dinosaur was hunted by some of his terrifying ancestors.</seg>
<seg id="1957">This belongs to the Acrocanthosaurus, a 38 foot (11.5 m) long, six tons of heavy monsters.</seg>
<seg id="1958">The scientists, whose latest findings appear in Current Biology, believe that Borealopelta sank after death in the sea and was mumified in the mud.</seg>
<seg id="1959">The creature was found by Shawn Funk, when he dug in the Suncor Millenium mine near Fort McMurray in the north of Alberta, Canada, on 21 March 2011.</seg>
<seg id="1960">According to the museum, it is the best preserved dinosaur of the world, including skin and armor, and is completely from the muzzle to the hip.</seg>
<seg id="1961">The creatures on average were about 18 feet long and have weighed up to 3,000 pounds (1,300 kg).</seg>
<seg id="1962">It contained two 20-inch long spikes that were protruding from his shoulders.</seg>
<seg id="1963">The researchers believe that the armored herbivorous was swept through the western Canada until a flooded river flooded into the open sea.</seg>
<seg id="1964">But the aquatic cremation of the dinosaur kept its armor in exquisite detail.</seg>
<seg id="1965">The petrified remains of this special specimen are preserved so well that the doorstep still lay bumpy armoured plates along the dinosaur</seg>
<seg id="1966">As Michael Greshko wrote for National Geographic, such a level of conservation is so rare as a win in the lottery.</seg>
<seg id="1967">The more I approach it, the more confusing it becomes.</seg>
<seg id="1968">Clogged remains of the skin still cover the bumpy armoured plates that carry the skull of the animal.</seg>
<seg id="1969">His right front foot rests on his side, his five fingers are spread upward.</seg>
<seg id="1970">I can count the scales at his sole '.</seg>

<seg id="1986">Deutsche Bahn: company tests "comfort check-in"</seg>
<seg id="1987">It is a moment that almost everyone has experienced before: nothing surprising is sitting in the train and sleeping.</seg>
<seg id="1988">Or one is deepened in his work and has just a brilliant mind.</seg>
<seg id="1989">And then: bufff.</seg>

<seg id="1992">But the times of interruptions are soon gone.</seg>
<seg id="1993">The Deutsche Bahn is currently testing the free ticket control.</seg>
<seg id="1994">It is simply confirmed by a mobile phone that you take your seat and devaluate the ticket.</seg>
<seg id="1995">A test operation is currently running on two tracks.</seg>

<seg id="1998">"comfort Check-in" calls the railway ticket devaluation without sheepskin.</seg>
<seg id="1999">To be able to use them, however, some requirements must be met: you need a smartphone or tablet.</seg>
<seg id="2000">And you have to book an online ticket - what most passengers do anyway.</seg>
<seg id="2001">It is also necessary to have purchased the DB navigator app, which is the most convenient type of ticket booking anyway.</seg>
<seg id="2002">And last but not least you need a seat reservation.</seg>
<seg id="2003">Because the "comfort check-in" works like this: one gets into the train, calling out his ticket to "My Tickets."</seg>
<seg id="2004">A button for the electronic devaluation appears with the test customers.</seg>
<seg id="2005">The train attendants get a message on their mobile devices that passenger X is on the train and has taken the booked seat Y.</seg>
<seg id="2006">If the train attendant arrives at number Y at the ticket inspection, he knows that a passenger sits there with already devalued online ticket.</seg>
<seg id="2007">So you can continue to sleep, continue working, keep silent.</seg>
<seg id="2008">The "check-in" has two advantages: one for the customer, one for the train - which in turn should be used by passengers.</seg>
<seg id="2009">"if you want to travel relaxed without ticket inspection by our train attendant, you simply check in in the DB navigator yourself.</seg>

<seg id="2012">Those who often drive train know that in addition to delays and missed trains, ticket inspections are one of the biggest offences.</seg>
<seg id="2013">Because often you do not have all the documents you need for the validation of online tickets in any case.</seg>
<seg id="2014">Either the credit card or identity card is missing or a document that must be presented.</seg>
<seg id="2015">The result is endless discussions between train attendants and passenger, which leads to a bad mood in the section or large room and delays in controlling one's own ticket and taking the conductor at the end time to take care of other matters.</seg>
<seg id="2016">Only a small number of test customers can use the new service.</seg>
<seg id="2017">And that's only on the ICE 915 Dortmund-Stuttgart connections and ICE 912 Stuttgart-Essen.</seg>

<seg id="2020">On 9 August 2014 Brittany Ferrell was shaken to its core.</seg>
<seg id="2021">Just one day after she arrived in New York City, the St. Louis Bride sat on the bed of an Airbnb flat she rented and scrolls through Facebook on her phone.</seg>
<seg id="2022">She stumbled over a post by someone from high school.</seg>
<seg id="2023">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "the police have just killed a 18-year-old child and it's still on the road," "" "" "" "she said there." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2024">Confused as nobody else posted the information on her feed, she closed Facebook and opened Twitter.</seg>
<seg id="2025">A user with the Handle @ theePharoah was constantly rescued at their timeline.</seg>
<seg id="2026">The rapper from the area of St. Louis was involved in tweeting the death of Michael Brown, an unarmed Black 18-year-old who was killed by a white police officer in Ferguson, Mo.</seg>
<seg id="2027">He posted a picture of Brown's lifeless body that was stretched out on the street and would stay there for four hours.</seg>
<seg id="2028">"that's wild," Ferrell thought with them.</seg>
<seg id="2029">But death was nothing new for them and their community.</seg>
<seg id="2030">She put her cell phone off to return later in the evening to tweets about people on the Canfield-Drive.</seg>
<seg id="2031">There were photos of the police band and people crying, and from a man who claimed to be Brown's father who wore a sign with the inscription: "Ferguson police has just killed my unarmed son!"</seg>
<seg id="2032">She watched a live feed where a policeman stood in front of a group of demonstrators with a barking dog.</seg>
<seg id="2033">In another video, she said, another policeman delivered his rifle and cried: "I will kill you... animals all."</seg>
<seg id="2034">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "this is not common," "" "" "" "Ferrell recalled her statement." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2035">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "this is not the kind of murder we have become accustomed to and which we can name typical." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2036">At that moment I felt chills.</seg>
<seg id="2037">"" "" "" "I was angry and wept." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2038">She booked a return flight and went home the next day.</seg>
<seg id="2039">After the landing at 23 o'clock, she took her 6-year-old daughter from her father's house and decided that the two would go to Ferguson the next morning.</seg>
<seg id="2040">What happened in the next three years with Ferrell and Ferguson is the subject of a new documentary film, "Whose Streets?," in the cinemas from the 11.</seg>
<seg id="2041">It is a story of survival and protest, love and loss, strength and resilience that exists from the viewpoint of the people who live in the community and have filled the streets to demand answers.</seg>
<seg id="2042">When Ferrell spoke to Ferguson with her daughter, who carried a flower-dress and a matching crown, the two had a conversation, which they had countless times before this morning "about the black experience and the black state."</seg>
<seg id="2043">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "you remember how I have taught you when black people have to fight for what they believe?" "" "" "" "she remembered what she said." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="2046">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "what has happened today is a highlight of what happened in the past." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2047">It must know and see it and be drawn up in it.</seg>
<seg id="2048">It must be well developed, not just activism and organization, but also the various layers of black experience and the black constitution and what we must do to become free to free ourselves.</seg>
<seg id="2049">Even if I am lucky enough to give her an experience in which she personally experiences no blatant racism, she is no different from the next black women child.</seg>
<seg id="2050">"" "" "" "I feel I would show you a bad service to keep them away." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2051">The first station when they arrived in Ferguson was on South Florissant Road, a place opposite the police authority, which became a camp area when the activists were waiting for the possible non-accusation of Officer Darren Wilson.</seg>
<seg id="2052">There, Ferrell and her daughter joined with a local owner who made lunch.</seg>
<seg id="2053">They prepared bags and helped to pass them on to demonstrators.</seg>
<seg id="2054">Slowly a new kind of activism began to take shape for Ferrell.</seg>
<seg id="2055">"my activism changed totally after August 9," she said, and noticed that she was a student at the University of Missouri-St. Louis, President of the Minority Student Nurses Association and focused on eating justice and health inequalities in black communes.</seg>
<seg id="2056">"I had no experience in organising.</seg>
<seg id="2057">Everything has come. "</seg>
<seg id="2058">Weeks later, during an evening demonstration, Ferrell met Sabaah Folayan, one of the co-directors of the film.</seg>

<seg id="2060">"" "" "" "one question came Ferrell in mind:" "" "" "" "do you want to document or try to find a story you can take advantage of?" "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2061">This skepticism was nourished by countless cases of people, often by whites - in a community that benefited from their pain and resilience.</seg>
<seg id="2062">As Folayan recently stated in an interview, "We had heard that people born and raised in Ferguson did not centre their voices and we wanted to do it differently."</seg>
<seg id="2063">Folayan had already worked with the co-director Damon Davis, an artist from the area known for his activism around Todestraked inmates.</seg>
<seg id="2064">His engagement brought Ferrell closer to the project, along with six other local people, the team of "Whose Streets" followed in the years after Browning's shooting.</seg>
<seg id="2065">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "this documentary is not someone who speaks for us or speaks to us. we're talking," "" "" "" "said Davis." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="2067">The goal was not to focus on Ferris's experience - to show that the movement "is not a Messiah leader, but rather a community that comes together," said Folayan - it proved to be the most open participant in the film.</seg>
<seg id="2068">As a result, documents of "Whose Streets" show surprising personal aspects of Ferris's life, as she falls in love with and marries her wife.</seg>
<seg id="2069">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "I felt like naked," "" "" "" "said Ferrell and laughed when she saw the finished product for the first time." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2070">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "but I have understood that there must be a certain vulnerability in this work and for the dehumanisation of black people." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2071">In addition, Ferris's story repeats the role of black gay women in the wider Black-Lives-Matter movement.</seg>
<seg id="2072">Two of the three founders of the movement, who have shaped the film "Blackout Matter" in social media after the killing of the black teenager Trayby Martin in 2012, can be identified as gay.</seg>
<seg id="2073">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "black, gay women in leadership positions have worn the movement altogether," "" "" "" "said Ferrell," "" "" "" "and so we are constantly fighting on different fronts." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="2075">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "Folayan agreed to notice that" "" "" "" "the movement is really maintained by black women and many black women." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2076">But it insists that "this is not an affirmative type of action," in which Ferrell was selected as the heart of the film on the basis of her identity.</seg>

<seg id="2081">Ferrell is on parole for 2 ½ years because of the blocking of a highway in a demonstration.</seg>
<seg id="2082">She describes the socio-political atmosphere of the area she calls her home: "chaos."</seg>

<seg id="2088">From "Dream" to "megalomania": TV readers discuss bit-gallery</seg>
<seg id="2089">The bit gallery moves people even though it hasn't been built for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="2090">But the idea of a shopping centre at the southern end of the pedestrian zone has since the first presentation in 2009 splits the population into advocates and opponents.</seg>
<seg id="2091">The theme is hardly cold.</seg>
<seg id="2092">The topic is also discussed on our Facebook page "Volksfreund Bitburg."</seg>
<seg id="2093">While one speaks to the Bit Gallery: "that would be a dream" (Anja Becker) or "That would be really great" (Nicole Schausten), comes from the other side: "no man needs" (Siggi Betzen) or quite simply: "megalomania!" (Lars Scholz).</seg>
<seg id="2094">While the advocates build a gallery to attract more customers to the city, of which the rest of the shops also profit, the opponents fear that the pedestrian zone will then bleed out.</seg>
<seg id="2095">In addition, the gallery is planned exactly on the property on which the farmers market hall is located in which 13 direct marketing products offer their products.</seg>
<seg id="2096">At the beginning of the construction work will be concluded.</seg>
<seg id="2097">The gallery-makers want to integrate a market hall into the new building - to Beda-Platz with possibility to sit outside.</seg>
<seg id="2098">"" "" "" "Simone Room:" "" "" "" "we have been shopping in the peasant market for many years now." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2099">Mainly our eggs, but also the delicious cakes of the farm women always happy again.</seg>
<seg id="2100">We also discovered the butcher's shop for us.</seg>
<seg id="2101">We would like to wish that even during and above all, after the construction of the gallery there is a chance to maintain this offer.</seg>
<seg id="2102">In other cities there is also.</seg>
<seg id="2103">Especially the Kleinmarkthalle in Frankfurt is interesting. "</seg>
<seg id="2104">Gerd Densing: "whether direct marketing in a market hall in the gallery resides, depends on the amount of rent.</seg>
<seg id="2105">"" "" "" "but this should probably not be very low in the new project." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2106">Eva Kilic: "what is the shopping centre in Bitburg?</seg>
<seg id="2107">Whether clothing, shoes, drugstores or supermarkets: I find that superfluous.</seg>
<seg id="2108">There are enough of them in our city.</seg>
<seg id="2109">You can see how many shops are empty here - some for months and years.</seg>
<seg id="2110">But since there is not even a regular weekly market, it is all the more important that at least the Markthalle remains available to us.</seg>
<seg id="2111">Because after all the goods offered there are fresh, mostly offered directly by the producer and is also a good value for money.</seg>
<seg id="2112">As you can see, stores in a shopping mall are rented only by larger companies, because the local rents are often unsustainable for a retailer.</seg>
<seg id="2113">Too bad, there is almost no special business, and that which is still left will probably disappear. "</seg>
<seg id="2114">Wolf Fandel: "a shopping mall with a market hall doesn't fit together for me.</seg>
<seg id="2115">And the gallery does not fit to Bitburg.</seg>
<seg id="2116">First of all: where is the peasant market hall planned during the construction period?</seg>
<seg id="2117">The old Edeka would be the solution - also in the long run if the bit gallery comes up sometime.</seg>
<seg id="2118">Or does the spectral bit gallery succeeds in selling all the businesses from Bitburg? "</seg>
<seg id="2119">George Marquet: "it just won't work.</seg>
<seg id="2120">And no one needs a shopping center that stands empty.</seg>
<seg id="2121">In my opinion it would have been better to promote a real farmer's market instead of this gallery.</seg>
<seg id="2122">But for a peasant market hall there is no place in Bitburg thanks to the unbelievably many - as I find - senseless construction projects in Bitburg.</seg>
<seg id="2123">When the peasant market hall is destroyed, a piece of culture will disappear. "</seg>
<seg id="2124">A matching similarity: artist creates portraits of Chelsea Manning's DNA</seg>
<seg id="2125">In the middle of the space of the Fridman Gallery in New York, many faces can be seen - white, black and brown, which are almost imperceptible - hang on cables from the ceiling.</seg>
<seg id="2126">The 30 portraits were created by the artist Heather Dewey-Hagborg from Wangen tubs and haircuts sent to her by Chelsea Manning.</seg>
<seg id="2127">Manning sent excerpts from Fort Leavenworth prison, where the former intelligence analyst served a 35-year prison term after she publicly disclosed diplomatic messages about WikiLeaks's website.</seg>
<seg id="2128">The new exhibition opened on August 2 is called A Becoming's emblance (A matching similarity).</seg>
<seg id="2129">She is the product of two years correspondence between Dewey-Hagborg, whose discipline united her expertise in technology, computer science and art, and Manning, a transman and a pioneering dissident, whose conviction was transformed by Barack Obama when he had only three days in his ministry.</seg>
<seg id="2130">Dewey-Hagborg has created an algorithmic analysis of DNA extracted from maning and created from the 30 portraits, as someone with these genomic data could look like, a sharp albeit intellectual commentary not only to the formation of DNA data - the many ways they can be interpreted and the inherent determinism of these interpretations - but also for identity.</seg>
<seg id="2131">Manning, who was born as Bradley Edward but had already spoken openly about the identification as a woman since puberty, was convicted of 20 charges in 2013, including six violations of the law of espionage, computer fraud and theft.</seg>
<seg id="2132">Her picture was suppressed by the prison, so much that there was only one photo - a grainy, black-and-white selfie, in which Manning visibly sits unwell on a driver's seat and wearing a platinblonde wig - with which she was associated.</seg>
<seg id="2133">In 2015, Dewey-Hagborg came from the great success of her 2012 'Stranger Visions' project.</seg>
<seg id="2134">In this, the artist produced portraits of strangers from forensic artifacts such as cigarette butts and chewing gum by extracting DNA from waste to make a picture of how these people might look.</seg>
<seg id="2135">That was the time she received an email from a newspaper magazine.</seg>
<seg id="2136">"they conducted an interview with Chelsea Manning while she was in prison and wanted a kind of portrait to accompany this article," explained Dewey-Hagborg in a press preview of the new exhibition.</seg>
<seg id="2137">And she could not be visited at that time and she could not be photographed, so she contacted Chelsea and asked her if she wanted to make a DNA portrait.</seg>
<seg id="2138">The artist and her imprisoned muse became too unequal letters exchanges, which over the course of two years exchanged several letters.</seg>
<seg id="2139">They even created a Comic "Suppressed Images" illustrated by Shoili Kanungo, who foresaw a future in which the President of Chelsea would change judgment and would be able to see the exhibition personally.</seg>
<seg id="2140">That Obama was actually only a few days after the book was released to demand crew release after seven brutal years in a military prison in Kansas was a welcome sort of happy coincidence.</seg>
<seg id="2141">There is also a little deep and heavy at the opening of the exhibition, as Donald Trump leads a war against informants from the government camp and against Transatlantic troops to find new, tweetable ways to further inflame the rigid divisions that he should actually fix.</seg>
<seg id="2142">When Dewey-Hagborg was asked about the strange timing of all these things, she said "things happen for a certain reason."</seg>
<seg id="2143">In a artistic statement written down on the wall of the gallery, Manning called for her signature (the "i" in her family name with a heart) an end to the "automatic dispersion, whose basis sex, race, sexuality and culture have been."</seg>
<seg id="2144">On the opposite wall is their mitochondrial DNA sequence - a thousandth of Cs and Gs and As, written in pencil.</seg>
<seg id="2145">Dewey-Hagborg hoped to show through the inclusion of the 200 letters (or nucleotides according to the highly developed scientific encyclopedia of the artist), as amazingly similar, at least in biological terms, we are all.</seg>
<seg id="2146">"what people will hopefully take with us is that our genome does not care about who we are and how open genetic data is for an interpretation and how subjectively they are," said Dewey-Hagborg, whose video work of 2007, Spurious Memories, is also to be seen.</seg>
<seg id="2147">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "DNA data can tell so many different stories, so the 30 stories are." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2148">The last piece in the exhibition, which is stored in a separate room, is a page from the above mentioned comic-novel.</seg>
<seg id="2149">It shows Manning as she appears with a hands-free talk in the hands of the disciplinary barracks of the United States such as King Kong.</seg>
<seg id="2150">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "when they kiss your speech, they have won." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2151">"so never stop the mouth."</seg>
<seg id="2152">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "it came directly from a letter they wrote to me," "" "" "" "said the artist, who salutes Philadelphia." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2153">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "I still get goosebumps when I talk about it." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2154">Manning has not seen the exhibition personally - as it was anticipated in the comic book - but if it should do it, it will be welcomed in the middle of the room by the masks, from her own genomic simulacre, who rally like hordes of protesters.</seg>
<seg id="2155">This was also aimed at how everything was written in the exhibition, up to size (5 "2, Manning Stature), where their genetic haplogroups were written with a pencil.</seg>
<seg id="2156">"in the past I had them on the wall, but I wanted them to feel like a crowd," said Dewey-Hagborg from the portraits.</seg>
<seg id="2157">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "I wanted it to feel like a mass movement that formed with Chelsea like the movement that was also behind its liberation." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2158">Professor of the University of Northwestern and an employee of the University of Oxford because of killing</seg>
<seg id="2159">A national human hunt is underway for a professor at Northwestern University and an employee of the University of Oxford who are looking for suspects after a man has been stabbed to death in a luxurious residential apartment in Chicago.</seg>
<seg id="2160">On Monday, for Wyndham Lathem (42) and Andrew Warren (56) arrest warrants were issued for murder on account of their alleged involvement in the death of Trenton H. James Cornell-Duranleau, as the acts of the District Court of Cook County show.</seg>
<seg id="2161">The documents tell that Cornell-Duranleau, 26, died after several stitches.</seg>
<seg id="2162">A communal warning system published by the Chicago Police Department states that the corpse was discovered on 27 July.</seg>
<seg id="2163">Officials received a call, arrived at the Grand Plaza Apartments and found the victim with several injuries to his body.</seg>
<seg id="2164">Cornell-Duranleau was declared dead in the place of events, and detectives examine the stitches as murder, while the police actively seek the two suspects, officials said.</seg>
<seg id="2165">Laa has been an associate professor of microbiology and immunology at Northwestern University since 2007.</seg>
<seg id="2166">Alan K. Cubischer, vice-president for university relations, said in an e-mail statement that Laa must now be certified and excluded from entering the Northwestern University campus.</seg>
<seg id="2167">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "this is now a criminal affair examined by the competent authorities and Northwestern University co-operates with this investigation," "" "" "" "said Cubischer." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2168">Warren is Senior Treasury Assistant at Oxford University.</seg>
<seg id="2169">A speaker of the University and Somerville College said in an email statement that "we are in contact with the police in the UK and are ready to help the US investigative authorities in any way possible."</seg>
<seg id="2170">The statement added that Warren's colleagues were shocked and want him to stand.</seg>
<seg id="2171">Chief Communications Officer of the Chicago Police Department, Anthony Guglielmi, said he urged the suspects to face up to the authorities.</seg>
<seg id="2172">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "the police have an idea of their whereabouts, and our efforts to locate them reinforce," "" "" "" "said Guglielmi." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2173">Guglielmi said that local, regional and national authorities help to find the suspects.</seg>
<seg id="2174">Guglielmi said the police received a call from the building manager of the Grand Plaza building who had just received an enigmatic tip, saying that something happened in apartment 1008.</seg>
<seg id="2175">The police described the scene very cruel.</seg>
<seg id="2176">Guglielmi said it was unclear whether the incident occurred on 27 July.</seg>
<seg id="2177">It was confirmed by security cameras that Lathem and Warren were in the building.</seg>
<seg id="2178">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "we believe Professor Latham and the victim had a relationship," "" "" "" "said Guglielmi." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2179">The management team of Grand Plaza published an explanation to the residents: "the police are currently working on the time axis and the background of the victim and explores a multitude of motives, including a possible domestic incident."</seg>
<seg id="2180">"we will complete the WADA timetable in the near future," - Russian Vice President Mutko</seg>
<seg id="2181">Russian Deputy Prime Minister Vitaly Mutko said it will not last long until the remaining criteria of the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) are implemented for the restoration of the Russian Anti-Doping Agency (RUSADA).</seg>
<seg id="2182">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "in a certain stage of meeting the criteria of the roadmap, RUSADA has the right to plan and test in cooperation with UKAD (UK Anti-Doping)." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2183">"" "" "" "the WADA timetable was updated in this respect," "" "" "" "said Mutko on Thursday." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2184">The PM quoted the second part of the WADA schedule to comply with the code describing the criteria for the re-release of RUSADA and recently published on the organisation's website.</seg>
<seg id="2185">According to Mutko, he doesn't have anything to concern for Russia.</seg>
<seg id="2186">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "everything was announced, everything is being implemented." "" "" "</seg>
<seg id="2187">And the results will be presented to the International Olympic Committee (IOC) and WADA in the near future, "he added.</seg>
<seg id="2188">However, one of the criteria listed in the list indicates that Russian anti-doping authorities must publicly accept the reported results of the investigation approved by the WADA by Canadian solicitor Richard McLaren to state subsidized doping in Russian sports.</seg>
<seg id="2189">"" "" "" "mutko said:" "" "" "" "we carry out the investigation because our anti-doping system got an error." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2190">All measures have been implemented.</seg>
<seg id="2191">"" "" "" "but there were no government programs and we won't give anything that doesn't exist." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2192">Mutko's words coincided with those of Vitaly Smirnov, the leader of the independent Russian Anti-Doping Commission.</seg>
<seg id="2193">In conversation with the Russian sales office rsport at the beginning of the day Smirnov gave problems of the past in Russian anti-doping organizations, but added: "we have repeatedly said that the report contains controversial positions and regulations.</seg>
<seg id="2194">"" "" "" "no one pretends to accept this report unconditionally," "" "" "" "added Smirnov." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2195">In November 2015, RUSADA was excluded from the implementation of doping controls in Russia as part of the doping scandal.</seg>
<seg id="2196">However, it was allowed to plan and coordinate tests under the supervision of international experts and the UK Anti-Doping (UKAD).</seg>
<seg id="2197">After a visit to the headquarters of the Moscow organization in July, WADA General Director Olivier Niggli stated that RUSADA moved "in the right direction" to be used again.</seg>

<seg id="2203">The start-ups that will help your company not become the next Uber</seg>
<seg id="2204">Amy Errett wanted to measure luck at your e-commerce start-up, but the surveys did not work.</seg>
<seg id="2205">Answers were often vague, little helpful, or worse - deceitful.</seg>
<seg id="2206">And even if you promised anonymity some workers did not trust the process.</seg>
<seg id="2207">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "there was simply never consistency and objectivity," "" "" "" "said Errett, who runs the 75-person San Francisco e-Commerce Hair Care Association Madison Reed." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2208">She called people from outside for help.</seg>
<seg id="2209">A new Human Resource start-up race is growing to help companies find out how their employees feel.</seg>
<seg id="2210">By creating and licensing software that has the specific purpose of measuring employee engagement, it enables companies to conduct surveys, to offer special groups and demographic groups, employees anonymity and complaint hotlines, and in some cases whistleblowers allow to circumvent the C-Suite executives and turn directly to the Board of Directors.</seg>
<seg id="2211">"you now have tools like Strava and Fitbit for tracking their health, but where is the Fitbit for your company?" said Jim Barnett, co-founder and Chief Executive of Redwood City Start-up GLINT, whose software analytics tools are used by companies to measure employees commitment.</seg>
<seg id="2212">Errett said that she gained a better insight into what your employees think and feel in the three years with GLINT.</seg>
<seg id="2213">In addition to the snap-surveys and surveys of certain teams, it offers a heat map of the company that shows at a glance which units have most complaints and which executives have low approvals - so that you can reboot, why.</seg>
<seg id="2214">Companies are coming to see that they have to stay at the top of the workplace culture so that you won't be the next Uber involved in scandals since a former employee has published a blog post that describes an environment of nuisances, in which those who have spoken are punished.</seg>
<seg id="2215">For start-ups such as GLINT, this wish for an overview is a lucrative business opportunity.</seg>
<seg id="2216">The Global Governance, Regulation and Compliance industry could have more than $118.7 billion in 2020, according to the financial website Let's Talk Payments.</seg>
<seg id="2217">Denver, Colorado, Start-up Convercent, the company helps to prevent bad behavior and recognize, saw an increasing interest and activity at the beginning of this year in the middle of the Uber-Falles in Misskredit.</seg>
<seg id="2218">Cent has nearly 600 clients including Airbnb, Microsoft and Tesla.</seg>
<seg id="2219">Recently, the client registered as a client.</seg>
<seg id="2220">Like GLINT, Convercent can send customized "pulse" surveys, collect sensitive responses in real time and view the heat maps of your problem areas.</seg>
<seg id="2221">It also provides an anonymous SMS hotline that allows staff to report poor behavior.</seg>
<seg id="2222">And if the main business leader is involved, complaints go directly to the Supervisory Board.</seg>
<seg id="2223">"the court of public opinion has captured the regulators," said Patrick Quinlan, the founder and managing director of Convercent.</seg>
<seg id="2224">When a company finds its employees badly treated or behaved unethical, it can experience costly consequences by consumer boycott, employee fluctuation and complaints, said Quinlan.</seg>
<seg id="2225">Ruby Tuesday, the restaurant chain with more than 25,000 employees and over 500 locations, has implemented Convercent for more than a year to ensure that employees are aware of policies and procedures and have an easy way to achieve their corporate headquarters.</seg>
<seg id="2226">Earlier, if an employee wanted to report a problem, he or she had to find a phone number or email for the company headquarters, submit a formal complaint and hope that he was taken seriously.</seg>
<seg id="2227">It was often an intimidation and uncomfortable experience, said James Vitrano, Ruby Tuesdays General Counsel who said there was no good way to track the complaints of employees.</seg>
<seg id="2228">Now that the company uses Convercent, problems that were previously hidden by managers who were sitting in offices in cities or states - such as discrimination, harassment or unfair practic- quicker identified and addressed.</seg>
<seg id="2229">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "I can approach this holistic, 360-degree view of experience with employment," "" "" "" "said Vitrano, who leads the risk management group from Ruby Tuesday." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2230">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "and we protect our shareholders against employment disputes." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2231">Companies began to take Ethics, Values and Employees Engagement in 2002 after the accounting firm Arthur Andersen collapsed because of ethical violations by the Enron scandal, Quinlan said.</seg>
<seg id="2232">But it took until the "social media came to their right" that companies realized that they could not prevent their dirty laundry going online.</seg>
<seg id="2233">"before using technology to monitor ethics, people used hope as a strategy," he said.</seg>
<seg id="2234">Both GLINT and Convercent offer their software as a service and burden the companies with recurring charges for the use of their products.</seg>
<seg id="2235">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "it is a business model and a chance to find the approval of venture capital investors that have supported both start-ups." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2236">Convercent received $10 million in financing in February of companies such as Sapphire Ventures and Tola Capital, raising the total capital to $47 million.</seg>
<seg id="2237">Glitzers secured himself $10 million in November of Bessemer's Venture Partners and brought his total funding to $60 million.</seg>
<seg id="2238">These investments are hardly surprising given the connected nature of enterprises, culture and venture capital.</seg>
<seg id="2239">There is a growing research complex that shows that today's employees expect more from their jobs than before.</seg>
<seg id="2240">High salaries and interesting projects are only used in competitive markets such as Silicon Valley.</seg>
<seg id="2241">The employees want to feel that you are accepted and appreciated and that you give your time to a company with a positive mission.</seg>
<seg id="2242">"when people are happy to be in a company, feel that their voices are worth it, and that the work you do is worth doing," said Nina McQueen, Vice President of Global Benefits and Employee Experience on LinkedIn, which uses both Convercent and GLINT.</seg>
<seg id="2243">Investors gain margins when their portfolio companies are running well. companies are running well when employees are committed and engaged.</seg>
<seg id="2244">If the analytics tools of third parties promise to increase commitment and commitment to employees, it is no wonder that you will find support.</seg>
<seg id="2245">The data on employee engagement is important according to the workplace culture experts.</seg>
<seg id="2246">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "but the data is useless if the caretaker of a company does not take action." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2247">In fact, if a company asks staff for your feedback, there may be a expectation that change is on the way.</seg>
<seg id="2248">And if the changes are not fast enough, or not at all, this can cause disappointments and demotify employees.</seg>
<seg id="2249">"if you ask about 4,000 questions, you must be ready to have 4,000 conversations," said Russell Raath, President of Consulting at the Business Management company Kotter International, who has seen companies that have too much relied on collecting data.</seg>
<seg id="2250">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "because if you do not follow employee, ask," "" "" "" "Have you really heard me?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2251">Do you care about it?</seg>
<seg id="2252">"" "" "" "and if you don't care about it, why should I?" "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2253">Madison Reed, who now carries out monthly employee surveys, has been able to initiate actions on the same day if a problem is reported on GLINT, says Errett.</seg>
<seg id="2254">And after collecting feedback from frustrated employees, it was through the speed of decision making and the quality of communication, capable of reorganizing several teams within the company and adding a communication training to address the problems.</seg>
<seg id="2255">With Ruby Tuesday, the company will always receive new insights into employees, and it hopes that in the long run, this leads to a better engagement of employees in an industry known for high turnover.</seg>
<seg id="2256">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "if you are not obligated to create a culture of transparency, you will lose people," "" "" "" "said Vitrano." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2257">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "and if you lose people, you also lose customers." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="2260">It's about 11pm when a lot of UCLA football players entertain themselves on one side of the new practice areas of the team on the campus.</seg>
<seg id="2261">Some have pulled out their jersey parts and show the back full of sweat from the first day of the training camp.</seg>
<seg id="2262">For a good part of the team these idle minutes constitute a lunch break.</seg>

<seg id="2264">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "this is a real treadmill for the boys," "" "" "" "said Bruins-Trainer Jim Mora just before Monday became Tuesday." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2265">The NCAA eliminates two-day exercises to ease the load of the players, and it has actually prolonged their days - at least until the final on Friday.</seg>
<seg id="2266">Therefore, the first three trainings of the UCLA should start at 19: 15 in order to meet the already packed schedules of the players.</seg>
<seg id="2267">The compromise from the two days is more than a day when the Bruges shifted the beginning of the camp almost a week after the last season and during the summer school for the first time during Moras six playing times in Westwood conducted practical exercises.</seg>
<seg id="2268">They are supposed to hold 18 exercises during August. 20 before the start of the formal game preparations for their prelude to Texas A & M in September.</seg>

<seg id="2290">Creating a comic novel: a castle in the history of England</seg>
<seg id="2291">In his younger past, the little Scotney Castle was seen in a squeeze music video and was a loophole for Margaret Thatcher in the 1970 "s and 1980's.</seg>
<seg id="2292">But Scotney has experienced 700 years of turbulent history from his cozy seat in the Beware River Valley in Kent and has now become an inspiration for a graphic novel by Jamie Rhodes, a cosmopolitan Yorkshireman with a preference for historical documents.</seg>
<seg id="2293">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "I find it so nice to look at the signature of someone who has been dead for 300 years," "" "" "" "he says bitterly." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="2295">'A Castle in England 'spans the time from the Middle Ages to the age of Edward and documents the families living in Scotney. each story was illustrated by another British artist coming up - Isaac steering iewicz, Briony May Smith, William Exley, Becky Palmer and Isabel Greenberg.</seg>
<seg id="2296">It is not the first book of Rhodes based on an archive: he wrote 'Dead Men's Teeth and Other Stories', a collection inspired by documents in the British Library - a project that he found unexpectedly emotional.</seg>
<seg id="2297">"I just reacted to the thumb print on the side of a letter that was written by a double agent in the 1700's, who worked for the Jacobins," he says.</seg>
<seg id="2298">"this is his thumb print!</seg>
<seg id="2299">And letters always smell smoke, for at that time a fire was kindled because of the light.</seg>
<seg id="2300">For someone who lives 300 years later, the smell has an effect as if he were there himself.</seg>
<seg id="2301">Oh, I love archives! "</seg>
<seg id="2302">For someone who is so beaten with old papers that he is supported by the National Trust and the Arts Council England and lived in a castle for almost four months ("To be honest: I have overrated my welcome-greeting") seems to be all too beautiful to be true.</seg>
<seg id="2303">Rhodes spent his days exploring the Victorian "new" castle, viewing the archives and studying the many treasures and curiosities of the castle, such as the mounted hyena heads on the walls and the bottles that had been spent centuries in digging.</seg>
<seg id="2304">He walked through the terrain and the ruins of the old castle and spoke with landscape flares, gardeners and sometimes with the artists who worked on the illustrations of his book.</seg>
<seg id="2305">Then at night he drank whiskey and started writing. "</seg>
<seg id="2306">The intimate story of Scotney is relatively unknown because the National Trust was granted full access only in 2006 when the last heir, Elizabeth Hussey, died.</seg>
<seg id="2307">When Rhodes arrived a decade later, the employees just started to take care of the archive, which he described as "hundreds of years, in which aristocrats said" Oh, throw it on the attic. "</seg>
<seg id="2308">Diaries, letters from the period of English Empires, cards that represent who possessed something: "one could think that land conflicts would be boring," Rhodes says, "but there was a birch to fight the two families.</seg>
<seg id="2309">Guys, let's go all the way! "</seg>
<seg id="2310">Some of the stories in the collection use the castle as a starting point to dive into English history, including 'The Labourer', which follows a man who leaves the newly built castle to join the peasant uprising of 1381.</seg>
<seg id="2311">"there is a record of a revolt that occurred in the castle in 1380, in this book entitled 'Knightly Family of Kent and Sussex'," Rhodes says.</seg>
<seg id="2312">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "the uprising started in this area and I thought that an insurrection was a good start." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2313">Perhaps they are connected with each other? "</seg>
<seg id="2314">Other stories are firmly rooted in the history of the castle - like 'The Priest', which tells the story of the Jesuit patrons that the Darrell family hid for seven years during the English Reformation.</seg>
<seg id="2315">Or 'The Smuggler', in which the smuggler Arthur Darrell is portrayed from the 18th century, who staging his own funeral by filling a coffin with stones (a discovery that was made years later when his coffin was dug out).</seg>
<seg id="2316">The Darrells are Rhodes's favourite family of Scotney: "gentlemen seemed to be quite crook, always making debts and spending money on things they could not afford.</seg>
<seg id="2317">Other generations of Darrell men relied on their debt crises by marrying rich old women - I imagine them as a bunch of well-looking guys, with a talent to recruit vomiting. "</seg>
<seg id="2318">After the end of his commitment in the castle Rhodes is searching for other unique writing experiences</seg>
<seg id="2319">He has had a two-week stay in the Finnish wilderness for a comic novel about Elämänmäki, the site of a sanatorium from the early 20th century, which has since been reclaimed by nature.</seg>

<seg id="2337">Military reforms in Turkey - Erdogan's fear of the army</seg>
<seg id="2338">Every year at the beginning of August, the Supreme Military Council (YAS) advises on boarding and transport in the officer corps.</seg>
<seg id="2339">So also this week.</seg>
<seg id="2340">At first sight a normal process.</seg>
<seg id="2341">But nothing is routine with the Turkish forces one year after the coup attempt.</seg>
<seg id="2342">The meeting was not held in the headquarters of the General Staff, as in the past, but at the presidency of the Prime Minister.</seg>
<seg id="2343">The meetings took place under the presidency of the Heads of Government now also the five Deputy Prime Ministers and the Defence, Home Affairs, Justice and Foreign Affairs Ministers.</seg>
<seg id="2344">This was the number of civilians in the YAS.</seg>
<seg id="2345">The government tightened the reins in the military.</seg>
<seg id="2346">The chief of staff, Hulusi Akar, remained in office, but the officers of the army, the Air Force and the Navy were dismissed.</seg>
<seg id="2347">Since the failed coup, head of state Erdogan 169 has fired 326 generals and admirals.</seg>
<seg id="2348">More than 10,000 soldiers were removed from the ranks of the army - mostly due to alleged connections to the movement of the exiled preacher Fethullah Gülen, who sees Erdogan as a leader of the coup attempt.</seg>
<seg id="2349">Against 486 persons who have been directly involved in the coup attempt, Ankara has been negotiated in Ankara since this week.</seg>
<seg id="2350">Already on the day after the coup, Erdogan had designated the overthrow of a "God present," as he gave him the opportunity to "cleanse the armed forces."</seg>
<seg id="2351">But Erdogan actually has the army under control?</seg>
<seg id="2352">At the end of February, the paper "Hürriyet" published an article entitled "Unease in Military Headquarters."</seg>
<seg id="2353">In the general staff there are concerns about an increasing "Islamization" of the army, which, among other things, manifests itself in the lifting of the headset prohibition for soldiers, the newspaper wrote.</seg>
<seg id="2354">In any case, the major coach of the army and the security forces continues.</seg>
<seg id="2355">In mid-July, Erdogan, by decree, ordered more 7395 national servants, including 2303 policemen and 546 soldiers.</seg>
<seg id="2356">It seemed as though Erdogan had tamed the military.</seg>
<seg id="2357">The generals were formerly considered to be the real masters of the country.</seg>
<seg id="2358">Three times they appeal to their role as guardians of the secular state order.</seg>
<seg id="2359">After his election victory in 2002, Erdogan pushed back the power of the military step by step, not least of his appeal to the reform targets of the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2360">Former officers say Erdogan is targeting a mobilization of the armed forces.</seg>
<seg id="2361">In the magazine "Vocal Europe," a particularly unnamed officer who sought refuge after the coup attempt in fear of persecution in foreign countries, the Turkish army would be "full extremists and Salafists in just a few years."</seg>
<seg id="2362">If this is true, such a development could not leave NATO cold.</seg>
<seg id="2363">In any case, there is doubt in the alliance after the cleansing of the Turkish army.</seg>

<seg id="2368">The new rules are proposed by the Republicans and supported by the President.</seg>

<seg id="2373">Ministry wants to rehabilitate track for race car shuttle</seg>
<seg id="2374">Again and again over the past few months over the future of the racing shuttle had been fought - now it should go very quickly.</seg>
<seg id="2375">Before the end of the year, the route on which the tourist train runs, is to be built on the route.</seg>
<seg id="2376">In order to secure the future of the racing shuttle in the long run, construction work on the track should begin again this year according to the Ministry of Transport.</seg>
<seg id="2377">"with the decision to further order and rehabilitate the Ilmenau-Rennsteig route, the country commits itself to this particularly important link for tourism," said Secretary of State Klaus Sühl on Friday in Erfurt.</seg>
<seg id="2378">The cost of repairing the route was reduced to about 2.5 million euros.</seg>
<seg id="2379">From this sum, the country will take 75 percent.</seg>
<seg id="2380">The contract, on the basis of which the shuttle will also be ordered by the country in the future, will be finalised at the moment, declared Sühl.</seg>
<seg id="2381">The Ministry and the South Thuringia railway as operator agree on the technical details already.</seg>
<seg id="2382">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "this means that the roadmap, the vehicles used and the quality standards are negotiated," "" "" "" "Sühl said." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2383">The planned contract between the ministry and the railway company will be closed for a period of eleven years.</seg>
<seg id="2384">This makes the race platform shuttle be ordered regularly on December 2017.</seg>
<seg id="2385">The Rennsteig-Shuttle is a popular rail link between the Ilmenau and Rennsteig railway stations.</seg>
<seg id="2386">Over the past few months, a pilot plant has been tested to determine whether the route is being used by a large number of people to order them regularly in the future.</seg>
<seg id="2387">The track is also heavily bumpy in parts.</seg>
<seg id="2388">The rise of sex robots is real and we should be worried</seg>
<seg id="2389">Just as you thought it can't become even more crazy in 2017, a new report about the technological developments in the area of sex robots.</seg>
<seg id="2390">Yes, actually.</seg>
<seg id="2391">Sex robots are currently a great thing.</seg>
<seg id="2392">Recently, the Foundation for Responsible Robotics (FRR) published a report on the development of sex robots in the next five to ten years.</seg>
<seg id="2393">According to Noel Sharkey, Emeritus Professor of Robotics and Artificial Intelligence at Sheffield University and co-founder of the FRR, we must begin taking Ascension seriously.</seg>
<seg id="2394">Customers can choose the eye color of the robot, its shape of the nipple and the type of fingernail.</seg>
<seg id="2395">"people make fun of it, but the companies deliver a lot of it, and we will see them much more often," Mr. Sharkey said in the publication of his new report.</seg>
<seg id="2396">Modern sex dolls have evolved from their inflatable partners to robots with a silicone membrane that feels warm - with consciously human reactions that are achieved by artificial intelligence.</seg>
<seg id="2397">The user can also "adjust" his robot according to his beliefs, and select everything from the eye color of the robot over the shape of the nipples to the type or color of his fingernails.</seg>
<seg id="2398">But it becomes more troubling as many robots have the "personalities" that would make a stepford woman look progressive.</seg>
<seg id="2399">Modern sex dolls have developed to robots with a silicone skin.</seg>
<seg id="2400">For example, the RealBotix robot allows its users to adapt their robots to the properties they find appealing such as shyness.</seg>
<seg id="2401">And then there are the Roxxxxe gold sex robots developed by True Companion with pre-programmed personalities like "Frigid Farrah," which conveys the impression of shyness and "Wild Wendy" with an "adventurous" personality.</seg>
<seg id="2402">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "Roxxxy Gold has a personality that is as good as possible to your personality," "" "" "" "enthuses the True Companion website." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2403">So she likes what you like, and she doesn't like what you don't like, etc.</seg>
<seg id="2404">She also has her moods in the course of the day - just like real people!</seg>
<seg id="2405">She can be tired, be fixed to conversation or she can "be in mood!"</seg>
<seg id="2406">There are many disturbing aspects of this rise of sex robots - not least because they replace real human relationships - but the subservient feminine traits, the allusions to rape, when one takes a step towards Frigid (here: reluctant) Farrah, are troubled at most.</seg>
<seg id="2407">True Companion Roxxxy has a vibrator on his website, but for men.</seg>
<seg id="2408">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "if women (sic) can have a vibrator, why can men then have no Roxxxy?" "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2409">However, these sex robots are not just a fetish or just another sex toy.</seg>
<seg id="2410">Their origin and their increasing sophistication point to something darker and deeper in our culture, on a retreat from the ideal of gender equality towards a desire for sex with submission as an optional encore.</seg>
<seg id="2411">Most men will of course not hold any sex robots, and while the FRR noted their rising popularity, they remain on the brink of consumer culture.</seg>
<seg id="2412">But what seeps out of the marginal areas can be very instructive regarding the spirit of the time in which we live.</seg>
<seg id="2413">And many people are not odd or insulting until the free market gives them permission.</seg>
<seg id="2414">There is a certain overlap that these highly developed sex robots occur in a time in which the rights of women are threatened worldwide, in which there is a president in the White House who has been boasting to have women sexually assaulted.</seg>
<seg id="2415">The most dreadful aspect of the TV series' The Handmaid's Tale '(' The Report of the maid ') are not the graphical images, the worn body and the stochrome eyes, but how realistic this vision works.</seg>
<seg id="2416">The Republic of Gilead is a leap, but at the moment it does not feel like a great leap.</seg>
<seg id="2417">The goal behind these sex robots is to make a physical likeness to actual women as realistic as possible (albeit with pornostar proportions).</seg>
<seg id="2418">Their builders want them to feel human that they imitate the movement of a real body.</seg>
<seg id="2419">But, when it comes to their "personalities," the robots are not real women.</seg>
<seg id="2420">They cannot separate themselves from their companion or simply walk away.</seg>
<seg id="2421">They have no intermediation or background story, nothing that hinders independence or anything that could disturb the fantasy of total submission.</seg>
<seg id="2422">In other words, they are fake slaves.</seg>
<seg id="2423">Or to express it in the speech of 2017: maids</seg>
<seg id="2424">Trumps great performance?</seg>
<seg id="2425">He makes Mitt Romney the epitome of common sense</seg>
<seg id="2426">It has become a truism of the Trump era that the political divisions that polarized the US voters have also split families in small format.</seg>
<seg id="2427">There were newspapers around Christmas and Thanksgiving in the USA with advice on how to deal with the horror of Trump-choosing relatives.</seg>
<seg id="2428">We are all committed to cutting off our filter bags.</seg>
<seg id="2429">Less noticed is the power of Trumps to bring together families.</seg>
<seg id="2430">I mention this because my cousin, a leftless poet who lives in Chicago and has long been busy with the Republicans in our family, visited me this week in New York.</seg>
<seg id="2431">It reminded me that the unity against a common enemy can have a powerful effect.</seg>
<seg id="2432">With Trump in the White House, everyone whom she knows, including the republican relationship, with which she struggled for decades for politics, suddenly and quite peculiarly on the same side.</seg>
<seg id="2433">For the dining table this is certainly a good thing, but it falls to me in a further context that this also entails considerable risks.</seg>
<seg id="2434">The left has been strengthened by Trump, but the horrifying effect of his presidency has the power to push us all to the right.</seg>
<seg id="2435">When we speak of "normalization" and "trump," we refer to the gratifying possibility that his kittens won't be repelled one day.</seg>
<seg id="2436">However, there is an even more difficult long-term scenario in which Trump Republicans of the right wing "normalize," which suddenly appear as the epitome of reasonableness in comparison to its standards.</seg>
<seg id="2437">I find myself today attacked by an active nostalgia for Mitt Romney's original version of the decline - the dog on the car roof, the 14% income tax (but at least we knew how his tax return looked like) - both of which are in fact a very mild crime compared to trump.</seg>
<seg id="2438">When Trump goes, the next candidate of the Republicans must be mentally healthy in order to qualify as immeasurable improvement.</seg>
<seg id="2439">When my cousin was in the city, we brought our kids to the carousel in Central Park, the largest of the carousels of the New York car park department, and the best three dollars you can spend in the city if you don't need caffeine.</seg>
<seg id="2440">The horses are huge, the fiberglass designs on the central cylinder - all clowns are tight and the animals turn out to look full of fear over their own shoulders - extremely dark and the climatic music conveys this in a curious way.</seg>
<seg id="2441">So many clichés of a city disappoint: the views of tall buildings become old, the skylines are too familiar to offer much excitement, and the reality of the city does not do justice to the dream.</seg>
<seg id="2442">Thirty-five years later, and I am still not quite over the day when I found out that Swiss Cottage is indeed not a Swiss Cottage - the Topic Pub Ye Olde Swiss Cottage does not count - but a big roundabout in northern London.</seg>
<seg id="2443">But the Central Park carousel is still a strange magic experience, because here two-year-old, an 11-year-old and two women in the 40-s can go on it and have all a great time.</seg>
<seg id="2444">If I could have evaluated the carousel I would have given him the full score, but luckily nobody asked for it.</seg>
<seg id="2445">On the other hand, this week, I was forced to evaluate my "experience" with transactions on a scale of one to five stars before I could pass my credit card.</seg>
<seg id="2446">In the coffee house at the corner of my street it is the same, plus the option to balance the rating with a 15% tip - this to buy something about the counter.</seg>
<seg id="2447">This not only leads to a slowdown of what actually should be a neutral exchange, but also exerts pressure on the server to bring personality into a situation where none is required.</seg>
<seg id="2448">The poor woman in the department store was apprehensive, while I tired the experience to reach her my credit card with five stars.</seg>
<seg id="2449">Oscar Pistorius transferred from prison to hospital with chest pain</seg>
<seg id="2450">Pistorius left the prison for a hospital visit for the second time.</seg>
<seg id="2451">Last year, he was brought to hospital for the treatment of cuts on his wrists, according to the prison authorities, according to a case in his cell.</seg>
<seg id="2452">Pistorius was convicted of murder after an appeal by the prosecutors against a first death sentence.</seg>
<seg id="2453">He killed Steenkamp in the early hours of Valentine's Day in 2013, placing them on them several times through a door of the toilet cabin in his house in Pretoria.</seg>
<seg id="2454">Pistorius claimed that he kept his girlfriend for a nocturnal intruder hiding in the cabin.</seg>
<seg id="2455">The prosecutors announced their intention to appeal this time to the six-year sentence of Pistorius Appell, of whom they say they are too lenient.</seg>
<seg id="2456">The National Prosecution Service said that it would appeal to the Supreme Court of South Africa and the appeal could be heard this year.</seg>
<seg id="2457">Pistorius is at risk that his sentence will be increased to 15 years if the prosecutors are successful.</seg>
<seg id="2458">There is no death penalty in South Africa.</seg>

<seg id="2460">As the last of the Blumberg schools, the four-quarters were sent from archers and donkeys to the holidays and to the secondary schools.</seg>
<seg id="2461">Three of the students will go to high school in the future, four to the secondary school.</seg>
<seg id="2462">On Tuesday evening school director Angelika Sitte welcomed the parents and representatives of the public at the Bürgerhaus Biesental in Epfenhofen.</seg>
<seg id="2463">The 29 pupils of the four classes, led by Sophia Schumacher and Regine Meder, chose a young eagle rising up in the poultry farm, but then released into freedom.</seg>
<seg id="2464">To do this, the lively band performed a musical with the title "The Eagle in the poultry farm."</seg>
<seg id="2465">Farmer Arnold found a strange egg, and left it out of his chickens.</seg>
<seg id="2466">Instead of a chicken-kens, a little eagle came out.</seg>
<seg id="2467">But the hope of making him a chicken shattered, and the eagle had spread its wings on a high mountain and swore.</seg>
<seg id="2468">After that, the classes showed three and four in the study of Yvonne Frank a chicken dance.</seg>
<seg id="2469">The hens danced with the young gockles carrying cylinders to the bet.</seg>
<seg id="2470">The Adler stands for integration, said school director Angelika Sitte.</seg>
<seg id="2471">The kitten is different from the other kittens (chicks), but belongs to it.</seg>
<seg id="2472">But he will never be like a chicken.</seg>
<seg id="2473">His determination is to be free.</seg>
<seg id="2474">She wished each fourth-vessel to feel accepted in his new school.</seg>
<seg id="2475">This was followed by a message of thanks to colleagues, former school manager Michael Müller, who repeatedly came up with teaching passports, and the parental representatives.</seg>

<seg id="2485">On the same day, they were released while a study is underway.</seg>
<seg id="2486">The Ministry of Foreign Affairs reported that the Bulgarians were later released.</seg>
<seg id="2487">The Greek authorities have tightened control over the free camp and put anyone who is found to stay in a place that is not intended for this purpose, fines substantial fines.</seg>
<seg id="2488">The controls are continued throughout the season.</seg>

<seg id="2579">Red meat, dairy products and chocolate could help to alleviate IBD (inflammatory bowel disease)</seg>
<seg id="2580">Red meat and chocolate can sound like a nightmare for your digestive system.</seg>
<seg id="2581">But a new study says exactly the opposite: a diet rich in meat-based proteins and dairy products could alleviate the symptoms of patients with inflammatory bowel disease.</seg>
<seg id="2582">The incurable condition affecting approximately 1.3 million and 300,000 in the United States causes stomach cramps and bloating, recurrent or bloody diarrhoea, weight loss and extreme tiredness.</seg>
<seg id="2583">While sufferers are usually advised to steer meat and dairy products to relieve their symptoms, researchers at the Washington University found that the essential amino acid tryptophan of proteins contributes to developing immune cells that promote a tolerant gut.</seg>
<seg id="2584">The leading researcher, Dr. Marco Colonna, explained that immune cells in the gut patrol in order to ensure that harmful microbes that hide in food are not penetrating into the body.</seg>
<seg id="2585">Cells capable of dissolving inflammation are evened by cells that promote tolerance and protect the body without damaging sensitive tissues.</seg>
<seg id="2586">If the balance is too far in the direction of inflammation, it can result in an inflammatory bowel disease.</seg>
<seg id="2587">In experiments it was found that a kind of tolerance-promoting immune cell occurs in mice that carry a certain bacterium in its intestines.</seg>
<seg id="2588">And the bacterium requires tryptophan - one of the building blocks of proteins - to cause the cell's appearance.</seg>
<seg id="2589">Professor Colonna said: "we have established a connection between a species of bacteria - Lactobacillus reuteri - which is a normal part of the gut microbiome, and the development of a population of cells that promote tolerance.</seg>
<seg id="2590">The more tryptophan the mice had in their food, the more they had of these immune cells. "</seg>
<seg id="2591">He suggested that the combination of L. reuteri and a diet rich in tryptophan will promote a more tolerant, less inflammatory intestinal disease if the same system also helps with people.</seg>
<seg id="2592">The post-doctoral candidate Dr. Luisa Cervantes-Barragan was investigating a kind of immune cell that promotes tolerance when she found out that a group of study mice had such cells, but a different group of the same trunk that was separated but not had.</seg>
<seg id="2593">They suspected that the difference with the intestinal microbes of the mice had to do - the community of bacteria, viruses and fungi that normally live in the gastrointestinal tract.</seg>
<seg id="2594">The intestines of the mice were sequenced DNA sequences and six bacterial species were found which were present in mice with the immune cells, but without missing them in mice.</seg>
<seg id="2595">Mice were treated in a sterile environment, so that they lacked an intestinal microbiome and did not develop these kinds of immune cells, and they received the L. reuteri and the immune cells.</seg>
<seg id="2596">In order to understand how the bacteria acted on the immune system, the researchers L. reuteri grew in a liquid and then transferred small amounts of the liquid - without the bacteria - on unripe immune cells that were isolated from the mice.</seg>
<seg id="2597">The immune cells developed into the tolerant cells.</seg>
<seg id="2598">When the active component was purified from the liquid, it proved to be a by-product of tryptophan metabolism, known as an idol-3 lactic acid.</seg>
<seg id="2599">If the researchers doubled the amount of tryptophan in mice's food, the number of cells increased by about 50 percent, but if the tryptophan was halved, the number of cells decreased by half.</seg>
<seg id="2600">Dr. Cervantes-Barragan declared that people have the same tolerant cells as mice, and that most of us L. reuteri protect in our gastrointestinal tracts.</seg>
<seg id="2601">It is not known whether tryptophan-by-products from L. reuteri develop the cells in humans as in mice, but defects in genes related to tryptophan were found in people with inflammatory bowel disease.</seg>
<seg id="2602">"" "" "" "she said," "" "" "" "The development of these cells is probably something we want to promote as these cells control inflammation on the inside surface of the intestine." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2603">Potentially high tryptophan values can lead to an extension of this population in the presence of L. reuteri. "</seg>

<seg id="2623">As the wind turns: when Sigmar Gabriel was still SPD leader, Social-Democratic Prime Ministers always looked to Berlin with a certain concern before elections.</seg>
<seg id="2624">Only no disturbance from the party centre, but no counter-wind from the Confederation - was the most important desire of the ballot fighters.</seg>
<seg id="2625">Since Martin Schulz leads the party, it has fundamentally changed.</seg>

<seg id="2638">Stephan Weil, the SPD Prime Minister of Lower Saxony, is at the CDU without his own government majority after the transition from the Green parliamentarians to the CDU.</seg>
<seg id="2639">It is the preliminary climax of a whole series of large and small crises in the SPD national associations.</seg>
<seg id="2640">And nobody knows what's next.</seg>
<seg id="2641">The misery began with the unexpectedly clear defeat at the Saarland election in March.</seg>
<seg id="2642">A blue eye, no longer, was comforted by the comrades at that time.</seg>
<seg id="2643">After the legislative elections in Schleswig-Holstein and North Rhine-Westphalia, everything will be different.</seg>
<seg id="2644">It was then - and things became much worse.</seg>
<seg id="2645">The defeat in Kiel triggered the SPD, the Düsseldorf bankruptcy slipped the party smoothly.</seg>
<seg id="2646">Laboriously, the comrades assembled in the weeks afterward.</seg>
<seg id="2647">Then, when they had just had new courage, the G-20 summit came from Hamburg.</seg>
<seg id="2648">And with him came the next low beat.</seg>
<seg id="2649">Mayor Olaf Scholz, the last strong SPD member of the SPD, lost his Nimbus that weekend because he was sitting in the Elbphilharmonie while his city was burning.</seg>
<seg id="2650">And because he did wrong in the way of crisis communication, what can be done wrong.</seg>
<seg id="2651">Since then, Scholz is fighting for his political survival.</seg>
<seg id="2652">So now also Stephan Weil.</seg>
<seg id="2653">Because of the VW-emissions affaires and its role in the Supervisory Board, the Prime Minister of Lower Saxony has been in criticism for quite some time.</seg>

<seg id="2672">If you want to renovate your house in the years to come, you will soon be able to receive support from the country.</seg>
<seg id="2673">In addition, mayor Albert Schindler and three representatives of Steg Urban Development were informed on Wednesday.</seg>
<seg id="2674">At the beginning of the information session, Schindler once again gave a review of what was happening.</seg>
<seg id="2675">Since 1991 it has been given in sensations rehabilitation areas.</seg>
<seg id="2676">At that time, in the renovation area I between 1991 and 2004, the state of Baden-Württemberg assumed two thirds of the total amount of funding.</seg>
<seg id="2677">In the rehabilitation zone II from 2005 to 2016, the subsidy was still 60 percent.</seg>
<seg id="2678">For Schindler, the previous refurbishments are a "success project" - it is finally important to encourage the development of the interior and not only to open up new building areas.</seg>
<seg id="2679">On April 4, I received the information from the Government Presidency of Karlsruhe that there will be a sanitation zone III.</seg>
<seg id="2680">The total sum of the funding amounted to 833 333 Euro, of which 500 000 Euros came from the country, the rest of the municipality's feeling.</seg>

<seg id="2682">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "one will, as Schindler continue to investigate, where the" "" "" "" "really old" "" "" "" "houses are." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2683">But it also plays a role as to whether there is interest in the planned area at all.</seg>
<seg id="2684">If necessary, the area borders may then move again.</seg>
<seg id="2685">The bridge stood on Wednesday evening Martin Keller, Gaby Pietzschmann and Sarah Gotzel.</seg>
<seg id="2686">The cellar presented the contents of the federal government programme "Social City," in which the renovations would then be carried out.</seg>
<seg id="2687">The core of the program is the revitalisation of inner cities, improving the living and working conditions and maintaining and expanding the infrastructure.</seg>
<seg id="2688">The measures would be carried out object-related, that is per property.</seg>
<seg id="2689">The refurbishment area would then finally be defined as a statute.</seg>
<seg id="2690">The funding period for the funding has been running since 1 January 2017 until 30 April 2026.</seg>
<seg id="2691">Until September this year, however, the survey will only be carried out, within the framework of which the participants in the rehabilitation area receive a questionnaire for filling out.</seg>
<seg id="2692">In November or December, the association will take place as soon as possible, so that the renovations can begin next year.</seg>
<seg id="2693">Afterwards, Pietzschmann explained that every Commune had to carry out the said preliminary investigations.</seg>
<seg id="2694">It is about evaluating the urban development issues and deciding when it is rehabilitated and to what extent.</seg>
<seg id="2695">For the particular property there will be a remark in the land register.</seg>
<seg id="2696">Pietzschmann will come after sensitivity even once more and make a picture of the situation, she promised.</seg>
<seg id="2697">Gotzel emphasised that a key success factor for the project was the participation of the participants.</seg>
<seg id="2698">Therefore, there will be questionnaires, which will be sent to the citizens in the coming weeks and completed by the end of the summer holidays.</seg>
<seg id="2699">The yellow questionnaire is the "building and property sheet," where it is possible, among other things, the structural condition and the reconstruction prospects.</seg>
<seg id="2700">In the grey questionnaire, the "household and apartment arch," data on size, distribution and residents of a residential area can be made.</seg>
<seg id="2701">The blue "bow" can only be filled if business premises are operated in the building.</seg>
<seg id="2702">However, it should be noted that Gotzel pointed out that a completed questionnaire was not at the same time an application for funding.</seg>
<seg id="2703">Furthermore, new construction measures are not eligible.</seg>
<seg id="2704">Schindler still stressed that the distribution of funds in accordance with the "greyhound principle" works - who comes first, grinds first.</seg>
<seg id="2705">You can't reserve funds for later.</seg>
<seg id="2706">Finally, photos of the project "Location II" were shown to make the present a "tasty" renovation.</seg>

<seg id="2716">The green-white Sikorsky VH-3D, known as Marine One, when the president is on board, was the heart of the event on July 17th in the White House with American construction programs.</seg>

<seg id="2718">The helicopter, manufactured in Connecticut, was issued in addition to a Maine Yacht, a Wisconsin fireman car and a Mississippi fork-lift truck.</seg>
<seg id="2719">The White House military bureau demanded the presence of the helicopter in a fragmentary order or Frago, barely 36 hours before the helicopter landed on the South Lawn, according to the records of the Navy Helicopter Squadron One (HMX-1), the unit responsible for the operation of the helicopter.</seg>
<seg id="2720">"I just wanted you to be aware of it because it is such an unusual event with a high visibility," wrote the commander of the HMX-1 on the eve of the event to his superiors, the deputy commander of the aviation.</seg>
<seg id="2721">The message indicated that the helicopter arrived on July 17th at 7 o'clock in the morning on the South Lawn for the event at 3pm, and so long remained until the lawn was cleared between 18: 00 and 21: 00 this evening.</seg>
<seg id="2722">The note adds that if the departure from the White House is delayed, a second crew would be required for the return flight due to the limitation of the service hours.</seg>
<seg id="2723">The original flight crew was during the event with the helicopter, while the security personnel of the unit remained on the ground during the time.</seg>
<seg id="2724">From the records provided by TIME, it was not clear whether a second flight crew was ultimately required.</seg>
<seg id="2725">The Hatch Act forbids federal employees to use state property for political purposes.</seg>
<seg id="2726">Data sets indicate that HMX-1 has asked if the event could harm the destination.</seg>
<seg id="2727">"a question we asked was whether it was a violation of the Hatch acts and we were informed that this was not the case," the commander wrote.</seg>

<seg id="2731">At the event, the president gave an impetus for the reform of the health reform that was underway in the Senate and he propagated the efforts to curb governmental regulations.</seg>
<seg id="2732">The use of aircraft, known as Marine One or Air Force One, for politically advantageous purposes is hardly a new phenomenon.</seg>
<seg id="2733">Presidents are obliged to use them for the trip.</seg>

<seg id="2741">The White House said that tax payers took over the burden for none of the other props presented at the event.</seg>
<seg id="2742">A spokesman of Sikorsky said the company was not involved in setting up the helicopter on the South Lawn.</seg>
<seg id="2743">HMX-1 does not maintain budgetary records for the presidential flights, and it is difficult to determine the exact costs for the event.</seg>
<seg id="2744">According to the US Department of Defense for the fiscal year 2017, the DoD refunds rate for the VH-3D is 24.380 USD per hour.</seg>
<seg id="2745">Records of the unit recorded the flight time of the aircraft as 30 minutes from the home base of the Marine Corps Air Facility in Quantico in Virginia.</seg>
<seg id="2746">The White House argues that the actual cost of operation of the helicopter is far below this rate.</seg>

<seg id="2864">The side of La League may regret their interest in Marco Verratti</seg>
<seg id="2865">Paris Saint-Germain will not indulge in its persecution of Neymar, after giving an offer of £189 million to trigger its release clause, but have they warned Barcelona three years before the world record rush?</seg>
<seg id="2866">The sensational base has heated the transfer window in the summer, because the League 1 club is ready to break the world record by more than double the previous mark, whereby Paul Pogba returned to Manchester United in the past season for 89 million pounds.</seg>

<seg id="2869">But was the football world warned of the PSG president three years ago from this prospect?</seg>
<seg id="2870">When Manchester City was interested in the signing of Blaise Matuidi, Nasser Al-Khelaifi had a strict warning for every club that wanted to sign one of the best players of PSG.</seg>

<seg id="2888">Interview: "Domspatzen-report relieves Pope brother Georg Ratzinger"</seg>
<seg id="2889">The Regensburger Domspatzen-Report on the abuses is relieved by Pope brother Georg Ratzinger.</seg>
<seg id="2890">That means author and historian Michael Hesemann.</seg>
<seg id="2891">The final report on the abuse scandal at the Regensburger Domspatzen provides further discussions.</seg>
<seg id="2892">Christian Weisnder, spokesperson for the reform movement "We are Church," declared publishing to the German press agency, as expected by the former Regensburg bishop and today's Cardinal Gerhard Ludwig Müller, as well as by the Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger, the 93-year-old brother of the Pope Benedict XVI, an apology.</seg>
<seg id="2893">It would serve the prestige of the Catholic Church very much if Müller and Ratzinger would express their deep regret upon their own omissions or their false evaluation of the processes at that time.</seg>
<seg id="2894">The Vatican newspaper "Osservatore Romano," on the other hand, criticised the fact that reporting on violence was measured with "double standards."</seg>
<seg id="2895">With regard to the grips in Regensburg, nobody doubts that it is "shameful and shameful acts" that would have to be punished and prevented in the future; however, the "degree of media manipulation," the author Lucetta Scaraffia, historian and member of the national Italian Bioethics committee.</seg>
<seg id="2896">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "the habit of calling the Catholic Church as a source of all evil is already part of everyday experience and prepares the public opinion to keep it normal," "" "" "" "writes Scaraffia." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2897">Princess Gloria of Thurn und Taxis also spoke with the Bavarian Radio in an interview: "you love to go to the church and this is a devouring devour."</seg>
<seg id="2898">She also pointed out that "punches had been a normal educational means" in her youth, "to be done with cheeky children, as I was one."</seg>
<seg id="2899">They found it unfair to apply today's standards for earlier decades, as the world has changed.</seg>
<seg id="2900">In connection with reports on misuse cases, Pope brother Georg Ratzinger often appeared.</seg>
<seg id="2901">Completely wrong, author and historian Michael Hesemann, who wrote with Ratzinger the memory band "My brother of the Pope" (translated into 12 languages).</seg>
<seg id="2902">"I have to take care of Georg Ratzinger," says Hesemann, "because all this had nothing to do with him," he evaluates the results of the final report.</seg>
<seg id="2903">What exactly is in the 440-page report that the lawyer Ulrich Weber put forward with the Enlightenment by the Bistum Regensburg institution with the Enlightenment?</seg>
<seg id="2904">A total of 547 Regensburger Domspatzen were sexually abused between 1945 and the beginning of the 1990s "with high plausibility" victims of attacks, 67 domineties sexually abused.</seg>
<seg id="2905">In the final report, Georg Ratzinger, who worked in Regensburg from 1964 to 1994, says: "in summary, it can be said that by Domkapellmeister R. in many cases forms of physical and psychological violence have been applied.</seg>
<seg id="2906">Especially with high emotionality, the punishment for the students was also more violent.</seg>
<seg id="2907">In contrast to many other defendants, however, many victims estimated the general humanity of R. and, in numerous cases, even combine positive memories with it in numerous cases. "</seg>
<seg id="2908">In the interview, Hesemann explains why the final report on the misuse scandal in the Regensburger Domspatzen Georg Ratzinger relieved his mind.</seg>
<seg id="2909">Mr. Hünemann, the 440-page report on the "Incidents of Violence of Violence on Protective Foods at the Regensburger Domspatzen," is a contradictory picture of Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger.</seg>
<seg id="2910">On the one hand many students emphasize his "humanity."</seg>
<seg id="2911">On the other hand he also appears as a choleric and perfectionist, who became more tangible when a cathedral-record didn't bring top performance musically.</seg>
<seg id="2912">How do you evaluate this final report as a biographer?</seg>
<seg id="2913">Michael Hesemann: if you take the trouble and read the entire 440 pages long report from the front to the back, you have to ask yourself why the name Georg Ratzinger is in it at all.</seg>
<seg id="2914">He is just eight pages dedicated to him and he is clearly acquitted of any suspicion of complicity or complicity in the terrible cases of sexual abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2915">The excesses of violence in the pre-school also took place outside his sphere of action.</seg>
<seg id="2916">It is possible to reproach it at best, of which too late or first indications haven't taken seriously enough.</seg>
<seg id="2917">The gymnasium gymnasium on which he worked was felt by practically all those questioned - literally "redemption," "heaven" and "better world."</seg>
<seg id="2918">The vast majority of his students, Georg Ratzinger, also presents an excellent testimony, describing him as "warm-hearted," "sincere," "sincere," "competent," and "understanding," as extremely good-natured teachers who regularly supplied the boys with cakes, biscuits and candy and "always surrounded by grapes of children."</seg>
<seg id="2919">Only a minority complains about its perfectionism and its high emotionality, which led to rage eruptions.</seg>
<seg id="2920">That he did not only knead with chairs and threw the keyring on the floor, but also distributed earthen and too cheeky guys at the hair or ears, he has admitted years ago, deeply regretted and apologized for it.</seg>
<seg id="2921">It must be said, however, that such educational methods were widespread in the fragrant period, the 1960s and 1970s, in both parents and teachers.</seg>
<seg id="2922">Do you know such breeding methods?</seg>
<seg id="2923">Of course, I think every one of us who was born before 1968.</seg>
<seg id="2924">I also experienced this in a secular school, a state grammar school.</seg>
<seg id="2925">Compared to what is actually happening in this report, namely the horrible sexual abuse and the excesses of violence at the preschool, these are indeed bagatelles.</seg>
<seg id="2926">One wonders if it is not related to his fame and his role as a brother of Benedict XVI, that many media have just rushed to him.</seg>
<seg id="2927">Many who never understood him are still working diligently on the Bavarian pope.</seg>
<seg id="2928">But the truth is: the report relieves Georg Ratzinger in every way!</seg>
<seg id="2929">In the media, in connection with the report, a lot was reported on the subject of abuse at the Regensburger Domspatzen.</seg>
<seg id="2930">Is Georg Ratzinger in the final report also placed any involvement or co-wiseship with regard to sexual abuse?</seg>
<seg id="2931">Michael Hesemann: clearly no.</seg>
<seg id="2932">Not one of the 67 victims of sexual assault is claiming to have been entrusted to the Domkapellmeister.</seg>
<seg id="2933">Not even the parents were dedicated.</seg>
<seg id="2934">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "I have never dared to talk to my father or mother," "" "" "" "said one of those concerned," "" "" "" "It was very embarrassing to me." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2935">The real problem with the enlightenment of sexual abuse was, however, that most victims are silent.</seg>
<seg id="2936">If they did not even entrust themselves to parents and siblings, then certainly not a choir leader, who would have been a colleague of the perpetrators in a certain way professionally.</seg>
<seg id="2937">How do the students Ratzinger rate the role of Ratzinger's role in the event of abuse?</seg>
<seg id="2938">Michael Hesemann: a questionable disciple articulated it so: "regarding sexual abuse... I see... no case in which he (Georg Ratzinger) had timely knowledge and could have stopped the perpetrator.</seg>
<seg id="2939">I hold it... also for really absurd to assume that it is imputed to him... boys more intrusive or clearer or more likely to have opened than opposite their parents, dormitory managers, trust teachers etc.</seg>
<seg id="2940">That you talk to him about sex... unthinkable. "</seg>
<seg id="2941">"" "" "" "so the report concludes:" "" "" "" "that the students and / or their environment involved in the run-up could not be confirmed as part of the investigation." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2942">As for sexual abuse, Georg Ratzinger is thus acquitted of any complicity.</seg>
<seg id="2943">He cannot be accused of preventing him from being prevented or brought to an ad.</seg>
<seg id="2944">Therefore there is no reason to link his good name with these vile crimes, as happened in some cases.</seg>
<seg id="2945">In the media there was much of "excesses" in the Regensburger Domspatzen.</seg>
<seg id="2946">"" "" "" "in the report" "" "" "" "looking away" "" "" "" "the former domed master Georg Ratzinger is accused of" "" "" "" "omitting" "" "" "". "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2947">Does he have to live with this reproach?</seg>
<seg id="2948">Michael Hesemann: that's the big problem in reporting everything mixed and mixed up to a huge pineal of sexual abuse and violent excesses and somewhere in the middle of Georg Ratzinger.</seg>
<seg id="2949">But exactly that is again an abuse of the report.</seg>
<seg id="2950">It is separated cleanly: between the preschool and the gymnasium of the cathedral-cats, between sexual abuse and violence-excesses as well as, we say once, other allegations.</seg>
<seg id="2951">In addition, the report deals with incidents from the period since 1945, thus also from four decades, in which Georg Ratzinger was not a choir director of the cathedral-cats.</seg>
<seg id="2952">The whole horrible test pedagogy, the cases in which boys from sadistic teachers were literally harassed and maladjusted, and were terribly terrified, all took place at the pre-school in Etterzhausen and Pielenhofen, where really scandalous conditions have had to be ruled out.</seg>
<seg id="2953">But with them Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger had nothing to do, because he only had to face the boys when they were already on the cathedral skew gymnasium.</seg>
<seg id="2954">On the one hand, as most of the witnesses pointed out, the topic of "preschool" was taboo.</seg>
<seg id="2955">One was only happy to be able to escape and enjoyed the so much better treatment and for many even "paradisiac" states.</seg>
<seg id="2956">What was different from the gymnasium gymnasium?</seg>
<seg id="2957">Michael Hesemann: there was discipline, but no sadistic violence.</seg>
<seg id="2958">And this is also true for Georg Ratzinger, when the report concludes that "many victims appreciate the general humanity of R. and, in many cases, even combine positive memories with it in numerous cases."</seg>
<seg id="2959">Thus, at most, the accusation remains to have looked away.</seg>
<seg id="2960">However, in spite of all efforts, the report could only define two periods in which he was reported from the states at the preschool.</seg>
<seg id="2961">The first time in 1970 / 71, when he began to establish himself and from the events at a school where he was not working and was responsible (so the witness) didn't want to hear anything, and then only back in 1993.</seg>
<seg id="2962">Did Georg Ratzinger consistently lose ears in front of the states?</seg>
<seg id="2963">Michael Hesemann: no, because in 1989 he wrote a letter to the director of the dome gymnasium, which even reproduced the report.</seg>
<seg id="2964">"" "" "" "in this he points out that" "" "" "" "that in the pre-school, the punishment is still practised." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2965">He recommended urgent intervention in the face of the danger of negative press releases.</seg>
<seg id="2966">This was, of course, at a time when legal clarity had long been banned as criminal punishments in Bavaria too.</seg>
<seg id="2967">Before that, they were in a legal grey area, as each one of us know yet knows.</seg>
<seg id="2968">It was also difficult for him to assess where the persons concerned might be exaggerated or dramatized, and where really the permissible limit had been exceeded.</seg>
<seg id="2969">But you can't say that he'd always looked away.</seg>
<seg id="2970">This is simply not true.</seg>
<seg id="2971">It was only in 1980 that the capital punishment of schools was officially abolished in Bavaria.</seg>
<seg id="2972">Princess Gloria of Thurn und Taxis claimed that it was unfair to apply today's pedagogical standards to that time.</seg>
<seg id="2973">How do you see it?</seg>
<seg id="2974">Michael Hesemann: we historians talk about the "pitfall of anachronism," that is, the danger to evaluate the past according to today's moral standards.</seg>
<seg id="2975">The princess was right.</seg>
<seg id="2976">But this of course does not apply to sexual abuse, which was abominable at all times, and not for what has been banned in the pre-school of adversity and violence against innocent children's souls, that goes far beyond that at the time.</seg>
<seg id="2977">This is all very horrible and I am glad that it is finally being worked out.</seg>
<seg id="2978">But at the same time I have to put Georg Ratzinger in protection, because all that had nothing to do with him.</seg>
<seg id="2979">His means of disciplining and punishment, i.e., slavelling and pulling on the hair and ears, were widespread in the 1970s.</seg>
<seg id="2980">When physical punishment was then forbidden, he also strictly adhered to it.</seg>
<seg id="2981">What picture of his Regensburg time has Georg Ratzinger back in conversations with you for the book "My brother of the Pope?"</seg>
<seg id="2982">Was the subject of test penalty also included in the language?</seg>
<seg id="2983">Michael Hesemann: well, in the book it's about the life of his brother Joseph, so Pope Benedict XVI, tells from his perspective, that the Domspatzen only played a side role.</seg>
<seg id="2984">Nevertheless, I by no means spared that he had a stricter regiment there.</seg>
<seg id="2985">But even this must be said once: without this perfectionism, without the demand of unconditional discipline, it would hardly have been possible for him to form an institution of Weldrank, the true cultural ambassador of Europe and his musical tradition, which went on tour twice in the USA (1983 and 1987) and Japan (1988 and 1991).</seg>
<seg id="2986">With biscuits and candy alone, the unruly boys are no longer a big singer and stand in front of every success, regardless of what area, but always discipline, passion and self-overcoming.</seg>
<seg id="2987">What kind of people do you have experienced Georg Ratzinger during the conversations with her book?</seg>
<seg id="2988">Michael Hesemann: through the work on the book and beyond, I really got to know Georg Ratzinger and experience again and again as wonderful, humorous, basic-good, deep-believing and heart-good people, of which one cannot imagine that he could even hurt a fly.</seg>
<seg id="2989">I regularly get in touch with how many former domineties still keep contact with him 23 years after his retirement, visit him, visit him - he is almost blind - and treat him like a member of her family.</seg>
<seg id="2990">Those who have not forgiven him until today are clearly in the minority.</seg>
<seg id="2991">Today, most of the cathedral-cats are grateful to him that he enriches their lives and has taught them the world of music.</seg>
<seg id="2992">And that he is always a good, fatherly teacher - a strict father, certainly, that may be - but also a lovely respectful person, to which they still look up and glorify them today.</seg>
<seg id="2993">And please, again quite clearly: all you submit to him are educational methods that were on the agenda at that time.</seg>
<seg id="2994">We can be glad that we have long overcome this time.</seg>
<seg id="2995">But it is most unjust, a man just because he is prominent and has a more prominent brother to go to the medial scapegoat.</seg>
<seg id="2996">There is only too obvious the evil intent that is behind it.</seg>
<seg id="2997">For the report that has just been published relieves him.</seg>
<seg id="2998">Now the state would command a 93-year-old man who acquired great merits and without the outside of Bavaria and perhaps Germany probably nobody would know the Regensburger Domspatzen, finally to leave in peace.</seg>
