28 @-@ year @-@ old chef in San Francisco Mall found dead
a 28 @-@ year @-@ old chef who recently moved to San Francisco was found dead in the staircase of a local shopping centre .
the victim &apos;s brother said he could not imagine anyone who would harm him , &quot; Fin@@ ally , he went up with him again . &quot;
the corp@@ se found on Wednesday morning in the West@@ field Mall was identified as the 28 @-@ year @-@ old Frank Gali@@ cia from San Francisco , divided the medical department in San Francisco .
the San Francisco Police Department said death was classified as murder and the investigation was ongoing .
the brother of the victim , Louis Gali@@ cia , told the ABS transmitter K@@ GO in San Francisco that Frank , who used to work as a cook in Boston earlier than six months ago , took his dream job as a cook in the S@@ ons &amp; Dau@@ ghters Restaurant in San Francisco six months ago .
a spokes@@ man for the S@@ ons &amp; Dau@@ ghters said that they were &quot; shocked and destroyed on the ground . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are a small team that works like a close family and we will miss him pain@@ fully , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the speaker . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
our thoughts and con@@ dol@@ ences are in this difficult time with Fran@@ ks &apos;s family and friends .
Louis Gali@@ cia admitted that Frank lived first in host@@ els , but that &quot; things for him finally went uphill . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he found an apartment , he had a girlfriend , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; told Louis Gar@@ cia K@@ GO . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Louis Gali@@ cia said he couldn &apos;t imagine anyone wanting to hurt his younger brother .
he was a friendly person with a big heart .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; his way of connecting with his family was to cook us a bit , prepare dinner , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Louis Gali@@ cia . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he never wanted to participate in any kind of dispute .
he was the brother who sw@@ am with the river .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with everything that goes wrong in the world , he was this un@@ polished diamond that brigh@@ tened every day , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
anyone who has information about the case will be asked to call the waiting list of the S@@ F@@ PD under the number 4@@ 15 @-@ 5@@ 75 @-@ 44@@ 44 .
J@@ enni@@ fer Ani@@ ston : I &apos;m always put into drawers
J@@ enni@@ fer Ani@@ ston does not always have to be perfect or successful .
the Hollywood star has made it clear in an interview now .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m always stuck in drawers or stuck from outside labels that have little to do with me and reality . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I myself do not wish to be always perfect and successful . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; to be honest , these things are rather dum@@ b . &quot;
J@@ enni@@ fer Ani@@ ston ( 47 ) can only laugh about it as &quot; Miss Perfect , &quot; as explained in the &quot; Cos@@ m@@ opol@@ itan . &quot;
the act@@ ress likes to spend her time at home , in front of the television with lo@@ cker@@ ish de@@ bris and Mexican food , it is said in the magazine .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we women don &apos;t have to be married or have children to be perfect , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the Hollywood star . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in her new film &quot; Mother &apos;s Day - Love is not a child &apos;s play &quot; Ani@@ ston is a single mother of two sons .

gol@@ fer Lan@@ ger receives the sports pyramid
his experiences on the horse are man@@ a@@ geable .
at the end of a golf tournament in South Africa Bernhard Lan@@ ger with some colleagues sought a bit of di@@ version with a ride on the beach .
for the 58 @-@ year @-@ old it was a premiere .
CH@@ IO : &quot; golden age pyramid &quot; for Bernhard Lan@@ ger
after a few minutes , the horses remembered their holiday , they hun@@ ted at home in the fast gal@@ lo@@ p .
one kilometer at this pace , I was afraid .
&quot; it was not a good experience , &quot; Lan@@ ger says .
and then the riding career ended up again .
on Saturday , Germany &apos;s best gol@@ fer was - 101 tournament wins - again near horses .
he let himself guide himself with his family over the plant of the AL@@ RV , on a horse he did not shoot himself for photo purposes .
long was the first time in Aachen and with it also at CH@@ IO .
the reason was quite convincing .
the German Spor@@ thilfe was handed over to the man from An@@ hausen in the course of a small gala , the Golden Sports Py@@ ramid .
there is no lack of acc@@ ol@@ ades to the symp@@ a@@ thetic ath@@ lete .
Federal Cross of Mer@@ it , Silver bay leaf , champi@@ ons tour player of the year ...
even the British Queen has already ad@@ ored him .
the 18th winner of the sports pyramid is long .
in Aachen he met the first winner Hans Günter Win@@ kler on Saturday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this award means a lot to me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Lan@@ ger , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because it is not only awarded for sporting achievements but also for social commitment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Lan@@ ger has been promoting young talent for decades .
and so he also offered the prize money of 25,000 euros .
with 15 other outstanding athletes , the two @-@ time US master winner was admitted to the &quot; Hall of F@@ ame of German Sports &quot; on Saturday .
the winners include the athletes of Hart@@ wig Gau@@ der and Harald Schmit@@ t , the winner Corn@@ elia Han@@ isch , Alexander P@@ usch and Ar@@ nd Schmit@@ t , the Ru@@ derer Peter @-@ Michael Kol@@ be , Bob @-@ driver Mein@@ hard N@@ eh@@ mer , the Ju@@ do@@ ka Frank Wi@@ en@@ e@@ ke , the jum@@ per of Al@@ win Scho@@ cker &apos;s öh@@ le and pos@@ th@@ um the Hand@@ b@@ aller Er@@ hard Wunder@@ lich .
many of these sports grounds arrived in Aachen on Saturday .
after the official part , the illustri@@ ous company moved to the Spring@@ stadium , where the Lav@@ azza Prize was running .
Bernhard Lan@@ ger kept distance to the big animals .
compare clinics and tr@@ um@@ ps economic policies compared to IT &apos;s all about the money
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; invest in infrastructure and prevent T@@ TP trade agreement - that &apos;s both Clinton and Tr@@ ump . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , the two US presidential candidates are in the tax and energy policy as well as in a fundamental issue .
the difference in economic policy between Donald Tr@@ ump and H@@ illary Clinton is a fundamental , rather philosophical difference .
on the role of the state .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Tr@@ ump wants to keep the doubts rather small and warns against how the state can harm the economy - with taxes and regulations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Clinton wants to tax the economy to death and regulate it to death , he says .
he himself , on the other hand , would be quite different , claiming Tr@@ ump .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he will drive back regulations massi@@ vely , and he is strong for a far @-@ reaching tax reform with lower tax rates - for private people and for businesses . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Clinton , on the other hand , says : the state has to fulfil certain tasks , it has dis@@ advant@@ aged opportunities to open up and needs money for it .
that is why taxes are increased for the rich , she says .
interest@@ ingly , both are very close to the topic infrastructure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need to invest in that , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Tr@@ ump and Clinton said almost verb@@ ati@@ m . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the democratic applicant announces the biggest investment in new jobs since World War II . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
state investment programs in the infrastructure are classic democratic politics and are strictly rejected by the state @-@ critical wing of the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans .
so on Tr@@ ump we could still deal with party @-@ internal discussions .
the differences in energy and climate policy are more evident .
Tr@@ ump wants to build coal @-@ fired power plants and drive coal mining in the US again .
oil production should also be possible in previously protected areas , the Paris climate protection agreement wants to cancel it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Clinton , on the other hand , wants to explicitly extend the renewable energies with its investment program : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a country will become the super power of clean energy and create millions jobs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it will be either China , Germany or America - I want we to be . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but not only in the infrastructure - even in international trade agreements , the two competitors are not too far apart from each other .
T@@ PP , the tran@@ spa@@ zi@@ lian trade agreement , do not want to sign both .
at the same time , both want to isol@@ ate the US from international trade - rather than simply protect American jobs .
they should be paid even better , says Clinton .
the present minimum wage of 7.@@ 25 US dollars is a wage of hunger .
it wants to raise it to $ 15 per hour .
what tr@@ ump wants to do in this question is not quite clear : once he says : the minimum wage must rise , then he says he must not be changed .
but the big discussion of the coming months would probably be more likely to develop the tax policy of the two camps .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the one hand is Tr@@ ump , who wants to relieve the economy and citizens to boost growth . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his critics asser@@ t him that the budget deficit would only be greater .
on the other hand , Clinton , who wants at least from the rich , wants to pay more taxes , and their critics say : more taxes are not the solution either .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; flight : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; every escaped woman has experiences with sexual violence &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
sexual violence is almost part of everyday life for women who are fle@@ eing alone .
when they arrive in Germany , they are often trau@@ mati@@ zed .
a house offers refuge .
there are four women sitting in a large kitchen .
each one has a baby , which is at most a year old .
one has put her little son in his arm .
he looks curi@@ ously in the room with big eyes .
his mother star@@ es at the table @-@ top .
until she notices that she is being watched .
she sm@@ iles short and kis@@ ses the little ones .
the scene seems normal .
until one speaks with Kat@@ rin B@@ ahr .
she is the Executive Director of Con@@ dro@@ bs , a carrier for social assistance in Bavaria , and deals among other things with the issue of women on the run .
the four women in the kitchen are P@@ oultry .
they live in the north of Munich in one of the few de@@ central accommodations for women and their children in Bavaria .
in January , Con@@ dro@@ bs opened up the facility together with Pro Famili@@ a and the Munich Frau@@ enh@@ ilfe .
recently it was officially opened .
60 people live there - about 40 women and 20 children .
there are no men - not even as visitors .
the exception is a guard in front of the door .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is not exagger@@ ated to say : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; every woman who arrives here has made experiences with sexual violence on her flight , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; B@@ ahr . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; men flee because of wars because they are persecuted politically because they thre@@ aten torture or death or because their families send them to Europe as a hope . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in women other reasons out@@ weigh : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many steal away secretly , because they don &apos;t see any other way out . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in their homeland , they have had experience with sexual violence , forced marri@@ ages , honour mor@@ als , slavery or forced pro@@ stitution .
that drives them away .
the flight continues on the run .
&quot; that tu@@ gs for example require a sexual act for a bottle of water is not a r@@ arity , &quot; says B@@ ahr .
and the women are alone , they are not protected by their families .
those who believe that the end , as soon as they come in Germany , ir@@ re , tells B@@ ahr .
here too , single women in refugee camps would often be considered inferior and worst ab@@ used .
this means that approximately 90 percent of women who live in the accommodation in the north of Munich are trau@@ mati@@ zed , they appreciate .
&quot; some of the children are certainly not born voluntarily . &quot;
many women are used to say nothing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or they dare not speak openly about what they have experienced because the shame is too big . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
since they often don &apos;t know how to help , more accommodation is needed only for them , requires B@@ ahr .
in Bavaria , the seven district governments are responsible for the accommodation of refugees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to the question of whether they knew from a similar project as in Munich in their competence area , some answers with no . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the Upper Pal@@ at@@ inate and Upper Fran@@ con@@ ia , for example , there is no such thing in government accommodation .
even in Sw@@ ab@@ ia alone , fle@@ dged women are not accommodated separately , says Karl @-@ Heinz Meyer , press spokesperson for the government .
in Upper Bavaria , Lower and Central Fran@@ con@@ ia there are stor@@ eys or private houses only for single women and their children .
the exception is Lower Bavaria , there are two central accommodation for women exclusively .
the committee &quot; Rights of Women and Gender E@@ quality &quot; in the European Parliament is also calling for women to stay separated from men .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a study published for the committee , it says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is very important that men and women should be accommodated separately . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; lack of privacy or is housed together with men and women , it can become - ongoing - violence against women . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
most importantly , the wash@@ rooms should be separated and easily accessible for women .
how much the women feel this need of protection can be read out by the cr@@ ush that exists in the house in Munich .
&quot; since it has been around for us , we have a long waiting list , &quot; B@@ ahr .
one could easily open a second house .
general practitioners strike : demands for new combat measures
representatives of the assistance physicians have called on their union to appro@@ ve new combat measures in their disputes concerning a new contract .
the Junior Doc@@ tors Committee ( J@@ DC ) of the British Medical Association ( BM@@ A ) has called for its entire Council to appro@@ ve more work combat measures starting from the beginning of September .
the J@@ DC said that ministers had agreed to deal with the concerns regarding the contract .
in July , assistance physicians and medical students agreed on the refusal of a contract that was agreed with the BM@@ A .
it was rejected by 58 % of its members voted in elections .
in a letter to the members who were published on Twitter on Thursday evening , the chairman of the J@@ DC Ellen Mc@@ Court said that the government was &quot; persist@@ ently calm &quot; to problems , leading to the fact that the treaty was rejected .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in view of this , the J@@ DC Board has agreed to completely reject the proposed new treaty and demand official new negotiations for all the concerns . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in response to the silence of the government , the J@@ DC Executive Board today submitted a formal request to a special meeting of the BM@@ A Council to appro@@ ve a running programme of escal@@ ating work combat measures starting at the beginning of September .
the disputes led to the fact that resident doctors went six times this year , the first total failures in the history of the N@@ HS .
the head of the BM@@ A assistance physicians Dr. Johann Mal@@ aw@@ ana came back after the election to reject the agreed contractual conditions that were recommended by the BM@@ A .
he shared BM@@ A members during the meetings , which took place before the vote by 5@@ 4,000 assistance physicians and medical students , stating that the contract should be advantageous and adopted .
after the vote , the Minister of Health , Jerem@@ y Hun@@ t , said that the contract for doctors in England would be forci@@ bly introduced .
Russia and Turkey : an &quot; alliance of out@@ si@@ ders &quot; ?
it was a gesture that ended a crisis .
the leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to surrender their hands and to announce the official end of the eight @-@ month war of words and economic sanctions .
but when Vladimir Putin receives his Turkish counterpart in the gil@@ ded hall of St. Petersburg Palace , I cannot deny the impression that Ankara will most want this reconciliation .
there was a hand@@ shake , yes .
but Putin &apos;s smile was sli@@ pper@@ y and he radi@@ ated hardly any heat , even for his restra@@ ined circumstances .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Rec@@ ep Tay@@ y@@ ip Erdo@@ gan , on the other hand , spoke of his &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; dear friend &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Putin , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to a report , five times . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I couldn &apos;t count it any more .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he also promised that relations with Russia would not only return to its old level before the crisis , but can even be improved . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the next day , a newspaper wrote that Erdo@@ gan had beha@@ ved as if something bad had never happened .
to me , his enthusiasm seemed to suggest the opposite .
but one of Putin &apos;s radiant , sustainable cool@@ ness showed that Russia &apos;s head of state had forgotten nothing .
rather , the cause of the crisis was the first thing he mentioned in his introduc@@ tory words : the snapshot of a Russian fighter plane on the Syrian border through Turkey .
Moscow &apos;s reaction to the time was kind@@ led .
Putin den@@ ounced and accused Ankara of having fallen into the back of Russia .
the off@@ ence was even greater since it was committed by a supposed friend .
building the c@@ ous@@ ins again becomes difficult , if not even impossible .
public opinion in Russia has changed since November .
for months , state @-@ controlled media held a violent , un@@ restricted attack on Ankara .
at one time it seemed as if the Turks were to blame for everything .
most serious were the accus@@ ations of senior officials that Erdo@@ gan &apos;s own family would have benefited from illegal oil trade in Syria , controlled by the so @-@ called Islamic State .
he denied this v@@ ehem@@ ently .
but in St.@@ Petersburg the official message was that it was time to look forward .
finally , this meeting was held only because Putin received the excuse from President Erdo@@ gan that he wanted to hear .
Russia could claim a kind of victory .
for Ankara , the advantages of a ce@@ ase@@ fire are obvious .
Erdo@@ gan mainly needs all the friends he can get after he has been reli@@ eved of his ministry last month in a failed coup d &quot; é@@ tat .
repeated terrorist attacks on Turkey have also shocked him .
but there are also economic motives .
Russian sanctions have hit Turkey hard - in particular the ban on charter flights that usually bring several million Russian tourists to the Turkish coast every year .
the number decreased by almost 90 % .
in Russia tour operators and charter companies will be reli@@ eved when flights are resum@@ ed .
they are based on a late seasonal storm on the Mediterranean Sea .
this week , the State TV forecast cheap fruit and vegetables as soon as the Turkish agricultural imports are allowed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a report in Ve@@ dem@@ sti put it as follows : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tourists there long , tomatoes here long . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the visit had an additional political value for Moscow .
Ankara is angry with the West as it regards its reaction to the attempted tak@@ eover of power as a weak answer .
in addition , the ongoing res@@ ent@@ ment on the sn@@ ail pace of EU accession negotiations and Putin , which is eager to benefit from the cool mood and to l@@ essen the relationship between Turkey and the West .
the Russian head of state won in Ankara a bonus that he called for support for the elected state organs after the attempted coup d &quot; é@@ tat .
this is a matter of course for Moscow , which itself has a profound fear of regime change .
the summit in this glorious palace on the sea enabled Russia and Turkey to show how an analy@@ st once described an &quot; alliance of out@@ si@@ ders &quot; : two countries that have rejected and treated themselves badly by the West and are now al@@ lied with .
nevertheless , despite public reconciliation , there are still big differences between the two .
the biggest difference is Syria , where Moscow has recently given its role as a peac@@ emaker , but where Russia and Turkey support opposing sides .
it could be significant that after almost three hours of initial talks , both pres@@ idents said at the press conference that they did not even take the subject .
the President of Turkey deliberately avoided answering a question about their differences , while Putin chose to emphasize this .
there is no clear consensus on where a common denom@@ in@@ ator can be found in Syria .
but after months of open hos@@ tilities - and in the face of the potential for a perfect disaster when NATO member Turkey fired the Russian fighter jet - it is certainly better that the two He@@ ads of State at least talk to each other again .
Royal Bank of Scotland is no longer available for clients outside of Scotland
according to the Bank &apos;s CEO , the R@@ BS label is only to be reduced to a back office role .
the Royal Bank of Scotland will no longer be available for customers outside of Scotland .
Ross Mc@@ E@@ wan announced the BBC Scotland that R@@ BS was associated with the Bank &apos;s global ambi@@ tions .
since then , the Bank has dist@@ anced itself from being almost collap@@ sed and rescu@@ ed eight years ago .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in this period , brand strate@@ gi@@ sts &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; R@@ BS &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; have used to protect other end @-@ consumer finance brands . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
she supported the international sport with millions of pounds of sponsor@@ ship , from the Six Nations Ru@@ g@@ by to Wim@@ ble@@ don winner Andy Mur@@ ray .
but now it has decided to focus more on national brands .
the Royal Bank of Scotland will only be available to customers in Scotland , but will not be initi@@ alized .
in England and Wales , all RS@@ B references , the decentr@@ alised head@@ quarter and the stock market listing to Nat@@ West will change .
the brand Ul@@ ster Bank is already used for customers in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland .
there are other , smaller brands for private customer business that will receive more importance - C@@ out@@ ts , Adam &amp; Co , Dr@@ um@@ mond and Hol@@ t &apos;s Military Bank .
Mc@@ E@@ wan was inter@@ viewed during a viewing tour of clients and employees in In@@ ver@@ ness @-@ shire .
he divided the BBC Scotland with : &quot; the brand RS@@ B becomes our brand of investors as well as the brand under which our employees will be employed , as we are now becoming more of a bank of brands . &quot;
when the Bank itself became a global brand , R@@ BS became a global brand .
now I say that we do not pursue global goals , but local goals .
each of these brands will stand in their own congregations for something completely different and our employees will work with the customers among these brands .
R@@ BS has already stated that it will not continue its Six Nations Sponsor@@ ship and that it will increase the percep@@ ti@@ bility of the various brands in its sports sponsor@@ ship .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is time for us to develop into the Bank of brands , because how do we concentrate inside ( we asked ) to make this a better bank for customers ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the CEO . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it would have been very cy@@ ni@@ cal three years ago if we had said that we would be a great bank for our customers and would have launched these brands .
but with our work , the focus on customer needs and not our own , I think , you will see many changes .
we can re @-@ launch these brands , so I think the time has come .

he set a milestone on Pre@@ dil@@ ection , trained by John Gos@@ den , on his local rac@@ et@@ rack with his second win of the night .
the 45 @-@ year @-@ old Italian is the sixth jo@@ ckey who reaches the milestone in the flat race .
he succ@@ eeds Sir Gordon Rich@@ ards , Dou@@ g Smith , L@@ ester Pig@@ got@@ t , P@@ at Ed@@ dry and Wil@@ lie Car@@ son .
the triple winner D@@ ett@@ ori who won in front of G@@ ha@@ y@@ ar said : &quot; it &apos;s something special . &quot;
I &apos;m very emotional because my family is here too
I am very happy that it has happened in New@@ market because I ended up here 30 years ago .
it &apos;s not a big meeting , it &apos;s not Royal As@@ cot - it &apos;s a ban@@ al Friday evening with 20,000 people .
I am reli@@ eved and very humble .
D@@ ett@@ ori pi@@ cks up the che@@ ering when he re@@ covers the victory on dil@@ ection
two jo@@ ckey players reached the milestone in the obstacle race - Jo@@ ckey Richard Johnson and the retired 20 @-@ time winner Sir Anthony Mc@@ Co@@ y who achieved more than 4,@@ 300 victories in a record breaking career .
L@@ ester Pig@@ got@@ t , the nine @-@ time Der@@ by@@ si@@ eger has 4,@@ 4@@ 93 career jumps
Frank@@ ie is one of the best jo@@ ckey of the modern and it is no surprise that he reached this milestone , which only a few have achieved before him .
he has style and is strong , but it is his tac@@ tical intell@@ ect , which differs from the others in the weight control room .
he is a fantastic ambassador for races , his enthusiasm and charis@@ ma thri@@ lled fans for this kind of sport for years .
I told Frank@@ ie a few weeks ago at Ep@@ som that he had already gotten 6,000 gains if he was not just a weekend and big tournament jo@@ ckey !
Frank@@ ie has already suffered nearly 30 years of winners in the UK , which is great .
he has a living personality , which is good for a British race , but in addition he is an unbelievable jo@@ ckey .
Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori celebrated the milestone with a typical Flying Dis@@ mount
from Flying Fin@@ ishes to Flying Dis@@ moun@@ ts , Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori has been the flagship of the British flat race for two decades .
it was nerve wre@@ cking .
a whole series of major tournaments , including his famous Gl@@ orious Seven , 1996 at As@@ cot , but he also survived a plane crash and received a prohibition of drugs .
three years ago he had difficulties when he returned from his six month lock , but he showed an impressive characteristic strength to def@@ y his doub@@ ters and return to his best .
and he is not yet at the end - D@@ ett@@ ori once said that he wants to continue with competitions up to at least 5@@ 0.@@ ten years of age .
Russian Putin hum@@ idi@@ fies chief of staff Serge@@ i Ivan@@ ov
Russian President Vladimir Putin has un@@ expect@@ edly dismissed his chief of staff Serge@@ i Ivan@@ ov .
IV@@ AN@@ O@@ V was part of Putin &apos;s tigh@@ test confidence many years .
the 63 @-@ year @-@ old was appointed Special Repres@@ entative for Environment and Transport Affairs .
in a statement by the Krem@@ lin it reads that without stating reasons &quot; Putin ordered the dis@@ miss@@ al of Ivan@@ ovo from his duties as chairman of the Russian presidential administration . &quot;
Anton V@@ ain@@ o , who had been his deputy since 2012 , has been appointed to his successor .
V@@ ain@@ o , 44 , is a former diplom@@ at .
born in Tall@@ inn , Estonia , in 1972 , he graduated from the prestigious State Moscow Institute for International Relations ( M@@ G@@ IMO ) and worked in the Tokyo embassy .
on the website of the Krem@@ lin , it is called ( in Russian ) that he later was the chief manager and chief of staff of the regi@@ stra@@ r .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said to Putin about his appointment : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thank you for your confidence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I think it is the most important task of the government to support your activity as Head of State on bills of law and controls to implement your instructions .
Putin told the Russian TV station on Friday that Ivan@@ ov asked to leave his post and V@@ ain@@ o recommended it as his successor .
are the smiling faces convincing ?
this step has made Moscow mysti@@ cal .
Serge@@ i Ivan@@ ov was a long time one of the closest familiar Vladimir Putin and works like him for the Soviet secret service , the K@@ GB .
he was one of the most powerful men in the country .
at a meeting with President Putin , which was broad@@ cast@@ ed on television , both men asser@@ ted that the chief of staff res@@ ig@@ ned upon their own request .
but despite the smile for the cameras , only a few of them are convinced - especially now , just before the parliamentary elections .
so is the result of a kind of power struggle ?
nobody knows that at the moment .
but the official asser@@ tion that a man who once was tou@@ ted as a potential president ought to once again lead the Russian environmental policy - pushed to great skep@@ ticism .
in his remarks to Putin cited on the Krem@@ lin &apos;s website , Ivan@@ ov said &quot; It is true that I asked you in a conversation at the beginning of 2012 , to me this very complicated post - you could almost say - ar@@ resting post for four years .
as it turns out , I have been chairman of the Russian presidential administration for four years and eight months .
IV@@ AN@@ O@@ V took up the post in December 2011 .
previously , he was Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defence .
he is a member of the Russian Security Council and , like Putin , former member of the State Security Service K@@ GB .
in the late 1990s , when Putin was President of the Federal Security Service ( FS@@ B ) , who replaced the K@@ GB , Ivan@@ ov was appointed his deputy .
when Putin came to power , he called Ivan@@ ov one of the five people he trusted most .
it was once believed that after Putin &apos;s second term , Ivan@@ ov could become president of Russia , as a third term of Putin had viol@@ ated the constitution .
but this post was taken by another close ally of Putin , D@@ mit@@ ry Med@@ ve@@ dev .
Putin became prime minister before he became President three and a half years later .
criminal Min@@ ds Star Thomas Gib@@ son fired after he hit producers
Gib@@ son was involved in a physical examination on the set of the series in Los Angeles last month .
ABC studios and C@@ BS Television Studios that produce the series announced his dis@@ miss@@ al in a joint statement .
Gib@@ son , who played the special agent Aaron Hot@@ chner , publicly ap@@ ologi@@ zed on Thursday before the announcement of his dis@@ miss@@ al .
on the set there were artistic differences and a dis@@ agreement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I regret the incident , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in a message . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
details on how the character of Gib@@ sons comes out of the series , which follows a team of FB@@ I agents , is expected to be published at a later stage according to ABC studios and C@@ BS Television Studios .
the 54 @-@ year @-@ old , who previously played in the Sit@@ com D@@ har@@ ma &amp; Gre@@ g , has been with him since the first season of the series in 2005 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I love record Min@@ ds and put my whole blood blood in the last twelve years , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gib@@ son in a message published on Friday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I had hoped to be there until the end , but that won &apos;t be possible anymore .
I would like to thank the authors , producers , actors , our wonderful crew and especially the best fans you can only wish for a series .
the planned broadcasting of the twel@@ fth relay is scheduled for September 28 .
ri@@ dd@@ les for fish that landed in the garden in Ban@@ ff
an inhabit@@ ant of Ban@@ ff called for help in identifying the fish that appeared in his garden in Ban@@ ff .
Kevin B@@ ain thinks it could deal with the 75 fish around Sand@@ a@@ ale , which were sa@@ vor@@ ed by a fountain .
Mr. B@@ ain , who lives about 500 meters from the sea , published a video of the spectacle on Per@@ is@@ cope in the hope that someone could shed some light on the appearance of the two inches long fish .
Que@@ ens@@ land Crossing : bridge now connected with Fi@@ fe
the £ 1.@@ 35 billion project is to be completed by May 2017
engineers have connected the northern deck of Que@@ ens@@ land cross@@ ings to the vi@@ a@@ duct - which means that the bridge is now connected with fi@@ fe .
it is the first of four closures of the &quot; ceiling b@@ lower &quot; that approach the completion around each of the three towers of the bridge .
the bridge of Fi@@ fe is now 600 metres long and weighs 30,000 tonnes .
it has 10,000 tons of steel and 20,000 tons of concrete and 46 be@@ vel cables .
the £ 1.@@ 35 billion project is to be completed by May 2017 .
business Minister Keith Brown visited the construction site today and was one of the first to go from the country to the bridge .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; This is a historic and symbolic moment during the construction of the Que@@ ens@@ land cross@@ ings . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we are all witnesses of an engineering art of a truly epic scale in this project with over 30,000 tons of concrete and steel used alone for this part of the bridge .
despite the massive size and weight of the bridge , the completion of the connection between the vi@@ a@@ duct and the bridge deck is a delicate activity that requires extremely precise tolerances for fit .
in total , almost 79 % of the total bridge de@@ cks in their place and the last section of the deck now gets a concrete shot in Ros@@ y@@ th for the deck , which means that the entire deck is ready to be lifted on the bridge to its place .
Michael Martin , Project Manager of For@@ th Crossing Bridge Con@@ struc@@ tors , said : &quot; the first closure is a significant milestone in each bridge project .
with this fantastic project , the closure is future @-@ proof high @-@ rise and civil engineering .
after the installation of the last stretch of road and its connection with the north tower on the north , we had to close the existing gap in the north or the landing side .
this was achieved by pulling the northern feeder bridge 700 milli@@ meters to the south .
this was a massive and at the same time very delicate activity .
massive , since the vi@@ a@@ duct is 2@@ 22 metres long , weighs about 6,000 tons and has to be pulled upwards at an incl@@ ine of approx . 3 % .
unc@@ le , because the tolerances on which the team worked are tiny - on each side they were just a few milli@@ meters .
fortunately everything went very well .
rescue in the Mo@@ el@@ f@@ re Bay : three men are lucky enough to be alive &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; three men have &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; happiness &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after they were thrown off by their fishing boat in front of Angl@@ es@@ ey . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Mo@@ el@@ f@@ re R@@ N@@ LI life station hit Friday at 13 : 20 BS@@ T Alarm after a crew watched the event in Mo@@ el@@ f@@ re Bay .
the three men strug@@ gled to swim in safety while their boat moved on their own .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we saw how the boat turned around and presented us the worst , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the leader of the rescue station of Mo@@ el@@ f@@ re Vin@@ ce Jones . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fortunately the strong winds ble@@ w the boat out of its reach , until we left the water , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he added . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
two of the men were rescu@@ ed by a local fishing boat , while the third man was exhausted at the age of 60 and was found hanging on a bu@@ o@@ y without a life@@ jacket .
they all came aboard the shore rescue boat and were brought back to the rescue station
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mr Jones said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the three men thrown into the water are lucky and still alive . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
although the boat engine had an emergency stop , it loos@@ ened the boat from the person who ste@@ ered the boat .
someone watches over these men today .
seriously injured - man sticks to his ex @-@ girlfriend
a man attacked his ex @-@ girlfriend in Hamburg @-@ Har@@ burg with a knife and severely injured .
as the police informed yesterday , the 50 @-@ year @-@ old got the key to the apartment to get his personal things .
instead the alcohol @-@ zed perpetr@@ ator cut the clothes from his ex @-@ girlfriend .
when she came to the apartment , he stab@@ bed her twice .
the 44 @-@ year @-@ old was injured at the hand and the body .
the police arrested the perpetr@@ ator .
while the 50 @-@ year @-@ old destroyed his ex @-@ girlfriend &apos;s clothes , he called his mother .
this then al@@ er@@ ted his sister .
together with her partner , the 45 @-@ year @-@ old wanted to calm her brother .
but she could not move him to leave the apartment .
that is why she went out of the house with her partner .
on the street she met the ex @-@ partner of the man .
when the two women again entered the apartment , the 50 @-@ year @-@ old pushed his sister to the side and attacked his ex @-@ girlfriend .
who builds favourable apartments to Braunschweig ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the SPD and Gre@@ ens mean : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; investors should be taken much more seriously in the future . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
how can one react to the bad news that Braunschweig is losing nearly 1300 inexpensive apartments over the next few years ?
the SPD is propos@@ ing a &quot; housing concept living &quot; for the next session of the council .
but stri@@ fe is programmed .
first and foremost , the question is : who should actually build the cheap apartments ?
a regulation is missing so far .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said S &amp; D Group president Christoph Brat@@ mann : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we agree with the Gre@@ ens : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the future , those who want to build on urban areas must pay 20 percent of all apartments as social housing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the cheap apartments , however , can also arise in the continu@@ ance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , the great point of conten@@ tion in the town hall is , as Brat@@ mann says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how do you deal with investors who want to build on private land ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want investors to build at least 10 percent on such surfaces , but as much as 20 percent of the apartments as social housing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a new urban housing development program that will cost millions and still needs to be financed should provide incentives . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the problem , so Brat@@ mann says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is currently no agreement between the fac@@ tions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the CD@@ U wants to make investors as few as possible .
the left wants even tough@@ er print runs for investors .
despite this , as viol@@ a , a sharpen@@ ing of the situation on the housing market is emerging .
if the action concept is implemented , this will provide additional tasks in the building administration .
more staff is needed .
it is unclear whether we will get the skilled workers .
but the program is not entirely up @-@ to @-@ date : the approximately 12@@ 60 new apartments , which should be built anyway .
but how to compensate for the loss of some 1300 inexpensive apartments , whose funding will exp@@ ire over the next few years ?
by 2020 alone , there will be 500 apartments .
in order to prevent this , according to planning spokesperson Nicole Palm , pending ties should now be purchased from the city .
in addition , it would have to be re@@ thought to bring apartments back to the price binding .
this is possible in the western city .
the problem could be solved at one stroke .
because in the western city of the year @-@ end Fri@@ sten is running .
around 1800 apartments could be brought back to the price binding for cheap apartments .
only : this is what the owners , the housing associations , do not want .
because the number of social housing in the western city is drastically increased , one is away from the goal of so @-@ called mixing .
there should be no more concentration of socially dis@@ advant@@ aged neighbour@@ hoods in just a few districts .
the Gre@@ ens expect that there will be movement in the discussion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; vice @-@ president Holger Her@@ lit@@ sch@@ ke says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for a broad majority , the CD@@ U must go into the boat . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
although I concentrated on more building sites for single @-@ family homes .
but what does not mean that there can still be a compromise .
Pok@@ é@@ mon Go , a hunt for health and luck , which is worthwhile
it is fascinating to see how the world changes .
the fact that teenagers and children are no longer going outside , but rather prefer spending their spare time on screens has been lam@@ ented by many in the last decade .
Pok@@ emon Go is about getting people out of the sofa and getting more active .
the time on the screen was initially on the TV , then video games and finally limited to smartphones .
that &apos;s why it &apos;s great to see that technology and outdoor activities don &apos;t exclude each other .
of course I refer to the Pok@@ é@@ mon Go @-@ W@@ ahn , an app based on characters created first for video games in the 1990s ( later created a cartoon series , playing cards and other spin @-@ offs ) .
like many pop culture phenomena , the interest in the release of the game in the USA , Australia and New Zealand declined in early July .
the market launch in other countries was postpon@@ ed by the massive demand that the servers over@@ loaded .
within a few days , Pok@@ é@@ mon Go had more users than Tin@@ der and almost as many as Twitter .
how does it work ?
in short , players go outside with their smartphones and look for Pok@@ emon , which will be tra@@ cked with a GPS and , once found , &quot; photographed &quot; ( via a screen@@ shot on the mobile ) or &quot; captured . &quot;
a generation that played the game when she was younger , joined the W@@ ahn and j@@ umped for the search of the sofa .
in the US , the game led to a considerable increase in steps that put the average person back every day .
Cardi@@ ff , an Apple Watch app that tra@@ cked 35@@ ,000 users , recently announced that within two days of market launch , the number of people persecuted , who exercise every day 30 minutes , j@@ umped from 45 percent to 53 percent .
the company does not know who is playing Pok@@ é@@ mon Go - it only sees raw data to increase performance .
many public awareness campaigns on health that people want to take &quot; take 30 minutes &quot; to &quot; come off the sofa &quot; and &quot; be active every day &quot; hit deaf ears because many public messages are boring for health and come from people who look mis@@ erable .
nevertheless , the importance of sports cannot be over@@ valued .
anyone who drives sports regularly reduces his chances of suffering from cancer or depression .
physical activity helps in weight control , high blood pressure , diabetes and a long list of benefits that are too long to lead them here .
but the wonderful thing about Pok@@ é@@ mon Go is that it brings people to do something in the open that makes them fun .
three pillars of health are covered - movement , fresh air and sunshine as well as fun .
some people even close new friend@@ ships on the hunt .
as always there are also black@@ ish game spo@@ ons , who always have to complain about something .
and yes , someone could run against a door .
what should it do ?
a breakthrough occurred .
even if smartphone apps like Fit@@ bit were able to track up our activity earlier , they gave us no reason to play sports as this game does .
the new will lose its appeal and use it with time .
however , due to Pok@@ em@@ ons &apos;s success , there will be more games that will unite apps and virtual reality with the active ones in the real world and help many people on the hunt to be more active , f@@ itter and healthier .

Sim@@ one Bil@@ es Cre@@ ates Gold in Dam@@ ent@@ ur@@ ns
forget the pressure .
forget the hyp@@ e .
Sim@@ one Bil@@ es is immune to all of this .
dynamic on the jumping horse .
eff@@ or@@ tless on the beam .
breathtaking on the ground .
brilliant on whole line .
and now also Olympic champion .
the 19 @-@ year @-@ old American gymn@@ ast announced on Thursday for the title of the competition and enlarged the gap between himself and the rest of the world under the spotlight of the Olympic Games .
her total result of 6@@ 2,@@ 19@@ 8 was clearly ahead of the Silver Med@@ al winner and &quot; Final Five &quot; team mate A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man and the Russian bronze med@@ alist Ali@@ ya Must@@ afa .
the American women Sim@@ one Bil@@ es tur@@ nt on the balance beam during the individual campaign of women in the gymn@@ as@@ tics at the Olympic Summer Games in Rio de Janeiro 2016 , Brazil , Thursday .
Bil@@ a is the fourth h@@ eter@@ os@@ exual American woman who wins a title and overall the fifth while she consoli@@ dates her call to be the best of her generation or even at all .
she burst into tears when her final result was shown and her long journey at that moment found an end .
this success puts them in the same league as unique athletes , such as Michael P@@ helps , who brought their sports to new heights :
Bil@@ a has dominated the last three years , 15 world championship med@@ als - including 10 gold med@@ als - with so amazing exercises that include a mixture of ambition and precision that the Olympic champion of 1984 Mary Lo@@ u Res@@ cue from her said that she is &quot; the best gymn@@ ast I &apos;ve ever seen . &quot;
it awa@@ ited them with a final exam in Brazil , a competition not so much between Bil@@ es and the rest of the athletes , but rather between it and a load of over@@ sized expectations .
not returning with a handful of gold back to the family in Spring , Texas would be considered a disappointment .
Sim@@ one Bil@@ es , on the left , and A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man embrace each other , having won gold and silver in the single multi @-@ competition in@@ als of women at the Olympic Summer Games 2016 in Rio de Janeiro , Brazil , Thursday
Bil@@ a took the first medal on Tuesday , while she served as a clamation mark on the farewell celebration of the cre@@ mat@@ orial co @-@ ordin@@ ator Martha Kar@@ oly@@ i .
although it insi@@ sted that during its long journey to the top , never to have the future planned , it is not really true .
part of their ground exercises - which contain their typical Tum@@ bling Pass - is matched to Latin American music that would fit at home on the street outside the Olympia arena in Rio .
this is no coincidence .
this girl who was adopted as a small child by her grand@@ parents and discovered by trainer A@@ im@@ ee Bo@@ or@@ man &apos;s mother during a school flight into the gymn@@ asi@@ um in which Bo@@ or@@ man trained , became a force .
since the summer of 2013 , it has no longer lost any competition , a winning stre@@ ak that will last as long as it wishes .
even though Pat@@ af@@ ina led light through two turns , the image sli@@ pped .
Swedish bars and dental practices - in which Bil@@ lion holds the world title - l@@ ur@@ king .
she recovered again with 15.@@ 4@@ 33 on the balance beam again - and with a 15.@@ 9@@ 33 on the floor there was another one on it .
Ra@@ is@@ man gently embra@@ ced her when she expected her grand@@ son - a pure form@@ ality - and tears stre@@ amed on bil@@ es shiny red , white and blue eyel@@ iner , as the vision they once described in their collective book became a reality .
the achievement of Ra@@ is@@ mans was a ven@@ ge@@ ance for the last time four years ago when she fought for third place , but the bronze medal went to Must@@ afa in a Ti@@ eb@@ ra@@ ke .
this time the 22 @-@ year @-@ old team captain , called &quot; Grand@@ ma &quot; by the Americans , had a lead .
after her exercise , she threw the audience of K@@ us@@ sh@@ alls , overwhel@@ med by a com@@ eback , which sometimes seemed doub@@ t@@ ful .
as for Bal@@ es , the rapidly spreading T@@ we@@ et of the 19 @-@ year @-@ old has a completely new meaning from the beginning of this week :
police : 3 victims in serial kill@@ ings shot in the car when listening to music
according to police reports published on Thursday , two women and a 12 @-@ year old girl were shot who died in one of the dead@@ liest attacks since a decade in the first serial killer attack by Phoenix , while listening to the car and listening to music .
Angela Roch@@ elle Liner , Stefanie R. El@@ lis and El@@ lis daughter Mal@@ e@@ ah were shot on 12 June , while the car was par@@ ked in an entry , the authorities said .
the perpetr@@ ator fired eight shots from a fire@@ arm while he stood on the passenger side of the car and subsequently fled with another vehicle to read in the report .
the police said that the thre@@ ef@@ old murder did not seem to have been the result of a pre@@ dat@@ or , as the aggres@@ sor did not take the hand@@ bags or the $ 2,@@ 900 in possession of one of the adult victims .
the police spokes@@ man of Phoenix S@@ g@@ t. Jonathan Howard said that the sho@@ ot@@ ings lead the investig@@ ators to take a closer look at whether they are associated with four previous attacks .
altogether , seven people were killed in h@@ is@@ panic living quarters within four months in nine attacks and two injured .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it happens in a residential area in front of a house , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; told Howard the K@@ H@@ PO , a subsidiary of C@@ BS , beginning of the month . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is assumed that the susp@@ ects used several vehicles , including a brown N@@ iss@@ ans from the late 1990s , a black BMW from the late 1990s and a white Cadi@@ l@@ lac or Lincol@@ n .
investig@@ ators refused to expose the evidence that led them to the conclusion that the attacks were linked and committed by the same mur@@ derer .
El@@ lis , 33 , was hospit@@ alized due to her injuries and died later .
liner , 31 , and El@@ lis daughter Mal@@ e@@ ah died locally .
a witness told the police that it was not unusual for them to sit in a par@@ ked car and listen to music .
the authorities also published a police report on the shooting which ended half an hour before the three @-@ fold murder and assumed that it was the serial killer &apos;s work .
investig@@ ators found cartridge sleeves and secured a ball of the seat as well as ball fragments from the engine compartment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mother of a 6 year old with micro@@ cephal@@ y : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it will be better &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what is wrong at all -- of course , one has left behind it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
your husband Vincent and her have been told that Ed@@ mund may never be able to recognize her and that he may not even survive .
some doctors even went so far that they proposed to institution@@ alise him .
&quot; my first answer was &apos; I didn &apos;t know that people still do , &apos; said Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to .
Ed@@ mund can walk with the help of a walking aid .
Ed@@ mund was neither able to sit nor craw@@ l up to his third year of life nor can he still speak .
but he is slowly making progress .
it can run with support and cycle .
he also loves playing and singing with his two brothers .
Elizabeth shows the sign language Ed@@ mund presents for &quot; Please sing me a bit . &quot;
&quot; we bring a sign language to him , &quot; said Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to C@@ BS News .
but it is not a typical sign language -- she says . Ed@@ mund has invented some signs alone .
micro@@ cephal@@ y has a variety of causes : genetic such as Ed@@ mund and infection with viruses such as meas@@ les or ci@@ k@@ avi@@ rus during pregnancy .
the symptoms and forecasts can vary greatly .
it is still too early to say how it will affect the life of the ci@@ k@@ avi@@ rus infected .
Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to re@@ members the emotional price of a uncertain future .
I asked constantly , what will happen ?
what will happen ?
and she still doesn &apos;t know .
I have been asked no more about the pro@@ g@@ nosis for a long time , because I don &apos;t expect it to really tell me anyone .
but Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to has a promising advice for mothers of infants with birth defects caused by the ci@@ k@@ avi@@ rus .
it will be better .
you know it will be better for you .
you will love your child and your child will love you .
heavy ra@@ ins , floo@@ ding gives rise to ba@@ il@@ outs in Lou@@ isi@@ ana , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi
heavy rainf@@ alls and large @-@ scale floo@@ ding in Lou@@ isi@@ ana forced the governor to call out the emergency stand on Friday .
numerous rivers in the southeast of Lou@@ isi@@ ana and the south of the Miss@@ issi@@ ppi river flooded its banks and threatened with large floo@@ ding after extreme rainf@@ alls , reported the National Weather Service .
the governor of Lou@@ isi@@ ana John B@@ el Edwards said that state officials are in constant contact with local authorities and are already on their way to the affected communities .
Mike Ste@@ ele , a spokes@@ man for the Office of Hom@@ eland Security and Emer@@ gency Prepar@@ edness of the Govern@@ ors , announced that the requests for flood vessels , boats and sand bags were multiplied .
Ste@@ ele said that the municipality of Tan@@ gi@@ p@@ ah@@ oa alone claimed tens of thousands of sand bags .
a flood warning system is used across large parts in southern Lou@@ isi@@ ana to Saturday .
the weather forecast dropped that additional 3 to 5 inches may drop in this area .
in the south of Al@@ ab@@ ama there was a flood warning system on Friday , while it continued to rain in the Mobile area .
the River Com@@ ite close to Bat@@ on Rou@@ ges and the River Am@@ ite near Den@@ ham Springs , both located in Lou@@ isi@@ ana , will probably reach record levels over the weekend .
the met@@ er@@ e@@ ologist Ale@@ k Kr@@ aut@@ mann says that both rivers could flood many houses near the nearby Bat@@ on Rou@@ ge .
he also said that a downstream flood in Ascension Par@@ ish poses a danger , as these streams flow only slowly into Lake Mau@@ rep@@ as via the tro@@ dden rivers .
the river Ti@@ ck@@ fa@@ w , south of the Miss@@ issi@@ ppi state border in Liverpool , Lou@@ isi@@ ana , reached the highest level ever recorded on Friday at 09.@@ 00 .
rescue teams still plu@@ cked people out of the flood waters in the districts of Am@@ ite and Wil@@ kin@@ son in the southwest of Miss@@ issi@@ ppi .
L@@ ero@@ y H@@ ans@@ ford , his wife and his step@@ son were among those who were saved on Friday near Glo@@ be .
H@@ ans@@ ford , 62 , says that water from Be@@ aver Creek , which is normally more than 400 feet away from his house , has increased overnight .
he said that another step@@ son who lives nearby would have warned him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we woke up and the water flow@@ ed and poured in , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; H@@ ans@@ ford said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it reached my waist .
his wife said H@@ ans@@ ford had never seen such a high level of river in the 48 years she lived there .
H@@ ans@@ ford said he and his family members had all the han@@ di@@ caps and he was the only one who can swim .
H@@ ans@@ ford said that No@@ thel@@ fer had saved all three in a large military truck and would have brought them to the next fire station in Glo@@ be , where they stayed until Friday .
Kr@@ aut@@ mann said that the floo@@ ding was &quot; spreading rapidly , &quot; as there were still heavy rainf@@ alls and that the authorities considered evacu@@ ation instructions .
according to Kr@@ aut@@ mann , an observer announced in the vicinity of Liv@@ ing@@ stone from midnight to Friday morning of 13.@@ 75 inches of rain .
Kr@@ aut@@ mann said that the rain has been considerably more balanced due to rainf@@ all since Wednesday .
the authorities stated that heavy ra@@ ins and floo@@ ding caused the rescu@@ ing of inhabitants from their homes in Tan@@ gi@@ p@@ ah@@ oa Par@@ ish and classroom expul@@ sion in five school districts .
the C@@ BS subsidiary WW@@ L reported that an or@@ derly in Tan@@ gi@@ p@@ ah@@ oa attacked 200 houses .
the inhabitants were evacu@@ ated in two churches , both flooded now .
the Chief Apostle of the commune of Rob@@ by Miller said that the authorities saved 72 people and seven pets that were washed by the floods .
in the towns of Am@@ ite and Ham@@ mond , emergency shel@@ ters were set up to house the evacu@@ ees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; once the water begins to go back , they will return to their homes again , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the town of Ham@@ mond , the municipality of Tan@@ gi@@ p@@ ah@@ oa , almost two dozen roads were closed due to the floo@@ ding water and sand@@ bags provided for the residents to take part , which hope to keep the water from their homes and shops .
&quot; the last great floo@@ ding we had was in March , &quot; said L@@ acy Land@@ rum of the city administration .
this seems to be a similar incident .
in Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , the emergency manager Ru@@ pert L@@ acy of Har@@ rison Coun@@ t@@ ys said that it was ra@@ ining on the Gulf Coast .
according to his data , a handful houses on Thursday were reported to be in@@ und@@ ated , but on Friday none of them were reported .
Keith T@@ own@@ son , manager at Shop@@ per Value F@@ oods in Am@@ ite , has been living in the area for 40 years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have seen water in places where I have never seen it before , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said T@@ own@@ son , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ma@@ ha@@ j Brown , 6 , &quot; pier@@ ced by bul@@ lets , &quot; survi@@ ves shooting in Philadelphia
the police report that the 6 @-@ year @-@ old boy was shot in Philadelphia this week already the second time that a 6 year old child is shot .
the grand@@ parents of the boy identified him for C@@ BS Philadelphia as Ma@@ ha@@ j Brown .
the grand@@ parents stated that Brown suffered several bul@@ let bre@@ aches , including in the loin , leg , arm and abdom@@ en , but that he was in hospital with his transport .
&quot; he has gone through a lot , his little body was ri@@ dd@@ led by bul@@ lets , &quot; his grandmother Del@@ ores Mel@@ chis@@ z shared with the transmitter .
I can &apos;t believe it .
the condition of the boy was classified as critical in a hospital and he had to undergo several operations .
the boy &apos;s family told the station that it is likely to recover again .
he should have started the first class in a local primary school .
brown was one of four people who were shot in German@@ town .
three men were also shot : two at the age of 29 and a 32 @-@ year @-@ old .
one of the 29 @-@ year @-@ old men is in critical condition ; the other two victims are in a stable state according to C@@ BS Philadelphia .
the boy was found on the front seat of a car together with the 29 @-@ year @-@ old , who is in a critical state , shot at , reports the transmitter .
the other two victims were not in the car and the police were investigating whether one of the injured men could be the perpetr@@ ators .
investig@@ ators told C@@ BS Philadelphia that apparently there had come to a cross@@ fire between several sho@@ ot@@ ers .
cartridge sleeves for assault ri@@ fl@@ es , which were traced back to various assault ri@@ fl@@ es , s@@ unk the scene of crime .
it seems that this is clearly a lasting struggle .
on the road , on both sides of the walk@@ way , there were sleeves .
so there seems to have been several armed fighters who were very active involved , &quot; said police det@@ achment Anthony Gin@@ al@@ di of the police in Philadelphia to the transmitter .
there were also several houses and vehicles in the area .
there was no arrest and the police re@@ port@@ edly reviewed the surveillance video .
on Tuesday , another 6 @-@ year @-@ old girl was met by a cri@@ cket on her arm , when she played in front of her house in the residential area of West O@@ ak Lan@@ e .
she re@@ covers herself and the police are still looking for a suspect .
why we need Sim@@ one , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie
that is what I imagine under the Women &apos;s olymp@@ i@@ onship in the gymn@@ as@@ tics and that for more than one reason .
first , I joined every summer Olympics since 1984 and the USA have never been so dominant .
and secondly : this team has three gymn@@ asts , Sim@@ one Bil@@ es , Gab@@ by Douglas and Lau@@ ren &quot; Lau@@ rie &quot; Her@@ nan@@ dez , who had inspired many young girls of other skin color .
the structure of this team , the A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man , the Jew@@ ess and Ma@@ dison Ko@@ cian , who is Catho@@ lics , makes everybody proud .
this team finally mirrors the USA .
it has soli@@ di@@ fied the black and h@@ is@@ panic female presence at the top of this sport .
in the last four years , the number one female female gymn@@ ast was an A@@ fr@@ o @-@ American woman .
last year Sim@@ one and Gab@@ by # 1 and # 2 were .
this shows strength .
at the last Olympic Games , Gab@@ by Douglas celebrated a surprising Olympic winner and America .
now the world was able to witness the incredible achievement of the triple world world champion Sim@@ one Bil@@ es , Douglas and Lau@@ rie Her@@ nan@@ dez , how they delivered unexpected but master@@ ful gy@@ ms .
on Thursday Sim@@ one became the fourth , h@@ eter@@ os@@ exual American woman who won Gold at an individual multi @-@ campaign event .
team member A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man won silver .
we experience the top of this type of sport , but gymn@@ asi@@ ums in the whole country do not look like this .
Sim@@ one , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie all beat the same way as A@@ ly and Ma@@ dison to get it into the Olympic team .
they are the &quot; Last Five , &quot; because the next Olympic team will only have four gymn@@ asts in the team . in addition , this is the last year with Mart@@ a Kar@@ oly@@ i as a trainer .
but the reality is that gymn@@ as@@ tics are an expensive sport , and Tur@@ ner is primarily involved in private gymn@@ as@@ tics , which are maintained by parents who pay for the training , training , travel , clothing , competition and hotel costs ( for the trainers and their gymn@@ asts and families ) .
the majority of these turn@@ tables lie in aff@@ lu@@ ent suburbs , which can support the business .
in these clubs , the gymn@@ asts receive their entire training and this is an expensive and long @-@ term engagement for the families .
A@@ im@@ ee Bo@@ or@@ man , trainer of Sim@@ one Bil@@ es , and Mag@@ gie Han@@ ey , trainer of Lau@@ rie Her@@ nan@@ dez , have trained both her athletes since they started the gymn@@ as@@ tics .
we have to give the municipalities au@@ n countless , young girls , who are inspired by Sim@@ one , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie , a more affordable and easy @-@ to @-@ reach exercise coach .
I founded my gymn@@ as@@ tics foundation for 20 years .
at my events we have offered free and affordable gymn@@ as@@ tics in Harlem for more than 15,000 urban young@@ sters ( especially black and h@@ is@@ panic ) and trained national and international winners .
in September we will expand to Detroit ( my hom@@ etown ) to offer the youth high @-@ quality gymn@@ as@@ tics , which deserve the opportunity to learn and benefit from this great Olympic sport .
gymn@@ as@@ tics develop strength , flexibility and coordination for the body as well as hard work , discipline and determination for the mind .
this combination offers lifel@@ ong benefits for health as well as for academic and professional success .
it is the inspiration of this team that can bring thousands of young girls to be interested in gymn@@ as@@ tics and that &apos;s great .
it is so important to participate in sports , especially for girls .
this is such an exciting time .
thanks Sim@@ one , A@@ ly , Lau@@ rie , Gab@@ by and Ma@@ dison for this real representation of &quot; Girl Power &quot; by holding the Olympic team golden and thank you , so many young girls with varying backgrounds motivated her to start her way to become healthy , strong and successful young women .
assistant physicians would like to organize other strikes after rej@@ ecting Jerem@@ y Hun@@ ts &apos;s proposal
the ministers had hoped to end the dispute over the changes by accepting a re@@ formed treaty with the officials of the British Medical Association , but 58 percent of the 37@@ ,000 resident physicians who voted in favor rejected him .
in July Hun@@ t announced plans to forci@@ bly introduce the treaty and said that the N@@ HS would be found in a &quot; Ni@@ em@@ and@@ s@@ land &quot; and that any further delay would be harmful to the employees and patients .
the first resident physicians should receive a new contract that includes changes to night and weekend supplements to improve care at times of times .
Dr Ellen Mc@@ Court , the chair@@ woman of the BM@@ A Committee for Assist@@ ants told last night in a message with : &quot; assistants have still serious concerns on the proposed contract , in particular that it will heat up the current staff crisis and it will be used to treat all doctors just . &quot;
with only eight weeks remaining until the first group of doctors fall under the new contract , progress must be made and time runs out .
efforts on the part of the BM@@ A to resolve disputes were met by the government on reluc@@ tance and sometimes on de@@ af@@ ening silence .
this was the result of a promise that Jerem@@ y Hun@@ t had made over the last month that his door would always be open .
Jerem@@ y Hun@@ t has to act now , raise the lift and address the cares of the resident doctors . &quot;
if he does not do this , the assistance physicians have made it clear that they are prepared to carry out further work combat measures .
the last strike at the end of April saw a surge of nearly 13@@ ,000 routine operations and 100,000 appointments , as nur@@ ses and veter@@ in@@ arians were included to provide medical doctors on the strike chain .
the ministers had hoped to end the dispute over the changes by accepting the re@@ formed contract with the officials of the British Medical Association .
the BM@@ A wants a better week pay for the 5@@ 4,000 assistance physicians who are subject to the contract .
Daniel Mor@@ timer , General Director of N@@ HS employees , called on the assistance physicians to stop the strike .
Mor@@ timer said : &quot; work combat measures do not achieve anything , but have already over@@ loaded teams and service providers and prepare patients , nur@@ ses and their families only concerns , need and break . &quot;
over the past two months , we have talked to the Committee of Assist@@ ants and responded positively to the health ministry as well as other mini@@ stries on concerns regarding guar@@ di@@ an@@ ship and whi@@ st@@ leb@@ lower .
the employers hoped that continued positive engagement on other important topics - such as posting , flexibility in training , training courses , mutual recognition of the curriculum , training holidays and gender pay gap in medicine - were a sign of how serious it was the employers , the Health Education England and the Ministry of Health regarding compliance with the agreements with the BM@@ A in November , February and May .
the £ 2 @-@ per day drug that can reduce heart attack risk
thousands of heart attacks patients will benefit from a £ 2 @-@ per day medication after recommended by the authorities to admini@@ ster this more people for a longer period of time .
the anti @-@ inflammatory drug T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or reduces the risk of repeated heart attacks for people with heart disease .
the medication is administered after a heart attack for 12 months , reducing the risk of stroke or other heart attack .
the N@@ ICE regulatory authority has recommended a four @-@ year @-@ long intake to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems .
the N@@ ICE regulatory authority has recommended a four @-@ year @-@ long intake to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems .
around 140@@ ,000 people suffer from a heart attack every year and a quarter of them suffer another heart attack or stroke .
heart attacks and strokes are caused by accum@@ ulations of fatty tissue in the ar@@ tery walls that form coverings .
when the floor@@ covering breaks apart , it can cause a blood cl@@ ots that c@@ logged the blood flow to the heart , causing a heart attack .
when the blood c@@ lot dis@@ solves , it can flow through the blood stream and clo@@ g the blood flow to the brain , causing a stroke .
individuals who have already had a heart attack are subject to a higher risk of having another heart attack .
T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or , produced by the British company A@@ stra@@ Zen@@ eca and marketed under the trade name Bri@@ x@@ en@@ eca , reduces this risk by making the formation of blood cl@@ ots more impro@@ b@@ able .
the introduction of N@@ ICE , published today , recommends a 12 month intake of 90@@ mg T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or , followed by 60@@ mg with a twice daily intake of aspir@@ in for the next three years .
Professor Car@@ ole Long@@ son , Director of the N@@ ICE Health Technology Assessment Center said : &quot; despite the availability of secondary prevention , a quarter of all persons having a heart attack have another heart attack or stroke - often with disa@@ strous consequences . &quot;
the fear of a renewed heart attack can have significant negative effects on the quality of life of a person .
experience shows that T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or in combination with aspir@@ in is effective in reducing further heart attacks and strokes in people who have already had a heart attack .
with a preliminary recommendation from T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or , we are pleased that we are able to extend available treatment options to thousands of people who can benefit from it .
the information on the efficacy and safety of T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or - especially the risk of bleeding - is limited to a period of up to three years .
culture of Political Cor@@ rect@@ ness makes electoral fraud flour@@ ish in Muslim areas
the former mayor of Tower Ham@@ lets Lut@@ fur Rah@@ man was removed last year due to corruption from office
a culture of political rect@@ ness has led to the fact that widespread electoral fraud in Muslim communities is unknow@@ ingly ignored as a devastating government report today revealed .
the former cabinet member Sir Eric Pick@@ les verb@@ ally attacks the police , election ob@@ servers and city halls for ignor@@ ing evidence of mis@@ use due to &quot; hyper@@ sensitivity to eth@@ ni@@ city and religion . &quot;
the former Minister of Integration and the Local Government , who is now a rebel , said that the in@@ timi@@ dation of voters from religious motives would be so bad that the police should be allowed to set off barriers outside poll@@ s to protect in@@ timi@@ dated voters .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he recommends that voters should carry out a reference to prove their identity in elections . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at present , a vot@@ er only has to name his name and address .
the report proposes to apply non removable ink to a person &apos;s finger when they vote for their vote in order to prevent someone from choosing twice .
whi@@ st@@ leb@@ lower should get more protection , says Sir Eric .
he calls for the press to have more access to congreg@@ ational documents and decisions of un@@ official committees or working groups .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this serves not only against election fraud , but also to protect the local government from the broader corruption and financial fraud culture that comes with it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the report was ordered by Down@@ ing Street as a result of the Tower Ham@@ lets election sc@@ andal in the east of London .
last year , a special district court ruled that the inc@@ umbent mayor Lut@@ on Rah@@ man should be reli@@ eved after a lit@@ any of corrupt and illegal practice of his ministry .
the Court found that Rah@@ man had per@@ ver@@ ted the religious feelings of his Muslim community in a cy@@ ni@@ cal manner and that he would have sil@@ enced his critics with rac@@ ism and Islam@@ opho@@ bia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Rah@@ man is said to have led &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; his campaign on the basis that it is the religious duty of Muslims to choose him . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
up to 300 voices were either doub@@ t@@ ful or the consequence of im@@ itation in which one person sel@@ ects someone else .
Sir Eric said that there was evidence of fraud all over the country .
he expressed in particular alar@@ ming on the frau@@ dul@@ ent letter choice - in which older members of the Muslim community had pressure on people to choose a candidate of their choice .
Sir Eric , pic@@ tured , made several recommendations to clean up the electoral system , including guiding le@@ as@@ ings to prove the identity
in his report it says : &quot; as proof was appropriate that pressure on vulnerable members of some ethnic minorities was carried out , especially women and young people , in order to choose according to the will of the elderly , in particular communities with Pakistan or Banglad@@ es@@ ian background .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there were concerns that ... state institutions have unknow@@ ingly ignored such behavior because of &quot; politically correct &quot; hyper@@ sensitivity to eth@@ ni@@ city and religion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Sir Eric spoke 50 recommendations to clean up the system , including the prohibition that political activists deal with let@@ ter@@ al documents in order to stop &quot; re@@ election . &quot;
the report , which is considered by Ther@@ esa May , also requires tough@@ er registration reviews to prevent the electoral register being used for immigration and social bet@@ ting purposes .
consider options to ask voters prior to choosing your ID .
do not use removable ink on a person &apos;s finger as soon as she has released her voice to prevent someone choosing twice .
conduct systematic reviews on the nationality of a person to ensure they are eligible for election .
a three @-@ year limitation on applications for automatic letter selection .
ban that political activists deal with complete letter sel@@ ections and envel@@ opes of letter sel@@ ections .
the police have the authority to set up shut @-@ off stations for voting stations .
a change in the law that facilit@@ ated an accus@@ ation of in@@ timi@@ dation in accordance with the People &apos;s Act 1983 .
photograph@@ ing prohibited in voting stations .
requirement that only English may be used in the voting stations ( except Wales ) .
intensi@@ fy the training to ensure that the employees are generally accepted that voters go to the El@@ ection Cab@@ in alone .
Sir Eric falls over the Metropolitan Police and finds it &quot; amazing &quot; that after the Tower Ham@@ lets there was no criminal complaint .
&quot; the electoral court has declared Lut@@ man Rah@@ man and his substitute for a lit@@ any of corrupt and illegal practices un@@ suitable , &quot; he said .
he was found guilty of a number of reasons - according to the high requirements in the criminal proceedings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he also critic@@ ises the in@@ effective &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ab@@ ha@@ k@@ Controls &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of the election registers of the city halls . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sir Eric said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Court judgment in Tower Ham@@ lets last year was a warning signal . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
our country is a proud heritage as the mother of parliam@@ ents , but the wor@@ rying and cover@@ t spread of electoral fraud and den@@ ial of some authorities thre@@ aten this good reputation .
crazy about K@@ ate Rad@@ ler @-@ Doppel@@ gän@@ ger and other famous Doppel@@ gän@@ ger of Olympic athletes in Rio
fans of the 2016 Olympics in Rio will be amazed at the French cycling cell@@ ist Pau@@ line Ferr@@ and @-@ PRE@@ VO@@ T , who has proved to be an impressive double @-@ member of the Du@@ chess of Cambridge .
but the 24 @-@ year @-@ old Olympi@@ ad is by far not the only ath@@ lete who has his own famous Doppel@@ gän@@ ger - at least not if one is allowed to believe the social media .
in honour of the Olympic Games in Rio and all the famous faces that fli@@ cker at the time on our screens , F@@ email has created a list of Olympic Games that have more than just a certain simil@@ arity to Hollywood &apos;s celeb@@ ri@@ ties .
the h@@ unter and wolf : team member of the US team in arch@@ ery Bra@@ dy Ell@@ ison , left , is compared with Leonardo Di@@ Cap@@ rio since his childhood
besides K@@ ate &apos;s Doppel@@ gän@@ ger on the rac@@ et@@ rack , many people on the internet pointed out how a certain ar@@ cher could be the twin from A @-@ Pro@@ mi Leonardo Di@@ Cap@@ rio .
the team member of the US team in Arch@@ ery Bra@@ dy Ell@@ ison caused a rush on Twitter after pictures on which he looks similar to the Wolf of Wall Street Star .
in fact , the ar@@ cher got the ma@@ dness in the social media and admitted that he has already heard since his childhood that he looks like Leo .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I do not see any great simil@@ arity except for facial hair , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; told Bra@@ dy the Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; he is a good @-@ looking guy , so I guess that as a compli@@ ment . &quot;
one of the most popular compar@@ isons since London 2012 will undoubtedly be the focus of this year : the striking simil@@ arity between the British Wei@@ t@@ spr@@ inger Gre@@ g Ru@@ ther@@ ford and the popular actor N@@ eil Patrick Har@@ ris .
Russian gymn@@ ast Ali@@ ya Must@@ afa , with her big expressive eyes , is supposed to go through the Cuban @-@ American singer Gl@@ oria Est@@ ef@@ an .
and in the swimming pool , the South African s@@ wimm@@ ers Cameron van der Bur@@ gh has been compared with the G@@ le@@ e Star Matthew Mor@@ rison for years .
one course higher : this user believes Nathan is the &quot; athle@@ tic version &quot; of the In@@ c@@ eption actor
another ongoing comparison was drawn between the tennis star Raf@@ ael Nad@@ al and actor Jos@@ h Hart@@ nett , who has similarly severe ey@@ eb@@ rows and lips .
the Russian silver medal s@@ wimm@@ ers Yu@@ lia E@@ fi@@ mo@@ va has more than just the sun@@ tann@@ ed skin and bl@@ ond hair like the act@@ ress Ann@@ aly@@ n@@ ne Mc@@ C@@ ord , while American Nathan was att@@ ested by fans to resem@@ ble an &quot; athle@@ tic version of Joseph Gordon Lev@@ itt . &quot;
strong women : soccer star Hope Solo , left , and D@@ ex@@ ter act@@ ress J@@ enni@@ fer Car@@ p@@ enter , right , have a similar facial form and eyes
not the only one : a Twitter user was very happy that others liked the simil@@ arities
theory into space : according to this user , there may be a reason for the simil@@ arity of the couple .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a Twitter user explained their satisfaction that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the rest of the Internet thinks that Hope Solo and J@@ enni@@ fer Car@@ p@@ enter are almost identical . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in fact , the US football star Hope Solo and the D@@ ex@@ ter act@@ ress J@@ enni@@ fer Car@@ p@@ enter have an incredibly similar face @-@ shape and eyes .
other popular compar@@ isons included Ker@@ ri Wal@@ sh @-@ J@@ enn@@ ings and her smile , which is almost identical to that of act@@ ress Laura Lin@@ ney as well as the gold medal winner in Tur@@ nen Gab@@ by Douglas , which has her own beautiful , wide smile , similar to that of Br@@ ing It On Star Gabri@@ elle Union .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; C@@ BC comment@@ ator for the Olympic Games ap@@ olog@@ ises for his statement that Chinese float &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; like a pig died &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
By@@ ron Mac@@ Don@@ al@@ ds analysis of the fourth place of 14 @-@ year @-@ old Ai Yan@@ ane at d@@ r 4x@@ 200m
the Canadian broad@@ caster C@@ BC had to ap@@ olog@@ ise after one of his comment@@ ators said that the 14 @-@ year @-@ old Chinese swi@@ mmer died &quot; like M@@ ief , &quot; and during the race as &quot; a pig died . &quot;
the comment@@ ator By@@ ron Mac@@ Don@@ al@@ ds thought that his microphone was switched off when at the end of the 4x@@ 100m fre@@ estyle swi@@ mmer relay his own opinions .
Mac@@ Donald who was brought on board in the commentary team of the C@@ BS to give more &quot; colour &quot; could be heard : &quot; this little 14 year old Chinese girl has lost the union , baby . &quot;
too excited , as he called M@@ ief , he died like a pig .

viewers across Canada responded quickly after they were shocked by sound and language
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Emm@@ ett Mac@@ far@@ lane twe@@ ete , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; H@@ as the C@@ BC comment@@ ator just said that the 14 @-@ year @-@ old swi@@ mmer from China &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; like a pig died &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ? ? ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the idi@@ ot did not realize that they were still on show . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ai Yan@@ is from China has been described as follows : &quot; this small 14 @-@ year @-@ old chin@@ ese girl has lost the union , baby . &quot;
the criticism against By@@ ron Mac@@ Donald on Twitter came fast and hard , with which many spoke to him .
Twitter users didn &apos;t stop when they heard how in@@ sensitive By@@ ron Mac@@ Donald was
another Twitter user in Sarah Par@@ adi@@ s wrote : &quot; wow , # By@@ ron Mac@@ Donald .
you represent the C@@ BC and Canada and let us look like ra@@ cists . # made .
shortly after , Scott Russ@@ el , who moder@@ ated the C@@ BC broadcast , ap@@ ologi@@ zed live for Mac@@ Donald &apos;s comment and said : &quot; we ap@@ ologi@@ ze that the commentary was broadcast on a floating performance . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was an un@@ fortunate wording , we are sorry that it happened . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
C@@ BC ap@@ ologi@@ zed at the end for more than 90 times with the people responding to the news about Twitter
the schol@@ arly colleague Scott Russ@@ el had to ap@@ ologi@@ ze in the name of Mac@@ Donald
C@@ BC copied and added his ap@@ ology to more than 90 other Twitter users compl@@ aining about Mac@@ Donald &apos;s comments
the network also ap@@ olog@@ ised quickly and issued a message .
we sincer@@ ely regret that these statements were made and that it was made possible for them to be broadcast .
yesterday night we ap@@ ologi@@ zed to our audience on the show and our followers in the social media .
to make one clear , By@@ ron &apos;s comments related to the performance of the swi@@ mmer and not on them as a person .
nevertheless , they were in@@ appropriate and an un@@ happy wording . By@@ ron does what he said , very sorry .
on Thursday afternoon Mac@@ Donald was ap@@ ologi@@ zed in the broadcast and tried to justify his re@@ mark by saying that it was not his intention that it was interpreted as a personal attack .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I would like to take a moment to ap@@ ologi@@ ze for the comment I made after the Women &apos;s Squ@@ ad@@ ron in the C@@ BC Olympic turn . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have focused on the performance of the swi@@ mmer and not on it as a person . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course , no cont@@ emp@@ t was intended and I &apos;m very sorry . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
shop@@ pers in Pri@@ mark ou@@ tra@@ ged about women who sham@@ elessly tried under@@ wear in the heart of the business
the buyers did not know where to look , when a woman went out to dress her clothes in the middle of a mark to try under@@ pants .
to wor@@ sen the situation , she looked at her as she looked at it , pulled her off and put her back into the shelf .
she continued to browse and tried four pairs of under@@ pants in a shop at the Bou@@ ver@@ ie Place Shopping Centre in Folk@@ estone .
the Pri@@ mark shop at the Bou@@ ver@@ ie Place Shopping Centre in Folk@@ estone , where the woman ta@@ sted the pants before she put her back to the shelf
a mother of two children , J@@ enny Davi@@ dson , who was in the store at the same time , said that after the mysterious woman had ta@@ sted the under@@ wear , she re@@ treated and left the business without buying anything . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The people couldn &apos;t believe what they saw . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
standing in the middle of the sales area she took a pair of under@@ pants from the delivery , pulled out their own ti@@ ghts and pants and ta@@ sted them .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she didn &apos;t even try to find a somewhat dis@@ crete place to do it - she was just there , che@@ ek@@ y like O@@ sk@@ ar . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; everyone star@@ ed when they pulled out the under@@ pants that you obviously didn &apos;t like , because they put them back on the shelf . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
she repeated the same with three other under@@ pants before she finally decided that she didn &apos;t like anything , got up and went out .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it did not seem to distur@@ b anyone - or to think about the person who , under certain circumstances , buy the under@@ pants that they had ta@@ sted . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mrs. Davi@@ dson , 33 , who lives in K@@ ent , said : &quot; how re@@ fut@@ able that someone would take under@@ pants with him who had another person and who were not washed . &quot;
the incident occurred on Tuesday afternoon .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ms. Davi@@ dson added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as I have received , the staff tries to pull out the clothes after they went - which is just as good . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I would hate to go home with a new pair of under@@ pants and find out that another woman had her and withdrawn and she was not washed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a spokes@@ man of Pri@@ mark said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pri@@ mark is aware of the incident that took place on Tuesday August 9 at our branch in Folk@@ stone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

how to protect yourself from weapons attacks with Kra@@ v Mag@@ a
the world outside is a dangerous place , but this video of Dail@@ y@@ mail@@ .com could make it a little safer for you .
we talked to Rh@@ on Miz@@ ra@@ chi , a Grand Master of the Kra@@ v Mag@@ a Association in New York to find out how to deal with armed rob@@ bers at a close distance .
regardless of whether you approach you from the front or from the back , this video will show you how to turn the spe@@ ar around for your rob@@ ber .
if you approach you from behind , then you should turn around as first , so that you can see your aggres@@ sor and go out of the line , &quot; says Miz@@ ra@@ chi .
then take the weapon between your for@@ ear@@ m and your shoulder before hitting it with your free el@@ bows .
beat him with his knee in the bar and twist while the Att@@ acker cur@@ bs from pain , the weapon from his hands . beat him with the run into the face and move backwards while they direct the weapon on it .
for attack@@ ers who approach from the front , the technique is similar - move your body out of the line , grab the gun and twist it so that the attack@@ er can &apos;t shoot .
shift the weight to the weapon at the same time and beat the Att@@ acker to the chest , then turn the weapon out of its grip before moving backwards and strai@@ gh@@ ten the weapon on it .
sounds difficult ?
watch the video to see exactly what it makes in Miz@@ ra@@ chi .
but remember that it is the saf@@ est to hand over your money , unless you are a Kra@@ v Mag@@ a Grand@@ master .
traveler Ian W@@ right sch@@ ab@@ t for a travel guide his tongue at the dir@@ ti@@ est places in Europe
a British trav@@ eller under@@ lined his immune system and perf@@ ector of a serious trial by det@@ ecting some of the dir@@ ti@@ est and disgu@@ sting places in Europe .
the moder@@ ator and travel author Ian W@@ right , 51 , from Su@@ ff@@ ol@@ k ab@@ dic@@ ated his course on a euro note , a ban@@ ister at Pic@@ ca@@ dil@@ ly Cir@@ cus , a flush button of a draw toilet and a public phone in Russia to prove the resili@@ ence of his immune system .
before checking every object , he used a lumin@@ ometer to show himself and to show us what he will get involved .
but the experiment , filmed under the title &quot; The Li@@ ck@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to In@@ ner Str@@ ength , &quot; brought some surprising results to daylight .
the idea to check the flush button of a draw toilet , which has already been used by thousands of others , may be completely re@@ pul@@ sive , but in fact there are more bad bacteria in a kitchen sink .
on his journey through Europe , Mr. W@@ right spoke to doctors and medical professionals about the promotion of gut bacteria as well as about his own health .
fortunately left nothing that he had ta@@ sted , more than a bad after@@ taste in the mouth .
Mr. W@@ right was known to test the resistance of his intest@@ ine by traveling through the world and ate odd as well as wonderful things .
from public ban@@ ist@@ ers to stations to flush toilets of toilets , the task assigned its immune system definitely among a sample
in the film he told me : &quot; as a child I was relatively un@@ concerned about my health and I put all sorts of things in my mouth , earth , worms and mud water . &quot;
in the film , he did justice to his reputation .
the only thing he refused was a dirty public toilet in Russia .
his test finish showed a lumin@@ ometer rating of more than 4000 units .
compared to this , the lumin@@ ometric number of freshly washed hands is less than 60 .
but there was a Russian toilet he refused to de@@ em after its lumin@@ ometer rating was over 4000 units while freshly washed hands have less than 60 units .
Mr. W@@ right and Finnish manufacturer of dairy products Vali@@ o produced the travel film &quot; The Li@@ ck@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to In@@ ner Str@@ ength , &quot; which shows the number of bacteria in different places like the bathroom
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the film , he says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this comes close to the worst that I had sm@@ elled in a toilet . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is nothing worse than that !
I will not check out here because it is disgu@@ sting here .
&quot; the Li@@ ck@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to In@@ ner Str@@ ength &quot; was produced in collaboration with the Finnish manufacturer of dairy products Vali@@ o .
the company equi@@ ps Mr. W@@ right with Vali@@ o Gef@@ il@@ us , which contains lac@@ tic acid bacteria as well as vitamin C and D to support the promotion of intestinal bacteria and immune system .
Vali@@ os Senior Vice President for snacks , juices and new categories Ni@@ ko Vu@@ or@@ en@@ ma@@ a says : &quot; we really wanted to offer consumers something new .
something that is fascinating to look at and at the same time explains the advantages of pro@@ biotics .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we conducted crazy bra@@ inst@@ or@@ ming that ended that we said &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Let us call us Ian . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they claim that the interest in intestinal health is becoming a global phenomenon
instead of talking about products , we wanted to put them in a greater context - the good and bad bacteria in our everyday environment , the importance of gut health and how it is linked to the immune system .
growing interest in gut health is a global phenomenon and with the documentary we were able to provide consumers with more information in an interesting way .
I also think the film shows that we have a great sense of humor !
Tom Hak@@ ala , who directed the film , added : &quot; let me tell you - I would have lost my respect for Ian if he had ta@@ sted some of the things I had ordered him to lick , like the disgu@@ sting Russian toilet that is shown in the film . &quot;
of course there were things in which it was easier to get Ian to check them and others where it was pretty difficult .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m glad that we recorded some of these dirty goo@@ dies on film . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in a survey conducted by Vali@@ o in 2015 , 84 percent of all respon@@ dents reported lac@@ tic acid bacteria , especially with the well @-@ being of stomach and intest@@ ines and 58 percent said that they have at least occasionally used products containing lac@@ tic acid bacteria .
A@@ social family destroyed before Del@@ o@@ gi@@ ung social housing in S@@ alt@@ ash , Corn@@ wall
an as@@ o@@ cial family left her social apartment after a del@@ o@@ gi@@ ation with a loss of £ 50,000 because she had terr@@ orized her neighbors .
T@@ anya Skel@@ don and her partner Sh@@ au@@ n Tre@@ bil@@ bie were thrown after a long list of complaints from her estate in S@@ alt@@ ash , Corn@@ wall .
after being forci@@ bly removed from their property , shocked employees of the housing cooperative found the property in an ir@@ repar@@ able state .
the walls had g@@ aping holes , wooden plan@@ ks were torn up , rub@@ b@@ ish was scattered on the floor and gra@@ ff@@ iti was s@@ me@@ ared on the walls .
the family has been res@@ ett@@ led and it is believed that it now lives in a private accommodation
Don@@ na Mc@@ E@@ vo@@ y , who works for the property management at Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing , said that she was afraid that the apartment was no longer repaired .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; It was an absolute night@@ mare for the people and I think people don &apos;t have to live in this way . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are many things to consider since this property is probably considered to be not as beautiful part of Corn@@ wall .
the family is not@@ orious and their reputation is also .
the couple had three sons who lived in the apartment in the meantime and the police said that the terror that the family had added , street fights with bas@@ eb@@ all sl@@ ur@@ ry , in@@ timi@@ dation by residents , drug abuse , drug traffi@@ cking and excessive scre@@ aming , quar@@ rels and floods .
Skel@@ don , 47 , whose name was on the lease , got an arrangement for anti @-@ social behaviour in June .
in some rooms of the house , which may be torn down under certain circumstances , old garbage was found
in the estate , where drugs were tra@@ ded in the past , the wooden legs were ri@@ pped open
neighbors said they had to fight them on the street and regularly called the police .
Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing gave her and her partner this week viol@@ ently by the property after giving them an extended period of 11 weeks to volunteer .
the del@@ o@@ gi@@ ation was che@@ ered by neighbours that said their lives were made hell .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; They didn &apos;t care about anyone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we lived 20 years beside them and it was always bad .
the countless times we tell the police here are incredible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we couldn &apos;t sleep this morning . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we stood up because it was so quiet here - we are not used to it !
now , where they are finally gone , it will be nice .
Adam F@@ itz@@ patri@@ ck , N@@ eigh@@ bour@@ hood Enfor@@ cement Manager of Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing , said it would have ab@@ used family with local authorities .
the family lived in the house where the police were called at regular intervals for 20 years .
on the over@@ grown side of the Municipal House , garbage and old toys were thrown down
he added , &quot; It is a shame that the ten@@ ant would have agreed to accept any responsibility for their behaviour and family , as a dele@@ tion is always the final step that Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing takes into account .
this was a very difficult case , because the behavior was extreme and their actions for their neighbours had to be horrible .
I appreciate all the work that my team , the police of De@@ von and Corn@@ wall , as well as members of the community who have cour@@ age@@ ously approached us and have given us the information .
I hope that this development will give comfort to some neighbors and that the message con@@ veys that anti @-@ social behaviour is not tolerated .
F@@ itz@@ patri@@ ck said that all three sons had lived in the house at different times , but that they were all over 20 .
a dirty mattress that is left in one of the bedrooms of the house after the dele@@ tion on the ground .
house@@ keeping workers will now have to leave rub@@ b@@ ish mountains that surround the house
in 2014 , the police conducted a raid in the house and found over 70@@ g of cannabis as well as balances , par@@ ap@@ her@@ alia and cash in the amount of £ 1,@@ 700 .
Skel@@ don received a fine after having found himself guilty of own@@ ing a class B drug in commercial intent .
she claimed that the money was for a tom@@ bst@@ one of her son Lee Skel@@ don , who died in 2013 in a car accident .
after they were without shelter , it is assumed that T@@ anya and their partner are now living in a private accommodation in Pl@@ ym@@ outh .
many of the walls of the house were gra@@ ff@@ iti .
the police say that they will navigate ten@@ ants who do not stick to the house rules
Angela C@@ row by the police of De@@ von and Corn@@ wall informed that the expul@@ sion was a clear warning to the other ten@@ ants who do not abide by the house rules .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this goes to those who think they can behave without self @-@ reproach and those who were har@@ med by such a behaviour , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the De@@ von and Corn@@ wall police will never tolerate any criminal and anti @-@ social behaviour that will continue to work with partners to protect our communities .
tourists in Portugal stag@@ ger@@ ed after an open military jet beach over@@ flew
sun worshi@@ ppers in Av@@ eiro , Portugal survived the shock of their lives
a Portuguese P @-@ 3@@ C Ori@@ on plane of the Air Force dropped an incredible crash
the air forces stated that it was on a training flight , but insi@@ sted that no safety risk was occurring .
this was the moment in which frigh@@ tened tourists begin to panic after an eff@@ i@@ ent jet become crashing over a full beach .
dramatic video footage showed how the military plane flow@@ ed almost in pal@@ p@@ able proximity to the sun worshi@@ ppers on the beach section in Av@@ eiro in the north of Portugal .
the vac@@ ation@@ ers sprang up as they understand@@ ably began to worry about the noise of the nozzle trou@@ ghs , without first seeing what came through the clouds on them .
the incident occurred yesterday afternoon in Costa Nova , near Av@@ eiro .
Daniel Fern@@ andes , one of the many holi@@ day@@ makers who posted videos about the dramatic F@@ ly @-@ By in the social media , said : &quot; it flew very deep twice and there was a moment when it looked like it would crash . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; N@@ un@@ o Ar@@ ro@@ ja added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was just surfing and it felt as if the plane crashed on me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
tourists at the beach of Av@@ eiro were in panic when the plane came out of the darkness and incredibly deep @-@ flo@@ cked
the Portuguese air@@ strikes today announced that the pilot of the P @-@ 3@@ C Ori@@ on plane was on a training flight to identify fishing boats in front of the coast and had to fly so deeply that this was the only way to see them .
the spokes@@ man said that the jet was flying a bit deeper than usual because of the bad visibility due to bad visibility , but the Air Force insi@@ sted that security at no time was at risk .
land fires destroyed parts of the Portuguese mainland during this summer , with four people coming to death on the island of Madeira .
the Portuguese air forces today announced that the pilot had to fly so deeply because of the conditions - heavy fog and smoke , which restric@@ ts his view .
the plane was on a training flight , where the pilot had to identify fishing boats as part of the exercise .
Super@@ cup : Bar@@ ca with worries about Sev@@ ille
Sevilla - FC Barcelona is the first step to win the first title in the new Football season on Sunday .
the Catal@@ ans compete in the du@@ el around the Spanish Super Cup against the FC Sevilla , the return game is rising three days later at Camp No@@ u .
the Dou@@ ble@@ winning won &apos;t have to go to N@@ ey@@ mar in the power dinner with the under@@ rated Cup@@ fin@@ alist and reig@@ ning European League champion , who cont@@ ests the Olympic football tournament with Brazil .
in addition , there is also a lack of Marc @-@ Andr@@ e ter St@@ egen .
the German suffered a change of b@@ anding in the knee with which the demand for bar@@ ca was clari@@ fied at least for the time being in favor of Claudio Bra@@ vo .
the Chil@@ ean International and T@@ er St@@ egen have been competing for the status as number one for two years .
coach Luis En@@ rique reno@@ unc@@ ed a clear decision in this regard and left Bra@@ vo in the League , but T@@ er St@@ egen in the majority of the other competitions took the lead .
before the first mandatory game of the new season there is doubt about the fitness state of the team , which was humili@@ ated on Saturday in a test game from Liverpool to 0 : 4 .
also at 3 : 2 at the rehear@@ sal weekend against S@@ amp@@ d@@ oria on Wednesday Li@@ onel Mess@@ i and Co. did not really convince .
Sev@@ ille , in turn , has the 2 : 3 defeat following the extension of the European Super@@ cup against Real Madrid and asp@@ ires the second triumph at &quot; Super@@ cop@@ a de Esp@@ ana . &quot;
Barcelona , with eleven successes , is the record winner in this race .
Ma Long in a separate league for ping @-@ p@@ ong gold
Rio de Janeiro - The Chinese Ma Long is the new table tennis tournament winner .
the 27 @-@ year @-@ old defeated his comp@@ atri@@ ot and &quot; defending champion &quot; Z@@ hang Ji@@ ke 4 : 0 on Thursday in Rio de Janeiro in a one @-@ sided finale .
in this way , the world rank first won the &quot; Golden Grand S@@ lam &quot; with success at the World Cup , World Cup , World @-@ Tour Fin@@ al@@ tur@@ nier and even Olympia .
bronze went to the Japanese Ju@@ n Mi@@ zut@@ ani .
the two Chinese made it to the final game as expected and made the title among themselves .
it was clear that for the third time in a row , a Chinese would fetch the single title in the sign of the Five R@@ ings .
last non @-@ Chinese on the top Olympic podium was the former SV@@ S @-@ N@@ Ö Legi@@ on@@ ary Ry@@ u Se@@ ung @-@ min from South Korea .
Ma and Z@@ hang were left alone on the plate , between the sentences and in time @-@ outs , they had no coaches with them .
they had withdrawn on the tri@@ b@@ une and left their cont@@ ests alone in fair competition .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;ve played the matches until now for my country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; in the finale , I play for myself , &quot; Z@@ hang had said .
after the game , gold and silver med@@ alists posed with the China @-@ Flag .
the match itself was un@@ expect@@ edly un@@ il@@ ateral .
Ma had really strug@@ gled with his 28 @-@ year @-@ old opponent only in the first movement .
after that he set the tempo on the plate and dropped Z@@ hang from there only a total of 13 points .
the su@@ prem@@ acy of Ma did not develop the expected fli@@ pping match .
but nevertheless , there were enough breathtaking ball@@ ads to be seen .
Mi@@ ha@@ ani won the game for bronze against the 40 @-@ year @-@ old Vladimir Sam@@ son@@ ow 4 : 1 .
in his quarter @-@ final against the German champion Dimit@@ ri@@ j Ov@@ t@@ char@@ ov , the Bel@@ ar@@ usi@@ an injured a rib@@ bed of rib@@ bed , was afterwards in medical treatment , had to &quot; ultimately &quot; settle with sheet metal .
the Swe@@ des Jan @-@ O@@ ve Wald@@ ner ( 38 / 2004 ) and Jör@@ gen Per@@ sson ( 42 / 2008 ) were by the way in similarly high table tennis age Olympic @-@ Fourth .
Donald Tr@@ ump acknow@@ le@@ dges &quot; tremendous problems &quot; in the election campaign
the leadership of the US Rep@@ ublic@@ ans is pl@@ agu@@ ed by massive concerns , even in traditional conservative states to lose their majority .
presidential candidate Donald Tr@@ ump has now given weaknesses of his election campaign in the present Republi@@ can strongh@@ old U@@ tah .
a rare moment in which the multi@@ lingual and self @-@ assured multi @-@ billi@@ on@@ aire expressed something like concerns , as correspon@@ dents reported .
after he threw 16 ri@@ vals out of the race in his own Republi@@ can camp , doubts about his success in the fight for the White House are now growing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have huge problems in U@@ tah , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Tr@@ ump to evangel@@ ical Christians who asked for support in major states such as Ohio , Florida or Virginia . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
due to false reports about his can@@ did@@ acy , he resum@@ ed his famous media campaign .
republi@@ can strongh@@ olds sha@@ ven
U@@ tah is usually a secure bank for the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans .
according to a survey conducted by the surv@@ ey@@ ors out of June , Tr@@ ump and his competi@@ tor were equally charged by the Democrats , H@@ illary Clinton .
other institutions see Tr@@ ump in the forward , but not by the distance that is common for Republi@@ can candidates in the federal state .
Arizona and Georgia are regarded as endangered .
in an interview with the CN@@ BC station , Tr@@ ump answered the question of how he wanted to stop the advance of Clinton : &quot; just as I have done so far . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this will be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; either successful or I will make a very nice , long holiday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he makes no difference than telling the truth . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if it is not enough for him at the end for reasons of political correctness , that &apos;s ok , Tr@@ ump said further .
then I return to a very good way of life .
according to press reports , the party should have threatened the Tr@@ ump party to withdraw funds to support its electoral campaign , it should not be able to present better survey values .
instead , the candidate of the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans for Congress would be more strongly under arms .
Olympics : tri@@ ster fraud in dop@@ ing test
the IO@@ C wants to set up a disciplinary committee on the case .
Kenya &apos;s athletes are facing the second dop@@ ing affair at the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro .
after a fraud control in the Olympic Village , Kenya sent a trainer back home .
the International Olympic Committee decided to promptly set up a disciplinary committee in order to investigate the case .
a Ken@@ yan function@@ ary reported that the former S@@ printer and present coach , John An@@ z@@ rah , gave a urine sample in the Olympic village under the name of the 800 @-@ metre @-@ runner F@@ erg@@ us@@ on Rot@@ ich .
this was reported to the team leadership of Kenya by the dop@@ ing inspec@@ tors .
the IA@@ AF World Association has asked the IO@@ C for information about the case in order to ex@@ ert its own investigations , an IA@@ AF spokesperson stated .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; depending on the results of the investigation and the subsequent measures of the IO@@ C , the IA@@ AF will evaluate an assessment , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said it in an IA@@ AF account . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; he ( An@@ z@@ rah ) has gone to the D@@ oping control station and has spent himself as F@@ erg@@ us@@ on Red , handed out and signed the test , &quot; said Kenya &apos;s Head of Mission Stephan Ara@@ p So@@ i .
he was in possession of the accreditation of the athletes standing on the list for training controls of the World Anti @-@ D@@ oping agency .
F@@ erg@@ us@@ on Red had become more than 800 meters in Beijing in 2015 .
four days earlier , the Turkish Ath@@ le@@ tics He@@ ads of He@@ ads , Michael Rot@@ ich , had been dra@@ fted by the Rio Games .
he is said to have informed athletes of his country about upcoming dop@@ ing tests .
according to media reports , he was reported to have been arrested at his return to Nairobi &apos;s airport .
Kenya is already under special observation at the IO@@ C after numerous dop@@ ing off@@ ences .
in the announcement of the more than 2000 D@@ oping target controls submitted by the IO@@ C before the Rio Games , it was stran@@ gely noted that especially athletes from Kenya and Russia were targeted .
before the summer Olympics in Brazil , the World Anti @-@ D@@ oping agency had exer@@ ted a lot of pressure on the African country to create an anti @-@ dop@@ ing law and a functioning control system .
the law was adopted a few weeks before the commen@@ cement of the Olympics .
as a result , WA@@ DA Kenya accepted from the list of countries whose dop@@ ing control is compliant with the rules of WA@@ DA .
Kenya is considered a great runner @-@ nation .
the athletes of the country won most med@@ als at the World Cup 2015 in Beijing .
in a series of TV reports of the ARD , alleg@@ ations were repeatedly raised that dop@@ ing agents are easily accessible in Kenya and there should be a considerable ment@@ ality of sport fraud .
IO@@ C member Richard Po@@ und recently called for a similar investigation in Kenya as he had hired her in Russian athle@@ tics .
in doing so , it was possible to prove that this type of sport has been systematically and systematically supp@@ ressed .
Russia &apos;s athletes were then excluded from the summer games .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Salzburg &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; West Side Story &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with Ceci@@ lia Bart@@ oli
in the Shakespeare @-@ Year , the Salzburg Festival presents the &quot; West Side Story &quot; with Tony and Maria as a tragic love couple , similar to Romeo and Juli@@ et .
with a surprising Ceci@@ lia Bart@@ oli .
a musical conqu@@ ers Salzburg : the &quot; West Side Story , &quot; Le@@ orn@@ ard Bern@@ st@@ eins masterpiece .
the artistic director Ceci@@ lia Bart@@ oli wanted to bring the musical into the temple of classical music and fulfilled herself with the role of Maria a teen@@ age mare .
in the orchestra pit the Sim@@ ón Bol@@ í@@ var Orchestra under the direction of the Venezu@@ el@@ an conductor Gust@@ av@@ o Du@@ dam@@ el : &quot; this music is full of rhythm , &quot; he war@@ ms .
we always say that it is very Latin American .
there are many Latin American ingredients in their tempo and melody .
it is a wonderful mixture , the perfect recipe for our orchestra .
I would say that we really have Bernstein &apos;s music in our blood !
in this st@@ aging , Bart@@ oli plays an older Mary .
she rec@@ alls with nostal@@ gia of her love with Tony while the younger Maria is playing and dancing .
the role of Mary has always fascinated me .
first , because it is musi@@ cally exceptional !
and then there would be Maria &apos;s personality .
she says it in her song : &quot; I feel pretty , oh so pretty , I feel pretty and wit@@ ty and bright . &quot;
so it is wise , of course also na@@ ï@@ ve , and very passionate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she is very similar to me , my Italian character , which I have as a Roman , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; laughs Bart@@ oli . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Du@@ dam@@ el is full of praise for the opera singer : &quot; Ceci@@ lia is a wonderful artist . &quot;
it is such an honour to work with her .
it is a tremend@@ ously generous person .
and Bart@@ oli returns the compli@@ ment : &quot; Du@@ dam@@ el is such an exceptional artist and very passionate ! &quot;
conducting is a necessity for him .
one sees it in each of his movements , in his looks , it is his life !
it is such a huge chance to share this musical experience with him .
we both have a rather southern temper@@ ament , a fire , a passion and also a happy approach to life , that is very important at all !
for American director Philip W@@ m . Mc@@ Kin@@ ley is the &quot; West Side Story &quot; up @-@ to @-@ date : &quot; this piece deals with prejudi@@ ces and fan@@ ati@@ cism . &quot;
today we have the refugees , at that time the Pu@@ ert@@ ori@@ ans went to New York , and the New Yor@@ kers did not want them .
they are the same themes and they are just as meaningful as they were back then .
59 years later , the piece is still relevant .
London school@@ girl who joined the IS was killed in Syria
K@@ adi@@ za Sul@@ tana , one of three British school@@ girls who left London last year to join the IS , re@@ port@@ edly died in Syria .
the lawyer Tas@@ ni@@ me Ak@@ un@@ je@@ e said that her family heard about her death in Ra@@ q@@ q@@ a , Syria a few weeks ago .
it was suspected that it was killed by a Russian air attack in Ra@@ q@@ q@@ a , the group &apos;s bul@@ war@@ k in the country , I@@ TV news reported on Thursday .
sul@@ tana was 17 years old and , according to her family , died shortly after she pre@@ tended to leave the war@@ med land and return to England .
&quot; one can only hope that the only good thing lies in it - as warning and warning to others that these are the risks involved in going into a war zone - to stop people from ever making this decision , &quot; Ak@@ un@@ je@@ e said .
in February 2015 , Sul@@ tana and two other school@@ girls from the east of London went to Turkey and then into a bus to the Syrian border .
Sul@@ tan@@ as &apos;s family was told that she married an IS@@ IS fighter in Syria and became a widow within a few months .
Rei@@ d says that Clinton will remain candidates for the Supreme Court in the case of electoral victory at Gar@@ land
Harry Rei@@ d , leader of the Democrats in the Senate , is convinced that the Democrats , H@@ illary Clinton , will nom@@ inate H@@ illary Clinton &apos;s judge Mer@@ ri@@ ck Gar@@ land for the Supreme Court .
the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans in the Senate have blocked Gar@@ lands &apos;s confirmation since its nom@@ ination by Barack Obama in March .
the majority leader in the Senate Mit@@ ch Mc@@ Conn@@ ell believes that the next president will appoint the successor of the dec@@ eased judge at the Supreme Court of Anton@@ in Sc@@ alia .
Rei@@ d said on Thursday during a telephone conference that he expects Clinton to choose Gar@@ land with a certain degree of certainty . &quot;
a spokesperson on Rei@@ d said later that he had not yet talked with Clinton whether she would nom@@ inate Gar@@ land and spec@@ ulate .
he praised Gar@@ land and said that Clinton &apos;s team would not care for un@@ rest with a new candidate .
Gar@@ land is the Supreme Court for the US Court of Appe@@ al for the District of Columbia .
RAID said that Rep@@ ublic@@ ans blocked the nom@@ ination of Latvia , be the lack@@ eys and hel@@ pers of the Republi@@ can presidential candidate , Donald Tr@@ ump .
he also stated that Donald Tr@@ ump is un@@ suitable for the presidential office .
Tre@@ ats wants neck @-@ calendar for &quot; Women and Men &quot;
Tre@@ ats Magazine will work with the photographer David Bell@@ em@@ ere to release a 1970s Pir@@ elli @-@ inspired calendar for 2017 .
but instead of famous naked people , they would like to find the next generation of super@@ models for their N@@ U M@@ uses calendar for 2017 .
at the beginning of this year , the editor @-@ in @-@ chief of Tre@@ ats Steve Sha@@ w told us that his neck magazine differs from ol@@ d@@ school play@@ boys because &quot; Play@@ boy is for men . &quot;
I do this for women .
apparently it is the view that it also does the calendar .
&quot; we must return to the portra@@ yal of timeless and classical nu@@ dity , in which both women and men feel comfortable and feel inspired by these images of a female body , &quot; Sha@@ w said in a press release for the publication of the calendar .
women will want to participate in this project because it is a beautiful work of art .
models can submit their images online or in person with open casting call in Los Angeles and New York .
Turkey : Kurdish community reck@@ ons with mass flight
&quot; whoever doesn &apos;t fit and lob@@ bies Erdo@@ gan is sitting on packed suit@@ cases , &quot; says the Pres@@ i@@ dency of the Gü@@ len @-@ near foundation Di@@ alogue and World , Er@@ can Kar@@ ak@@ oy@@ un .
the Kurdish community of Germany reck@@ ons on short @-@ term with tens of thousands of asylum seekers who flee from Turkey to Germany .
in the medium term , it could even be &quot; some hundred thousand , &quot; says the President of the Alliance Ali Top@@ ra@@ k .
due to the harsh approach of Turkish President Rec@@ ep Tay@@ y@@ ip Erdo@@ gan after the coup attempt , the Kurdish community of Germany expects a mass flight to Germany .
&quot; in the short term , I reck@@ on with tens of thousands , in the medium term with some hundreds of thousands of asylum seekers from Turkey in Germany , if the Erdo@@ gan regime continues to fight the minorities and the democratic opposition , &quot; says the President of the Alliance Ali Top@@ ra@@ k of the &quot; World &quot; of Friday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because the government has already with@@ drew Kurdish strongh@@ olds with sanctions against months , 500@@ ,000 Kur@@ ds are fle@@ eing in Turkey . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the iced coup , secular and op@@ posi@@ tional ethnic Turks were added .
many will have to restart in Europe if they are further supp@@ ressed in Turkey .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it cannot be that a state that assimil@@ ates refugees in their own country , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Top@@ ra@@ k . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the head of the association compl@@ ained of the targeted settlement of Syrian Arabs in Kurdish , but also in al@@ vi@@ tic cities .
thus Erdo@@ gan wants to increase the exit pressure on the remaining Kur@@ ds .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they are the last great minority in Turkey , the Christian Armen@@ ians and Greeks have been eradic@@ ated or displaced in the past hundred years , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Top@@ ra@@ k , who is also a member of the CD@@ U . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the head of the association called for the Federal Government to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; positioned as sharply as Austria against Erdo@@ gan and his followers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Germany too , a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; witch @-@ hunt &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; against Erdo@@ gan critic fires . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I don &apos;t feel safe in Germany for the first time in recent months .
the German branch of the Gü@@ len movement also fears the escape of many Turks abroad .
more Turks are seeking asylum in Germany , especially Kur@@ ds and Op@@ position@@ ists .
the br@@ anding as a Gü@@ len tra@@ der destro@@ ys teachers and other ac@@ adem@@ ics the professional existence .
&quot; whoever does not fit and lob@@ bies Erdo@@ gan sits on packed suit@@ cases , inci@@ dentally also the em@@ alists and sec@@ ular@@ ists , &quot; said Er@@ can Kar@@ ak@@ oy@@ un , president of the Gü@@ len @-@ near foundation Di@@ alogue and Education , the &quot; World . &quot;
as reported by the paper on figures issued by the Federal Ministry of the Interior , the Turks already presented the largest group of asylum holders recognised for political persecution in Germany before the coup .
at the reporting date June 30 , these were 11,@@ 3@@ 86 people and thus almost 29 per cent of all recognised valid for asylum ( 3@@ 9.@@ 6@@ 25 ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in this survey , there is no escape from war , poverty or lack of prospects . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the right to asylum according to the Basic Law are strictly political , i.e. from the state side , individually persecuted .
Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern : &quot; go where it hur@@ ts &quot;
strange Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern : the locals don &apos;t get anything from the summer campaign with - and holi@@ day@@ makers from North Rhine @-@ Westphalia are not allowed to choose the Land@@ tag .
in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern they understood .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in 2021 , the Parliament election will not take place again at the end of the summer holidays , the Schwer@@ in Parliament has already decided at the beginning of the year . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for more stupid than it hasn &apos;t been : summer holidays , heat and country elections - that bites .
the locals , who want to be convinced by the electoral milit@@ ants , are on vacation .
most of the vac@@ ation@@ ers in the country , on U@@ se@@ dom , R@@ ügen or Hid@@ den@@ see are not locals , so don &apos;t choose the Land@@ tag .
there are also practical problems : during holidays , hel@@ pers who hang up posters , infl@@ ate ballo@@ ons , distribute fl@@ yers and en@@ umer@@ ate votes in the end , only pain@@ stak@@ ingly apply .
until September 4 , 2016 , the last day of the election and last holiday day , Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern has once again cont@@ ested its election campaign on the people .
the hot phase , if one can say that at all , has just begun .
and it &apos;s also about something : Prime Minister Er@@ win Sell@@ ering , leader of an SPD / CD@@ U coalition , must be afraid of his office .
the SPD , the strongest party since 1998 , is now clearly behind the CD@@ U in poll@@ s .
exciting is how strongly newcom@@ er Af@@ D cuts off and what remains at the end of co@@ ali@@ tion@@ alism .
Sell@@ ering , 66 years old and head of government since 2008 , makes an almost in@@ con@@ spic@@ uous campaign , one sees from his large posters .
he travels through the country , distri@@ butes roses and ch@@ ats a little with the people , as he did his legendary elo@@ qu@@ ent predecessor Harald Ring@@ storff also .
apart from that , Seel@@ ering has got cold feet and gives Chancellor Merkel the blame on the blossom@@ ing of the Af@@ D .
her refugee policy , her &quot; We create that &quot; has accelerated the rise of the right @-@ wing pop@@ uli@@ sts , which will presumably cost him the beautiful ministry .
the CD@@ U with its top candidate , the interior minister Lor@@ enz C@@ aff@@ ier , has already experienced how it is like when you make a right place at the wrong time .
she has invited chan@@ cell@@ or Angela Merkel to major events twice ; Merkel &apos;s election circuit is located in the northeast .
but the target group did not agree , there were more North Rhine @-@ Westphalia , Berlin and Saxony as Mecklenburg and Vorpommern .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there was probably the majority from other federal states , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; compl@@ ained Vincent Kok@@ ert , Secretary General of the CD@@ U in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern , recently in N@@ DR . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but it doesn &apos;t pity anybody from other corners of Germany to listen to Angela Merkel once .
apart from that , the Nor@@ theast CD@@ U largely disp@@ enses with the usual campaign conditions on market@@ places and shopping m@@ alls with umbrellas and ballo@@ ons .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that , according to Kok@@ ert , plays only a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; subordin@@ ate role &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
also the Union has noticed that on the country you are br@@ anding the base that it needs to be very strict to find a wire to the people again .
you are doing it like the left , the SPD , the Gre@@ ens : there is hardly any place in the expan@@ se of the country .
the Council of the CD@@ U electoral milit@@ ant Kok@@ ert on his fellow campaig@@ ners is also self @-@ expos@@ ing : &quot; they have to go where it hur@@ ts , namely where people are : Dor@@ ff@@ este , Golden Wed@@ dings , every birthday party has to be used . &quot;
because a lot is at stake , Sell@@ ering has now called its SPD to a particularly committed election campaign .
in poll@@ s , the Social Democrats were last at 22 percent behind partner CD@@ U ( 25 ) and just ahead of Af@@ D ( 19 ) .
in the election of 2011 , the SPD won still clearly with 3@@ 5.@@ 6 percent before the CD@@ U ( 22 ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Green Party , a small party with seven percent in the poll@@ s , is likely to make the leap into parliament . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they make a modern virtue out of the necessity of holidays and largely transfer their campaign to the Internet .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; online election campaign , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; calls the president Claudia Müller . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
otherwise , green elec@@ tive warri@@ ors embar@@ k on a search for traces to local voters .
Sil@@ ke Ga@@ je@@ k , the top candidate , cur@@ v@@ ls just with a hous@@ ebo@@ at through the Mecklenburg lakes and also finds it beautiful .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; their impression : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; election holidays in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern is not a punishment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
B@@ 27 Ren@@ ov@@ ation : restaurants suffering from blocking
there is nothing to complain about the speed with which the B 27 is rehabil@@ itated .
for those responsible for the construction work , starting at 5.@@ 30 a.m. and ending at 8 p.m. , there are all praise .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they made everything quite jag@@ ged , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says El@@ vi@@ ra T@@ etz@@ l@@ aff from the Jet @-@ Gas station . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is a super team .
there is no delay .
at the start of the week , the construction site could be reloc@@ ated to the south as planned until the end of October .
v@@ owed will also be the arrival of those responsible for the construction work , for example when it comes to the establishment of lodging entran@@ ces .
since the construction site has mig@@ rated to the south on Monday and also the locking of the asphalt road in O@@ fter@@ d@@ ingen has been abol@@ ished and thus the connection to Rot@@ tenburg is again , the traffic situation within the village has relaxed .
the citizens can now leave the B 27 on both sides by O@@ fter@@ d@@ ingen .
the ev@@ asive way through the place seems to go back .
&quot; there were some considerable complaints , &quot; says the Deputy Head Office , Florian King , responsible for the transport management of the refurb@@ ishment .
the residents of Bach@@ straße , Stein@@ la@@ ch@@ straße , Haf@@ ner@@ straße and Wei@@ her@@ lands had to fight with more traffic noise because many cre@@ eping paths were looking for and more familiar with their Nav@@ i than the signs .
this led to a reduction in some trucks in residential areas .
as the speed limits were not comp@@ lied with , the municipality requested reinfor@@ c@@ ements of the M@@ ös@@ singen measurement vehicle .
&quot; there were significant transgres@@ sions , &quot; says King , who made himself informed about the situation .
two to three per minute have been inj@@ ected .
the fastest was on the road at 77 km / h in the Tempo @-@ 30 zone .
since the construction site has moved on , it has become qui@@ eter .
for the business people at the B 27 it is only a small con@@ sol@@ ation that for customers from Rot@@ tenburg the street is now open .
business people don &apos;t like to look into the cards .
but the fact that the B 27 rehabilitation has led to sales break@@ through@@ s allows anyone to look through .
however , some are more and some less affected .
those who have less to do with the &quot; end customer &quot; are produced for other companies , for whom the rehabilitation has hardly any consequences .
also at the deal@@ ership Ma@@ ier , Thomas Sul@@ z speaks of a &quot; at most slight drop , &quot; but also conce@@ des that of course &quot; the run@@ n@@ shaft is missing . &quot;
the most heavily exploited are the local restaurants along the street .
J. Albert G@@ öh@@ ner , owner of the Ste@@ ak@@ house , formerly crown , finds clear words .
this is already exist@@ ential .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not only him , but all the restaurants &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hard hit &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the customers were missing from H@@ ech@@ ingen , Bal@@ ingen and Rot@@ t@@ weil .
we have to be glad about every Euro turnover .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the revenue losses are reduced to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; far more than 50 percent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the road marking has dropped its operation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for two years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he had to let half of his staff go .
if I had a company with 4000 employees and half had been dismissed , politics would have re@@ acted differently .
instead , District President Jörg Schmidt has responded to a request from G@@ öh@@ ner , if there could be financial compensation , with the hint that the restaurant would otherwise benefit from the advantages of the situation on the B 27 . now , it must also bear the disadvantages resulting from the renovation .
G@@ öh@@ ner knows from other coun@@ ties , where so much more generous has been handled .
with all complaints , G@@ öh@@ ner is confident that his restaurant will continue to exist .
after all , family business has been settled here since 17@@ 15 , he refers to the long history .
he can understand that other regular guests are less frequent due to complicated traffic management .
if you can &apos;t ride , it is also somewhere else nice .
G@@ öh@@ ner has no doubt that his family clientele returns after the end of the renovation work .
despite the crises with BSE and avian influ@@ enza , G@@ öh@@ ner considers the effects of the B 27 construction works on his clientele for the biggest crisis , which has experienced its restaurant in its long history .
six months of construction work , that &apos;s already brutal .
it is constantly bol@@ ted to laws in the name of the fight against terrorism .
after the recent attacks , Interior Minister de Ma@@ izi@@ ère now presents a thick security package .
but what to do with terror ?
and what does the coalition partner say to all this ?
Thomas de Ma@@ izi@@ ère gives the reconc@@ iled .
all his proposals are politically reasonable to the coalition partner , &quot; says the Federal Minister of the Interior in the presentation of his new security package .
they don &apos;t overwhel@@ m anybody .
other , further points would initially be discussed within the parties .
I also take part in it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but as Minister of the Interior he was placed on results and in a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; re@@ cover@@ able consensus &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; within the coalition . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the recent attacks in Würzburg and Ans@@ bach , de Ma@@ izi@@ ère had a little time to pass before he presented his conclusions for safety in the Republic .
but they are all the more extensive .
some things have already been announced , announced , filed : that a new security agency is to take care of the cra@@ cking of encrypted communication is not new .
nor is it the fact that Germany has to implement several EU directives on passenger data and weapons law .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the call for more video surveillance and personnel for security authorities is also not surprising . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in part , de Ma@@ izi@@ ère is starting a second run for proposals that have not been done with the SPD so far : he wants to put sympathy for terrorist groups under penalty and kno@@ ck jihadi@@ sts with double nationality the German passport .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these will be difficult points for the SPD , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; conce@@ des the CD@@ U man . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he still considers this to be reasonable and doesn &apos;t demand anything that has no chances in the coalition partner anyway .
a few new ideas also present de Ma@@ izi@@ ère .
some of them have it in themselves : he plans quick procedures for deport@@ ations and more possibilities to incar@@ cer@@ ate people before deportation .
refugees that are targeted at the country should check their smartphones before and open social media accounts for a security audit .
in case of divor@@ ce for rejected asylum seekers , he wants to make some even worse than before - for example those who commit crimes or deliberately throw away their documents in order to obsc@@ ure their identity .
some of them are politically and legally delicate .
many things still have an impact and leave any questions open .
and at some points - in the un@@ equal treatment of patients , for example - the question arises : what does this actually have to do with security and terror ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yes , says de Ma@@ izi@@ ère , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is important to differentiate between the subjects refugees and terror . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but it cannot be said that the attacks were refugees from Ans@@ bach and Würzburg .
in addition , many people were worried about security in the face of the high number of refugees .
and things that pro@@ found@@ ly employed people were not cl@@ inging to election periods .
the inner security has shifted tremend@@ ously into the focus .
only the attacks in the neighborhood : Paris , Copenhagen , Brussels , Nice .
then the attacks in Würzburg and Ans@@ bach .
the uncertainty is great .
and yes , there are electoral campaigns .
the Union and the SPD are therefore increasingly in position in the subject of internal security .
in the past few days , there was a high level between the two parties .
only a stub@@ born argument about the equipment of the Federal Police , then about a security policy collection of some Uni@@ ons Interior Minister , in which the departments also demand a Bur@@ ka ban and a turning away from dual citizenship .
de Ma@@ izi@@ ère also strug@@ gled here for conci@@ li@@ atory sounds .
he has nothing to stop from a double @-@ pass .
we have set up the discussion in Germany .
to re@@ make you new is not useful .
and with a Bur@@ ka ban he has constitutional concerns .
whether its own package is constitu@@ tionally un@@ constitutional at all corners and whether it is actually &quot; reasonable &quot; for the coalition partner , only must show itself .
there is a lot in it , which could cause quar@@ rels .
but the SPD , too , is currently trying to benefit from internal security .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Part@@ eich@@ ef Sig@@ mar Gabriel clearly signals the willingness to talk and says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the SPD is ready to talk about everything that contributes to further enhancing safety . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
still Volkswagen comes through .
despite diesel @-@ sc@@ andal , the delivery figures world @-@ wide increase .
but it does not run around in all markets .
in the recall action , there is vor@@ ti@@ ces about a term .
Volkswagen starts with deliveries in the second half of the year .
despite the diesel engine , Europe &apos;s largest car manufacturer can continue to show a plus despite the diesel engine thanks to its many brands and some well @-@ running markets .
but in July the core brand VW f@@ ain@@ ted above all in Western Europe and thus weighed down the total sales , as the company noted in the D@@ ax .
in July , the VW brand sold 1.8 percent less vehicles in July with 44@@ 9@@ 100 cars than in the previous year &apos;s month .
in Western Europe alone , after China , the second most important market , sales were 14 percent below the previous year &apos;s month .
in Germany &apos;s home market , deliveries declined by almost one sixth .
market leader Jürgen St@@ ack@@ mann reduced the weaker figures from July mainly to two sales days less in Europe .
in addition , there was a purchase reserve in some core markets through &quot; changed economic conditions . &quot;
in addition to the situation around the tur@@ key test in Turkey , the British vote also bur@@ dened the exit from the EU , explained a spokes@@ woman .
in the USA , where the exhaust air was first calibr@@ ated , a minus is also available .
great support for VW is the Chinese market .
all in all , the mainly affected domestic brand of Lower Saxony is still further wor@@ sen@@ ed by the diesel sc@@ andal : after the first seven months , only an extra@@ dition minus of 0.@@ 9 percent is expected to increase to 3.@@ 37 million vehicles .
group sales manager Fred Kap@@ pler was able to present a sales increase from January to July .
at this time , Volkswagen delivered 1.3 percent more vehicles , around 5,@@ 9@@ 04 million worldwide .
Volkswagen had been manipul@@ ating gas tests with a software .
in Germany alone , VW is calling for some 2.5 million vehicles to upgrade to the workshops .
in the course of the upgrade VW reiter@@ ated that the conversion of the cars has no negative effects .
after the modification of the vehicles , there is no deterioration in fuel consumption , CO2 emissions or engine performance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after ref@@ itting a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; guaranteed &quot; certificate , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I do not speak of a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; guarantee &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Friday in corporate circles . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the reason for this is legal sub@@ t@@ le@@ ties .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Focus &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; had reported that Volkswagen now grants its German customers a guarantee of well @-@ equipped diesel models . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this would have confirmed VW representatives in the Federal Ministry of Transport last Monday .
from the Ministry of Transport it was confirmed that there was this meeting .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; VW has fully comply with the requirements of my Insp@@ ection Commission and the KBA . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; deviations from this are not accepted , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Federal Minister for Transport Alexander Do@@ br@@ ind@@ t ( CS@@ U ) according to the ministry . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
VW has assumed the guarantee that fuel consumption , CO2 emissions or engine performance do not deterior@@ ate after the conversion and all relevant vehicle values remain unchanged .
Volkswagen himself uses the term &quot; guarantee &quot; but not as it was called in corporate circles .
with the wide term &quot; warranty , &quot; Volkswagen sees the possibility that for example , customers can come to a workshop for example half a year after the conversion - and this could lead to the new software , even if the damage has nothing to do with it .
also in the interest of customers it is important to avoid any other damages which have nothing to do with the exhaust gas sc@@ andal , as regards possible warranty regulations , as it was said .
therefore VW does not use the term &quot; guarantee . &quot;
Rai@@ ff@@ ei@@ sen@@ bank G@@ mund am T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see demands pen@@ insul@@ as from rich savers - as a second institute in Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; boss Josef Paul said on Thursday : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s only about 139 customers who park 40 million euros on sight deposits or day money accounts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Federal Association of German B@@ anks speaks of an individual case and does not see a signal in it : &quot; normal savers &quot; should not be afraid of paying for their austerity measures . &quot;
if banks are deposited money over night at the European Central Bank ( ECB ) , they must pay their 0.4 percent pen@@ al interest .
this fee is required by Rai@@ ff@@ ei@@ sen@@ bank G@@ mund in September of private and corporate customers for deposits over 100,000 euros on checking or day money accounts .
&quot; the first 100,000 euros are free . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the next 100.000 costs will cost 400 euros in the year , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Paul . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for some time now , he be@@ ware 40 million euros , which could be withdrawn from one day to the other and which he could not utilize .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they lie with me on the central bank account and cause 0.4 percent of cost , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Head of the Bank . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I cannot lie down for every million Euros . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to the pol@@ lu@@ ter principle , the costs are now further reduced .
leaving the cash in the Rai@@ ff@@ ei@@ sen@@ bank saf@@ es would be far too dangerous : &quot; I have already experienced four ra@@ ids , I don &apos;t like the fifth ! &quot; said the Bank Chief .
most customers would have understanding and changed to other forms of investment .
only a few emig@@ rated to other banks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the federation of Co@@ operatives declared : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the ECB &apos;s extreme monetary policy course causes considerable costs for all banks . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you alone , be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; economically viable &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
some German banks have therefore increased their account management fees , credit cards or transfers .
the Thur@@ in@@ gian Volks@@ bank and Rai@@ ff@@ ei@@ sen@@ bank Alten@@ burger Land has made head@@ lines with its Sk@@ at@@ bank branch in 2014 with pen@@ alties for deposits from three million euros .
Michael K@@ em@@ mer , Chief Executive Officer of the Banking Union , said : &quot; we don &apos;t expect private customers to pay nationwide fees for deposits , and the competition in Germany is far too strong among banks and savings banks . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a ban@@ ker said at the T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see there is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a clientele that is more abund@@ antly equipped by the property . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this can be a problem for a small bank , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if they are free money . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
founded in 1911 , G@@ mund has branches in Bad Wies@@ see , Rot@@ t@@ ach @-@ E@@ gern , Kre@@ uth and T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; cooperative federation of Bavaria &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is currently not known to other banks that charge a compensation for deposits of private customers , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said spokes@@ man Ernst . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the President of the Bundes@@ verband der deutschen Volks@@ banken and Rai@@ ff@@ ei@@ sen@@ banken ( B@@ VR ) , Uwe Fr@@ öh@@ lich , had declared at the end of June : &quot; the threshold of going into neg@@ atives compared to private customers is very , very high . &quot;
the competition is hard , and the migration of investors to competition threat@@ ens .
customers in Germany will not like that in width .
destination Boards : who &apos;s buying records ?
lonely middle @-@ aged men love plates .
before comm@@ enting to the comment section , in order to conc@@ eal it under the pseu@@ don@@ ym of non @-@ aven@@ ue of men &apos;s middle @-@ aged men with harsh insul@@ ts , this statement deri@@ ves from actual data .
according to You@@ Go@@ v , the many @-@ discussed resur@@ gence of records cannot be attributed to a boom in mill@@ enni@@ als , who want to welcome the news of physical objects , but to Mid@@ life nostal@@ gia .
those who recently bought a record are all for@@ esi@@ ght between 45 and 54 .
in fact , the age group of 18 @-@ 24 is the most likely buyer group .
there is also no hor@@ des by hobby collectors - it has an emotional meaning : older record buyers rather keep their feelings for themselves ( 56 % vs. 53 % ) and enjoy spending time alone ( 69 % vs. 66 % ) .
but do the results of You@@ Go@@ v match ?
if this blog is a news report on TV , the camera would follow me while I run in the middle of a busy street in Soh@@ o , wear a modest grey suit and ro@@ ar wild@@ ly before I stop , keep my hands and say something more intimate like : &quot; so let &apos;s take a closer look at it . &quot;
so , let &apos;s take a look at it .
even though the heart of Soh@@ o slowly stands in its charm - hotels , restaurants and offices are now filling the buildings in which once independent sellers were located - there is still a handful of fantastic plate specialty shops .
I would probably ask the c@@ amer@@ aman to switch the camera off for the next part in which I stand in close proximity to various men in such stores and try to judge their age and mind through observation .
Stu@@ art from Glas@@ gow , 55 , I am from Si@@ ster Ray ( Number of data : two young women , three middle @-@ aged men ) to Rec@@ kl@@ ess Records ( Number of data : eight middle @-@ aged men , a woman , probably around 20 ) , is a day long because of a meeting in London and goes through the shops to fill the few hours .
is he a collector , I ask ?
&quot; I guess , &quot; he says .
I have about 3,000 or 4.000 plates .
these records , pic@@ tured above ( he sent me the snapshot by e @-@ mail , I did not follow him home ) , dress the walls of his living room .
the reason why he has such a considerable number of albums and sing@@ les is the result of his available income : he is now able to buy records he could not afford when she appeared and re @-@ buy items he sold when he was young and broke .
&quot; many things I buy are from the late 60s , early 70s , which appeared when I was 11 or 12 . things in which I was probably something too young to buy them , &quot; he says .
he agrees that those who buy records are rather intro@@ ver@@ ted and would like to spend time alone , and adds : &quot; I don &apos;t smoke and I don &apos;t drink very much .
this is my vice .
WE@@ Z , 25 , who works with Si@@ ster Ray , also believes that many customers that he meets can apply to the You@@ Go@@ v profile .
but he also noticed a new wave of people who are influenced by the media , people who heard about the com@@ eback and are forced to buy their old records again .
from the conversations I have conducted , people usually get rid of their collection in 1998 or 1999 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; customers who once sold their records to buy CDs are now selling their CDs to buy their records again , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this would explain the boom to tra@@ ilers of a certain age .
but what about the alleged emotional importance of records ?
it takes only a few seconds in a shop like F@@ oll@@ onica to see that record shops offer a cal@@ ming community of like @-@ minded people .
according to WE@@ Z , some of the older customer contacted the cont@@ ac@@ tless payment system .
some record fans feel overwhel@@ med by the digital world and want to retreat to the stability of familiar vinyl covers , of objects that call for happy memories .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think sometimes it can be the filling of a void or property of material possessions as a kind of comfort , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says WE@@ Z . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is for me as a collector so and I think it &apos;s so with many people .
it is a simple way to mentally engage .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are like their social workers ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; an employee flo@@ ats from a stack of plates . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
an IC@@ M survey in April revealed that almost 50 % of people who bought a record last month have not yet listened to .
the survey also found that 41 % have a record player that they never use , while 7 % of those who purchase a record are not having a record player .
at this time of the news report I would probably look very worried while looking through a pile of bos@@ sa nov@@ a comp@@ il@@ ations .
Jon@@ ny , 42 , who works at Sounds of the Universe ( Number of data : three middle @-@ aged men ) has noticed a &quot; tro@@ phy aspect &quot; of the Revi@@ val .
&quot; someone just came here recently and said , &quot; I don &apos;t have a record player , but I &apos;d like to buy a Radi@@ oh@@ ead Records , so that I can put them on the shelf , &quot; he says .
this is not a big percentage , but it definitely happens .
more product @-@ sensitive , less musi@@ c@@ astic .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have people who say : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have no record player . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
these are younger people , not older ones , who first come in slowly .
opp , which has devoted almost a whole floor to the sound plates , has a b@@ lower audience when I go in .
there are couples around 70 , tourists who take photos , teen@@ age boys and middle @-@ aged women .
even though the atmosphere is slightly less relaxed than in the above shops - Wild Be@@ asts &apos;s latest syn@@ th@@ esi@@ ology and extract @-@ packed pop instead of experimental jazz we@@ ars out of the loudspeakers - it is good to see such diversity among the customers .
none of them looks strange , but the psychological trauma is difficult to det@@ ectable if you stand beside someone for 30 seconds .
E@@ lan@@ ora , 27 , has been in business for a few minutes and considers the variety of plates available for sale .
it rather makes a window @-@ shopping as a big shopping .
it does not earn much , so collecting records is not a real option , she says .
it costs a lot .
it is easy to listen to music from a computer or in a different way , but the beauty of records is ... &quot; she drives off with a de@@ ar@@ est si@@ gh .
I don &apos;t know how to explain it - it &apos;s really unique .
my last stop is a business that is said to have inspired a new generation of record lovers : urban out@@ fit@@ ters .
while I &apos;m preten@@ ding to wear jeans in pants , I watch a group of young teen@@ age girls group@@ ing around Pol@@ aro@@ id cameras for a moment before a father and his daughter think about buying a cros@@ ley record player .
on the left there is a staircase , a wall full of records of Adel@@ e , Jeff Buck@@ ley , A@@ my Win@@ ehouse and Fle@@ et@@ wood Mac : a mix of contemporary music and classics , the essential panels for an average collection .
nobody can see them - maybe because they are purely decorative , some so far above that it is impossible to touch them .
it is pure &quot; record art . &quot;
but considering that every attraction for these items would mean more money for the industry and some customers could send some customers to the depths of Soh@@ o there is nothing to complain .
it is no surprise that a population group that has more time and money than others , is also the one that is most used for luxury items such as plates .
even if my research shows that the results of You@@ Go@@ v vote , they leave , at least in record stores in Soh@@ o , the large number of female collectors that exist in reality , record stores and online forums .
these people are probably working hard at school or in offices .
they won &apos;t spend their Thursday morning security with the stroll through the record shops of Ber@@ wick Street and the leaves by plates , while they avoid the star@@ ing gaze of an unc@@ anny , 30 @-@ year @-@ old false pres@@ enter who rises above the shoulders of uns@@ us@@ p@@ ecting middle @-@ aged men .

French Court re@@ jects quote on demo@@ lition of shops in the jungle refugee camp
a French court rejected an offer by the authorities in Cal@@ ais , dozens of temporary shops and restaurants in the jungle of Cal@@ ais , where thousands of refugees live .
during a trial hearing this week , the authorities argued in Cal@@ ais that the state should be able to break down 72 temporary businesses in which individuals within the camp sell goods , from cigar@@ ettes to En@@ erg@@ y@@ drinks , sell bar@@ ber services or sell tea for 50 c@@ ents ( 40 p@@ ence ) or simple meals for a few euros in temporary restaurants .
the Cal@@ ais pre@@ f@@ ecture argued that these places were to be demol@@ ished because they would represent a parallel economy from which no taxes would be paid and which would provide a fire and san@@ ity risk .
humanitarian groups told the court that the shops and restaurants were important , as the free meals offered by the feder@@ ally supported Association and other groups would not provide enough food for the growing numbers in the camp .
they also concluded that temporary businesses and restaurants would often offer accommodation and free meals for people in need .
a court in L@@ ille decided that there would be no legal basis for the expul@@ sion of people who run the 72 temporary businesses , but admitted that the concerns of the Cal@@ ais pre@@ f@@ ecture are absolutely understandable . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; judge Jean @-@ François M@@ oll@@ a said that food stores , cafes and restaurants would play a much greater role than just feeding people living in extremely prec@@ arious conditions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said that the areas offer quiet meeting points between refugees and volunteers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
one of the places threatened by the tear@@ oom was the Jung@@ le Book Kids &apos; Café of the camp , which is operated in a community and offers 200 meals a day , English and French classes as well as advice on asylum cases for the hundreds of vulnerable , un@@ accompanied min@@ ors in the camp .
more than 17@@ 0.000 people have signed the petition to preserve the Kids &apos; Café .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a letter to the Guardian , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the closure &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for these children would be a catastrophe , of which the youngest eight years are old . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the two relief organizations Help Refu@@ ge@@ es and L &apos;@@ Au@@ berge des Mig@@ rants estimated on Friday that the number of people living in the jungle camp had risen to over 9@@ ,000 people - the highest number to now - after a steep increase of newcom@@ ers in the course of summer .

here comes the Enfor@@ cement trailer
Germany &apos;s rac@@ ers must adapt to the next generation speed meas@@ ur@@ ers : in various federal states , including in Hessen and Brandenburg , new flash@@ es are tested , which are supposed to be particularly effective .
the futur@@ istic Enfor@@ cement tra@@ ilers of the company Vit@@ ronic from Wiesbaden can , for example , be used in accident areas , where it would be too dangerous for a mobile measurement by the police .
for example , at highway construction sites or to rehabil@@ itating bridges with a temporary speed limit , there are often no necessary infrastructure in order to ensure compliance with speed limits .
however , a permanent mobile construction can be too dangerous or costly .
Enfor@@ cement Tra@@ iler is self @-@ sufficient : during continuous measurement , its battery lasts five days , the case data is transmitted encrypted over a modem .
laser measuring technology can also detect all vehicles across multiple tracks simultaneously .
variable speed limits as well as access b@@ ans after time , travel strips and vehicle class can also be monitored .
in the state @-@ of @-@ the @-@ art condition , it is possible to move the trailer according to the manufacturer with each car with trailer hit@@ ch .
in order that it is not simply cl@@ utter@@ ed , it is lowered in the measurement mode , so that the wheels disappear in the ar@@ mor@@ ed and by the way also a non @-@ slip shell .
a built @-@ in alarm system should also protect the gl@@ itter against v@@ and@@ alism .
since 2015 , the trailer has been tested according to information from Vit@@ ronic in various federal states and is now also used .
even foreign authorities are flash@@ ing with the new technology : recently France has ordered 100 copies , after an order of 150 units last year .
great Britain re@@ covers Silver in 7 @-@ er Ru@@ g@@ by after Fi@@ ji master@@ class gold fet@@ ches
the impressive achievement of Britain at 7 @-@ 7 rug@@ by came to an ab@@ rupt halt at the last hur@@ dle in the form of Fi@@ j@@ is , when they were hit in Rio with a result of 43 @-@ 7 in the De@@ odor@@ o Stadium .
Fi@@ ji issued a master class in handling , Side @-@ Step@@ ping , back @-@ back , line run and raw power to win Gold - their first Olympic medal of any color .
the defeat was missed due to the not too bad tro@@ phy of the silver medal - Britain &apos;s fourth on that day - and they could be quite proud of their efforts in this tournament in which they beat New Zealand , Argentina and South Africa .
the clear defeat of the Bo@@ ks , 7 @-@ 5 in the semi@@ fin@@ als on the same day could fall back on them in the final .
but irrespective of this , Fi@@ ji could have put a 15 @-@ man @-@ team in best shape in this form .
it could be a con@@ sol@@ ation for GB - but it probably won &apos;t - that at least a Brit@@ on will have a gold medal around his neck tomorrow : Fi@@ j@@ is head coach Ben Ry@@ an , former boss for England from Wim@@ ble@@ don .
GB had a difficult path behind it .
eight years ago , under Ry@@ an , she lost every game at the Adel@@ ai@@ de Sev@@ ens .
here they just lost one .
this hat@@ ch will hurt , but progress is amazing .
Fi@@ ji began mira@@ cul@@ ously and let the attacks boun@@ ce out of fun .
it felt for captain Tom Mit@@ ch@@ ell and Co. as if they were running in running buses . the World Series winners went 5 @-@ 0 upwards , when O@@ sea Kol@@ in@@ is@@ au fro@@ ze in the corner .
with still four minutes of playing , Jer@@ ry Tu@@ v@@ i added another attack from the right corner he turned around .
12 @-@ 0 and GB hardly touched the ball .
a su@@ c@@ cul@@ ent T@@ ackle of Mit@@ ch@@ ell stopped the mountain of man Leone N@@ ak@@ ar@@ awa to score a third gate , but it just stopped Fi@@ ji .
in the seventh minute lete j@@ asa Ver@@ em@@ alu@@ a left a touch down in the right corner and it stood 0 @-@ 17 for GB .
N@@ ak@@ ar@@ awa added a new one since the re@@ play and there was still more than a minute playing time ... in the first half .
V@@ atem@@ o Rav@@ ou@@ vo@@ u pres@@ sured through other weak tac@@ kl@@ ings of the GB team and rush@@ ed to the line to make a gate .
the conversion brought a 29 @-@ 0 to a break .
it &apos;s as if Fi@@ ji was born to play 7 , while GB is still learning .
that &apos;s the way it is .
GB led basic changes to the half @-@ time and closed the fi@@ ji@@ anian void ... for four minutes , which was good for the circumstances of the first half until Joshua passed Tu@@ is@@ ova after a brilliant stop@@ over of Fi@@ ji .
Dan Nor@@ ton started an attempt for GB , made a touch down in the left corner for a 36 @-@ 7 , but the game was long in favor of the South se@@ ein@@ sul@@ ans , whose fans s@@ ang@@ ed , flags wave and d@@ anced on the tri@@ b@@ une .
it was not difficult to admire the playful approach of Fi@@ j@@ is .
Mat@@ a V@@ ili@@ ame replaced the icing on the cake with another try in the last few seconds .
the fi@@ j@@ is sounded , the Fi@@ j@@ is embra@@ ced and GB ti@@ d@@ ded crush@@ ingly in the grass .
earlier on the day , Fi@@ ji conquered Japan in the semi @-@ fin@@ als with 20 @-@ 5 and Britain pushed South Africa in a short semi @-@ fin@@ al@@ match of the race - Britain &apos;s conversion of difference .
K@@ yle Brown brought the Bo@@ ks forward in the first half , but Dan Nor@@ ton broke through the line with an impressive foot@@ work and scored a gate among the posts in the second half .
a brilliant late tac@@ kling by Marcus Wat@@ son , brother of Anthony the English 15 @-@ A@@ side Team , secured the win - and thus the silver medal .
Hel@@ en Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning inspired by the fight with the trainer &apos;s cancer
there will be no more em@@ bl@@ ematic gold than with these games and that will mean something .
from the first stroke to the last , 220 hard H@@ ieve that enter history , Hel@@ en Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning have found an additional meaning in their golden moment at the Est@@ acio da Lag@@ oa .
even though there were only those who sat at the ru@@ dder , there were three voices in the boat . the echo of the coach Robin Williams was all present when they row@@ ed to the second Olympics in the second without a tax wife , the first women in the history of British sports , who laid such a standard .
her domin@@ ance was absolutely , after all , her 3@@ 9.@@ ter un@@ defeated assignment , which is also unprecedented .
what we see are two brilliant female athletes , who gli@@ de over the surface with the elegance of sw@@ ans , which does not reflect the nature of the triumph .
behind every gold in the herd is a batt@@ ali@@ on of willing hel@@ pers who make the difference and it was no more Acces@@ sible than the coach who did not know 30 months ago if he would survive this day when he was diagnosed with cancer .
as he said he ris@@ ky .
I had bladder cancer that is oper@@ able and that did it .
if you do not do that , it spreads everywhere .
it would have been a pretty serious situation .
it changes a little the outlook .
Williams was diagnosed in December 2013 .
the trio was lucky that he was able to start treatment at the beginning of 2014 , out of season , which kept the interruption to a minimum , in the event that under such circumstances is the right term .
I needed money , so I had to go better soon .
it was an incentive .
I was in hospital and walked around the station - 20 feet , 30 feet , 50 feet at a time when they said that some steps would be sufficient .
so it begins .
rowing itself is a challenge , but that makes it an even bigger one .
in the immedi@@ acy of victory , their first thoughts went to Williams who spent a busy morning doing something more than usual and trying to process his own fears .
p@@ anning , which was a captain in the Royal Arti@@ llery Regi@@ ment in a deployment in Afghanistan , said &quot; I was an emotional wre@@ ck this week . that &apos;s maybe something extreme , but it means so much . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it only repe@@ ats how much I have been working with and hel@@ en and Robin . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there were three fantastic years with Hel@@ en and Robin .
without Robin we would be no one , so a massive thank you to him . he is the best trainer in the world .
I couldn &apos;t have wished for a better person for training or a better trainer .
Helena Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning have not lost any race over the past five years .
the couple had a hard rhythm with which their opponents could not keep up .
even in the last 500 meters , when the teams from New Zealand and Denmark started to catch up , St@@ anning and Glo@@ ver had too much in reserve .
we were very trapped in the moment .
Hel@@ en called &quot; stay in the process , stay in the process . &quot;
it is really important not to let yourself be carried away .
we had a good start and at the same time we were not eager to do something T@@ oll@@ es .
we didn &apos;t want fire@@ works today , we just wanted to get a good result , go out and win the race , which we did .
the couple will take a break for one year before making decisions about his future .
Glo@@ ver must appear next week on a wedding , her own with the TV advent@@ urer Steve Back@@ shall .
now she just wants to enjoy the moment .
I didn &apos;t want to say that it was my last race .
that would have meant too much pressure .
in London , it took about six months to understand that I am an Olympic champion .
it was all so new for me and I was stressed .
it took about four minutes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it feels so much better , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
exemplary clarity ensured for 31 years
the managing director of the &quot; V@@ ei@@ ten@@ stein@@ gruppe , &quot; Rup@@ pert Gö@@ ller , reti@@ res .
the association is regarded as &quot; Bavarian &quot; exemplary . &quot;
a small Fran@@ con@@ ian drinking water association as a model for large water producers .
this was the name of the Bavarian Radio some time ago .
a little later , the water forum of the government of Lower Fran@@ con@@ ia appreciated the purpose of the association .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the work of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; bay@@ ern &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is exemplary &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
behind all this is Ru@@ pert Schach@@ ller , who was employed for 31 years in the Emplo@@ yer @-@ Emplo@@ yer , 28 years as Managing Director .
he was now retired at the age of 65 .
the Dr@@ inking Water Authority of the V@@ ei@@ ten@@ stein@@ gruppe with its headquarters in Kot@@ ten@@ dorf , municipality Breit@@ brun@@ n , promotes approximately 150@@ ,000 cubic metres of water annually and supplies 32 places and ham@@ lets with approximately 5@@ 500 inhabitants .
member municipalities are the municipalities Kirch@@ brun@@ n , Breit@@ brun@@ n , Lau@@ ter , E@@ bel@@ s@@ bach and the town of Ba@@ un@@ ach .
there are water supply contracts for further cities and municipalities .
the current chair@@ woman , Breit@@ brun@@ n Bürger@@ meister@@ ei Ger@@ tru@@ d Büh@@ l ( F@@ W ) , reminded that Ru@@ pert Schach@@ ller was hired as a water wart in 1985 and was appointed Managing Director of the Bet@@ ting Association in 1988 .
&quot; his tasks have been very diverse and they extended from water management and maintenance work on office and organizational activities , budget planning , calculation of fees and contributions to emergency operations on weekends , &quot; said the chairman .
as outstanding events , she called the inauguration and inauguration of the new wells ( 1994 ) , land purchases in the area of the new wells ( 1998 ) and compensation of farmers , the renovation of the high containers ( 1999 ) , the re@@ purchase of a central computer control system ( 2004 ) and the re@@ development of water pipes .
there have been no stand@@ still and I have always added new additions , because water is food and drinking water is the most important food .
in her lau@@ dation she praised Gö@@ ll@@ ers faithful , reliable and correct service for over 31 years .
he has applied himself with a lot of heart blood for his water @-@ purpose @-@ association and he has lived the water @-@ purpose association regularly as if it were his own company .
a few weeks ago , as a real practitioner , he was allowed to present the success concept of the V@@ ei@@ ten@@ stein@@ gruppe for nit@@ rate reduction in front of the water forum of the Lower Fran@@ con@@ ia district .
for that he received very much praise and praise .
Ru@@ pert Schach@@ ller , on the one hand , praised Al@@ f@@ ons G@@ rie@@ bel , who worked with him for 28 years .
he is the best water keeper and he was a faithful boy .
together we were an unbe@@ atable team .
as a highlight from his point of view , he called the well @-@ being and the restructuring of the association .
the biggest challenge and the most difficult deployment were the demo@@ lition of the elevated tank at Kirch@@ ner on a third of January .
at minus 17 degrees all night had to be worked so that the villages could be supplied with water .
also the supply of Neu@@ brun@@ n once could only be maintained , because one filled the high containers of P@@ ett@@ stadt with hoses .
the management of the drinking water association was handed over to Daniel Stür@@ mer from Lau@@ ter , who succ@@ eeds Ru@@ pert Schach@@ ller .
the soprano Anna Net@@ reb@@ ko is open to the au@@ tism of her son Ti@@ ago - and turns to other affected parents : &quot; you must have the courage to talk about it . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; medicine has made great progress , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the 44 @-@ year @-@ old Italian newspaper &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Cor@@ riere della Ser@@ a . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when the disease had been recognized by her son , she believed that she must die . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

relationship at Bar@@ g@@ t@@ eh@@ ei@@ de - man shooting at partner of life
a 35 @-@ year @-@ old man shot at a multi @-@ family house in Bar@@ g@@ t@@ eh@@ ei@@ de ( district Stor@@ mar@@ n ) on Friday at 10.@@ 45 o &apos;clock in a multi @-@ family house in Bar@@ g@@ t@@ eh@@ ei@@ de ( district Stor@@ mar@@ n ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the man inv@@ oked and told us to have shot his partner , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a police spokes@@ woman . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the perpetr@@ ator is on the run , and after him I will be publicly prosec@@ uted .
now nationwide because Sven S. could be traveling by car .
the man is about 1.80 meters tall , muscular , brown @-@ fired and has a bald head .
meanwhile the police released a photo of him .
it is , however , a few years old .
meanwhile the man is wearing a bald head .
the man should not be addressed directly .
he could still carry the weapon with him , like the police .
the one who sees Sven S. is supposed to call 110 .
the police speak of a &quot; relationship . &quot;
the victim was born in 1988 , the perpetr@@ ator in 1981 .
the responsible police in Lü@@ beck initially did not want to provide information on the day or the relationship between perpetr@@ ators and victims ; however , it confirmed that a person had been killed .
&quot; it is a killing crime . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we do not say more at this time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a police spokes@@ woman in Lü@@ beck . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to e@@ ye@@ witnesses , a special command@@ o command@@ o ( SE@@ K ) was at the scene of crime .
steel - Licht@@ blick for German steel industry
the crisis @-@ torn and energy @-@ intensive German steel industry remains unaffected by additional costs in the millions .
financial burdens that the industry faces from green electricity production are from the table .
the German Steel Industry Minister Sig@@ mar Gabriel ( SPD ) of the &quot; West@@ deutsche Allgemeine Zeitung &quot; ( SPD ) of the &quot; West German Allgemeine Zeitung &quot; ( WA@@ Z , Friday edition ) remained in the German steel industry .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am really happy that we could finally reach tough negotiations after two years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
as a result , the European Commission had initially planned to ask the steel producers who use gases from the blast furnace for generating electricity for their own consumption .
according to the German industry association , the steel industry threatened an additional cost of 120 to 240 million euros per year .
Gabriel stressed the WA@@ Z , there is now a draft agreement with the European Commission after talks with Commissioner Mar@@ gre@@ the V@@ est@@ ager .
only when the generators are replaced in the steel mills , an EEG lev@@ y of 20 percent falls .
but even this will not be raised in the steel industry .
IG Metall welcomed Germany &apos;s unification with the European Commission on self @-@ power generation .
in this way , the status quo of the previous arrangement is largely recorded .
Gabriel &apos;s successful efforts for the steel industry have a special significance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in view of our &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; steel &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; campaign , this is a first step . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; more must follow . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; even in the reform of emissions trading , climate and employment targets are to be weighed down , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stated IG Metall boss Jörg Hof@@ mann in Frankfurt . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the steel industry in Europe has suffered from over@@ capacity and considerable price pressure since the financial crisis in 2008 .
last year , the situation increased further than the world &apos;s largest producer in China threw massive steel on the world market in light of the weak@@ ening domestic demand .
European manufacturers acc@@ use Chinese steel companies price dump@@ ing .
in the course of this spring , the situation has eased a little .
on the one hand , import duties imposed on import steel are showing effect , on the other hand the economic prospects in China have risen .
it is not clear how sustainable the price collection is .
German industry pri@@ mus Th@@ ys@@ senk@@ ru@@ pp was cau@@ tious on Thursday .
last but not least , the prices would have been stagn@@ ating .
the industry responds to the difficult situation with further cost reductions .
finally Th@@ ys@@ sen@@ Kru@@ pp did not want to exclude the closure of individual works .
around 8@@ 6000 people were employed in the German steel industry at the end of 2015 .
in July , the German steel manufacturers are cau@@ tious despite rising prices and increasing orders .
with 3.4 million tonnes , they produced a good six percent less crude steel than in the previous year &apos;s month , as the Steel Business Unit communicated on Friday .
after a short up@@ li@@ ft@@ ment in May , the produced quantity left behind each other for the second month .
since the beginning of the year , production has been down two percent below the previous year &apos;s figure .
the association expects an improved job situation in the coming months thanks to an improved order situation .
community , spirit , health : singing does sen@@ iors good
Ur@@ sel Ki@@ pp had already accompanied her whole life : as a young girl she was in the school choir , she occupied the subject of music in the school choir , and today the 78 @-@ year @-@ old sings in a senior choir .
&quot; singing moves me - emotion@@ ally and physically , &quot; she describes .
after a rehear@@ sal , she feels balanced , cheerful and overall alive , she says .
by the way , she does something good for her health and mind .
because singing is a great hobby for sen@@ iors , Er@@ hard H@@ ac@@ kler says of the German senior league .
most senior citizens sing in the choir and share the joy of music with like @-@ minded people , describing H@@ ac@@ kler .
through regular co@@ hab@@ itation , sen@@ iors can soci@@ alize and maintain social contacts .
because often social and family structures dissolve in old age , a choir is then an ideal opportunity to spend time with other people .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this experience has also made Ur@@ sel Ki@@ pp in her choir : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to pron@@ ounce and organise , to be able to rely on the others and to learn from each other - a choir is a very special form of being together . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
singing can be exhau@@ sting in a positive sense , H@@ ac@@ kler says .
sen@@ iors achieve deep and controlled breathing .
those who regularly demand their lungs are not so fast from the d@@ olls in everyday life .
even when it comes to receiving the sound of the voice at the age , singing is an optimal hobby .
on older people , singing often has a very special effect , says Ursul@@ a L@@ enz from the Federal Working Group of the Sen@@ iors &quot; organisations .
in the older generation , joint singing had a much higher priority , it belonged to everyday life , both at school and in leisure time , she explains .
L@@ enz often ob@@ serves that singing or listening to songs ar@@ ouses a lot of memories in older people , often associated with positive feelings of their youth .
through lyrics and especially melodies , people who are self @-@ reli@@ ant are falling down on long @-@ lying events .
when singing , a special performance is required for the head , L@@ enz explains .
to concentrate on one &apos;s own voice and rhythm and adapt to the other singers - this is a great cognitive challenge .
especially older people who live alone practice not only to concentrate on themselves .
another positive aspect is the recognition you experience through singing in the choir , says H@@ ac@@ kler .
an enthusiastic audience is a great praise .
the self @-@ esteem is also growing through singing in the choir .
to show yourself : if I practise for a long time , I will be better and a@@ verse beyond myself - this experience strengthens .
good reasons to start singing are enough .
whoever wants to try a new hobby should not hesitate - even if he thinks he has little talent , L@@ enz advises .
you don &apos;t sing alone - with 50 singing people , who hears when a sound goes wrong ?
looking for the right offer , sen@@ iors have different options , says H@@ ac@@ kler .
if someone sings from the circle of acquain@@ tances in a senior choir , one can simply join .
many cities also offer views of the choirs in the area .
those who want to sing in a church choir can turn directly to the church or the church leader .
many of the senior citizens can also be found via the Internet .
those who do not have access to the Internet can ask the family , friends or neighbours to help with the internet research .
those who feel like singing should definitely join a choir , H@@ ac@@ kler recommends .
singing does the soul well and has something liber@@ ating - this applies to any age .
cats react more sensitive than tom@@ cats to scre@@ ams of young animals
bi@@ ologists have studied in Hanover what effect the fen of k@@ itt@@ ens has on adult animals .
to their surprise , the mi@@ str@@ ust also didn &apos;t let the males cold - however they beha@@ ved always the same in contrast to the females .
female cats can recognize the degree of reg@@ ression of cat &apos;s babies at the mi@@ sting of the little ones .
they respond by ten percent faster to sounds of k@@ itt@@ ens , which are in great need , as scientists found out of the Veter@@ inary College and the Hannover Medical School ( M@@ H@@ H ) .
tom@@ cats also react to the calls of k@@ itt@@ ens - however always the same .
&quot; obviously , the acousti@@ cal differences between the mi@@ str@@ ust of less and strongly excited young animals for the males are either not percep@@ tible or not of importance , &quot; the bi@@ ologist Wi@@ eb@@ ke Kon@@ er@@ ding said of the M@@ H@@ H .
she is the first author of the study published on this Friday in the journal &quot; BM@@ C Evol@@ ution@@ ary Bi@@ ology . &quot;
in a previous study , the research team had already found out that the duration and pitch of the k@@ itt@@ ens &apos; cries differs with the ur@@ gency of their need@@ iness .
a total of nine adult males and eight female k@@ itt@@ ens were observed from the animal hus@@ band@@ ry of the M@@ H@@ H .
they were played for a first call of babies who were taken out of the litter box for three minutes and separated from mother and si@@ bl@@ ings .
on the other hand , they were confronted with scre@@ aming of more excited k@@ itt@@ ens , who were additionally lifted up .
despite the small sample , the researchers consider their results to be meaningful .
&quot; all females , even those who did not have their own offspring , re@@ acted to the scre@@ aming , &quot; Kon@@ er@@ ding said .
they turned out faster to the loudspeaker , when this calls of the very excited k@@ itt@@ ens played out .
this ability may be inn@@ ate or develop with the sexually mature .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a surprise was that the males have re@@ acted at all , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the bi@@ ologist . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the past , scientists have already studied the reactions of women and men on baby no@@ ises several times in humans .
some studies also showed that women were more sensitive to infants , regardless of whether they were pregnant or not , bi@@ ologist reported in Marina Sche@@ um@@ ann .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Po@@ dol@@ sky acc@@ esses &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gala &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after Super@@ cup &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Hak@@ an Sü@@ me@@ yer is a football legend in Turkey .
an arrest warrant has been issued against the former football star Hak@@ an Sü@@ me@@ r in Turkey .
he is accused of being a member of a terrorist group .
for the first time after the coup attempt , an important football match takes place again in Turkey .
before the du@@ el of the arch@@ rival between Bes@@ ik@@ tas Istanbul and Lukas Po@@ dol@@ sky &apos;s Gal@@ at@@ as@@ ar@@ ay Istanbul around the Super@@ cup in Kon@@ ya , the official line is clear : &quot; business as usual &quot; is announced .
already in the case of the suspension of the state of emergency after the crash test in July , the government , the daily routine of normal citizens , was not affected .
this does not apply to those suspected of belonging to the Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len movement , which is responsible for the coup attempt .
even before football does not stop .
the prosec@@ utor issued an arrest warrant against the former strong @-@ president Hak@@ an Sü@@ me@@ yer .
according to this , the South America living in America is accused of being a member of a terrorist group .
Sü@@ me@@ yer is said to be followers of the pre@@ acher Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len , who is responsible for the coup attempt by President Rec@@ ep Tay@@ y@@ ip Erdo@@ gan .
in fact , the state of emergency decre@@ ed for 90 days is still valid until October , but in fact it does not have any effect on the lives of most Turks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the ni@@ gh@@ tly &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; democracy guards &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in public squares throughout the country has declared Erdoğan &apos;s end on Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the sport is - like the whole country - divided into supporters and opponents Erdo@@ gan .
especially fans of the Labor Camp Bes@@ ik@@ tas are traditionally not among the friends of the President .
what unites the Turks , however , in the face of dramatic experience in history , is the strict rejection of military put@@ ties .
even the fans agree - no matter if their heart beats for Gal@@ at@@ as@@ ar@@ ay or Bes@@ ik@@ tas .
at Pok@@ al@@ si@@ eger &quot; Gala , &quot; it will come to Lukas Po@@ dol@@ ski again .
with 17 fo@@ ols and nine templates in all competitions , the 31 @-@ year @-@ old finished his first season as a top scor@@ er of his club .
in the final match against F@@ ener@@ b@@ ah@@ ce he achieved the 1 : 0 victory .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the newspaper &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; FA@@ NA@@ TI@@ K &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; che@@ ered him : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he was the best in the square . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he finished the season in an excellent way and secured the tro@@ phy for his team .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thanks &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pol@@ di &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the dis@@ ap@@ pointing season for the record master found a conci@@ li@@ atory conclusion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the pre @-@ round @-@ K.@@ o in the Champions League , the &quot; lions &quot; also leave early in the Europa League .
in the Sü@@ per Li@@ g it was enough to rank six .
the season was not good .
the cup was the only way to win something .
&quot; we managed this and that is the most important thing , &quot; said Po@@ dol@@ ski .
for Master Bes@@ ik@@ tas , the game year went better .
above all thanks to Mario Gom@@ ez , who with 26 season tre@@ ads as Sü@@ per @-@ Li@@ g @-@ Tor@@ cher @-@ King laid the basis for the 14th title .
this is also the reason that the fans continue to hope for the return of the 31 @-@ year @-@ old .
in doing so , the Gom@@ ez borrow@@ ed from the AC Florence under contract and announced to Bes@@ ik@@ tas only after the coup attempt to not return because of the political situation in the country after its European holiday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if Mario wants to come to us , he just has to say it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; quoted the specialist magazine &quot; Ki@@ cker &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Fi@@ kre@@ t Or@@ man . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the Stür@@ mer would have to be willing to ren@@ ounce about a third of his annual salary estimated at 7.5 million Euro , Or@@ man stated clearly : &quot; we cannot pay its salary in Florence . &quot;
despite dop@@ ing : these athletes have med@@ als chances at Olympic Games in Rio
the 34 @-@ year @-@ old J@@ ustin Gat@@ lin was locked twice as a result of dop@@ ing ( 2001 and 2006 ) .
Rio de Janeiro - W@@ hist@@ le@@ blo@@ wer@@ in Julia Step@@ an@@ ova must not start in Rio .
other le@@ aded athle@@ tics sinners can only laugh at it - they fight in Rio to med@@ als .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; dop@@ ing determines the head@@ lines of the Olympic Games in Rio . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Russian swi@@ mmer , Juli@@ ja Je@@ fi@@ m@@ owa , who had su@@ ed her start right shortly before the play after a dop@@ ing lock , was pi@@ ped out with mer@@ cil@@ essly at her start ( 100 meters of breast ) .
it was a bizarre scene : with a set smile she was still in the hall and provoked her performance .
as a celeb@@ r@@ ity that she won &apos;t get gold , the audience broke out into a ju@@ ly storm .
but there are numerous other sports@@ men going to the start despite the dop@@ ing past at the Rio Olympics .
here is an overview :
J@@ ustin Gat@@ lin ( 100 , 200 , 4x@@ 100 @-@ m @-@ Staff@@ el / USA ) : the 34 @-@ year @-@ old is one of the most controversial figures in athle@@ tics .
he has been locked twice as a result of dop@@ ing ( 2001 and 2006 to 2010 ) .
since its spell the Olympic champion of 2004 and ex @-@ world champion has been running even faster than before , it is the number one in the world over 100 m in 9.@@ 80 seconds and is regarded as the greatest chall@@ enger of U@@ sa@@ in Bol@@ t .
Shel@@ ly @-@ An@@ n F@@ ras@@ er @-@ Pr@@ yce ( 100 , 4x@@ 100 @-@ m @-@ eas@@ el / Jamaica ) : the two @-@ time Olympic champion and seven @-@ time world champion had to shut off a six @-@ month lock in 2010 after it was detected by Ox@@ y@@ co@@ don .
she had severe tooth@@ ache after surgery , the 29 @-@ year @-@ old defended herself .
Sandra Per@@ kovic ( Dis@@ cus / Croatia ) : in 2011 the Olympic champion of 2012 , world champion in 2013 and European Championship , was positively tested for the banned stimul@@ ant agent meth@@ yl@@ hex@@ an@@ amin from 2010 to 2016 .
Per@@ kovic denied the inqu@@ isi@@ tive intake and was closed for six months .
the four wi@@ dest th@@ rows this year go to the account of the big gold @-@ favor@@ i@@ tin .
La@@ Sha@@ wn Mer@@ ritt ( 200 , 400 , 4x@@ 400 @-@ m @-@ Staff@@ el / USA ) : the Beijing Olympic Champion and twice World Champion over 400 m , was positive tested in 2010 and was closed for 21 months .
a remedy for penis enlargement was responsible , mar@@ ching mar@@ row .
this year , the 30 @-@ year @-@ old is the fastest man in the world over 200 and 400 m .
Ivan T@@ ich@@ on ( hammer throw , Belarus ) : hardly an ath@@ lete has recognized so many med@@ als afterwards .
thus , T@@ ich@@ on lost its World Cup title in 2005 nine years later after testosterone @-@ dop@@ ing was established .
the 40 @-@ year @-@ old also had to hand out Olympia @-@ silver 2004 because of ster@@ oid dop@@ ing and the EM @-@ title in 2006 because of testosterone abuse .
he reg@@ ained the Bronze medal of the 2008 Olympic Games due to a verdict of the International Sports Court ( CA@@ S ) .
at 8@@ 0.@@ 04 m he is ranked second in the world rank@@ ings .
Li@@ u Hong ( 20 km walk , China ) : the world record holder and gold favourite was first tested in May , but still allowed to start in Rio .
at the 29 @-@ year @-@ old world championships , clu@@ es were found on the ing@@ es@@ tion of a banned food supplement , the lock of the World Anti @-@ D@@ oping agency WA@@ DA fell mil@@ dly and ran off on July 13th .
bomb terror in Thailand - Austrian woman injured - Sever@@ al dead
the Austrian Embassy in Thailand was in contact with the woman , said the spokes@@ man of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs , Thomas Schn@@ ö@@ ll , Friday morning .
she had suffered cuts and had been treated in hospital , but I already had to leave it again .
she planned her home trip at the beginning of September .
whether the further explo@@ sions on the island of Ph@@ u@@ ket as well as in the southern cities of Sur@@ at Th@@ ani , Ph@@ ang N@@ ga , Tran@@ g and Ch@@ umph@@ on are also affected by Austrian citizens , is still unclear .
in this regard , the Ministry of Foreign Affairs is in constant contact with local authorities , &quot; says Schn@@ ö@@ ll .
in the approximately 200 kilometres south of Bangkok &apos;s capital Bangkok , Hu@@ a H@@ in was initially explo@@ ding two bombs on Thursday evening .
according to the police , a Thai woman was killed and about 20 people were injured , including the Austrian , three Germans , three Dutch and three Itali@@ ans .
Friday morning two explo@@ sives went up again , and another man was killed according to the authorities .
also from Ph@@ u@@ ket a bomb explosion was reported in the morning .
during the det@@ onation in the vicinity of the popular seaside resort Pat@@ ong , a taxi driver was injured according to police instructions .
in Sur@@ at Th@@ ani on the south @-@ eastern coast of the country another bomb explo@@ ded , killing an urban workers .
according to the authorities , the explosive set had gone into the air in a bou@@ quet of flowers in front of the Re@@ vier of the Co@@ ast@@ al Police .
after all det@@ on@@ ations in Ph@@ ang N@@ ga and Tran@@ g on the south @-@ west coast as well as in Ch@@ umph@@ on on the south @-@ east coast demanded several injured .
there was a connection with the explo@@ sions in Hu@@ a H@@ in .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the bom@@ b@@ als carry the same signature , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said army general Dan@@ ai K@@ rit@@ meth@@ av@@ ee Friday morning before journalists . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we assume that it is a coordinated attack . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is too early to express itself on possible motives - but it is probably a matter of the actions of Muslim rebels .
Thai media also wanted to see a pattern typical of the bom@@ b@@ ate attacks of Muslim separ@@ ati@@ sts in the south of the country .
the Thai police , on the other hand , declared that the attacks were not in connection with the Islam@@ ist rebellion or with international terrorism .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is only local sab@@ otage which is limited to limited territories and provinces , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a spokes@@ man in Bangkok . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
rather , it is assumed that the bombs were placed by opponents of the ruling military j@@ un@@ ta .
in recent days , the authorities would have kept secret evidence of upcoming attacks in the south of the country - however , they were not informed about the exact time and places .
it is still unclear which group is behind the attacks .
the police instructed their officials throughout the country to increase security around important government buildings and airports , train stations , tourist attractions , restaurants and entertainment districts .
in Thailand , there are always smaller bomb attacks , but most of them are not directed against tourists .
in Hu@@ a H@@ in is a palace used for years by Tha@@ il@@ ands King B@@ hum@@ i@@ bol Ad@@ ul@@ y@@ ade@@ j .
after the well @-@ hear@@ ted bomb explo@@ sions , the Austrian Ministry of Foreign Affairs is recommen@@ ding its homepage to follow the instructions of the Thai security authorities .
high security risk ( security level 3 ) was applicable to the provinces of Nar@@ ath@@ i@@ w@@ at , Y@@ ala , P@@ att@@ ani and Son@@ gh@@ kl@@ a and Pre@@ ah V@@ ih@@ ear and surroundings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after disputes between security forces and Muslim populations , the necessary trips to these provinces are not recommended . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
increased security risk ( security level 2 ) was applicable to the rest of the country .
the attacks on Thursday and Friday were held a few days after a controversial referendum on a constitution dra@@ fted by the military j@@ un@@ ta .
this gives the military a great influence over the coming years .
Jun@@ ta chief and prime minister Pra@@ y@@ ut Ch@@ an @-@ o @-@ cha said that the bombs were an attempt to create chaos while the country moves towards stability , improvement of economic situation and tourism .
the military un@@ ta , who had seized power in 2014 after a period of bloody un@@ rest , will benefit himself from having restored the kingdom to stability and order .
however , it has not been possible for the military to get a grip on the insur@@ gency of Muslim rebels for years in the extreme south of the country .
more than 6@@ 500 people have already been killed in the conflict .
almost a year ago , 20 people were killed in Bangkok at a stop at a popular Hind@@ u shr@@ ine - most of them foreign tourists .
it was the bloo@@ dies@@ t attack of the country &apos;s younger history .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the right &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; identical movement &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is targeted at the Federal Office for Constitutional Protection . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after several state offices , the Constitutional Prot@@ ectors in the Con@@ federation have also set up the group under observation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we see the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; identity movement &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for aspir@@ ations against the liberal democratic constitution , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Constitutional Court Hans @-@ Georg Ma@@ aß / Deutsche Presse @-@ Agentur in Berlin . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
thus immigrants from Islamic faith or from the Middle East are de@@ fam@@ ed in extrem@@ ist ways .
that is why we now observe the movement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; identical movement &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is a group@@ ing with French roots , which has been active in Germany since 2012 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it turns against &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mul@@ tik@@ ul@@ ti @-@ W@@ ahn , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; un@@ controlled mass immigration &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; loss of one &apos;s identity by &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
constitutional Prot@@ ectors in nine federal states - Bremen , Bavaria , Hessen , Berlin , Baden @-@ Württemberg , NRW , Lower Saxony , Saxony and Thur@@ in@@ gia - are already observing the &quot; identi@@ ties . &quot;
Ma@@ ate said that his authority was closely aligned with the local authorities in the decision .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; groups like the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; identical movement &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; try to pick up their target group where it stands , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Constitutional Court . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in general , extre@@ mi@@ sts try to address them with a more you@@ thful language , often with p@@ opp@@ y music .
the fac@@ ul@@ ties of Islam@@ ists as well as right @-@ wing extre@@ mi@@ sts .
this is not an adverti@@ sed advertisement for one &apos;s own thing .
propaganda is meant to appeal to people emotion@@ ally .
young people are particularly vulnerable .
this is dangerous .
last but not least , there have been reports on the contacts of the &quot; Identi@@ ties &quot; to the Af@@ D politicians from several states .
Ma@@ ate said he did not have any findings .
for the constitutional protection , possible contacts of this kind are only relevant at a certain point .
it depends on whether the particular party - in this case - the Af@@ D - by certain individuals who are extrem@@ ist , will change their direction and become extrem@@ ist .
the decisive factor is whether such people have a controlling influence on the party .
this is not recognizable .
with a view of the marked increase in illegal off@@ ences and attacks on asylum seekers and refugee camps , Ma@@ ate said he would not speak of new righ@@ tist terrorism in this context .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but we have found in recent years that there can be legal @-@ terrorism structures . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there was the group &apos; Old School Society &apos; or the Free @-@ Free Group .
it may well be that other right @-@ wing terrorist groups or small groups are planning to plan attacks against asylum seekers , refugees or attacks from other right @-@ wing extrem@@ ist motives .
however , a Germany @-@ wide or Europe @-@ wide control of right @-@ wing terrorism is not recognizable .
the previous groups were formed on the regional level or in social networks .
ma@@ d@@ men expressed concern that many of the attacks went to the account of people who had previously not appeared in the right scene .
this is the wor@@ rying thing .
many of the suspect &apos;s suspi@@ ci@@ ons of attacks on asylum accommodations were previously not known as criminals , politically motivated off@@ ences or supporters of the right scene .
&quot; many people have committed crimes that previously had nothing to do with right @-@ wing extre@@ mi@@ sts , which perhaps were politically in@@ different or elected for example CD@@ U , SPD or left , which , however , have radic@@ alised themselves through far @-@ wing extrem@@ ist mo@@ ods . &quot;
Rio 2016 : RO@@ BE@@ L Ki@@ ros Hab@@ te Bec@@ omes Inter@@ ne@@ th@@ ite
the Olympic Games or World Records don &apos;t always determine the head@@ lines of the Olympic Games .
this shows the courageous appearance of Ro@@ bel Ki@@ ros Hab@@ te at the summer games in Rio de Janeiro .
at the Aqu@@ atics Center , the slightly overweight s@@ wimm@@ ers from Ethiopia slowly sw@@ am so slow that he was no longer seen in the TV pictures .
it simply disappeared - no matter how far the cut@@ out was selected .
in social networks , Hab@@ te was subsequently promoted to viral inter@@ ne@@ th@@ ite .
in fact , the 24 @-@ year @-@ old finished with a 48 @-@ second set@@ back and finished the 59@@ th place of 59 star@@ ters .
but it was rather his not just athle@@ tic figure that attracted the attention of the international media .
why does the 24 @-@ year @-@ old take part in the Olympics ?
the Ethiop@@ ian got a special start@@ right from the international swimming association .
this is distributed to make swimming in under@@ represented countries better known .
since most sports@@ men run in Ethiopia , Hab@@ te wanted to do something else .
preparation is everything : RO@@ BE@@ L Ki@@ ros Hab@@ te is ready for the big race .
quickly the first nick@@ names made the round .
some media referred to him as &quot; Ro@@ bel of the W@@ al . &quot;
the English tab@@ loid &quot; The Sun &quot; made fun of him with &quot; D@@ ad B@@ od . &quot;
his time , he only struck with a minute and almost five seconds over the 100 m Fre@@ estyle , played no role here .
compar@@ isons with &quot; Eric the E@@ el &quot; were also drawn .
during the 2000 Olympic Games in Sydney , the run of Eric M@@ ous@@ sam@@ ban@@ i took care of media attention .
the appearance of the s@@ wimm@@ ers from Equ@@ at@@ orial Guinea was an unforgettable experience , when he had to race alone on his own in a for@@ en@@ ema of more than 100 metres .
at that time M@@ ous@@ sam@@ ban@@ i was fired at that time .
the 22 @-@ year @-@ old learned to swim just eight months before the Olympics and had never taken such a long distance before the competition .

Ger@@ ets@@ ried - The owner of a shop in the New Place has been char@@ ted .
according to the police , the 67 @-@ year @-@ old Ger@@ ets@@ rie@@ der@@ man had left their business on Monday at 5.@@ 30 p.m. and forgot to close a window on the ground floor .
when they returned the next morning at 8.@@ 15 , the cas@@ hier had disappeared about 250 euros .
traces of the perpetr@@ ator could not be found .
video surveillance is also not available .
Tr@@ ump does not see the im@@ pending electoral defeat so narrow
the Republi@@ can presidential candidate Donald Tr@@ ump speaks at an election campaign in Florida .
if there is nothing to do with the election of the US president , Donald Tr@@ ump has already an alternative video .
he then travels to the holiday .
if Donald Tr@@ ump loses the US presidential election in November , it doesn &apos;t matter : &quot; in the end , it will either flip , or I have a very , very nice , long vacation , &quot; said the candidate of the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans in a telephone interview with the US TV transmitter CN@@ BC .
if it is not enough for him at the end for reasons of political correctness , that is ok , said Tr@@ ump .
so he called US President Barack Obama and the Democrats of the Democrats , H@@ illary Clinton , as the founder of the terrorist militia Islamic State ( IS ) .
within his party , more and more resistance was formed .
mail enters the trade with electric v@@ ans
an electric delivery vehicle of the Deutsche Post in action .
the interest of other firms in the vehicle is apparently large .
the post plans to sell your electric vehicle Stre@@ et@@ Sco@@ oter .
the Group plans to start trading with the transpor@@ ter shortly .
the post office wants to offer its electric vehicles on the free market as of next year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to go on sale to third parties , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a post @-@ speaker on Friday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for months , the company has been testing whether they are to deliver their self @-@ developed Stre@@ et@@ Sco@@ oter , with which letters and par@@ c@@ els are to be sold to other farms .
post @-@ Chairman Jürgen Ger@@ der had said , there are always questioning , about craftsmen .
according to the news magazine &quot; Der Spiegel , &quot; the Bon@@ ner Group will shortly enter the mass production of the vehicles .
in the post @-@ company manufacturing plant , the company plans to build up to 10,000 cars per year and shift .
Ger@@ ald announced that the Group would like to significantly increase its fleet of electric cars and make a complete change@@ over to the environmentally friendly vehicles in the long term .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will make a very , very robust step towards 2020 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he said at the end of July . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I can imagine that we change the entire fleet .
the Stre@@ et@@ Sco@@ oter has been active on Germany &apos;s roads since 2014 .
GF@@ K leadership succ@@ eeds in dis@@ ap@@ pointing business figures
the consumer research company Gf@@ K exchanges its boss Matthias Hart@@ mann .
the res@@ ign@@ ations suddenly came suddenly - but not quite surprising .
the difficult situation of the market research company Gf@@ K showed that the chair of CEO Matthias Hart@@ mann becomes even more uncertain , the longer the success promised by him .
turbul@@ ence at the head of the Nuremberg market research company Gf@@ K : after renewed dis@@ ap@@ pointing business figures and the res@@ ignation of corporate management , the global number five in the industry is facing a new beginning .
G@@ FR@@ P Managing Director wants to leave the company at the end of the year .
the chairman of the Gf@@ K supervisory board Ar@@ no Mahl@@ ert is already leaving the Supervisory Board with effect on September 12 .
the management board member , Gerhard Haus@@ ru@@ ck@@ inger , already took over the management board as of September 1 , divided the company .
he shall officially assume the function of a &quot; spokes@@ man &quot; until a successor for Hart@@ mann was found .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the company called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; different views &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the long @-@ term business policy orientation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a company spokes@@ man on Friday did not want to mention details .
those who will be conducting the market research company in future will be unclear at this time .
in An@@ le@@ ger@@ Real@@ ms it was said on Friday , in the event of the shareholders the disappointment about the continued success of the restructuring carried out years ago would have been great .
Mr. Hart@@ mann has been on the Gf@@ K @-@ summit since 2011 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , the fruits of restructuring must not be seen after 5 years &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in view of the last bad Gf@@ K business figures , every shareholder is at some point uncertain .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if that would be the case with BMW , that would also make the qu@@ and@@ ts so , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to set@@ backs in the preceding quarters , the company failed to stop its loss of power in the second quarter of 2016 .
at EUR 36@@ 1.2 million , sales were down 6.1 percent below the comparable prior @-@ year quarter .
in terms of the first half of the year , sales declined by 3.4 percent to EUR 7@@ 21.@@ 2 million .
in the second quarter , the lower value of the company was imp@@ acted in the face of its difficult economic situation .
the company value depreciation of EUR 139 million which was necessary in the Consumer Experience Business Unit generated a loss of 14@@ 8.2 million euros .
in the second quarter of 2015 , the Gf@@ K generated consolidated net income of 19.@@ 7 million .
accidents - Bus in Kr@@ um@@ m@@ fa@@ n in Gra@@ ben : eight wounded
eight people were injured in an accident involving 43 sen@@ iors as passengers on Thursday in Kr@@ um@@ m@@ aus@@ n ( district Aur@@ ich ) .
two of the in@@ mates suffered serious injuries , informed the police .
according to her information , the 66 @-@ year @-@ old driver of the coach of a travel company from Eisen@@ ach , according to her information , had to ev@@ ade a truck which was partly on the opposite side of the road .
the bus came to the right from the road and sli@@ d into a dit@@ ch , as a spokes@@ woman of the police Aur@@ ich / Witt@@ mund reported .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to the location of the bus , the people couldn &apos;t leave the bus independently , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the fire bri@@ g@@ ade liber@@ ated the occup@@ ants .
six ambul@@ ances and a ambul@@ ance car came to the scene of the accident at the state road 2 .
the injured travellers were brought back from a regular bus to the Kr@@ um@@ m@@ ê@@ ner district of P@@ ew@@ sum .
there they should wait for a replacement bus from the travel company .
the investig@@ ators asked the trucks and potential witnesses to report to the police .
the fees per cubic metre of waste water will be for the area of the sewage system Neu@@ dorf / Re@@ uth / Wel@@ sch@@ ahl 3,@@ 44 instead of 2.@@ 10 euros ; for Zul@@ ten@@ berg / Lin@@ den@@ berg / L@@ opp . 3.@@ 36 Euro ( previously 2,@@ 26 Euro ) and for Az@@ endorf 3,@@ 64 Euro ( previously 2,@@ 18 euros ) .
at the facility in Az@@ endorf , the waste water charge will be increased by the latest if appropriate improvement measures are necessary .
after a rough calculation , the waste water price in Az@@ endorf will then be 4.@@ 37 euros per cubic metre .
as mayor Bernd Stein@@ häuser ( CS@@ U ) reported , with the approval of the household through the office office Kul@@ mb@@ ach , it was established that under@@ cover for these sewage plants was running .
due to the legal basis , the market Kas@@ endorf is obliged to operate the plants in a cost @-@ covering manner .
as of 1 October 2016 , the citizens and the industrial and industrial companies from Wel@@ sch@@ ahl , Neu@@ dorf , Re@@ uth , Az@@ endorf , L@@ opp , Lin@@ den@@ berg and Zul@@ ten@@ berg will have to go deeper into the wal@@ let .
increases in fees are between 48 and 67 percent .
as Managing Director Herbert Schmidt displayed the body , a new calculation of fees for the wastewater facilities of the market community was necessary .
over the period from October 2016 to September 2020 , over@@ - and under@@ cover from the previous calculation period should also be equ@@ alled .
Schmidt explained the grave fee increases in all three wastewater facilities with relatively small facilities with a very low waste water attack , which is between 6@@ 800 and 1@@ 2000 cubic meters per year .
due to the low distribution basis , for example , expenses for necessary repairs would have a serious impact on several thousand euros .
in addition , the waste water volume in all three plants is slightly declining .
furthermore , in all three installations , renovation and repair expendi@@ tures in all three facilities were not least incurred in all three facilities due to their age .
the facility in Az@@ endorf is nearly 30 years old , the facilities for Wel@@ sh , Neu@@ dorf and Re@@ uth as well as Zul@@ ten@@ berg , Lin@@ den@@ berg and L@@ opp are almost 20 years old .
Schmidt indicated that the mechanical ventilation system had to be replaced on the basis of a damage in the Az@@ endorf sewage system .
after almost 20 years of operation the first sewage ponds had to be removed , the sewage slu@@ dge dispos@@ ed of and an additional ventilation possibility had to be installed in order to comply with the water @-@ legal requirements in the future .
Schmidt : &quot; these extraordinary expenses resulted in continued support and maintenance costs , which are to be taken into account in the new calculation period . &quot;
the same applies to electricity costs , which were clearly below the current level in the previous calculation in the years 2011 / 2012 .
stone houses made it clear that in the three plants , the expenses for operation and maintenance were &quot; fully penet@@ rated &quot; in the three plants . &quot;
Schmidt , the market community of large maintenance costs in the wastewater facilities in the past 20 years , has been spar@@ ed .
the situation for the aforementioned equipment will continue to remain prec@@ arious in view of stone houses , especially since the supply area of the Fri@@ es@@ enb@@ ach@@ tal wastewater association is not to be extended because it is a deficit system .
Bulgaria records inflation for the first time in 8 months
national statistics show that inflation in Bulgaria was 1 % on a monthly basis in July .
this is the highest value ( since June 2012 ) and the first one above zero since October last year , when positive 0.2 % were posted .
the annual average inflation of the last 12 months ( August 2015 - July 2016 ) compared to the previous 12 months ( August 2014 - July 2015 ) was measured according to the CP@@ I -@@ 0.8 % .
the consumer price index in July 2016 compared to June 2016 amounted to 10@@ 1.0 % , i.e. the monthly inflation was 1.0 % .
the inflation rate since the beginning of the year ( July 2016 compared to December 2015 ) was -@@ 0.2 % and the annual inflation in July 2016 compared to July 2015 was -@@ 0.2 % .
in July 2016 a price increase of the following groups of consumer goods was observed in comparison with the previous month : food and non @-@ alcoholic beverages ( 1,7 % ) ; transportation ( 1.8 % ) ; leisure and culture ( 6.3 % ) ; restaurants and hotels ( 1.2 % ) ; various goods and services ( 0.3 % ) .
prices fell by clothing and footwear ( 2.2 % ) ; furniture , household appliances and routine maintenance ( 0.5 % ) ; health ( 0,1 % ) .
the prices remained as in the previous month with alcoholic beverages and tobacco ; apartments , water , electricity , gas and other fuels ; communication ; as well as education unchanged .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; anim@@ e &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; effect as Asian car@@ ic@@ ature critic@@ ises &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Snap@@ chat says that this filter is anim@@ e @-@ inspired , but some ob@@ servers say that it is in@@ sensitive to races .
with its filtering tool , Snap@@ chat enables around 150 million daily users to change the reality and to play with identi@@ ties in such a way that already borders on the absurd .
you can transform yourself into a p@@ ine@@ apple , a dog or a figure that could be a painting from a Roy Licht@@ enstein .
the filters are imm@@ ac@@ ulate , self @-@ rotating tools that generate more than 30 million improved sel@@ fies per day .
all mis@@ steps get to the public .
in the past , snap@@ chat filters have been critici@@ zing critics in which they were accused of supporting the app black@@ face promoting or white skin as a beauty ideal .
when this week suggested a filter to some users that gave them s@@ lag eyes , false teeth and dark che@@ eks , some critics called a rac@@ ist car@@ ic@@ ature from Asi@@ ans - &quot; ja@@ un@@ dice . &quot;
they asked themselves whether these repeated controversi@@ es pointed to a greater problem that the company has with diversity .
the news and ou@@ trage were widespread on Wednesday , with reports by The Ver@@ ge and Mo@@ ther@@ board , a day after Snap@@ chat communicated that it would have turned off the feature .
the company offered an ap@@ ology : the filter was intended as a homage to anim@@ e characters and not as car@@ ic@@ ature of Asi@@ ans .
but out@@ si@@ ders who have experienced rac@@ ism reminded the filter of hur@@ t@@ ful c@@ lich@@ és .
others rejected the anim@@ e comparison .
in an email , Grace Spar@@ ap@@ ani wrote a Korean @-@ American art student whose twe@@ ets were widespread over the photos that the filter was &quot; hur@@ t@@ ful and mil@@ dly said . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she added that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is difficult to argue with the contrast of a very disgu@@ sting Asian car@@ ic@@ ature and filter effects . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it shows that the filter is not yel@@ low@@ ish , but that the yel@@ lowing of the yellow face was pulled into the cutting extrem@@ ity .
Snap@@ chat is not the only company that crosses this cultural pride .
American culture seems to be involved in an endless diversity of diversity and integration , from conference rooms to Hollywood and the devices that we all hold in hand .
and Snap@@ ch@@ ats large audience of young people - who are more different in terms of race than their older opponents - could be more likely to expect sensitivity .
if one of Snap@@ ch@@ ats filters creates a picture that is insul@@ ting for a user , &quot; it is much more difficult that such items remain un@@ noticed when it was the case , &quot; said the 25 @-@ year @-@ old K@@ atie Z@@ hu in an interview on Thursday .
on Thursday Z@@ hu , who works as a product manager and engineer for medium , decided to delete her Snap@@ chat account and asked others to do the same .
in an essay on medium and in a telephone interview , she said that she believes that mass @-@ related controversi@@ es reflect a lack of diversity in the settings practices at Snap@@ chat .
Z@@ hu critici@@ zed the large part white , only male leadership and ended her essay with a h@@ ash@@ tag : # Del@@ et@@ e@@ Snap@@ chat .
&quot; either she has no diverse representation of people with other skin colors in her workforce , so that they can make such decisions , &quot; said the Chinese @-@ American Z@@ hu , &quot; or they have people with other skin colors that work there , but are not in positions where they feel safe or comfortable to say about it . &quot;
others share their opinion , a complaint that Snap@@ chat has largely left un@@ answered .
the company does not publish numbers on the diversity of its workforce and points to its status as a private company .
on Thursday , snap@@ chat refused to discuss the cultural background of his collabor@@ ators , but according to a spokesperson , the company recently set up a HR officer focused on under@@ represented population groups and internal integration efforts .
Z@@ hu said that she will be closed to her Snap@@ chat account and added , &quot; I wonder if they need more users like us to say that this is not O.@@ K. . &quot;
military leadership distorted IS@@ IS intelligence gathering information , re@@ jects the Committee of the Congress
military personnel of the United States Central Command changed intelligence information to draw a more optim@@ istic picture of the war against the so @-@ called Islamic State in Iraq and Syria , as it had allowed the actual conditions on the ground , reported an inquiry committee of the Congress in a report on Thursday .
the preliminary report , created by a Task Force of the Republi@@ can members of the Army Committ@@ ees , Secret Service Committ@@ ees , and the Ar@@ ms @-@ budget compromise , reports of great dis@@ content under Central Command secret service analysts who reported how superi@@ ors changed their assessments on American efforts in the fight against the Islamic State .
the Central Command , short C@@ en@@ com , is the military headquarters in T@@ amp@@ a , Florida , which controls the American military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia .
&quot; intelligence @-@ related information , typically inspired by high @-@ level Cent@@ Com com@@ man@@ ders , regularly reported a positive picture of US efforts against terrorism when it allowed the actual conditions on the ground and were consistently positive as analyses of other intelligence services , &quot; a newspaper article quoted the report .
&quot; what happened at Cent@@ Com is unacceptable - our soldiers suffer if poor analysis presents our political leaders , &quot; K@@ en Cal@@ vert , a republi@@ can member of the House of Repres@@ ent@@ atives , established .
the leadership mistakes in the Cent@@ com range up to the top of the organization .
the ten @-@ page report presents detailed problems in the years 2014 and 2015 in the descriptions and analyses of American efforts in the training of the Iraqi forces .
although there is no direct evidence that government peaks have given instructions under Obama to change the reports , it shows how analysts faced pressure from their superi@@ ors to draw a more optim@@ istic picture of the threat of the Islamic State , also known as IS@@ IS or IS@@ IL .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; during the first half of 2015 , many Central Command press releases , statements and statements prior to Congress were much more positive than the facts &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for example , a Cent@@ Com member announced publicly that a military re@@ conquest of Mos@@ sul@@ s could already begin in April or May 2015 .
Mos@@ ul , the second largest city in Iraq , remains under the control of the Islamic State .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after months of investigation , so much is clear . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mike Pom@@ pe@@ o , Republi@@ can Con@@ gres@@ s@@ man from K@@ ans@@ as , in a statement . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
from the middle of 2014 to the middle of 2015 , the leaders of the Central Command changed the intelligence reports to down@@ play the danger of IS@@ IS in Iraq .
the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans launched the Task Force in life after they were admitted that analysts were worried about the manipulation of reports to the Islamic State .
the report published on Thursday will be completed by more detailed information while investigating .
in addition , further investigations of the Cent@@ com reports are underway by the Secretary General of the Ministry of Defense .
democratic members of the Intelligence Committee published their own findings on Thursday , which coinci@@ ded with some of the conclusions of the Republi@@ can Task Force .
&quot; in the years 2014 and 2015 , the Cent@@ Com created an over@@ ly restricted process for the creation of intelligence services for IS@@ IL and Iraqi security services , &quot; the highest @-@ ranking dem@@ ok@@ rat in the committee , member of the House of Repres@@ ent@@ atives Adam B. Schiff , announced in an opinion .
this process , as Mr. Schiff , &quot; delayed the publication of intelligence reports , &quot; damaged mor@@ als among analysts and &quot; over@@ ly little room for dis@@ s@@ enting opinions . &quot;
but Mr. Shi@@ p and the Democrats gave no evidence of the White House interven@@ ing at the Cent@@ Com analysts regarding a &quot; definite political opinion . &quot;
preliminary results of the investigations of the congress were published on Tuesday by &quot; The Daily Be@@ ast . &quot;
last August , the New York Times reported an investigation by the Pentagon &apos;s General In@@ spec@@ tor , which was in@@ scri@@ bed on Cent@@ com analysts .
according to C@@ m@@ dr@@ . Patrick Ev@@ ans , a Pentagon spokes@@ man , in a statement that the Ministry of Defense would not comment on the congress , while the investigation of the General In@@ spec@@ tor is still underway .
but he also stated that &quot; experts sometimes have diver@@ gent opinions about the interpretation of complex data , and that the intelligence agencies and the Ministry of Defense welcome a controversial discussion of these important issues of national defence . &quot;
the investigation has triggered re@@ perc@@ ussions on the question of a successful air campaign under US leadership in Iraq and Syria ( a claim that is now being made by a growing number of members of the Ministry of Defense ) .
however , last year &apos;s accus@@ ations raised the question of how President Obama can rely on the Central Command for honest assessment of military operations in Iraq , Afghanistan , Libya and other crisis regions .
the criticism of the secret information about the Islamic State is reminiscent of disputes from more than ten years ago , when a Cent@@ Com analy@@ st , Greg@@ ory Hoo@@ ker , wrote a document about how the then government under George W. Bush fores@@ aw only a small occupation force in Iraq and had little time to think about the consequences of the 2003 invasion .
Mr. Hoo@@ ker also played a key role in the revol@@ t against current reporting on the Islamic State .
last year , the team headed by Mr. Hoo@@ ker states that contrary to the government &apos;s statements , air strikes against the refin@@ eries held by the Islamic State would have no significant effect on the financial situation of the terrorist group , as these provisional refin@@ eries would have put into operation to sell oil on the black market .
this recognition , however , was not published , the Times reported in September .
Cent@@ re@@ s dam@@ al@@ iger Commander , Gen@@ . Lloyd J. Austin III , was critic@@ ised by members of the legislature because of his over@@ ly positive assessment of the war situation during a hearing before the Senate .
general Austin retired in April and was replaced by Gen@@ . Joseph L. V@@ otel .
the US is winning fourth match in the field ho@@ ckey of women , a show@@ down with the UK is ahead
one day after shooting three gates during a 6 @-@ 1 victory over Japan , K@@ atie B@@ am also made the first two doors for the American field ho@@ ckey team of women in a match on Thursday against India that the Americans won 3 @-@ 0 .
five goals in two games should actually represent a memorable achievement , but B@@ am ( 27 ) said that she could not remember what has ever done .
&quot; I have no idea . &quot; she said .
I am not one of the people who keep their goals in memory .
but she knows that : the Americans are at 4 @-@ 0 in the Olympic competition and are also in their group with the Brit@@ ons in the first place that remains unbe@@ aten after their 2 @-@ 0 victory against Japan .
Britain and the United States will meet on Saturday in the last game of the first round .
both teams have already qualified for the quarter @-@ fin@@ als , the game will decide which of the two teams will win the first and second place within their group of six teams .
the first placed one will move the strong Dutch slightly longer out of the way that will lead the other group .
as always the game may go out on Saturday , the Americans have triggered a surprising vor@@ tex through their success story , four years after they landed at the last London Games in the last of 12 places .
BA@@ M was part of this team .
she grew up in Blue Bell , Pennsylvania , and for the first time at three years had a ho@@ ckey club in hands ( her two older sisters played sports at Dre@@ xel University ) , at 16 years she became a national player of the USA , the youngest in the history of the team .
she missed the 2008 Olympics as she could not qualify for the Ka@@ der .
then came the year 2012 , in which everything went wrong for her and her team .
in the following year Cra@@ ig Par@@ n@@ ham , an Engl@@ ish@@ man , coach of the National Team , began to turn things into a better way .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a change of culture , a mental change and a physical change , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said B@@ am . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we did not have the work@@ load in London that we now have .
we have been able to carry out the ru@@ dder completely .
on Thursday evening , B@@ am opened the door@@ way in the first half of the game with a back hand from the close range .
India had gone into the game without victory , but the team turned out surprisingly tough and held the score from 1 @-@ 0 to the third quarter until B@@ am took the game into her hands .
she performed a spr@@ int with the flat ball over the left flan@@ k , then moved into the middle and pulled the ball into the gate to give the American female a 2 @-@ 0 guide .
Mel@@ issa Gon@@ z@@ al@@ ez made the final gate in the middle of the last quarter .
the Sh@@ ut@@ out was the first of the whole tournament for the door@@ keeper of the USA , Jack@@ ie Brig@@ gs , who had previously had to book one gate in each of the previous games .
it has a run .
just like B@@ am .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are in a good position , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Par@@ n@@ ham , but how good will depend on the outcome of the next game on Saturday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the heart of the R@@ age of the Olympic Games , the Zen of tramp@@ ol@@ ines
wherever you are , as late as it is , the Olympics are .
in Rio de Janeiro , the events in Rio de Janeiro are constantly growing and inevitable , a r@@ att@@ ling relay race between competition and aspir@@ ation .
it is as if the Olympic torch itself is a burning staff that is handed down from the cross@@ bow to the s@@ wimm@@ ers to the gymn@@ as@@ tics for tri@@ athletes .
you can &apos;t turn on TV , read a newspaper or listen to your neighbor &apos;s conversation in the coffee shop without hearing about Sim@@ one Bil@@ es , K@@ atie Le@@ deck@@ y or the fight between Michael P@@ helps and C@@ had le C@@ los .
and then there is Lo@@ gan Do@@ ol@@ ey .
Do@@ ol@@ ey , who for the first time at the Olympic Games and a s@@ warm of women with dimples , could have been among these well @-@ known names that were sent to Prime Time , built up by sponsors and well @-@ being TV advertising , if he were a s@@ wimm@@ ers , gymn@@ asts or even fen@@ c@@ ers .
but Do@@ ol@@ ey , 28 , from Lake Forest , California , is fighting gold in the Olympic trampoline .
the Olympic flame does not illumin@@ ate every event .
further from the centre , partly in the shade , are the sports that are not universally recognized : air gun shooting , arch@@ ery , bad@@ min@@ ton , Ta@@ ek@@ won@@ do .
we will always have the breast@@ stroke and may it rule for a long time .
but if I would like to make arguments for my particular dar@@ ling , then let me draw your attention to the discreet charm of the trampoline .
although the trampoline has been an Olympic event since 2000 , when it had its debut in Sydney , it was so spar@@ sely perceived over the past 16 years that many of them that I had inter@@ viewed didn &apos;t know that it was even an Olympic movement .
this could also be regional ignorance .
although the USA sent athletes to compete , it has never won a medal in jumping and until 2012 had an ath@@ lete who made it to the final round .
the Chinese and the Russians have a tendency to share prices for the men and the Chinese and the Can@@ adi@@ ans for women .
D@@ ong D@@ ong from China and Ro@@ sie Mac@@ L@@ enn@@ an from Canada will defend their gold medal from London this year .
jumping on the trampoline has a certain out@@ sider char@@ me , partly because it sounds more suitable for the un@@ enlightened ear for a c@@ lown school than for the Olympic Games .
at this point I should admit that I am not an expert , but only an experienced enthusi@@ ast .
it has humor@@ ous potential - the carto@@ on@@ ous trem@@ bling of his never @-@ ending grow@@ ling - but also the grace of gymn@@ as@@ tics and diving , the two sports that it essentially unites .
the word &quot; Tramp@@ oline &quot; comes from the Spanish El Tramp@@ oline , which means as much as &quot; spring@@ board . &quot;
emerging winners jump on a giant trampoline , shoot almost up to 30 feet in the air and need a number of falling movements ( turning , pi@@ ke and sal@@ tos ) before they land on their feet .
according to the official program of the Olympic programme , they are evaluated according to the design , degree of difficulty and &quot; flight time . &quot;
thirty @-@ two athletes from 17 countries , 16 men and 16 women , will compete against each other in Rio .
the most common Olympic v@@ ector is straight ahead .
med@@ alli@@ sts must continue in their quest for gold , faster , upward and above , sometimes up to the goal , sometimes back and forth , upwards and down@@ wards on the playground .
not only do they hunt the finish line or the output wall , but also a further hei@@ gh@@ tened destination in the television broadcasting : the world or the Olympic Games .
the goal @-@ oriented aspir@@ ation is no@@ bel , ad@@ mira@@ ble , even fan@@ atic - and it is enough to even stir a spect@@ ator into tears .
but it is also what I feel ti@@ ring even when watching these games .
the trampoline offers a breathing space .
the V@@ ector of the trampoline jum@@ per is above .
a forward movement is not the goal .
he or she boun@@ ces off , seemingly wei@@ ght@@ less like an a@@ stron@@ aut , goes up , then down , then effort@@ lessly back up .
here too there is a competition , of course not without difficulty , but during the exercise there is no hec@@ tic attack on the goal , not a wolf in the distance , only the dre@@ amy , elegant lifting of time and gravity .
it is as Zen as the competition can only be at the Olympic Games .
the qualifying and final hours of the women will take place on Friday afternoon , in streaming at 13.@@ 00 Eastern Time ; the men on Saturday , also at 13.@@ 00 .
N@@ BC will radi@@ ate the final rounds as part of an afternoon block on both days from 14.@@ 00 onwards .
in the midst of the Olympia man@@ ia they promise a quiet , nice moment , one that is likely to be over@@ looked in the general tum@@ ult .
if the increase in consciousness can only be achieved by the spru@@ e and the obj@@ ections of male athletes - as the male US @-@ Tur@@ ner suggested recently - according to The Wall Street Journal - then Mr. Do@@ ol@@ ey expects his new fan base .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a generation protests &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Ethiopia , Long an ally of the United States &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
violent protests in Ethiopia
demonstr@@ ators demanding political changes in Ethiopia met with the government &apos;s violent resistance .
witnesses testified that tens of prot@@ esters were killed during the cl@@ ashes with the police at shot changes .
is Ethiopia just going to collapse ?
over the past ten years , it has been one of the most stable countries in Africa , a solid ally of the West with a rapidly growing economy .
but in recent months protests against the government sh@@ ook the country and expanded into more and more areas .
last week thousands of people stor@@ med the streets and demanded fundamental political changes .
according to human rights organizations , the government &apos;s response was ru@@ th@@ less .
witnesses stated that polic@@ emen shot and killed dozens of un@@ armed demonstr@@ ators .
circulating videos circulating on the protests , presumably from the last or the beginning of this year , show how security people hit young people with sticks while they were forced to make a stand against a wall .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the head of the UN Human Rights authority now demands a thorough investigation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it has always been difficult to consoli@@ date this country and in the future it will become even more difficult , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ras@@ hid Ab@@ di , the leader of the Horn of Africa of the International Cris@@ is Group , a research group . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ethiopia is the most popul@@ ous country in Africa and its stability is estimated by the West .
American military and intelligence services work closely with the Ethiop@@ ians to fight terrorist attacks beyond the region , especially in Somalia . only a few countries in Africa , if at all , get so much western help .
Ethiopia &apos;s economy expanded at a remarkable pace .
its infrastructure has improved dramatically - there is a new commu@@ ter train in the capital Ad@@ dis A@@ be@@ ba .
the roads are usually quiet , safe and clean .
even though Ethiopia was anything but a model for democracy - human rights organisations have continuously led the repression by the government - the opposition in the country was cur@@ tail@@ ed , and dissi@@ dents were effectively sil@@ enced .
many were sent into exile or in prison , killed or driven into the expan@@ se of the desert .
but that could change .
&quot; if you press people and don &apos;t have any other options except to protest , it breaks out , &quot; said Se@@ you@@ m Tes@@ co , a lecturer in Central Ethiopia .
the entire youth protests .
a generation protests .
there are numerous complaints that cover everything from land use to stran@@ gl@@ ehold over power of the ruling coalition .
after a far @-@ reaching election last year , the ruling party and its allies got the last seat of the opposition and now control 100 percent of the Parliament .
at the same time , tensions continue along the border to Er@@ itre@@ a ; a struggle for this jag@@ ged , controversial line called for hundreds of lives in June .
analysts fear that separ@@ ati@@ sts such as the O@@ rom@@ o Liberation Front or the National Liberation Front of O@@ ga@@ den have been forced to utilize the turbul@@ ence over the past few years and be able to re@@ arm themselves .
several factors explain why feelings of bitter@@ ness explo@@ de after years of t@@ ink@@ age beneath the surface .
the first seems harmless : smartphones .
only in recent years , many Ethiop@@ ians have been able to communicate with the social media , since cheaper smartphones have become more and more frequent and the internet services improved .
even if the government locks the access to Facebook and Twitter , which it does at regular intervals , especially in protests , many people still can communicate via Internet pro@@ x@@ ies that hide where they reside .
several young Ethiop@@ ians stated that they were so prot@@ esting .
the second factor is that there is more solidarity between the O@@ ro@@ mos and Am@@ har@@ as , the two largest ethnic groups in Ethiopia .
the O@@ ro@@ mos and Am@@ har@@ as are not natural enemies .
for e@@ ons , the Am@@ har@@ as , who come from Ethiopia mainly Christian high @-@ lands , prosp@@ eri@@ ed in politics and economy as they exploited the O@@ ro@@ mos , many of whom are Muslims and live in low@@ land areas .
but that also changes .
&quot; we are here to coordinate below a screen , &quot; said Mul@@ at@@ u Gem@@ ech@@ u , a leader of the O@@ ro@@ mos .
the biggest protests took place in areas of the Am@@ har@@ a and O@@ ro@@ mos .
many Am@@ har@@ as and O@@ ro@@ mos have the feeling that Ethiopia illeg@@ ally dominated by members of the ethnic group of the Tig@@ ray who account for about 6 per cent of the population and are dominant in the military , intelligence services , trade and politics .
the third reason for the un@@ rest is the death of Mel@@ es Zen@@ awi .
Mr. Mel@@ es , a former rebel leader , was Ethiop@@ ian Prime Minister until his death in 2012 for 17 years .
he was seen as a tac@@ tical genius , a man who could think around corners .
analysts say that he was particularly interested in perc@@ ei@@ ving early signs of dis@@ satisfaction and using special officers to process opponents and make them harmless .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the current regime lacks this basic skill , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mr Ab@@ di , a conflict analy@@ st . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ethiop@@ ian new Prime Minister , H@@ ail@@ em@@ ari@@ am Des@@ al@@ eg@@ n , was chosen for relatively unclear reasons to take the position of Mr Mel@@ es .
unlike Mr. Mel@@ es , who came from the Tig@@ ray region of Northern Ethiop@@ ian , Mr. H@@ ail@@ em@@ ari@@ am comes from the south .
analysts say that he does not enjoy the confidence of the security services controlled by the Tig@@ ray .
many fear that the result will be more blood@@ shed .
the last time Ethiopia experienced such a tur@@ mo@@ il in 2005 , after thousands of poll@@ s prot@@ ested , apparently ple@@ dged by the government according to information by analysts and then stolen .
during the following ra@@ ids many prot@@ esters were killed , even if there were less than in the last months and this period of un@@ rest was passing relatively quickly .
development experts praised Ethiop@@ ian leaders for their vision@@ ary infrastructure planning , such as the new commu@@ ter train , and their meas@@ urable progress in comb@@ ating poverty .
but evi@@ dently this did not prevent the intensi@@ fication of the internal mis@@ conception of the Ethiop@@ ian government .
and it assumes a dangerous ethnic form .
last month prot@@ esters in Gon@@ dar , an am@@ per@@ sian city , attacked by Tig@@ ray and hatred of the Tig@@ ray becomes more and more common in the social media .
analysts say that the protests brought the US and other Western allies into a peculiar position .
the American government used Ethiopia as a base for D@@ ron@@ en@@ flights over neighboring Somalia , even though it has recently announced that it has closed this base .
while the West is un@@ equi@@ vocal to support democracy , he does not want his ally to collapse in an already volati@@ le area .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mr Ab@@ di , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is a very thin ti@@ ght@@ rope walk . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Donald Tr@@ ump explains Obama &apos;s claim that IS@@ IS was founded &quot; sar@@ cas@@ m &quot;
Donald J. Tr@@ ump tried to disp@@ el the last controversy surrounding his campaign by attacking his multi @-@ repeated asser@@ tion , President Obama and H@@ illary Clinton , the &quot; founder &quot; of the terrorist group Islamic State , not seriously meant .
this clari@@ fication threw new questions on the communication skills of the Republi@@ can candidate , whether he was able to communicate clearly and understandable with the American public .
it also brings along those comrades who endeav@@ our to protect him during an event@@ ful phase , in the peculiar position to declare statements which he could not have meant at all .
after having made the announcement at an election campaign on Wednesday evening , Mr. Tr@@ ump ru@@ ined in reference to the claim on Thursday and insi@@ sted in interviews that he really did not intend to suggest , the President and Mrs. Clinton had created IS@@ IS .
but in an early morning T@@ we@@ et on Friday Mr. Tr@@ ump said he was simply sar@@ c@@ astic .
the T@@ we@@ et was the opposite to the previous day Mr. Tr@@ ump said in a number of interviews , he said the accus@@ ation completely serious .
when the conservative Radi@@ om@@ oder@@ ator Hu@@ gh He@@ wit@@ t asked Mr. Tr@@ ump to weak@@ en the statement by remin@@ ding him that Mr. Obama wants to destroy IS@@ IS , the Republi@@ can candidate wanted nothing of it .
the last storm of criticism rush@@ es down on Mr. Tr@@ ump , while he tried to ste@@ er the focus of his campaign because of falling changes in the economic situation .
Mr. Tr@@ ump and Mrs. Clinton kept talking about the economic situation in Mich@@ ig@@ an this week .
on Friday Mr. Tr@@ ump tried to return to this subject again .
talking about Twitter he warned that Mrs. Clinton &apos;s proposals would lead to higher taxes and that he found their speech boring .
Mr. Tr@@ ump has already brought sar@@ cas@@ m to his defense .
at the end of July he strongly critic@@ ised himself when he said the Russians should h@@ ack Mrs. Clinton &apos;s emails , but later he explained &quot; Of course , I thought the sar@@ c@@ astic . &quot;
this method allows Mr. Tr@@ ump to post@@ p@@ one the linguistic boundaries in politics and then return to demand .
&quot; I think it &apos;s one of his methods to test how certain messages are received by his fans as they arrive , and then &quot; clarify &quot; depending on how the reaction drops out . &quot; Ruth Sher@@ man , a communication expert who ob@@ serves the language of both candidates .
but I also think he &apos;s clever enough to keep his statements vag@@ ue enough so that they can be interpreted in a number of ways .
instead of def@@ using the tone for the presidential election , Mr. Tr@@ ump has accepted an even more estimated tone , as his demand has continued to decline .
a new survey by N@@ BC / Wall Street Journal / Mar@@ ist , published on Friday , showed a leading edge in the states North Carolina , Virginia , Colorado and a head @-@ to @-@ head race in Florida .
while Mr. Tr@@ ump has generally tried to excuse his pro@@ voc@@ ative remarks , he often acc@@ uses his critics to dist@@ ort his statements or mis@@ understand his humour .
but while he is increasingly focusing on the attention in the last months of his presidential campaign , Mr. Tr@@ um@@ ps Scher@@ ze has brought his loyal fel@@ lows into the uncomfortable situation to stand up to him regardless of how pro@@ voc@@ ative his statements might be .
Rudol@@ ph W. Giuli@@ ani , former Mayor of New York and one of Tr@@ um@@ ps &apos;s most prominent interc@@ essors , was struggling to defend the candidate today in a CN@@ N interview on Thursday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I believe what he says are legitimate , political comments , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mr Giuli@@ ani told him about the correctness of Mr. Tr@@ um@@ ps statements about whether Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton had founded the Islamic State . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is true in this sense that before Obama IS an almost unknown , small organisation , he called them Hinter@@ b@@ än@@ kler , completely wrong and that &apos;s why it happened because he with@@ drew the troops from Iraq .
most mainstream rep@@ ublic@@ ans attempt to argue that the government under Obama , in which Mrs. Clinton served as Foreign Minister , allowed IS@@ IS to spread by making it aggressive in the Middle East .
prior to the election campaign events in Pennsylvania on Friday , Mr. Tr@@ ump continued his attacks on the media and accused them of running on each of his words and being pre@@ ju@@ dic@@ ed against him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he ridi@@ cul@@ ed the &quot; poor &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; poor &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; television experts who try to understand him and said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; They cannot do it ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
some of the democr@@ ats mo@@ cked Mr. Tr@@ um@@ ps &apos;s ap@@ ology as mere evidence that he was un@@ suitable for the presi@@ dency .
once pushed over the price of the market , Café arrives in Green@@ point
Ver@@ b Cafe was a col@@ os@@ sal café in Willi@@ am@@ sburg , where you could only pay cash , which had no Wi @-@ Fi , but for this for 15 years served good coffee .
of course , the prices of his Bed@@ ford Avenue store were crowded .
the So@@ ap Cher@@ ie shop , which took place in the summer of 2014 , sells soap in the form of cup@@ cakes .
local residents saw it as the last lost in a gent@@ ri@@ fying city .
the artist Mol@@ ly Cra@@ b@@ apple wrote on Twitter , &quot; I know New York is change , but I still can &apos;t believe that CB@@ GB is dead , the Chelsea Hotel is exemp@@ ted and there is now a soap shop . &quot;
but if New York is change , then it is also new discovery .
a revi@@ ved Ver@@ b Cafe opened last November in Green@@ point , less than a mile north from its original location .
the new verb has Wi @-@ Fi and accepts credit cards , but still has some of the same staff and a similarly simple atmosphere .
the coffee is still good .
the new owner of the club is Cisco Rodri@@ gu@@ ez , a long @-@ standing employee of the old café , the owner and managing director of the new café .
he started working in Ver@@ b in 2001 and remained there until the end .
when a client offered him to provide funds for a new office , he was excited to do it , he said .
Rodri@@ gu@@ ez , 36 , did a lot .
Ver@@ b uses the same distributor for the bag@@ els bought the same es@@ presso machine model .
it even uses the same lamps from the old verb .
but Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said he wanted to experiment .
he introduced new ingredients .
on the menu there are sand@@ wiches with bac@@ on and cheese , and there are gar@@ nish@@ es like cap@@ ers and sau@@ ted onions .
there are natural white dishes .
the café does not serve beer , but there are fresh juices .
after nine months Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said he had noticed a steady stream of old regular customers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many old customers were also pushed out by price from Willi@@ am@@ sburg , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
recently , on a Sunday , Rebecca Oli@@ v@@ eira was such a client .
Oli@@ v@@ eira , 34 , lived in Willi@@ am@@ sburg and visited the club regularly .
even after having moved to Green@@ point , she would take the path .
after the verb had closed , she gave the coffee drink for a while , she said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it became clear to me that it was on the coffee and the culture in the verb that pleased me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
now she drinks coffee again , even if she ordered a bl@@ ended Cha@@ i Tea on that day instead of her usual iced coffee , which is another new addition .
Tom Ros@@ enthal has been a long@@ standing and loyal customer since the beginning of the verb in 2003 .
he went there before work and in@@ vari@@ ably ordered the same .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I came after seven , every day , like a Swiss pocket watch and they prepare my Every@@ thing Ba@@ gel with butter , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
photo Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said he wanted to experiment and add new ingredients to the menu .
today Ros@@ enthal still gets his usual order , but sometimes he changes his Every@@ thing @-@ Ba@@ gel with bac@@ on , egg and cheese .
Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said that he had no res@@ ent@@ ment about the fact that the soap shop took the old business space .
in fact , the owners of So@@ ap Cher@@ ie offered to produce a special soap with cold bre@@ wed coffee of the coffee bar as an ingredient .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think we will go on to offer more , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Rodri@@ gu@@ ez . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and the traditional Polish inhabitants Green@@ points also accepted the café .
a new customer has translated the menu into Polish and Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said that he pre@@ tends to issue her soon so that his new neighbours feel welcome .
the location has further advantages .
a local juice bar wants to fill and sell the cold @-@ bre@@ wed coffee .
there is a chance that the café expands to a neighboring building .
for many customers , a new verb is sufficient to get their old favour@@ ites .
Joseph W@@ itt was a regular customer and said he was destroyed on the ground when the café closed .
when the new café opened , Wh@@ itt stated that entering the restaurant and ordering a new coffee felt like a hom@@ ec@@ oming .
&quot; I had to smell , &quot; he said .
the de@@ pressing food of the economic crisis in &quot; a rich meal &quot;
in March 1933 , shortly after his rise to the President , Fran@@ klin Del@@ ano Ro@@ os@@ ev@@ elt took his lunch at the O@@ val Office .
as a g@@ our@@ mets , President Ro@@ os@@ ev@@ elt had a fai@@ ble for refined delic@@ at@@ essen on Fi@@ fth Avenue like P@@ â@@ te de fo@@ ie gr@@ as and Mary@@ land ter@@ rap@@ in soup .
his menu on that day was a bit more modest : stuff@@ ed eggs in tomato sauce , m@@ ashed potatoes and as dessert a pl@@ um pu@@ dding .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was an act of culinary solidarity with suffering people , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Jane Ziegel@@ man . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; her husband Andrew Co@@ e added , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; It was also a message to the Americans how they should eat . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the couple lives in Brooklyn Heights and are both food histori@@ ans .
co@@ es last book &quot; C@@ hop Su@@ ey &quot; was based on Chinese cuisine in the USA , while Ziegel@@ man told in her book &quot; 97 Orch@@ ard &quot; about life in a residential building on the Lower East Side of the food perspective .
their latest collaboration , &quot; A decent meal , &quot; which will appear on Tuesday at Har@@ per Verlag , illustrates the history of American cuisine during the Great Depression .
they showed culinary solidarity when they met with a repor@@ ter at the Eis@@ enberg &apos;s Sand@@ wich Shop for dinner , a small , snor@@ kel I@@ mb@@ iss in the Fl@@ ati@@ ron District , which has been in business since the crash crash in 1929 .
brick kil@@ n , 54 , ordered a fresh cheese sandwich with olive pieces , while Co@@ e , 57 , tur@@ key with m@@ ashed potatoes and vegetable mixture ate .
when the repor@@ ter ordered ham@@ mer@@ ing , this found the couple to discuss the food in the era of Great Depression .
&quot; rich foods were very popular , &quot; Ziegel@@ man said .
there was pe@@ an@@ ut bread , liver cheese and bean bread .
they were made from an ingredient and a little cheaper that stretches the ingredient .
imagine eating so many pe@@ an@@ uts that they serve them as dinner .
Co@@ E gr@@ inn@@ ed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it must have been in the stomach such as lead , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the years before the Great Depression , the table was in an American budget , especially in rural areas , an all @-@ you @-@ Can @-@ E@@ at buffet .
teams of women were cooking for male fel@@ lows and it was served freshly baked past@@ es for breakfast , lunch and dinner .
it was the Americans who sent food to star@@ ving Europeans during the First World War . &quot; a Square Me@@ al &quot; traces the roads with which the country was going to be no longer the land of land .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was a time when food was a central theme for the Americans , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Co@@ e beg@@ ged why he and his wife wanted to write about it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the new budget was just as ten@@ se : mysterious food such as bre@@ ads and c@@ asser@@ ol@@ es became stap@@ le food , re@@ ass@@ uring the c@@ asser@@ ole dish as a &quot; wonderful way , food lef@@ to@@ vers , &quot; as chefs were able to hide appeti@@ zing ingredients under a cre@@ amy sauce .
fresh fruit was replaced by cheaper dry fruit .
meat that was the center of American cuisine for years became a rare luxury .
odd mixes have been tried as a cal@@ orie @-@ rich and nutri@@ tious satisfaction predomin@@ ates with taste or even healthy cuisine .
while resear@@ ching the book , which includes recipes , Ziegel@@ man prepared a dish of this epoch , baked onions with pe@@ an@@ ut butter .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was not a popular addition to lunch , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Co@@ e . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ziegel@@ man proceeds further : &quot; it was sur@@ real . &quot;
pe@@ an@@ ut butter and baked onions do not match each other .
it was typical for many of the household recipes .
as never before , or ever since , budget econom@@ ists - including Lou@@ ise Stan@@ ley , head of the Federal Bureau of Home Economics from 1923 to 1943 - performed the country &apos;s eating habits .
by publishing recipes and articles in newspapers and magazines , they encouraged women to become &quot; household politicians , &quot; and the challenge of converting P@@ amp@@ e like cre@@ amy sp@@ aghetti with car@@ rots into delicious meals .
&quot; a Square Me@@ al &quot; is a feast of historic treats .
especially tasty are the reports about the response of the government to the star@@ ving citizens , as President Herbert Hoo@@ ver &apos;s L@@ ass @-@ me @-@ Cake @-@ Food attitude .
while he publicly praised the simple I@@ owa farm kitchen of his kitchen , he fed like the million@@ fold man of the world he became .
&quot; he liked continental cooking like fish with a cu@@ cum@@ ber sauce , &quot; Co@@ e said .
he ate in an almost gold @-@ plated dining room and wore a tu@@ x@@ edo .
he was deli@@ ght@@ fully realistic .
President Ro@@ os@@ ev@@ elt may have committed the same mistake if his wife Ele@@ an@@ or had asked him to make an example with his stomach .
as described in the book , the director of a house@@ keeper with no interest in flavors caused by Mr@@ s Ro@@ os@@ ev@@ elt that the White House brought forth the most boring food in Washington , but also one of the most dri@@ est ones . &quot;
many of the species from the era of Great Depression to deal with food was rejected once the land came back to the legs .
the legacy lies on our continuing focus on calories and food , said Bri@@ ck@@ man , as well as how science was applied to food .
the couple gave a better understanding of the eating habits of Ziegel@@ man &apos;s mother @-@ in @-@ law when writing the book - for example how she could not throw away food .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she had a real fear of food waste , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Co@@ e said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; brick one remembered : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she really made people sick . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there was the wind@@ fall of the wind .
after the dishes were cleared from Eis@@ enberg &apos;s , they and Co@@ e produced a dessert that they had prepared at home : the pl@@ um recipe that President Ro@@ os@@ ev@@ elt ate for lunch .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is called Pr@@ une Whi@@ p , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bri@@ ck@@ man and added that it was a common trick to miss modest recipes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there was no whi@@ pped cream , only pr@@ un@@ es , some flour , sugar , water and cinnamon .
everyone di@@ pped something reluc@@ t@@ antly a spoon in the t@@ amed , brown gli@@ b@@ ber .
amaz@@ ingly , it ta@@ sted not bad .
Co@@ E took three times a supplement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; like a Can @-@ Do @-@ Bud@@ ge@@ ti@@ erer he said to his wife , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some chopped wal@@ nuts would help . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
killed during bomb attack : he was the hero of Ale@@ ppo
he put his own life on the game to help others : Khal@@ ed O@@ mar .
he was the hero of Ale@@ ppo : Khal@@ ed O@@ mar devoted his life to the people of Syria .
he ris@@ ked everything to save others life .
now the 30 @-@ year @-@ old has died of a barrel bomb attack by the Assad regime .
O@@ mar was a member of the &quot; White Helm@@ ets , &quot; a civil protection group that , according to the Bild @-@ Zeitung , saved almost 60@@ ,000 people alive .
29@@ 00 volunteers put their own lives on the game in order to draw people from bom@@ bed houses and to provide first aid in the war zone .
they are the heroes of the war in Syria .
O@@ mar was the group &apos;s face : a video of the Civil Guard , which shows him during an 11 @-@ hour saving of an acid from the ruins of a house , went around the world in 2014 .
it made the Syrian a shining symbol figure in the horror of the war .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but he never saw himself as heroes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for me this is the real Ji@@ had . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if I die to save lives , I think God sees in me a mart@@ yr . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
shortly before O@@ mar itself fell victim to an attack , he had spoken in a video about the last bom@@ b@@ ings in Syria .
the helicop@@ ters have four barrel bombs on the Alz@@ hei@@ a district , one of which was filled with chlorine gas .
one woman and two children died , seven people suffer from short@@ ness of breath .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we now eliminate the po@@ ison@@ ous remains of the bomb , so that not children play with it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the image c@@ ites his last words before he died . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the deadly bomb of the Assad regime had to hit terrorists .
Greenland shar@@ k : the oldest verteb@@ rate is almost 400 years old
rare sight .
Greenland &apos;s sh@@ arks usually come to the surface only in winter .
after an investigation , this shar@@ k was allowed to return to the sea aboard the S@@ anna research vessel .
it was born in 16@@ 24 and flo@@ ats with a good 1 km / h through the North Atlantic - to this day .
Greenland is only 150 years old .
lei@@ surely the Greenland shar@@ k swi@@ ms along the bottom of the North Atlantic , in one hour it reaches an average just 1,@@ 220 meters .
only when it counts , the five @-@ metre @-@ long animal acceler@@ ates to a full 2.6 km / h - and is half as fast as a seal with this top speed .
this lifestyle shaped by slow@@ ness seems to be a recipe for a high age .
Julius N@@ iel@@ sen from the University of Copenhagen and his colleagues reported in the journal &quot; Science &quot; at least a Greenland shar@@ k who could be 3@@ 92 years old .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ins@@ anity , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Alexander Sch@@ euer@@ lein of the Max Planck Institute for demographic research in Rostock , this life span , which means a world record for verteb@@ rates . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the evolution@@ ist bi@@ ologist believed for a long time that Greenland is st@@ ony .
only lack@@ ed the evidence .
Greenland is difficult to observe , after all , they live mainly in the ice sea in front of the thin@@ ly populated coasts of Canada , Greenland , Norway and S@@ val@@ bard .
because they prefer water temperatures around the six degrees Celsius , they usually appear on the surface only in winter .
researchers know little about the lifestyle of Greenland .
their slow motion measures them , when they held six animals with a transmitter in front of S@@ val@@ bard .
prey makes this sh@@ arks nevertheless : in the stomach of an animal researchers found the remains of a seal , another had swal@@ lowed the jaw bone of a young polar bear .
they may hunt sleeping animals or pat@@ rol on the bottom of the ice @-@ sea and look for cad@@ aver , which tor@@ ped@@ oes from higher water @-@ layers down .
Julius N@@ iel@@ sen and his colleagues now investigated 28 Greenland F@@ ever , the fishermen between 2010 and 2013 brought to Greenland or S@@ val@@ bard as by@@ catch from the depth of the North Atlantic .
the smallest shar@@ k was just 81 cm long , while the biggest 50@@ 2 cen@@ timeter measured .
in order to determine the age of the animals , they analyzed the lens nucle@@ us of the sh@@ arks with the carbon @-@ 14 method .
this centre of the eye lens is created before the birth of the sh@@ arks , the proteins contained in it are later no longer re@@ done .
the two smallest sh@@ arks had remarkably much carbon @-@ 14 in the lens nucle@@ us .
their birth should therefore be after the early 1960s , when nuclear weapons search increased large amounts of this radioactive carbon into the atmosphere .
in the third @-@ smallest animal with 220 centimet@@ res of length , the lens nucle@@ us , on the other hand , contained a small excess of carbon @-@ 14 from nuclear weapons , so it is likely to have celebrated its 50@@ th birthday in 2012 .
in their l@@ enti@@ cular nucle@@ us , however , all larger Greenland @-@ ha@@ i@@ ves had normal carbon @-@ 14 amounts created by cosmic rays in the atmosphere .
in fact , the carbon @-@ 14 @-@ clock showed an age of 3@@ 35 centimet@@ res for a 4@@ 93 centimet@@ re long Greenland shar@@ k , while the record Ha@@ i with 50@@ 2 centimet@@ res would be even 3@@ 92 years old .
that Greenland shar@@ k females only get offspring when they are longer than four meters , was known .
now the researchers were able to assign an age to the length .
since one of the animals with 3@@ 92 centimet@@ res probably stood at the threshold of the sexually mature and its age was determined at 156 years , Greenland ha@@ i@@ red with the increase obviously can be at least one and a half centuries .
this is also likely to be world record for verteb@@ rates .
it is no coincidence that such met@@ e@@ al@@ isations live mainly in icy waters .
the previous record holder , a 211 year old Greenland whale , in whose bac@@ on at the neck had a 120 @-@ year @-@ old har@@ poon tip , was caught in front of Alaska .
due to the low temperatures , the organism of the living animals often runs on as@@ par@@ ag@@ us flame .
so they mature later - and age slow@@ ed down .
in order to keep warm in the cold water , the animals are often particularly large .
because the volume grows much faster than its surface through which the animal gets heat .
the loss of heat from one gram of mouse is therefore much larger than one gram of elephant .
another advantage : you have fewer enemies .
&quot; a smaller animal is therefore more dangerous and should concentrate on having as many offspring as possible , &quot; explains the evolution@@ ist bi@@ ologist Sch@@ euer@@ lein .
a very big animal should , on the other hand , invest its resources into a long life .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the body facilit@@ ated the communication of Mayor Robert P@@ utz that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; finally the marketing of the recently designated areas of housing can begin . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the land , par@@ cel@@ ing and closing questions were clari@@ fied and the applications for sur@@ veying could be made , the sale of the land in the residential areas of &quot; Street Road &quot; and &quot; Schön@@ au @-@ West &quot; ( section Bin@@ der@@ straße - section 1 ) is no longer in the way to interested parties .
the municipal council is convinced that the construction areas in the rural and quiet residential community of Schön@@ au appeal to young families and elderly sen@@ iors alike .
as it was said , the members of the building can report to the town hall as of now , and the municipal council is expected to advise the municipal council in its September meeting .
in order to also en@@ quiries about the settlement of further commercial enterprises , connected with the creation of jobs , the municipal council decided to change the land use plan newly created in the spring of this year .
thus in the area of Lower @-@ tim@@ lar@@ n the already designated industrial zone is extended by two plots in the direction of state road 2@@ 112 .
Frankfurt benefits from Bre@@ x@@ it
according to this , the city on the Main has the best opportunities to attract new jobs and companies from London in the competition with Paris , Dublin and Luxembourg .
&quot; it is very likely that Frankfurt will benefit most from the Bre@@ x@@ it V@@ ot@@ um , &quot; says Michael Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ länder , head of the financial markets and real estate markets of the I@@ W .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the Bre@@ x@@ it referendum it is uncertain whether they are allowed to continue operating from London from financial transactions across the EU . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for the so @-@ called EU passport , they have been granted approval in the UK so far .
that &apos;s what big US banks are using .
several banks have already announced to shift jobs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the lobby association &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Frankfurt Main Finance &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reck@@ ons with 10@@ 000 new jobs in the Main within five years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for Frankfurt , like the I@@ W , the seat of the European Central Bank ( ECB ) , which combines responsibility for monetary policy and supervision over the largest banks in the euro@@ zone , as well as other important authorities , such as the European insurance view , E@@ IO@@ PA and the risk score ES@@ R@@ B .
in Paris , the Organisation for Economic Co @-@ operation and Development ( OECD ) has its headquarters , but this is less significant for the financial sector than the ECB .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; proximity to the central bank is important for banks as they can communicate directly with the supervision , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says I@@ W Professor Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ länder . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Luxembourg , though , hides a large fund sector , but also cuts down the infrastructure of Dublin as well as Dublin .
Frankfurt is much easier to reach thanks to the large airport .
further points are the city with readily available commercial properties .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Paris it is not so easy to find free high @-@ quality offices , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ länder . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the River Seine , rent for first @-@ class commercial real estate was 50 percent higher than the Main River .
furthermore , Frankfurt offers a higher quality of life than competition thanks to good medical care and infrastructure and less crime .
in a ranking of the company consulting Mer@@ cer , the city was ranked 7th , Luxembourg in place 19 , Dublin in place 33 and Paris at 3@@ 7th place .
even if quality of life is a question of preferences : &quot; with its already strong position as a financial centre for the European single market , Frankfurt could attract more banks and investors , &quot; the I@@ W concluded .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but London will remain the most important financial centre in Europe despite Bre@@ x@@ it @-@ V@@ ot@@ um , my econom@@ ists . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to figures from the Landes@@ bank Hel@@ aba by the end of 2015 , around 14@@ 4,000 people in the banking industry , in Frankfurt , were 6@@ 2500 .
Gilead receives legal costs from hepatitis C patent dispute with Mer@@ ck
a U.S. office judge decided that Gilead Sciences Inc has claimed the reimbur@@ sement of legal costs arising from the H@@ ep@@ ati@@ ts C dispute with the pharmaceutical company Mer@@ ck &amp; Co Inc .
in June , Gilead was liber@@ ated from a fee of $ 200 million for the violation of two Mer@@ ck patents , which were related to the block@@ bu@@ ster drugs so@@ val@@ di and Har@@ von@@ i of Gilead , after a US judge uncovered a pattern of mis@@ conduct on the part of Mer@@ ck , including the Mein@@ ei@@ des and other un@@ ethical actions .
when the complaint was raised on Thursday , US officials at Beth Lab@@ son Fre@@ eman said that Gilead is entitled to the reduction of the costs incurred during the defence of the case .
Mer@@ ck tries to equ@@ ate Gilead , which controls the market of a new generation of hepatitis C drugs that can cure over 90 percent of patients with liver disease .
the case goes back to 2013 when Gilead and Mer@@ ck compl@@ ained and claimed property on laboratory work to which Sof@@ os@@ bu@@ vir granted the active ingredient in the drugs of Gilead .
troops supported by the US say that they reg@@ ained full control over Man@@ bi@@ j by the Islamic State .
troops supported by the United States have rec@@ ap@@ tured full control of the northern city of Man@@ bi@@ j near the Turkish border after the last IS fighters in the city left them , a spokes@@ man of the group said on Friday .
the Democratic Forces of Syria ( EC@@ SC ) are cur@@ bing the city at the moment after the removal of the remaining group of fighters who have buried themselves within the city .
they have delivered over 2,000 civilians who were held ho@@ stages by the fighters , Shar@@ fan informed Dar@@ wish of the Man@@ bi@@ j military council of Reu@@ ters , al@@ lied with the D@@ KS .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the city is now under complete control , but we just carry out cleaning work , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he told Reu@@ ters . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Clin@@ tons earn 10.@@ 75 million in 2015 and pay 3@@ 4.2 % federal taxes
H@@ illary Clinton released its tax return for 2015 on Friday , which revealed an income of USD 10.@@ 75 million for the Pres@@ idential candidate of the Democrats and her husband and an effective federal tax rate of 3@@ 4.2 % .
in 2015 , the Clinton Foundation donated USD 1 million for char@@ itable purposes , mainly to the Clinton Foundation ; former Secretary of State Bill Clinton generated almost USD 5.3 million in oral speeches ; the former Secretary of State issued an income of USD 3 million from the publishing house Simon &amp; Schu@@ ster for their official time in the State Department .
Clinton &apos;s candidate for Vice Pres@@ i@@ dency , Sen@@ ator Tim ka@@ ine from Virginia , together with his wife Anne Hol@@ ton , published his tax declarations for the last ten years .
they paid an effective federal tax rate of 20.@@ 3 % in 2015 .
&quot; H@@ illary Clinton and Tim ka@@ ine continue to set standards in terms of financial transparency , &quot; said Clinton &apos;s Camp@@ aig@@ n hel@@ per in J@@ enni@@ fer Pal@@ mier@@ i in a statement .
in a stark contrast , Donald Tr@@ ump is hiding behind false statements and backs in reference to his previous promises to publish his tax returns .
it is common for US presidential candidates to publish their tax declarations , although they are not obliged to do so by law .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Tr@@ ump , a New York business@@ man , and his lawyers have declared a tax audit by the tax authorities as a reason for his refusal . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; they are on the train , &quot; wrote Clinton &apos;s election campaign in Ian S@@ ams on Twitter , in relation to the publication of the Pres@@ idential candidate of the Democrats .
on Thursday , Michael Coh@@ en , Tr@@ um@@ ps Special Ad@@ visor , told CN@@ N that he would not allow Tr@@ ump to publish something before the tax audi@@ ts are not complete .
Tr@@ um@@ ps Cri@@ tics , including the Republi@@ can presidential candidate of the year 2012 Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney , have already deser@@ ted that his refusal to raise questions related to wealth , donations for chari@@ ties , business models and various other connections , especially with Russia .
Clinton has already over@@ thrown himself on the subject and released a video on the internet on Friday in which high @-@ ranking Republi@@ can Tr@@ ump requests to publish his tax return .
on Thursday , she also addressed the topic during a speech on the economy in Mich@@ ig@@ an .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he refuses to do what any other presidential candidate has done in recent decades and publish his tax returns . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said to the crowd . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Politi@@ co reported that during the 1990s , Tr@@ ump paid no or very little taxes during the 1990s , and a business journalist of the New York Times quoted a number of tax lawyers and tax advis@@ ors on Friday , stating that this could still be the case .
Federal taxes have become a topic in the election campaign .
Clinton supports a scheme named after the billi@@ on@@ aire and investor War@@ ren Buff@@ ett , which would ensure that individuals who earn more than USD 1 million will pay a tax rate of at least 30 % .
President Obama also supports the proposal .
during an election campaign for H@@ illary Clinton in O@@ ma@@ ha , Neb@@ ras@@ ka , Buff@@ ett , whose Ber@@ k@@ shire H@@ ath@@ away industrial con@@ glomer@@ ate has its headquarters here , called Tr@@ ump to discuss their tax returns .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Buff@@ ett said he was also subjected to a tax check of the I@@ RS and sent &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fear &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in front of voters and not before tax authorities . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Clinton &apos;s campaign has released tax returns until 2007 .
the Clinton , who now live in Ch@@ app@@ aqua , New York , on average paid an effective federal tax rate of approx . 32 % between 2007 and 2014 and an effective combined tax rate of approx . 40@@ ,5 % .
the tax return of the 2015 Clin@@ ton showed that these were only USD 100 of their income compared to the majority of all Americans .
their main investment position was a cost @-@ effective index fund from which the Clin@@ tons distributed divi@@ den@@ ds and income from USD 10@@ 9@@ ,000 .

con@@ doms with ch@@ ili@@ es , fire@@ works promote Tanz@@ anian eleph@@ ants protection
conserv@@ ation@@ ists in Tanzania use an un@@ orthodo@@ x way to prevent eleph@@ ants from walking in people inhabited settlements - they throw con@@ doms on them that are filled with ch@@ ili@@ es .
the method has proven to be effective and the Hon@@ ey@@ guide Foundation , who had the idea already years ago , intensified their funding by training volunteers in villages in northern Tanzania to use a non @-@ violent four @-@ stage method to protect their homes and harvest without hur@@ ting animals .
before that , many sp@@ ears used to defend themselves .
Friday is a day of the World , dedicated to animal welfare .
&quot; since we have developed the ... Tool@@ kit , we were able to observe a change in attitudes within these communities , much more confident that they can stop the eleph@@ ants from their fields without harm to the elephant , &quot; said Hon@@ ey@@ guide Dam@@ ian Bell &apos;s managing director in a message .
the first two steps include the light@@ ness of the elephant with a torch and the bubbles in a horn .
if it is not deter@@ red , a so @-@ called &quot; chim@@ e cloud &quot; is thrown .
ch@@ ili@@ es mixed with earth is packed together with a fire@@ work body into a con@@ dom , whose end is turned to the ignition cord .
when it is lit , the con@@ dom he@@ ats up with a b@@ ang and spray fine dust into the air .
a breeze usually already looks out to chase the elephant .
a last chance is a row@@ er who shoots a fire@@ works fire@@ works in the air , causing a loud , bright explosion .
city council unanim@@ ously decides : no kick @-@ off of ki@@ os@@ ks on the St. Go@@ arer Rhein@@ u@@ fer
in general , the St. Go@@ ar investment projects of commercial business@@ men with K@@ us@@ sh@@ and are accepted - but the retail trade in the core capital is clearly exp@@ and@@ able .
the City Council , however , unanim@@ ously rejected the application for the new construction of a sal@@ es@@ in@@ sky on the banks of the Rhine in the immediate vicinity of the Rhine navigation system on the Rhine .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; basically we welcome new traders , but at this location in an exposed position on the banks of the Rhine , this ki@@ osk does not fit , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Michael Hu@@ br@@ ath for the CD@@ U . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Jewish director dis@@ integrates Berlin Hotel because Israeli pres@@ election was removed after &quot; Arab &quot; call - RT News
a French director with Jewish roots un@@ le@@ ashed a media watch after he had betra@@ yed that the Kemp@@ inski B@@ rist@@ ol Hotel in Berlin did not list Israeli elections as Arab guests had &quot; requested &quot; according to a staff . &quot;
Claude Lanz@@ mann , author of the Holocaust documentation &quot; Sho@@ ah &quot; left his anger at the Kemp@@ inski B@@ rist@@ ol Hotel in Berlin , writing an open letter to the German newspaper FA@@ Z .
during his last stay , Lanz@@ mann tried to find Israel on the country code list of the hotel .
however , the country was not listed between the countries which can be inv@@ oked directly from the hotel room .
how is it possible in 2016 in Berlin , the capital of the new Germany , that Israel was eliminated and deleted ?
wrote Lanz@@ mann .
instead , the Kemp@@ in@@ ks@@ i B@@ rist@@ ol offers a possibility to choose Israel via its own call center .
looking for an explanation , the director turned to the hotel reception .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the answer he received was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; shocked him &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; as Lanz@@ mann wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the hotel staff said that the measure was a &quot; deliber@@ ate decision of the management of the Kemp@@ inski Hotel . &quot;
the reason behind it triggered even more anger in the director .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the majority of our guests are Arabs and they have demanded that the pres@@ election is er@@ ased , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was quoted by Lanz@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Israeli ambassador in Germany Y@@ ak@@ ov Ha@@ das @-@ Handels@@ man called this a &quot; big shame , &quot; reports the Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung .
we were horri@@ fied and dis@@ ma@@ yed by this event .
that really is very sham@@ eful .
the fact that this has happened in Germany in exactly this hotel chain is even greater dis@@ grace .
this does not require any explanation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we expect the hotel to draw the right conclusions , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the minister . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the incident triggered a rather large resonance on the Internet , in which people called the whole a sc@@ andal .
some submitted to the Kemp@@ inski Hotel that there would have been the alleged re@@ for@@ estation of Arab guests . &quot;
&quot; be ashamed , &quot; it was said in another article in which it was pointed out that the hotel , which is located at the noble Kur@@ für@@ sten@@ damm , stands near a synagogue .
the hotel quickly dismissed all accus@@ ations and called the incident a &quot; mistake &quot; and &quot; ap@@ ologi@@ zed &quot; at Lanz@@ mann , reports Der Spiegel .
&quot; there was never a direct order , &quot; Israel did not enter the quick selection list , &quot; the Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung quoted a spokes@@ man for the Kemp@@ inski Hotel .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it adds that the country code has been added . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
police put tear gas &amp; rubber bul@@ lets against prot@@ esting Brazilian students
on Thursday , students joined the Brazilian city of Sao Paulo with the police when they gathered to protest against the government &apos;s reforms for the public education system .
the police used tear gas and rubber bul@@ lets against the demonstr@@ ators .
the difficulties began when police officers tried to disper@@ se the students , causing the police to insert rubber bul@@ lets and tear gas .
several hundred students participated in the demonstrations to put their const@@ ern@@ ation on the plans .
according to the Govern@@ ors of the Federal State of Sao Paulo Ger@@ al@@ do Al@@ ck@@ min , a little less than 100 public schools are closed , while 300@@ ,000 students are converted to save money .
some of the demonstr@@ ators saw gra@@ ff@@ iti on walls spra@@ ying against the provisional president Michel Tem@@ er .
the recent protests took place several days after demonstr@@ ators went onto the streets to support the suspended President Dil@@ ma Rous@@ se@@ ff , who had been removed from office by a vote of the Senate .
trade between Russia and Iran suddenly rises to 71 % - RT Business
with the lifting of sanctions , according to the Russian ambassador in Iran , Lev@@ an D@@ z@@ ha@@ gar@@ yan , the trade sum between Moscow and Te@@ hr@@ an increased by 7@@ 0.@@ 9 percent year @-@ on @-@ year .
since the international sanctions against Iran have been lifted , the interest in Russian companies in businesses in the country increased greatly , the ambassador said .
Russian companies are adop@@ ting existing ties with Iran , while new companies are ready to gain access to the market .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course , the further commercial expansion is one of the greatest priorities of the bilateral cooperation with Iran , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said D@@ z@@ ha@@ gar@@ yan . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he noted that the trade sum between Russia and Iran in the first five months of 2016 increased by 7@@ 0.@@ 9 percent compared to the same period in 2015 and was $ 8@@ 56 million .
in particular , Russian imports into Iran rose by 9@@ 1.5 percent , tot@@ alling $ 6@@ 97 million .
Russian imports from Iran rose by 16 percent to $ 158 million .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the trade boom was achieved by deliveries of machinery , agricultural vehicles and weapons , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the ambassador . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
D@@ z@@ ha@@ gar@@ yan goes from a record number of Iranian tourists to Russia this year .
last year , the Russian representation was around 35@@ ,000 Vis@@ as , primarily travel visa , to Iranian citizens .
in addition , Iran has reached the top 20 of the countries concerned with the number of tourists in Russia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one could say that the record figures of Iranian tourists in Russia were broken last year , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the same time , only relatively few Russians visit Iran , something of which the ambassador hopes that it will change .
&quot; I personally can recommend visiting the cities of Is@@ f@@ ah@@ an , Shi@@ ra@@ z and Y@@ az@@ d that have preserved the monuments of the ancient Persian civilization in a good state , &quot; he said .

Ha@@ ig@@ er@@ loch : pilgrimage to the gate of mercy
the ministers from the pastoral care unit E@@ yach@@ tal @-@ Ha@@ ig@@ er@@ loch St. Anna were on the way to Freiburg on a four @-@ day pilgrimage route from Vil@@ lingen to Freiburg .
together , four stages were dealt with .
in order to bridge the time to the next Roman@@ tic pilgrimage of all ministers in the course of two years , the round of the mini@@ stries of St. Anna has decided to prepare and carry out a multi @-@ day pilgrimage .
various pilgrimage destinations were examined and it was finally decided for the Bishop &apos;s City of Fri@@ bourg , where during this year &apos;s Holy Year of Mer@@ cy , a special pilgrimage was offered to the open gate of Mer@@ cy on Fri@@ bourg cathedral .
16 Min@@ is of B@@ itt@@ el@@ bron@@ n , and Gre@@ ol , and Ha@@ ig@@ er@@ loch , and Hei@@ ligen@@ stadt , went their way .
in the evening , pastor Stor@@ ost sent out the Pil@@ gri@@ ms in a small celebration in St. Anna , blessed the Pil@@ gri@@ mage and told the Pil@@ gri@@ ms .
from Hor@@ b it was driven by train to the starting point of Vil@@ lingen , where also a Münster University of Our Lady stands and so the pilgrimage route from Münster was started .
the individual day tours were framed in the morning and evening , accompanied by a short impulse with various prayers , songs and written texts .
but also on the way , the Min@@ is repeatedly made a rest at the field cross@@ ings , chap@@ els or churches to sing together a song from a specially assembled pilgri@@ m song booklet .
for the overnight stays the parish communities of the local par@@ ishes were available .
at the stage destinations Alexandra Burk@@ hardt and Hei@@ di F@@ aller took care of a tasty and tonic dinner and breakfast .
we continued on the second day via Fur@@ tw@@ angen to Gü@@ ten@@ bach .
the next day we stepped up the stage to St. Peter , which was the most exhau@@ sting stretch of road , but at first we had to overcome some 500 metres altitude and then climbed up again .
the deserved reward was a joint barbecue at the bath house in the evening .
after the morning impulse on the fourth pilgrimage day in the impressive monastery church of St. Peter we went to the final stage to Freiburg .
the Min@@ is also visi@@ bly reli@@ eved and happily arrived at the Freiburg Min@@ ster in the late afternoon and passed through the gates of mercy .
with a little impulse , God was given thanks .
at the evening Mass in Münster , the Min@@ is welcomed by Ko@@ operator Markus Ober@@ t were welcomed .
after the divine service , the pilgrims were able to visit the sac@@ rist@@ y and the high altar .
the next day was still time for the Brei@@ s@@ gau Met@@ ropolis .
in the afternoon we went back to Hor@@ b by train .
at the end , all participants agreed that the days of spirituality and a strong community experience were shaped .
Scot@@ s@@ man Call@@ um Sk@@ inner rush@@ es home when Br@@ ite won gold for cycling
Scottish Call@@ um Sk@@ inner ra@@ zed last night in the men &apos;s team @-@ spr@@ int in the Vel@@ od@@ rom in Rio for fame when the British team defended the title of London 2012 .
the 23 @-@ year @-@ old from Glas@@ gow took the anchor , which his comp@@ atri@@ ot Sir Chris Ho@@ y had made himself to E@@ igen . the J@@ unc@@ tion made the legend hau@@ ghty when he stor@@ med his home to collect a victory from the favor@@ ites of New Zealand .
England claimed a sho@@ cking victory four years ago , while Ho@@ y took the fifth of six Olympic med@@ als .
they repeated the trick after they got only a modest sixth place in March at the London Under@@ ground World Championships in London .
the problem between Beijing and London was the replacement of the driver Jamie staff .
they did this in good time as an exec@@ utor .
his retirement created a gap that Ki@@ an E@@ ma@@ di and Matt Cra@@ mp@@ ton tried to close .
Sk@@ inner was the man with whom they stayed as they saw potential in the sh@@ ot@@ ting that has now un@@ folded .
Hin@@ des , Kenn@@ y - four years ago with Ho@@ y won - and Sk@@ inner used an Olympic tournament in the qualification rounds , but in the standard rounds , the New Zealand won in the first round .
and the British trio won the du@@ el with gold .
after his lap he fell short , but Kenn@@ y brought the team forward and Sk@@ inner held it .
a change of strategy made a large part of the transformation , when Hin@@ des went in a higher gear to slow down it and allow Kenn@@ y and above all Sk@@ inner to keep the pace .
Ho@@ y watched from his position as BBC expert and fell on Sk@@ inner , Kenn@@ y and Hin@@ des when they got on the podium .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the 23 year old Sk@@ inner from Glas@@ gow said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s a fl@@ attering comparison . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I &apos;m just here to do my best and make a name for me .
we placed an Olympic @-@ ord in the final round and defeated the world champi@@ ons .
it was just unbelievable .
there is no better way to win this .
after the triumph in 2012 at the side Kenn@@ y and Ho@@ ys , Hin@@ der admitted that after a weak start he fell on the track deliberately .
he with@@ drew this statement later and there was no objection from England &apos;s ri@@ vals .
with such an outstanding victory this time there was no such problem .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; It feels like London with all the UK flags on the tri@@ b@@ une . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we have come together in the last three months as a team .
we did so badly with so many world titles that it was incredible to win again at the Olympics .
this is an event , a gold medal for the nation winning seven out of 10 titles both in Beijing and London .
if that is a bar@@ ometer of our progress in the last five months , we expect a successful five days in the Vel@@ od@@ rom .
with the form Kenn@@ y , it is in the realm of the possible that he repe@@ ats Ho@@ ys &apos;s victory of three Olympic gold med@@ als in a contest .
this would be for Kenn@@ y - exactly 12 years younger than Ho@@ y who was born on 23 March ( a seemingly sacred date for British sport ; on the day Steve Red@@ mond , Mo Far@@ ah and Roger Ban@@ ni@@ ster were born ) - a yield of six gold med@@ als and a silver medal .
this would be equal to that of Ho@@ y .
Kenn@@ y takes part in the spr@@ int now starting today and going for three days .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the 28 @-@ year @-@ old from Bol@@ ton said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I just enjoy this for the moment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the team event is always the best .
you can win it with your colleagues .
it feels a bit lonely to win alone .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; If he wins two gold med@@ als , he should be beaten to the k@@ night . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was the only medal competition of the day , but there were other good news for England .
Sir Bra@@ dly W@@ ig@@ gins , Ed C@@ lan@@ cy , Steven Bur@@ ke and O@@ wa@@ in Dou@@ ll qualified with the fastest performance in the four @-@ kilometer race .
they arrived in 3 : 5@@ 1,@@ 9@@ 42 .
the world record , which won Gold in 2012 in London , was at 3 : 5@@ 1,@@ 6@@ 59 .
the first and final round ( 22.@@ 42 ) will take place on the second day of the competition , where W@@ ig@@ gins will focus on safety .
he was cont@@ ested yesterday with officials before the qualification , when officials called him to measure his height .
in the appropriate women &apos;s competition , which will be continued and finished tomorrow , Laura Trot@@ t , Jo@@ anna R@@ ow@@ el S@@ hand , E@@ lin@@ or B@@ arker and K@@ atie Archi@@ bald of Mil@@ n@@ g@@ avi@@ e became world record time in 4 : 13,@@ 260 .
the UK team relies on its strong rail team to dominate the middle period of the Olympic Games and to pick up a crowd of med@@ als .
after a truly exceptional representation of absolute domin@@ ance in Beijing and London , the expectations for Rio were shut down .
in April , Dra@@ mas dropped off in the background , so Sh@@ ane S@@ ut@@ ton &apos;s technical director res@@ ig@@ ned in April amid sex@@ ism and mo@@ b@@ bing as well as the retirement of sizes such as Ho@@ y and Victoria Pend@@ let@@ on .
but if one looks at the first evening of the competition in the Vel@@ od@@ rom , it looks quite as if the now legendary reputation G@@ Bs , which has reached its peak at the perfect moment , will be repeated again .
the future of the sm@@ el@@ ting of Port@@ land as a result of the abolition of energy consumption
the future of the aluminium mel@@ ts of Port@@ land in Victoria - as well as hundreds of work@@ stations of workers - are at stake , as the plant operator termin@@ ates the energy supply contract and thereby elev@@ ates all supply contracts as the delivering energy company communic@@ ates .
this step followed the decision of the government in Victoria at the beginning of this year to grant no further subsidies to the operation of the plant .
a subsi@@ dy set for 20 years is underway in November .
up to 2,000 jobs in the Al@@ coa plant in Port@@ land are at stake .
not less than 2000 jobs -@@ direct as well as indirect - could be at risk in a closure .
in addition , it could come to dom@@ ino effects as the melting process consum@@ es around 10 percent of the total power generation of Victori@@ as .
in 2014 Al@@ coa closed the point Henry melt , leading to closure of the Angl@@ es@@ ea power plant last year .
Al@@ coa &apos;s sm@@ el@@ ting in Port@@ land loses money and risks a closure .
this step follows the years of speculation with regard to the future of the plant , originally as a result of the strong Australian dollar and last due to the electricity price for the plant .
AG@@ L , supplying the large aluminium mel@@ ei with its Lo@@ y Y@@ ang A power plant in Lat@@ robe Valley , announced that three other owners will announce their contracts .
the plant is owned by a joint venture between Al@@ coa and Al@@ um@@ ina , of which the Chinese company C@@ IT@@ IC and the Japanese Mar@@ u@@ ben@@ i Cor@@ p hold smaller portions .
&quot; AG@@ L assumes that the plant will continue to operate in Port@@ land , which means a further physical demand for electricity through the melt , &quot; said the company .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; AG@@ L continues to say that the contracts are so @-@ called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; security transactions &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which should come into force in November 2016 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the contracts have a 12 @-@ month notice period , so they will end in 2017 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , AG@@ L assumes that the contracts in the financial year 17 will contribute to revenues , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the electricity supplier . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
all potential impacts on the AG@@ L revenues from the G@@ J 18 are currently limited by the forecasts of strong fut@@ ures markets for wholesale electricity prices .
AG@@ L announced that it had already written down the value of the contracts in its annual subscription amounting to $ 18@@ 7 million in &quot; anticip@@ ation of cancellation . &quot;
Al@@ coa said that the decision to book the Tre@@ aties , the &quot; Ab@@ ility of Al@@ co@@ as &quot; ... to operate the melt or to ensure the power supply to the melt &quot; does not interfere .
the U.S. company said that 2010 has concluded a 20 @-@ year contract with Lo@@ y Y@@ ang , which should have entered into force from November this year , even if there is still another explanation why it res@@ ig@@ ned from the contract .
analysts warn of the poor economic conditions of the industry prior to the possible closure of the Port@@ land melting facility in Victoria and the Tom@@ ago plant near New@@ castle .
in reference to analysts &apos; statements at the beginning of the week , the Head of Operations Stephen Mik@@ kel@@ sen said Port@@ land use around 600 MW and Tom@@ ago to consume about 900 meg@@ a@@ watts of electricity per year .
if both plants disappear from the market , this would mean a significant reduction in demand on the &#91; electricity market &#93; .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and for us as a generating set it would not be good , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
more than just a Kar@@ das@@ hy@@ an reality TV star , K@@ end@@ all is on the cover of the September edition of Vo@@ gue
K@@ end@@ all Jen@@ ner , 20 , Model and fourth daughter of the manager and mother of the Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ an Jen@@ ner clan , Kris is on the cover of the cov@@ eted September edition of the U.S. Vo@@ gue .
K@@ end@@ all , the brand ambassador of Est@@ ee Lau@@ der , and on the Fashion We@@ eks in Milan , Paris and New York , announced on Thursday the news on her Inst@@ agra@@ m account .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a room full of people I love , the sight of this cover made me cry , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; K@@ end@@ all wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the cover of the cover followed a bizarre ( or simply keeping Up with the Kar@@ das@@ hy@@ ans similar ? ) , craw@@ ling reality video showing the entire Kar@@ das@@ hy@@ an Jen@@ ner family ( with the exception of the problem cases Ro@@ b and Ca@@ it@@ ly@@ n ) as well as in the presence of the most popular show bi@@ z unc@@ le and producers of keeping Up Ry@@ an Se@@ ac@@ rest ) , which ends with a classical twist : they all have planned a surprise party .
this is the stere@@ otyp@@ ed plot of almost every birthday sep@@ t@@ ode for a children &apos;s show ( Se@@ ac@@ rest brought the sentence , &quot; You thought we had forgotten you ? , &quot; with the hon@@ esty of a cartoon on a slot at 8 o &apos;clock in the morning ) , but Kris had to let her other girls take part in this publicity .
with regard to the September issue of the Vo@@ gue a new era of carto@@ graphy has certainly begun .
K@@ end@@ all &apos;s big sister Kim might have beaten her regarding the Vo@@ gue cover ( she and her husband K@@ any@@ e West were on it in April 2014 ) , but the cover of the September issue of the magazine is a league for itself .
the September edition is the most sold edition of the year for Vo@@ gue .
with a circum@@ ference resem@@ bling an image band as a fashion magazine , the output draws a large number of advertis@@ ers ( aut Fas@@ hi@@ on@@ ist@@ a were from the 8@@ 32 pages of the ram@@ disk 6@@ 15 pages advertisement ) .
the un@@ v@@ eiling of his cover star is so eag@@ erly awa@@ ited that in the last two years , pictures of the magazine le@@ aked before the official announcement .
women who were already on the cover include Na@@ omi Camp@@ bell , Linda Evangel@@ ist@@ a and K@@ ate Mos@@ s .
in recent years there have been more &quot; celeb@@ ri@@ ties who mock &quot; as &quot; models , the celeb@@ ri@@ ties are &quot; on the cover .
Oscar winner and Di@@ or brand ambassador J@@ enni@@ fer Lawrence was on the cover in 2013 , one year after Lady G@@ aga had the honour .
but even with the little chance that Mrs. Jen@@ ner - who is described by the magazine as the &quot; breakthrough model &quot; of her generation - falls below the earlier category , she is in good company .
these celeb@@ ri@@ ties are not related to famous people or reality stars or young@@ sters of today who know how to turn a good Snap@@ chat video ( even though everything applies to Jen@@ ner ) .
they are really talented women who are in the entertainment industry .
Be@@ y@@ once , who appeared on the last cover , had one of the most successful years of her career with the release of Lem@@ on@@ ade .
of course J@@ enn@@ ers &apos; success doesn &apos;t like everyone .
with her reality TV history J@@ enn@@ ers &apos;s position in the world of fashion was always a bit ten@@ se .
in June , the former Victoria &apos;s Secret model Steph@@ anie Se@@ ym@@ our Jen@@ ner and her colleague Gig@@ i Ha@@ did critici@@ zed them and called them &quot; the Mist@@ resses of the Eye . &quot;
these feelings cook up again when the news came out with the appearance of J@@ enn@@ ers on the Vo@@ gue Cover .
but lying around on the mis@@ m seems to pass by the point .
K@@ end@@ all Jen@@ ner is on the cover of the September edition of Vo@@ gue .
it is a super@@ model in the tru@@ est sense of the word .
she runs for Marc Jac@@ obs .
it makes advertising for your pri@@ mer of Est@@ ee Lau@@ der .
you and all your sisters sell pictures of themselves on their respective pay@@ wall apps .
she sells her own pictures of C@@ ind@@ y Cra@@ w@@ for@@ ds &apos;s daughter to the magazine LOVE .
and in her free time she is seen in Reality TV . probably just to see her sister K@@ our@@ t@@ ney and her children .
community centers assign 160@@ ,000 people per year
more than 160@@ ,000 of the country &apos;s emergency needs are rejected annually by the Municipal Centr@@ es , while the industry is preparing for the effects of further mi@@ tigation on over@@ bur@@ dened transactions .
in Que@@ ens@@ land , three out of five people - mostly older people , immigrants , needy workers , victims of violence and those who have no means of un@@ just del@@ u@@ sions and similar - are rejected in their search for free legal advice and legal assistance .
legal services of the municipality , which are already over@@ booked , are ready for further cuts .
from June next year , it is planned that these legal centres will lose another 30 percent of their federal funds .
the director of the Que@@ es@@ land James Far@@ rel@@ l National Co@@ unc@@ ils said that the last survey of the National Association of Common Market Centr@@ es revealed that thousands of people are rejected every year .
Far@@ rel@@ l said that the situation would be even worse without repe@@ aling the decision of the German government .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Que@@ ens@@ land &apos;s community centers are chron@@ ically under@@ financed , which means that thousands of people from important services you need are rejected , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
people who leave violent relations , people with insur@@ moun@@ table and oppres@@ sive debts , families who have been dismissed by separ@@ ations , workers who have been un@@ just@@ ly dismissed - all these people have problems of legal nature and this survey shows that they cannot get the help they need .
the Federal Government will cut the funding by 30 percent as of June 2017 , which means that thousands of people in need of help from Que@@ ens@@ land will be forced to cope with their legal problems without any help .
we call on the General At@@ tor@@ ney General and Justice Minister and Sen@@ ators of Que@@ ens@@ land George Bran@@ dis to immediately raise these funds so that people can get the help they need in case of legal problems .
last year , the State Government fulfilled its commitment to raise funds for guidance on the national average .
it is now time to look at the needs of the community centers and their customers , and that the government of Pal@@ as@@ z@@ c@@ zu@@ k inv@@ ests in this important work .
Donald Tr@@ ump election campaign indic@@ ted after workers allegedly drew gun
new York : Donald Tr@@ um@@ ps campaign was indic@@ ted for alleged in@@ action when it was told that its campaign manager for North Carolina had a gun aimed at a staff while on the move in February in a je@@ ep .
the incident is described in a bill of indictment , which was submitted to Charlotte by Vincent B@@ ordin@@ i on Wednesday in the State Court of Charlotte , a former software programmer for the campaign in this state .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; B@@ ordin@@ i stated to have waited months for the matter to be settled internally before he realized that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that would not happen . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the campaign leader , Ear@@ l Philip , &quot; pulled a gun , put his right hand finger on the trigger and ra@@ mm@@ ed the barrel in Vinc@@ ents Kni@@ ek@@ eh@@ le , &quot; gave B@@ ordin@@ i in his indictment .
having compl@@ ained to the local and regional campaign management , B@@ ordin@@ i stated that at least four other people had the same experience with Phil@@ lip , he claimed in the indictment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; weapons must not be fired to cause harm , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; B@@ ordin@@ i added . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the accus@@ ation comes only two days after the Republi@@ can presidential candidate triggered a rebellion when he said a crowd in North Carolina said that the &quot; Second A@@ mend@@ ment People &quot; - fire@@ arms owners and arms lovers - should take action if his rival H@@ illary Clinton was elected and judge should appoint .
Tr@@ um@@ ps &apos;s campaign made it clear that the media would have torn his words out of context and that he would not be offen@@ ded by violence .
ordinary complaint requires damages from the campaign for violation of duty of care and Philip due to bodily injury and permanent mental damage .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Tr@@ um@@ ps Press Officer Hope Hi@@ cks was not to be reached for an opinion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
attempts to contact Philip also failed .
W@@ C@@ CB , a local news channel in Charlotte , reports that Phil@@ lip is no longer a member of the campaign .
responding to calls from his consulting company , Innov@@ ative Consulting Services , has not been re@@ acted .
the Republi@@ can presidential candidate Donald Tr@@ ump has so far managed a controversial campaign .

Berlin / Schwer@@ in : survey before country elections : losing the SPD and the CD@@ U
in the upcoming elections in the federal states of Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern ( September 4 ) and Berlin ( September 18 ) considerable losses for the governing party SPD and CD@@ U are notable .
this resulted in representative surveys from the In@@ sa opinion research institute for the Bild @-@ Zeitung ( Friday ) .
while the red @-@ black government coalition could continue to go@@ vern in the north , this is not possible after the survey values in Berlin .
in both federal states , the SPD would be the strongest party and would have good chances of continuing to face the head of government .
in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern the SPD fell from 3@@ 5.@@ 6 percent five years ago to 24 percent .
according to the survey , the party was only smiling just ahead of the CD@@ U , which could return to 23 percent again .
the third place is disputed between the left and the Af@@ D .
the left would be 19 percent ( before 18.@@ 4 percent ) , the Af@@ D would represent 19 percent for the first time in the Land@@ tag .
despite a slight loss of 6 per cent ( previous 8.@@ 7 per cent ) , the Gre@@ ens moved back to Schwer@@ in Land@@ tag .
N@@ PD and F@@ DP would not be represented in the Land@@ tag with 3 per cent respectively .
according to the survey , the SPD of the Berlin Chamber of Dep@@ u@@ ties would only return to 23 per cent ( election 2011 : 28.@@ 3 percent ) .
the CD@@ U only reached 18 percent after 23.@@ 4 percent .
they thus still lie behind the Gre@@ ens with 19 percent ( 2011 : 17.@@ 6 percent ) , but before the left with 15 percent ( previously 11.@@ 7 percent ) .
the Af@@ D would represent 14 percent for the first time in the House of Repres@@ ent@@ atives .
with 5 percent , the F@@ DP could hope for a return , but the pirates would not be missing in contrast to 2011 .
Nokia 9000 Communic@@ ator : the first smartphone
e @-@ Mail and Internet in slow motion : 20 years ago the Nokia Communic@@ ator came to the market .
the success@@ ors dominate the world today - its manufacturer experienced a disaster .
the tool weighed almost half a kil@@ ogram and was more than four times as heavy as an iPhone 5 .
it was thicker and bigger , therefore it was not good in the hand .
on the contrary , it was rather bul@@ ky .
the built @-@ in memory was initially eight meg@@ ab@@ ytes , which would be a high resolution for about two sel@@ fies today .
an iPhone is now supplied with at least 16 gi@@ gab@@ ytes .
the Nokia 9000 Communic@@ ator came to business exactly 20 years ago , on August 15th , 1996 - and it was the first smartphone .
for a few euros , fans can still buy the devices on the Internet , but they somehow come from the Stone Age of the internet era .
20 years ago , however , the communic@@ ator was a sensation .
the Finnish mobile phone manufacturer announced the product a few months earlier at the computer fair C@@ eb@@ it in Hanover as &quot; office in western pocket format . &quot;
in fact , the new mobile phone could be sent and received for then standards : SMS and emails could be sent and received , even by fax the communic@@ ator was to be reached .
even the access to web pages was possible via HTML @-@ Browser , albeit qu@@ el@@ ly slow .
a calcul@@ ator was available , a digital address book and an electronic calendar .
there was a small antenna , and the mobile phone could be folded like a laptop .
then we found a small keyboard and a black @-@ and @-@ white screen .
quite proud was the price : 27@@ 00 D @-@ Mark , i.e. about 1400 Euros .
the average selling price of a smartphone in Germany was 3@@ 92 euros in 2015 .
no one could suspect in August 1996 that the communic@@ ator would become the beginning of the smartphone era .
since then everything is different .
smart phones are a success story , even if not for Nokia .
Finn@@ s &apos;s mobile phone division experienced an unprecedented disaster , eventually sold and handled to Microsoft .
the market today dominate providers who all came a lot later than Nokia .
ever and everywhere , this is everyday life for a lot of people .
in 2015 , there were nearly two billion smart phones worldwide .
about 1.4 billion units sold , Samsung and Apple accounted for 5@@ 55 million units of this alone .
worldwide sales are around 400 billion euros .
this includes the well @-@ running business of the countless app providers and telecommunications companies .
a whole industry has now emerged around the smartphone .
the decisive breakthrough to the mass market was only beginning at the beginning of 2007 , at that time Apple CEO Steve Jobs announced the launch of the i@@ Ph@@ ones on the Mac World .
he promised three devices in one : a music player , a telephone and an internet communic@@ ator , all via touch screen easy to use .
Apple &apos;s triumph@@ al march began , and today the iPhone is the company &apos;s most important product .
Nokia , Motor@@ ola and Black@@ berry , who ruled the market , had a look .
they eventually disappeared , Black@@ berry has to fight .
the Sa@@ ys now have Apple and Asian providers like Samsung .
the smartphone is a matter of course for 20 years after its invention .
today every German looks back on his mobile phone 88 times a day .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we all need to learn to get the Smartphone away , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Jan@@ ina Ball , responsible for personnel in the Siemens Management Board . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
permanent availability is now considered a curse and blessing at the same time .
England must direct the Olympic spirit and bro@@ aden He@@ ath@@ row
He@@ ath@@ row will bring renewal and prosperity not only in our local communities and throughout London , but throughout the country .
for me it was the biggest attraction of He@@ ath@@ rows , just like at that time in 2012 in London , when we had a great effort to make sure all our nations and regions benefited from the games .
the Olympics brought great benefits to Str@@ at@@ ford and the East End .
and that will be achieved by creating new opportunities for local residents and companies near He@@ ath@@ row .
we will create 10,000 new jobs for our local communities alone , create 40,000 new jobs and put an end to youth unemployment in the airport .
as they were ahead of us in London 2012 , there will be those who will think that the challenge of expanding He@@ ath@@ row is too great .
I was told that England will never be ready for the games and that we will be blin@@ king on the world stage .
the doubts were wrong in 2012 and they will also be wrong with He@@ ath@@ row .
there are always obstacles to overcoming , but He@@ ath@@ row answers any question asked .
like the Olympic Games , He@@ ath@@ row is for many and not for individual an infrastructure project .
enlargement is a way to create up to 180@@ ,000 new jobs , £ 211 billion in funny growth and to leave a legacy of skills and jobs both at the airport and in the UK .
we have a great team in He@@ ath@@ row , which has implemented a £ 11 billion expensive infrastructure investment program in time and budget from the T@@ 5 - the five years in a row to the world &apos;s best airport terminal , up to the T2 , which was built in the middle of the two most frequ@@ ented walk@@ ways in the world .
now they are ready to deliver a third cat@@ walk , which is supported by £ 16 billion invested in private investment .
the London Games of 2012 were a great success for GB and I am confident that He@@ ath@@ row &apos;s expansion will also be one .
it is time for us to direct this Olymp@@ ian spirit and bro@@ aden He@@ ath@@ row as well as to secure our future trade and create a legacy of skills and jobs that England can be proud of .

Ad@@ block Plus , Facebook in the &quot; K@@ atz and M@@ ouse game &quot; regarding ad blocking
for companies that earn money with online advertising , try to circum@@ vent ad blocking according to one of the software vendors , a &quot; cat and mouse game . &quot;
on Thursday , just two days after Facebook announced that ad lock@@ ings were blocked on its desktop page , Ad@@ block Plus published a blog post in which users could update their filters in the program to block ads on the social network again .
on Tuesday , Facebook announced that its desktop site would change the coding for its adver@@ ts to make it more difficult to detect what part of the site advertising is .
but Ad@@ block announced that it has found a new way to b@@ ypass the new codes .
in a blog post , the spokes@@ man of Ad@@ block Ben Williams wrote that &quot; this kind of H@@ in @-@ and @-@ Her struggle is underway between the opening open source community and the conver@@ ters since the invention of display lock@@ ers , &quot; and that it is possible that Facebook soon comes with a new solution .
the fact that the world &apos;s largest social media company has entered the fight is a strong indication of how alar@@ ming display lock@@ ers for the industry have become .
according to a study published last year by Pa@@ gef@@ air and Adobe around 200 million people worldwide use display lock@@ ers ; nearly four times as much in 2013 .
with 1.@@ 03 billion daily active users accessing Facebook across their mobile devices , mobile advertising accounts for 84 percent of advertising revenues .
apart from the fact that mobile ad blo@@ cker has no effect on Facebook &apos;s mobile app for the social network and Inst@@ agra@@ m , the company announced that it has no effect on the social network and Inst@@ agra@@ m .
advertising on the desktop PC accounts for a sufficient amount of income so Facebook appears to be worthwhile for the investment of such a step .
on Tuesday , Facebook announced that it would update its &quot; Ad Pre@@ ference Tool &quot; to give people more control over their targeted advertising .
on Thursday Facebook claimed that new filters would be wor@@ rying new filters because they would block content on the site that are not advertising .
&quot; this is not a positive experience for users , so we plan to address the problem , &quot; a Facebook Spo@@ kes@@ person told us in an email message .
ad block@@ ers are a bl@@ unt tool , which is why we have concentrated on developing tools such as Ad Pre@@ ferences to put more control into the hands of people .
woman suspected of comm@@ itting suicide on the Swiss motorway
the victim was lying in the middle of the night on the highway .
the police call on witnesses after a woman was convic@@ ted of several vehicles on a highway in the early morning hours on Thursday .
the incident occurred on the A1 near Morges in the canton of Vau@@ d shortly after midnight .
a woman lay down in the dark &quot; in an act of desper@@ ation &quot; on the street and were hit by several cars , the police said in Vau@@ d .
it is obvious that a Swiss woman at the age of 49 , who was convic@@ ted of several vehicles , including a truck , wanted to kill himself .
she died on the spot .
several drivers have already been heard , but some have still not been identified , the police said that they , as well as every witness of the incident , told them to report .
an investigation procedure was opened , which is a logical step in such a situation , distributed G@@ illes Hof@@ st@@ etter to Le Tri@@ b@@ une de Gen@@ eve .
however , it remains to be seen whether any of the drivers will be displayed .
was a collision avoid@@ able ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is something the prosec@@ utor must decide , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Hof@@ st@@ etter . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; two similar cases over the last five years show that drivers are not held accoun@@ table . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in each of the two cases - where a person ran in the dark on the highway - it was decided that drivers do not have to assume that a pedestrian runs in the middle of the night on the highway as it was called in the newspaper .
last year , a police officer was acqu@@ itted after having crossed and killed a man who was lying on the A1 near Pay@@ erne in August 2014 .
the 22 @-@ year @-@ old victim had drunk and had become unconscious in the street , took the court .
the Court found that the polic@@ ew@@ oman had responded to an emergency call -- to a justified way , and that the presence of a man on the street was a &quot; completely unusual and unfor@@ es@@ eeable situation , &quot; said the judge .
anyone who has further information about the incident on Thursday near Morges should contact the police under number 0@@ 21 6@@ 44 83 46 or 0@@ 21 6@@ 44 44 44 .

according to projections of a new NASA climate model , Venus probably was once inhab@@ itable .
scientists at the Go@@ dd@@ ard Institute for Space Studies from NASA developed a model to explore the past of Venus based on tools and algorithms that resem@@ ble those of climate scientists .
the model was designed to determine whether Venus could have rejected similar conditions with its hot , water@@ less surface and CO2 @-@ dense atmosphere .
scientists have previously indicated that the slow rotation of Venus could be explained by its dense atmosphere .
but the most recent simulation indicates that Venus could have had a thin , er@@ d@@ like atmosphere and slowly rot@@ ated .
the model also illuminated the top@@ ography of the early Venus .
the planet probably showed more dry areas than the Earth , but once had enough water and geographical vari@@ ability to accommodate lives and protected against fast evap@@ oration .
the early Venus also benefited from a Sun that was 30 percent weaker .
&quot; in the G@@ ISS model simulation , the slow rotation of Venus asser@@ ts its day @-@ side of the sun for almost two months , &quot; says G@@ ISS scientist Anthony Del Gen@@ io in a press release .
this war@@ ms the surface and produces rain that creates a thick layer of clouds which acts like an umbrella to shield the surface from much of the solar heat .
the results are average temperatures , which are some degrees cooler than that of the Earth today .
the model produced a history of Venus , similar to evolution that had previously been suspected by planet researchers .
although it was probably inhab@@ itable , Venus was exposed to too much heat and ultra@@ violet light in the course of several billions of years .
their oceans evapor@@ ated and their water vap@@ or was burned away by ultra@@ violet light .
as their Hydro@@ gen with@@ drew only a thick atmosphere of carbon dioxide returned with a deadly greenhouse effect -- the Venus , which as we know it today .
the researchers shared the results of their new Venus climate model in the Ge@@ ophysi@@ cal Research Let@@ ters .
Patrick Roy re@@ acts as a Train@@ ee of A@@ val@@ an@@ che
Patrick Roy came back on Thursday as a trainer and vice president Of Ho@@ ckey Operations of the Colorado A@@ val@@ an@@ che and led to a minor role determination in the decision @-@ making process of the team .
alternatively , President / General Manager of the Color@@ ados Joe Sak@@ ic confirmed this decision and noted that the association will immediately look for a new trainer .
&quot; over the past three years , I have fulfilled my duties as head coach and Vice President Of Ho@@ ckey Operations of the Colorado A@@ val@@ an@@ che with energy , passion and determination , &quot; said the 50 @-@ year @-@ old Roy in an opinion .
during the summer I have been thinking about how I could improve this team to give it more depth , that it needs and bring it to a higher level .
in order to achieve this , the Vision of the Train@@ ers and Vice President Of Ho@@ ckey Operations has to be perfectly matched to the organization .
he must also have a right of co @-@ determination in decisions that affect the performance of the team .
these conditions are not met at the moment .
Sak@@ ic , who had hired Roy on 23 May 2013 , thank@@ ed him for his contributions to the team .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Patrick informed me today about this decision , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Sak@@ ic . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we all appreciate what he has done for our organisation and wish him the best for the future .
during his debut season Roy has won the A@@ val@@ an@@ ches 2013 @-@ 14 as the winner of the Jack Adams Award as the best trainer of the league .
he led the club to 112 points and first place in Central Vision , but Colorado was defeated in the first round of the Pla@@ yo@@ ffs of Minn@@ es@@ ota and missed the late season in each of the last two years .
the A@@ val@@ an@@ ches recorded a 39 @-@ 39 @-@ 4 brand during the 2015 @-@ 16 season and fell five points behind the Wild for a second wild@@ card spot at the Western Conference .
as Hall of F@@ ame Tor@@ wart , Roy has won four Stan@@ ley C@@ ups -- two pieces with the Montreal Can@@ adi@@ ens and the A@@ val@@ an@@ che .
North des@@ ee@@ pers resume talks , strike out strikes
the fight against the remuneration for the North Sea workers will be suspended while all the parties sit on the table for a new round of talks , said negoti@@ ators .
strikes against the Wood @-@ Field Service provider Wood Group have been carried out spor@@ adi@@ cally on platforms in the North Sea operated by Royal Dutch Shell .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wood Group as well as the Un@@ ite and R@@ MT trade unions can confirm that we have agreed to restart the process of the current dispute , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it says in a common statement . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we will stop some day @-@ to @-@ day sessions in the coming weeks , starting next year to restart the problems .
the unions said that their last strike , which is the first in over 25 years , is a protest against possible wage cuts of up to 30 percent .
this year , Wood Group has shortened the rates to its tractors in the North Sea by around 9 percent due to negative market pressures .
the company &apos;s down@@ turn follows a 10 percent decline for on@@ shore customers in 2014 .
the company said that additional cuts give the company the necessary space to come through the market down@@ turn .
shell has released for its part thousands of people and plans to give up its oil and gas business activities in up to 10 countries as it stream@@ lines its business activities as a result of its mega joint venture with the British energy company BG Group .
energy companies are under pressure due to lower crude oil prices , an economic situation driven by the decision of the British in June to leave the European Union .
at the beginning of this week , the Scottish parliament , Dave Anderson , met with workers &quot; leaders to discuss one of the greatest labour disputes which took place since a generation in the North Sea .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the North Sea is important for regional economy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the North Sea and across the country , we need an economy that works for many and not just for few , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in a statement . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 2016 , less than $ 1.4 billion in spending on new projects in the North Sea is expected to grow at an average of around $ 7 billion in the last five years .
Ke@@ pler measures the rotation rate of stars in the cluster of the ple@@ j@@ ades
the latest mission with the Ke@@ pler Wel@@ Space Teles@@ cope has helped astronom@@ ers to collect the most complete catalogue of rot@@ ational rates among the stars of the con@@ stellation of the P@@ lei@@ ades .
the new data will help the astronom@@ ers understand why stars in the star @-@ pile rotate to different rates , as well as in what context rot@@ ational periods are associated with planetary origin .
&quot; we hope that by comparing our results with other stars , we will learn more about the relationship between the mass of a star , its age and even the history of its solar system , &quot; said Lu@@ isa Reb@@ ull , a researcher at Cal@@ tech &apos;s Infr@@ ared Processing and Analysis Center in Pas@@ ad@@ ena , in a press release .
the cluster of the P@@ lei@@ ades lies 4@@ 45 light@@ years distant from the Earth .
many stars in this cluster of stars , which originated some 125 million years ago , now reach adul@@ thood .
they are now turning the fastest .
at peak rot@@ ational rates these ri@@ pen@@ ing stars b@@ ump large amounts of star winds .
since these winds travel through the magnetic fields of the stars , they have a braking effect on the stars .
when a star age , its rotation rate begins to slow down .
Ke@@ pler measures the rotation rate of each star by recogni@@ zing the time between the appearance of a recognizable star spot -- such as sun@@ spots .
the latest catalogue of rot@@ ational rates indicates that more massive stars turn slower than less massive stars .
Reb@@ ull compar@@ es stars with dancers , whereas larger stars turn slower pi@@ rou@@ ettes than smaller ones .
&quot; in the &quot; Ballet &quot; of the P@@ lei@@ ades we see that slow rot@@ ors tend to be massive whereas faster rot@@ ors tend to be very bright stars , &quot; Reb@@ ull said .
since the cluster of the P@@ lei@@ ades is so close , it serves as an ideal cosmic laboratory to compare stell@@ ar qualities such as rot@@ ational rates .
&quot; the cluster of the P@@ lei@@ ades provides an anchor for theoretical models of stell@@ ar rotation in both directions , younger and older , &quot; Reb@@ ull said .
there is still much ahead of us what we would like to learn more about how , when and why stars slow down their rot@@ ational rates , and so to speak , hang up their &quot; dance shoes . &quot;
Reb@@ ull and her colleagues reported in detail about their latest analysis of the rot@@ ational rates of the P@@ lei@@ ades , which will soon be published in the Astronom@@ ical Journal .
a controversial bas@@ eb@@ all star ki@@ cks off
the tears ran faster with Alex Rodri@@ gu@@ ez than the US bas@@ eb@@ all star in best days from base to base .
after his emotional withdrawal announcement , the 41 @-@ year @-@ old pro will wear the jer@@ sey of his New York Yan@@ ke@@ es last time on August 12 against the T@@ amp@@ a Bay Ra@@ ys .
&quot; I love this game and this team . &quot;
&quot; I say good@@ bye to Goo@@ db@@ ye , &quot; stated the 14 @-@ time All @-@ Star Game participants of the Major League Bas@@ eb@@ all ( ML@@ B ) .
three times Rodri@@ gu@@ ez was elected the most valuable player in the league , in 2009 he won the World Series with Yan@@ ke@@ es .
his signature under a ten @-@ year contract brought him 27 million US dollars a year since 2007 .
until the end of the contract on 31 December 2017 , he will serve as a consultant and a youth coach - with a full salary .
as a player , Rodri@@ gu@@ ez paid for a long time with performance .
with 6@@ 96 Hom@@ er , 3@@ 114 hits and 2021 points for his teams ( &quot; R@@ uns &quot; ) for the Seattle Marin@@ ers ( 1994 to 2000 ) , the Texas R@@ angers ( 2001 to 2004 ) and since 2005 the Yan@@ ke@@ es made some mil@@ estones .
with Hall @-@ of @-@ F@@ ame members H@@ ank Aaron and Wil@@ lie Ma@@ ys , only two other bas@@ eb@@ all players have similar values in the most important statistics .
however , the 41 @-@ year @-@ old should not be admitted into the hall of silence of the bas@@ eb@@ alls .
for so successful Rodri@@ gu@@ ez - nick@@ name &quot; A @-@ R@@ od &quot; - was in the field so controversial is his appearance outside the place .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in 2009 the super@@ star &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ES@@ PN &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; admitted to having taken forbidden ster@@ oids from 2001 to 2003 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in August 2013 , he was banned for 211 games by the end of 2014 due to a involvement in the so @-@ called Bio@@ gen@@ esis sc@@ andal .
Rodri@@ gu@@ ez is considered the prime suspect to have received funding for years on an anti @-@ aging clinic in South Florida .
after a law@@ suit , the lock was still reduced to 162 meetings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the league may have done me a favour for 2014 , because I &apos;ve played through 20 years without a break , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said at that time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
even his farewell @-@ days are not no@@ is@@ eless .
while many bas@@ eb@@ all legends get the big stage in their last games , Rodri@@ gu@@ ez often had to sit on the bench .
&quot; my job does not include a farewell tour . &quot;
&quot; my job involves trying to win any game , &quot; estimated Yan@@ ke@@ es coach Joe Gir@@ ardi .
after all , Rodri@@ gu@@ ez , who was married to the act@@ ress Cameron Di@@ az and re @-@ told the relationship with pop star Madonna and act@@ ress K@@ ate Hudson , got sympathy with fans of the Yan@@ ke@@ e Arch@@ riv@@ ale Boston Red So@@ x .
&quot; we want A @-@ R@@ od , &quot; the followers sang at 4 : 9 defeat against the Rodri@@ gu@@ ez team .
Olympics 2016 : chen X@@ in@@ yi , Sil@@ wi@@ a Dan@@ ek@@ ova and Adrian Severin Ziel@@ inski are the first dop@@ ing cases
caught : because of a positive dop@@ ing test , Wei@@ ght@@ lif@@ ter Adrian Severin Ziel@@ inski is not allowed to start from Poland in Rio .
Rio de Janeiro - The 2016 Olympic Games are over@@ shad@@ owed by the first official dop@@ ing cases .
a well @-@ known ath@@ lete would have won almost a medal .
before the seventh race day , the first official dop@@ ing cases have become known as the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro .
the Chinese float in Ch@@ en X@@ in@@ yi , 3000 @-@ metre barrier @-@ runner in Sil@@ wi@@ a Dan@@ ek@@ ova from Bulgaria and Polish wei@@ ght@@ lif@@ ter Adrian Severin Ziel@@ inski were positively tested in Brazil and excluded - immediately before the start of the athle@@ tics competitions that are critical of the competition , these news come to nau@@ ght .
in Ch@@ en last Sunday the di@@ ure@@ tic hydro@@ chlor@@ o@@ thi@@ azi@@ de was detected , which is used as a mas@@ king agent for dop@@ ing substances .
the International Sport Court ( CA@@ S ) confirmed their expul@@ sion from the Olympic Games on Friday afternoon .
on Sunday the 18 @-@ year @-@ old took fourth place in the final over 100 m of butter@@ flies , only about 0.@@ 09 seconds she missed the bronze medal .
on Friday Ch@@ en would have had to take part in the events of more than 50 m Fre@@ estyle .
the International Olympic Committee ( IO@@ C ) requested the opening of the B @-@ rehear@@ sal and a hearing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the national association takes the matter &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; very seriously and demands full cooperation in the investigations , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; X@@ in@@ hua quoted from a message : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will work with the International Sport Court CA@@ S and will accept the verdict . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for the first time in history , the IO@@ C is no longer responsible for the sanc@@ tioning of athletes with positive cases .
also in the night of Rio the news spread over the positive rehear@@ sal at Dan@@ ek@@ ova , the 33 @-@ year @-@ old went on to the offensive .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I had three tests , all negative , and my fourth test was positive , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was an incredible shock , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she told the Bulgarian TV channel B@@ NT . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she is innocent , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the only explanation could be food supplements , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the ath@@ lete . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to the report , the banned substances are to act as EP@@ O blood dop@@ ing agents .
Dan@@ ek@@ ova has been suspended for the time being , according to B@@ NT , the B @-@ sample has already been positive .
Bulgaria &apos;s Prime Minister Boy@@ ko Bor@@ is@@ so@@ v immediately informed himself with criticism of the ath@@ lete .
&quot; I don &apos;t understand why athletes don &apos;t draw the right conclusions , &quot; he said : &quot; we Bulg@@ arians are under observation , so many have already been excluded . &quot;
for example , all wei@@ ght@@ lif@@ ters from the chron@@ ically dop@@ ing nation are not allowed to take part in Rio .
on Friday the case of &quot; Adrian Per@@ inski , &quot; the London Olympic Champion in the class up to 85 kg , was tested positively on the an@@ abolic ster@@ oid N@@ and@@ ro@@ lon three days before .
both are not allowed to start taking , though they are not allowed to start in the class up to 94 kg .
before the start of the athletes , especially the case Dan@@ ek@@ ova is another heavy blow to the reputation of the entire sport .
the IA@@ AF World Association had banned the entire Russian team up to one exception because of systematic dop@@ ing , even the nation @-@ nation Kenya produces numerous bad news in Rio .
in the swimming sport , the earlier off@@ ences in China also ensured fierce disputes between the athletes .
the Fren@@ ch@@ man Cam@@ ille Lac@@ our@@ t attacked the Chinese Olympic Champion Sun Y@@ ang har@@ sh@@ ly .
&quot; sun Y@@ ang p@@ ink@@ elt purple . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when I see the podium above 200 m Fre@@ estyle , I want to hand over , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Lac@@ our@@ t in the French radio . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
sun was also the focus of a confrontation with the Australian M@@ ack Hor@@ ton .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have no time and no respect for dop@@ ing fraud , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
sun was tested positively on the stimul@@ ant Tri@@ met@@ azi@@ din in 2014 for the Chinese nationals , but only had to reti@@ re for a three month lock .
data theft : so per@@ fi@@ de black@@ mail her ran@@ som
program@@ mers of black@@ mail malware are currently target@@ ing companies - and are successful .
according to a recent survey by the malware protection specialists Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ ytes under 540 companies in North America , Great Britain and Germany , 40 percent of the surv@@ eyed companies in the past twelve months have been at least once , sometimes multiple victims of an attack with black@@ mail software .
in Germany , almost 20 percent of the companies were already the target of a ran@@ som@@ ware black@@ mail .
40 percent of the victims willingly paid the ran@@ som required by the perpetr@@ ators in order to be able to use the challenged systems and data again .
the perpetr@@ ators speci@@ alize their black@@ mail software according to the observations of Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ ytes as a result of attacks in company networks .
if they are successful there , the potential to be black@@ out ran@@ som is considerably higher than for private users .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are currently watching a frigh@@ tening rapid evolution of malware , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ ytes leader Mar@@ cin Kl@@ ec@@ zy@@ n@@ ski talking to the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; world . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 2008 , most of the Mal@@ war@@ e@@ programs were still designed to send advertising .
then the perpetr@@ ators discovered black@@ mail software for themselves .
only private users were the target , but the change to company att@@ aches took place in recent months terri@@ bly fast .
Ran@@ som@@ ware works according to a simple pattern : once on the computer of a victim , it searches for recently changed files such as Word@@ - , Excel or database files as well as archives of images and videos .
these files encryp@@ t the ran@@ som@@ ware and er@@ ase the origin@@ als sustain@@ ably .
the software then presents the demands of black@@ mail presses .
to get the final key code to the files , the victims need to transfer money - mostly in the form of cryp@@ to@@ currency Bit@@ coin .
but where private users use the personal photo database on the game , companies are dealing with sensitive customer data or project databases without the production being shut down .
accordingly , the damage occurs when a ran@@ som@@ ware strikes .
22 percent of the German companies affected reported sales losses due to Ran@@ som@@ ware , 13 percent even had to stop business completely , in one case people were in danger of life .
several hospitals in Germany have already been victims of attacks whose patients can be ac@@ utely threatened by the loss of medical records .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we always say to the victims , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; does not pay , it only encourages the problem , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains Kl@@ ec@@ zy@@ n@@ ski . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but 80 to 90 percent of the companies that pay , get their data back .
for managers it is difficult to reject the claim of perpetr@@ ators in the face of a stand@@ still in operation .
the h@@ ack@@ ers again know that and try everything to build a good reputation .
in a recent study , the security researchers of F @-@ Secure analyzed the benefits and contact with the black@@ mail and come to the conclusion : the perpetr@@ ators actually try to build a kind of customer service to get more money .
they explain to their victims via chat how they can pay via Bit@@ coin , set up freely available support websites or de@@ cryp@@ t for free example files .
and if private persons are redeemed for payments of a few hundred euros , companies have to bar@@ gain some hard and pay five @-@ digit sums in order to get their data returned un@@ encrypted .
in view of potentially high and relatively risk @-@ free profits from the ran@@ som@@ ware black@@ mail , h@@ ack@@ ers are becoming more and more professional and share their work , explains Security Exper@@ ts Ch@@ ester Wis@@ ni@@ ew@@ ski of the antivirus provider SO@@ PH@@ OS : &quot; a single person can write a ran@@ som@@ ware circa within a week . &quot;
however , it is more likely that these are three or four people .
the program@@ mers then sell their malware in the form of a software tool@@ box to the actual black@@ mail presses .
the malware kit has been developed by buying malware yourself , advis@@ ing and providing additional tools for a unique , fixed price between 1000 and 10,000 dollars .
&quot; included is a fitting tool so that smaller configurations , appearance and br@@ anding can be changed , &quot; says Wis@@ ni@@ ew@@ ski .
the black@@ mail@@ ers then search for further h@@ ack@@ ers to spread the newly purchased software among the victims .
we live in a service industry .
so one logs in one of the underground forums , bu@@ ys the set of a criminal and commissions one another to install the software on as many PCs as possible .
payment is made per infected host .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; usually the criminals employ sp@@ amm@@ ers with the spread , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains Wis@@ ni@@ ew@@ ski . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the risk of ran@@ som@@ ware is now well @-@ known in many companies that better protect their data .
more than 50 percent of the companies IT leaders in the Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ ytes survey rely on resist@@ ing ran@@ som@@ ware by means of file back @-@ ups and scanner software .
accordingly , the perpetr@@ ators are already pursuing new strategies .
&quot; if data encryption alone is not a sufficient threat to successful edi@@ fication , the perpetr@@ ators are threatening to publish sensitive data such as customer lists or pricing strategies , &quot; explains Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ ytes leader Mar@@ cin Kl@@ ec@@ zy@@ n@@ ski .
this means that the damage potential , depending on the type of data , is much higher than before .
in the future , the perpetr@@ ators will also be able to take on entirely new targets on the internet of things .
at the Hack@@ er@@ konferenz , Def@@ con , security researchers demonstrated how they could get a thermo@@ stat connected to the Internet under their control .
in the middle of winter , the activation of such a blocked heating could be worth a ran@@ som .
if the perpetr@@ ators then block a whole production line in a factory instead of the heating in the future , Ran@@ som@@ ware could also be a topic in Industry 4.0 .
one for all cases
Honda HR @-@ V is flexible and suitable for everyday use
in the small HR @-@ V , Honda wants to pack everything : a little SUV , a little cou@@ pe and the versatility of a mini@@ v@@ ans .
sounds rather over@@ loaded , but the HR @-@ V , which was constructed on the same new platform as the new jazz , actually proves to be extremely flexible in everyday life .
although the HR @-@ V is only 1.@@ 60 m tall , the passengers have a lot of space both in the first row and in the rear , it does not work in any place .
the materials of the interior are well finished and pleasant , only the cockpit @-@ top falls down somewhat .
the HR @-@ V is more versatile than comparable vehicles for storage .
there is not only a boot space of 4@@ 53 l for raised and 10@@ 26 l in revers@@ ed back@@ rests , but there is the &quot; Magic Se@@ ats . &quot;
this is less magical than it sounds : the seat surfaces of the back bench can be folded up like a cinema chair and thus offer storage space , which is 1.@@ 24 m high from the floor to the ceiling .
the trunk can be loaded well , but the load height is 650 mm higher than the comparable Peugeot 2008 .
the tested 1.6 @-@ liter diesel with 88 kW / 120 hp acceler@@ ates the HR @-@ V very power@@ fully thanks to the torque of up to 300 Nm in wide speed ranges .
however , he is likely to do his work more quietly .
the daily consumption of 4.@@ 7 l / 100 km is pleasing .
there is another engine : a 1.5 @-@ litre petrol engine with 96 kW / 130 hp .
an all @-@ wheel drive is not offered .
the handling is balanced , a good compromise between dynam@@ ism and comfort .
but the steering should be a bit more direct .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the equipment leaves nothing to be desired in the tested &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Executive &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; top variant . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the safety systems include the City emergency brake assist ( works up to speed 32 ) , the collision warning system and the lane support assistant .
the collision warning sometimes irrit@@ ates because when maneu@@ vering , he ass@@ esses many obstacles as &quot; approaching objects . &quot;
the remote light assistant works very reliably .
and the intelligent speed controller re@@ acts to the traffic sign recognition and throt@@ tles the speed when needed .
but full connectivity is available only for the top features : 7 @-@ inch touch@@ screen , navigation system , app integration and more .
two US@@ B@@ - and one HDMI socket are below the arm@@ rest and are therefore somewhat cum@@ ber@@ some to achieve .
the roughly 29@@ ,000 euros for the well @-@ equipped top diesel are fine .
those who don &apos;t want to invest so much will get the petrol from 200@@ 00 Euro , the diesel from 23@@ ,000 euros .
the engines comply with the Euro 6 emissions standard .
with the HR @-@ V , Honda offers a versatile and everyday @-@ duty car .
Air@@ line is not liable : fall on air passenger bridge
an airline is not liable for the fall of a passenger on the air passenger bridge .
the Düsseldorf Higher Regional Court ( A@@ z . : 18 U 124 / 14 ) ar@@ gues that liability is only conceivable with danger that is typical for aviation .
the plain@@ ti@@ ff had broken a knee in the fall .
but the accident could have happened everywhere - it was a general risk of life , such as the court .
the airline had to pay no damages to the man .
case of illness : when the organis@@ er pays
after their journey , sick leave get money only when the cause of the disease is to be found in the hotel without a doubt .
however , this is only the case when more than ten percent of the guests have proven the same symptoms .
in the case of the trial , a family on the second day of her door@@ way was severely ill with diar@@ rho@@ ea and vom@@ iting .
she spent almost the entire vacation in the room .
their disease caused the vac@@ ation@@ ers to return to a defective wastewater treatment plant , allegedly polluted by sea@@ water .
the family thought that the trip was insufficient - and compl@@ ained against the organizer .
the plain@@ ti@@ ffs had no success in court .
indeed , the sewage treatment plant was indeed defective .
but the organis@@ er only learned about it shortly before the plain@@ ti@@ ff &apos;s departure .
until then , he had to assume that the sea@@ water was fine .
he did not violate his duty of information , so the judgment .
no im@@ puri@@ ties were found in the samples of the water .
the illness of several hotel guests - possibly by con@@ ta@@ gion among themselves - is a general risk of life .
of 6@@ 91 guests only 38 were sick .
after the violent acts committed by refugees in Wu@@ erz@@ burg and Ans@@ bach in July many people were worried about further attacks .
the state must respond to terrorist operation at the same time .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our country will not answer the violence of the perpetr@@ ators with hate and sch@@ ism . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we will not grant this triumph to the terrorists .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if offen@@ ders need to leave the country more quickly , they increase security and also strengthen the approval of the population for refugee policy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
de Ma@@ izi@@ ère intends to implement the proposals until the parliamentary elections in 2017 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he also announced further personnel strengthening of the security forces , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the middle four @-@ digit order of magnitude for several years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
sympathy for terrorism must be under penalty again .
video surveillance aims to improve the right of weapons in such a way that especially the purchase of weapons on the Internet is made more difficult .
the most recently discussed sec@@ rec@@ y of sec@@ rec@@ y for physicians is supposed to remain intact after de Ma@@ izi@@ ères words .
however , in the dialogue with the medical profession , he wants to look for solutions , how to reduce the risk of citizens , he said with regard to psych@@ ic ab@@ norm@@ alities .
in order to counter@@ act the radic@@ alization of refugees , the minister holds a better social care for them .
teachers should be better prepared for dealing with trau@@ mati@@ zed people .
to prosec@@ ute criminals in special areas of the Internet ( Dark@@ net ) , de Ma@@ izi@@ ère is planning the deployment of cover@@ t investig@@ ators .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; SPD leader Gabriel said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the SPD is ready to talk about everything that contributes to further enhancing safety . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is important that the Minister of the Interior has clearly declared himself against action . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was a sla@@ p for the sni@@ per in the CD@@ U / CS@@ U , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gabriel told the newspapers of the Fun@@ ke media group ( Friday ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
de Ma@@ izi@@ ère had rejected calls from the Union after a Bur@@ ka ban and the abolition of double nationality previously .
he considers a general ban on full @-@ we@@ aving to be constitu@@ tionally problematic .
you can &apos;t ban everything that you refuse and I reject the wearing of the bur@@ q@@ a .
it is possible to talk about rules for example in road traffic or for witnesses in court .
green boss Sim@@ one Peter accused the minister that he wanted to simulate with ever new anti @-@ terror packages of action and ability to act .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; left @-@ party leader Bernd Ri@@ ex@@ inger said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fleet pro@@ verb@@ s and a tightening of the right to stay bring people in this country no more safety . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
better traffic flow on the motorway
it st@@ owed regularly on the b@@ ypass road - here a picture of November .
but this is to change : the right @-@ to @-@ turn claim shall be extended .
this is good news for all the drivers who are standing in traffic on the ambient street every evening in traffic jams if they drive over the motorway to Zu@@ br@@ inger ( A 43 ) .
on the coming Tuesday and Wednesday ( 16 / 17 August ) , road construction will be extended by 700 metres between Hammer Straße and the Wes@@ er Straße exit .
drivers can then go directly from the hammer street to the right .
the big advantage : the traffic is split up early , thus improving the overall production sequence on the busy section of the Bundes@@ straße 51 .
the idea with the extended exit had the CD@@ U faction in the District and Repres@@ entation in Münster @-@ West .
the road con@@ stric@@ tion on the feeder raises the drivers above all between 17 and 19 o &apos;clock .
on week@@ days , the return trip goes up to the bridge across the Alber@@ gh@@ er Weg and sometimes beyond .
the ground is the needle &apos;s eye on the B 51 shortly before the Wes@@ eler street exit .
from here the traffic is guided only one lane via the motorway bridge .
the second track had to be rebuilt almost three @-@ quarters years ago .
the reason : static calculations had shown that the bridge no longer possesses the required load @-@ bearing capacity to absorb the heavy @-@ load traffic in two lanes .
as long as this bott@@ len@@ eck and the associated daily traffic jam will continue , the competent state company cannot say .
however , it has to be reck@@ oned with years : the bridge has an official remaining period of rest by 20@@ 34 .
for the extension of the legal amend@@ ment , the state company consciously chose the more traffic @-@ weaker time in the school holidays because with disabilities it is to be expected .
the traffic is passed on on Tuesday and Wednesday in a single lane at the construction site .
intercultural Travel : cultural offers for schools
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the international class of Wald@@ schule attended the play &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The invisible house . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the association N@@ ima &apos;s and the Young Theater are now planning a music project .
N@@ ima &apos;s association enables young people with a migration and refugee background to visit cultural institutions in Münster .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; class International &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of the Children &apos;s House has a presentation of the award @-@ winning piece &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The invisible house &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of the young theater Münster . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the context of the &quot; Inter@@ cultural Trip &quot; initiated by the association N@@ ima &apos;s &quot; Inter@@ cultural Journey , &quot; 19 students between the ages of 11 and 15 visited the st@@ aging at the Small House .
since the beginning of the year , the association , which aims to promote cultural integration of young people with a migration and refugee background , offers schools with welcome classes the opportunity to visit cultural institutions in Münster in the context of this project .
most young people of the class had come to Münster between September 2015 and March 2016 , among others , from Afghanistan , Iran , Serbia and Syria and speak little German .
thanks to the chore@@ ographies , the scenic pictures and video animations it was possible for them to follow the course of action nevertheless , thus the press release of the Young Theater Münster .
the association N@@ ima &apos;s , founded by Dr. Tann@@ az West@@ er@@ berg from Spra@@ kel , and the Young Theater will work together in the coming season as part of a music theatre project .
from October to December , young people with and without escape and migration background will be given the opportunity to attend professionally guided courses in the fields of singing , dance , acting and music .
offers for children and families in the field of theatre play and theat@@ rical language placement are in the planning .
the &quot; Inter@@ cultural Journey &quot; project goes on .
in view of the increased number of refugees , the association pays off with many classes who want to participate .
rain instead of shooting stars : hope for weather improvement
the weather has made the shooting star Gu@@ ck@@ ern in the southwest of Germany on Friday a line through the bill - but there is still hope .
the night was poorly suited for clouds and rain to watch the cel@@ esti@@ al spectacle , said the chairman of the Astronom@@ ical Observ@@ atory Wel@@ z@@ heim , Hans @-@ Ulrich Keller , on Friday morning .
our hope is on the night to Saturday .
the weather should be good , then we will see many shooting stars in the sky .
the shooting stars are Per@@ sei@@ ds , which are one of the quick@@ est shooting stars at 2@@ 16@@ 000 kilometers per hour .
they have their name because they seem to come from the con@@ stellation Per@@ se@@ us , which rises in the north @-@ east .
relaxing night : tips against sleeping disorders
in the evening , you roll around forever , at night you lie awake for hours , in the morning it is no longer possible to think of sleep long before the alarm bells .
this is anything but relaxing .
after all , one is in good society with such problems : according to the Robert Koch Institute , about a quarter of adults have sleep disorders and more than ten percent find their sleep frequently or permanently as not restor@@ ative .
how do sleep problems or sleep disturbances manifest ?
there are several forms of sleep disorders , and there can be a variety of causes behind them , emphas@@ ises Hans @-@ Günter We@@ eau , member of the board of the German Society for Schla@@ ff@@ or@@ eption and Sle@@ eping Medicine .
however , what you understand is the in@@ som@@ nia , that is , a distur@@ b@@ ance and per@@ sever@@ ance .
many people feel as uns@@ atis@@ factory or insufficient , says Jens Wagen@@ knecht , member of the board of the German House Medical Association with practice in Var@@ el , Lower Saxony .
what is behind sleep disorders ?
the causes of sleep disorders are complex .
behind it can be organic , mental or behavi@@ our@@ al factors , but also medications .
in@@ frequently , sleep disorder is an expression of another disease .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; very early awakening is particularly common in depression , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says We@@ eau . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and it can be that different factors are dependent upon each other .
for example , those who have a sli@@ pped disc can be bad , wake up every two or three hours and possibly start to think about everyday problems and worries , there is an example .
this leads to tension and sleep is no longer possible .
when should sleep disorders become a doctor ?
those who do not sleep well over a period of one month in at least three nights a week should go to the doctor , advises wear .
the impairment can look quite different : one is beaten , tired , sleep@@ y , has difficulties with attention and concentration , is easily irrit@@ able , has mood sw@@ ings or physical ail@@ ments such as stomach or head@@ aches .
to allevi@@ ate sleep disorders , it is important to find out their causes .
treatment options include behavi@@ our@@ al changes , cognitive behavi@@ our@@ al therapy , or even medicines - classical sleeping tablets only in exceptional cases and at most for two weeks .
in Germany , Dr. In@@ go Fi@@ etze , head of the interdisciplinary sleep medical centre of the Char@@ ité University Medicine Berlin , under@@ lines the low @-@ lying sleeping physician in Germany .
for this reason , one should first contact the family doctor in case of sleeping problems , says We@@ eau .
it can clarify with investigations whether the problems have a physical cause .
who should go to sleep laboratory , and what will happen ?
for the examination in the sleep laboratory , physicians advise , for example , snor@@ ing with respir@@ ators , in case of sick daily fatigue , in sleeping trans@@ duc@@ ers , or if one does not find the cause of a sleep disorder , Fi@@ etze explains .
it is not necessary to prepare for the investigation .
you should spend the day normal .
&quot; please do not make a n@@ ap , &quot; says Fi@@ etze .
after the sti@@ cking , one goes to bed at its normal time .
besides the electrodes on the body , one carries a nose go@@ g@@ gles , a chest strap and an anten@@ na@@ e on the finger .
in addition , a camera records the sleeping @-@ end at the ceiling .
how can those affected get a grip on the problems ?
there are quite a lot of adjusting screws on which one can apply for a better sleep .
fire counts on : regular sleeping and opening times , not too long in bed , do not sleep on the day , do not watch television to sleep , avoid alcohol and do not watch the clock at night - then you start to reck@@ on immediately , and that &apos;s absolutely not condu@@ ci@@ ve to it .
what the jungle camp has with missing med@@ als in swimming
former German swi@@ mmer Markus Dei@@ bler has commented on Facebook for the dis@@ ap@@ pointing cut of the DS@@ V team at Olymp@@ us .
in December 2014 , he took gold for the first time at the World Championships in Doh@@ a and at the same time presented his first world record .
now the former DS@@ V @-@ ath@@ lete Markus Dei@@ bler has placed himself in front of his ex @-@ team @-@ mates via Facebook .
&quot; in a country where an Olympic Champion gets 20,000 € premium and a jungle King 150@@ ,000 € no one should wonder about missing med@@ als , &quot; wrote the 26 @-@ year @-@ old at night on his Facebook page .
the transport system in the swimming sport is bad , however , the dop@@ ing controls are very good .
this means that we cannot compete with countries that promote a great deal and do not even look closely at the topic of dop@@ ing or even operate it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t say that the controls should be set here , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he explained further . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if he wanted to make a com@@ eback , Dei@@ bler had to be reported nine months before his first launch of the National Anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency Germany ( NA@@ DA ) .
that is exactly how it should be done with countries .
&quot; if you cannot control a certain time before WM / OS by independent controllers of WA@@ DA / FIN@@ A , it is not allowed to take part , &quot; says the election Hamburger , who meanwhile operates an ice cream par@@ lor .
airport : ban@@ ger det@@ ained by baggage
professional thi@@ eves at Düsseldorf airport
on Thursday , the police managed the arrest of two women and two men aged 50 to 61 .
the suspect committed several hand@@ ker@@ chiefs and bags .
at 21.@@ 30 , civil servants in the area of the Düsseldorf airport recognised a gang that was known to the police officers from previous theft cases .
the two women and two men had committed several off@@ ences since the middle of July , and were involved in a collaborative , social and particularly professional manner .
the specialists of the criminal comm@@ iss@@ ary 34 can demonstrate four actions to the dict@@ ators who had been specially invited to commit criminal off@@ ences to Germany .
in doing so they had a total of more than 15,000 Euro .
old buildings , a few lime trees , in between still a remainder of cob@@ ble@@ stone pav@@ ement : the Riga Street in Berlin @-@ Friedrichsha@@ in does not seem like at first sight , but the police count them to the &quot; dangerous places &quot; of the city .
walking along the road from east to west , one passes by play@@ grounds , a freshly painted kinder@@ garten and a bi@@ ol@@ ades .
someone &quot; ug@@ ly ! &quot; spra@@ yed on the facade of a grey house .
in front of a Li@@ dl , which will soon be demol@@ ished , it is already being built : until 2017 there will be a house with high windows and 133 new apartments .
article about this &quot; trendy part , &quot; as the responsible real estate company Friedrichsha@@ in calls , will be preferred in the last weeks with burning automobil@@ es .
the reason is the house with number 94 : once it was occupied , the residents now have le@@ ases , but on the ground floor there are still rooms occupied and are used for events .
since the beginning of the year , the Berlin indoor sen@@ ator Henkel has repeatedly called for a hard action of the police against the project , the area referred to as &quot; No @-@ Go @-@ Zone &quot; for police officers and the 94 as the starting point of autonomous violence .
after having cleared the rooms on the ground floor , the Kad@@ ter@@ schmi@@ ede , with 300 police officers , the police pat@@ rolled three weeks of official statements with 30 to 40 officials and three team cars on site , locked parts of the road and stopped visitors to enter the house with the number 94 .
meanwhile , the renovated building workers commissioned the rooms for the unknown owners of the house .
on 13 July , a Berlin administrative court ruled that the clearing had been illegal , and a day later , police and construction workers mar@@ ched under the jubil@@ ation of sympath@@ iz@@ ers and residents .
on this summer afternoon the street acts peac@@ efully : parents walk with children , people sit on the side@@ walk in front of the houses in the sun , others talk about vor@@ m late .
in the immediate vicinity of the house projects are a primary school and kinder@@ gar@@ tens .
left violence is not the main concern of many residents : Ker@@ stin Neu@@ geb@@ auer , who lives in Kie@@ z since 1999 , and Jan@@ a * , who has three children here , are mostly stressed by the police presence .
with the inhabitants of the house projects they share the concern of rising r@@ ents and gent@@ ri@@ fication .
it doesn &apos;t sound like a Kie@@ z , who mostly wanted police protection against v@@ and@@ ali@@ ating left .
the dit@@ ch , which the Berlin inner sen@@ ator and the police between the land@@ lords and their neighbors open up , apparently does not exist .
Friedrichsha@@ in in the east of Berlin was actually a traditional working @-@ class district , which even today compared to the rest of the city has a low average income and a high risk of poverty .
also house occup@@ ations and the resulting housing projects belong to the Kie@@ z for a long time : in 1990 , numerous houses were occupied in the former G@@ DR , among them nearly the entire Main@@ zer Straße very close to the Rig@@ a@@ er .
while the Main@@ zer had been evacu@@ ated under a large police force in a regular street fight , many of the projects in the Riga were leg@@ alized and are still inhabited by the people who occupied them 26 years ago .
at the same time , in recent years , the neighborhood has become increasingly a magnet for tourists and poll@@ in@@ ators from all over the world : residents of G@@ DR times and former home users share their Kie@@ z with them .
this is also reflected in the r@@ ents , which have increased by almost 60 percent since 2009 .
many of the new buildings in the Rig@@ a@@ er are being attacked as symbols for this development : they recognize them of pushed pan@@ es or freshly painted facades , which were thrown with paint bags .
no other road was mentioned this year together with the words &quot; left @-@ autonomous violence . &quot;
one reason that not all neighbours see this as a problem might be that they are not necessarily affected by crime : crimes like body injury have been directed almost exclusively against polic@@ emen .
most of the crimes constitute property damage , which tend to meet the newly built and newly renovated houses .
for Ker@@ stin Neu@@ geb@@ auer , who lives in a rented house for 17 years alongside the controversial 94 , there can be no talk of uncertainty .
as for violence , it is important : the people in the 94 are their neighbours who have not been determined .
even the famous burning cars are no longer able to give it directly to the Rig@@ a@@ er .
for the educated architect , her street is not a criminal focus , on the contrary : &quot; here one helps each other , lives together on the street and gets more of each other than elsewhere . &quot;
Neu@@ geb@@ auer was consciously drawn into the Riga Street - and remained .
that is why it was so important for her to get back to her streets : from the police , politics and the media , which in July all suddenly claimed the sovereignty over the district .
but in the eyes of inhabitants such as Neu@@ geb@@ auer , the street will still be taken away from them : through fac@@ eless new@@ builds in former construction gaps , which disp@@ lace the old inhabitants .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these are con@@ domini@@ ums that are not interesting for many here - more people who are not so well contaminated , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I cannot be absolutely endor@@ sing &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; violence and destruction . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but what do you want to do if you never listen to someone ?
there is fru@@ stration on all sides , even with the police and the inhabitants .
for star@@ ters who are angry about color bombs Ker@@ stin has a little understanding : the house projects and the left scene belonged to the Kie@@ z .
those who prefer should be aware of it - just like someone who moves into a pub area that can complain bad about noise .
all persons presented only with first names have asked to not be named with their proper name
Ur@@ bach : Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le is new refugee commission@@ er
Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le is the contact person for integration and organizer .
she is also a social worker on site .
Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le has been the refugee commission@@ er for Ur@@ bach since July .
the Social Ped@@ ago@@ gue supports the team of Administration for Ach@@ im Gro@@ cken@@ berger .
she sees herself as contact partner for all actors : refugees , working group , refugee assistance , administration , authorities and those who else join in .
Reg@@ ine client of the working group suggests that the volunteers are more than thank@@ ful that Deu@@ sch@@ le is now there , who has a problem especially .
some - less mo@@ ck@@ ingly but rather targeted on the multitude of desired task areas - meant that the administration wanted to write the job .
we were looking for an administrative specialist with a talent for languages and people , combined with a long @-@ standing experience in the field of social work , just a wo@@ oping mil@@ k@@ mil@@ k@@ sau .
but administrative work is not its central area , Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le says .
above all , it is about organization , work with local people and behind the scenes as well as network activity .
the 31 @-@ year @-@ old has been there for about six weeks .
it has a 50 percent position limited to three years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was high time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Reg@@ ine Client that Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le supports honest and full @-@ time actors . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are big and small problems , organizational , human and communication problems .
new containers soon arrive at the Was@@ en@@ straße
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it has been a serious problem for some time to find housing for the connecting refugees who have been recognized . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the municipalities are responsible for the provision of the connection .
they must accommodate the refugees in their own or rented living rooms .
the municipalities themselves must bear the costs for the construction , the rent or the renovation of these accommodations .
the responsibility changes from the office of coun@@ cils to the Comm@@ une and Job@@ center .
problem : there are free objects , but not every landlord wants to offer his apartment .
the search has been very difficult for some time now .
de facto , the administration does not find private apartments .
so far , it does not work , so be reli@@ ant on private dwell@@ ings , such as Deu@@ sch@@ le .
therefore , communal dwell@@ ings must be consolidated as it is so beautiful .
so soon new containers are placed in the car wash road .
but only with apartments it is not done .
perspective is the keyword , Reg@@ ine client and Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le agree .
in addition to a permanent residence , there are intern@@ ships , apprentices@@ hips , school grounds , one @-@ euro jobs and hel@@ pers for refugees and migrants who need to be dev@@ oured or established .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; more places would be good , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Reg@@ ine Client . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
many work in the building yard or help home@@ workers , do non@@ profit work - and that is motivated and very neat , as Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le reports .
she hopes that the work for the community will lead to a positive external action .
that is &quot; no occupational therapy . &quot;
but activity does not just mean work .
the day needs a firm structure , say Deu@@ sch@@ le and customer .
people would have to develop a sense of belonging .
so I need offers like sports , contacts with locals and especially language courses .
professional courses are rare .
so also jump here administration and volunteers here .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is central that the refugees feel they are welcome and welcome in Germany . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the long duration of the procedure is a problem .
they have to explain to the refugees that it takes time and they can make use of time wis@@ ely , for example with language courses .
whoever develops the feeling that he can &apos;t help anyone in Ur@@ bach , may not work and be useless , he will never integrate .
the clear majority is motivated .
but there are problems , &quot; says customer hon@@ estly , &quot; people with nothing at all . &quot; the work of Deu@@ sch@@ le and customer is therefore always to motiv@@ ate others .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all this is already a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mamm@@ oth task . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a difficult question : do the two have fear of radic@@ alisation , even in a small church like Ur@@ bach ?
&quot; no , &quot; Reg@@ ine client clearly states &quot; what some nai@@ ve likes . &quot; a residual risk could and would not exclude them .
however , the hel@@ pers are already sensi@@ ti@@ zed .
these incidents are also subject to the refugees .
they would be afraid that the kill@@ ers would put them in jail .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they want to show that they have nothing to do with it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Reg@@ ine Client . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
many would like to stay in Ur@@ bach .
so the local and honorary officials have to look out for activities locally and in the region .
they always have in the background that soon a new impetus for refugees and migrants could come to Ur@@ bach .
does Germany need a cap ?
the question is clear to answer this question .
actually it is unfair to put them on site hel@@ pers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Ur@@ bach , we haven &apos;t arrived where we want to go , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
no new refugees , that would relax the situation .
Reg@@ ine client also makes it clear that the Ur@@ bacher is already busy to integrate the existing people in a reasonable manner .
these are currently around 100 people , mainly young men .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but when people are in need , they must help them , both women agree . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the political world situation is so complicated , there are no simple answers .
