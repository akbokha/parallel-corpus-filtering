<seg id="1">Golfer Langer receives the sports pyramid</seg>
<seg id="2">His experiences on the horse are manageable.</seg>
<seg id="3">At the end of a golf tournament in South Africa Bernhard Langer with some colleagues sought a bit of diversion with a ride on the beach.</seg>
<seg id="4">For the 58-year-old it was a premiere.</seg>
<seg id="5">CHIO: "golden age pyramid" for Bernhard Langer</seg>
<seg id="6">After a few minutes, the horses remembered their holiday, they hunted at home in the fast gallop.</seg>
<seg id="7">One kilometer at this pace, I was afraid.</seg>
<seg id="8">"it was not a good experience," Langer says.</seg>
<seg id="9">And then the riding career ended up again.</seg>
<seg id="10">On Saturday, Germany's best golfer was - 101 tournament wins - again near horses.</seg>
<seg id="11">He let himself guide himself with his family over the plant of the ALRV, on a horse he did not shoot himself for photo purposes.</seg>
<seg id="12">Long was the first time in Aachen and with it also at CHIO.</seg>
<seg id="13">The reason was quite convincing.</seg>
<seg id="14">The German Sporthilfe was handed over to the man from Anhausen in the course of a small gala, the Golden Sports Pyramid.</seg>
<seg id="15">There is no lack of accolades to the sympathetic athlete.</seg>
<seg id="16">Federal Cross of Merit, Silver bay leaf, champions tour player of the year...</seg>
<seg id="17">Even the British Queen has already adored him.</seg>
<seg id="18">The 18th winner of the sports pyramid is long.</seg>
<seg id="19">In Aachen he met the first winner Hans Günter Winkler on Saturday.</seg>
<seg id="20">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "this award means a lot to me," "" "" "" "says Langer," "" "" "" "because it is not only awarded for sporting achievements but also for social commitment." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="21">Langer has been promoting young talent for decades.</seg>
<seg id="22">And so he also offered the prize money of 25,000 euros.</seg>
<seg id="23">With 15 other outstanding athletes, the two-time US master winner was admitted to the "Hall of Fame of German Sports" on Saturday.</seg>
<seg id="24">The winners include the athletes of Hartwig Gauder and Harald Schmitt, the winner Cornelia Hanisch, Alexander Pusch and Arnd Schmitt, the Ruderer Peter-Michael Kolbe, Bob-driver Meinhard Nehmer, the Judoka Frank Wieneke, the jumper of Alwin Schocker's öhle and posthum the Handballer Erhard Wunderlich.</seg>
<seg id="25">Many of these sports grounds arrived in Aachen on Saturday.</seg>
<seg id="26">After the official part, the illustrious company moved to the Springstadium, where the Lavazza Prize was running.</seg>

<seg id="1">Compare clinics and trumps economic policies compared to IT's all about the money</seg>
<seg id="2">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "invest in infrastructure and prevent TTP trade agreement - that's both Clinton and Trump." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="3">However, the two US presidential candidates are in the tax and energy policy as well as in a fundamental issue.</seg>
<seg id="4">The difference in economic policy between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton is a fundamental, rather philosophical difference.</seg>
<seg id="5">On the role of the state.</seg>
<seg id="6">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "Trump wants to keep the doubts rather small and warns against how the state can harm the economy - with taxes and regulations." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="7">Clinton wants to tax the economy to death and regulate it to death, he says.</seg>
<seg id="8">He himself, on the other hand, would be quite different, claiming Trump.</seg>
<seg id="9">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "he will drive back regulations massively, and he is strong for a far-reaching tax reform with lower tax rates - for private people and for businesses." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="10">Clinton, on the other hand, says: the state has to fulfil certain tasks, it has disadvantaged opportunities to open up and needs money for it.</seg>
<seg id="11">That is why taxes are increased for the rich, she says.</seg>
<seg id="12">Interestingly, both are very close to the topic infrastructure.</seg>
<seg id="13">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "we need to invest in that," "" "" "" "Trump and Clinton said almost verbatim." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="14">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "the democratic applicant announces the biggest investment in new jobs since World War II." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="15">State investment programs in the infrastructure are classic democratic politics and are strictly rejected by the state-critical wing of the Republicans.</seg>
<seg id="16">So on Trump we could still deal with party-internal discussions.</seg>
<seg id="17">The differences in energy and climate policy are more evident.</seg>
<seg id="18">Trump wants to build coal-fired power plants and drive coal mining in the US again.</seg>
<seg id="19">Oil production should also be possible in previously protected areas, the Paris climate protection agreement wants to cancel it.</seg>
<seg id="20">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "Clinton, on the other hand, wants to explicitly extend the renewable energies with its investment program:" "" "" "" "a country will become the super power of clean energy and create millions jobs." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="21">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "it will be either China, Germany or America - I want we to be." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="22">But not only in the infrastructure - even in international trade agreements, the two competitors are not too far apart from each other.</seg>
<seg id="23">TPP, the transpazilian trade agreement, do not want to sign both.</seg>
<seg id="24">At the same time, both want to isolate the US from international trade - rather than simply protect American jobs.</seg>
<seg id="25">They should be paid even better, says Clinton.</seg>
<seg id="26">The present minimum wage of 7.25 US dollars is a wage of hunger.</seg>
<seg id="27">It wants to raise it to $15 per hour.</seg>
<seg id="28">What trump wants to do in this question is not quite clear: once he says: the minimum wage must rise, then he says he must not be changed.</seg>
<seg id="29">But the big discussion of the coming months would probably be more likely to develop the tax policy of the two camps.</seg>
<seg id="30">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "on the one hand is Trump, who wants to relieve the economy and citizens to boost growth." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="31">His critics assert him that the budget deficit would only be greater.</seg>
<seg id="32">On the other hand, Clinton, who wants at least from the rich, wants to pay more taxes, and their critics say: more taxes are not the solution either.</seg>

<seg id="15">The four women in the kitchen are Poultry.</seg>
<seg id="16">They live in the north of Munich in one of the few decentral accommodations for women and their children in Bavaria.</seg>
<seg id="17">In January, Condrobs opened up the facility together with Pro Familia and the Munich Frauenhilfe.</seg>
<seg id="18">Recently it was officially opened.</seg>
<seg id="19">60 people live there - about 40 women and 20 children.</seg>

<seg id="29">And the women are alone, they are not protected by their families.</seg>
<seg id="30">Those who believe that the end, as soon as they come in Germany, irre, tells Bahr.</seg>
<seg id="31">Here too, single women in refugee camps would often be considered inferior and worst abused.</seg>
<seg id="32">This means that approximately 90 percent of women who live in the accommodation in the north of Munich are traumatized, they appreciate.</seg>
<seg id="33">"some of the children are certainly not born voluntarily."</seg>

<seg id="2">Representatives of the assistance physicians have called on their union to approve new combat measures in their disputes concerning a new contract.</seg>
<seg id="3">The Junior Doctors Committee (JDC) of the British Medical Association (BMA) has called for its entire Council to approve more work combat measures starting from the beginning of September.</seg>
<seg id="4">The JDC said that ministers had agreed to deal with the concerns regarding the contract.</seg>

<seg id="6">It was rejected by 58% of its members voted in elections.</seg>
<seg id="7">In a letter to the members who were published on Twitter on Thursday evening, the chairman of the JDC Ellen McCourt said that the government was "persistently calm" to problems, leading to the fact that the treaty was rejected.</seg>

<seg id="1">Russia and Turkey: an "alliance of outsiders"?</seg>
<seg id="2">It was a gesture that ended a crisis.</seg>
<seg id="3">The leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to surrender their hands and to announce the official end of the eight-month war of words and economic sanctions.</seg>
<seg id="4">But when Vladimir Putin receives his Turkish counterpart in the gilded hall of St. Petersburg Palace, I cannot deny the impression that Ankara will most want this reconciliation.</seg>
<seg id="5">There was a handshake, yes.</seg>
<seg id="6">But Putin's smile was slippery and he radiated hardly any heat, even for his restrained circumstances.</seg>
<seg id="7">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "Recep Tayyip Erdogan, on the other hand, spoke of his" "" "" "" "dear friend" "" "" "" "Putin," "" "" "" "according to a report, five times." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="8">I couldn't count it any more.</seg>
<seg id="9">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "he also promised that relations with Russia would not only return to its old level before the crisis, but can even be improved." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="10">The next day, a newspaper wrote that Erdogan had behaved as if something bad had never happened.</seg>
<seg id="11">To me, his enthusiasm seemed to suggest the opposite.</seg>
<seg id="12">But one of Putin's radiant, sustainable coolness showed that Russia's head of state had forgotten nothing.</seg>
<seg id="13">Rather, the cause of the crisis was the first thing he mentioned in his introductory words: the snapshot of a Russian fighter plane on the Syrian border through Turkey.</seg>
<seg id="14">Moscow's reaction to the time was kindled.</seg>
<seg id="15">Putin denounced and accused Ankara of having fallen into the back of Russia.</seg>
<seg id="16">The offence was even greater since it was committed by a supposed friend.</seg>
<seg id="17">Building the cousins again becomes difficult, if not even impossible.</seg>
<seg id="18">Public opinion in Russia has changed since November.</seg>
<seg id="19">For months, state-controlled media held a violent, unrestricted attack on Ankara.</seg>
<seg id="20">At one time it seemed as if the Turks were to blame for everything.</seg>
<seg id="21">Most serious were the accusations of senior officials that Erdogan's own family would have benefited from illegal oil trade in Syria, controlled by the so-called Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="22">He denied this vehemently.</seg>
<seg id="23">But in St.Petersburg the official message was that it was time to look forward.</seg>
<seg id="24">Finally, this meeting was held only because Putin received the excuse from President Erdogan that he wanted to hear.</seg>
<seg id="25">Russia could claim a kind of victory.</seg>
<seg id="26">For Ankara, the advantages of a ceasefire are obvious.</seg>
<seg id="27">Erdogan mainly needs all the friends he can get after he has been relieved of his ministry last month in a failed coup d "état.</seg>
<seg id="28">Repeated terrorist attacks on Turkey have also shocked him.</seg>
<seg id="29">But there are also economic motives.</seg>
<seg id="30">Russian sanctions have hit Turkey hard - in particular the ban on charter flights that usually bring several million Russian tourists to the Turkish coast every year.</seg>
<seg id="31">The number decreased by almost 90%.</seg>
<seg id="32">In Russia tour operators and charter companies will be relieved when flights are resumed.</seg>
<seg id="33">They are based on a late seasonal storm on the Mediterranean Sea.</seg>
<seg id="34">This week, the State TV forecast cheap fruit and vegetables as soon as the Turkish agricultural imports are allowed.</seg>
<seg id="35">"" "" "" "a report in Vedemsti put it as follows:" "" "" "" "tourists there long, tomatoes here long." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="36">But the visit had an additional political value for Moscow.</seg>
<seg id="37">Ankara is angry with the West as it regards its reaction to the attempted takeover of power as a weak answer.</seg>
<seg id="38">In addition, the ongoing resentment on the snail pace of EU accession negotiations and Putin, which is eager to benefit from the cool mood and to lessen the relationship between Turkey and the West.</seg>
<seg id="39">The Russian head of state won in Ankara a bonus that he called for support for the elected state organs after the attempted coup d "état.</seg>
<seg id="40">This is a matter of course for Moscow, which itself has a profound fear of regime change.</seg>
<seg id="41">The summit in this glorious palace on the sea enabled Russia and Turkey to show how an analyst once described an "alliance of outsiders": two countries that have rejected and treated themselves badly by the West and are now allied with.</seg>
<seg id="42">Nevertheless, despite public reconciliation, there are still big differences between the two.</seg>
<seg id="43">The biggest difference is Syria, where Moscow has recently given its role as a peacemaker, but where Russia and Turkey support opposing sides.</seg>
<seg id="44">It could be significant that after almost three hours of initial talks, both presidents said at the press conference that they did not even take the subject.</seg>
<seg id="45">The President of Turkey deliberately avoided answering a question about their differences, while Putin chose to emphasize this.</seg>
<seg id="46">There is no clear consensus on where a common denominator can be found in Syria.</seg>
<seg id="47">But after months of open hostilities - and in the face of the potential for a perfect disaster when NATO member Turkey fired the Russian fighter jet - it is certainly better that the two Heads of State at least talk to each other again.</seg>

<seg id="1">Russian Putin humidifies chief of staff Sergei Ivanov</seg>
<seg id="2">Russian President Vladimir Putin has unexpectedly dismissed his chief of staff Sergei Ivanov.</seg>
<seg id="3">IVANOV was part of Putin's tightest confidence many years.</seg>
<seg id="4">The 63-year-old was appointed Special Representative for Environment and Transport Affairs.</seg>
<seg id="5">In a statement by the Kremlin it reads that without stating reasons "Putin ordered the dismissal of Ivanovo from his duties as chairman of the Russian presidential administration."</seg>
<seg id="6">Anton Vaino, who had been his deputy since 2012, has been appointed to his successor.</seg>
<seg id="7">Vaino, 44, is a former diplomat.</seg>
<seg id="8">Born in Tallinn, Estonia, in 1972, he graduated from the prestigious State Moscow Institute for International Relations (MGIMO) and worked in the Tokyo embassy.</seg>
<seg id="9">On the website of the Kremlin, it is called (in Russian) that he later was the chief manager and chief of staff of the registrar.</seg>
<seg id="10">"" "" "" "he said to Putin about his appointment:" "" "" "" "thank you for your confidence." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="11">I think it is the most important task of the government to support your activity as Head of State on bills of law and controls to implement your instructions.</seg>
<seg id="12">Putin told the Russian TV station on Friday that Ivanov asked to leave his post and Vaino recommended it as his successor.</seg>
<seg id="13">Are the smiling faces convincing?</seg>
<seg id="14">This step has made Moscow mystical.</seg>
<seg id="15">Sergei Ivanov was a long time one of the closest familiar Vladimir Putin and works like him for the Soviet secret service, the KGB.</seg>
<seg id="16">He was one of the most powerful men in the country.</seg>
<seg id="17">At a meeting with President Putin, which was broadcasted on television, both men asserted that the chief of staff resigned upon their own request.</seg>
<seg id="18">But despite the smile for the cameras, only a few of them are convinced - especially now, just before the parliamentary elections.</seg>
<seg id="19">So is the result of a kind of power struggle?</seg>
<seg id="20">Nobody knows that at the moment.</seg>
<seg id="21">But the official assertion that a man who once was touted as a potential president ought to once again lead the Russian environmental policy - pushed to great skepticism.</seg>
<seg id="22">In his remarks to Putin cited on the Kremlin's website, Ivanov said "It is true that I asked you in a conversation at the beginning of 2012, to me this very complicated post - you could almost say - arresting post for four years.</seg>
<seg id="23">As it turns out, I have been chairman of the Russian presidential administration for four years and eight months.</seg>
<seg id="24">IVANOV took up the post in December 2011.</seg>
<seg id="25">Previously, he was Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defence.</seg>
<seg id="26">He is a member of the Russian Security Council and, like Putin, former member of the State Security Service KGB.</seg>
<seg id="27">In the late 1990s, when Putin was President of the Federal Security Service (FSB), who replaced the KGB, Ivanov was appointed his deputy.</seg>
<seg id="28">When Putin came to power, he called Ivanov one of the five people he trusted most.</seg>
<seg id="29">It was once believed that after Putin's second term, Ivanov could become president of Russia, as a third term of Putin had violated the constitution.</seg>
<seg id="30">But this post was taken by another close ally of Putin, Dmitry Medvedev.</seg>
<seg id="31">Putin became prime minister before he became President three and a half years later.</seg>

<seg id="2">The £1.35 billion project is to be completed by May 2017</seg>
<seg id="3">Engineers have connected the northern deck of Queensland crossings to the viaduct - which means that the bridge is now connected with fife.</seg>
<seg id="4">It is the first of four closures of the "ceiling blower" that approach the completion around each of the three towers of the bridge.</seg>
<seg id="5">The bridge of Fife is now 600 metres long and weighs 30,000 tonnes.</seg>
<seg id="6">It has 10,000 tons of steel and 20,000 tons of concrete and 46 bevel cables.</seg>
<seg id="7">The £1.35 billion project is to be completed by May 2017.</seg>
<seg id="8">Business Minister Keith Brown visited the construction site today and was one of the first to go from the country to the bridge.</seg>
<seg id="9">"" "" "" "he said," "" "" "" "This is a historic and symbolic moment during the construction of the Queensland crossings." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="10">We are all witnesses of an engineering art of a truly epic scale in this project with over 30,000 tons of concrete and steel used alone for this part of the bridge.</seg>
<seg id="11">Despite the massive size and weight of the bridge, the completion of the connection between the viaduct and the bridge deck is a delicate activity that requires extremely precise tolerances for fit.</seg>
<seg id="12">In total, almost 79% of the total bridge decks in their place and the last section of the deck now gets a concrete shot in Rosyth for the deck, which means that the entire deck is ready to be lifted on the bridge to its place.</seg>
<seg id="13">Michael Martin, Project Manager of Forth Crossing Bridge Constructors, said: "the first closure is a significant milestone in each bridge project.</seg>
<seg id="14">With this fantastic project, the closure is future-proof high-rise and civil engineering.</seg>
<seg id="15">After the installation of the last stretch of road and its connection with the north tower on the north, we had to close the existing gap in the north or the landing side.</seg>
<seg id="16">This was achieved by pulling the northern feeder bridge 700 millimeters to the south.</seg>
<seg id="17">This was a massive and at the same time very delicate activity.</seg>
<seg id="18">Massive, since the viaduct is 222 metres long, weighs about 6,000 tons and has to be pulled upwards at an incline of approx. 3%.</seg>
<seg id="19">Uncle, because the tolerances on which the team worked are tiny - on each side they were just a few millimeters.</seg>

<seg id="3">How can one react to the bad news that Braunschweig is losing nearly 1300 inexpensive apartments over the next few years?</seg>
<seg id="4">The SPD is proposing a "housing concept living" for the next session of the council.</seg>
<seg id="5">But strife is programmed.</seg>
<seg id="6">First and foremost, the question is: who should actually build the cheap apartments?</seg>
<seg id="7">A regulation is missing so far.</seg>
<seg id="8">"" "" "" "said S & D Group president Christoph Bratmann:" "" "" "" "we agree with the Greens:" "" "" "" "in the future, those who want to build on urban areas must pay 20 percent of all apartments as social housing." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="9">The cheap apartments, however, can also arise in the continuance.</seg>
<seg id="10">"" "" "" "however, the great point of contention in the town hall is, as Bratmann says:" "" "" "" "how do you deal with investors who want to build on private land?" "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="11">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "we want investors to build at least 10 percent on such surfaces, but as much as 20 percent of the apartments as social housing." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="12">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "a new urban housing development program that will cost millions and still needs to be financed should provide incentives." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="13">"" "" "" "the problem, so Bratmann says:" "" "" "" "there is currently no agreement between the factions." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="14">The CDU wants to make investors as few as possible.</seg>
<seg id="15">The left wants even tougher print runs for investors.</seg>
<seg id="16">Despite this, as viola, a sharpening of the situation on the housing market is emerging.</seg>
<seg id="17">If the action concept is implemented, this will provide additional tasks in the building administration.</seg>
<seg id="18">More staff is needed.</seg>
<seg id="19">It is unclear whether we will get the skilled workers.</seg>
<seg id="20">But the program is not entirely up-to-date: the approximately 1260 new apartments, which should be built anyway.</seg>
<seg id="21">But how to compensate for the loss of some 1300 inexpensive apartments, whose funding will expire over the next few years?</seg>
<seg id="22">By 2020 alone, there will be 500 apartments.</seg>
<seg id="23">In order to prevent this, according to planning spokesperson Nicole Palm, pending ties should now be purchased from the city.</seg>
<seg id="24">In addition, it would have to be rethought to bring apartments back to the price binding.</seg>
<seg id="25">This is possible in the western city.</seg>
<seg id="26">The problem could be solved at one stroke.</seg>
<seg id="27">Because in the western city of the year-end Fristen is running.</seg>
<seg id="28">Around 1800 apartments could be brought back to the price binding for cheap apartments.</seg>
<seg id="29">Only: this is what the owners, the housing associations, do not want.</seg>
<seg id="30">Because the number of social housing in the western city is drastically increased, one is away from the goal of so-called mixing.</seg>
<seg id="31">There should be no more concentration of socially disadvantaged neighbourhoods in just a few districts.</seg>
<seg id="32">The Greens expect that there will be movement in the discussion.</seg>
<seg id="33">"" "" "" "vice-president Holger Herlitschke says:" "" "" "" "for a broad majority, the CDU must go into the boat." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="1">Pokémon Go, a hunt for health and luck, which is worthwhile</seg>
<seg id="2">It is fascinating to see how the world changes.</seg>
<seg id="3">The fact that teenagers and children are no longer going outside, but rather prefer spending their spare time on screens has been lamented by many in the last decade.</seg>
<seg id="4">Pokemon Go is about getting people out of the sofa and getting more active.</seg>
<seg id="5">The time on the screen was initially on the TV, then video games and finally limited to smartphones.</seg>
<seg id="6">That's why it's great to see that technology and outdoor activities don't exclude each other.</seg>
<seg id="7">Of course I refer to the Pokémon Go-Wahn, an app based on characters created first for video games in the 1990s (later created a cartoon series, playing cards and other spin-offs).</seg>
<seg id="8">Like many pop culture phenomena, the interest in the release of the game in the USA, Australia and New Zealand declined in early July.</seg>
<seg id="9">The market launch in other countries was postponed by the massive demand that the servers overloaded.</seg>
<seg id="10">Within a few days, Pokémon Go had more users than Tinder and almost as many as Twitter.</seg>
<seg id="11">How does it work?</seg>
<seg id="12">In short, players go outside with their smartphones and look for Pokemon, which will be tracked with a GPS and, once found, "photographed" (via a screenshot on the mobile) or "captured."</seg>
<seg id="13">A generation that played the game when she was younger, joined the Wahn and jumped for the search of the sofa.</seg>
<seg id="14">In the US, the game led to a considerable increase in steps that put the average person back every day.</seg>
<seg id="15">Cardiff, an Apple Watch app that tracked 35,000 users, recently announced that within two days of market launch, the number of people persecuted, who exercise every day 30 minutes, jumped from 45 percent to 53 percent.</seg>
<seg id="16">The company does not know who is playing Pokémon Go - it only sees raw data to increase performance.</seg>
<seg id="17">Many public awareness campaigns on health that people want to take "take 30 minutes" to "come off the sofa" and "be active every day" hit deaf ears because many public messages are boring for health and come from people who look miserable.</seg>
<seg id="18">Nevertheless, the importance of sports cannot be overvalued.</seg>
<seg id="19">Anyone who drives sports regularly reduces his chances of suffering from cancer or depression.</seg>
<seg id="20">Physical activity helps in weight control, high blood pressure, diabetes and a long list of benefits that are too long to lead them here.</seg>
<seg id="21">But the wonderful thing about Pokémon Go is that it brings people to do something in the open that makes them fun.</seg>
<seg id="22">Three pillars of health are covered - movement, fresh air and sunshine as well as fun.</seg>
<seg id="23">Some people even close new friendships on the hunt.</seg>
<seg id="24">As always there are also blackish game spoons, who always have to complain about something.</seg>
<seg id="25">And yes, someone could run against a door.</seg>
<seg id="26">What should it do?</seg>
<seg id="27">A breakthrough occurred.</seg>
<seg id="28">Even if smartphone apps like Fitbit were able to track up our activity earlier, they gave us no reason to play sports as this game does.</seg>
<seg id="29">The new will lose its appeal and use it with time.</seg>
<seg id="30">However, due to Pokemons's success, there will be more games that will unite apps and virtual reality with the active ones in the real world and help many people on the hunt to be more active, fitter and healthier.</seg>

<seg id="17">It awaited them with a final exam in Brazil, a competition not so much between Biles and the rest of the athletes, but rather between it and a load of oversized expectations.</seg>

<seg id="2">According to police reports published on Thursday, two women and a 12-year old girl were shot who died in one of the deadliest attacks since a decade in the first serial killer attack by Phoenix, while listening to the car and listening to music.</seg>
<seg id="3">Angela Rochelle Liner, Stefanie R. Ellis and Ellis daughter Maleah were shot on 12 June, while the car was parked in an entry, the authorities said.</seg>

<seg id="5">The police said that the threefold murder did not seem to have been the result of a predator, as the aggressor did not take the handbags or the $2,900 in possession of one of the adult victims.</seg>
<seg id="6">The police spokesman of Phoenix Sgt. Jonathan Howard said that the shootings lead the investigators to take a closer look at whether they are associated with four previous attacks.</seg>

<seg id="10">Investigators refused to expose the evidence that led them to the conclusion that the attacks were linked and committed by the same murderer.</seg>
<seg id="11">Ellis, 33, was hospitalized due to her injuries and died later.</seg>
<seg id="12">Liner, 31, and Ellis daughter Maleah died locally.</seg>
<seg id="13">A witness told the police that it was not unusual for them to sit in a parked car and listen to music.</seg>

<seg id="2">Heavy rainfalls and large-scale flooding in Louisiana forced the governor to call out the emergency stand on Friday.</seg>
<seg id="3">Numerous rivers in the southeast of Louisiana and the south of the Mississippi river flooded its banks and threatened with large flooding after extreme rainfalls, reported the National Weather Service.</seg>
<seg id="4">The governor of Louisiana John Bel Edwards said that state officials are in constant contact with local authorities and are already on their way to the affected communities.</seg>
<seg id="5">Mike Steele, a spokesman for the Office of Homeland Security and Emergency Preparedness of the Governors, announced that the requests for flood vessels, boats and sand bags were multiplied.</seg>
<seg id="6">Steele said that the municipality of Tangipahoa alone claimed tens of thousands of sand bags.</seg>
<seg id="7">A flood warning system is used across large parts in southern Louisiana to Saturday.</seg>
<seg id="8">The weather forecast dropped that additional 3 to 5 inches may drop in this area.</seg>
<seg id="9">In the south of Alabama there was a flood warning system on Friday, while it continued to rain in the Mobile area.</seg>
<seg id="10">The River Comite close to Baton Rouges and the River Amite near Denham Springs, both located in Louisiana, will probably reach record levels over the weekend.</seg>
<seg id="11">The metereologist Alek Krautmann says that both rivers could flood many houses near the nearby Baton Rouge.</seg>
<seg id="12">He also said that a downstream flood in Ascension Parish poses a danger, as these streams flow only slowly into Lake Maurepas via the trodden rivers.</seg>
<seg id="13">The river Tickfaw, south of the Mississippi state border in Liverpool, Louisiana, reached the highest level ever recorded on Friday at 09.00.</seg>
<seg id="14">Rescue teams still plucked people out of the flood waters in the districts of Amite and Wilkinson in the southwest of Mississippi.</seg>
<seg id="15">Leroy Hansford, his wife and his stepson were among those who were saved on Friday near Globe.</seg>
<seg id="16">Hansford, 62, says that water from Beaver Creek, which is normally more than 400 feet away from his house, has increased overnight.</seg>
<seg id="17">He said that another stepson who lives nearby would have warned him.</seg>
<seg id="18">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "we woke up and the water flowed and poured in," "" "" "" "Hansford said." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="19">It reached my waist.</seg>
<seg id="20">His wife said Hansford had never seen such a high level of river in the 48 years she lived there.</seg>
<seg id="21">Hansford said he and his family members had all the handicaps and he was the only one who can swim.</seg>
<seg id="22">Hansford said that Nothelfer had saved all three in a large military truck and would have brought them to the next fire station in Globe, where they stayed until Friday.</seg>
<seg id="23">Krautmann said that the flooding was "spreading rapidly," as there were still heavy rainfalls and that the authorities considered evacuation instructions.</seg>
<seg id="24">According to Krautmann, an observer announced in the vicinity of Livingstone from midnight to Friday morning of 13.75 inches of rain.</seg>
<seg id="25">Krautmann said that the rain has been considerably more balanced due to rainfall since Wednesday.</seg>
<seg id="26">The authorities stated that heavy rains and flooding caused the rescuing of inhabitants from their homes in Tangipahoa Parish and classroom expulsion in five school districts.</seg>
<seg id="27">The CBS subsidiary WWL reported that an orderly in Tangipahoa attacked 200 houses.</seg>
<seg id="28">The inhabitants were evacuated in two churches, both flooded now.</seg>
<seg id="29">The Chief Apostle of the commune of Robby Miller said that the authorities saved 72 people and seven pets that were washed by the floods.</seg>
<seg id="30">In the towns of Amite and Hammond, emergency shelters were set up to house the evacuees.</seg>

<seg id="1">Mahaj Brown, 6, "pierced by bullets," survives shooting in Philadelphia</seg>
<seg id="2">The police report that the 6-year-old boy was shot in Philadelphia this week already the second time that a 6 year old child is shot.</seg>
<seg id="3">The grandparents of the boy identified him for CBS Philadelphia as Mahaj Brown.</seg>
<seg id="4">The grandparents stated that Brown suffered several bullet breaches, including in the loin, leg, arm and abdomen, but that he was in hospital with his transport.</seg>
<seg id="5">"he has gone through a lot, his little body was riddled by bullets," his grandmother Delores Melchisz shared with the transmitter.</seg>
<seg id="6">I can't believe it.</seg>
<seg id="7">The condition of the boy was classified as critical in a hospital and he had to undergo several operations.</seg>
<seg id="8">The boy's family told the station that it is likely to recover again.</seg>
<seg id="9">He should have started the first class in a local primary school.</seg>
<seg id="10">Brown was one of four people who were shot in Germantown.</seg>
<seg id="11">Three men were also shot: two at the age of 29 and a 32-year-old.</seg>
<seg id="12">One of the 29-year-old men is in critical condition; the other two victims are in a stable state according to CBS Philadelphia.</seg>
<seg id="13">The boy was found on the front seat of a car together with the 29-year-old, who is in a critical state, shot at, reports the transmitter.</seg>
<seg id="14">The other two victims were not in the car and the police were investigating whether one of the injured men could be the perpetrators.</seg>
<seg id="15">Investigators told CBS Philadelphia that apparently there had come to a crossfire between several shooters.</seg>
<seg id="16">Cartridge sleeves for assault rifles, which were traced back to various assault rifles, sunk the scene of crime.</seg>
<seg id="17">It seems that this is clearly a lasting struggle.</seg>
<seg id="18">On the road, on both sides of the walkway, there were sleeves.</seg>
<seg id="19">So there seems to have been several armed fighters who were very active involved, "said police detachment Anthony Ginaldi of the police in Philadelphia to the transmitter.</seg>
<seg id="20">There were also several houses and vehicles in the area.</seg>
<seg id="21">There was no arrest and the police reportedly reviewed the surveillance video.</seg>
<seg id="22">On Tuesday, another 6-year-old girl was met by a cricket on her arm, when she played in front of her house in the residential area of West Oak Lane.</seg>
<seg id="23">She recovers herself and the police are still looking for a suspect.</seg>

<seg id="1">Why we need Simone, Gabby and Laurie</seg>
<seg id="2">That is what I imagine under the Women's olympionship in the gymnastics and that for more than one reason.</seg>
<seg id="3">First, I joined every summer Olympics since 1984 and the USA have never been so dominant.</seg>
<seg id="4">And secondly: this team has three gymnasts, Simone Biles, Gabby Douglas and Lauren "Laurie" Hernandez, who had inspired many young girls of other skin color.</seg>
<seg id="5">The structure of this team, the Aly Raisman, the Jewess and Madison Kocian, who is Catholics, makes everybody proud.</seg>
<seg id="6">This team finally mirrors the USA.</seg>
<seg id="7">It has solidified the black and hispanic female presence at the top of this sport.</seg>
<seg id="8">In the last four years, the number one female female gymnast was an Afro-American woman.</seg>
<seg id="9">Last year Simone and Gabby # 1 and # 2 were.</seg>
<seg id="10">This shows strength.</seg>
<seg id="11">At the last Olympic Games, Gabby Douglas celebrated a surprising Olympic winner and America.</seg>
<seg id="12">Now the world was able to witness the incredible achievement of the triple world world champion Simone Biles, Douglas and Laurie Hernandez, how they delivered unexpected but masterful gyms.</seg>
<seg id="13">On Thursday Simone became the fourth, heterosexual American woman who won Gold at an individual multi-campaign event.</seg>
<seg id="14">Team member Aly Raisman won silver.</seg>
<seg id="15">We experience the top of this type of sport, but gymnasiums in the whole country do not look like this.</seg>
<seg id="16">Simone, Gabby and Laurie all beat the same way as Aly and Madison to get it into the Olympic team.</seg>
<seg id="17">They are the "Last Five," because the next Olympic team will only have four gymnasts in the team. in addition, this is the last year with Marta Karolyi as a trainer.</seg>
<seg id="18">But the reality is that gymnastics are an expensive sport, and Turner is primarily involved in private gymnastics, which are maintained by parents who pay for the training, training, travel, clothing, competition and hotel costs (for the trainers and their gymnasts and families).</seg>
<seg id="19">The majority of these turntables lie in affluent suburbs, which can support the business.</seg>
<seg id="20">In these clubs, the gymnasts receive their entire training and this is an expensive and long-term engagement for the families.</seg>
<seg id="21">Aimee Boorman, trainer of Simone Biles, and Maggie Haney, trainer of Laurie Hernandez, have trained both her athletes since they started the gymnastics.</seg>
<seg id="22">We have to give the municipalities aun countless, young girls, who are inspired by Simone, Gabby and Laurie, a more affordable and easy-to-reach exercise coach.</seg>
<seg id="23">I founded my gymnastics foundation for 20 years.</seg>
<seg id="24">At my events we have offered free and affordable gymnastics in Harlem for more than 15,000 urban youngsters (especially black and hispanic) and trained national and international winners.</seg>
<seg id="25">In September we will expand to Detroit (my hometown) to offer the youth high-quality gymnastics, which deserve the opportunity to learn and benefit from this great Olympic sport.</seg>
<seg id="26">Gymnastics develop strength, flexibility and coordination for the body as well as hard work, discipline and determination for the mind.</seg>
<seg id="27">This combination offers lifelong benefits for health as well as for academic and professional success.</seg>
<seg id="28">It is the inspiration of this team that can bring thousands of young girls to be interested in gymnastics and that's great.</seg>
<seg id="29">It is so important to participate in sports, especially for girls.</seg>
<seg id="30">This is such an exciting time.</seg>
<seg id="31">Thanks Simone, Aly, Laurie, Gabby and Madison for this real representation of "Girl Power" by holding the Olympic team golden and thank you, so many young girls with varying backgrounds motivated her to start her way to become healthy, strong and successful young women.</seg>

<seg id="1">Assistant physicians would like to organize other strikes after rejecting Jeremy Hunts's proposal</seg>
<seg id="2">The ministers had hoped to end the dispute over the changes by accepting a reformed treaty with the officials of the British Medical Association, but 58 percent of the 37,000 resident physicians who voted in favor rejected him.</seg>
<seg id="3">In July Hunt announced plans to forcibly introduce the treaty and said that the NHS would be found in a "Niemandsland" and that any further delay would be harmful to the employees and patients.</seg>
<seg id="4">The first resident physicians should receive a new contract that includes changes to night and weekend supplements to improve care at times of times.</seg>
<seg id="5">Dr Ellen McCourt, the chairwoman of the BMA Committee for Assistants told last night in a message with: "assistants have still serious concerns on the proposed contract, in particular that it will heat up the current staff crisis and it will be used to treat all doctors just."</seg>
<seg id="6">With only eight weeks remaining until the first group of doctors fall under the new contract, progress must be made and time runs out.</seg>
<seg id="7">Efforts on the part of the BMA to resolve disputes were met by the government on reluctance and sometimes on deafening silence.</seg>
<seg id="8">This was the result of a promise that Jeremy Hunt had made over the last month that his door would always be open.</seg>
<seg id="9">Jeremy Hunt has to act now, raise the lift and address the cares of the resident doctors. "</seg>
<seg id="10">If he does not do this, the assistance physicians have made it clear that they are prepared to carry out further work combat measures.</seg>
<seg id="11">The last strike at the end of April saw a surge of nearly 13,000 routine operations and 100,000 appointments, as nurses and veterinarians were included to provide medical doctors on the strike chain.</seg>
<seg id="12">The ministers had hoped to end the dispute over the changes by accepting the reformed contract with the officials of the British Medical Association.</seg>
<seg id="13">The BMA wants a better week pay for the 54,000 assistance physicians who are subject to the contract.</seg>
<seg id="14">Daniel Mortimer, General Director of NHS employees, called on the assistance physicians to stop the strike.</seg>
<seg id="15">Mortimer said: "work combat measures do not achieve anything, but have already overloaded teams and service providers and prepare patients, nurses and their families only concerns, need and break."</seg>
<seg id="16">Over the past two months, we have talked to the Committee of Assistants and responded positively to the health ministry as well as other ministries on concerns regarding guardianship and whistleblower.</seg>
<seg id="17">The employers hoped that continued positive engagement on other important topics - such as posting, flexibility in training, training courses, mutual recognition of the curriculum, training holidays and gender pay gap in medicine - were a sign of how serious it was the employers, the Health Education England and the Ministry of Health regarding compliance with the agreements with the BMA in November, February and May.</seg>

<seg id="7">Around 140,000 people suffer from a heart attack every year and a quarter of them suffer another heart attack or stroke.</seg>
<seg id="8">Heart attacks and strokes are caused by accumulations of fatty tissue in the artery walls that form coverings.</seg>
<seg id="9">When the floorcovering breaks apart, it can cause a blood clots that clogged the blood flow to the heart, causing a heart attack.</seg>

<seg id="11">Individuals who have already had a heart attack are subject to a higher risk of having another heart attack.</seg>
<seg id="12">Ticagrelor, produced by the British company AstraZeneca and marketed under the trade name Brixeneca, reduces this risk by making the formation of blood clots more improbable.</seg>
<seg id="13">The introduction of NICE, published today, recommends a 12 month intake of 90mg Ticagrelor, followed by 60mg with a twice daily intake of aspirin for the next three years.</seg>
<seg id="14">Professor Carole Longson, Director of the NICE Health Technology Assessment Center said: "despite the availability of secondary prevention, a quarter of all persons having a heart attack have another heart attack or stroke - often with disastrous consequences."</seg>
<seg id="15">The fear of a renewed heart attack can have significant negative effects on the quality of life of a person.</seg>
<seg id="16">Experience shows that Ticagrelor in combination with aspirin is effective in reducing further heart attacks and strokes in people who have already had a heart attack.</seg>
<seg id="17">With a preliminary recommendation from Ticagrelor, we are pleased that we are able to extend available treatment options to thousands of people who can benefit from it.</seg>
<seg id="18">The information on the efficacy and safety of Ticagrelor - especially the risk of bleeding - is limited to a period of up to three years.</seg>

<seg id="2">The former mayor of Tower Hamlets Lutfur Rahman was removed last year due to corruption from office</seg>
<seg id="3">A culture of political rectness has led to the fact that widespread electoral fraud in Muslim communities is unknowingly ignored as a devastating government report today revealed.</seg>
<seg id="4">The former cabinet member Sir Eric Pickles verbally attacks the police, election observers and city halls for ignoring evidence of misuse due to "hypersensitivity to ethnicity and religion."</seg>

<seg id="13">Last year, a special district court ruled that the incumbent mayor Luton Rahman should be relieved after a litany of corrupt and illegal practice of his ministry.</seg>

<seg id="19">Sir Eric, pictured, made several recommendations to clean up the electoral system, including guiding leasings to prove the identity</seg>
<seg id="20">In his report it says: "as proof was appropriate that pressure on vulnerable members of some ethnic minorities was carried out, especially women and young people, in order to choose according to the will of the elderly, in particular communities with Pakistan or Bangladesian background.</seg>

<seg id="2">The world outside is a dangerous place, but this video of Dailymail.com could make it a little safer for you.</seg>
<seg id="3">We talked to Rhon Mizrachi, a Grand Master of the Krav Maga Association in New York to find out how to deal with armed robbers at a close distance.</seg>
<seg id="4">Regardless of whether you approach you from the front or from the back, this video will show you how to turn the spear around for your robber.</seg>
<seg id="5">If you approach you from behind, then you should turn around as first, so that you can see your aggressor and go out of the line, "says Mizrachi.</seg>
<seg id="6">Then take the weapon between your forearm and your shoulder before hitting it with your free elbows.</seg>
<seg id="7">Beat him with his knee in the bar and twist while the Attacker curbs from pain, the weapon from his hands. beat him with the run into the face and move backwards while they direct the weapon on it.</seg>
<seg id="8">For attackers who approach from the front, the technique is similar - move your body out of the line, grab the gun and twist it so that the attacker can't shoot.</seg>
<seg id="9">Shift the weight to the weapon at the same time and beat the Attacker to the chest, then turn the weapon out of its grip before moving backwards and straighten the weapon on it.</seg>
<seg id="10">Sounds difficult?</seg>

<seg id="1">Traveler Ian Wright schabt for a travel guide his tongue at the dirtiest places in Europe</seg>
<seg id="2">A British traveller underlined his immune system and perfector of a serious trial by detecting some of the dirtiest and disgusting places in Europe.</seg>
<seg id="3">The moderator and travel author Ian Wright, 51, from Suffolk abdicated his course on a euro note, a banister at Piccadilly Circus, a flush button of a draw toilet and a public phone in Russia to prove the resilience of his immune system.</seg>
<seg id="4">Before checking every object, he used a luminometer to show himself and to show us what he will get involved.</seg>
<seg id="5">But the experiment, filmed under the title "The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength," brought some surprising results to daylight.</seg>
<seg id="6">The idea to check the flush button of a draw toilet, which has already been used by thousands of others, may be completely repulsive, but in fact there are more bad bacteria in a kitchen sink.</seg>
<seg id="7">On his journey through Europe, Mr. Wright spoke to doctors and medical professionals about the promotion of gut bacteria as well as about his own health.</seg>
<seg id="8">Fortunately left nothing that he had tasted, more than a bad aftertaste in the mouth.</seg>
<seg id="9">Mr. Wright was known to test the resistance of his intestine by traveling through the world and ate odd as well as wonderful things.</seg>
<seg id="10">From public banisters to stations to flush toilets of toilets, the task assigned its immune system definitely among a sample</seg>
<seg id="11">In the film he told me: "as a child I was relatively unconcerned about my health and I put all sorts of things in my mouth, earth, worms and mud water."</seg>
<seg id="12">In the film, he did justice to his reputation.</seg>
<seg id="13">The only thing he refused was a dirty public toilet in Russia.</seg>
<seg id="14">His test finish showed a luminometer rating of more than 4000 units.</seg>
<seg id="15">Compared to this, the luminometric number of freshly washed hands is less than 60.</seg>
<seg id="16">But there was a Russian toilet he refused to deem after its luminometer rating was over 4000 units while freshly washed hands have less than 60 units.</seg>
<seg id="17">Mr. Wright and Finnish manufacturer of dairy products Valio produced the travel film "The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength," which shows the number of bacteria in different places like the bathroom</seg>
<seg id="18">"" "" "" "in the film, he says:" "" "" "" "this comes close to the worst that I had smelled in a toilet." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="19">There is nothing worse than that!</seg>
<seg id="20">I will not check out here because it is disgusting here.</seg>
<seg id="21">"the Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength" was produced in collaboration with the Finnish manufacturer of dairy products Valio.</seg>
<seg id="22">The company equips Mr. Wright with Valio Gefilus, which contains lactic acid bacteria as well as vitamin C and D to support the promotion of intestinal bacteria and immune system.</seg>
<seg id="23">Valios Senior Vice President for snacks, juices and new categories Niko Vuorenmaa says: "we really wanted to offer consumers something new.</seg>
<seg id="24">Something that is fascinating to look at and at the same time explains the advantages of probiotics.</seg>
<seg id="25">"" "" "" "we conducted crazy brainstorming that ended that we said" "" "" "" "Let us call us Ian." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="26">They claim that the interest in intestinal health is becoming a global phenomenon</seg>
<seg id="27">Instead of talking about products, we wanted to put them in a greater context - the good and bad bacteria in our everyday environment, the importance of gut health and how it is linked to the immune system.</seg>
<seg id="28">Growing interest in gut health is a global phenomenon and with the documentary we were able to provide consumers with more information in an interesting way.</seg>
<seg id="29">I also think the film shows that we have a great sense of humor!</seg>
<seg id="30">Tom Hakala, who directed the film, added: "let me tell you - I would have lost my respect for Ian if he had tasted some of the things I had ordered him to lick, like the disgusting Russian toilet that is shown in the film."</seg>
<seg id="31">Of course there were things in which it was easier to get Ian to check them and others where it was pretty difficult.</seg>
<seg id="32">"" "" "" "I'm glad that we recorded some of these dirty goodies on film." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="33">In a survey conducted by Valio in 2015, 84 percent of all respondents reported lactic acid bacteria, especially with the well-being of stomach and intestines and 58 percent said that they have at least occasionally used products containing lactic acid bacteria.</seg>

<seg id="2">An asocial family left her social apartment after a delogiation with a loss of £50,000 because she had terrorized her neighbors.</seg>
<seg id="3">Tanya Skeldon and her partner Shaun Trebilbie were thrown after a long list of complaints from her estate in Saltash, Cornwall.</seg>
<seg id="4">After being forcibly removed from their property, shocked employees of the housing cooperative found the property in an irreparable state.</seg>
<seg id="5">The walls had gaping holes, wooden planks were torn up, rubbish was scattered on the floor and graffiti was smeared on the walls.</seg>
<seg id="6">The family has been resettled and it is believed that it now lives in a private accommodation</seg>
<seg id="7">Donna McEvoy, who works for the property management at Cornwall Housing, said that she was afraid that the apartment was no longer repaired.</seg>
<seg id="8">"" "" "" "she said," "" "" "" "It was an absolute nightmare for the people and I think people don't have to live in this way." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="9">There are many things to consider since this property is probably considered to be not as beautiful part of Cornwall.</seg>
<seg id="10">The family is notorious and their reputation is also.</seg>
<seg id="11">The couple had three sons who lived in the apartment in the meantime and the police said that the terror that the family had added, street fights with baseball slurry, intimidation by residents, drug abuse, drug trafficking and excessive screaming, quarrels and floods.</seg>
<seg id="12">Skeldon, 47, whose name was on the lease, got an arrangement for anti-social behaviour in June.</seg>
<seg id="13">In some rooms of the house, which may be torn down under certain circumstances, old garbage was found</seg>
<seg id="14">In the estate, where drugs were traded in the past, the wooden legs were ripped open</seg>
<seg id="15">Neighbors said they had to fight them on the street and regularly called the police.</seg>
<seg id="16">Cornwall Housing gave her and her partner this week violently by the property after giving them an extended period of 11 weeks to volunteer.</seg>
<seg id="17">The delogiation was cheered by neighbours that said their lives were made hell.</seg>
<seg id="18">"" "" "" "one said," "" "" "" "They didn't care about anyone." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="19">We lived 20 years beside them and it was always bad.</seg>

<seg id="22">We stood up because it was so quiet here - we are not used to it!</seg>
<seg id="23">Now, where they are finally gone, it will be nice.</seg>
<seg id="24">Adam Fitzpatrick, Neighbourhood Enforcement Manager of Cornwall Housing, said it would have abused family with local authorities.</seg>
<seg id="25">The family lived in the house where the police were called at regular intervals for 20 years.</seg>
<seg id="26">On the overgrown side of the Municipal House, garbage and old toys were thrown down</seg>
<seg id="27">He added, "It is a shame that the tenant would have agreed to accept any responsibility for their behaviour and family, as a deletion is always the final step that Cornwall Housing takes into account.</seg>
<seg id="28">This was a very difficult case, because the behavior was extreme and their actions for their neighbours had to be horrible.</seg>
<seg id="29">I appreciate all the work that my team, the police of Devon and Cornwall, as well as members of the community who have courageously approached us and have given us the information.</seg>
<seg id="30">I hope that this development will give comfort to some neighbors and that the message conveys that anti-social behaviour is not tolerated.</seg>
<seg id="31">Fitzpatrick said that all three sons had lived in the house at different times, but that they were all over 20.</seg>
<seg id="32">A dirty mattress that is left in one of the bedrooms of the house after the deletion on the ground.</seg>
<seg id="33">Housekeeping workers will now have to leave rubbish mountains that surround the house</seg>
<seg id="34">In 2014, the police conducted a raid in the house and found over 70g of cannabis as well as balances, parapheralia and cash in the amount of £1,700.</seg>
<seg id="35">Skeldon received a fine after having found himself guilty of owning a class B drug in commercial intent.</seg>
<seg id="36">She claimed that the money was for a tombstone of her son Lee Skeldon, who died in 2013 in a car accident.</seg>
<seg id="37">After they were without shelter, it is assumed that Tanya and their partner are now living in a private accommodation in Plymouth.</seg>
<seg id="38">Many of the walls of the house were graffiti.</seg>
<seg id="39">The police say that they will navigate tenants who do not stick to the house rules</seg>
<seg id="40">Angela Crow by the police of Devon and Cornwall informed that the expulsion was a clear warning to the other tenants who do not abide by the house rules.</seg>
<seg id="41">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "this goes to those who think they can behave without self-reproach and those who were harmed by such a behaviour," "" "" "" "she said." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="2">The IOC wants to set up a disciplinary committee on the case.</seg>
<seg id="3">Kenya's athletes are facing the second doping affair at the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro.</seg>
<seg id="4">After a fraud control in the Olympic Village, Kenya sent a trainer back home.</seg>
<seg id="5">The International Olympic Committee decided to promptly set up a disciplinary committee in order to investigate the case.</seg>
<seg id="6">A Kenyan functionary reported that the former Sprinter and present coach, John Anzrah, gave a urine sample in the Olympic village under the name of the 800-metre-runner Ferguson Rotich.</seg>
<seg id="7">This was reported to the team leadership of Kenya by the doping inspectors.</seg>
<seg id="8">The IAAF World Association has asked the IOC for information about the case in order to exert its own investigations, an IAAF spokesperson stated.</seg>
<seg id="9">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "depending on the results of the investigation and the subsequent measures of the IOC, the IAAF will evaluate an assessment," "" "" "" "said it in an IAAF account." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="10">"he (Anzrah) has gone to the Doping control station and has spent himself as Ferguson Red, handed out and signed the test," said Kenya's Head of Mission Stephan Arap Soi.</seg>
<seg id="11">He was in possession of the accreditation of the athletes standing on the list for training controls of the World Anti-Doping agency.</seg>
<seg id="12">Ferguson Red had become more than 800 meters in Beijing in 2015.</seg>
<seg id="13">Four days earlier, the Turkish Athletics Heads of Heads, Michael Rotich, had been drafted by the Rio Games.</seg>
<seg id="14">He is said to have informed athletes of his country about upcoming doping tests.</seg>
<seg id="15">According to media reports, he was reported to have been arrested at his return to Nairobi's airport.</seg>
<seg id="16">Kenya is already under special observation at the IOC after numerous doping offences.</seg>
<seg id="17">In the announcement of the more than 2000 Doping target controls submitted by the IOC before the Rio Games, it was strangely noted that especially athletes from Kenya and Russia were targeted.</seg>
<seg id="18">Before the summer Olympics in Brazil, the World Anti-Doping agency had exerted a lot of pressure on the African country to create an anti-doping law and a functioning control system.</seg>
<seg id="19">The law was adopted a few weeks before the commencement of the Olympics.</seg>
<seg id="20">As a result, WADA Kenya accepted from the list of countries whose doping control is compliant with the rules of WADA.</seg>
<seg id="21">Kenya is considered a great runner-nation.</seg>
<seg id="22">The athletes of the country won most medals at the World Cup 2015 in Beijing.</seg>
<seg id="23">In a series of TV reports of the ARD, allegations were repeatedly raised that doping agents are easily accessible in Kenya and there should be a considerable mentality of sport fraud.</seg>
<seg id="24">IOC member Richard Pound recently called for a similar investigation in Kenya as he had hired her in Russian athletics.</seg>
<seg id="25">In doing so, it was possible to prove that this type of sport has been systematically and systematically suppressed.</seg>
<seg id="26">Russia's athletes were then excluded from the summer games.</seg>

<seg id="1">"" "" "" "Salzburg" "" "" "" "West Side Story" "" "" "" "with Cecilia Bartoli</seg>
<seg id="2">In the Shakespeare-Year, the Salzburg Festival presents the "West Side Story" with Tony and Maria as a tragic love couple, similar to Romeo and Juliet.</seg>
<seg id="3">With a surprising Cecilia Bartoli.</seg>
<seg id="4">A musical conquers Salzburg: the "West Side Story," Leornard Bernsteins masterpiece.</seg>
<seg id="5">The artistic director Cecilia Bartoli wanted to bring the musical into the temple of classical music and fulfilled herself with the role of Maria a teenage mare.</seg>
<seg id="6">In the orchestra pit the Simón Bolívar Orchestra under the direction of the Venezuelan conductor Gustavo Dudamel: "this music is full of rhythm," he warms.</seg>
<seg id="7">We always say that it is very Latin American.</seg>
<seg id="8">There are many Latin American ingredients in their tempo and melody.</seg>
<seg id="9">It is a wonderful mixture, the perfect recipe for our orchestra.</seg>
<seg id="10">I would say that we really have Bernstein's music in our blood!</seg>
<seg id="11">In this staging, Bartoli plays an older Mary.</seg>
<seg id="12">She recalls with nostalgia of her love with Tony while the younger Maria is playing and dancing.</seg>
<seg id="13">The role of Mary has always fascinated me.</seg>
<seg id="14">First, because it is musically exceptional!</seg>
<seg id="15">And then there would be Maria's personality.</seg>
<seg id="16">She says it in her song: "I feel pretty, oh so pretty, I feel pretty and witty and bright."</seg>
<seg id="17">So it is wise, of course also naïve, and very passionate.</seg>
<seg id="18">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "she is very similar to me, my Italian character, which I have as a Roman," "" "" "" "laughs Bartoli." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="19">Dudamel is full of praise for the opera singer: "Cecilia is a wonderful artist."</seg>
<seg id="20">It is such an honour to work with her.</seg>
<seg id="21">It is a tremendously generous person.</seg>
<seg id="22">And Bartoli returns the compliment: "Dudamel is such an exceptional artist and very passionate!"</seg>
<seg id="23">Conducting is a necessity for him.</seg>
<seg id="24">One sees it in each of his movements, in his looks, it is his life!</seg>
<seg id="25">It is such a huge chance to share this musical experience with him.</seg>
<seg id="26">We both have a rather southern temperament, a fire, a passion and also a happy approach to life, that is very important at all!</seg>
<seg id="27">For American director Philip Wm. McKinley is the "West Side Story" up-to-date: "this piece deals with prejudices and fanaticism."</seg>
<seg id="28">Today we have the refugees, at that time the Puertorians went to New York, and the New Yorkers did not want them.</seg>
<seg id="29">They are the same themes and they are just as meaningful as they were back then.</seg>
<seg id="30">59 years later, the piece is still relevant.</seg>

<seg id="1">London schoolgirl who joined the IS was killed in Syria</seg>
<seg id="2">Kadiza Sultana, one of three British schoolgirls who left London last year to join the IS, reportedly died in Syria.</seg>
<seg id="3">The lawyer Tasnime Akunjee said that her family heard about her death in Raqqa, Syria a few weeks ago.</seg>
<seg id="4">It was suspected that it was killed by a Russian air attack in Raqqa, the group's bulwark in the country, ITV news reported on Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="5">Sultana was 17 years old and, according to her family, died shortly after she pretended to leave the warmed land and return to England.</seg>
<seg id="6">"one can only hope that the only good thing lies in it - as warning and warning to others that these are the risks involved in going into a war zone - to stop people from ever making this decision," Akunjee said.</seg>
<seg id="7">In February 2015, Sultana and two other schoolgirls from the east of London went to Turkey and then into a bus to the Syrian border.</seg>
<seg id="8">Sultanas's family was told that she married an ISIS fighter in Syria and became a widow within a few months.</seg>

<seg id="1">Reid says that Clinton will remain candidates for the Supreme Court in the case of electoral victory at Garland</seg>
<seg id="2">Harry Reid, leader of the Democrats in the Senate, is convinced that the Democrats, Hillary Clinton, will nominate Hillary Clinton's judge Merrick Garland for the Supreme Court.</seg>
<seg id="3">The Republicans in the Senate have blocked Garlands's confirmation since its nomination by Barack Obama in March.</seg>
<seg id="4">The majority leader in the Senate Mitch McConnell believes that the next president will appoint the successor of the deceased judge at the Supreme Court of Antonin Scalia.</seg>

<seg id="6">A spokesperson on Reid said later that he had not yet talked with Clinton whether she would nominate Garland and speculate.</seg>

<seg id="4">At the beginning of this year, the editor-in-chief of Treats Steve Shaw told us that his neck magazine differs from oldschool playboys because "Playboy is for men."</seg>
<seg id="5">I do this for women.</seg>
<seg id="6">Apparently it is the view that it also does the calendar.</seg>
<seg id="7">"we must return to the portrayal of timeless and classical nudity, in which both women and men feel comfortable and feel inspired by these images of a female body," Shaw said in a press release for the publication of the calendar.</seg>
<seg id="8">Women will want to participate in this project because it is a beautiful work of art.</seg>
<seg id="9">Models can submit their images online or in person with open casting call in Los Angeles and New York.</seg>

<seg id="1">Mecklenburg-Vorpommern: "go where it hurts"</seg>
<seg id="2">Strange Mecklenburg-Vorpommern: the locals don't get anything from the summer campaign with - and holidaymakers from North Rhine-Westphalia are not allowed to choose the Landtag.</seg>
<seg id="3">In Mecklenburg-Vorpommern they understood.</seg>
<seg id="4">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "in 2021, the Parliament election will not take place again at the end of the summer holidays, the Schwerin Parliament has already decided at the beginning of the year." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="5">For more stupid than it hasn't been: summer holidays, heat and country elections - that bites.</seg>
<seg id="6">The locals, who want to be convinced by the electoral militants, are on vacation.</seg>
<seg id="7">Most of the vacationers in the country, on Usedom, Rügen or Hiddensee are not locals, so don't choose the Landtag.</seg>
<seg id="8">There are also practical problems: during holidays, helpers who hang up posters, inflate balloons, distribute flyers and enumerate votes in the end, only painstakingly apply.</seg>
<seg id="9">Until September 4, 2016, the last day of the election and last holiday day, Mecklenburg-Vorpommern has once again contested its election campaign on the people.</seg>
<seg id="10">The hot phase, if one can say that at all, has just begun.</seg>
<seg id="11">And it's also about something: Prime Minister Erwin Sellering, leader of an SPD / CDU coalition, must be afraid of his office.</seg>
<seg id="12">The SPD, the strongest party since 1998, is now clearly behind the CDU in polls.</seg>
<seg id="13">Exciting is how strongly newcomer AfD cuts off and what remains at the end of coalitionalism.</seg>
<seg id="14">Sellering, 66 years old and head of government since 2008, makes an almost inconspicuous campaign, one sees from his large posters.</seg>
<seg id="15">He travels through the country, distributes roses and chats a little with the people, as he did his legendary eloquent predecessor Harald Ringstorff also.</seg>
<seg id="16">Apart from that, Seelering has got cold feet and gives Chancellor Merkel the blame on the blossoming of the AfD.</seg>
<seg id="17">Her refugee policy, her "We create that" has accelerated the rise of the right-wing populists, which will presumably cost him the beautiful ministry.</seg>
<seg id="18">The CDU with its top candidate, the interior minister Lorenz Caffier, has already experienced how it is like when you make a right place at the wrong time.</seg>
<seg id="19">She has invited chancellor Angela Merkel to major events twice; Merkel's election circuit is located in the northeast.</seg>
<seg id="20">But the target group did not agree, there were more North Rhine-Westphalia, Berlin and Saxony as Mecklenburg and Vorpommern.</seg>
<seg id="21">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "there was probably the majority from other federal states," "" "" "" "complained Vincent Kokert, Secretary General of the CDU in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, recently in NDR." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="22">But it doesn't pity anybody from other corners of Germany to listen to Angela Merkel once.</seg>
<seg id="23">Apart from that, the Northeast CDU largely dispenses with the usual campaign conditions on marketplaces and shopping malls with umbrellas and balloons.</seg>
<seg id="24">"" "" "" "that, according to Kokert, plays only a" "" "" "" "subordinate role" "" "" "". "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="25">Also the Union has noticed that on the country you are branding the base that it needs to be very strict to find a wire to the people again.</seg>
<seg id="26">You are doing it like the left, the SPD, the Greens: there is hardly any place in the expanse of the country.</seg>
<seg id="27">The Council of the CDU electoral militant Kokert on his fellow campaigners is also self-exposing: "they have to go where it hurts, namely where people are: Dorffeste, Golden Weddings, every birthday party has to be used."</seg>
<seg id="28">Because a lot is at stake, Sellering has now called its SPD to a particularly committed election campaign.</seg>
<seg id="29">In polls, the Social Democrats were last at 22 percent behind partner CDU (25) and just ahead of AfD (19).</seg>
<seg id="30">In the election of 2011, the SPD won still clearly with 35.6 percent before the CDU (22).</seg>
<seg id="31">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "the Green Party, a small party with seven percent in the polls, is likely to make the leap into parliament." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="33">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "online election campaign," "" "" "" "calls the president Claudia Müller." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="34">Otherwise, green elective warriors embark on a search for traces to local voters.</seg>

<seg id="1">B27 Renovation: restaurants suffering from blocking</seg>
<seg id="2">There is nothing to complain about the speed with which the B 27 is rehabilitated.</seg>
<seg id="3">For those responsible for the construction work, starting at 5.30 a.m. and ending at 8 p.m., there are all praise.</seg>
<seg id="4">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "they made everything quite jagged," "" "" "" "says Elvira Tetzlaff from the Jet-Gas station." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="5">This is a super team.</seg>
<seg id="6">There is no delay.</seg>
<seg id="7">At the start of the week, the construction site could be relocated to the south as planned until the end of October.</seg>
<seg id="8">Vowed will also be the arrival of those responsible for the construction work, for example when it comes to the establishment of lodging entrances.</seg>
<seg id="9">Since the construction site has migrated to the south on Monday and also the locking of the asphalt road in Ofterdingen has been abolished and thus the connection to Rottenburg is again, the traffic situation within the village has relaxed.</seg>
<seg id="10">The citizens can now leave the B 27 on both sides by Ofterdingen.</seg>
<seg id="11">The evasive way through the place seems to go back.</seg>
<seg id="12">"there were some considerable complaints," says the Deputy Head Office, Florian King, responsible for the transport management of the refurbishment.</seg>
<seg id="13">The residents of Bachstraße, Steinlachstraße, Hafnerstraße and Weiherlands had to fight with more traffic noise because many creeping paths were looking for and more familiar with their Navi than the signs.</seg>
<seg id="14">This led to a reduction in some trucks in residential areas.</seg>
<seg id="15">As the speed limits were not complied with, the municipality requested reinforcements of the Mössingen measurement vehicle.</seg>
<seg id="16">"there were significant transgressions," says King, who made himself informed about the situation.</seg>
<seg id="17">Two to three per minute have been injected.</seg>
<seg id="18">The fastest was on the road at 77 km / h in the Tempo-30 zone.</seg>
<seg id="19">Since the construction site has moved on, it has become quieter.</seg>
<seg id="20">For the business people at the B 27 it is only a small consolation that for customers from Rottenburg the street is now open.</seg>
<seg id="21">Business people don't like to look into the cards.</seg>
<seg id="22">But the fact that the B 27 rehabilitation has led to sales breakthroughs allows anyone to look through.</seg>
<seg id="23">However, some are more and some less affected.</seg>
<seg id="24">Those who have less to do with the "end customer" are produced for other companies, for whom the rehabilitation has hardly any consequences.</seg>
<seg id="25">Also at the dealership Maier, Thomas Sulz speaks of a "at most slight drop," but also concedes that of course "the runnshaft is missing."</seg>
<seg id="26">The most heavily exploited are the local restaurants along the street.</seg>
<seg id="27">J. Albert Göhner, owner of the Steakhouse, formerly crown, finds clear words.</seg>
<seg id="28">This is already existential.</seg>
<seg id="29">"" "" "" "not only him, but all the restaurants" "" "" "" "hard hit" "" "" "". "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="30">The customers were missing from Hechingen, Balingen and Rottweil.</seg>
<seg id="31">We have to be glad about every Euro turnover.</seg>
<seg id="32">"" "" "" "the revenue losses are reduced to" "" "" "" "far more than 50 percent." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="33">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "the road marking has dropped its operation" "" "" "" "for two years." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="34">He had to let half of his staff go.</seg>
<seg id="35">If I had a company with 4000 employees and half had been dismissed, politics would have reacted differently.</seg>
<seg id="36">Instead, District President Jörg Schmidt has responded to a request from Göhner, if there could be financial compensation, with the hint that the restaurant would otherwise benefit from the advantages of the situation on the B 27. now, it must also bear the disadvantages resulting from the renovation.</seg>
<seg id="37">Göhner knows from other counties, where so much more generous has been handled.</seg>
<seg id="38">With all complaints, Göhner is confident that his restaurant will continue to exist.</seg>
<seg id="39">After all, family business has been settled here since 1715, he refers to the long history.</seg>
<seg id="40">He can understand that other regular guests are less frequent due to complicated traffic management.</seg>
<seg id="41">If you can't ride, it is also somewhere else nice.</seg>
<seg id="42">Göhner has no doubt that his family clientele returns after the end of the renovation work.</seg>
<seg id="43">Despite the crises with BSE and avian influenza, Göhner considers the effects of the B 27 construction works on his clientele for the biggest crisis, which has experienced its restaurant in its long history.</seg>
<seg id="44">Six months of construction work, that's already brutal.</seg>

<seg id="17">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "these will be difficult points for the SPD," "" "" "" "concedes the CDU man." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="22">In case of divorce for rejected asylum seekers, he wants to make some even worse than before - for example those who commit crimes or deliberately throw away their documents in order to obscure their identity.</seg>
<seg id="23">Some of them are politically and legally delicate.</seg>
<seg id="24">Many things still have an impact and leave any questions open.</seg>
<seg id="25">And at some points - in the unequal treatment of patients, for example - the question arises: what does this actually have to do with security and terror?</seg>
<seg id="26">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "yes, says de Maizière," "" "" "" "it is important to differentiate between the subjects refugees and terror." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="27">But it cannot be said that the attacks were refugees from Ansbach and Würzburg.</seg>

<seg id="5">Volkswagen starts with deliveries in the second half of the year.</seg>
<seg id="6">Despite the diesel engine, Europe's largest car manufacturer can continue to show a plus despite the diesel engine thanks to its many brands and some well-running markets.</seg>
<seg id="7">But in July the core brand VW fainted above all in Western Europe and thus weighed down the total sales, as the company noted in the Dax.</seg>
<seg id="8">In July, the VW brand sold 1.8 percent less vehicles in July with 449100 cars than in the previous year's month.</seg>
<seg id="9">In Western Europe alone, after China, the second most important market, sales were 14 percent below the previous year's month.</seg>
<seg id="10">In Germany's home market, deliveries declined by almost one sixth.</seg>
<seg id="11">Market leader Jürgen Stackmann reduced the weaker figures from July mainly to two sales days less in Europe.</seg>
<seg id="12">In addition, there was a purchase reserve in some core markets through "changed economic conditions."</seg>
<seg id="13">In addition to the situation around the turkey test in Turkey, the British vote also burdened the exit from the EU, explained a spokeswoman.</seg>
<seg id="14">In the USA, where the exhaust air was first calibrated, a minus is also available.</seg>
<seg id="15">Great support for VW is the Chinese market.</seg>
<seg id="16">All in all, the mainly affected domestic brand of Lower Saxony is still further worsened by the diesel scandal: after the first seven months, only an extradition minus of 0.9 percent is expected to increase to 3.37 million vehicles.</seg>
<seg id="17">Group sales manager Fred Kappler was able to present a sales increase from January to July.</seg>
<seg id="18">At this time, Volkswagen delivered 1.3 percent more vehicles, around 5,904 million worldwide.</seg>
<seg id="19">Volkswagen had been manipulating gas tests with a software.</seg>
<seg id="20">In Germany alone, VW is calling for some 2.5 million vehicles to upgrade to the workshops.</seg>

<seg id="31">Volkswagen himself uses the term "guarantee" but not as it was called in corporate circles.</seg>
<seg id="32">With the wide term "warranty," Volkswagen sees the possibility that for example, customers can come to a workshop for example half a year after the conversion - and this could lead to the new software, even if the damage has nothing to do with it.</seg>
<seg id="33">Also in the interest of customers it is important to avoid any other damages which have nothing to do with the exhaust gas scandal, as regards possible warranty regulations, as it was said.</seg>
<seg id="34">Therefore VW does not use the term "guarantee."</seg>

<seg id="1">Destination Boards: who's buying records?</seg>
<seg id="2">Lonely middle-aged men love plates.</seg>
<seg id="3">Before commenting to the comment section, in order to conceal it under the pseudonym of non-avenue of men's middle-aged men with harsh insults, this statement derives from actual data.</seg>
<seg id="4">According to YouGov, the many-discussed resurgence of records cannot be attributed to a boom in millennials, who want to welcome the news of physical objects, but to Midlife nostalgia.</seg>
<seg id="5">Those who recently bought a record are all foresight between 45 and 54.</seg>
<seg id="6">In fact, the age group of 18-24 is the most likely buyer group.</seg>
<seg id="7">There is also no hordes by hobby collectors - it has an emotional meaning: older record buyers rather keep their feelings for themselves (56% vs. 53%) and enjoy spending time alone (69% vs. 66%).</seg>
<seg id="8">But do the results of YouGov match?</seg>
<seg id="9">If this blog is a news report on TV, the camera would follow me while I run in the middle of a busy street in Soho, wear a modest grey suit and roar wildly before I stop, keep my hands and say something more intimate like: "so let's take a closer look at it."</seg>
<seg id="10">So, let's take a look at it.</seg>
<seg id="11">Even though the heart of Soho slowly stands in its charm - hotels, restaurants and offices are now filling the buildings in which once independent sellers were located - there is still a handful of fantastic plate specialty shops.</seg>
<seg id="12">I would probably ask the cameraman to switch the camera off for the next part in which I stand in close proximity to various men in such stores and try to judge their age and mind through observation.</seg>
<seg id="13">Stuart from Glasgow, 55, I am from Sister Ray (Number of data: two young women, three middle-aged men) to Reckless Records (Number of data: eight middle-aged men, a woman, probably around 20), is a day long because of a meeting in London and goes through the shops to fill the few hours.</seg>
<seg id="14">Is he a collector, I ask?</seg>
<seg id="15">"I guess," he says.</seg>
<seg id="16">I have about 3,000 or 4.000 plates.</seg>
<seg id="17">These records, pictured above (he sent me the snapshot by e-mail, I did not follow him home), dress the walls of his living room.</seg>
<seg id="18">The reason why he has such a considerable number of albums and singles is the result of his available income: he is now able to buy records he could not afford when she appeared and re-buy items he sold when he was young and broke.</seg>
<seg id="19">"many things I buy are from the late 60s, early 70s, which appeared when I was 11 or 12. things in which I was probably something too young to buy them," he says.</seg>
<seg id="20">He agrees that those who buy records are rather introverted and would like to spend time alone, and adds: "I don't smoke and I don't drink very much.</seg>
<seg id="21">This is my vice.</seg>
<seg id="22">WEZ, 25, who works with Sister Ray, also believes that many customers that he meets can apply to the YouGov profile.</seg>
<seg id="23">But he also noticed a new wave of people who are influenced by the media, people who heard about the comeback and are forced to buy their old records again.</seg>
<seg id="24">From the conversations I have conducted, people usually get rid of their collection in 1998 or 1999.</seg>
<seg id="25">"" "" "" "customers who once sold their records to buy CDs are now selling their CDs to buy their records again," "" "" "" "he says." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="26">This would explain the boom to trailers of a certain age.</seg>
<seg id="27">But what about the alleged emotional importance of records?</seg>
<seg id="28">It takes only a few seconds in a shop like Follonica to see that record shops offer a calming community of like-minded people.</seg>
<seg id="29">According to WEZ, some of the older customer contacted the contactless payment system.</seg>
<seg id="30">Some record fans feel overwhelmed by the digital world and want to retreat to the stability of familiar vinyl covers, of objects that call for happy memories.</seg>
<seg id="31">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "I think sometimes it can be the filling of a void or property of material possessions as a kind of comfort," "" "" "" "says WEZ." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="32">This is for me as a collector so and I think it's so with many people.</seg>
<seg id="33">It is a simple way to mentally engage.</seg>
<seg id="34">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "we are like their social workers!" "" "" "" "an employee floats from a stack of plates." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="35">An ICM survey in April revealed that almost 50% of people who bought a record last month have not yet listened to.</seg>
<seg id="36">The survey also found that 41% have a record player that they never use, while 7% of those who purchase a record are not having a record player.</seg>
<seg id="37">At this time of the news report I would probably look very worried while looking through a pile of bossa nova compilations.</seg>
<seg id="38">Jonny, 42, who works at Sounds of the Universe (Number of data: three middle-aged men) has noticed a "trophy aspect" of the Revival.</seg>
<seg id="39">"someone just came here recently and said," I don't have a record player, but I'd like to buy a Radiohead Records, so that I can put them on the shelf, "he says.</seg>
<seg id="40">This is not a big percentage, but it definitely happens.</seg>
<seg id="41">More product-sensitive, less musicastic.</seg>
<seg id="42">"" "" "" "we have people who say:" "" "" "" "I have no record player." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="43">These are younger people, not older ones, who first come in slowly.</seg>
<seg id="44">Opp, which has devoted almost a whole floor to the sound plates, has a blower audience when I go in.</seg>
<seg id="45">There are couples around 70, tourists who take photos, teenage boys and middle-aged women.</seg>
<seg id="46">Even though the atmosphere is slightly less relaxed than in the above shops - Wild Beasts's latest synthesiology and extract-packed pop instead of experimental jazz wears out of the loudspeakers - it is good to see such diversity among the customers.</seg>
<seg id="47">None of them looks strange, but the psychological trauma is difficult to detectable if you stand beside someone for 30 seconds.</seg>
<seg id="48">Elanora, 27, has been in business for a few minutes and considers the variety of plates available for sale.</seg>
<seg id="49">It rather makes a window-shopping as a big shopping.</seg>
<seg id="50">It does not earn much, so collecting records is not a real option, she says.</seg>
<seg id="51">It costs a lot.</seg>
<seg id="52">It is easy to listen to music from a computer or in a different way, but the beauty of records is... "she drives off with a dearest sigh.</seg>
<seg id="53">I don't know how to explain it - it's really unique.</seg>
<seg id="54">My last stop is a business that is said to have inspired a new generation of record lovers: urban outfitters.</seg>
<seg id="55">While I'm pretending to wear jeans in pants, I watch a group of young teenage girls grouping around Polaroid cameras for a moment before a father and his daughter think about buying a crosley record player.</seg>
<seg id="56">On the left there is a staircase, a wall full of records of Adele, Jeff Buckley, Amy Winehouse and Fleetwood Mac: a mix of contemporary music and classics, the essential panels for an average collection.</seg>
<seg id="57">Nobody can see them - maybe because they are purely decorative, some so far above that it is impossible to touch them.</seg>
<seg id="58">It is pure "record art."</seg>
<seg id="59">But considering that every attraction for these items would mean more money for the industry and some customers could send some customers to the depths of Soho there is nothing to complain.</seg>
<seg id="60">It is no surprise that a population group that has more time and money than others, is also the one that is most used for luxury items such as plates.</seg>
<seg id="61">Even if my research shows that the results of YouGov vote, they leave, at least in record stores in Soho, the large number of female collectors that exist in reality, record stores and online forums.</seg>
<seg id="62">These people are probably working hard at school or in offices.</seg>
<seg id="63">They won't spend their Thursday morning security with the stroll through the record shops of Berwick Street and the leaves by plates, while they avoid the staring gaze of an uncanny, 30-year-old false presenter who rises above the shoulders of unsuspecting middle-aged men.</seg>

<seg id="2">A French court rejected an offer by the authorities in Calais, dozens of temporary shops and restaurants in the jungle of Calais, where thousands of refugees live.</seg>
<seg id="3">During a trial hearing this week, the authorities argued in Calais that the state should be able to break down 72 temporary businesses in which individuals within the camp sell goods, from cigarettes to Energydrinks, sell barber services or sell tea for 50 cents (40 pence) or simple meals for a few euros in temporary restaurants.</seg>
<seg id="4">The Calais prefecture argued that these places were to be demolished because they would represent a parallel economy from which no taxes would be paid and which would provide a fire and sanity risk.</seg>
<seg id="5">Humanitarian groups told the court that the shops and restaurants were important, as the free meals offered by the federally supported Association and other groups would not provide enough food for the growing numbers in the camp.</seg>
<seg id="6">They also concluded that temporary businesses and restaurants would often offer accommodation and free meals for people in need.</seg>
<seg id="7">A court in Lille decided that there would be no legal basis for the expulsion of people who run the 72 temporary businesses, but admitted that the concerns of the Calais prefecture are absolutely understandable. "</seg>

<seg id="2">The impressive achievement of Britain at 7-7 rugby came to an abrupt halt at the last hurdle in the form of Fijis, when they were hit in Rio with a result of 43-7 in the Deodoro Stadium.</seg>
<seg id="3">Fiji issued a master class in handling, Side-Stepping, back-back, line run and raw power to win Gold - their first Olympic medal of any color.</seg>
<seg id="4">The defeat was missed due to the not too bad trophy of the silver medal - Britain's fourth on that day - and they could be quite proud of their efforts in this tournament in which they beat New Zealand, Argentina and South Africa.</seg>
<seg id="5">The clear defeat of the Boks, 7-5 in the semifinals on the same day could fall back on them in the final.</seg>
<seg id="6">But irrespective of this, Fiji could have put a 15-man-team in best shape in this form.</seg>
<seg id="7">It could be a consolation for GB - but it probably won't - that at least a Briton will have a gold medal around his neck tomorrow: Fijis head coach Ben Ryan, former boss for England from Wimbledon.</seg>
<seg id="8">GB had a difficult path behind it.</seg>
<seg id="9">Eight years ago, under Ryan, she lost every game at the Adelaide Sevens.</seg>
<seg id="10">Here they just lost one.</seg>
<seg id="11">This hatch will hurt, but progress is amazing.</seg>
<seg id="12">Fiji began miraculously and let the attacks bounce out of fun.</seg>
<seg id="13">It felt for captain Tom Mitchell and Co. as if they were running in running buses. the World Series winners went 5-0 upwards, when Osea Kolinisau froze in the corner.</seg>
<seg id="14">With still four minutes of playing, Jerry Tuvi added another attack from the right corner he turned around.</seg>
<seg id="15">12-0 and GB hardly touched the ball.</seg>
<seg id="16">A succulent Tackle of Mitchell stopped the mountain of man Leone Nakarawa to score a third gate, but it just stopped Fiji.</seg>
<seg id="17">In the seventh minute lete jasa Veremalua left a touch down in the right corner and it stood 0-17 for GB.</seg>
<seg id="18">Nakarawa added a new one since the replay and there was still more than a minute playing time... in the first half.</seg>
<seg id="19">Vatemo Ravouvou pressured through other weak tacklings of the GB team and rushed to the line to make a gate.</seg>
<seg id="20">The conversion brought a 29-0 to a break.</seg>
<seg id="21">It's as if Fiji was born to play 7, while GB is still learning.</seg>
<seg id="22">That's the way it is.</seg>
<seg id="23">GB led basic changes to the half-time and closed the fijianian void... for four minutes, which was good for the circumstances of the first half until Joshua passed Tuisova after a brilliant stopover of Fiji.</seg>
<seg id="24">Dan Norton started an attempt for GB, made a touch down in the left corner for a 36-7, but the game was long in favor of the South seeinsulans, whose fans sanged, flags wave and danced on the tribune.</seg>
<seg id="25">It was not difficult to admire the playful approach of Fijis.</seg>
<seg id="26">Mata Viliame replaced the icing on the cake with another try in the last few seconds.</seg>
<seg id="27">The fijis sounded, the Fijis embraced and GB tidded crushingly in the grass.</seg>
<seg id="28">Earlier on the day, Fiji conquered Japan in the semi-finals with 20-5 and Britain pushed South Africa in a short semi-finalmatch of the race - Britain's conversion of difference.</seg>
<seg id="29">Kyle Brown brought the Boks forward in the first half, but Dan Norton broke through the line with an impressive footwork and scored a gate among the posts in the second half.</seg>
<seg id="30">A brilliant late tackling by Marcus Watson, brother of Anthony the English 15-Aside Team, secured the win - and thus the silver medal.</seg>

<seg id="8">Behind all this is Rupert Schachller, who was employed for 31 years in the Employer-Employer, 28 years as Managing Director.</seg>
<seg id="9">He was now retired at the age of 65.</seg>
<seg id="10">The Drinking Water Authority of the Veitensteingruppe with its headquarters in Kottendorf, municipality Breitbrunn, promotes approximately 150,000 cubic metres of water annually and supplies 32 places and hamlets with approximately 5500 inhabitants.</seg>
<seg id="11">Member municipalities are the municipalities Kirchbrunn, Breitbrunn, Lauter, Ebelsbach and the town of Baunach.</seg>
<seg id="12">There are water supply contracts for further cities and municipalities.</seg>
<seg id="13">The current chairwoman, Breitbrunn Bürgermeisterei Gertrud Bühl (FW), reminded that Rupert Schachller was hired as a water wart in 1985 and was appointed Managing Director of the Betting Association in 1988.</seg>
<seg id="14">"his tasks have been very diverse and they extended from water management and maintenance work on office and organizational activities, budget planning, calculation of fees and contributions to emergency operations on weekends," said the chairman.</seg>
<seg id="15">As outstanding events, she called the inauguration and inauguration of the new wells (1994), land purchases in the area of the new wells (1998) and compensation of farmers, the renovation of the high containers (1999), the repurchase of a central computer control system (2004) and the redevelopment of water pipes.</seg>

<seg id="17">In her laudation she praised Göllers faithful, reliable and correct service for over 31 years.</seg>
<seg id="18">He has applied himself with a lot of heart blood for his water-purpose-association and he has lived the water-purpose association regularly as if it were his own company.</seg>
<seg id="19">A few weeks ago, as a real practitioner, he was allowed to present the success concept of the Veitensteingruppe for nitrate reduction in front of the water forum of the Lower Franconia district.</seg>

<seg id="26">At minus 17 degrees all night had to be worked so that the villages could be supplied with water.</seg>

<seg id="1">Steel - Lichtblick for German steel industry</seg>
<seg id="2">The crisis-torn and energy-intensive German steel industry remains unaffected by additional costs in the millions.</seg>
<seg id="3">Financial burdens that the industry faces from green electricity production are from the table.</seg>
<seg id="4">The German Steel Industry Minister Sigmar Gabriel (SPD) of the "Westdeutsche Allgemeine Zeitung" (SPD) of the "West German Allgemeine Zeitung" (WAZ, Friday edition) remained in the German steel industry.</seg>
<seg id="5">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "I am really happy that we could finally reach tough negotiations after two years." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="6">As a result, the European Commission had initially planned to ask the steel producers who use gases from the blast furnace for generating electricity for their own consumption.</seg>
<seg id="7">According to the German industry association, the steel industry threatened an additional cost of 120 to 240 million euros per year.</seg>
<seg id="8">Gabriel stressed the WAZ, there is now a draft agreement with the European Commission after talks with Commissioner Margrethe Vestager.</seg>
<seg id="9">Only when the generators are replaced in the steel mills, an EEG levy of 20 percent falls.</seg>
<seg id="10">But even this will not be raised in the steel industry.</seg>
<seg id="11">IG Metall welcomed Germany's unification with the European Commission on self-power generation.</seg>
<seg id="12">In this way, the status quo of the previous arrangement is largely recorded.</seg>
<seg id="13">Gabriel's successful efforts for the steel industry have a special significance.</seg>

<seg id="17">The steel industry in Europe has suffered from overcapacity and considerable price pressure since the financial crisis in 2008.</seg>
<seg id="18">Last year, the situation increased further than the world's largest producer in China threw massive steel on the world market in light of the weakening domestic demand.</seg>
<seg id="19">European manufacturers accuse Chinese steel companies price dumping.</seg>
<seg id="20">In the course of this spring, the situation has eased a little.</seg>
<seg id="21">On the one hand, import duties imposed on import steel are showing effect, on the other hand the economic prospects in China have risen.</seg>
<seg id="22">It is not clear how sustainable the price collection is.</seg>
<seg id="23">German industry primus Thyssenkrupp was cautious on Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="24">Last but not least, the prices would have been stagnating.</seg>
<seg id="25">The industry responds to the difficult situation with further cost reductions.</seg>
<seg id="26">Finally ThyssenKrupp did not want to exclude the closure of individual works.</seg>
<seg id="27">Around 86000 people were employed in the German steel industry at the end of 2015.</seg>
<seg id="28">In July, the German steel manufacturers are cautious despite rising prices and increasing orders.</seg>
<seg id="29">With 3.4 million tonnes, they produced a good six percent less crude steel than in the previous year's month, as the Steel Business Unit communicated on Friday.</seg>
<seg id="30">After a short upliftment in May, the produced quantity left behind each other for the second month.</seg>
<seg id="31">Since the beginning of the year, production has been down two percent below the previous year's figure.</seg>
<seg id="32">The association expects an improved job situation in the coming months thanks to an improved order situation.</seg>

<seg id="1">Community, spirit, health: singing does seniors good</seg>
<seg id="2">Ursel Kipp had already accompanied her whole life: as a young girl she was in the school choir, she occupied the subject of music in the school choir, and today the 78-year-old sings in a senior choir.</seg>
<seg id="3">"singing moves me - emotionally and physically," she describes.</seg>
<seg id="4">After a rehearsal, she feels balanced, cheerful and overall alive, she says.</seg>
<seg id="5">By the way, she does something good for her health and mind.</seg>
<seg id="6">Because singing is a great hobby for seniors, Erhard Hackler says of the German senior league.</seg>
<seg id="7">Most senior citizens sing in the choir and share the joy of music with like-minded people, describing Hackler.</seg>
<seg id="8">Through regular cohabitation, seniors can socialize and maintain social contacts.</seg>
<seg id="9">Because often social and family structures dissolve in old age, a choir is then an ideal opportunity to spend time with other people.</seg>
<seg id="10">"" "" "" "this experience has also made Ursel Kipp in her choir:" "" "" "" "to pronounce and organise, to be able to rely on the others and to learn from each other - a choir is a very special form of being together." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="11">Singing can be exhausting in a positive sense, Hackler says.</seg>
<seg id="12">Seniors achieve deep and controlled breathing.</seg>
<seg id="13">Those who regularly demand their lungs are not so fast from the dolls in everyday life.</seg>
<seg id="14">Even when it comes to receiving the sound of the voice at the age, singing is an optimal hobby.</seg>
<seg id="15">On older people, singing often has a very special effect, says Ursula Lenz from the Federal Working Group of the Seniors "organisations.</seg>
<seg id="16">In the older generation, joint singing had a much higher priority, it belonged to everyday life, both at school and in leisure time, she explains.</seg>
<seg id="17">Lenz often observes that singing or listening to songs arouses a lot of memories in older people, often associated with positive feelings of their youth.</seg>
<seg id="18">Through lyrics and especially melodies, people who are self-reliant are falling down on long-lying events.</seg>
<seg id="19">When singing, a special performance is required for the head, Lenz explains.</seg>
<seg id="20">To concentrate on one's own voice and rhythm and adapt to the other singers - this is a great cognitive challenge.</seg>
<seg id="21">Especially older people who live alone practice not only to concentrate on themselves.</seg>
<seg id="22">Another positive aspect is the recognition you experience through singing in the choir, says Hackler.</seg>
<seg id="23">An enthusiastic audience is a great praise.</seg>
<seg id="24">The self-esteem is also growing through singing in the choir.</seg>
<seg id="25">To show yourself: if I practise for a long time, I will be better and averse beyond myself - this experience strengthens.</seg>
<seg id="26">Good reasons to start singing are enough.</seg>
<seg id="27">Whoever wants to try a new hobby should not hesitate - even if he thinks he has little talent, Lenz advises.</seg>
<seg id="28">You don't sing alone - with 50 singing people, who hears when a sound goes wrong?</seg>
<seg id="29">Looking for the right offer, seniors have different options, says Hackler.</seg>
<seg id="30">If someone sings from the circle of acquaintances in a senior choir, one can simply join.</seg>
<seg id="31">Many cities also offer views of the choirs in the area.</seg>
<seg id="32">Those who want to sing in a church choir can turn directly to the church or the church leader.</seg>
<seg id="33">Many of the senior citizens can also be found via the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="34">Those who do not have access to the Internet can ask the family, friends or neighbours to help with the internet research.</seg>
<seg id="35">Those who feel like singing should definitely join a choir, Hackler recommends.</seg>
<seg id="36">Singing does the soul well and has something liberating - this applies to any age.</seg>

<seg id="2">Biologists have studied in Hanover what effect the fen of kittens has on adult animals.</seg>
<seg id="3">To their surprise, the mistrust also didn't let the males cold - however they behaved always the same in contrast to the females.</seg>

<seg id="8">She is the first author of the study published on this Friday in the journal "BMC Evolutionary Biology."</seg>
<seg id="9">In a previous study, the research team had already found out that the duration and pitch of the kittens' cries differs with the urgency of their neediness.</seg>
<seg id="10">A total of nine adult males and eight female kittens were observed from the animal husbandry of the MHH.</seg>
<seg id="11">They were played for a first call of babies who were taken out of the litter box for three minutes and separated from mother and siblings.</seg>
<seg id="12">On the other hand, they were confronted with screaming of more excited kittens, who were additionally lifted up.</seg>
<seg id="13">Despite the small sample, the researchers consider their results to be meaningful.</seg>
<seg id="14">"all females, even those who did not have their own offspring, reacted to the screaming," Konerding said.</seg>
<seg id="15">They turned out faster to the loudspeaker, when this calls of the very excited kittens played out.</seg>
<seg id="16">This ability may be innate or develop with the sexually mature.</seg>

<seg id="1">Bomb terror in Thailand - Austrian woman injured - Several dead</seg>
<seg id="2">The Austrian Embassy in Thailand was in contact with the woman, said the spokesman of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Thomas Schnöll, Friday morning.</seg>
<seg id="3">She had suffered cuts and had been treated in hospital, but I already had to leave it again.</seg>
<seg id="4">She planned her home trip at the beginning of September.</seg>
<seg id="5">Whether the further explosions on the island of Phuket as well as in the southern cities of Surat Thani, Phang Nga, Trang and Chumphon are also affected by Austrian citizens, is still unclear.</seg>
<seg id="6">In this regard, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs is in constant contact with local authorities, "says Schnöll.</seg>
<seg id="7">In the approximately 200 kilometres south of Bangkok's capital Bangkok, Hua Hin was initially exploding two bombs on Thursday evening.</seg>
<seg id="8">According to the police, a Thai woman was killed and about 20 people were injured, including the Austrian, three Germans, three Dutch and three Italians.</seg>
<seg id="9">Friday morning two explosives went up again, and another man was killed according to the authorities.</seg>
<seg id="10">Also from Phuket a bomb explosion was reported in the morning.</seg>
<seg id="11">During the detonation in the vicinity of the popular seaside resort Patong, a taxi driver was injured according to police instructions.</seg>
<seg id="12">In Surat Thani on the south-eastern coast of the country another bomb exploded, killing an urban workers.</seg>
<seg id="13">According to the authorities, the explosive set had gone into the air in a bouquet of flowers in front of the Revier of the Coastal Police.</seg>
<seg id="14">After all detonations in Phang Nga and Trang on the south-west coast as well as in Chumphon on the south-east coast demanded several injured.</seg>
<seg id="15">There was a connection with the explosions in Hua Hin.</seg>
<seg id="16">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "the bombals carry the same signature," "" "" "" "said army general Danai Kritmethavee Friday morning before journalists." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="17">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "we assume that it is a coordinated attack." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="18">It is too early to express itself on possible motives - but it is probably a matter of the actions of Muslim rebels.</seg>
<seg id="19">Thai media also wanted to see a pattern typical of the bombate attacks of Muslim separatists in the south of the country.</seg>
<seg id="20">The Thai police, on the other hand, declared that the attacks were not in connection with the Islamist rebellion or with international terrorism.</seg>
<seg id="21">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "this is only local sabotage which is limited to limited territories and provinces," "" "" "" "said a spokesman in Bangkok." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="22">Rather, it is assumed that the bombs were placed by opponents of the ruling military junta.</seg>
<seg id="23">In recent days, the authorities would have kept secret evidence of upcoming attacks in the south of the country - however, they were not informed about the exact time and places.</seg>
<seg id="24">It is still unclear which group is behind the attacks.</seg>
<seg id="25">The police instructed their officials throughout the country to increase security around important government buildings and airports, train stations, tourist attractions, restaurants and entertainment districts.</seg>
<seg id="26">In Thailand, there are always smaller bomb attacks, but most of them are not directed against tourists.</seg>
<seg id="27">In Hua Hin is a palace used for years by Thailands King Bhumibol Adulyadej.</seg>
<seg id="28">After the well-hearted bomb explosions, the Austrian Ministry of Foreign Affairs is recommending its homepage to follow the instructions of the Thai security authorities.</seg>
<seg id="29">High security risk (security level 3) was applicable to the provinces of Narathiwat, Yala, Pattani and Songhkla and Preah Vihear and surroundings.</seg>
<seg id="30">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "after disputes between security forces and Muslim populations, the necessary trips to these provinces are not recommended." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="31">Increased security risk (security level 2) was applicable to the rest of the country.</seg>
<seg id="32">The attacks on Thursday and Friday were held a few days after a controversial referendum on a constitution drafted by the military junta.</seg>
<seg id="33">This gives the military a great influence over the coming years.</seg>
<seg id="34">Junta chief and prime minister Prayut Chan-o-cha said that the bombs were an attempt to create chaos while the country moves towards stability, improvement of economic situation and tourism.</seg>
<seg id="35">The military unta, who had seized power in 2014 after a period of bloody unrest, will benefit himself from having restored the kingdom to stability and order.</seg>
<seg id="36">However, it has not been possible for the military to get a grip on the insurgency of Muslim rebels for years in the extreme south of the country.</seg>
<seg id="37">More than 6500 people have already been killed in the conflict.</seg>
<seg id="38">Almost a year ago, 20 people were killed in Bangkok at a stop at a popular Hindu shrine - most of them foreign tourists.</seg>
<seg id="39">It was the bloodiest attack of the country's younger history.</seg>

<seg id="21">The decisive factor is whether such people have a controlling influence on the party.</seg>
<seg id="22">This is not recognizable.</seg>

<seg id="1">Rio 2016: ROBEL Kiros Habte Becomes Internethite</seg>
<seg id="2">The Olympic Games or World Records don't always determine the headlines of the Olympic Games.</seg>
<seg id="3">This shows the courageous appearance of Robel Kiros Habte at the summer games in Rio de Janeiro.</seg>
<seg id="4">At the Aquatics Center, the slightly overweight swimmers from Ethiopia slowly swam so slow that he was no longer seen in the TV pictures.</seg>
<seg id="5">It simply disappeared - no matter how far the cutout was selected.</seg>
<seg id="6">In social networks, Habte was subsequently promoted to viral internethite.</seg>
<seg id="7">In fact, the 24-year-old finished with a 48-second setback and finished the 59th place of 59 starters.</seg>
<seg id="8">But it was rather his not just athletic figure that attracted the attention of the international media.</seg>
<seg id="9">Why does the 24-year-old take part in the Olympics?</seg>
<seg id="10">The Ethiopian got a special startright from the international swimming association.</seg>
<seg id="11">This is distributed to make swimming in underrepresented countries better known.</seg>
<seg id="12">Since most sportsmen run in Ethiopia, Habte wanted to do something else.</seg>
<seg id="13">Preparation is everything: ROBEL Kiros Habte is ready for the big race.</seg>
<seg id="14">Quickly the first nicknames made the round.</seg>
<seg id="15">Some media referred to him as "Robel of the Wal."</seg>
<seg id="16">The English tabloid "The Sun" made fun of him with "Dad Bod."</seg>
<seg id="17">His time, he only struck with a minute and almost five seconds over the 100 m Freestyle, played no role here.</seg>
<seg id="18">Comparisons with "Eric the Eel" were also drawn.</seg>
<seg id="19">During the 2000 Olympic Games in Sydney, the run of Eric Moussambani took care of media attention.</seg>
<seg id="20">The appearance of the swimmers from Equatorial Guinea was an unforgettable experience, when he had to race alone on his own in a forenema of more than 100 metres.</seg>
<seg id="21">At that time Moussambani was fired at that time.</seg>
<seg id="22">The 22-year-old learned to swim just eight months before the Olympics and had never taken such a long distance before the competition.</seg>

<seg id="1">The fees per cubic metre of waste water will be for the area of the sewage system Neudorf / Reuth / Welschahl 3,44 instead of 2.10 euros; for Zultenberg / Lindenberg / Lopp. 3.36 Euro (previously 2,26 Euro) and for Azendorf 3,64 Euro (previously 2,18 euros).</seg>
<seg id="2">At the facility in Azendorf, the waste water charge will be increased by the latest if appropriate improvement measures are necessary.</seg>
<seg id="3">After a rough calculation, the waste water price in Azendorf will then be 4.37 euros per cubic metre.</seg>
<seg id="4">As mayor Bernd Steinhäuser (CSU) reported, with the approval of the household through the office office Kulmbach, it was established that undercover for these sewage plants was running.</seg>
<seg id="5">Due to the legal basis, the market Kasendorf is obliged to operate the plants in a cost-covering manner.</seg>
<seg id="6">As of 1 October 2016, the citizens and the industrial and industrial companies from Welschahl, Neudorf, Reuth, Azendorf, Lopp, Lindenberg and Zultenberg will have to go deeper into the wallet.</seg>
<seg id="7">Increases in fees are between 48 and 67 percent.</seg>
<seg id="8">As Managing Director Herbert Schmidt displayed the body, a new calculation of fees for the wastewater facilities of the market community was necessary.</seg>
<seg id="9">Over the period from October 2016 to September 2020, over- and undercover from the previous calculation period should also be equalled.</seg>
<seg id="10">Schmidt explained the grave fee increases in all three wastewater facilities with relatively small facilities with a very low waste water attack, which is between 6800 and 12000 cubic meters per year.</seg>
<seg id="11">Due to the low distribution basis, for example, expenses for necessary repairs would have a serious impact on several thousand euros.</seg>
<seg id="12">In addition, the waste water volume in all three plants is slightly declining.</seg>
<seg id="13">Furthermore, in all three installations, renovation and repair expenditures in all three facilities were not least incurred in all three facilities due to their age.</seg>
<seg id="14">The facility in Azendorf is nearly 30 years old, the facilities for Welsh, Neudorf and Reuth as well as Zultenberg, Lindenberg and Lopp are almost 20 years old.</seg>
<seg id="15">Schmidt indicated that the mechanical ventilation system had to be replaced on the basis of a damage in the Azendorf sewage system.</seg>
<seg id="16">After almost 20 years of operation the first sewage ponds had to be removed, the sewage sludge disposed of and an additional ventilation possibility had to be installed in order to comply with the water-legal requirements in the future.</seg>
<seg id="17">Schmidt: "these extraordinary expenses resulted in continued support and maintenance costs, which are to be taken into account in the new calculation period."</seg>
<seg id="18">The same applies to electricity costs, which were clearly below the current level in the previous calculation in the years 2011 / 2012.</seg>
<seg id="19">Stone houses made it clear that in the three plants, the expenses for operation and maintenance were "fully penetrated" in the three plants. "</seg>
<seg id="20">Schmidt, the market community of large maintenance costs in the wastewater facilities in the past 20 years, has been spared.</seg>
<seg id="21">The situation for the aforementioned equipment will continue to remain precarious in view of stone houses, especially since the supply area of the Friesenbachtal wastewater association is not to be extended because it is a deficit system.</seg>

<seg id="2">Snapchat says that this filter is anime-inspired, but some observers say that it is insensitive to races.</seg>
<seg id="3">With its filtering tool, Snapchat enables around 150 million daily users to change the reality and to play with identities in such a way that already borders on the absurd.</seg>
<seg id="4">You can transform yourself into a pineapple, a dog or a figure that could be a painting from a Roy Lichtenstein.</seg>
<seg id="5">The filters are immaculate, self-rotating tools that generate more than 30 million improved selfies per day.</seg>
<seg id="6">All missteps get to the public.</seg>
<seg id="7">In the past, snapchat filters have been criticizing critics in which they were accused of supporting the app blackface promoting or white skin as a beauty ideal.</seg>
<seg id="8">When this week suggested a filter to some users that gave them slag eyes, false teeth and dark cheeks, some critics called a racist caricature from Asians - "jaundice."</seg>
<seg id="9">They asked themselves whether these repeated controversies pointed to a greater problem that the company has with diversity.</seg>
<seg id="10">The news and outrage were widespread on Wednesday, with reports by The Verge and Motherboard, a day after Snapchat communicated that it would have turned off the feature.</seg>
<seg id="11">The company offered an apology: the filter was intended as a homage to anime characters and not as caricature of Asians.</seg>
<seg id="12">But outsiders who have experienced racism reminded the filter of hurtful clichés.</seg>
<seg id="13">Others rejected the anime comparison.</seg>
<seg id="14">In an email, Grace Sparapani wrote a Korean-American art student whose tweets were widespread over the photos that the filter was "hurtful and mildly said."</seg>
<seg id="15">"" "" "" "she added that" "" "" "" "it is difficult to argue with the contrast of a very disgusting Asian caricature and filter effects." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="16">It shows that the filter is not yellowish, but that the yellowing of the yellow face was pulled into the cutting extremity.</seg>
<seg id="17">Snapchat is not the only company that crosses this cultural pride.</seg>
<seg id="18">American culture seems to be involved in an endless diversity of diversity and integration, from conference rooms to Hollywood and the devices that we all hold in hand.</seg>
<seg id="19">And Snapchats large audience of young people - who are more different in terms of race than their older opponents - could be more likely to expect sensitivity.</seg>
<seg id="20">If one of Snapchats filters creates a picture that is insulting for a user, "it is much more difficult that such items remain unnoticed when it was the case," said the 25-year-old Katie Zhu in an interview on Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="21">On Thursday Zhu, who works as a product manager and engineer for medium, decided to delete her Snapchat account and asked others to do the same.</seg>
<seg id="22">In an essay on medium and in a telephone interview, she said that she believes that mass-related controversies reflect a lack of diversity in the settings practices at Snapchat.</seg>
<seg id="23">Zhu criticized the large part white, only male leadership and ended her essay with a hashtag: # DeleteSnapchat.</seg>
<seg id="24">"either she has no diverse representation of people with other skin colors in her workforce, so that they can make such decisions," said the Chinese-American Zhu, "or they have people with other skin colors that work there, but are not in positions where they feel safe or comfortable to say about it."</seg>
<seg id="25">Others share their opinion, a complaint that Snapchat has largely left unanswered.</seg>
<seg id="26">The company does not publish numbers on the diversity of its workforce and points to its status as a private company.</seg>
<seg id="27">On Thursday, snapchat refused to discuss the cultural background of his collaborators, but according to a spokesperson, the company recently set up a HR officer focused on underrepresented population groups and internal integration efforts.</seg>
<seg id="28">Zhu said that she will be closed to her Snapchat account and added, "I wonder if they need more users like us to say that this is not O.K.."</seg>

<seg id="1">Military leadership distorted ISIS intelligence gathering information, rejects the Committee of the Congress</seg>
<seg id="2">Military personnel of the United States Central Command changed intelligence information to draw a more optimistic picture of the war against the so-called Islamic State in Iraq and Syria, as it had allowed the actual conditions on the ground, reported an inquiry committee of the Congress in a report on Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="3">The preliminary report, created by a Task Force of the Republican members of the Army Committees, Secret Service Committees, and the Arms-budget compromise, reports of great discontent under Central Command secret service analysts who reported how superiors changed their assessments on American efforts in the fight against the Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="4">The Central Command, short Cencom, is the military headquarters in Tampa, Florida, which controls the American military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia.</seg>
<seg id="5">"intelligence-related information, typically inspired by high-level CentCom commanders, regularly reported a positive picture of US efforts against terrorism when it allowed the actual conditions on the ground and were consistently positive as analyses of other intelligence services," a newspaper article quoted the report.</seg>
<seg id="6">"what happened at CentCom is unacceptable - our soldiers suffer if poor analysis presents our political leaders," Ken Calvert, a republican member of the House of Representatives, established.</seg>
<seg id="7">The leadership mistakes in the Centcom range up to the top of the organization.</seg>
<seg id="8">The ten-page report presents detailed problems in the years 2014 and 2015 in the descriptions and analyses of American efforts in the training of the Iraqi forces.</seg>
<seg id="9">Although there is no direct evidence that government peaks have given instructions under Obama to change the reports, it shows how analysts faced pressure from their superiors to draw a more optimistic picture of the threat of the Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL.</seg>
<seg id="10">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "during the first half of 2015, many Central Command press releases, statements and statements prior to Congress were much more positive than the facts" "" "" "". "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="11">For example, a CentCom member announced publicly that a military reconquest of Mossuls could already begin in April or May 2015.</seg>
<seg id="12">Mosul, the second largest city in Iraq, remains under the control of the Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="13">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "after months of investigation, so much is clear." "" "" "" "said Mike Pompeo, Republican Congressman from Kansas, in a statement." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="14">From the middle of 2014 to the middle of 2015, the leaders of the Central Command changed the intelligence reports to downplay the danger of ISIS in Iraq.</seg>
<seg id="15">The Republicans launched the Task Force in life after they were admitted that analysts were worried about the manipulation of reports to the Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="16">The report published on Thursday will be completed by more detailed information while investigating.</seg>
<seg id="17">In addition, further investigations of the Centcom reports are underway by the Secretary General of the Ministry of Defense.</seg>
<seg id="18">Democratic members of the Intelligence Committee published their own findings on Thursday, which coincided with some of the conclusions of the Republican Task Force.</seg>
<seg id="19">"in the years 2014 and 2015, the CentCom created an overly restricted process for the creation of intelligence services for ISIL and Iraqi security services," the highest-ranking demokrat in the committee, member of the House of Representatives Adam B. Schiff, announced in an opinion.</seg>
<seg id="20">This process, as Mr. Schiff, "delayed the publication of intelligence reports," damaged morals among analysts and "overly little room for dissenting opinions."</seg>
<seg id="21">But Mr. Ship and the Democrats gave no evidence of the White House intervening at the CentCom analysts regarding a "definite political opinion."</seg>
<seg id="22">Preliminary results of the investigations of the congress were published on Tuesday by "The Daily Beast."</seg>
<seg id="23">Last August, the New York Times reported an investigation by the Pentagon's General Inspector, which was inscribed on Centcom analysts.</seg>
<seg id="24">According to Cmdr. Patrick Evans, a Pentagon spokesman, in a statement that the Ministry of Defense would not comment on the congress, while the investigation of the General Inspector is still underway.</seg>
<seg id="25">But he also stated that "experts sometimes have divergent opinions about the interpretation of complex data, and that the intelligence agencies and the Ministry of Defense welcome a controversial discussion of these important issues of national defence."</seg>
<seg id="26">The investigation has triggered repercussions on the question of a successful air campaign under US leadership in Iraq and Syria (a claim that is now being made by a growing number of members of the Ministry of Defense).</seg>
<seg id="27">However, last year's accusations raised the question of how President Obama can rely on the Central Command for honest assessment of military operations in Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya and other crisis regions.</seg>
<seg id="28">The criticism of the secret information about the Islamic State is reminiscent of disputes from more than ten years ago, when a CentCom analyst, Gregory Hooker, wrote a document about how the then government under George W. Bush foresaw only a small occupation force in Iraq and had little time to think about the consequences of the 2003 invasion.</seg>
<seg id="29">Mr. Hooker also played a key role in the revolt against current reporting on the Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="30">Last year, the team headed by Mr. Hooker states that contrary to the government's statements, air strikes against the refineries held by the Islamic State would have no significant effect on the financial situation of the terrorist group, as these provisional refineries would have put into operation to sell oil on the black market.</seg>
<seg id="31">This recognition, however, was not published, the Times reported in September.</seg>
<seg id="32">Centres damaliger Commander, Gen. Lloyd J. Austin III, was criticised by members of the legislature because of his overly positive assessment of the war situation during a hearing before the Senate.</seg>
<seg id="33">General Austin retired in April and was replaced by Gen. Joseph L. Votel.</seg>

<seg id="2">One day after shooting three gates during a 6-1 victory over Japan, Katie Bam also made the first two doors for the American field hockey team of women in a match on Thursday against India that the Americans won 3-0.</seg>
<seg id="3">Five goals in two games should actually represent a memorable achievement, but Bam (27) said that she could not remember what has ever done.</seg>
<seg id="4">"I have no idea." she said.</seg>
<seg id="5">I am not one of the people who keep their goals in memory.</seg>

<seg id="9">The first placed one will move the strong Dutch slightly longer out of the way that will lead the other group.</seg>
<seg id="10">As always the game may go out on Saturday, the Americans have triggered a surprising vortex through their success story, four years after they landed at the last London Games in the last of 12 places.</seg>
<seg id="11">BAM was part of this team.</seg>
<seg id="12">She grew up in Blue Bell, Pennsylvania, and for the first time at three years had a hockey club in hands (her two older sisters played sports at Drexel University), at 16 years she became a national player of the USA, the youngest in the history of the team.</seg>

<seg id="19">On Thursday evening, Bam opened the doorway in the first half of the game with a back hand from the close range.</seg>
<seg id="20">India had gone into the game without victory, but the team turned out surprisingly tough and held the score from 1-0 to the third quarter until Bam took the game into her hands.</seg>
<seg id="21">She performed a sprint with the flat ball over the left flank, then moved into the middle and pulled the ball into the gate to give the American female a 2-0 guide.</seg>

<seg id="1">In the heart of the Rage of the Olympic Games, the Zen of trampolines</seg>
<seg id="2">Wherever you are, as late as it is, the Olympics are.</seg>
<seg id="3">In Rio de Janeiro, the events in Rio de Janeiro are constantly growing and inevitable, a rattling relay race between competition and aspiration.</seg>
<seg id="4">It is as if the Olympic torch itself is a burning staff that is handed down from the crossbow to the swimmers to the gymnastics for triathletes.</seg>
<seg id="5">You can't turn on TV, read a newspaper or listen to your neighbor's conversation in the coffee shop without hearing about Simone Biles, Katie Ledecky or the fight between Michael Phelps and Chad le Clos.</seg>
<seg id="6">And then there is Logan Dooley.</seg>
<seg id="7">Dooley, who for the first time at the Olympic Games and a swarm of women with dimples, could have been among these well-known names that were sent to Prime Time, built up by sponsors and well-being TV advertising, if he were a swimmers, gymnasts or even fencers.</seg>
<seg id="8">But Dooley, 28, from Lake Forest, California, is fighting gold in the Olympic trampoline.</seg>
<seg id="9">The Olympic flame does not illuminate every event.</seg>
<seg id="10">Further from the centre, partly in the shade, are the sports that are not universally recognized: air gun shooting, archery, badminton, Taekwondo.</seg>
<seg id="11">We will always have the breaststroke and may it rule for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="12">But if I would like to make arguments for my particular darling, then let me draw your attention to the discreet charm of the trampoline.</seg>
<seg id="13">Although the trampoline has been an Olympic event since 2000, when it had its debut in Sydney, it was so sparsely perceived over the past 16 years that many of them that I had interviewed didn't know that it was even an Olympic movement.</seg>
<seg id="14">This could also be regional ignorance.</seg>
<seg id="15">Although the USA sent athletes to compete, it has never won a medal in jumping and until 2012 had an athlete who made it to the final round.</seg>
<seg id="16">The Chinese and the Russians have a tendency to share prices for the men and the Chinese and the Canadians for women.</seg>
<seg id="17">Dong Dong from China and Rosie MacLennan from Canada will defend their gold medal from London this year.</seg>
<seg id="18">Jumping on the trampoline has a certain outsider charme, partly because it sounds more suitable for the unenlightened ear for a clown school than for the Olympic Games.</seg>
<seg id="19">At this point I should admit that I am not an expert, but only an experienced enthusiast.</seg>
<seg id="20">It has humorous potential - the cartoonous trembling of his never-ending growling - but also the grace of gymnastics and diving, the two sports that it essentially unites.</seg>
<seg id="21">The word "Trampoline" comes from the Spanish El Trampoline, which means as much as "springboard."</seg>
<seg id="22">Emerging winners jump on a giant trampoline, shoot almost up to 30 feet in the air and need a number of falling movements (turning, pike and saltos) before they land on their feet.</seg>
<seg id="23">According to the official program of the Olympic programme, they are evaluated according to the design, degree of difficulty and "flight time."</seg>
<seg id="24">Thirty-two athletes from 17 countries, 16 men and 16 women, will compete against each other in Rio.</seg>
<seg id="25">The most common Olympic vector is straight ahead.</seg>
<seg id="26">Medallists must continue in their quest for gold, faster, upward and above, sometimes up to the goal, sometimes back and forth, upwards and downwards on the playground.</seg>
<seg id="27">Not only do they hunt the finish line or the output wall, but also a further heightened destination in the television broadcasting: the world or the Olympic Games.</seg>
<seg id="28">The goal-oriented aspiration is nobel, admirable, even fanatic - and it is enough to even stir a spectator into tears.</seg>
<seg id="29">But it is also what I feel tiring even when watching these games.</seg>
<seg id="30">The trampoline offers a breathing space.</seg>
<seg id="31">The Vector of the trampoline jumper is above.</seg>
<seg id="32">A forward movement is not the goal.</seg>
<seg id="33">He or she bounces off, seemingly weightless like an astronaut, goes up, then down, then effortlessly back up.</seg>
<seg id="34">Here too there is a competition, of course not without difficulty, but during the exercise there is no hectic attack on the goal, not a wolf in the distance, only the dreamy, elegant lifting of time and gravity.</seg>
<seg id="35">It is as Zen as the competition can only be at the Olympic Games.</seg>
<seg id="36">The qualifying and final hours of the women will take place on Friday afternoon, in streaming at 13.00 Eastern Time; the men on Saturday, also at 13.00.</seg>
<seg id="37">NBC will radiate the final rounds as part of an afternoon block on both days from 14.00 onwards.</seg>
<seg id="38">In the midst of the Olympia mania they promise a quiet, nice moment, one that is likely to be overlooked in the general tumult.</seg>
<seg id="39">If the increase in consciousness can only be achieved by the sprue and the objections of male athletes - as the male US-Turner suggested recently - according to The Wall Street Journal - then Mr. Dooley expects his new fan base.</seg>

<seg id="4">Witnesses testified that tens of protesters were killed during the clashes with the police at shot changes.</seg>
<seg id="5">Is Ethiopia just going to collapse?</seg>
<seg id="6">Over the past ten years, it has been one of the most stable countries in Africa, a solid ally of the West with a rapidly growing economy.</seg>
<seg id="7">But in recent months protests against the government shook the country and expanded into more and more areas.</seg>
<seg id="8">Last week thousands of people stormed the streets and demanded fundamental political changes.</seg>
<seg id="9">According to human rights organizations, the government's response was ruthless.</seg>
<seg id="10">Witnesses stated that policemen shot and killed dozens of unarmed demonstrators.</seg>
<seg id="11">Circulating videos circulating on the protests, presumably from the last or the beginning of this year, show how security people hit young people with sticks while they were forced to make a stand against a wall.</seg>
<seg id="12">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "the head of the UN Human Rights authority now demands a thorough investigation." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="13">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "it has always been difficult to consolidate this country and in the future it will become even more difficult," "" "" "" "said Rashid Abdi, the leader of the Horn of Africa of the International Crisis Group, a research group." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="14">Ethiopia is the most populous country in Africa and its stability is estimated by the West.</seg>
<seg id="15">American military and intelligence services work closely with the Ethiopians to fight terrorist attacks beyond the region, especially in Somalia. only a few countries in Africa, if at all, get so much western help.</seg>
<seg id="16">Ethiopia's economy expanded at a remarkable pace.</seg>
<seg id="17">Its infrastructure has improved dramatically - there is a new commuter train in the capital Addis Abeba.</seg>
<seg id="18">The roads are usually quiet, safe and clean.</seg>
<seg id="19">Even though Ethiopia was anything but a model for democracy - human rights organisations have continuously led the repression by the government - the opposition in the country was curtailed, and dissidents were effectively silenced.</seg>
<seg id="20">Many were sent into exile or in prison, killed or driven into the expanse of the desert.</seg>
<seg id="21">But that could change.</seg>
<seg id="22">"if you press people and don't have any other options except to protest, it breaks out," said Seyoum Tesco, a lecturer in Central Ethiopia.</seg>
<seg id="23">The entire youth protests.</seg>
<seg id="24">A generation protests.</seg>
<seg id="25">There are numerous complaints that cover everything from land use to stranglehold over power of the ruling coalition.</seg>
<seg id="26">After a far-reaching election last year, the ruling party and its allies got the last seat of the opposition and now control 100 percent of the Parliament.</seg>
<seg id="27">At the same time, tensions continue along the border to Eritrea; a struggle for this jagged, controversial line called for hundreds of lives in June.</seg>
<seg id="28">Analysts fear that separatists such as the Oromo Liberation Front or the National Liberation Front of Ogaden have been forced to utilize the turbulence over the past few years and be able to rearm themselves.</seg>
<seg id="29">Several factors explain why feelings of bitterness explode after years of tinkage beneath the surface.</seg>
<seg id="30">The first seems harmless: smartphones.</seg>
<seg id="31">Only in recent years, many Ethiopians have been able to communicate with the social media, since cheaper smartphones have become more and more frequent and the internet services improved.</seg>
<seg id="32">Even if the government locks the access to Facebook and Twitter, which it does at regular intervals, especially in protests, many people still can communicate via Internet proxies that hide where they reside.</seg>
<seg id="33">Several young Ethiopians stated that they were so protesting.</seg>
<seg id="34">The second factor is that there is more solidarity between the Oromos and Amharas, the two largest ethnic groups in Ethiopia.</seg>
<seg id="35">The Oromos and Amharas are not natural enemies.</seg>
<seg id="36">For eons, the Amharas, who come from Ethiopia mainly Christian high-lands, prosperied in politics and economy as they exploited the Oromos, many of whom are Muslims and live in lowland areas.</seg>
<seg id="37">But that also changes.</seg>
<seg id="38">"we are here to coordinate below a screen," said Mulatu Gemechu, a leader of the Oromos.</seg>
<seg id="39">The biggest protests took place in areas of the Amhara and Oromos.</seg>
<seg id="40">Many Amharas and Oromos have the feeling that Ethiopia illegally dominated by members of the ethnic group of the Tigray who account for about 6 per cent of the population and are dominant in the military, intelligence services, trade and politics.</seg>
<seg id="41">The third reason for the unrest is the death of Meles Zenawi.</seg>
<seg id="42">Mr. Meles, a former rebel leader, was Ethiopian Prime Minister until his death in 2012 for 17 years.</seg>
<seg id="43">He was seen as a tactical genius, a man who could think around corners.</seg>
<seg id="44">Analysts say that he was particularly interested in perceiving early signs of dissatisfaction and using special officers to process opponents and make them harmless.</seg>
<seg id="45">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "the current regime lacks this basic skill," "" "" "" "said Mr Abdi, a conflict analyst." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="46">Ethiopian new Prime Minister, Hailemariam Desalegn, was chosen for relatively unclear reasons to take the position of Mr Meles.</seg>
<seg id="47">Unlike Mr. Meles, who came from the Tigray region of Northern Ethiopian, Mr. Hailemariam comes from the south.</seg>
<seg id="48">Analysts say that he does not enjoy the confidence of the security services controlled by the Tigray.</seg>
<seg id="49">Many fear that the result will be more bloodshed.</seg>
<seg id="50">The last time Ethiopia experienced such a turmoil in 2005, after thousands of polls protested, apparently pledged by the government according to information by analysts and then stolen.</seg>
<seg id="51">During the following raids many protesters were killed, even if there were less than in the last months and this period of unrest was passing relatively quickly.</seg>
<seg id="52">Development experts praised Ethiopian leaders for their visionary infrastructure planning, such as the new commuter train, and their measurable progress in combating poverty.</seg>
<seg id="53">But evidently this did not prevent the intensification of the internal misconception of the Ethiopian government.</seg>
<seg id="54">And it assumes a dangerous ethnic form.</seg>
<seg id="55">Last month protesters in Gondar, an ampersian city, attacked by Tigray and hatred of the Tigray becomes more and more common in the social media.</seg>
<seg id="56">Analysts say that the protests brought the US and other Western allies into a peculiar position.</seg>
<seg id="57">The American government used Ethiopia as a base for Dronenflights over neighboring Somalia, even though it has recently announced that it has closed this base.</seg>
<seg id="58">While the West is unequivocal to support democracy, he does not want his ally to collapse in an already volatile area.</seg>

<seg id="1">Donald Trump explains Obama's claim that ISIS was founded "sarcasm"</seg>
<seg id="2">Donald J. Trump tried to dispel the last controversy surrounding his campaign by attacking his multi-repeated assertion, President Obama and Hillary Clinton, the "founder" of the terrorist group Islamic State, not seriously meant.</seg>
<seg id="3">This clarification threw new questions on the communication skills of the Republican candidate, whether he was able to communicate clearly and understandable with the American public.</seg>
<seg id="4">It also brings along those comrades who endeavour to protect him during an eventful phase, in the peculiar position to declare statements which he could not have meant at all.</seg>
<seg id="5">After having made the announcement at an election campaign on Wednesday evening, Mr. Trump ruined in reference to the claim on Thursday and insisted in interviews that he really did not intend to suggest, the President and Mrs. Clinton had created ISIS.</seg>
<seg id="6">But in an early morning Tweet on Friday Mr. Trump said he was simply sarcastic.</seg>
<seg id="7">The Tweet was the opposite to the previous day Mr. Trump said in a number of interviews, he said the accusation completely serious.</seg>
<seg id="8">When the conservative Radiomoderator Hugh Hewitt asked Mr. Trump to weaken the statement by reminding him that Mr. Obama wants to destroy ISIS, the Republican candidate wanted nothing of it.</seg>
<seg id="9">The last storm of criticism rushes down on Mr. Trump, while he tried to steer the focus of his campaign because of falling changes in the economic situation.</seg>
<seg id="10">Mr. Trump and Mrs. Clinton kept talking about the economic situation in Michigan this week.</seg>
<seg id="11">On Friday Mr. Trump tried to return to this subject again.</seg>
<seg id="12">Talking about Twitter he warned that Mrs. Clinton's proposals would lead to higher taxes and that he found their speech boring.</seg>
<seg id="13">Mr. Trump has already brought sarcasm to his defense.</seg>
<seg id="14">At the end of July he strongly criticised himself when he said the Russians should hack Mrs. Clinton's emails, but later he explained "Of course, I thought the sarcastic."</seg>
<seg id="15">This method allows Mr. Trump to postpone the linguistic boundaries in politics and then return to demand.</seg>
<seg id="16">"I think it's one of his methods to test how certain messages are received by his fans as they arrive, and then" clarify "depending on how the reaction drops out." Ruth Sherman, a communication expert who observes the language of both candidates.</seg>
<seg id="17">But I also think he's clever enough to keep his statements vague enough so that they can be interpreted in a number of ways.</seg>
<seg id="18">Instead of defusing the tone for the presidential election, Mr. Trump has accepted an even more estimated tone, as his demand has continued to decline.</seg>
<seg id="19">A new survey by NBC / Wall Street Journal / Marist, published on Friday, showed a leading edge in the states North Carolina, Virginia, Colorado and a head-to-head race in Florida.</seg>
<seg id="20">While Mr. Trump has generally tried to excuse his provocative remarks, he often accuses his critics to distort his statements or misunderstand his humour.</seg>
<seg id="21">But while he is increasingly focusing on the attention in the last months of his presidential campaign, Mr. Trumps Scherze has brought his loyal fellows into the uncomfortable situation to stand up to him regardless of how provocative his statements might be.</seg>
<seg id="22">Rudolph W. Giuliani, former Mayor of New York and one of Trumps's most prominent intercessors, was struggling to defend the candidate today in a CNN interview on Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="23">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "I believe what he says are legitimate, political comments," "" "" "" "Mr Giuliani told him about the correctness of Mr. Trumps statements about whether Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton had founded the Islamic State." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="25">Most mainstream republicans attempt to argue that the government under Obama, in which Mrs. Clinton served as Foreign Minister, allowed ISIS to spread by making it aggressive in the Middle East.</seg>
<seg id="26">Prior to the election campaign events in Pennsylvania on Friday, Mr. Trump continued his attacks on the media and accused them of running on each of his words and being prejudiced against him.</seg>

<seg id="1">The depressing food of the economic crisis in "a rich meal"</seg>
<seg id="2">In March 1933, shortly after his rise to the President, Franklin Delano Roosevelt took his lunch at the Oval Office.</seg>
<seg id="3">As a gourmets, President Roosevelt had a faible for refined delicatessen on Fifth Avenue like Pâte de foie gras and Maryland terrapin soup.</seg>
<seg id="4">His menu on that day was a bit more modest: stuffed eggs in tomato sauce, mashed potatoes and as dessert a plum pudding.</seg>
<seg id="5">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "it was an act of culinary solidarity with suffering people," "" "" "" "said Jane Ziegelman." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="6">"" "" "" "her husband Andrew Coe added," "" "" "" "It was also a message to the Americans how they should eat." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="7">The couple lives in Brooklyn Heights and are both food historians.</seg>
<seg id="8">Coes last book "Chop Suey" was based on Chinese cuisine in the USA, while Ziegelman told in her book "97 Orchard" about life in a residential building on the Lower East Side of the food perspective.</seg>
<seg id="9">Their latest collaboration, "A decent meal," which will appear on Tuesday at Harper Verlag, illustrates the history of American cuisine during the Great Depression.</seg>
<seg id="10">They showed culinary solidarity when they met with a reporter at the Eisenberg's Sandwich Shop for dinner, a small, snorkel Imbiss in the Flatiron District, which has been in business since the crash crash in 1929.</seg>
<seg id="11">Brick kiln, 54, ordered a fresh cheese sandwich with olive pieces, while Coe, 57, turkey with mashed potatoes and vegetable mixture ate.</seg>
<seg id="12">When the reporter ordered hammering, this found the couple to discuss the food in the era of Great Depression.</seg>
<seg id="13">"rich foods were very popular," Ziegelman said.</seg>
<seg id="14">There was peanut bread, liver cheese and bean bread.</seg>
<seg id="15">They were made from an ingredient and a little cheaper that stretches the ingredient.</seg>
<seg id="16">Imagine eating so many peanuts that they serve them as dinner.</seg>
<seg id="17">CoE grinned.</seg>
<seg id="18">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "it must have been in the stomach such as lead," "" "" "" "he said." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="19">In the years before the Great Depression, the table was in an American budget, especially in rural areas, an all-you-Can-Eat buffet.</seg>
<seg id="20">Teams of women were cooking for male fellows and it was served freshly baked pastes for breakfast, lunch and dinner.</seg>
<seg id="21">It was the Americans who sent food to starving Europeans during the First World War. "a Square Meal" traces the roads with which the country was going to be no longer the land of land.</seg>
<seg id="22">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "it was a time when food was a central theme for the Americans," "" "" "" "Coe begged why he and his wife wanted to write about it." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="23">The new budget was just as tense: mysterious food such as breads and casseroles became staple food, reassuring the casserole dish as a "wonderful way, food leftovers," as chefs were able to hide appetizing ingredients under a creamy sauce.</seg>
<seg id="24">Fresh fruit was replaced by cheaper dry fruit.</seg>
<seg id="25">Meat that was the center of American cuisine for years became a rare luxury.</seg>
<seg id="26">Odd mixes have been tried as a calorie-rich and nutritious satisfaction predominates with taste or even healthy cuisine.</seg>
<seg id="27">While researching the book, which includes recipes, Ziegelman prepared a dish of this epoch, baked onions with peanut butter.</seg>
<seg id="28">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "it was not a popular addition to lunch," "" "" "" "says Coe." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="29">Ziegelman proceeds further: "it was surreal."</seg>
<seg id="30">Peanut butter and baked onions do not match each other.</seg>
<seg id="31">It was typical for many of the household recipes.</seg>
<seg id="32">As never before, or ever since, budget economists - including Louise Stanley, head of the Federal Bureau of Home Economics from 1923 to 1943 - performed the country's eating habits.</seg>
<seg id="33">By publishing recipes and articles in newspapers and magazines, they encouraged women to become "household politicians," and the challenge of converting Pampe like creamy spaghetti with carrots into delicious meals.</seg>
<seg id="34">"a Square Meal" is a feast of historic treats.</seg>
<seg id="35">Especially tasty are the reports about the response of the government to the starving citizens, as President Herbert Hoover's Lass-me-Cake-Food attitude.</seg>
<seg id="36">While he publicly praised the simple Iowa farm kitchen of his kitchen, he fed like the millionfold man of the world he became.</seg>
<seg id="37">"he liked continental cooking like fish with a cucumber sauce," Coe said.</seg>
<seg id="38">He ate in an almost gold-plated dining room and wore a tuxedo.</seg>
<seg id="39">He was delightfully realistic.</seg>
<seg id="40">President Roosevelt may have committed the same mistake if his wife Eleanor had asked him to make an example with his stomach.</seg>
<seg id="41">As described in the book, the director of a housekeeper with no interest in flavors caused by Mrs Roosevelt that the White House brought forth the most boring food in Washington, but also one of the most driest ones. "</seg>
<seg id="42">Many of the species from the era of Great Depression to deal with food was rejected once the land came back to the legs.</seg>
<seg id="43">The legacy lies on our continuing focus on calories and food, said Brickman, as well as how science was applied to food.</seg>
<seg id="44">The couple gave a better understanding of the eating habits of Ziegelman's mother-in-law when writing the book - for example how she could not throw away food.</seg>
<seg id="45">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "she had a real fear of food waste," "" "" "" "Coe said." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="46">"" "" "" "brick one remembered:" "" "" "" "she really made people sick." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="47">There was the windfall of the wind.</seg>
<seg id="48">After the dishes were cleared from Eisenberg's, they and Coe produced a dessert that they had prepared at home: the plum recipe that President Roosevelt ate for lunch.</seg>
<seg id="49">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "it is called Prune Whip," "" "" "" "said Brickman and added that it was a common trick to miss modest recipes." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="50">There was no whipped cream, only prunes, some flour, sugar, water and cinnamon.</seg>
<seg id="51">Everyone dipped something reluctantly a spoon in the tamed, brown glibber.</seg>
<seg id="52">Amazingly, it tasted not bad.</seg>

<seg id="1">Greenland shark: the oldest vertebrate is almost 400 years old</seg>
<seg id="2">Rare sight.</seg>
<seg id="3">Greenland's sharks usually come to the surface only in winter.</seg>
<seg id="4">After an investigation, this shark was allowed to return to the sea aboard the Sanna research vessel.</seg>
<seg id="5">It was born in 1624 and floats with a good 1 km / h through the North Atlantic - to this day.</seg>
<seg id="6">Greenland is only 150 years old.</seg>
<seg id="7">Leisurely the Greenland shark swims along the bottom of the North Atlantic, in one hour it reaches an average just 1,220 meters.</seg>
<seg id="8">Only when it counts, the five-metre-long animal accelerates to a full 2.6 km / h - and is half as fast as a seal with this top speed.</seg>
<seg id="9">This lifestyle shaped by slowness seems to be a recipe for a high age.</seg>
<seg id="10">Julius Nielsen from the University of Copenhagen and his colleagues reported in the journal "Science" at least a Greenland shark who could be 392 years old.</seg>
<seg id="11">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "insanity," "" "" "" "said Alexander Scheuerlein of the Max Planck Institute for demographic research in Rostock, this life span, which means a world record for vertebrates." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="12">The evolutionist biologist believed for a long time that Greenland is stony.</seg>
<seg id="13">Only lacked the evidence.</seg>
<seg id="14">Greenland is difficult to observe, after all, they live mainly in the ice sea in front of the thinly populated coasts of Canada, Greenland, Norway and Svalbard.</seg>
<seg id="15">Because they prefer water temperatures around the six degrees Celsius, they usually appear on the surface only in winter.</seg>
<seg id="16">Researchers know little about the lifestyle of Greenland.</seg>
<seg id="17">Their slow motion measures them, when they held six animals with a transmitter in front of Svalbard.</seg>
<seg id="18">Prey makes this sharks nevertheless: in the stomach of an animal researchers found the remains of a seal, another had swallowed the jaw bone of a young polar bear.</seg>
<seg id="19">They may hunt sleeping animals or patrol on the bottom of the ice-sea and look for cadaver, which torpedoes from higher water-layers down.</seg>
<seg id="20">Julius Nielsen and his colleagues now investigated 28 Greenland Fever, the fishermen between 2010 and 2013 brought to Greenland or Svalbard as bycatch from the depth of the North Atlantic.</seg>
<seg id="21">The smallest shark was just 81 cm long, while the biggest 502 centimeter measured.</seg>
<seg id="22">In order to determine the age of the animals, they analyzed the lens nucleus of the sharks with the carbon-14 method.</seg>
<seg id="23">This centre of the eye lens is created before the birth of the sharks, the proteins contained in it are later no longer redone.</seg>
<seg id="24">The two smallest sharks had remarkably much carbon-14 in the lens nucleus.</seg>
<seg id="25">Their birth should therefore be after the early 1960s, when nuclear weapons search increased large amounts of this radioactive carbon into the atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="26">In the third-smallest animal with 220 centimetres of length, the lens nucleus, on the other hand, contained a small excess of carbon-14 from nuclear weapons, so it is likely to have celebrated its 50th birthday in 2012.</seg>
<seg id="27">In their lenticular nucleus, however, all larger Greenland-haives had normal carbon-14 amounts created by cosmic rays in the atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="28">In fact, the carbon-14-clock showed an age of 335 centimetres for a 493 centimetre long Greenland shark, while the record Hai with 502 centimetres would be even 392 years old.</seg>
<seg id="29">That Greenland shark females only get offspring when they are longer than four meters, was known.</seg>
<seg id="30">Now the researchers were able to assign an age to the length.</seg>
<seg id="31">Since one of the animals with 392 centimetres probably stood at the threshold of the sexually mature and its age was determined at 156 years, Greenland haired with the increase obviously can be at least one and a half centuries.</seg>
<seg id="32">This is also likely to be world record for vertebrates.</seg>
<seg id="33">It is no coincidence that such metealisations live mainly in icy waters.</seg>
<seg id="34">The previous record holder, a 211 year old Greenland whale, in whose bacon at the neck had a 120-year-old harpoon tip, was caught in front of Alaska.</seg>
<seg id="35">Due to the low temperatures, the organism of the living animals often runs on asparagus flame.</seg>
<seg id="36">So they mature later - and age slowed down.</seg>
<seg id="37">In order to keep warm in the cold water, the animals are often particularly large.</seg>
<seg id="38">Because the volume grows much faster than its surface through which the animal gets heat.</seg>
<seg id="39">The loss of heat from one gram of mouse is therefore much larger than one gram of elephant.</seg>
<seg id="40">Another advantage: you have fewer enemies.</seg>
<seg id="41">"a smaller animal is therefore more dangerous and should concentrate on having as many offspring as possible," explains the evolutionist biologist Scheuerlein.</seg>
<seg id="42">A very big animal should, on the other hand, invest its resources into a long life.</seg>

<seg id="2">Hillary Clinton released its tax return for 2015 on Friday, which revealed an income of USD 10.75 million for the Presidential candidate of the Democrats and her husband and an effective federal tax rate of 34.2%.</seg>
<seg id="3">In 2015, the Clinton Foundation donated USD 1 million for charitable purposes, mainly to the Clinton Foundation; former Secretary of State Bill Clinton generated almost USD 5.3 million in oral speeches; the former Secretary of State issued an income of USD 3 million from the publishing house Simon & Schuster for their official time in the State Department.</seg>
<seg id="4">Clinton's candidate for Vice Presidency, Senator Tim kaine from Virginia, together with his wife Anne Holton, published his tax declarations for the last ten years.</seg>

<seg id="6">"Hillary Clinton and Tim kaine continue to set standards in terms of financial transparency," said Clinton's Campaign helper in Jennifer Palmieri in a statement.</seg>
<seg id="7">In a stark contrast, Donald Trump is hiding behind false statements and backs in reference to his previous promises to publish his tax returns.</seg>

<seg id="2">Conservationists in Tanzania use an unorthodox way to prevent elephants from walking in people inhabited settlements - they throw condoms on them that are filled with chilies.</seg>
<seg id="3">The method has proven to be effective and the Honeyguide Foundation, who had the idea already years ago, intensified their funding by training volunteers in villages in northern Tanzania to use a non-violent four-stage method to protect their homes and harvest without hurting animals.</seg>
<seg id="4">Before that, many spears used to defend themselves.</seg>
<seg id="5">Friday is a day of the World, dedicated to animal welfare.</seg>
<seg id="6">"since we have developed the... Toolkit, we were able to observe a change in attitudes within these communities, much more confident that they can stop the elephants from their fields without harm to the elephant," said Honeyguide Damian Bell's managing director in a message.</seg>
<seg id="7">The first two steps include the lightness of the elephant with a torch and the bubbles in a horn.</seg>
<seg id="8">If it is not deterred, a so-called "chime cloud" is thrown.</seg>
<seg id="9">Chilies mixed with earth is packed together with a firework body into a condom, whose end is turned to the ignition cord.</seg>
<seg id="10">When it is lit, the condom heats up with a bang and spray fine dust into the air.</seg>
<seg id="11">A breeze usually already looks out to chase the elephant.</seg>
<seg id="12">A last chance is a rower who shoots a fireworks fireworks in the air, causing a loud, bright explosion.</seg>

<seg id="2">The ministers from the pastoral care unit Eyachtal-Haigerloch St. Anna were on the way to Freiburg on a four-day pilgrimage route from Villingen to Freiburg.</seg>
<seg id="3">Together, four stages were dealt with.</seg>
<seg id="4">In order to bridge the time to the next Romantic pilgrimage of all ministers in the course of two years, the round of the ministries of St. Anna has decided to prepare and carry out a multi-day pilgrimage.</seg>
<seg id="5">Various pilgrimage destinations were examined and it was finally decided for the Bishop's City of Fribourg, where during this year's Holy Year of Mercy, a special pilgrimage was offered to the open gate of Mercy on Fribourg cathedral.</seg>
<seg id="6">16 Minis of Bittelbronn, and Greol, and Haigerloch, and Heiligenstadt, went their way.</seg>
<seg id="7">In the evening, pastor Storost sent out the Pilgrims in a small celebration in St. Anna, blessed the Pilgrimage and told the Pilgrims.</seg>
<seg id="8">From Horb it was driven by train to the starting point of Villingen, where also a Münster University of Our Lady stands and so the pilgrimage route from Münster was started.</seg>
<seg id="9">The individual day tours were framed in the morning and evening, accompanied by a short impulse with various prayers, songs and written texts.</seg>
<seg id="10">But also on the way, the Minis repeatedly made a rest at the field crossings, chapels or churches to sing together a song from a specially assembled pilgrim song booklet.</seg>
<seg id="11">For the overnight stays the parish communities of the local parishes were available.</seg>
<seg id="12">At the stage destinations Alexandra Burkhardt and Heidi Faller took care of a tasty and tonic dinner and breakfast.</seg>
<seg id="13">We continued on the second day via Furtwangen to Gütenbach.</seg>
<seg id="14">The next day we stepped up the stage to St. Peter, which was the most exhausting stretch of road, but at first we had to overcome some 500 metres altitude and then climbed up again.</seg>
<seg id="15">The deserved reward was a joint barbecue at the bath house in the evening.</seg>
<seg id="16">After the morning impulse on the fourth pilgrimage day in the impressive monastery church of St. Peter we went to the final stage to Freiburg.</seg>
<seg id="17">The Minis also visibly relieved and happily arrived at the Freiburg Minster in the late afternoon and passed through the gates of mercy.</seg>
<seg id="18">With a little impulse, God was given thanks.</seg>
<seg id="19">At the evening Mass in Münster, the Minis welcomed by Kooperator Markus Obert were welcomed.</seg>
<seg id="20">After the divine service, the pilgrims were able to visit the sacristy and the high altar.</seg>
<seg id="21">The next day was still time for the Breisgau Metropolis.</seg>
<seg id="22">In the afternoon we went back to Horb by train.</seg>
<seg id="23">At the end, all participants agreed that the days of spirituality and a strong community experience were shaped.</seg>

<seg id="2">Scottish Callum Skinner razed last night in the men's team-sprint in the Velodrom in Rio for fame when the British team defended the title of London 2012.</seg>
<seg id="3">The 23-year-old from Glasgow took the anchor, which his compatriot Sir Chris Hoy had made himself to Eigen. the Junction made the legend haughty when he stormed his home to collect a victory from the favorites of New Zealand.</seg>
<seg id="4">England claimed a shocking victory four years ago, while Hoy took the fifth of six Olympic medals.</seg>
<seg id="5">They repeated the trick after they got only a modest sixth place in March at the London Underground World Championships in London.</seg>
<seg id="6">The problem between Beijing and London was the replacement of the driver Jamie staff.</seg>
<seg id="7">They did this in good time as an executor.</seg>
<seg id="8">His retirement created a gap that Kian Emadi and Matt Crampton tried to close.</seg>
<seg id="9">Skinner was the man with whom they stayed as they saw potential in the shotting that has now unfolded.</seg>
<seg id="10">Hindes, Kenny - four years ago with Hoy won - and Skinner used an Olympic tournament in the qualification rounds, but in the standard rounds, the New Zealand won in the first round.</seg>
<seg id="11">And the British trio won the duel with gold.</seg>
<seg id="12">After his lap he fell short, but Kenny brought the team forward and Skinner held it.</seg>
<seg id="13">A change of strategy made a large part of the transformation, when Hindes went in a higher gear to slow down it and allow Kenny and above all Skinner to keep the pace.</seg>
<seg id="14">Hoy watched from his position as BBC expert and fell on Skinner, Kenny and Hindes when they got on the podium.</seg>
<seg id="15">"" "" "" "the 23 year old Skinner from Glasgow said:" "" "" "" "it's a flattering comparison." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="16">I'm just here to do my best and make a name for me.</seg>
<seg id="17">We placed an Olympic-ord in the final round and defeated the world champions.</seg>
<seg id="18">It was just unbelievable.</seg>
<seg id="19">There is no better way to win this.</seg>
<seg id="20">After the triumph in 2012 at the side Kenny and Hoys, Hinder admitted that after a weak start he fell on the track deliberately.</seg>
<seg id="21">He withdrew this statement later and there was no objection from England's rivals.</seg>
<seg id="22">With such an outstanding victory this time there was no such problem.</seg>
<seg id="23">"" "" "" "she said," "" "" "" "It feels like London with all the UK flags on the tribune." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="24">We have come together in the last three months as a team.</seg>
<seg id="25">We did so badly with so many world titles that it was incredible to win again at the Olympics.</seg>
<seg id="26">This is an event, a gold medal for the nation winning seven out of 10 titles both in Beijing and London.</seg>
<seg id="27">If that is a barometer of our progress in the last five months, we expect a successful five days in the Velodrom.</seg>
<seg id="28">With the form Kenny, it is in the realm of the possible that he repeats Hoys's victory of three Olympic gold medals in a contest.</seg>
<seg id="29">This would be for Kenny - exactly 12 years younger than Hoy who was born on 23 March (a seemingly sacred date for British sport; on the day Steve Redmond, Mo Farah and Roger Bannister were born) - a yield of six gold medals and a silver medal.</seg>
<seg id="30">This would be equal to that of Hoy.</seg>
<seg id="31">Kenny takes part in the sprint now starting today and going for three days.</seg>
<seg id="32">"" "" "" "the 28-year-old from Bolton said:" "" "" "" "I just enjoy this for the moment." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="34">You can win it with your colleagues.</seg>
<seg id="35">It feels a bit lonely to win alone.</seg>
<seg id="36">"" "" "" "he said," "" "" "" "If he wins two gold medals, he should be beaten to the knight." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="37">It was the only medal competition of the day, but there were other good news for England.</seg>
<seg id="38">Sir Bradly Wiggins, Ed Clancy, Steven Burke and Owain Doull qualified with the fastest performance in the four-kilometer race.</seg>
<seg id="39">They arrived in 3: 51,942.</seg>
<seg id="40">The world record, which won Gold in 2012 in London, was at 3: 51,659.</seg>
<seg id="41">The first and final round (22.42) will take place on the second day of the competition, where Wiggins will focus on safety.</seg>
<seg id="42">He was contested yesterday with officials before the qualification, when officials called him to measure his height.</seg>
<seg id="43">In the appropriate women's competition, which will be continued and finished tomorrow, Laura Trott, Joanna Rowel Shand, Elinor Barker and Katie Archibald of Milngavie became world record time in 4: 13,260.</seg>
<seg id="44">The UK team relies on its strong rail team to dominate the middle period of the Olympic Games and to pick up a crowd of medals.</seg>
<seg id="45">After a truly exceptional representation of absolute dominance in Beijing and London, the expectations for Rio were shut down.</seg>
<seg id="46">In April, Dramas dropped off in the background, so Shane Sutton's technical director resigned in April amid sexism and mobbing as well as the retirement of sizes such as Hoy and Victoria Pendleton.</seg>
<seg id="47">But if one looks at the first evening of the competition in the Velodrom, it looks quite as if the now legendary reputation GBs, which has reached its peak at the perfect moment, will be repeated again.</seg>

<seg id="2">The future of the aluminium melts of Portland in Victoria - as well as hundreds of workstations of workers - are at stake, as the plant operator terminates the energy supply contract and thereby elevates all supply contracts as the delivering energy company communicates.</seg>
<seg id="3">This step followed the decision of the government in Victoria at the beginning of this year to grant no further subsidies to the operation of the plant.</seg>
<seg id="4">A subsidy set for 20 years is underway in November.</seg>
<seg id="5">Up to 2,000 jobs in the Alcoa plant in Portland are at stake.</seg>
<seg id="6">Not less than 2000 jobs -direct as well as indirect - could be at risk in a closure.</seg>
<seg id="7">In addition, it could come to domino effects as the melting process consumes around 10 percent of the total power generation of Victorias.</seg>
<seg id="8">In 2014 Alcoa closed the point Henry melt, leading to closure of the Anglesea power plant last year.</seg>
<seg id="9">Alcoa's smelting in Portland loses money and risks a closure.</seg>
<seg id="10">This step follows the years of speculation with regard to the future of the plant, originally as a result of the strong Australian dollar and last due to the electricity price for the plant.</seg>
<seg id="11">AGL, supplying the large aluminium melei with its Loy Yang A power plant in Latrobe Valley, announced that three other owners will announce their contracts.</seg>
<seg id="12">The plant is owned by a joint venture between Alcoa and Alumina, of which the Chinese company CITIC and the Japanese Marubeni Corp hold smaller portions.</seg>

<seg id="19">Alcoa said that the decision to book the Treaties, the "Ability of Alcoas"... to operate the melt or to ensure the power supply to the melt "does not interfere.</seg>

<seg id="2">Kendall Jenner, 20, Model and fourth daughter of the manager and mother of the Kardashian Jenner clan, Kris is on the cover of the coveted September edition of the U.S. Vogue.</seg>
<seg id="3">Kendall, the brand ambassador of Estee Lauder, and on the Fashion Weeks in Milan, Paris and New York, announced on Thursday the news on her Instagram account.</seg>
<seg id="4">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "in a room full of people I love, the sight of this cover made me cry," "" "" "" "Kendall wrote." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="5">The cover of the cover followed a bizarre (or simply keeping Up with the Kardashyans similar?), crawling reality video showing the entire Kardashyan Jenner family (with the exception of the problem cases Rob and Caitlyn) as well as in the presence of the most popular show biz uncle and producers of keeping Up Ryan Seacrest), which ends with a classical twist: they all have planned a surprise party.</seg>
<seg id="6">This is the stereotyped plot of almost every birthday septode for a children's show (Seacrest brought the sentence, "You thought we had forgotten you?," with the honesty of a cartoon on a slot at 8 o'clock in the morning), but Kris had to let her other girls take part in this publicity.</seg>
<seg id="7">With regard to the September issue of the Vogue a new era of cartography has certainly begun.</seg>
<seg id="8">Kendall's big sister Kim might have beaten her regarding the Vogue cover (she and her husband Kanye West were on it in April 2014), but the cover of the September issue of the magazine is a league for itself.</seg>
<seg id="9">The September edition is the most sold edition of the year for Vogue.</seg>
<seg id="10">With a circumference resembling an image band as a fashion magazine, the output draws a large number of advertisers (aut Fashionista were from the 832 pages of the ramdisk 615 pages advertisement).</seg>
<seg id="11">The unveiling of his cover star is so eagerly awaited that in the last two years, pictures of the magazine leaked before the official announcement.</seg>
<seg id="12">Women who were already on the cover include Naomi Campbell, Linda Evangelista and Kate Moss.</seg>
<seg id="13">In recent years there have been more "celebrities who mock" as "models, the celebrities are" on the cover.</seg>
<seg id="14">Oscar winner and Dior brand ambassador Jennifer Lawrence was on the cover in 2013, one year after Lady Gaga had the honour.</seg>
<seg id="15">But even with the little chance that Mrs. Jenner - who is described by the magazine as the "breakthrough model" of her generation - falls below the earlier category, she is in good company.</seg>
<seg id="16">These celebrities are not related to famous people or reality stars or youngsters of today who know how to turn a good Snapchat video (even though everything applies to Jenner).</seg>
<seg id="17">They are really talented women who are in the entertainment industry.</seg>
<seg id="18">Beyonce, who appeared on the last cover, had one of the most successful years of her career with the release of Lemonade.</seg>
<seg id="19">Of course Jenners' success doesn't like everyone.</seg>
<seg id="20">With her reality TV history Jenners's position in the world of fashion was always a bit tense.</seg>
<seg id="21">In June, the former Victoria's Secret model Stephanie Seymour Jenner and her colleague Gigi Hadid criticized them and called them "the Mistresses of the Eye."</seg>
<seg id="22">These feelings cook up again when the news came out with the appearance of Jenners on the Vogue Cover.</seg>
<seg id="23">But lying around on the mism seems to pass by the point.</seg>
<seg id="24">Kendall Jenner is on the cover of the September edition of Vogue.</seg>
<seg id="25">It is a supermodel in the truest sense of the word.</seg>
<seg id="26">She runs for Marc Jacobs.</seg>
<seg id="27">It makes advertising for your primer of Estee Lauder.</seg>
<seg id="28">You and all your sisters sell pictures of themselves on their respective paywall apps.</seg>
<seg id="29">She sells her own pictures of Cindy Crawfords's daughter to the magazine LOVE.</seg>

<seg id="6">The director of the Queesland James Farrell National Councils said that the last survey of the National Association of Common Market Centres revealed that thousands of people are rejected every year.</seg>

<seg id="10">The Federal Government will cut the funding by 30 percent as of June 2017, which means that thousands of people in need of help from Queensland will be forced to cope with their legal problems without any help.</seg>

<seg id="2">In the upcoming elections in the federal states of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern (September 4) and Berlin (September 18) considerable losses for the governing party SPD and CDU are notable.</seg>
<seg id="3">This resulted in representative surveys from the Insa opinion research institute for the Bild-Zeitung (Friday).</seg>
<seg id="4">While the red-black government coalition could continue to govern in the north, this is not possible after the survey values in Berlin.</seg>
<seg id="5">In both federal states, the SPD would be the strongest party and would have good chances of continuing to face the head of government.</seg>
<seg id="6">In Mecklenburg-Vorpommern the SPD fell from 35.6 percent five years ago to 24 percent.</seg>
<seg id="7">According to the survey, the party was only smiling just ahead of the CDU, which could return to 23 percent again.</seg>
<seg id="8">The third place is disputed between the left and the AfD.</seg>
<seg id="9">The left would be 19 percent (before 18.4 percent), the AfD would represent 19 percent for the first time in the Landtag.</seg>
<seg id="10">Despite a slight loss of 6 per cent (previous 8.7 per cent), the Greens moved back to Schwerin Landtag.</seg>
<seg id="11">NPD and FDP would not be represented in the Landtag with 3 per cent respectively.</seg>
<seg id="12">According to the survey, the SPD of the Berlin Chamber of Deputies would only return to 23 per cent (election 2011: 28.3 percent).</seg>
<seg id="13">The CDU only reached 18 percent after 23.4 percent.</seg>
<seg id="14">They thus still lie behind the Greens with 19 percent (2011: 17.6 percent), but before the left with 15 percent (previously 11.7 percent).</seg>
<seg id="15">The AfD would represent 14 percent for the first time in the House of Representatives.</seg>

<seg id="2">E-Mail and Internet in slow motion: 20 years ago the Nokia Communicator came to the market.</seg>
<seg id="3">The successors dominate the world today - its manufacturer experienced a disaster.</seg>
<seg id="4">The tool weighed almost half a kilogram and was more than four times as heavy as an iPhone 5.</seg>
<seg id="5">It was thicker and bigger, therefore it was not good in the hand.</seg>
<seg id="6">On the contrary, it was rather bulky.</seg>
<seg id="7">The built-in memory was initially eight megabytes, which would be a high resolution for about two selfies today.</seg>
<seg id="8">An iPhone is now supplied with at least 16 gigabytes.</seg>
<seg id="9">The Nokia 9000 Communicator came to business exactly 20 years ago, on August 15th, 1996 - and it was the first smartphone.</seg>
<seg id="10">For a few euros, fans can still buy the devices on the Internet, but they somehow come from the Stone Age of the internet era.</seg>
<seg id="11">20 years ago, however, the communicator was a sensation.</seg>
<seg id="12">The Finnish mobile phone manufacturer announced the product a few months earlier at the computer fair Cebit in Hanover as "office in western pocket format."</seg>
<seg id="13">In fact, the new mobile phone could be sent and received for then standards: SMS and emails could be sent and received, even by fax the communicator was to be reached.</seg>
<seg id="14">Even the access to web pages was possible via HTML-Browser, albeit quelly slow.</seg>
<seg id="15">A calculator was available, a digital address book and an electronic calendar.</seg>
<seg id="16">There was a small antenna, and the mobile phone could be folded like a laptop.</seg>
<seg id="17">Then we found a small keyboard and a black-and-white screen.</seg>
<seg id="18">Quite proud was the price: 2700 D-Mark, i.e. about 1400 Euros.</seg>
<seg id="19">The average selling price of a smartphone in Germany was 392 euros in 2015.</seg>
<seg id="20">No one could suspect in August 1996 that the communicator would become the beginning of the smartphone era.</seg>
<seg id="21">Since then everything is different.</seg>
<seg id="22">Smart phones are a success story, even if not for Nokia.</seg>
<seg id="23">Finns's mobile phone division experienced an unprecedented disaster, eventually sold and handled to Microsoft.</seg>
<seg id="24">The market today dominate providers who all came a lot later than Nokia.</seg>
<seg id="25">Ever and everywhere, this is everyday life for a lot of people.</seg>
<seg id="26">In 2015, there were nearly two billion smart phones worldwide.</seg>
<seg id="27">About 1.4 billion units sold, Samsung and Apple accounted for 555 million units of this alone.</seg>
<seg id="28">Worldwide sales are around 400 billion euros.</seg>
<seg id="29">This includes the well-running business of the countless app providers and telecommunications companies.</seg>

<seg id="31">The decisive breakthrough to the mass market was only beginning at the beginning of 2007, at that time Apple CEO Steve Jobs announced the launch of the iPhones on the Mac World.</seg>
<seg id="32">He promised three devices in one: a music player, a telephone and an internet communicator, all via touch screen easy to use.</seg>
<seg id="33">Apple's triumphal march began, and today the iPhone is the company's most important product.</seg>
<seg id="34">Nokia, Motorola and Blackberry, who ruled the market, had a look.</seg>
<seg id="35">They eventually disappeared, Blackberry has to fight.</seg>
<seg id="36">The Says now have Apple and Asian providers like Samsung.</seg>
<seg id="37">The smartphone is a matter of course for 20 years after its invention.</seg>

<seg id="2">Heathrow will bring renewal and prosperity not only in our local communities and throughout London, but throughout the country.</seg>
<seg id="3">For me it was the biggest attraction of Heathrows, just like at that time in 2012 in London, when we had a great effort to make sure all our nations and regions benefited from the games.</seg>
<seg id="4">The Olympics brought great benefits to Stratford and the East End.</seg>
<seg id="5">And that will be achieved by creating new opportunities for local residents and companies near Heathrow.</seg>
<seg id="6">We will create 10,000 new jobs for our local communities alone, create 40,000 new jobs and put an end to youth unemployment in the airport.</seg>
<seg id="7">As they were ahead of us in London 2012, there will be those who will think that the challenge of expanding Heathrow is too great.</seg>
<seg id="8">I was told that England will never be ready for the games and that we will be blinking on the world stage.</seg>
<seg id="9">The doubts were wrong in 2012 and they will also be wrong with Heathrow.</seg>
<seg id="10">There are always obstacles to overcoming, but Heathrow answers any question asked.</seg>
<seg id="11">Like the Olympic Games, Heathrow is for many and not for individual an infrastructure project.</seg>
<seg id="12">Enlargement is a way to create up to 180,000 new jobs, £211 billion in funny growth and to leave a legacy of skills and jobs both at the airport and in the UK.</seg>
<seg id="13">We have a great team in Heathrow, which has implemented a £11 billion expensive infrastructure investment program in time and budget from the T5 - the five years in a row to the world's best airport terminal, up to the T2, which was built in the middle of the two most frequented walkways in the world.</seg>
<seg id="14">Now they are ready to deliver a third catwalk, which is supported by £16 billion invested in private investment.</seg>
<seg id="15">The London Games of 2012 were a great success for GB and I am confident that Heathrow's expansion will also be one.</seg>

<seg id="2">For companies that earn money with online advertising, try to circumvent ad blocking according to one of the software vendors, a "cat and mouse game."</seg>
<seg id="3">On Thursday, just two days after Facebook announced that ad lockings were blocked on its desktop page, Adblock Plus published a blog post in which users could update their filters in the program to block ads on the social network again.</seg>
<seg id="4">On Tuesday, Facebook announced that its desktop site would change the coding for its adverts to make it more difficult to detect what part of the site advertising is.</seg>
<seg id="5">But Adblock announced that it has found a new way to bypass the new codes.</seg>
<seg id="6">In a blog post, the spokesman of Adblock Ben Williams wrote that "this kind of Hin-and-Her struggle is underway between the opening open source community and the converters since the invention of display lockers," and that it is possible that Facebook soon comes with a new solution.</seg>
<seg id="7">The fact that the world's largest social media company has entered the fight is a strong indication of how alarming display lockers for the industry have become.</seg>
<seg id="8">According to a study published last year by Pagefair and Adobe around 200 million people worldwide use display lockers; nearly four times as much in 2013.</seg>
<seg id="9">With 1.03 billion daily active users accessing Facebook across their mobile devices, mobile advertising accounts for 84 percent of advertising revenues.</seg>
<seg id="10">Apart from the fact that mobile ad blocker has no effect on Facebook's mobile app for the social network and Instagram, the company announced that it has no effect on the social network and Instagram.</seg>
<seg id="11">Advertising on the desktop PC accounts for a sufficient amount of income so Facebook appears to be worthwhile for the investment of such a step.</seg>
<seg id="12">On Tuesday, Facebook announced that it would update its "Ad Preference Tool" to give people more control over their targeted advertising.</seg>
<seg id="13">On Thursday Facebook claimed that new filters would be worrying new filters because they would block content on the site that are not advertising.</seg>
<seg id="14">"this is not a positive experience for users, so we plan to address the problem," a Facebook Spokesperson told us in an email message.</seg>
<seg id="15">Ad blockers are a blunt tool, which is why we have concentrated on developing tools such as Ad Preferences to put more control into the hands of people.</seg>

<seg id="4">The incident occurred on the A1 near Morges in the canton of Vaud shortly after midnight.</seg>

<seg id="2">According to projections of a new NASA climate model, Venus probably was once inhabitable.</seg>
<seg id="3">Scientists at the Goddard Institute for Space Studies from NASA developed a model to explore the past of Venus based on tools and algorithms that resemble those of climate scientists.</seg>
<seg id="4">The model was designed to determine whether Venus could have rejected similar conditions with its hot, waterless surface and CO2-dense atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="5">Scientists have previously indicated that the slow rotation of Venus could be explained by its dense atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="6">But the most recent simulation indicates that Venus could have had a thin, erdlike atmosphere and slowly rotated.</seg>
<seg id="7">The model also illuminated the topography of the early Venus.</seg>
<seg id="8">The planet probably showed more dry areas than the Earth, but once had enough water and geographical variability to accommodate lives and protected against fast evaporation.</seg>
<seg id="9">The early Venus also benefited from a Sun that was 30 percent weaker.</seg>
<seg id="10">"in the GISS model simulation, the slow rotation of Venus asserts its day-side of the sun for almost two months," says GISS scientist Anthony Del Genio in a press release.</seg>
<seg id="11">This warms the surface and produces rain that creates a thick layer of clouds which acts like an umbrella to shield the surface from much of the solar heat.</seg>
<seg id="12">The results are average temperatures, which are some degrees cooler than that of the Earth today.</seg>
<seg id="13">The model produced a history of Venus, similar to evolution that had previously been suspected by planet researchers.</seg>
<seg id="14">Although it was probably inhabitable, Venus was exposed to too much heat and ultraviolet light in the course of several billions of years.</seg>
<seg id="15">Their oceans evaporated and their water vapor was burned away by ultraviolet light.</seg>
<seg id="16">As their Hydrogen withdrew only a thick atmosphere of carbon dioxide returned with a deadly greenhouse effect -- the Venus, which as we know it today.</seg>

<seg id="2">The latest mission with the Kepler WelSpace Telescope has helped astronomers to collect the most complete catalogue of rotational rates among the stars of the constellation of the Pleiades.</seg>
<seg id="3">The new data will help the astronomers understand why stars in the star-pile rotate to different rates, as well as in what context rotational periods are associated with planetary origin.</seg>
<seg id="4">"we hope that by comparing our results with other stars, we will learn more about the relationship between the mass of a star, its age and even the history of its solar system," said Luisa Rebull, a researcher at Caltech's Infrared Processing and Analysis Center in Pasadena, in a press release.</seg>
<seg id="5">The cluster of the Pleiades lies 445 lightyears distant from the Earth.</seg>
<seg id="6">Many stars in this cluster of stars, which originated some 125 million years ago, now reach adulthood.</seg>
<seg id="7">They are now turning the fastest.</seg>
<seg id="8">At peak rotational rates these ripening stars bump large amounts of star winds.</seg>
<seg id="9">Since these winds travel through the magnetic fields of the stars, they have a braking effect on the stars.</seg>
<seg id="10">When a star age, its rotation rate begins to slow down.</seg>
<seg id="11">Kepler measures the rotation rate of each star by recognizing the time between the appearance of a recognizable star spot -- such as sunspots.</seg>
<seg id="12">The latest catalogue of rotational rates indicates that more massive stars turn slower than less massive stars.</seg>
<seg id="13">Rebull compares stars with dancers, whereas larger stars turn slower pirouettes than smaller ones.</seg>
<seg id="14">"in the" Ballet "of the Pleiades we see that slow rotors tend to be massive whereas faster rotors tend to be very bright stars," Rebull said.</seg>
<seg id="15">Since the cluster of the Pleiades is so close, it serves as an ideal cosmic laboratory to compare stellar qualities such as rotational rates.</seg>
<seg id="16">"the cluster of the Pleiades provides an anchor for theoretical models of stellar rotation in both directions, younger and older," Rebull said.</seg>
<seg id="17">There is still much ahead of us what we would like to learn more about how, when and why stars slow down their rotational rates, and so to speak, hang up their "dance shoes."</seg>

<seg id="1">Olympics 2016: chen Xinyi, Silwia Danekova and Adrian Severin Zielinski are the first doping cases</seg>
<seg id="2">Caught: because of a positive doping test, Weightlifter Adrian Severin Zielinski is not allowed to start from Poland in Rio.</seg>
<seg id="3">Rio de Janeiro - The 2016 Olympic Games are overshadowed by the first official doping cases.</seg>
<seg id="4">A well-known athlete would have won almost a medal.</seg>
<seg id="5">Before the seventh race day, the first official doping cases have become known as the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro.</seg>
<seg id="6">The Chinese float in Chen Xinyi, 3000-metre barrier-runner in Silwia Danekova from Bulgaria and Polish weightlifter Adrian Severin Zielinski were positively tested in Brazil and excluded - immediately before the start of the athletics competitions that are critical of the competition, these news come to naught.</seg>
<seg id="7">In Chen last Sunday the diuretic hydrochlorothiazide was detected, which is used as a masking agent for doping substances.</seg>
<seg id="8">The International Sport Court (CAS) confirmed their expulsion from the Olympic Games on Friday afternoon.</seg>
<seg id="9">On Sunday the 18-year-old took fourth place in the final over 100 m of butterflies, only about 0.09 seconds she missed the bronze medal.</seg>
<seg id="10">On Friday Chen would have had to take part in the events of more than 50 m Freestyle.</seg>

<seg id="13">For the first time in history, the IOC is no longer responsible for the sanctioning of athletes with positive cases.</seg>
<seg id="14">Also in the night of Rio the news spread over the positive rehearsal at Danekova, the 33-year-old went on to the offensive.</seg>

<seg id="17">According to the report, the banned substances are to act as EPO blood doping agents.</seg>
<seg id="18">Danekova has been suspended for the time being, according to BNT, the B-sample has already been positive.</seg>
<seg id="19">Bulgaria's Prime Minister Boyko Borissov immediately informed himself with criticism of the athlete.</seg>
<seg id="20">"I don't understand why athletes don't draw the right conclusions," he said: "we Bulgarians are under observation, so many have already been excluded."</seg>
<seg id="21">For example, all weightlifters from the chronically doping nation are not allowed to take part in Rio.</seg>
<seg id="22">On Friday the case of "Adrian Perinski," the London Olympic Champion in the class up to 85 kg, was tested positively on the anabolic steroid Nandrolon three days before.</seg>

<seg id="1">Data theft: so perfide blackmail her ransom</seg>
<seg id="2">Programmers of blackmail malware are currently targeting companies - and are successful.</seg>
<seg id="3">According to a recent survey by the malware protection specialists Malwarebytes under 540 companies in North America, Great Britain and Germany, 40 percent of the surveyed companies in the past twelve months have been at least once, sometimes multiple victims of an attack with blackmail software.</seg>
<seg id="4">In Germany, almost 20 percent of the companies were already the target of a ransomware blackmail.</seg>
<seg id="5">40 percent of the victims willingly paid the ransom required by the perpetrators in order to be able to use the challenged systems and data again.</seg>
<seg id="6">The perpetrators specialize their blackmail software according to the observations of Malwarebytes as a result of attacks in company networks.</seg>
<seg id="7">If they are successful there, the potential to be blackout ransom is considerably higher than for private users.</seg>
<seg id="8">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "we are currently watching a frightening rapid evolution of malware," "" "" "" "says Malwarebytes leader Marcin Kleczynski talking to the" "" "" "" "world." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="9">In 2008, most of the Malwareprograms were still designed to send advertising.</seg>
<seg id="10">Then the perpetrators discovered blackmail software for themselves.</seg>
<seg id="11">Only private users were the target, but the change to company attaches took place in recent months terribly fast.</seg>
<seg id="12">Ransomware works according to a simple pattern: once on the computer of a victim, it searches for recently changed files such as Word-, Excel or database files as well as archives of images and videos.</seg>
<seg id="13">These files encrypt the ransomware and erase the originals sustainably.</seg>
<seg id="14">The software then presents the demands of blackmail presses.</seg>
<seg id="15">To get the final key code to the files, the victims need to transfer money - mostly in the form of cryptocurrency Bitcoin.</seg>
<seg id="16">But where private users use the personal photo database on the game, companies are dealing with sensitive customer data or project databases without the production being shut down.</seg>
<seg id="17">Accordingly, the damage occurs when a ransomware strikes.</seg>
<seg id="18">22 percent of the German companies affected reported sales losses due to Ransomware, 13 percent even had to stop business completely, in one case people were in danger of life.</seg>
<seg id="19">Several hospitals in Germany have already been victims of attacks whose patients can be acutely threatened by the loss of medical records.</seg>
<seg id="20">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "we always say to the victims," "" "" "" "does not pay, it only encourages the problem," "" "" "" "explains Kleczynski." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="21">But 80 to 90 percent of the companies that pay, get their data back.</seg>
<seg id="22">For managers it is difficult to reject the claim of perpetrators in the face of a standstill in operation.</seg>
<seg id="23">The hackers again know that and try everything to build a good reputation.</seg>
<seg id="24">In a recent study, the security researchers of F-Secure analyzed the benefits and contact with the blackmail and come to the conclusion: the perpetrators actually try to build a kind of customer service to get more money.</seg>
<seg id="25">They explain to their victims via chat how they can pay via Bitcoin, set up freely available support websites or decrypt for free example files.</seg>
<seg id="26">And if private persons are redeemed for payments of a few hundred euros, companies have to bargain some hard and pay five-digit sums in order to get their data returned unencrypted.</seg>
<seg id="27">In view of potentially high and relatively risk-free profits from the ransomware blackmail, hackers are becoming more and more professional and share their work, explains Security Experts Chester Wisniewski of the antivirus provider SOPHOS: "a single person can write a ransomware circa within a week."</seg>
<seg id="28">However, it is more likely that these are three or four people.</seg>
<seg id="29">The programmers then sell their malware in the form of a software toolbox to the actual blackmail presses.</seg>
<seg id="30">The malware kit has been developed by buying malware yourself, advising and providing additional tools for a unique, fixed price between 1000 and 10,000 dollars.</seg>
<seg id="31">"included is a fitting tool so that smaller configurations, appearance and branding can be changed," says Wisniewski.</seg>
<seg id="32">The blackmailers then search for further hackers to spread the newly purchased software among the victims.</seg>
<seg id="33">We live in a service industry.</seg>
<seg id="34">So one logs in one of the underground forums, buys the set of a criminal and commissions one another to install the software on as many PCs as possible.</seg>
<seg id="35">Payment is made per infected host.</seg>
<seg id="36">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "usually the criminals employ spammers with the spread," "" "" "" "explains Wisniewski." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="37">The risk of ransomware is now well-known in many companies that better protect their data.</seg>
<seg id="38">More than 50 percent of the companies IT leaders in the Malwarebytes survey rely on resisting ransomware by means of file back-ups and scanner software.</seg>
<seg id="39">Accordingly, the perpetrators are already pursuing new strategies.</seg>
<seg id="40">"if data encryption alone is not a sufficient threat to successful edification, the perpetrators are threatening to publish sensitive data such as customer lists or pricing strategies," explains Malwarebytes leader Marcin Kleczynski.</seg>
<seg id="41">This means that the damage potential, depending on the type of data, is much higher than before.</seg>
<seg id="42">In the future, the perpetrators will also be able to take on entirely new targets on the internet of things.</seg>
<seg id="43">At the Hackerkonferenz, Defcon, security researchers demonstrated how they could get a thermostat connected to the Internet under their control.</seg>
<seg id="44">In the middle of winter, the activation of such a blocked heating could be worth a ransom.</seg>
<seg id="45">If the perpetrators then block a whole production line in a factory instead of the heating in the future, Ransomware could also be a topic in Industry 4.0.</seg>

<seg id="1">One for all cases</seg>
<seg id="2">Honda HR-V is flexible and suitable for everyday use</seg>
<seg id="3">In the small HR-V, Honda wants to pack everything: a little SUV, a little coupe and the versatility of a minivans.</seg>
<seg id="4">Sounds rather overloaded, but the HR-V, which was constructed on the same new platform as the new jazz, actually proves to be extremely flexible in everyday life.</seg>
<seg id="5">Although the HR-V is only 1.60 m tall, the passengers have a lot of space both in the first row and in the rear, it does not work in any place.</seg>
<seg id="6">The materials of the interior are well finished and pleasant, only the cockpit-top falls down somewhat.</seg>
<seg id="7">The HR-V is more versatile than comparable vehicles for storage.</seg>
<seg id="8">There is not only a boot space of 453 l for raised and 1026 l in reversed backrests, but there is the "Magic Seats."</seg>
<seg id="9">This is less magical than it sounds: the seat surfaces of the back bench can be folded up like a cinema chair and thus offer storage space, which is 1.24 m high from the floor to the ceiling.</seg>
<seg id="10">The trunk can be loaded well, but the load height is 650 mm higher than the comparable Peugeot 2008.</seg>
<seg id="11">The tested 1.6-liter diesel with 88 kW / 120 hp accelerates the HR-V very powerfully thanks to the torque of up to 300 Nm in wide speed ranges.</seg>
<seg id="12">However, he is likely to do his work more quietly.</seg>
<seg id="13">The daily consumption of 4.7 l / 100 km is pleasing.</seg>
<seg id="14">There is another engine: a 1.5-litre petrol engine with 96 kW / 130 hp.</seg>
<seg id="15">An all-wheel drive is not offered.</seg>
<seg id="16">The handling is balanced, a good compromise between dynamism and comfort.</seg>
<seg id="17">But the steering should be a bit more direct.</seg>
<seg id="18">"" "" "" "the equipment leaves nothing to be desired in the tested" "" "" "" "Executive" "" "" "" "top variant." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="19">The safety systems include the City emergency brake assist (works up to speed 32), the collision warning system and the lane support assistant.</seg>
<seg id="20">The collision warning sometimes irritates because when maneuvering, he assesses many obstacles as "approaching objects."</seg>
<seg id="21">The remote light assistant works very reliably.</seg>
<seg id="22">And the intelligent speed controller reacts to the traffic sign recognition and throttles the speed when needed.</seg>
<seg id="23">But full connectivity is available only for the top features: 7-inch touchscreen, navigation system, app integration and more.</seg>
<seg id="24">Two USB- and one HDMI socket are below the armrest and are therefore somewhat cumbersome to achieve.</seg>
<seg id="25">The roughly 29,000 euros for the well-equipped top diesel are fine.</seg>
<seg id="26">Those who don't want to invest so much will get the petrol from 20000 Euro, the diesel from 23,000 euros.</seg>
<seg id="27">The engines comply with the Euro 6 emissions standard.</seg>

<seg id="2">It stowed regularly on the bypass road - here a picture of November.</seg>
<seg id="3">But this is to change: the right-to-turn claim shall be extended.</seg>
<seg id="4">This is good news for all the drivers who are standing in traffic on the ambient street every evening in traffic jams if they drive over the motorway to Zubringer (A 43).</seg>
<seg id="5">On the coming Tuesday and Wednesday (16 / 17 August), road construction will be extended by 700 metres between Hammer Straße and the Weser Straße exit.</seg>
<seg id="6">Drivers can then go directly from the hammer street to the right.</seg>
<seg id="7">The big advantage: the traffic is split up early, thus improving the overall production sequence on the busy section of the Bundesstraße 51.</seg>
<seg id="8">The idea with the extended exit had the CDU faction in the District and Representation in Münster-West.</seg>
<seg id="9">The road constriction on the feeder raises the drivers above all between 17 and 19 o'clock.</seg>
<seg id="10">On weekdays, the return trip goes up to the bridge across the Albergher Weg and sometimes beyond.</seg>

<seg id="16">However, it has to be reckoned with years: the bridge has an official remaining period of rest by 2034.</seg>

<seg id="2">In the evening, you roll around forever, at night you lie awake for hours, in the morning it is no longer possible to think of sleep long before the alarm bells.</seg>
<seg id="3">This is anything but relaxing.</seg>
<seg id="4">After all, one is in good society with such problems: according to the Robert Koch Institute, about a quarter of adults have sleep disorders and more than ten percent find their sleep frequently or permanently as not restorative.</seg>
<seg id="5">How do sleep problems or sleep disturbances manifest?</seg>
<seg id="6">There are several forms of sleep disorders, and there can be a variety of causes behind them, emphasises Hans-Günter Weeau, member of the board of the German Society for Schlafforeption and Sleeping Medicine.</seg>
<seg id="7">However, what you understand is the insomnia, that is, a disturbance and perseverance.</seg>
<seg id="8">Many people feel as unsatisfactory or insufficient, says Jens Wagenknecht, member of the board of the German House Medical Association with practice in Varel, Lower Saxony.</seg>
<seg id="9">What is behind sleep disorders?</seg>
<seg id="10">The causes of sleep disorders are complex.</seg>
<seg id="11">Behind it can be organic, mental or behavioural factors, but also medications.</seg>
<seg id="12">Infrequently, sleep disorder is an expression of another disease.</seg>
<seg id="13">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "very early awakening is particularly common in depression," "" "" "" "says Weeau." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="14">And it can be that different factors are dependent upon each other.</seg>
<seg id="15">For example, those who have a slipped disc can be bad, wake up every two or three hours and possibly start to think about everyday problems and worries, there is an example.</seg>
<seg id="16">This leads to tension and sleep is no longer possible.</seg>
<seg id="17">When should sleep disorders become a doctor?</seg>
<seg id="18">Those who do not sleep well over a period of one month in at least three nights a week should go to the doctor, advises wear.</seg>
<seg id="19">The impairment can look quite different: one is beaten, tired, sleepy, has difficulties with attention and concentration, is easily irritable, has mood swings or physical ailments such as stomach or headaches.</seg>
<seg id="20">To alleviate sleep disorders, it is important to find out their causes.</seg>
<seg id="21">Treatment options include behavioural changes, cognitive behavioural therapy, or even medicines - classical sleeping tablets only in exceptional cases and at most for two weeks.</seg>
<seg id="22">In Germany, Dr. Ingo Fietze, head of the interdisciplinary sleep medical centre of the Charité University Medicine Berlin, underlines the low-lying sleeping physician in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="23">For this reason, one should first contact the family doctor in case of sleeping problems, says Weeau.</seg>
<seg id="24">It can clarify with investigations whether the problems have a physical cause.</seg>
<seg id="25">Who should go to sleep laboratory, and what will happen?</seg>
<seg id="26">For the examination in the sleep laboratory, physicians advise, for example, snoring with respirators, in case of sick daily fatigue, in sleeping transducers, or if one does not find the cause of a sleep disorder, Fietze explains.</seg>
<seg id="27">It is not necessary to prepare for the investigation.</seg>
<seg id="28">You should spend the day normal.</seg>
<seg id="29">"please do not make a nap," says Fietze.</seg>
<seg id="30">After the sticking, one goes to bed at its normal time.</seg>
<seg id="31">Besides the electrodes on the body, one carries a nose goggles, a chest strap and an antennae on the finger.</seg>
<seg id="32">In addition, a camera records the sleeping-end at the ceiling.</seg>
<seg id="33">How can those affected get a grip on the problems?</seg>
<seg id="34">There are quite a lot of adjusting screws on which one can apply for a better sleep.</seg>
<seg id="35">Fire counts on: regular sleeping and opening times, not too long in bed, do not sleep on the day, do not watch television to sleep, avoid alcohol and do not watch the clock at night - then you start to reckon immediately, and that's absolutely not conducive to it.</seg>

<seg id="2">Former German swimmer Markus Deibler has commented on Facebook for the disappointing cut of the DSV team at Olympus.</seg>
<seg id="3">In December 2014, he took gold for the first time at the World Championships in Doha and at the same time presented his first world record.</seg>
<seg id="4">Now the former DSV-athlete Markus Deibler has placed himself in front of his ex-team-mates via Facebook.</seg>
<seg id="5">"in a country where an Olympic Champion gets 20,000 €premium and a jungle King 150,000 €no one should wonder about missing medals," wrote the 26-year-old at night on his Facebook page.</seg>
<seg id="6">The transport system in the swimming sport is bad, however, the doping controls are very good.</seg>
<seg id="7">This means that we cannot compete with countries that promote a great deal and do not even look closely at the topic of doping or even operate it.</seg>
<seg id="8">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "I don't say that the controls should be set here," "" "" "" "he explained further." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="9">If he wanted to make a comeback, Deibler had to be reported nine months before his first launch of the National Anti-Doping Agency Germany (NADA).</seg>
<seg id="10">That is exactly how it should be done with countries.</seg>
<seg id="11">"if you cannot control a certain time before WM / OS by independent controllers of WADA / FINA, it is not allowed to take part," says the election Hamburger, who meanwhile operates an ice cream parlor.</seg>

<seg id="2">Professional thieves at Düsseldorf airport</seg>
<seg id="3">On Thursday, the police managed the arrest of two women and two men aged 50 to 61.</seg>
<seg id="4">The suspect committed several handkerchiefs and bags.</seg>
<seg id="5">At 21.30, civil servants in the area of the Düsseldorf airport recognised a gang that was known to the police officers from previous theft cases.</seg>
<seg id="6">The two women and two men had committed several offences since the middle of July, and were involved in a collaborative, social and particularly professional manner.</seg>
<seg id="7">The specialists of the criminal commissary 34 can demonstrate four actions to the dictators who had been specially invited to commit criminal offences to Germany.</seg>
<seg id="8">In doing so they had a total of more than 15,000 Euro.</seg>

<seg id="1">Old buildings, a few lime trees, in between still a remainder of cobblestone pavement: the Riga Street in Berlin-Friedrichshain does not seem like at first sight, but the police count them to the "dangerous places" of the city.</seg>
<seg id="2">Walking along the road from east to west, one passes by playgrounds, a freshly painted kindergarten and a biolades.</seg>
<seg id="3">Someone "ugly!" sprayed on the facade of a grey house.</seg>
<seg id="4">In front of a Lidl, which will soon be demolished, it is already being built: until 2017 there will be a house with high windows and 133 new apartments.</seg>
<seg id="5">Article about this "trendy part," as the responsible real estate company Friedrichshain calls, will be preferred in the last weeks with burning automobiles.</seg>
<seg id="6">The reason is the house with number 94: once it was occupied, the residents now have leases, but on the ground floor there are still rooms occupied and are used for events.</seg>
<seg id="7">Since the beginning of the year, the Berlin indoor senator Henkel has repeatedly called for a hard action of the police against the project, the area referred to as "No-Go-Zone" for police officers and the 94 as the starting point of autonomous violence.</seg>
<seg id="8">After having cleared the rooms on the ground floor, the Kadterschmiede, with 300 police officers, the police patrolled three weeks of official statements with 30 to 40 officials and three team cars on site, locked parts of the road and stopped visitors to enter the house with the number 94.</seg>
<seg id="9">Meanwhile, the renovated building workers commissioned the rooms for the unknown owners of the house.</seg>
<seg id="10">On 13 July, a Berlin administrative court ruled that the clearing had been illegal, and a day later, police and construction workers marched under the jubilation of sympathizers and residents.</seg>
<seg id="11">On this summer afternoon the street acts peacefully: parents walk with children, people sit on the sidewalk in front of the houses in the sun, others talk about vorm late.</seg>
<seg id="12">In the immediate vicinity of the house projects are a primary school and kindergartens.</seg>
<seg id="13">Left violence is not the main concern of many residents: Kerstin Neugebauer, who lives in Kiez since 1999, and Jana *, who has three children here, are mostly stressed by the police presence.</seg>
<seg id="14">With the inhabitants of the house projects they share the concern of rising rents and gentrification.</seg>
<seg id="15">It doesn't sound like a Kiez, who mostly wanted police protection against vandaliating left.</seg>
<seg id="16">The ditch, which the Berlin inner senator and the police between the landlords and their neighbors open up, apparently does not exist.</seg>
<seg id="17">Friedrichshain in the east of Berlin was actually a traditional working-class district, which even today compared to the rest of the city has a low average income and a high risk of poverty.</seg>
<seg id="18">Also house occupations and the resulting housing projects belong to the Kiez for a long time: in 1990, numerous houses were occupied in the former GDR, among them nearly the entire Mainzer Straße very close to the Rigaer.</seg>
<seg id="19">While the Mainzer had been evacuated under a large police force in a regular street fight, many of the projects in the Riga were legalized and are still inhabited by the people who occupied them 26 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="20">At the same time, in recent years, the neighborhood has become increasingly a magnet for tourists and pollinators from all over the world: residents of GDR times and former home users share their Kiez with them.</seg>
<seg id="21">This is also reflected in the rents, which have increased by almost 60 percent since 2009.</seg>
<seg id="22">Many of the new buildings in the Rigaer are being attacked as symbols for this development: they recognize them of pushed panes or freshly painted facades, which were thrown with paint bags.</seg>
<seg id="23">No other road was mentioned this year together with the words "left-autonomous violence."</seg>
<seg id="24">One reason that not all neighbours see this as a problem might be that they are not necessarily affected by crime: crimes like body injury have been directed almost exclusively against policemen.</seg>
<seg id="25">Most of the crimes constitute property damage, which tend to meet the newly built and newly renovated houses.</seg>
<seg id="26">For Kerstin Neugebauer, who lives in a rented house for 17 years alongside the controversial 94, there can be no talk of uncertainty.</seg>
<seg id="27">As for violence, it is important: the people in the 94 are their neighbours who have not been determined.</seg>
<seg id="28">Even the famous burning cars are no longer able to give it directly to the Rigaer.</seg>
<seg id="29">For the educated architect, her street is not a criminal focus, on the contrary: "here one helps each other, lives together on the street and gets more of each other than elsewhere."</seg>
<seg id="30">Neugebauer was consciously drawn into the Riga Street - and remained.</seg>
<seg id="31">That is why it was so important for her to get back to her streets: from the police, politics and the media, which in July all suddenly claimed the sovereignty over the district.</seg>
<seg id="32">But in the eyes of inhabitants such as Neugebauer, the street will still be taken away from them: through faceless newbuilds in former construction gaps, which displace the old inhabitants.</seg>
<seg id="33">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "these are condominiums that are not interesting for many here - more people who are not so well contaminated," "" "" "" "she says." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="34">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "I cannot be absolutely endorsing" "" "" "" "violence and destruction." "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="35">But what do you want to do if you never listen to someone?</seg>
<seg id="36">There is frustration on all sides, even with the police and the inhabitants.</seg>
<seg id="37">For starters who are angry about color bombs Kerstin has a little understanding: the house projects and the left scene belonged to the Kiez.</seg>
<seg id="38">Those who prefer should be aware of it - just like someone who moves into a pub area that can complain bad about noise.</seg>
<seg id="39">All persons presented only with first names have asked to not be named with their proper name</seg>

<seg id="2">Annika Deuschle is the contact person for integration and organizer.</seg>
<seg id="3">She is also a social worker on site.</seg>
<seg id="4">Annika Deuschle has been the refugee commissioner for Urbach since July.</seg>
<seg id="5">The Social Pedagogue supports the team of Administration for Achim Grockenberger.</seg>
<seg id="6">She sees herself as contact partner for all actors: refugees, working group, refugee assistance, administration, authorities and those who else join in.</seg>
<seg id="7">Regine client of the working group suggests that the volunteers are more than thankful that Deuschle is now there, who has a problem especially.</seg>
<seg id="8">Some - less mockingly but rather targeted on the multitude of desired task areas - meant that the administration wanted to write the job.</seg>
<seg id="9">We were looking for an administrative specialist with a talent for languages and people, combined with a long-standing experience in the field of social work, just a wooping milkmilksau.</seg>
<seg id="10">But administrative work is not its central area, Annika Deuschle says.</seg>
<seg id="11">Above all, it is about organization, work with local people and behind the scenes as well as network activity.</seg>
<seg id="12">The 31-year-old has been there for about six weeks.</seg>
<seg id="13">It has a 50 percent position limited to three years.</seg>
<seg id="14">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "it was high time," "" "" "" "says Regine Client that Annika Deuschle supports honest and full-time actors." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="15">There are big and small problems, organizational, human and communication problems.</seg>
<seg id="16">New containers soon arrive at the Wasenstraße</seg>
<seg id="17">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "it has been a serious problem for some time to find housing for the connecting refugees who have been recognized." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="18">The municipalities are responsible for the provision of the connection.</seg>
<seg id="19">They must accommodate the refugees in their own or rented living rooms.</seg>
<seg id="20">The municipalities themselves must bear the costs for the construction, the rent or the renovation of these accommodations.</seg>
<seg id="21">The responsibility changes from the office of councils to the Commune and Jobcenter.</seg>
<seg id="22">Problem: there are free objects, but not every landlord wants to offer his apartment.</seg>
<seg id="23">The search has been very difficult for some time now.</seg>
<seg id="24">De facto, the administration does not find private apartments.</seg>
<seg id="25">So far, it does not work, so be reliant on private dwellings, such as Deuschle.</seg>
<seg id="26">Therefore, communal dwellings must be consolidated as it is so beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="27">So soon new containers are placed in the car wash road.</seg>
<seg id="28">But only with apartments it is not done.</seg>
<seg id="29">Perspective is the keyword, Regine client and Annika Deuschle agree.</seg>
<seg id="30">In addition to a permanent residence, there are internships, apprenticeships, school grounds, one-euro jobs and helpers for refugees and migrants who need to be devoured or established.</seg>
<seg id="31">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "more places would be good," "" "" "" "says Regine Client." "" ""</seg>
<seg id="32">Many work in the building yard or help homeworkers, do nonprofit work - and that is motivated and very neat, as Annika Deuschle reports.</seg>
<seg id="33">She hopes that the work for the community will lead to a positive external action.</seg>
<seg id="34">That is "no occupational therapy."</seg>
<seg id="35">But activity does not just mean work.</seg>
<seg id="36">The day needs a firm structure, say Deuschle and customer.</seg>
<seg id="37">People would have to develop a sense of belonging.</seg>
<seg id="38">So I need offers like sports, contacts with locals and especially language courses.</seg>
<seg id="39">Professional courses are rare.</seg>
<seg id="40">So also jump here administration and volunteers here.</seg>
<seg id="41">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "it is central that the refugees feel they are welcome and welcome in Germany." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="42">The long duration of the procedure is a problem.</seg>
<seg id="43">They have to explain to the refugees that it takes time and they can make use of time wisely, for example with language courses.</seg>
<seg id="44">Whoever develops the feeling that he can't help anyone in Urbach, may not work and be useless, he will never integrate.</seg>
<seg id="45">The clear majority is motivated.</seg>
<seg id="46">But there are problems, "says customer honestly," people with nothing at all. "the work of Deuschle and customer is therefore always to motivate others.</seg>
<seg id="47">"" "" "" "all this is already a" "" "" "" "mammoth task." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="48">A difficult question: do the two have fear of radicalisation, even in a small church like Urbach?</seg>
<seg id="49">"no," Regine client clearly states "what some naive likes." a residual risk could and would not exclude them.</seg>
<seg id="50">However, the helpers are already sensitized.</seg>
<seg id="51">These incidents are also subject to the refugees.</seg>
<seg id="52">They would be afraid that the killers would put them in jail.</seg>
<seg id="53">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "they want to show that they have nothing to do with it," "" "" "" "says Regine Client." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="54">Many would like to stay in Urbach.</seg>
<seg id="55">So the local and honorary officials have to look out for activities locally and in the region.</seg>
<seg id="56">They always have in the background that soon a new impetus for refugees and migrants could come to Urbach.</seg>
<seg id="57">Does Germany need a cap?</seg>
<seg id="58">The question is clear to answer this question.</seg>
<seg id="59">Actually it is unfair to put them on site helpers.</seg>
<seg id="60">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "in Urbach, we haven't arrived where we want to go," "" "" "" "says Annika Deuschle." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="61">No new refugees, that would relax the situation.</seg>
<seg id="62">Regine client also makes it clear that the Urbacher is already busy to integrate the existing people in a reasonable manner.</seg>
<seg id="63">These are currently around 100 people, mainly young men.</seg>
