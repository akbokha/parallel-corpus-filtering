Obama Rec@@ ei@@ ves Net@@ any@@ ahu
the relationship between Obama and Net@@ any@@ ahu isn &apos;t just friendly .
the two wanted to talk about the implementation of the international agreement as well as about Te@@ hr@@ an &apos;s dest@@ abili@@ zing measures in the Middle East .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the meeting , however , it should also deal with the conflict with the Palestinians and the two @-@ state solution . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the relationship between Obama and Net@@ any@@ ahu has been ten@@ se for years .
Washington critic@@ ises the ongoing settlement construction of Israel and th@@ rows Net@@ any@@ ahu &apos;s lack of will in the peace process .
the deal struck by Obama about Iran &apos;s nuclear program has deterior@@ ated further .
in March , Net@@ any@@ ahu hosted a controversial speech at the invitation of the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans , partly considered as an aff@@ ront to Obama .
the speech was not denied with Obama , but a meeting was rejected with reference to the election of the election in Israel at that time .
in an emergency call Professor hopes to have shot his girlfriend
in an emergency call Professor Sh@@ ann@@ on Lamb told the police that he shot his girlfriend and that the officials had to come to his house .
lamb was important to stress that his &quot; sweet dog &quot; was alive and probably upset , and he said that the family contacts of the dead woman could be found on the mobile phone .
within the house , officials found the bodies of A@@ my Pr@@ enti@@ ss and a hand@@ written note that was scri@@ bed on a white block : &quot; I &apos;m so sorry I wanted to und@@ o it , I loved A@@ my and she is the only woman who ever loved me . &quot; this was signed by the authorities in the letter , and he was signed by Lamb .
there was no indication that Lamb , who taught in two online courses for Delta State University in Cle@@ vel@@ and , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , had already travelled 300 miles to the school grounds where he shot and killed a popular history professor , E@@ than Schmidt , at the door to his office .
Delta State University police chief Lyn@@ n Bu@@ ford said university staff have heard shooting at 10 : 18 o &apos;clock .
he said that Lamb had made the disa@@ strous cry at some point later .
until the end of the day there was another death : he took the life when the police en@@ cir@@ cl@@ ed him .
one day after the shooting in the university , the students and teachers forced to hide behind closed doors , the authorities are still trying to get a picture of what Lamb motivated .
the details published by the investig@@ ators at both ends of the state , as well as what students and staff who knew him , helped to draw a picture of a talented but possibly difficult teacher .
students said they were looking forward to his lessons .
the police in Gau@@ tier , where Pr@@ enti@@ ss died , said that he has no history of violence or criminal history .
Schmidt himself had mentioned Lamb in a book written by him , in which he mentioned the &quot; wonderful people , &quot; with whom he shared his academic life .
both of them were taught in the social sciences and history department , the faculty of which comprises 17 members , and many students attended courses of both .
at the same time , there were some incl@@ ines to problematic behavi@@ ours .
a student , Brand@@ on Be@@ a@@ vers , who praised Lamb , said that he was also a little nervous and nervous , &quot; as if something was wrong with him . &quot;
another student , Mik@@ el Sy@@ kes , said that he told him that he had to deal with stress at the end of the academic year 2014 @-@ 15 .
lamb had previously asked the Delta State University for health reasons and said that he had any health problem .
this year he taught only two online courses .
recent changes in the university &apos;s employment policy meant that the doctorate , for which Lamb had worked so hard , would not be a guarantee for an automatic path to an appointment as Assistant Professor .
University President William La@@ for@@ ge said he didn &apos;t know anything about a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt , but &quot; of course there was something in Mr Lam@@ b &apos;s imagination . &quot;
these are questions that Lamb can no longer answer .
after fle@@ eing from the campus , the police later found Lam@@ bs@@ k &apos;s trail when he sailed back to Miss@@ issi@@ ppi from Ar@@ kan@@ s@@ as .
before he could be arrested , Lamb killed himself with a .@@ 38 cali@@ bre gun in the back@@ yard of a house about a mile south of his parents &apos; house on the outskirts of Green@@ ville , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , said Washington County Cor@@ oner Meth@@ el Johnson .
his car was still in the dri@@ ve@@ way .
it wasn &apos;t immediately clear why Lamb went to this house , but Johnson said that she believed that he knew the people who lived there .
lamb grew up in the region .
lamb starting in 2009 began his work at the university , which has 3,@@ 500 students in a city with about 12@@ ,000 inhabitants and taught ge@@ ography and pedago@@ gy .
he completed his PhD in Ped@@ ago@@ gy in spring .
one of the long @-@ standing friends Lam@@ bs@@ led him as intelligent , charis@@ matic and funny .
Car@@ la H@@ air@@ tone said she was 15 and lamb was 20 when they met through common friends .
she and her friends were in High School , and he was the cool older guy who tried several years to teach her the guitar playing .
at that time he was the s@@ warm of women .
all girls melt away when he was there , &quot; H@@ air@@ tone said , now 40 and in Jackson &apos;s subur@@ b of Brand@@ on .
Lamb and Pr@@ enti@@ ss were obviously together for some time .
in the emergency call , &quot; Lamb &quot; said &quot; I killed my wife , &quot; but there was no certificate from a marriage .
they had a dog named Light@@ ning who lived with them in the brick house adjoining a ba@@ you in Gau@@ tier .
the police said that the dog was ok .
the ex @-@ husband of Pr@@ enti@@ ss , Sha@@ wn O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said they were divor@@ ced 15 years ago , but friends stayed and had a daughter who was 19 years old .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she was totally destroyed on the ground , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en over his daughter . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
she and her mother were absolutely best friends .
O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said he never met Lamb , but with his daughter Ab@@ ig@@ ail , he heard that Lamb was interested in music and played the blues .
lamb met Pr@@ enti@@ ss when he and Ab@@ ig@@ ail met both in a summer fair three years ago .
later they played together one or the other gig .
O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said his daughter writes and sings its own music .
Pr@@ enti@@ ss was a nurse who worked online for various companies .
Mike Sha@@ ffer , a bark@@ e@@ eper and sometimes entertainment coordinator at The Ju@@ le@@ p Room , a dim@@ ly lit bar near Gau@@ tier , said that he &apos;s Lamb and Pr@@ enti@@ ss Night at night 5 September for the last time after Lamb had ended his guitar and harmon@@ ic@@ ity game before a spar@@ se audience ended .
there was no sign that something was wrong .
&quot; just a happy couple , &quot; he said .
we were at the clearing and jo@@ yed together .
I mean they both had a good sense of j@@ okes .
Schmidt , the dead professor , led the first semester seminar program and specialized in American natives and colonial history , said Don Allan Mit@@ ch@@ ell , an English professor at school .
he was married and had three small children .
he studied at the Empor@@ ia State University in K@@ ans@@ as and was President of his bro@@ therhood and student committee .
around 900 people participated in the Delta State Campus in Cle@@ vel@@ and on Tuesday evening , including teachers , staff , students and members of the community at a candle light memorial service .
Schmidt &apos;s wife Li@@ z and his brother Jeff Schmidt also participated in the vi@@ gi@@ l , while the university choir &quot; B@@ right Mor@@ ning Star &quot; and &quot; Ama@@ zing Grace &quot; sang .
the lessons will be resum@@ ed on Wednesday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we try to move our students back , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said La@@ For@@ ge . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the crisis is over .
this is a day of healing .
A@@ my and Ro@@ geli@@ o Soli@@ s reported from Cle@@ vel@@ and , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi .
associated Press writers E@@ mil@@ y Wag@@ sters P@@ ett@@ us in Green@@ ville , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , and Rebecca Sant@@ ana in New Orleans contributed to this report .
this story has been corrected to reflect that the police now says that Lamb opened the emergency room after he shot Schmidt and that he described Pr@@ enti@@ a as his wife in his emergency call , but there is no indication that the two have ever married .
Toys R Us plan to hire less labor force for Christmas time
Toys R Us says that it won &apos;t be as many Christmas season employees as last year , but the toy and baby products dealer states that he will give the employees and seasonal workers a chance to work more hours .
the company said it plans to stop 40,000 people in stores and distribution centers throughout the country . in the Christmas season of 2014 , 45@@ ,000 workers were hired .
most jobs will be part @-@ time jobs .
the company said it will start with application talks this month and the number of employees increases from October to December .
while the holidays are still months away , the Christmas business is getting closer , and companies are preparing to hire temporary workers to supply shops with employees who sell , send and deliver products .
Michael J. Fox j@@ okes about his &quot; Date &quot; with Princess Diana
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the premiere of &quot; Back to the Future &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was a great moment for Michael J. Fox . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was also remarkable for personal reasons .
&quot; we sat in the theater waiting for the roy@@ als , and I realize that the seat next to me is empty , and it gradually becomes clear to me that Princess Diana will sit next to me , &quot; he said in a trailer for an upcoming documentary &quot; Back in Time . &quot;
the film begins , and it makes sense to me that I am a simulated wire and an arm length from being with the Princess of Wales on a date .
&quot; back in Time , &quot; a documentary on &quot; Back to the Future , &quot; presents interviews with Fox , Le@@ a Thom@@ p@@ son and Christopher Lloyd , and with director Robert Z@@ em@@ eck@@ is and producer Steven Spiel@@ berg .
&quot; back for the Future &quot; had its premiere 30 years ago .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it really is for me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Spiel@@ berg , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the biggest time travel film ever filmed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; back in Time &quot; will be on VO@@ D , DVD and selected cinem@@ as in October .
UN chief says there is no military solution in Syria
Secretary General B@@ an K@@ i @-@ moon says his response to Russia &apos;s reinforced military support for Syria is : &quot; there is no military solution &quot; of the conflict lasting almost five years , and more weapons will wor@@ sen violence and misery for millions of people .
the UN chief reiter@@ ates all parties , including the shared UN Security Council , to unite and support inclusive negotiations for finding a political solution .
B@@ an said a press conference held Wednesday that he plans to meet the Foreign Ministers of the five permanent member nations of the Council - USA , Russia , China , United Kingdom and France - on the fr@@ inge of the Annual General Meeting during this month to discuss the situation in Syria .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he depl@@ ored that the spl@@ its in the Council and within the Syrian people and the regional powers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; make this situation un@@ sol@@ vable . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; B@@ an called on the five permanent members to show the same solidarity and unity that they have proven in achieving a nuclear deal with Iran . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
8 Re@@ as@@ onal values that show that Donald Tr@@ ump is serious .
some have tried to brand him as a flop .
others have dismissed him as a joke .
and some wait for a collapse .
but no matter how some Rep@@ ublic@@ ans try to pull Donald Tr@@ ump from the top ranks in poll@@ s down , it has ( yet ) not work .
ten of the last eleven national surveys revealed Donald Tr@@ ump in the double @-@ digit range , and some begin to seriously wonder what it means to the odds of nomin@@ ating the real estate mo@@ gul@@ s .
of course , it is still too early in the election period .
no one claims that Tr@@ ump is likely to win the Republi@@ can nom@@ ination .
experts stress that at this time , in 2011 , Rick Per@@ r@@ ys leadership was handed over to the rising Her@@ man Cain , of which no one even won a state in the nom@@ ination process .
and there are many reasons why he would have to fight in a general election .
but out@@ sider groups such as J@@ eb Bus@@ h@@ s Super PA@@ C and the conservative business group Club for Growth now recognise dr@@ um@@ ps staying power and start letting their dollar flow to t@@ opp@@ le him .
here are some current survey values that suggest that real estate mo@@ gu@@ l is not just a temporary phase :
Tr@@ um@@ ps popularity values have turned 180 degrees .
shortly before Donald Tr@@ ump announced his can@@ did@@ acy mid @-@ June , a pol@@ l conducted by Mon@@ mouth University showed that only two out of ten Rep@@ ublic@@ ans saw the real estate mo@@ gu@@ l positive .
by mid @-@ July it was 40 percent .
at the beginning of August there were 52 percent .
now six out of 10 Rep@@ ublic@@ ans have a positive opinion of Donald Tr@@ ump .
about three out of ten say they have a negative opinion .
and these figures stand in early states .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a Qu@@ in@@ ni@@ pi@@ ac vote in I@@ owa reported last week that 60 percent of Rep@@ ublic@@ ans have a good opinion of Tr@@ ump . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
two @-@ thirds of the GO@@ P voters GO@@ P would be happy with Tr@@ ump as candidates .
in a pol@@ l of CN@@ N / OR@@ C last week 67 percent of the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans said they were either &quot; excited &quot; or &quot; satisfied &quot; if Tr@@ ump was nominated .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; only two of them say they would &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; anno@@ yed &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if he were the candidate . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
only Ben Car@@ son creates about the same enthusiasm as Tr@@ ump ( 43 percent say they were &quot; enthusiastic &quot; vs. 40 percent who say the same about tr@@ ump ) .
the next one in terms of enthusiasm ?
Marco Ru@@ bio with only 21 percent .
on the other hand 47 percent of Republi@@ can voters say that they were &quot; dis@@ satisfied &quot; or &quot; angry &quot; if J@@ eb Bush , the favourite of the Est@@ abl@@ ishment , would be the candidate .
a majority of Rep@@ ublic@@ ans do not see Tr@@ um@@ ps tem@@ per as a problem .
while Donald Tr@@ ump is widely critici@@ zed for his bom@@ b@@ astic and insul@@ ting statements , 52 percent of Irish voters ten@@ ding to the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans believe that the real estate mo@@ gu@@ l has the right tem@@ per for a president so ABC News / Washington Post on Monday .
the same number is valid in the first country of the nation , the state of I@@ owa , where the same 52 percent of Rep@@ ublic@@ ans think that he has the personality for a commander @-@ in @-@ chief , according to Qu@@ in@@ ni@@ pi@@ ac last week .
nevertheless , 44 percent think that he did not have the personality to effectively execute his office , and almost six out of 10 Independent states say that his temper@@ ament does not fit into the White House , so ABC / Post .
Republi@@ can voters get used to the idea .
when they set up their schol@@ ar hats , Republi@@ can voters hold Tr@@ ump for real .
when asked who will most likely win the GO@@ P nom@@ ination , say after a survey of CN@@ N / OR@@ C out of last week four out of ten that Tr@@ ump is the best bet .
this is a change from the time when four out of ten at the end of July put their money to J@@ eb Bush .
complete disclosure : in the past , GO@@ P voters did not have the clear@@ est crystal ball .
at this time in the final cycle , four out of ten rep@@ ublic@@ ans thought that Rick Per@@ ry would win the nom@@ ination to only 28 % for the final Candi@@ date Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney .
nevertheless , it is evident that a large number of GO@@ P voters look at Tr@@ um@@ ps campaign as plau@@ sible .
even when the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans gathered for another candidate , Tr@@ ump is beating almost everyone .
some experts point out that the fragmented field probably contributes to dr@@ um@@ ps leadership while anti @-@ pump support is distributed to more than a dozen other candidates .
but a survey by Mon@@ mouth University in early September shows that in a hypo@@ the@@ tical head @-@ to @-@ head race between Tr@@ ump and most other Republi@@ can candidates , Tr@@ ump has re@@ aped the majority support .
he has 13 points ahead of Marco Ru@@ bio 14 points , before Walker 15 points , before J@@ eb Bush 19 points and finally before Rand Paul , John Ka@@ sich and Chris Christi@@ e 33 points .
it &apos;s a head @-@ to @-@ head race with T@@ ed Cruz .
the only candidate that hits him ?
Ben Car@@ son would over@@ take the entrepren@@ eur with 19 points in a hypo@@ the@@ tical head @-@ to @-@ head race .
a scar@@ ce majority of Donald Tr@@ ump fans says they have formed their minds .
a new survey by C@@ BS / NY@@ T on Tuesday shows that only slightly more than half of voters who support Tr@@ ump tell that they have firmly forgiven their votes .
of course a lot can happen to change that , and no one can really say never change the mind .
46 percent said they leave the door open to switch to other candidates .
yet Tr@@ um@@ ps is strongest competi@@ tor at the moment of other out@@ si@@ ders , the neuro@@ surgeon Ben Car@@ son , but voters who say they have formed their minds are twice as common for Tr@@ ump .
six out of 10 Rep@@ ublic@@ ans say that they coinci@@ de with tr@@ ump on immigration .
since Donald Tr@@ ump has been calling immigrants from Mexico &quot; rap@@ ists &quot; two months ago , the immigration hub in the public discourse was in 2016 .
some are concerned that the bom@@ b@@ astic expression of Tr@@ ump decisive His@@ pan@@ o Americans will be kept away from the Republi@@ can party and will damage the re@@ orientation efforts .
but after the new ABC / Post @-@ survey of Monday , six out of 10 Rep@@ ublic@@ ans say that they agree with tr@@ ump in questions of immigration .
so long as immigration remains in the li@@ mel@@ i@@ ght , Donald Tr@@ ump will apparently also do .
the fru@@ stration of the government climbs to new high@@ s .
meanwhile , Donald Tr@@ ump and Ben Car@@ son account for about half of the support of Republi@@ can voters , mainly due to their out@@ si@@ ders status .
six out of 10 Rep@@ ublic@@ ans say in the new Mon@@ days survey by ABC / Post , they rather want a political out@@ sider than anyone with government experience .
and they are fur@@ ious against Washington .
a survey by Des Mo@@ ines Register / Blo@@ om@@ berg in I@@ owa two weeks ago shows that three of four I@@ owa rep@@ ublic@@ ans are frustr@@ ated by the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans in Congress , with 54 per cent &quot; dis@@ satisfied &quot; and 21 percent &quot; in@@ discrimin@@ ate . &quot;
Munich , Sy@@ lt and Co . : Germany &apos;s five most exclusive residential districts
the most expensive residential complex is located here in Sch@@ ook@@ en@@ weg - with a view over the North Sea Pr@@ att .
in the street , one square meter of a th@@ atch roof costs EUR 7@@ 3.@@ 300 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Sy@@ lt , the range of objects is naturally limited , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is said in the study - therefore the high price . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a new study shows which special locations cost one square metre the most .
of course , 18,@@ 70 euros per square meter for a student bu@@ de in Munich are not really little .
in contrast to Germany &apos;s top residential locations , however , one of the price is like pe@@ an@@ uts .
the Real Estate service provider Engel &amp; Völ@@ kers has published a ranking of the most exclusive German residential sites - with square met@@ rics in di@@ zz@@ ying heights .
there are several tens of thousands of euros ni@@ x - per square meter , well @-@ noticed .
but it &apos;s good who can afford it ...
by the way : Munich is here exceptionally not at the top .
champi@@ ons League : Bavaria @-@ dream start thanks to Müller and Götz@@ e
double scor@@ er in Pi@@ ra@@ eus : Bayern @-@ Star Thomas Müller has just one run .
a happy hit by Thomas Müller smoo@@ thed the way to FC Bayern 3 : 0 at Olympi@@ ac@@ os Pi@@ ra@@ eus - then it ran .
a sovereign pr@@ el@@ ude to the Champions League season .
world champi@@ ons Thomas Müller and Mario Götz@@ e gave FC Bayern a dream start to FC Bayern in the Milan mission .
the team of Trainer P@@ ep Guardi@@ ola won their kick @-@ off game in the Champions League at the Greek Record Champion Olympi@@ ak@@ os in a hot atmosphere thanks to Müll@@ ers double pack ( 5@@ 2nd / 90@@ th + 2 ) and Götz@@ e Hit ( 8@@ 9th ) with 3 : 0 ( 0 : 0 ) .
the twel@@ fth starting success in series is supposed to be the first step towards the final on May 28 , 2016 in Italy , where Guardi@@ ola finally wants to bring the H@@ enk@@ el@@ pot@@ t to Munich in the third attempt .
Müller received good assistance from Olympi@@ ak@@ os Tor@@ wart Roberto , who had a f@@ lange @-@ covered shot of the world champion at his 28 hits in the Champions League for Bavaria leadership .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we won &apos;t under@@ estimate them , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bayern @-@ captain Philipp L@@ earned promised hot @-@ bloo@@ ded fans before the game in the Kar@@ ais@@ k@@ ak@@ is Stadium - and the Munich @-@ based speech . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they showed a concentrated and dedicated imagination without gl@@ aring .
Pi@@ ra@@ eus had won his youngest six home games in the royal class , among them against well @-@ known clubs such as Manchester United , At@@ l@@ é@@ ti@@ co Madrid or Ju@@ vent@@ us Turin .
in 2011 Bor@@ ussi@@ a Dortmund ( 1 : 3 ) stum@@ bled here .
but the Bav@@ arians , un@@ defeated in seven European ac@@ up du@@ els with Greek teams , did not want to be the next victim .
they ran cour@@ age@@ ously , but with their offen@@ sives , however , they were often too inf@@ le@@ xi@@ ble to work .
the attacks were often launched on the left side of Douglas Costa , which was rarely passed against the former Braunschwei@@ ger O@@ mar El@@ ab@@ d@@ ell@@ a@@ ou@@ i .
Müller had more luck on the right when his flan@@ k hit the right half field in the left upper corner .
in the 6@@ 7th minute the World Champion gave the possible 2 : 0 .
Robert Lew@@ and@@ owski had the best opportunities in the first half .
first , when Olympi@@ ak@@ os @-@ storms ide@@ ye Brown struck the pol@@ o of the Pol@@ es from the line ( 26 ) .
then by direct pick @-@ up , you saved Tor@@ wart Roberto with his knee ( 35 . ) .
although the Bav@@ arians moved into their usual dominant game , Pi@@ ra@@ eus could set sof@@ tw@@ ood .
on keeper Manuel Neu@@ er , however , was reli@@ ant .
for example , when he pul@@ ls a shot of Ide@@ a over the l@@ atin ( 5@@ 6th ) .
before Neu@@ er he left Guardi@@ ola to defend a four @-@ chain with David Al@@ aba in the centre next to Jer@@ ome Bo@@ at@@ eng who did it well .
Mario Götz@@ e , after muscular problems back in the cad@@ re , sat outside .
the World Cup man did not give the green light until after the final qualifying session , &quot; said sports director Matthias Sam@@ pler at &quot; Sky &quot; : &quot; if you want to make something different from that , this is vi@@ cious . &quot;
also during the first change , Guardi@@ ola decided against him when he brought K@@ ings@@ ley Com@@ an for the killed Lew@@ and@@ owski ( 59@@ . ) .
Götz@@ e arrived late for Ar@@ tur@@ o Vi@@ dal ( 7@@ 6. ) and later made it clear 13 minutes later , by El@@ f@@ meter Müller put another on it .
in front of the game there was a break in the stadium .
after a smaller group of partly ver@@ m@@ um@@ med Bayern fans in their audience block apparently provoked the supporters of the host Pi@@ ra@@ eus with words and gestures , the security forces attacked and went with striking flash@@ es against the Munich followers .
at least one Bayern @-@ fan was injured from the stadium .
who smo@@ kes , has a higher risk of losing teeth
those who smoke , not only harm the lungs , but also the teeth - this suggests a Potsdam long @-@ term study .
the good news : in case of ren@@ unciation , the risk is reduced quickly .
smokers have a much higher risk of losing their teeth early .
this results from the long @-@ term study of an international research team , including several members of the German Institute for Food Research ( DI@@ f@@ E ) in Potsdam .
compared to non @-@ smokers , smokers lay the risk of losing their teeth pre@@ mat@@ urely in order to increase the 2.@@ 5@@ - to 3.6 @-@ fold .
the scientists observed more than 23,@@ 300 participants .
the main causes of tooth loss are tooth decay and inflammation of the gum , emphas@@ ises the DI@@ f@@ E .
for this perio@@ don@@ ti@@ tis , smoking is a risk factor , the authors emphasize .
the relationship between smoking and loss of teeth therefore goes back to more frequent fl@@ esh@@ ly inflamm@@ ations in smokers .
it is not clear to what extent smoking increases the risk of c@@ aries .
people who stopped smoking could reduce their risk within a short time , write the researchers at the &quot; Journal of Dental Research . &quot;
however , it could take more than ten years until the endanger@@ ment sin@@ ks again to the level of non @-@ smokers , explained Er@@ du@@ tor Thomas Dietrich of the English University of Birmingham .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one must convince people to become non @-@ smokers , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; President H@@ einer Boeing from DI@@ f@@ E said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; smoking shor@@ tens life time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
smoking is good for the lungs and vessels and , according to our findings , also leads to good dental health up to high age .
in Germany , more than 20 per cent of the population aged 65 to 74 years of unemployment was affected by the DI@@ f@@ E .
previous studies have already pointed out that smoking increases the risk of early tooth loss .
the new long @-@ term study under@@ scores the findings .
arch@@ e@@ ologists meet the remains of the late Anti@@ quity at Cologne &apos;s Rhein@@ u@@ fer
archaeological findings have been made on the right bank of the Rhine in Cologne for the repeated time .
in the vicinity of the construction site for the new Rhine bou@@ levard , archae@@ ologists from the Roman @-@ German@@ ic Museum have dug skel@@ et@@ ons and rem@@ nants of historical buildings , said museum director Marcus Trier on Tuesday .
since the beginning of the construction work on the Rhine , histori@@ ans are searching for so @-@ called soil monuments .
in all construction projects in the city district of Cologne , the museum is always referred to as a specialist office for archaeological soil preservation .
in the third phase of the Rhine bou@@ levard , archae@@ ologists now found their place .
from text documents it has already been known that in the fourth century a fortress and in the 8th century had stood a church , Trier was explaining .
beside the remains of the fortress and the church tower there was also a cemetery with around 350 graves , which belonged to the church .
young woman from freight train recorded
after a young woman is un@@ happy at the railway station in the Mis@@ er@@ ir@@ chen @-@ Lin@@ ders station , the Federal Police asks the population for help .
on Wednesday morning , around 1.@@ 40 a.m. , the woman crossed the railway towards the railway station building at the end of the platform and was captured by a freight train coming from Mön@@ chen@@ glad@@ bach .
according to the Federal Police , it has borne severe injuries from the capture of the train .
she was treated with emergency medical care and brought to a hospital by rescue forces .
because of the noc@@ tur@@ nal equ@@ est@@ rian crossing of the young woman there are no findings to the medi@@ ating officials .

EU Commission proposes new court in dispute over TT@@ IP
in order to intensi@@ fy the dispute over the planned Trans@@ atlan@@ tic Free Trade Agreement ( TT@@ IP ) , the European Commission has proposed a comprehensive reform of the current arbit@@ ration system .
the controversial private mediation mechanisms for disputes between companies and states should therefore be replaced by a more transparent system , which in its operation corresponds to much more traditional courts .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to set up a system to trust the citizens , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said European Commissioner Ceci@@ lia Malm@@ ström on the performance . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Swe@@ de proposed introducing the proposal as a European negotiating position to the free trade talks with the US .
the German government announced its support .
TT@@ IP aims to create the world &apos;s largest free trade zone with 800 million people .
the plans for the reform of the current arbit@@ ration proceedings fores@@ ee that the EU states and the US jointly select independent judges for a new investment court .
they are to come from the EU , the US and third countries .
a second instance is scheduled for the first time .
it would allow it to appeal against jud@@ gements .
until now , the parties involved agreed with each other on refer@@ ees , there was no obj@@ ections to their judgments .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the discussion of recent months it has become clear that citizens do not trust the old IS@@ DS system in fair@@ ness and justice , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; commented Mal@@ ström . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the long term , it wants to work towards an international investment court according to its own specifications .
there could then be clari@@ fied , for example , disputes between Chinese companies and EU states .
the investor @-@ state arbit@@ ration proceedings ( IS@@ DS ) , especially requested by major corporations , are considered one of the main reasons for the great resistance in Europe against TT@@ IP .
the traditional arbit@@ ration tri@@ bun@@ als are critic@@ ised by opponents as a kind of parallel justice which companies can fight damages on tax@@ pay@@ ers , le@@ ver@@ aging national laws , or cutting down consumer and environmental standards .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the first comments anti @-@ TT@@ IP organizations such as Camp@@ act referred to the European Commission &apos;s proposals as inadequate . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it has been critic@@ ised in particular that they should not apply to the already negotiated free trade agreement with Canada ( C@@ eta ) .
on the other hand , the German Secretary of Economy , Matthias Mach@@ nig ( SPD ) , described the plans as a major advance .
the Commission considered essential points in the reform that the Minister of Economic Affairs , Sig@@ mar Gabriel , worked with other EU trade ministers in the spring .
the old system of private arbit@@ ration is from the table .
also the French government welcomed the plans of Malm@@ ström .
the European corporate association B@@ US@@ IN@@ ES@@ S@@ EURO@@ PE warned against restric@@ ting the economic potential of the economy by too many new rules .
in this way , particularly small and medium @-@ sized enterprises could be dis@@ advant@@ aged .
when the talks on the TT@@ IP free trade agreement ( Trans@@ atlan@@ tic Trade and Investment Partnership ) can be concluded , further unclear on Wednesday .
the negotiations have been underway since mid @-@ 2013 .
however , the topic of investor protection has not yet been discussed with the US .
originally a framework for the agreement should already stand at the end of this year .
this date is considered to be no longer durable .
delicate Folk of Su@@ f@@ jan St@@ ev@@ ens in Hamburg
eleven years ago Su@@ f@@ jan St@@ ev@@ ens sits on stage at the Cologne Prime Club ( now : Lux@@ or ) .
next to him is a fli@@ p@@ chart on which the in@@ timi@@ dating folk singer has recorded the picturesque U.S. state Mich@@ ig@@ an with felt pen .
the whole audience , about 40 people , is almost gri@@ pped by St@@ ev@@ ens &apos;s lecture .
he tells us about different places he always records on the map of his meti@@ culous and delic@@ ately arranged songs .
where they came from and how it looks there , in his homeland .
since then St@@ ev@@ ens has been proving to be a wonderful creative mas@@ on .
with the 2003 published and third album &quot; Gre@@ etings from Mich@@ ig@@ an : the Great Lake State , &quot; clever@@ ly composed songs that blend harmon@@ i@@ ously close to American folk of the late six@@ ties , but can always drift opul@@ ent opul@@ ent at any time .
it is rum@@ oured that &quot; Mich@@ ig@@ an &quot; would be the first part of a forbidden series : each of the 50 states should be sung in a row .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but already in 2004 and near the border of the Rhine , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Seven Sw@@ ans &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has already appeared and has positive expectations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

a year later the musician living in New York returns to the series .

the album entered the American Bill@@ board charts and is missing in any annual list of influential music media .
after extremely productive experiments St@@ ev@@ ens will then rely on &quot; The Age of Ad@@ z &quot; ( 2010 ) very extensively .
this sixth regular studio album is still broad@@ ly orchest@@ rated , but carried by programmed sequences or beats and plays with all kinds of effect and rever@@ b .
far from the smaller clubs , the stage shows here become a colorful spectacle of ne@@ on head@@ bands and large lumin@@ escent stage de@@ co .

although nearly 2000 guests sit in their chairs , the significantly more mature St@@ ev@@ ens returns to in@@ timacy and folk .
without judging the audience , the group of excellent musicians is playing through the broad@@ ly enriched album .
you hear from the audience : the lecture is &quot; opul@@ ent &quot; and you can therefore throw away the &quot; record in essence . &quot;

Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s debut at the Prime Minister &apos;s Fra@@ gran@@ o
since his election Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s debut at the Prime Minister &apos;s Fra@@ gran@@ ces is anticipated with suspen@@ se
the new Labour leader Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ n will make his debut at the prime minister &apos;s Fra@@ gran@@ o and set up for the first time with David Cameron .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n will rise to face the first of his six issues shortly after noon , with his performance being tested by the media and the near@@ ness of the Labour MPs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he called for &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; less theatre and more facts &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at this weekly event . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he also said that he could skip some sessions to leave them to colleagues .
the meeting will be the first parliamentary review of Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s leadership , as it comes after his appointment as a member of the shadow cabinet and after his speech at the TU@@ C Annual Meeting on Tuesday .
meanwhile , the Labour Chairman &apos;s decision to remain silent on Tuesday during a commem@@ oration ceremony for the 7@@ 5th anniversary of the Battle of Britain has provoked criticism of a number of T@@ ory MPs and is at the heart of several titles of Tit@@ les in the newspapers .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s decision not to sing the national an@@ them has drawn attention
a spokes@@ man by Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said he had &quot; stood in respect@@ ful silence &quot; and recognised the &quot; hero@@ ism of the Royal Air Force in the Battle of Britain . &quot;
but a member of Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s shadow cab@@ in@@ ett , O@@ wen Smith , told the BBC Two News@@ night program , he advised the Labour leader to sing the national an@@ them , &quot; regardless &quot; of his belief that the monarchy should be abol@@ ished .
almost a dozen of shadow ministers have refused to serve in Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s top team , and they appeal to differences in the economy , defence and foreign policy , while less than a sixth of the Par@@ liam@@ entary Party originally supported him as a leader .
the political correspon@@ dent of the BBC Robin Bran@@ t says that political differences are also &quot; stack@@ ed &quot; within the framework of Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s remarks on the position of the European Union and the limitation of women .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said the TU@@ C conference that Labour has made changes to remove the whole idea of limitation altogether .
hours later Mr Smith , the Shadow Labour and R@@ ent Minister , said that the party was &quot; very clear &quot; that it was only against the government plans to lower the limit of 26@@ ,000 pounds to 23@@ ,000 pounds .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n will be the fifth Labour leader David Cameron , since he has been a T@@ ory boss over the last decade over the Dis@@ patch box in the Parliament .
the Labour leader , who has promised another politi@@ cian , says that he has ideas on Mr Cameron &apos;s &quot; Crow@@ d @-@ sour@@ ced &quot; and gave him more than 30,000 suggestions .
the Is@@ lington North MP said that the prime minister &apos;s questions are too confron@@ t@@ ational , and that he will be subjected to both &quot; dr@@ y@@ ness &quot; and the stri@@ fe with bar@@ bs and has instead decided to focus on serious problems such as poverty , ine@@ quality and the challenges for young people .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said that Angela Eagle , who will represent the shadow economic minister if he does not participate - for example when Mr Cameron is on the road abroad .
he also had the idea that other colleagues occasionally took the word , and that he addressed John Ber@@ cow , the spokesperson of the house , to discuss the problem .
when he became a leader in 2005 , Mr Cameron said he wanted to remove himself from politics in the style of a &quot; Ju@@ dy show , &quot; which is often associated with the prime minister &apos;s cargo . but a few years later he admitted that he failed .
since it was first broadcast on television in 1990 , the freight @-@ wound with the Prime Minister was regarded as the most important bar@@ ometer of the judgment of a leader and his position among his parliam@@ ent@@ arians , although critics have argued that it has become a car@@ ic@@ ature and requires far @-@ reaching reforms .

pounds rise by accelerated wage growth in the United Kingdom
the pound went up ab@@ rup@@ tly according to data showing an increase in the growth of the United Kingdom &apos;s wage growth . in parallel , the FT@@ SE 100 was increased by the SA@@ BM@@ iller bid goal .
between May and July the result without bonuses in the United Kingdom grew by 2.@@ 9 % over the same period of the previous year .
this percentage has been the fastest and most successful estimate since 2009 over the time of an increase in interest rates .
the pound rose by more than 1 % over the dollar to $ 1,@@ 5@@ 50@@ 5 and climbed up to 0.@@ 84 % against the euro to € 1.@@ 37@@ 30 .
the FT@@ SE 100 Index included an increase of 1.@@ 49 % to 6,@@ 2@@ 29@@ ,@@ 21 .
SA@@ BM@@ iller was the outstanding share on the market and made a jump of 20 % after tak@@ eover offer of Ri@@ val AB In@@ Be@@ v .
a transaction would combine the two largest bre@@ wer@@ ies in the world , bringing brands such as Bud@@ weiser , Stella Ar@@ to@@ is , Per@@ oni and Gro@@ l@@ sch .
according to encouraging news from the competition group , Bur@@ berry shares were 0.@@ 9 % higher for luxury goods .
Rich@@ em@@ on@@ ts latest sales figures beat all expectations and also showed that sales in China - a key market for Bur@@ berry - announces growth again .
Gl@@ en@@ core &apos;s shares rose 5 % after the mining giant said that he had taken 2.5 billion $ through a stock sale as part of his debt reduction strategy .
the shares of the packaging and paper company Mon@@ di were the biggest los@@ ers on the index , with a decline of 4.3 % after Gold@@ man Sach@@ s had set his appreciation for the company R@@ ating on &quot; sell . &quot;
J@@ D Sports rose by 3.1 % after the sports management company reported a pre @-@ tax result of 4@@ 6.@@ 6 million for the first half of the year .
the chief of J@@ D Sports tells us that higher wages thre@@ aten growth .
the managing director of J@@ D Sports Peter Cow@@ g@@ ill says that a higher minimum wage for UK workers could mean &quot; more purchasing power in the pockets of potential customers . &quot;
but it is unlikely that this purchasing power will compensate for the higher labour costs in his company , he says .
the cost could meet the expansion plans of J@@ D Sports , he added , and that could mean that there are less additional jobs .

PE@@ G@@ ID@@ A poster adds Lebanese to potato cor@@ er idea
potatoes or D@@ ön@@ er ?
both are - namely in the potato cor@@ er , which the Ol@@ denburg plu@@ cking owner Han@@ i Al@@ hay has developed .
inspired by the saying &quot; Pot@@ ato instead of D@@ ön@@ er &quot; on a poster of the Pe@@ gi@@ da movement , Al@@ hay potato and meat put together on a sk@@ ewer .
the idea brought him a poster at a Pe@@ gi@@ da demonstration with the inscription &quot; Pot@@ atoes instead of D@@ ön@@ er , &quot; which he had seen random@@ ly on television .
since then there has been a barbecue grill in its shop , which is equipped with meat and potatoes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is multi@@ cul@@ ti for the stomach , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Al@@ hay . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the idea has now been signed by the Lebanese patent office in Munich .
according to the authority , it has recently been protected as a utility model .
therefore , as much meat and how much potatoes the sk@@ ewer contains , Al@@ hay does not want to betra@@ y .
only so much : &quot; it tastes better together , &quot; he finds .
culinary international understanding also goes well with its customers .
Met@@ cash La@@ un@@ ches Fre@@ el@@ ance Camp@@ aig@@ n to Com@@ bat Al@@ di@@ - In@@ come
Met@@ cash is trying to protect the I@@ GA branch from an Al@@ di rise in South Australia and Western Australia .
food wholes@@ aler Met@@ cash has launched a ground stand campaign to defend the market share of the I@@ GA retailers in South Australia and Western Australia in advance of a 700 million $ Al@@ di invasion .
while Al@@ di prepared the opening of two distribution centers and the first 120 stores in South Australia and Western Australia in early next year , Met@@ cash and I@@ GA markets strengthen their relationships with local food suppliers and build the I@@ GA brand through mainstream marketing and marketing on social media , as well as events such as Adel@@ ai@@ de Show .
Ig@@ A dealers and suppliers jump on board , with brands like ice maker S@@ imm@@ o from D@@ uns@@ bor@@ ough , who distri@@ butes samples in I@@ GA shops and shop owners who sell dis@@ counted tickets for the South Australian Football League to loyal customers .
it is expected that Met@@ cash will publish further details of its defense strategy on September 29 , when the wholesale supplier for food , alcohol and equipment conduc@@ ts its annual investment strategy day .
there is a lot in the game as South Australia and Western Australia account for almost 30 percent of Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s I@@ GA shops and generate higher profit margins than the Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s I@@ GA network in the Eastern states .
buyers in South Australia and Western Australia are not@@ ori@@ ously provincial and I@@ GA retailers have a much stronger market share than in New South Wales , Victoria and Que@@ ens@@ land - more than 30 percent in South Australia and 24 percent in Western Australia compared to around 14 percent in the Eastern states .
however , analysts like Morgan Stan@@ ley believe that Al@@ di will take around five percent of the food market in these two countries twelve months after opening its first markets , and will take away all existing actors , but mainly independent retailers .
according to a report published this week , the analy@@ st Tom K@@ ier@@ ath by Morgan Stan@@ ley estimated that I@@ GA retailers could lose 360 $ million turnover per year and met@@ a $ 250 million by the end of 2016 .
this pro@@ g@@ nosis is based on the assumption that Al@@ di will open 25 branches in SA and 30 in WA next year and will achieve a turnover of $ 500 million and $ 600 million in each market .
the loss in the food and food business and in the amounts on Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s &apos;s high fixed cost base could cost Met@@ cash around 13 million $ profit before interest and taxes , Mr K@@ ier@@ ath said .
at the same time , Met@@ a loses market shares in the eastern states , mainly in Al@@ di and Col@@ es , although a recent survey by Roy Morgan found that I@@ GA buyers are the most loyal .
Morgan Stan@@ ley believes that Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s will fall by 3.8 percent in 2016 , 4.1 percent in 2017 and 2.1 percent in 2018 , and will reduce the market share of 14 percent in 2015 to 10.@@ 3 percent by 2020 .
last week , the leading fund manager Ham@@ ish Dou@@ glass , founder of the Mag@@ ell@@ an Financial Group , told that Met@@ cash would probably disappear within a decade . met@@ cash will disappear .
Met@@ cash refused to respond publicly to Mr Dou@@ glass &apos;s comments .
but it is assumed that a board member of Met@@ cash contacted Mr Dou@@ glass last week .
since 2010 , IG@@ AS has fallen by 18 percent to 14 percent , and revenues from Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s &apos;s food and food trade , which supplies approximately 1,@@ 200 I@@ GA retailers , has fallen by 43 percent since 2012 , reflecting operational debt reduction with simultaneous pressure on sales and margins .
however , the wholes@@ aler is reluc@@ tant to invest more than $ 150 million in order to match sales prices with col@@ es and Wo@@ ol@@ wor@@ ths in hundreds of products every week and to improve I@@ GA retailers in improving their shops through faster growing fresh food and provide a better choice of private label foods .
Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s &apos;s chief executive , Ian Mor@@ rice , says that the price adjustments and loading re@@ plac@@ ements will grow to El@@ an and hopes that in 2017 the wholes@@ aler will return to a profit growth for the first time in four years .
Th@@ an@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is is supported by the President of the Australian tennis association Steve He@@ aly
Th@@ an@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is deserves more praise than criticism for his behavior .
Th@@ an@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is was one of the &quot; coll@@ ateral damage &quot; in the recent storm around his friend Nick Cy@@ cas and , according to the President of the Australian tennis association Steve He@@ aly , deserves praise rather than criticism for his own behaviour .
Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is , the younger of the talented Du@@ os , who is always referred to as &quot; Special K@@ s , &quot; came to the spotlight with St@@ an Wa@@ wr@@ in@@ ka on the Montreal Masters .
in a fi@@ ery qualification game in C@@ inc@@ inn@@ ati shortly afterwards , Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is and his opponent Ry@@ an Har@@ rison had to be separated twice by the refer@@ ee , Har@@ rison proclaimed : &quot; Wa@@ wr@@ in@@ ka would have had to beat Kyr@@ gy@@ z@@ stan , and I should beat the child . &quot;
while he was finally seen how he sm@@ ashed a tennis ra@@ cket after a cra@@ mp handled a potential US Open victory by Richard Gas@@ quet , Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is was defended by He@@ aly .
the teen@@ ager is currently in Glas@@ gow , competing with Sam Gr@@ oth for the second place in the single behind Bernard Tom@@ ic in the Davis Cup semi @-@ final against Great Britain .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one thing I &apos;m pretty en@@ vious about is the fact that after my view Th@@ an@@ asi was a bit dra@@ gged into the quar@@ rel , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; He@@ aly said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he has broken a ra@@ cket when he lost due to a cra@@ mp in the US Open but he is not the first player who has broken a ra@@ cket of fru@@ stration with himself , and I know Th@@ an@@ asi well enough to know that he is not proud of it .
but , really , he has beha@@ ved extremely well in the US Open , even under the rather pro@@ voc@@ ative circumstances with Har@@ rison and so on , and I think he deserves much recognition .
he has a great team around him , he has a great family around him , and I think he was treated a little too severely .
he is a very mature 19 year old , he works very hard , and he fits in the team and so on , he has never had a problem with the other players , he is well trained in the dressing area , he is a very stable and mature young guy , and I think he deserves to be judged by his own mer@@ its .
He@@ aly also supported the decision to not consider Cy@@ rene at an important decision which starts on Friday , and he describes the &quot; common decision &quot; as the right one for all , but he sec@@ ures the man from Can@@ ber@@ ra to return as a long @-@ term firm component to the team . &quot;
&quot; at first we want the team to be completely focused on the competition and not all the controversi@@ es around &#91; Kyr@@ gy@@ z &#93; , &quot; He@@ aly said .
and I think Nick made the ascent very fast , which people like Feder@@ er and Mur@@ ray pointed out . he has made some bad mistakes and deserves all the critic@@ isms he gets , but we try to help him understand the consequences of his actions .
Europe &apos;s refugee crisis : Hungary states not@@ ary , closes the border , keeps refugees back
Hungary declared the not@@ ary and sealed the southern border with Serbia on Tuesday and held out all who tried to get illeg@@ ally into the country . all with the aim of stopping the influ@@ x of migrants .
chaos followed at the border when hundreds of migrants gathered in a land of Ni@@ em@@ and@@ s@@ land , and Arab officials re@@ acted with indignation .
the people fle@@ eing from violence were stuck for an unknown time in a strip of land on the road between the two control points of the countries and built up tents and settled there .
but frustr@@ ations rose .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when a police helicopter s@@ wore over them , the migrants &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; open the border ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and scre@@ amed insul@@ ts against the Hungarian police . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
some returned from protest food and water .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Serbia &apos;s foreign minister declared that it is &quot; unacceptable &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that migrants from Hungary would be sent back , while more and more are coming from Macedonia and Greece . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
( Serbia ) wants to be part of the solution and not a coll@@ ateral damage .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the coming days , talks with Brussels and other countries must take place , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said I@@ vi@@ ca D@@ ac@@ ic in Prague . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the turbul@@ ence on the Hungarian @-@ Serbian border came a day after the 28 @-@ nation @-@ blo@@ c could not agree on a common immigration policy at a controversial meeting in Brussels .
the ministers , however , agreed to share responsibility for 40,000 people who were seeking refuge in the over@@ crowded Italy and Greece . they expressed their hope that after the next month or by the end of the year , an agreement would be made that the EU states would receive another 120@@ ,000 refugees , including some from Hungary .
German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria called on Tuesday to discuss a special summit in the European Union to discuss the immigration crisis of the continent .
Hungary , however , did not hope for a prompt action from Brussels or its neighbours .
the emergency shel@@ tered on Tuesday in two southern regions gave authorities more powers to cope with the crisis , so that they could block roads and speed up asylum procedures .
the Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter S@@ zi@@ j@@ jar@@ to stated that his country also plans to build a bar@@ bed wire along its border with Romania to stop the influ@@ x of migrants across the country - after finishing a fence on the Serbian border .
C@@ BS News correspon@@ dent Charlie D &apos;@@ Ag@@ ata reported that even prison guards were deployed in the race to create the bar@@ bed wire fence between Hungary and Serbia .
in recent months , Hungary has become a significant bott@@ len@@ eck and entry point to the European Union for many war refugees from Syria and elsewhere in the Middle East .
however , Prime Minister Viktor Or@@ ban insi@@ sted that most incoming economic refugees are looking for a better life , and not war refugees who are entitled to protection - a view that is strongly opposed to other EU states , including Germany .
the new laws that came into force at midnight in Hungary make the crossing of the border or the damaging of the 4 @-@ meter ( 13 ft ) high fence , which the government built along the southern border with Serbia , to a crime .
&quot; due to the situation created by mass migration , the Hungarian government declared emergency state , &quot; said government spokes@@ man Z@@ ol@@ tan K@@ ov@@ acs repor@@ ters in the southern city of Sz@@ eg@@ ed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we say it very plain@@ ly : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; illegal border crossing is a crime . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Parliament must still agree to the military use of the military , which will be expected next week , but repor@@ ters from Associ@@ ated Press have seen heavily armed soldiers with vehicles and dogs on the border for days .
Gy@@ or@@ gy Bak@@ on@@ di , country security advis@@ er to Or@@ ban , said that authorities caught 45 people trying to cross the border , 15 others had already penet@@ rated the country .
they come over by damaging the fence , they are now in police custody and are accused of off@@ ence of crimes according to the new laws .
authorities are quick to repair the fence .
Hungarian officials closed two of the seven border cross@@ ings with Serbia on Tuesday morning , after a train carriage with bar@@ bed wire to close the borders .
chaos surrounded the most important border crossing near Ros@@ z@@ ke , Hungary , when Hungary opened a small office in a metal container in order to process people &apos;s data and press a crowd of people to push themselves there .
about 20 managed to arrive , but thousands stayed outside .
another group of migrants blocked the most important motorway connection between Serbia and Hungary and said that they would refuse food and water until they are allowed to travel to Hungary .
election 2016 : H@@ illary Clinton &apos;s advance ahead of Ber@@ nie S@@ anders in national survey
former U.S. Secretary of State H@@ illary Clinton continues to maintain a double @-@ digit promin@@ ence in the democratic race around the nom@@ ination at national level , but Sen@@ ator Ber@@ nie S@@ anders wins her face to ground .
Clinton now has 47 percent of the Democratic voters in the pre @-@ election ( 58 percent before ) , while S@@ anders is second , with 27 percent ( increase of 17 percent ) .
vice @-@ President Joe Bi@@ den , who has not announced yet whether he is candidate for the Pres@@ i@@ dency , receives support from 15 percent of the Democratic voters in the pre @-@ election .
more than five months before the beginning of the elections , most democratic voters say it &apos;s too early to say that their opinion determines which candidate they will support .
but Clinton &apos;s supporters are more consistent in their choice than those of the other candidates .
since the C@@ BS News Survey , Clinton lost a number of demographic groups , while S@@ anders posted some gains .
Clinton has a major lead in women and moder@@ ates , but these projections have less@@ ened .
their support for the men has fallen sharply , and S@@ anders are only 5 points behind .
Clinton &apos;s advantage in democratic voters under the age of 50 has become volati@@ le , and they and S@@ anders are now at the same level .
Clinton , however , has a major lead in the older voters .
last month Clinton was ahead of S@@ anders with a double @-@ digit margin for the liber@@ als , but S@@ anders now has a 5 @-@ point lead in this group .
about half of the democratic voters of the local elections say nationwide that they would enthusi@@ astically support Clinton if nominated by the party .
a quarter would support her with some reservations and another 15 percent would only support her because she is the candidate .
they would not support six percent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; perhaps it is not surprising that Clinton &apos;s current supporters are particularly enthusiastic about it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the views are more mixed with those currently not supporting Clinton - just about a quarter would support them enthusi@@ astically .
while 48 percent of the democratic voters of the prim@@ aries say that they support Clinton with enthusiasm , less Republi@@ can voters say this about their top candidate Donald Tr@@ ump ( 35 percent ) .
when Clinton &apos;s supporters are asked in an open question why they want it to be the candidate , the most common answer is that it has the proper experience ( 16 percent ) , followed by the view that it is time that a woman president is elected ( 13 percent ) and that she is the best candidate for the job ( 10 percent ) .
Clinton &apos;s supporters also mentioned their connection with Bill Clinton ( 9 percent ) .
permission to deal with the problems and the choice are also quoted .
as the vice @-@ president th@@ rows a potential for the presidential office in the scales , 57 percent of the democratic voters want to see him in the race - even though a third thinks he should not do it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when democr@@ atically elected candidates are asked who would be their second choice for the party , Bi@@ den is at the head . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
more than half of Clinton &apos;s followers say that Bi@@ den &apos;s second choice would be far from S@@ anders .
if Bi@@ den decides not to run for the nom@@ ination of the Democrats , H@@ illary Clinton &apos;s lead is increased from S@@ anders , from 20 points with bi@@ ds in race to 30 points without him in the race .
fifty percent of the Democratic voters consider Clinton as a candidate with the best chances of winning the election ; however , this figure has declined by 78 percent last month .
Bi@@ den is by far a second in this measurement , but the percentage that looks at it as the &quot; eligible &quot; has risen .
nevertheless , in the question of what is more important to a candidate , Democratic voters call questions about the di@@ visi@@ veness .
similar to last month , not a single Democratic candidate or potential candidate for these sel@@ ections is unacceptable .
the demo@@ cra@@ cies or potential candidates produce good results in some important tra@@ its for voters of the primary elections of their party .
maj@@ orities consider Clinton , S@@ anders and Bi@@ den as honest and trust@@ worthy and equipped with strong leadership qualities .
Bi@@ den advises the three candidates best with hon@@ esty while Clinton &apos;s strength is the lead .
thirty percent of democratic voters do not believe that Clinton is honest and trust@@ worthy , twice as many say that about S@@ anders ( 15 percent ) , but 27 percent do not have any opinion about it .
democratic voters of the prim@@ aries generally see Clinton , S@@ anders and Bi@@ den ide@@ ologically in accordance with their views .
for all these measurements , about a quarter of the Democratic voters do not have any opinion of S@@ anders .
since questions about H@@ illary Clinton &apos;s use of a personal e @-@ mail address and a server will continue to be provided as the Secretary of State during the term of office , most Democratic voters of the prim@@ aries are happy with their explanation of the matter and say that it has not influenced their opinions .
but it &apos;s another story in the American public overall .
half of the Americans are now dis@@ satisfied with their explanation , while only about a third is satisfied .
public opinion on this was split in March , shortly after the problem came to light .
most Americans said that the e @-@ mail controversy had no effect on Clinton &apos;s general opinion , although 36 percent said that their opinion was still wor@@ sen@@ ing .
it is mainly Rep@@ ublic@@ ans , more than six out of 10 who say their views have become worse from Clinton .
although Clinton is regarded as honest and trust@@ worthy by the voters of their party , this continues to be a problem for them among registered voters in total : only 32 percent view them as honest and trust@@ worthy , eight percent less than last month and 15 points less since May .
62 percent of voting rights do not hold them for an honest and trust@@ worthy person .
at the same time , 55 per cent of eligible voters also consider Tr@@ ump to be non @-@ honest and not trust@@ worthy .
however Clinton and Tr@@ ump get good marks for guidance .
among the six candidates tested , Bi@@ den , Car@@ son and Bush best cut off hon@@ esty .
a majority regards it rather hon@@ estly , but as with Car@@ son many do not have any opinion about him .
the error rate for the sample of 3@@ 51 Democratic voters in the pre @-@ election is 6 percentage points .
Ben Car@@ son approaches Donald Tr@@ ump near nationwide survey
Ben Car@@ son is in the latest survey of C@@ BS News / New York Times close behind Donald Tr@@ ump
in the meantime , half of the voters &apos; support in the new survey is lost on the two candidates , and others lose a dramatic halt .
Republi@@ can voters continue to support Tr@@ ump in large numbers throughout the country . support increases from 23 % in the last C@@ BS survey conducted last month prior to Fox News debate , by 27 % in the survey conducted by Tuesday .
but Car@@ son dropped from 6 % to 23 % in the same period .
the survey also revealed that Car@@ son is well @-@ received in demographic groups and is sur@@ ging Tr@@ ump among Republi@@ can voters with higher education .
the rest of the field , with the exception of C@@ ello Fi@@ or@@ ina and Ohio Gover@@ nor John Ka@@ sich , is beaten with Wis@@ con@@ sin Gover@@ nor Scott Walker , who has fallen down the most , from 10 % support last month to now 2 % .
former Gover@@ nor J@@ eb Bush , former Gover@@ nor of Ar@@ kan@@ s@@ as Mike Hu@@ ck@@ abe@@ e and Florida Sen@@ ator Marco Ru@@ bio , are in third place with 6 % .
the error margin at the sample of 3@@ 76 people of Republi@@ can voters in this latest survey is plus or minus 6 % and was carried out in September .
the latest CN@@ N / OR@@ C survey , published last week , shows that Car@@ son increases in the poll@@ s - with 19 % support in the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans , behind the Tr@@ ump with 32 % support .
the latest survey by ABC News / Washington Post also showed Tr@@ ump clearly before Car@@ son .
looking at a Car@@ son rising last week Tr@@ ump found some si@@ eves for the former neuro@@ surgeon , even after Car@@ son ap@@ ologi@@ zed to question Tr@@ um@@ ps &apos;s faith .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need energy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Tr@@ ump last Saturday during a campaign appearance in I@@ owa . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
pleasant bathing temperatures : the eastern Mediterranean is currently up to 29 degrees warm .
even if peak values are measured only in the distance , there is already a trip to the Mediterranean for bathing vac@@ ation@@ ers to find even warm water .
a bath in the North Sea or Baltic Sea should be a rather short pleasure at a maximum of 17 degrees .
some people no longer go into the sea : a maximum of 18 degrees Celsius has the water in the North Sea and Baltic Sea this week , the German Weather Service ( DW@@ D ) .
bathing temperatures , on the other hand , continue to offer the Mediterranean : in the East it even comes up to 29 degrees .
in the Adriatic it is in the top 25 degrees , in France 23 degrees .
the Red Sea in Egypt reaches 28 degrees .
five members of the Brotherhood are bur@@ dened with the death of Bar@@ uch College New Players
almost two years after a student passed away during a schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ic ritual of a student connection in Po@@ con@@ o Mountains , Pennsylvania , murder charges are lod@@ ged against five people .
members of the New York Bar@@ uch College P@@ i @-@ Delta @-@ P@@ si Brotherhood attacked Ch@@ un &quot; Michael &quot; Den@@ g during an introduc@@ tory ritual in September 2013 and delayed his transport to the hospital , which contributed to his death , informed the police .
officials said he had been bur@@ dened with blind@@ folded eyes with a 30 pound ru@@ cksack full of sand , and repeatedly attacked while he tried to go over a frozen field to a destination .
Mr. Den@@ g finally compl@@ ained about head@@ aches , then he fell unconscious .
the members of the P@@ i @-@ Delta @-@ P@@ si Brotherhood did not call the emergency number 911 after Den@@ g was power@@ less and waited for an hour before they brought him to a hospital , the police .
but they had the time to change D@@ eng@@ s clothing , goo@@ gle his symptoms and contact Andy Men@@ g , the national pres@@ idents of the Brotherhood to get advice , said police chief Chris Wagner at a press conference .
&quot; at this point , the members began to hide the utensils and basically set up the well @-@ being of the Brotherhood over that of Michael Den@@ g , &quot; said police chief Wagner .
he could not be revi@@ ved , and he died the next morning at his injuries .
after an aut@@ op@@ sy report , Den@@ g was repeatedly added with bl@@ unt force injuries to head , tor@@ so and thi@@ ghs .
&quot; too many families have been destroyed by the ch@@ ic@@ ans of the Brotherhood . at least one student has died in the har@@ ass@@ ment every year since 1970 , &quot; said Douglas Fi@@ er@@ berg , a lawyer who represents D@@ eng@@ es &apos;s family , in an explanation .
bro@@ ther@@ hoods and their members must be held accoun@@ table , and this step by authorities is very important .
a County Grand Jury of Mon@@ ro@@ e recommended an indictment for the murder of the first five members .
thirty @-@ two members of the Brotherhood , including Mr Men@@ g , are also accused of mis@@ chi@@ ev@@ ous attacks and formation of a criminal association .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want not only to blame the people involved , but if there is an organization that has sanc@@ tioned this , we will also be accoun@@ table to it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wagner at a press conference on Tuesday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Bar@@ uch College has banned the Brotherhood , and the national Brotherhood has rev@@ oked their membership to the local community .
this will happen when the F@@ ed increases interest rates
an increase in interest comes , and the hous@@ ings are collap@@ sed , yields for bonds will rise , and the economy will slide into recession .
we know this .
what we do not know is how long this will last and how long it will last .
in particular , the history of the economy provides only a small guide to the process .
a recession came within just 11 months after the initial interest rate rise and lasted for 86 months .
the aggres@@ si@@ veness of the Federal Reserve when raising interest rates is often , if not always , a factor in how the economy and the financial systems react .
hence , representatives of the US Central Bank have stressed so severely that investors should not focus on when it begins to increase interest rates , but rather to the period required for norm@@ alization .
in fact , multiple variables play a role .
at the end , however , market participants could find that all the excitement was exagger@@ ated due to an increase in interest rates .
&quot; the first increase in the F@@ ed since the global financial crisis will inevitably be interpreted by some as a signal for the end of the &quot; cheap money &quot; era , &quot; said Julian Jes@@ so@@ p , Chief Econom@@ ist at Capital Economics , in a communication to customers .
in contrast , we do not expect the gradual return of US interest to normal heights , but still at a low level to lead to sei@@ s@@ mic shock that many seem to fear .
this does not mean , however , that there will be no impact .
here is a view based on historical trends how some areas of the economy could react :
as the market has seen last month , the anticip@@ ation of interest increases can make things volati@@ le for a while .
as soon as the up@@ li@@ ft@@ ment occurs , the influence is not so dramatic .
&quot; there is apparently a tendency that wealth yields may be reduced from 12 to 24 months after the first up@@ li@@ ft@@ ment , which might reflect the delay in monetary policy , &quot; said Deutsche Bank analysts in a recent study on what &apos;s going on after interest increases of the F@@ ed .
more precisely , the market is in the past 35 years mostly in the upward trend - about 14 percent - on the way to increase interest , fairly flat in the 250 days after that ( average profit of 2.6 percent ) , then back to normal state after 500 days , with an average return in the past six past cycles of 14.@@ 4 percent according to a current analysis , published by Bob D@@ oll , head of plant strateg@@ ist at Nu@@ ve@@ en Asset Management , at Bar@@ ron &apos;s .
Deutsche Bank said that the effects on the shares tend to appear later in the increases cycle and the return on investment begins to decrease .
rec@@ essions are a fact of economic life , but interest increases often promote it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the current case , the F@@ ed is confronted with some conditions that did not exist before and could accelerate a recession . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is extremely remarkable that the gross domestic product is close to its lowest point in the interest rate of the F@@ ed .
according to Deutsche Bank , only twice the nominal GDP of the 118 percent since 1950 was below 4.5 percent .
although the second quarter of 2015 was 3.6 percent , only a few expect this to continue and expect only 1.5 percent for the third quarter according to the Atlanta F@@ ed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; interest increases in such a fragile economic backdrop could be ris@@ ky and raise the question of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this time is different , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Deutsche Bank . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
market participants have taken a interest in the interest rate of the F@@ ed all year , and all eyes were directed at the meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee this week , which ends on Thursday .
while many strate@@ gi@@ sts and econom@@ ists believe that the FO@@ MC could appro@@ ve an increase in this meeting , fut@@ ures trading will only increase a chance of 25 percent .
&quot; in our study , all the training cycles of 1950 to now have taken place in a super cycle with increasing momentum in GDP and pre @-@ rec@@ es@@ sion@@ ers very quickly after the start of recovery in the shadows , &quot; says the report .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in contrast , this is a clearly slow recovery from what was the worst recession in the observed phase . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the current cycle is by far the longest that the F@@ ed has been waiting for since the end of the last recession ; the record was 35 months , and this has been 74 months .
the fixed income was also volati@@ le , as the market anticip@@ ates an increase in interest rates , and the pattern is quite similar to that of the capital market .
the main difference is that the effect of bonds is faster than in shares when they change their strategic course .
in the case of bonds , the returns seem to change direction as soon as the first up@@ li@@ ft@@ ment / lowering occurs in the cycle .
at the end of the enhancement cycle , the bond yields fall immediately , said the Deutsche Bank .
the strate@@ gi@@ sts of Charles Sch@@ wa@@ b believe that the rise in interest rates will result in returns between longer and shorter bond issues closer together and leading to a fl@@ atten@@ ing of the curve .
high @-@ interest bonds often generate better earnings in such a climate , although &quot; we are still careful to expect higher earnings , &quot; said Kath@@ y Jones , Fi@@ xed @-@ In@@ come analy@@ st at Sch@@ wa@@ b , in an analysis .
Jones insi@@ sts that the markets have already adapted to F@@ ed strategy expectations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition to the strength of the dollar and the decline in inflation expectations , there are some indications that the market has adapted to the prospect of stric@@ ter monetary policy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
short @-@ term interest has risen , the yield curve is fl@@ atter , credit tightening has expanded and volati@@ lity has risen - all the features of the market when the F@@ ed tigh@@ tens its strategy .
in large and whole , businesses that handle the greater part of their business operations in the US will benefit if interest rates rise and local products become more attractive .
multinational companies with high debt are getting worse , as an increasing dollar makes their products more expensive on the global market , and also the financing of their debts .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the story shows that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; quality &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tend to react very positively three months after an initial interest rate , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gold@@ man Sach@@ s analysts in a report for the customers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
companies with a strong balance sheet have sur@@ passed by 5 percentage points on average after each of the interest rate increases in 1994 , 1999 and 2004 .
companies with high capital yields and low volati@@ lity on their shares also exceeded their counter@@ parts with low quality by an average of 4 ( percentage points ) and 3 ( percentage points ) .
debt is a big problem .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; businesses with a high share of flexible interest will most lose , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gold@@ man said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; outside the pure stock games consumers will also benefit from the rising dollar . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
savers could see profits by higher yields , even though experts from different opinions are how quickly this will take place .
BBC Radio 3 is a copy of the Classic FM , says parliament member Andrew B@@ ing@@ ham
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Parliament &apos;s conserv@@ atives critic@@ ised the station for its &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; dou@@ bling &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he ar@@ gues that he is increasingly not distingu@@ ish@@ able from commercial ri@@ vals .
he also addressed the BBC Music Awards and said they only im@@ itated The Br@@ its
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Parliament @-@ Col@@ ony Dam@@ ien Coll@@ ins attacked the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Voice &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and said that this is not very original . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
BBC Radio 3 &quot; turns &quot; into Classic FM , asser@@ ts a leading MP and raises new pressure on the channel to prove that he does something that the private sen@@ ders do not do .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; conserv@@ atives &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Andrew B@@ ing@@ ham also said to BBC @-@ Bos@@ ses that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stupid &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and increasingly no longer distingu@@ ish@@ able from its commercial competitors . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; radio 3 seems - I don &apos;t like to use the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sil@@ ly &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he also focused on BBC Music Awards , which started last December .
the BBC Music Awards , which started last year , seem to be just under a different name .
so if you are trying to do something different - these are two spontaneously mentioned examples where you actually only im@@ itate what is already on the market , &quot; Mr B@@ ing@@ ham said .
BBC Director General pointed out the alleg@@ ations and argued that BBC Radio 3 is far ahead of its commercial competitors when it comes to live music and educ@@ ating the public .
what I &apos;m learning from Radio 3 , I won &apos;t learn about classical music anywhere else .
and there is a commitment to live music and music that is really uns@@ ur@@ passed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and the commitment of Radio 3 to find new music and to give new works &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the beginning of this year , BBC Radio 3 Controller Alan Dav@@ ey argued that it needed to be harder to engage the audience than it did in the past because the British were less informed about classical music .
however , Radio 3 was not the only element of BBC production , which during the hearing in the committee for the selection of culture , media and sport was under fire to tread the commercial ri@@ vals on their feet .
the T@@ ory MP Dam@@ ien Coll@@ ins picked up The Voice - the BBC &apos;s musical talent show , bought by the Dutch producer T@@ alp@@ a Media for an estimated cost of £ 22 million .
do you see why this program is often discussed because it is not original and not particularly striking ?
Lord Hall insi@@ sted that the BBC 1 @-@ Show - with Pal@@ oma Faith and Boy George as Ju@@ dge - &quot; was produced in a special BBC manner .
he added , he wants the company to &quot; find a hit from our in @-@ house stall , &quot; if the next time there was a series of entertainment .
however , he refused to exclude the order from other series of The Voice in the future or to give money to the fee ah@@ ler for other entertainment formats .
net sales were slow@@ ed down in August and Black Friday can be responsible for this
in the first three months of 2015 , there were seven percent increase in online sales .
in the last month , there was the lowest score since the beginning of the records in 2000
online sales increased three years ago by using mobile phones for shopping
experts believe that Black Friday in November has slow@@ ed up spending
for over a decade , the virtual shopping has dri@@ lled and many of Britain &apos;s main shopping streets have turned into gh@@ ost towns .
but experts say there is now evidence that online sales stagn@@ ate after new numbers only showed seven percent in the first three months of 2015 .
total expenditure for August presented the lowest increase in growth since the beginning of the records in 2000 , with only five percent increase compared to the previous year .
experts say there is evidence that online sales stagn@@ ate after new numbers show only seven percent growth in the first three months of 2015
&quot; if you look at the growth rates for the previous years and go back to 2000 , that has always evolved over time , &quot; said Andy Mul@@ c@@ ah@@ y , editor of the IM@@ R@@ G sales index .
he explained that the online sales increased three years ago when buyers started making purchases with their mobile purchases .
it meant that more people could buy online and that people could do this in different environments , e.g. at home on the sofa .
but now this is changing and we may see that the growth is dimin@@ ishing .
the Black Friday phenomenon imported from America is cited as a reason for decreasing sales .
experts believe that buyers will with@@ hold their purchases from this event , which takes place on the last Friday in November .
last year , five times lost the average number of buyers for their computers to make their bar@@ gains , and some dealer websites fell off .
experts believe that Black Friday , in which buyers have fought for bar@@ gains , could prevent buyers from doing purchases .

Muslims bury the killed in Mec@@ ca during crane accident - Bin Laden &apos;s family is sanc@@ tioned
the bodies of 29 deaths are carried by Muslims in the first funer@@ als in Mec@@ ca through the streets
Saudi Arabia pays tribute to the collapse of the huge Saudi bin Laden group
the Ministry of Health said that a total of 3@@ 94 people were injured after the crane collap@@ sed
hundreds of Muslims gathered when 29 of the victims were carried through the streets to bury the ones killed when a crane collap@@ sed at Mec@@ ca &apos;s large mo@@ ch@@ ee .
mourning @-@ filled , extensively dressed in white , the way to pay their respect when the first of the dead started their final journey to the Al @-@ Mo@@ Renaissance cemetery .
the procession went on in the Holy Place , where only days before , a building crane through the ceiling of the mos@@ que and then on the beg@@ ging collap@@ sed .
the bodies were released for funeral , when the Saudi king had imposed a sanc@@ tion on the Bin Laden family of the Bin Laden family because of the disaster that left 3@@ 94 injured .
the corp@@ ses of 29 worshi@@ ppers , who were killed when a crane rush@@ ed through the Great Central Bank of Mec@@ ca , were carried through the streets .
among the dead , Q@@ asi@@ m Ak@@ ram from Bol@@ ton , Greater Manchester , was the father of four children who was on his first pilgrimage to support the crane .
Mr Ak@@ ram was with his parents before the start of the annual H@@ addle in the Great Mos@@ que .
Saudi officials have already stated that the H@@ add@@ sch will continue to Mec@@ ca with thousands who will continue to come to the city .
today King Sal@@ man said that the Bin Laden group would not have stopped the arm of the crane when he was not used .
an Arab version of the decree issued by the state Saudi Press Agency said that the Bin Laden group was responsible for the collapse .
the news agency &apos;s English @-@ language service did not report this detail , but said that the leadership of the company had been banned trips abroad .
at the beginning of this week , Sal@@ man claimed to reveal what caused the overthrow of the crane , which rush@@ ed into an inner courtyard of the Grand mo@@ ch@@ ee , where hundreds of thousands of Muslims gathered in front of the H@@ add@@ sch , which is taking place later this month .
the Bin Laden Group has not issued any statements about the collapse of the crane , and its representatives were not available for a comment .
the Royal Dec@@ ree also imp@@ acted the group because of not current security measures and because it did not cooperate with meteor@@ ologists .
dozens of cranes surround Mec@@ ca &apos;s Groß@@ mo@@ sch@@ ee as part of the massive construction project led by the Bin Laden Group .
bin Laden &apos;s family has been associated with the Saudi royal family for decades and takes over major construction projects .
the late leader of Al Qaeda , Os@@ ama bin Laden , was a rebel@@ li@@ ous son who was ex@@ propri@@ ated by the family in the 1990 &apos;s .
the collapse of the crane came amid strong winds and rain , just a few days before the arrival of millions in the kingdom for the pilgrimage that is at least once in the life of any healthy Muslims .
officials said that 158 people stay in hospital .
government officials stated that 1 million Ri@@ al ( £ 17@@ 4,000 ) must be paid to the relatives of the killed and the same amount of permanently wounded .
other wounded receive half of this amount .
B &amp; Q Bos@@ s says that the time of cheap East European craftsmen is over
British employ increasingly tra@@ des@@ people , says Ver@@ oni@@ que Lau@@ ry
the number of skilled arti@@ sans from Eastern Europe has risen behind
this means that 200 additional Scre@@ w@@ fix stores target@@ ing professional tra@@ des@@ people will be opened
at the same time , King@@ f@@ isher will close 60 B &amp; Q points nationwide
by Ru@@ pert St@@ einer , City chief correspon@@ dent of the Daily Mail
it is alleged that Br@@ its lay their h@@ amm@@ ers and brushes in favor of the use of qualified Eastern European craftsmen who carry out work in their homes
if you can handle a hammer or a brush to paint walls , you seem to belong to a minority nowadays .
for the British increasingly employ arti@@ sans to carry out do @-@ it @-@ your@@ sel@@ fers in their homes , the head of the company behind B &amp; Q .
Vé@@ ron@@ ique Lau@@ ry , new Managing Director of King@@ f@@ isher , who owns the Bau@@ markt chain , said that a large increase in the number of skilled arti@@ sans from Eastern Europe who offer services at low prices has meanwhile been over@@ hau@@ led .
for this reason , King@@ f@@ isher is planning to open 200 additional Scre@@ w@@ fix shops , which are aimed at arti@@ sans and close 60 points of sale of B &amp; Q .
Mr@@ s Lau@@ ry said she wants to employ more women in B &amp; Q stores , because eight out of ten buying decisions in the store are hit by women .
at the moment , the men predomin@@ ate .
she said it is necessary to face the growing demographic trends that have more female single households that perform more renov@@ ations than in the past .
Mr@@ s Lau@@ ry said : &quot; it still works a majority of men in our stores .
we have to shift this more strongly towards a balance .
in principle , half of our clients consist of women with 80 percent of the decisions regarding the purchase of articles by women .
women play a major role in the decision @-@ making process .
Mr@@ s Lau@@ ry , who is one of just five women at the top of a British company listed in FT@@ SE@@ 100 Index , has also re@@ structured her top team to reflect an equal number of men and women in leadership positions .
King@@ F@@ isher is almost the only company that has owned exactly 50 percent of the team with women , including its management and Chief Financial Officer .
Mr@@ s Lau@@ ry said : &quot; this was a deliber@@ ate decision - diversity is an important topic here .
it was not difficult to find good women for our Supervisory Board .
King@@ F@@ isher reported a decline in the half @-@ year profit and sales after the group deb@@ ated the cost of closing the stores .
because of the trends King@@ f@@ isher , the Scre@@ w@@ fix and B &amp; Q , will open 200 new stores .
officials of A@@ ich / D@@ ob because of in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity in court
on Wednesday two officials of the Austrian volleyball tournament A@@ ich / D@@ ob have to answer two function@@ aries at the Landes@@ gericht K@@ lagen@@ furt .
the defend@@ ants were not guilty .
one of them was also accused of abuse of office .
from this alleg@@ ation he has been legally acqu@@ itted in May .
the current trial was postpon@@ ed .
according to the At@@ tor@@ ney General Robert Ri@@ ffel , the investigation revealed that in the years 2006 to 2011 , the defend@@ ants used money from club accounts , which they could dispose of in their functions , for private purposes .
it will damage the damage with around 400@@ ,000 euros .
the sports officials are also charged with financial loss .
this fact was divided by the chair@@ woman of the Sho@@ v@@ eller Senate , judge Micha@@ ela San@@ in .
it should be negotiated at a later date .
for the dis@@ fi@@ del@@ ity of the in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity , the defence presented that an asset was not created at any point in time .
the sports officials had only charged expenses and the sports club , for whom they had worked from 1982 to 2011 and in which they had invested a lot of time and money , came out of debt . in 2001 , the Passi@@ va amounted to around 600@@ ,000 Sch@@ ill@@ ings ( approx . 4@@ 4.000 Euros ) .
&quot; back then we stood in front of the situation : do we continue the club or block it ? &quot; told one of the defend@@ ants , in the bread@@ making of large @-@ scale audi@@ tors of the financial office .
with his colleague and co @-@ defend@@ ant , he then decided to take over this task .
with all risks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have advanced money , put our life insurance policies as security at the bench , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in the collection . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the association has agreed : you can manage the money freely , it is not allowed to make any debts .
furthermore , in the case of corresponding financial success , the withdrawal of the expense allowance had been resolved retro@@ actively until 1991 .
therefore , a part of the allowance for expenses occurred only years later , namely from 2003 , when a plus on the account had been paid out .
this is why l@@ ump @-@ l@@ ump and not detailed records seemed to be the same as the former chairman explained the proceedings .
the accounts and savings books shared the two defend@@ ants together , said the second accused .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why the payments were not disclosed in detail by the association asked the judge . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the association did not interest itself in detail for financial support , it was important to have only the freedom of debt , so the answer .
in 2011 , when investigating a function@@ ary investigation because of abuse of office , an amount of 120@@ ,000 Euros was transferred to the association &apos;s account .
these were the defend@@ ants , decl@@ aring the accused .
this securities account was based on the name of the second defend@@ ant and was not known to the association according to his statement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why ? , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wanted the judge to know . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
wher@@ eu@@ pon the respon@@ dent had no answer for a long time .
then he finally thought he had believed that this was the best for the association .
if something had happened to him , no one would have known anything about this money , the prosec@@ utor asked in the room .
the co @-@ defend@@ ant had been informed , the function@@ ary justified himself .
this transfer was formulated as &quot; claim compensation . &quot;
why in@@ dem@@ nity ? , wanted to know judge and prosec@@ utor .
wher@@ eu@@ pon the first defend@@ ant declared that he did not agree with this wording , because the association never made any damage .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but what should I do if the lawyer says , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; With this you are all from the tailor . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; am I a legal representative ? , &quot; he asked .
furthermore , the function@@ ary said that he never obtained a cent salary , he only charged mil@@ eage and di@@ ets .
on di@@ ets he charged the association 1,000 euros per month , but the actual expenditure was much higher , he added .
the defend@@ ants were not able to present exact documents for the early years .
these were no longer stored after an operational audit , in which everything had been judged correctly , they declared .
the second defend@@ ant also obtained o@@ dom@@ eter money .
all the adap@@ tations were made in cash , and he had to go to Blei@@ burg from his place of residence to the bank , he explained in his statement .
the main proceedings will continue on 23 September with the questioning of witnesses .
Hewlett @-@ Packard sets another 30,000 jobs
in addition to the staff cuts which have been running for three years , the computer will disman@@ tle further jobs in the division of the company .
the positions of the US @-@ Compu@@ te Hewlett @-@ Packard ( HP ) do not end .
as part of its restructuring , the US technology group plans to cut 25,000 to 30.000 jobs in its corporate customers .
as a result , costs in the amount of 2.7 billion dollars ( 2.4 billion euros ) are to be saved , the company announced on Tuesday .
the step will lead to a special charge of around $ 2.7 billion , which will fall from the fourth quarter .
the five @-@ year running of 55@@ ,000 jobs has not yet been completed .
at the end of the 2013 / 14 financial year , HP employed around 30@@ 2,000 associates .
listed below , the Hewlett @-@ Packard @-@ Share gave up 2.3 percent .
the company , which has grown up with printers from California Pal@@ o Alto , is currently spl@@ itting up : this is how the computer and printing business is to be pool@@ ed in a new society , separated from the more promising areas with computer servers and data storage for companies and other services .
both business parts are to be listed on the stock exchange .
another dis@@ ap@@ pointing PC he@@ el , as well as a weaker demand for corporate customers after his services , replaced the world &apos;s second @-@ largest PC manufacturer after Lenovo .
in the third quarter of the financial year at the end of July , sales of PC and printers declined by 11.@@ 5 percent .
sales fell by 8 percent to just under $ 25.@@ 4 billion .
in this way revenues declined in 15 out of 16 quarters .
HP responds with a breakdown and massive positions on the changes in the industry .
the 76 @-@ year @-@ old company led by Me@@ g Whit@@ man has recently re@@ acted to the fact that customers increasingly buy smartphones and tablets instead of traditional computers and do more and more shops online .
Whit@@ man &apos;s restructuring plans envis@@ age a total of around 55@@ ,000 jobs .
conflict : majority supports anti @-@ IS training mission
however , a direct participation of German soldiers in combat operations in Iraq would predominantly be rejected : 54 percent spoke against it , 35 percent were cons@@ enting .
the fact that other states fly air strikes against the IS in Iraq and Syria is 61 percent positive .
24 percent are opposed to interven@@ ing in the conflict .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a cooperation with the Syrian authorities Bash@@ ar al @-@ Assad weigh 51 percent of the respon@@ dents , 20 percent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke : violence in the Serbian @-@ Hungarian border
the Hungarian police deployed at the Serbian border at R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke Tr@@ än@@ eng@@ as and water rej@@ ectors against several hundred abandoned refugees .
the Euron@@ ews correspon@@ dent D@@ á@@ ni@@ el Bo@@ z@@ zi@@ k has witnessed the outbreak of violence at the border control point .
he reported by phone :
a group of refugees broke through the border .
behind it a police line had formed and behind the polic@@ emen was a water designer ready .
40 to 50 refugees started throwing stones , sticks and plastic bottles to the officials .
the officials initially set up continuous pepper spray .
then the police used tear gas .
a lot of tear gas was spra@@ yed towards the refugees .
thus the group was dissolved .
the refugees have now withdrawn somewhat .
a pregnant and apparently injured woman was taken away from the zone .
children who had inhal@@ ed the tear gas cried .
other refugees collap@@ sed and suffered from short@@ ness of breath .
the Serbian police press spokes@@ men also suffered injuries due to the use of tear gas and pepper spray .
time of Dec@@ ision on Inter@@ est Rates for the US Central Bank
the world ob@@ serves when the US central bank comes together on two days , Wednesday and Thursday to make the most important decision whether or not interest has been raised for the first time for almost a decade .
a survey among 80 econom@@ ists surv@@ eyed by Reu@@ ters found that a little more than half that was last week of view was that the F@@ ed will continue to do so , now thinks that the F@@ ed will remain a little longer and the interest rates on the current level of 0 - 0.@@ 25 percent will hold .
it is a historic event because it has been seven years since F@@ ed interest came to NU@@ LL .
&quot; for the first time , we are approaching a situation where a large central bank may leave the zero area and start a process of normal@@ ising interest rates , &quot; said Angel U@@ bid , senior employee at Peter@@ son Institute for International Economics .
the US economy is on a relatively good level of power , tri@@ l@@ lion dollars are added to the balance sheet and generate only low inflation .
however , the F@@ ed cannot ignore the less rough outlook on global circumstances .
it warned the markets to focus on an increase , but the signs indicate that the chances of such a move are good .
the decision should be announced at 8 : 00 CE@@ T on Thursday
death squ@@ ad at Delta State University left his ap@@ ologies
after shooting and killing his friend in Miss@@ issi@@ ppi on Monday morning - and before he shot his colleagues later on the day , Sh@@ ann@@ on Lamb wrote a note to say that he was &quot; sorry &quot; in the first murder and wanted &quot; he could make it happen , &quot; authorities announced on Tuesday .
the police in Gau@@ tier , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , said that Lamb , lecturer for ge@@ ography and social science education at Delta State University , called the emergency number against 10 : 00 on Monday morning
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; He shot a man and killed someone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
lamb said to the staff of the emergency call centre that the police had to send polic@@ emen to his home .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I shot my wife yesterday evening &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and he also mentioned that a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; cute dog &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is in the house but &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nobody will distur@@ b , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the police demanded the c@@ aller after his name , but he did not give it .
lamb was not an explanation for his shots .
when police hit the scene they found the body of A@@ my Pr@@ enti@@ ss , 41 , and a hand@@ written notice from Lamb , 45 , which said , &quot; I &apos;m so sorry I wanted to und@@ o it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I loved A@@ my and she is the only woman ever in love with me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after writing the note , Lamb sailed 300 miles to Delta State University , where he killed E@@ than Schmidt , a professor of history , before he finally took his own life on Monday evening when police surrounded him .
University President William La@@ for@@ ge said he didn &apos;t know anything about a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt , but &quot; of course there was something in Mr Lam@@ b &apos;s imagination . &quot;
despite reports on Monday , the Lamb supposedly believed that Pr@@ enti@@ ss had a relationship with Schmidt , authorities said on Tuesday that there was &quot; no information , no evidence &quot; for a &quot; triangle relationship . &quot;
Pr@@ enti@@ ss was described by Sha@@ wn O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en who said they were married for about seven years as a &quot; good person . &quot;
the two were divor@@ ced 15 years ago , but remained friends .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said he and Pr@@ enti@@ ss had a daughter who is 19 and she was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; destroyed by the ground . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said that Pr@@ enti@@ ss were her daughter &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; absolutely best friends . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Pr@@ enti@@ ss worked online from home , according to L@@ ins@@ day Know@@ les , which was identified by Sun Her@@ ald as a close friend of Pr@@ enti@@ ss .
Know@@ les said that Pr@@ enti@@ ss who had a dog named Light@@ ning had met with Lamb for about three years .
&quot; she always wanted to help other people , &quot; Know@@ les said
the police said , Lamb called relatives at a certain time on Monday to tell them that he is not going to jail . &quot;
when polic@@ emen caught him on Highway 1 near Green@@ ville later this night , Lamb drove his car to the side , fled by foot , ran into the forest and killed himself with a shot .
in spring 2015 , Lamb received a Ph@@ .@@ D. from Delta State University , how his life was on the University &apos;s website .

Eu@@ row@@ ings : Lufthansa is expanding the Group
the Lufthansa is planning a large group conversion .
the Lufthansa Group wants to save half a billion euros a year alone with a better organisation .
150 of the around 1,000 executives around the world will cost the workplace .
meanwhile there are new negotiations with the pilot &apos;s union .
Lufthansa is expanding its corporate structure and evalu@@ ates the company &apos;s own savings accounts .
the target of the real@@ ignment is an annual contribution of some 500 million euros per year from cost and revenue syner@@ gies , the airline announced on Wednesday .
among other things , Lufthansa will not be a member of the Board for the passenger business in the future .
the low @-@ cost airline Eu@@ row@@ ings should be developed as independent as possible .
in future , the management team headed by Managing Director Car@@ sten Sp@@ oh@@ r will be responsible for Karl Ulrich &apos;s Gar@@ n@@ adt for Eu@@ row@@ ings .
with the new order , Sp@@ oh@@ r under@@ lines the importance of Eu@@ row@@ ings , with which the company wants to compete against Ry@@ an@@ air and Easy@@ jet in the future .
up to now , the organization of the 120 000 employees has been complex .
the airlines operated under the umbrella of Passage Air@@ line Group , which represents three quarters of annual sales of EUR 30 billion .
new negotiations with the pilots
in the tari@@ ff conflict with the pilot association cockpit ( VC ) the negotiations are to resume after the court @-@ sponsored strike on this Thursday .
this shared the union .
the theme of the talks should be the retirement provision for pilots .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; cockpit wants &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in one year with a predicted record result &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as quickly as possible achieve sustainable results . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the conflict between the union and airline led to a number of strikes in recent months .
in addition to the transitional provision of the pilots , the background is the &quot; Wings &quot; division .
in the fight against competitors , Lufthansa is equi@@ pping routes to the company &apos;s own cheap airline Eu@@ row@@ ings .

Luke Sha@@ w of Manchester United can &apos;t play for months because of double frac@@ tures
Luke Sha@@ w suffered from Manchester &apos;s Champions League defeat at PS@@ V Ein@@ d@@ ho@@ ven a double frac@@ ture of his right leg .
while this brought the left outer defense to tears and exclu@@ des him for at least six months from playing , Louis van Ga@@ al does not give the hope that Sha@@ w can play again this season .
the injury was caused by a ru@@ th@@ less attack by H@@ é@@ c@@ tor Mor@@ eno in the 15th minute after the 20 year old Sha@@ w collap@@ sed into the PS@@ V area .
he was treated in the field for nine minutes and needed oxygen before he was brought to hospital .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; van Ga@@ al said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he has a double leg frac@@ ture and is in hospital . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he will be reloc@@ ated tomorrow or maybe a day later and then operated in Manchester .
it is terrible - a boy who comes to Manchester United with 18 , it has very hard and then plays fant@@ astically , and then that happens .
in the locker room he had an oxygen mask .
he wept .
I am not a doctor , but if you have a double frac@@ ture , then it takes six months and it will not play in the group phase .
I hope he can play this season again .
Mor@@ eno seemed happy to escape a red card and the im@@ position of an i@@ f@@ meter .
Nic@@ ola Ri@@ zz@@ oli , the refer@@ ee , did not punish the Mex@@ ic@@ ans .
van Ga@@ al thought that the Italian arbit@@ er had er@@ red .
you can judge for yourself if I say that a penalty meter and a red card were due .
it was a very serious attack with both legs .
a tweet to Sha@@ ws account was : &quot; thank you all for your messages . words cannot describe how broken I am , my way to recovery starts now , I come back more strongly . &quot;
related to this : Manchester United suffers the loss of Luke Sha@@ w in defeat at PS@@ V
with the European Championship in France , the UK def@@ enders have an additional incentive to recover until the coming of June .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Phil@@ lip Co@@ c@@ u , the PS@@ V trainer , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a very bad injury . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
when a player leaves the place with this kind of injury all are very sad about it .
it is never the intention of our players to hurt an opponent .
Mor@@ eno suffered a break when Mexico played against Van Ga@@ al &apos;s Holland team at the 2014 World Cup .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is very difficult because it was not his intention to hurt the opponent , and when you hear that it is a very bad injury it is not good , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Co@@ c@@ u . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for me it was not possible to see the moment .
the only thing I could see was the ball that was in another direction , so it looked like he had touched him &#91; Mor@@ eno &#93; , but I could not see the attack on Luke .
in conversation with S@@ BS@@ 6 , Mor@@ eno said : &quot; I know how it feels , I know how difficult it can be .
I feel very bad about it . I &apos;m so sorry .
the PS@@ V player Andr@@ és Gu@@ ard@@ ado was also taken to the hospital - after a b@@ oul@@ dering of Chris Sm@@ alling .

it is a matter that all parents will soon learn : if your child loves a book , it will not take long before you know it by heart .

everything nice and good , except that the following paragraph , in which Cameron is supposed to describe the story of the book instead , re@@ covers the content of the movie version of 2012 , adding new characters and details to extend the rather short original text .

as if this was not yet suspi@@ cious : the text submitted by Cameron reads partly like the summary of the Lor@@ ax movie presented on the website of Internet Movie Database and so begins : &quot; in the walled city of Th@@ ought @-@ Ville , where everything is arti@@ fici@@ ally and even the air is a commodity , a boy named T@@ ed hopes to win the heart of Au@@ dre@@ y , the girl of his dreams . &quot;
although he admitted to being a prag@@ matic father , it seems unlikely that Cameron is so little familiar with the story of the book . here , an Un@@ named boy hears , how the local environment is rav@@ aged by the gre@@ edy , tree @-@ prone , thri@@ ving On@@ ce @-@ ler , despite the protests of the name @-@ giving Lor@@ ax , a ho@@ ck@@ ling , pur@@ ging creature that speaks in the name of the trees . &quot;
most likely , such a relatively low PR task was deleg@@ ated to a hel@@ per who did not read The Lor@@ ax 20 times in a row .
a down@@ ing street spokes@@ woman said that the text was probably from Camer@@ oon &apos;s electoral bure@@ au .
Super@@ camp confirmed that the text was supplied by Camer@@ on &apos;s employees , but there were no further direct comments .
Adam Ly@@ th was clearly threatened with the expul@@ sion from England &apos;s crew , but it is still difficult
hitting Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates is a difficult task , but if you see the cad@@ re which England chose for the tour , there is a repetition of the 3 @-@ 0 test series defeat not on my map .
I would not exclude an out@@ going victory .
A@@ last@@ air C@@ ooks Page may be less experienced than those three years ago , but there are good spin players in the bat@@ ting list , and the community spirit is strong ; they will not carry any sc@@ ars from 2012 , just a you@@ thful @-@ positive attitude .
with the ball , Mo@@ een Ali develops as a spin @-@ punch and Adi@@ l Ras@@ hid , even if he is an unknown size at test level , is an option for the attack .
message related to this : Adam Ly@@ th turns out of the UK test cad@@ re and is replaced by Alex H@@ ales .
the decision to leave Adam Ly@@ th is , of course , difficult to analyse for me as his head coach in Yor@@ k@@ shire .
during his seven tests , there were two good attacks under difficult conditions , and the simple but hard reality is that cri@@ cket players are focused on results .
there were no question marks at Joe R@@ oot , for example , and that led to the nom@@ ination , there - and I said this before - players are their own best sel@@ ections .
long ago he would have extended the course of Ly@@ th , but he had control over his own destiny .
if he hopefully kno@@ cks out further shopping for Yor@@ k@@ shire , another chance will come .
the England @-@ Trainer Tre@@ vor Bay@@ l@@ iss praised his attitude even if he didn &apos;t get such good achievements , and that doesn &apos;t surprise me ; he is above all a team man .
the question of how much time a test drummer gets to set his mark is difficult .
Ly@@ th got seven chances - like Sam Rob@@ son in front of him - while Nick Comp@@ ton got nine .
only Comp@@ ton got the chance to play back and forth .
the only accus@@ ation that one can raise was that England first deployed Jonathan Trot@@ t in the Caribbean - when Ly@@ th was in top form - but this lost chance is now in the past .
Alex H@@ ales is coming in , and he &apos;s a drummer I highly recommend .
he is an X @-@ factor cri@@ cket @-@ player , which we saw at Yor@@ k@@ shire early this season when he achieved 2@@ 36 against us on a Tr@@ ent Bridge Square , which hit us very well .
he must have at least the same chances as those before him , but this of course depends on the team position in the United Arab Emirates .
the idea of making mos@@ ques beside Cook , which would yield an extra spin Bow@@ ler and get four Qui@@ cks , appeared , and I did nothing against it .
I don &apos;t see why a drummer can &apos;t beat there , and this left @-@ handed has already shown that he is a devil &apos;s cri@@ cket of cri@@ cket players .
mos@@ ques may not have done his job for his County Wor@@ c@@ ester@@ shire , but is he a number 3 for her , and there is no big difference .
my former team mate J@@ ustin Lan@@ ger played his first 38 tests at the first drop before he joined the Open@@ er in 2001 .
he made three hundred inst@@ ant@@ ments and did not look back .
Z@@ afar Ans@@ ari comes in the cad@@ res as back @-@ up sp@@ inner , and in my limited handling with him he has impressed me as a young man .
people may see his statistics on average 31 with the bat and 35 with the ball - and think it &apos;s a pun@@ t , but there is no large number of backup spi@@ ders who raise their hands and the trainers have chosen for youth .
he will learn a lot on this tour .
apart from the team , England has made some clever additions to the coach .
the appointment of Mah@@ ela J@@ ay@@ awar@@ es , the b@@ ats@@ man from Sri Lanka , as a consultant for the test games could be a master coup .
he is one of the nic@@ est guys in the game that will bring a wealth of experience as he has played under all conditions and against all attacks .
Paul Coll@@ ing@@ wood comes for the white ball phase of the tour and brings energy and a powerful insert into the setup .
I always felt that he was created for the international cri@@ cket competition , as a player or as a coach , and like Mah@@ ela he has insights from which we can profit .
sometimes new voices can bring fresh winds in the locker room , even if the messages are in line with what has been said before .
coll@@ ys te@@ amm@@ ate at Dur@@ ham , Ben St@@ okes , is not used for the One Day@@ ers , R@@ oot got a similar break against Australia and I for my part have no problem with it .
some will not agree , but coaches and team players do not determine the schedule .
and you must remember that as with the players , their jobs depend on the results .
such decisions are not taken lightly .
the Bre@@ x@@ it Camp ( Bre@@ x@@ it = UK &apos;s exit from the EU ) could gain access if the economy is in a sl@@ um by 2017
David Cameron &apos;s uns@@ atis@@ fied ren@@ eg@@ oti@@ ation strategy to keep Britain in the EU will get deeper every day , even without the choice of brilliant Jerem@@ y &quot; Is it Yes or No ? &quot; Cor@@ by@@ n to the leader of Labour or the TU@@ C , who fought hard for Europe on Tuesday .
foreigners also have their Cor@@ by@@ ns and Ni@@ gel Far@@ ages .
a European diplom@@ at che@@ ap@@ ly said that some member states , as deeply mi@@ red in different crises , as the EU is now and are not always full of their own guilt , Britain &apos;s own agenda with split concessions and disrup@@ tive treaty changes that they usually do not want .
in Bri@@ gh@@ ton , the TU@@ C decided at its annual meeting that it does not like it if it end@@ angers the social protection .
we could also call it Dave and Georges Sel@@ f@@ ie @-@ Agenda .
Prime Minister and Finance Minister climb on summit or bilateral meetings in foreign capitals , make a photo of themselves before a famous local monument , with or without local sizes , then come home and say that they can win allies for reforms .
it &apos;s always about me .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my European friend , looking for Britain outside the EU tent - &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; L@@ ass us not alone with France , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Berlin - and lets see that there are more and more short @-@ si@@ ghted ministers and officials in some capitals to the point where it doesn &apos;t matter whether we stay or go . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Germany &apos;s cau@@ tious German chan@@ cell@@ or Angela Merkel is an ally , but she has been in power for ten years and wants to leave the office before it looks bad for her , as has happened in the over@@ power@@ ing long res@@ ins such as T@@ hat@@ cher ( 11 years ) , Mit@@ terr@@ and ( 14 ) and K@@ ohl ( 16 ) .
French François Hollande looks back on his re @-@ election or replacement in 2017 .
he is also a da@@ zz@@ ling force .
Poland may soon have a nation@@ alist right @-@ wing government , Spain a left one .
it is hard to imagine that they will get a leg to help the Sel@@ f@@ ie British whose energy should be better used to prevent Scotland &apos;s ex@@ iting from the UK - something that they don &apos;t want , because most of them have similar separ@@ ati@@ st tendencies .
hence , some such ministers may even deliberately not plan helpful comments , entirely in SN@@ P style , during the UK referendum in 2017 to speed up the Bre@@ x@@ it process , my boy@@ friend susp@@ ects .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the ren@@ eg@@ oti@@ ation was a bankrupt@@ cy &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Britain has won nothing of value from the ren@@ eg@@ oti@@ ation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Europeans know how pre@@ dat@@ ory the Fle@@ et Street can be at its cost and which EU scep@@ tics ist the oli@@ gar@@ chy of the press icon , as it did during the 1975 referendum inspired by Tony Ben@@ n , which supported our 1973 entry with a ratio of 2 : 1 .
they can be weak to recall Boris Johnson , the Er@@ z @-@ Euro @-@ opport@@ unists who made a name as an &quot; EU @-@ straight ban@@ anas &quot; Brussels correspon@@ dent in the early 90 &quot; s .
with all his ma@@ dness Ed Mili@@ band knew who his enemies were .
to this end , the Med@@ ley belonged to tax @-@ fear@@ ing vil@@ la@@ ins , tel@@ eph@@ ones @-@ h@@ acking foreigners and the pseu@@ do @-@ non @-@ nationals who own most of our major newspapers .
actually Tony Bla@@ ir thought about them , but he noticed that if you sit with a hot gor@@ illa in a cage , you better distribute ban@@ anas in order to distra@@ ct him instead of his lunch and dinner .
indeed , Mili@@ band was more Bla@@ ir than Bla@@ ir himself when he opposed Cameron &apos;s referendum , because Bla@@ ir had the principle behind the un@@ adopted constitution of the EU , which was then rejected by French and Dutch voters in 2005 , which opened a backdoor .
the press has never forgiven him either .
but the nice Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ n who gave me a friendly rap@@ es@@ eed on Monday in Westminster - I told him that he didn &apos;t need time for me - seems at risk to repeat N@@ eil &apos;s boy@@ cot@@ t Boy@@ cot@@ t Mur@@ doch &apos;s strategy of the 80 &quot; s , a mistake back then and today .
it may take , but he must develop a coherent strategy to win the media , not with me , but certainly with Andrew Mar@@ r , whose BBC @-@ settee he left on Sunday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s official position on Europe is - I feel it friendly - in development . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says we should stay in a re@@ formed EU . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
now , most people outside of U@@ ki@@ ps &apos;s traditional Bl@@ auf@@ ar@@ bst@@ off tendency and the wild followers of Tor@@ ey Klein @-@ Engl@@ ish@@ dom can say yes to everyone .
it is what Hil@@ ary said &quot; A Ben@@ n , but no B@@ enn@@ ite &quot; Ben@@ n on the radio and on television this week , when the sc@@ outs strug@@ gled in it , not to admit that Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s appointment by the provo@@ king John Mc@@ Don@@ n@@ ell was a bad idea .
it reminded me of the 70 &quot; s when his old father tried to be il@@ loyal to his Labour Cab@@ inet colleagues without going too far and losing his cabinet job .
Hil@@ ar@@ ys &apos;s struggle was even more attractive .
but to fight to &quot; stay &quot; under all circumstances - B@@ enn@@ s expression - was not what Mc@@ Don@@ n@@ ell said , nor what J@@ C told his comrades and de@@ pu@@ ties after all reports on their cl@@ auses on Monday evening .
whatever the touching @-@ up image of Cor@@ by@@ n wants to convey - remember that he even stir@@ red me - news discipline is important around the clock in the age of TV and above all in the whirlpool of social media , a breeding ground of par@@ ano@@ ia and betra@@ yal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is right to give Cameron not a free ticket to Europe that allows him to keep Lab@@ ours backing in the referendum campaign for a matter of course , as Mc@@ Don@@ n@@ ell said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Simon J@@ enk@@ ins thinks for sure .
but Mc@@ Don@@ n@@ ell and Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s fundamental ambig@@ u@@ ities for EU membership - in line with their B@@ enn@@ ite siege economy , their anti @-@ capitalist past - is no longer just a matter of es@@ ot@@ eric debate among left dissi@@ dents , for whom the nar@@ c@@ iss@@ ism of the small difference is a central principle of dog@@ matic disputes .
as with his ambig@@ u@@ ities to Nato - Tom Wat@@ son is convinced that J@@ C does not launch a campaign to leave - foreign diplom@@ ats will be obliged to try to find a sense of their superi@@ ors at home .
why should Paris or Berlin waste political capital - they also have mi@@ stru@@ st@@ ful voters - to make concessions to the British if all this can be point@@ less ?
the US is already quite disappointed with the weak military power in Iraq , Libya and Syria , even with a cost reduction in the T@@ ory government in power , what I was reminded on the start on Monday of something British In@@ flu@@ ence Security Forum called .
experts critic@@ ise Public Health England &apos;s report on e @-@ cigar@@ ettes
claims of a state @-@ financed agency that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are less harmful than smoking arose from a meeting of 12 people , some with connections to the tobacco industry , said researchers .
experts who write in the British Medical Journal ( BM@@ J ) joined L@@ anc@@ et by critici@@ zing the evidence used by Public Health England ( P@@ he ) in their report on e @-@ cigar@@ ettes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he published the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Basic Report &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; last month and describes it as a &quot; comprehensive review of the evidence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , some researchers have questioned the resili@@ ence of the data and pointed to the connections between some experts and the tobacco industry .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; an editorial in the medical journal L@@ anc@@ et last month attacked the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; exceedingly wind@@ y basis &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on which P@@ he founded his most important conclusion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; two other researchers write in BM@@ J and asked whether the claims &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; build on stone or sand &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Martin Mc@@ K@@ ee , Professor of European Public Health at the London School of Hygiene and Trop@@ ical Medicine and Simon Cap@@ e@@ well , Professor of Clinical Epide@@ mi@@ ology at the University of Liverpool , said : &quot; a basic principle of public health is that strategies should be based on evidence of efficacy . &quot;
they said that the public expects that &quot; the current best estimate is that &quot; the current best estimate is that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are about 95 % less harmful than smoking &quot; based on a detailed review of evidence and modelling .
in fact , this statement comes from a single session of 12 people who were conven@@ ed to develop a model for multi@@ disciplinary decision analysis ( Multi @-@ C@@ riteri@@ a Dec@@ ision Analysis - MC@@ DA ) to bring their opinions on the damage of various ni@@ cot@@ ine @-@ containing products to a synthesis ; the results of the meeting were summari@@ zed in a research report .
Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well said that a sponsor of the meeting was a company called Euro@@ Swiss Health whose managing director had previously received British American Tob@@ acco Products ( BA@@ T ) for an independent study .
he also signed the references of BA@@ T to public health in a sustainability report , they said .
one of the 12 participants at the meeting said to get funds from an E @-@ cigarette manufacturer , but not the funding he should have received after reports from the tobacco company Philip Mor@@ ris International , they added .
the reasons for the selection of the members of the board are not supplied , but include several well @-@ known e @-@ cigar@@ ettes , some of which also include an industry funding in the paper .
some other participants at this meeting are not known for their know @-@ how in tobacco control .
the P@@ he Tob@@ acco Directive also took part in the meeting .
the Group &apos;s research work is a sign that there is a lack of &quot; hard evidence for most products &quot; damage on most of the criteria , &quot; wrote Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well .
however , none of these links or limitations are discussed in the report .
Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well said that &quot; he says that &quot; there is no evidence that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes have been &quot; premature &quot; as a way to smoke for children or non @-@ smokers . &quot;
Pro@@ f Kevin F@@ ent@@ on , Director of Health and Well @-@ Being at P@@ he , said that BM@@ J &apos;s claims have already been re@@ acted .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; E cigar@@ ettes are much less harmful than smoking . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
every second life @-@ long rob@@ ber@@ y dies in his ad@@ diction .
all evidence suggests that the health risks of e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are low compared to that , but that we continue to study long @-@ term effects .
he has the un@@ ambig@@ uous duty to inform the public about what is evidence and what is not , especially if there is so much public confusion about the relative danger compared to tobacco .
almost 80@@ ,000 people annually die of an illness with regards to smoking , and smoking costs the National Health System two billion pounds per year .
by the clear presentation of current evidence that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are not without risk , but only a fraction of the damage caused by smoking , we fulfil our national jurisdiction .
BBC should give up E@@ ast@@ enders , says former boss of Channel 4
the former chairman of Channel 4 , Luke Johnson , said the BBC should stop sending programs such as E@@ ast@@ enders and The Voice . he said that commercial ri@@ vals would give &quot; their right arm &quot; for hit shows like the Albert Square so@@ ap .
Johnson said that the broadcast fee should only be used to make the type of programs that are not broadcast by other UK radio stations .
he critic@@ ised the BBC for making public @-@ legal programs that are likely to be seen by a smaller audience in tough controversial time slots against the most popular shows of their ri@@ vals and broad@@ cast@@ ers such as BB@@ C4 .
after the BBC Director General , Tony Hall , said the company wanted to do more in partnership with other organizations , Johnson said he tried to contact the BBC for six years at Channel 4 without success .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have problems with the idea that BBC programs are commissioned or broadcast , which are clearly shown by un@@ subsidi@@ zed ri@@ vals , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Johnson to the Ober@@ haus communications committee as part of his investigation on the BBC &apos;s future . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if you want to keep the broadcast charge , which I consider medium or long @-@ term not for a good idea , you should at least put your production on programs that others do not do or commission .
they send The Voice in a first @-@ class time@@ frame , because they want to reach as much support as possible for their future .
the idea that no one else would show this is a joke , it &apos;s ridi@@ culous , it &apos;s of course non@@ sense .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Johnson said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t see why a reg@@ res@@ sive tax is funded , which could also be funded without subsidies . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Voice is such a program , E@@ ast@@ bourne is another , ad@@ mitt@@ edly both own productions .
frank@@ ly , other channels would give their right arm for that .
I urge me to see how this should be public television .
I don &apos;t think that this would reduce the BBC ever .
Johnson , an entrepren@@ eur for series who led Channel 4 from 2004 to 2010 , said that the BBC was to blame for ratings &quot; because of the ambi@@ tions of people working there , and because they believe that this is the best way to secure long @-@ term support . &quot;
his comments on the BBC &apos;s most popular broad@@ casts are what the former conductor of Sky , Tony Ball , proposed in his Mac@@ Tag@@ gart lecture in Edinburgh in 2003 that the BBC should sell shows like E@@ ast@@ bourne .
Johnson said that the more public @-@ legal niche programs should go to BB@@ C4 , where you can &apos;t measure the audience , but they perform their tasks , and they can argue if they go to their hypo@@ critical missions to justify 4 billion pounds of broadcast , &quot; Well , of course , we have created all these obsc@@ ure programs that nobody has seen . &quot;
they put them in a window in which nobody ever wanted to see them .
for the broadcast charge , Johnson said to the committee : &quot; I urge you to find a more reg@@ res@@ sive system in terms of conditions , who can get the best value from this .
of course , you all think we all think that you get a great value for £ 150 a year here , but for people who have a lot of money for the £ 150 , ask me if that &apos;s true , because they don &apos;t consume much from the BBC .
the former Sky@@ - and Channel 5 boss David El@@ stein , who also testified before the committee on Tuesday demanded that the BBC should check their ethics mission , &quot; to inform , train and maintain . &quot;
he said that little of the BBC production would now officially be classified as education - he said that it was 1 % of their TV production and 0.1 % in the radio - and they should take an example from the public broad@@ cast@@ ers in Australia and Canada , for example , to &quot; inform , enligh@@ ten and enter@@ tain . &quot;
El@@ stein , the BBC , said that the BBC should do more in areas such as those of the Pro@@ ms , of which he said that only a handful of television will be shown , and enter alli@@ ances with commercial transm@@ it@@ ters to make everything available online .
&apos;@@ Son@@ o@@ genetic &apos; can control brain cells by sound waves
the video shows how the n@@ em@@ ato@@ des change the direction in the moment they are ir@@ radi@@ ated with sound impulses .
scientists have bred worms with genetically modified nervous systems that can be controlled by out@@ breaks of sound waves .
the tiny n@@ em@@ ato@@ des change the direction in the moment when they are ir@@ radi@@ ated with sound impulses , which for human hearing have too high frequencies to be heard .
the impulses work by switching Mot@@ on@@ eur@@ one cells that are genetically modified to carry the membrane channels that respond to ultras@@ onic waves .
read more about this topic : researchers read and write brain activity with light
the researchers said the worms showed the power of a new procedure called Son@@ o@@ genetic , in which ultrasound can be used to activate a number of brain , heart and muscle cells outside the body .
Sre@@ ek@@ an@@ th Chal@@ as@@ ani , researcher at the Sal@@ k Institute in La J@@ oll@@ a , California , told the Guardian that the procedure of one day could replace the deep @-@ brain stimulation , a invasive procedure that gives electric impulses in the brain of people to treat the symptoms of Parkinson &apos;s disease .
thread worms usually do not respond to ultrasound , but Chal@@ azi@@ ani noted that they did when they were surrounded by a fluid with micro@@ scopic air bubbles .
the bubbles , he found out , ampli@@ fy the ultrasound waves , which then penetrate into the worms .
the ampli@@ fied ultrasound waves work on structures called TR@@ P @-@ 4 ion channels and found in the di@@ aphrag@@ ms of some of the worm cells .
the sound waves cause the opening of these ion channels and activate the cells to which they are assigned , thus a report Nature Communications .
to create ultrasound @-@ controlled Nem@@ ato@@ des , Chal@@ as@@ ani genetically modified the worms that some of their mot@@ on@@ eur@@ ons carry TR@@ P @-@ 4 ion channels .
when applying ultrasound to the modified creatures , the sound waves are ampli@@ fied by the micro@@ bubbles and transmitted into the worms where they switch the changed motor neur@@ ons .
the process has some simil@@ arities with op@@ to@@ genetics , a ground breaking tool that enables scientists to turn on and off neur@@ ons with impulses of light .
but Chal@@ as@@ ani said that Son@@ o@@ genetics could have some advantages over this technique .
unlike light that needs to be sent down to the desired location in the brain , low @-@ frequency ultrasound waves can pass un@@ hin@@ dered and can thus be sent to the brain from above on the skull .
&quot; we believe that using gene therapy and a therapeutic virus it is possible to temporarily make the targeted human neur@@ ons vulnerable to the ultrasound signal in a clinical setting for certain neuro@@ logical treatments , &quot; said Chal@@ as@@ ani .
other applications could focus on muscle cells and insulin producing cells , he added .

according to Gav@@ in Gr@@ ind@@ on , cur@@ ator of Cru@@ e@@ ol designs and lecturer at the University of Es@@ sex , artists will become more critical and try to bring political works to the public outside galleries .

V@@ C@@ CP Creative Director Matt L@@ ever was amazed at the silence that prevailed around advertising for the Ce@@ BIT - through a lay @-@ out of the Ex@@ Ce@@ L calendar - and thought , &quot; Give them the campaign they try to avoid . &quot;
they played with the invention of a more realistic tender company advertising , but &quot; through the blu@@ ish of bright colours and animation , it remains stronger . &quot;

eight golden rules for living in student resi@@ dences
eleven years ago I moved into a student residence as a self @-@ forgotten 19 @-@ year @-@ old , still in faith in Ber@@ ets and moral rel@@ ati@@ vis@@ m , but only now do I remember the ten@@ se smile of those I have anno@@ yed - and the numerous , long @-@ term complaints about others .
most of what I have learned can be distill@@ ed into eight simple rules .
the entry into student residence ranges from slightly annoying to absolutely frigh@@ tening .
it is temp@@ ting to chat : people tell where you come from , whether and where you have taken Sab@@ bat@@ Day , where you stand in terms of Cor@@ by@@ n and why you &quot; hon@@ estly mar@@ m@@ ite neither love nor hate , because in seri@@ ousness , guys , it &apos;s just a yeast extract ha@@ ha@@ ha , I am in my room . &quot;
breathe through .
and help others to do the same - ask questions and show interest .
it distra@@ cts the conversation and helps you figure out the people you like in contrast to those with whom you would not speak even if your eyel@@ ashes were in fire and these fire extingu@@ ishers were .
let people .
people often turn themselves into beverages recipes , film @-@ night venues and municipal meeting points , but they are also places where people wear and under@@ wear their under@@ wear .
referring to this : don &apos;t remember to start a relationship at the university
intro@@ vert receives a rough treatment at the university .
your room should be a refuge but many student resi@@ dences form a room @-@ to @-@ room b@@ ypass culture that is friendly and social and can lead to lifel@@ ong friendship .
this can be hell for someone who is trying to recover .
nothing in the culture allows you to say : &quot; I like you and I want our friendship to continue , but you have to go away so that I get the energy I have consumed for interaction with you . &quot;
try to feel when a student is exhausted from con@@ vivi@@ ality - and send him an SMS instead of kno@@ cking .
apro@@ pos refu@@ eling : do it .
a guy in my residence halls had the idea that a closed door was an invitation .
he saw some things .
friendship closes by che@@ eks .
since you start the university at the peak of the back man@@ ia , the kno@@ cking on the doors of people to imagine yourself with a plate full of brow@@ ni@@ es is less strange than the welcome of the 1950 &quot; s &quot; welcome in the neighborhood , I have baked you something . so , and now please smile when I ask you some personal questions . &quot;
offering home @-@ made goo@@ dies is a good way to close friend@@ ships .
your ro@@ omm@@ ate feels bound to enter@@ tain and will eventually associate your face with a delicious surprise .
of course , this depends on whether you &apos;re an decent b@@ aker .
poorly mixed lum@@ ps made of flour , sugar and fat lead to people sleeping when you drop .
ste@@ aling food is a common crime in student resi@@ dences .
of course , the c@@ law of chicken is a theft , but is it the take of a drop of milk for your tea too ?
check this with the dairy owner .
the chances are good that they say to use themselves , even if they cook inside .
if someone ste@@ als your stuff , it &apos;s annoying and you have my compassion - but try to deal with balanced handling as my ro@@ omm@@ ate who added a r@@ ins@@ ing agent to her milk to punish thi@@ eves .
she is now in prison .
they should not make any noise that keeps people from sleep or work .
it is not only about being a decent person , but that in the tru@@ est sense of the pro@@ verb , you belong to the people sitting in the glass house .
a girl in my corridor asked her neighbours if it was something to make drums &amp; bass more quiet , because it was three o &apos;clock in the morning and she had a test in the morning .
they responded to this with even more loud music .
when they finally stopped at 5 o &apos;clock , she kindly allowed her neighbors to sleep two hours before she pl@@ ung@@ ed her own music , shut her door and went to her three hour test .
wouldn &apos;t it be romantic if your future spouse would accidentally move into the same residence ?
on the other hand , it wouldn &apos;t be very embarrass@@ ing if you have a ro@@ omm@@ ate for her future spouse , go to her , separate herself and see her every day and perhaps experience how she moves all together friends to herself ?
of course the heart goes its own ways - but if a hot ro@@ omm@@ ate is definitely not your future marriage partner , try at least to talk to your under@@ body a little reason .
in the exciting moment you notice that someone has his keys in his un@@ locked room , the border between an ul@@ k and mo@@ b@@ bing is fin@@ er than it seems .
a good st@@ ony is funny , but it takes only moments until it becomes a bo@@ omer@@ ang .
by hiding a valuable and am@@ using lesson about security - but never miss someone &apos;s room with tooth@@ paste and sham@@ poo .
close your door and put your keys in a glass of water that you put in the freezer - but t@@ ack@@ y your possessions on the ceiling no more than twice .
terra@@ ced houses for refugees , single mothers , Ger@@ ing@@ ver@@ nis@@ s
real estate entrepren@@ eur Markus Gil@@ dner is building row houses for people in Central Fran@@ con@@ ia for people who do not have much money .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for example , for refugees - but also as a signal : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not only refugees need living space , but also the only educ@@ ating mother and the Ger@@ ing@@ ver@@ nis@@ er . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I &apos;ll show you how to build cheap and good today , &quot; says the 44 @-@ year @-@ old in an interview .
thousands of refugees will push for the housing market .
entrepren@@ eur Markus Gil@@ dner believes to know how quickly affordable housing can be created : he builds terra@@ ced houses for refugees in a project .
Mr. Gil@@ dner , many refugees will push for the housing market .
what solution do you offer ?
Markus Gil@@ dner : the mass housing in containers or gy@@ ms has no sustainability .
for people remain a great part of this .
in the light of the flow of refugees , we need sufficient living space in the coming decades .
a very ban@@ al , three @-@ storey terra@@ ced house is the solution .
Gil@@ dner : a town@@ house needs least space .
it facilitates integration .
this is different if you put people in blocks of flats .
each of the six houses , which are currently being built in the pilot project , consists of three housing units for each of four asylum seekers .
each unit has two bedrooms , a bathroom , a kitchen and a common room .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it may be that many refugees will say it &apos;s peace again , I go back . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
then the houses can be easily rebuilt according to their needs .
how high are the costs ?
Gil@@ dner : the price for 160 square meters of living space per house amounts to 18@@ 4 000 euros , without land .
this is man@@ a@@ geable .
the construction lasted six months .
this is appropriate .
have the building regulations complicated their plans ?
Gil@@ dner : I did my project correctly .
especially complicated is the men@@ ac@@ ing men@@ ac@@ ing value of special construction and the pitch ordin@@ ance ordin@@ ance .
sp@@ ook@@ y .
it is still under construction , who creates three apartments in a terra@@ ced house , needs at least three places .
only in the cities is the place missing .
refugees and asylum seekers have no cars .
how did the residents react to their terra@@ ced house project ?
Gil@@ dner : there were those who accused me of creating luxury buildings for asylum seekers .
which definitely isn &apos;t right .
but do you not ag@@ grav@@ ate the competitive struggle for affordable housing ?
Gil@@ dner : true , we had a construction boom in Germany over the past five years , but luxury apartments have been built that can hardly afford any more .
my project has the message , even the normal people need living space .
not only refugees , but also the single mother or the Ger@@ ing@@ ver@@ nis@@ er .
I show you how to build cheap and well today .
this is what it is all about .

iOS 9 : how to get the new iPhone operating system when Apple update is released
the new operating system can be requested by going to the Settings App , &quot; General &quot; and then &quot; Software Update . &quot;
if it &apos;s ready , the phone gives you the option to download and then install .
some have encountered problems after the installation , as they get an error message telling you that the &quot; software update has failed . &quot;
to avoid the problem , users are recommended either to wait until the rush goes back or try to update via iTunes .
the phone itself guides you through the rest of the process .
this may mean dropping apps to create space - but Apple has made it more impro@@ b@@ able by stream@@ lining the update . similarly , it will be easier to do this by using a special tool to delete apps and then re@@ install them once the process is finished .
it is worthwhile to make sure that your mobile phone is charged during the update or is located near a charger , so that the battery is charged .
if the load is too low , Apple does not allow the update to continue , since the phone may switch on half way and this could lead to a break @-@ off of the update .

G@@ aus@@ el@@ mann supported the chess club in Bad Kis@@ singen with a donation , which chairman Alfred Klein opposed .
this makes it possible to record players who cannot afford to pay the membership fee .

G@@ aus@@ el@@ mann wishes that membership in the chess club and also friendly contact to the tennis club &quot; Rot @-@ Weiß &quot; is seen as an expression of his solidarity with the spa town .
district Office is looking for direct contact
Sal@@ u@@ dis and the senior centre Anton@@ isti@@ ft have joined forces under the coat of the Social Foundation and opened a new contact point at the Graf @-@ Stau@@ ff@@ enberg @-@ Platz .
in addition to advice you can also take part in courses .
the social foundation desc@@ ends from the mountain to the city centre .
more precisely , to the Graf @-@ Stau@@ ff@@ enberg @-@ Platz .
a new district office was recently opened there .
here , right next to the shopping market , you will immediately receive sen@@ iors and advice @-@ seekers information on questions such as health insurance or health care insurance .
for years , we have been working with our ambul@@ ant care service that often nursing relatives are left alone .
there are endless questions .
&quot; many services of the insurance companies are not rarely used because the complexity of the insurance companies is scar@@ cely understood , &quot; explained the new owner in J@@ utta Wei@@ g@@ and , who is also responsible for the Anton@@ ist and the City Hospital as well as for the ambul@@ ant service &quot; Ama@@ de@@ us . &quot;
in addition to consultations , the new district office also offers prevention , health courses and wellness .
to this end , the Sal@@ u@@ dis was taken into the boat .
therefore , you can use additional offers such as prevention , memory training or physi@@ otherapy treatment .
the offers of the senior centre and the Sal@@ u@@ dis complement each other in an ideal way .
Sal@@ u@@ dis stands for prevention , prevention and rehabilitation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the senior centre for care and care , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Hei@@ ke R@@ ie@@ del , Managing Director of Sal@@ u@@ dis . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the reason for the opening of the new district office in the city centre is to see both executives in particular demographic change .
because this makes a good decentr@@ alized infrastructure in the individual parts of the city of Bam@@ berg essential in the future .
in addition , mayor Wolfgang Metz@@ ner ( SPD ) under@@ lined the inauguration celebrations , the district office also dedic@@ ates itself to the association in old age : &quot; there are numerous events and offers on the programme and these invite to a regular soci@@ able meeting . &quot;
the Social Foundation thus makes a big contribution that sen@@ iors can live as independently and effectively as possible in their familiar environment .
the district office is open Monday , Wednesday and Friday from 9 a.m. to 2 p.m. , Tuesday and Thursday from 4 a.m. to 6 p.m. and Saturdays from 10 a.m. to 12 p.m .

Dr. Frank Müller acqu@@ ires practice field breaks and inv@@ ests 3@@ 10@@ 000 euros
Silvia Müller @-@ Gon@@ gol@@ l and Frank Müller ( from left to right ) take over the practice of Karl @-@ Heinrich and Ur@@ sel Fel@@ steh@@ ausen .
in addition , the mayor Bernd Bor@@ mann , economic promot@@ er U@@ ta Sei@@ m @-@ Schwar@@ tz and A@@ sen@@ dor@@ fs Mayor Hein@@ fried Kab@@ bert are also pleased .
in many places in the country doctors - A@@ sen@@ dorf , on the other hand , are missing : Dr. Frank Müller takes over the practice field breaks on October 1 .
while Ur@@ sel Fel@@ steh@@ ausen is reti@@ ring , her husband Karl @-@ Heinrich is still standing at half a position in the next few months .
after a reconstruction phase , Müller opens the practice on October 12 , and until then he has invested € 3@@ 10@@ 000 in the rooms at St. Mar@@ cell@@ us@@ strasse 6 .
it was aff@@ ection@@ ate at first glance when the Fel@@ steh@@ len years ago met Frank Müller and his wife Dr. Silvia Müller @-@ Gon@@ gol@@ l , who currently completed her vocational training at the Ver@@ dener hospital and wants to get into practice .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we always had in mind that the mill@@ ers would fit well into this practice , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Dr. Ur@@ sel Fel@@ ici@@ ausen and laughs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when I was there I just called her . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the couple Müller liked the idea to practice their own practice in A@@ sen@@ dorf in the future .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; proximity and constant contact with patients are very attractive to us , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the 39 @-@ year @-@ old Müller . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to know and accompany the families over the years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
as an advantage , he also sees to be his own boss .
and so it was agreed that the mill@@ er bought the house with practice .
however , they continue to live in Bruch@@ hausen @-@ Vil@@ sen .
the two @-@ time family father Frank Müller was also raised , his medical studies in Hannover followed stations in several medical practices and in the hospitals in Sul@@ ingen , Ni@@ enburg and Rot@@ enburg .
he is currently working as a senior physician in Sul@@ ingen , and in 2009 he was appointed senior physician in the Di@@ ep@@ holz district and is involved in a voluntary work in the DRC @-@ readiness Bruch@@ hausen @-@ Vil@@ sen .
starting September 19 , the practice will be prepared for the new boss .
while the surgeon works as a family doctor , his wife Ur@@ sel ( Intern@@ acional ) special@@ ises in gastro@@ enter@@ ology .
the Müll@@ ers , both inter@@ ni@@ sts , want to settle down as home doctors .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the end@@ os@@ copy comes out , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says the 38 @-@ year @-@ old Silvia Müller @-@ Gon@@ gol@@ l . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the reconstruction , the rooms will look more modern .
we will offer more ultrasound examinations as well as long @-@ term and stress @-@ EC@@ Gs and need a speaker room more .
in addition , the ED@@ V is completely renewed .
the mill@@ er will receive a total of 50,000 euros in the framework of a funding programme of the administrative district ( 25@@ 000 euros ) and the joint municipality ( 12@@ 500 euros ) and the municipality ( 12@@ 500 euros ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this shows how proud and happy we are to continue the practice , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; emphas@@ ises Sam@@ son Mayor Bernd Bor@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to Silvia Müller @-@ Gon@@ gol@@ l approximately 2000 patients come to the field of field breaks in every quarter according to Silvia Müller @-@ Gon@@ gol@@ l , about 500 in the North German average practice .
in A@@ sen@@ dorf there is another doctor &apos;s office .
a positive side effect of the practice tak@@ eover by Frank Müller : the pharmacy remains according to Ur@@ sel Fel@@ stand@@ offs in A@@ sen@@ dorf .
if no successor would have found it , she would have gone too .
by the way , those who visit Müll@@ ers &apos; consultation hour also look above all in familiar faces : take over the seven medical specialists and the cleaning power of the ri@@ ms .
with their bid farewell in A@@ sen@@ dorf an era ended , after all the medical doctors have practiced there for 30 years .
&quot; in the beginning we had only two rooms , &quot; Ur@@ sel Fel@@ steh@@ ausen re@@ members smiling .
a little melanch@@ oly will feel her already after the long time .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but we continue to live in Hohen@@ mo@@ or and will surely see many patients &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says the boarding school . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; her husband adds : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have a 6,000 square meter plot . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; until now I have always pressed on gardening , now that could be different . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition , the pair has two grand@@ children and likes to travel .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Croatia : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are leaving the refugees &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now border controls are also driven up at our southern border , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Minister Joh@@ anna Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the controls at the Hungarian border remain in parallel . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; still , it is clear that anyone seeking asylum can &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the emphasis is on the care and security of the people .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but it is clear that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that it needs clear signals , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Minister . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
people need to know that we do not accept unlimited migration flows , even beyond the Austrian @-@ Sloven@@ ian border .
it needs a controlled approach .
Croatia is considering &quot; Cor@@ ri@@ dor &quot; - Slovenia refuses
the Croatian government had previously announced that Slovenia would also leave the incoming refugees in the direction of Austria and Germany and , under certain circumstances , also set up corri@@ dors for the refugees .
this is what the interior minister Ves@@ na Gy@@ ör@@ kö@@ s Z@@ ni@@ dar did not see in Lai@@ bach .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the idea of corri@@ dors &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is absolutely unacceptable , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Slovenia is rather intensi@@ fying the surveillance of the border - especially in Hungary . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the other hand , the border with Croatia is already strongly controlled as the external border of the Schengen area .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as the Minister stressed , Slovenia intends to not ban its borders for refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; every member of the EU must fulfil its obligations , otherwise the system cannot function , &quot; said Gy@@ ör@@ kö@@ s Z@@ ni@@ dar .
as the Croatian government announced , the first refugees had already tried in the night hours on Tuesday to stop in eastern Croatia at the border crossing of T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik / S@@ id to avoid registration .
the Croatian police was able to pick them up in the nearby corn fields .
according to local media , police vehicles of the Croatian T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik have been meeting new refugees ever since .
it is mainly about Syrians and Afgh@@ ans , including numerous women and children .
rescue services and the Red Cross are already in action .
in the coming days , his country reck@@ oned with about 4000 refugees , said Home Secretary R@@ ank@@ o O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic .
in addition , buses from Pres@@ evo to the Mac@@ ed@@ onian @-@ Ser@@ b border , which previously had migrants to the Hungarian border , were re@@ directed towards Croatia , compl@@ ying with Croatian and Serbian media on Wednesday .
however , the Belgrade Government denied that it was to instruc@@ t people to propose certain routes : &quot; we cannot , nor do we want to do so , &quot; he said .
according to the media reports , a first bus with around 50 refugees in the Serbian border town of S@@ id arrived in the morning and further buses were expected in the course of the day .
about Croatia , Slovenia and Austria to Germany
the passengers were on the road all night from the Mac@@ ed@@ onian border , which was around 500 kilometers away from Serbia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we heard that Hungary agreed , so the police said that we should drive here , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said one of the refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they wanted to travel to Germany through Croatia , Slovenia and Austria .
with this , it could actually come to a further west @-@ located stretch of the previous Balkans @-@ Greece @-@ Macedonia @-@ Serbia @-@ Hungary , already predicted by ob@@ servers .
Croatia : &quot; comprehensive border control options &quot;
Croatia &apos;s Minister of Interior , O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic , stressed that his country has prepared corresponding plans for possible exceptional situations in the event of a strong influ@@ x of refugees .
he did not mention details , but pointed out that Croatia as a non @-@ Schengen member had &quot; comprehensive possibilities for border control . &quot;
you carry out strict controls in order to qualify for membership in the Schengen area .
Slovenia has been part of this since 2007 , the EU partners have consistently issued a good testimony to the country , which concerns the standard of border controls .
on the Serbian side there are still about 300 refugees stuck behind the Hungarian border fence .
according to the media reports , they spent the past night at the border crossing of Hor@@ gos , which leads to R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke .
according to the Hungarian authorities , the two border cross@@ ings Hor@@ gos and Back@@ i Bre@@ g remain completely blocked .
whether the remaining refugees would now want to travel to the Croatian border is still unclear .
the Serbian Interior Minister N@@ ebo@@ j@@ sa Stef@@ ano@@ vic tried to calm down on Wednesday morning with a local appearance in Hor@@ gos : he keeps the debates about alternative routes of refugees after the Hungarian border is now closed .
it would not be a question of very high numbers of refugees at the moment .
one could not yet say whether they would continue their journey through Hungary , Croatia or another country .
hel@@ pers advise migrants - dangerous - alternative routes
however , private Hungarian refugee workers have already begun to distribute maps to refugees on which alternative routes are drawn in Croatia .
however , the border crossing between Serbia and Croatia is not dangerous : in parts of the border area there are still 20 years after the end of the Croatian war still unused min@@ e@@ fields .
on Wednesday afternoon , the Croatian police announced that a team of mine clear@@ ers was sent to the border region .
stock exchanges : Ukra@@ inians pay 30 million dollars
Sup@@ ran@@ on@@ ok is said to have heard about a ring of cy@@ ber @-@ crime , accused of having provided insight into un@@ published financial reports and press releases on websites such as Business Wire , Market@@ place and PR News@@ wire since 2010 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the captured information is intended to have made insi@@ der transactions on the financial markets . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to the investig@@ ators , a total of more than 100 million dollars were launched .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today &apos;s comparison shows that even those outside our borders are ultimately entra@@ pped , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it says in the SE@@ C message . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the trials against 32 other accused in the case continued .
most of the accused date from Ukraine and Georgia .
the perpetr@@ ators should have acted both in the US and Eastern Europe .

F@@ ed@@ Ex review shu@@ ff@@ led , lowered finance outlook for 2016
F@@ ed@@ Ex reports dis@@ ap@@ pointing results for the last quarter , and the delivery gi@@ ants lowered his chances of winning a whole year because of the weaker demand for freight services and higher costs in his body transport service .
the company also said that it plans to hire approx . 55@@ ,000 seasonal workers for the holiday .
at this time last year , F@@ ed@@ Ex announced that the company would like to set up 50,000 seasonal workers for the holiday season .
the share fell over 2.5 percent in pre @-@ market trading 45 minutes before the opening on Wednesday .
F@@ ed@@ Ex Corp. said to earn a profit of 10.@@ 40 $ and 10.@@ 90 $ in the financial year ending in May , 20 c@@ ents less than in previous forecast .
analysts expected a survey of Fac@@ t@@ set 10,@@ 84 $ .
the lower prospect comes despite the price increases , which are average 4.@@ 9 percent and effective on January 4th and despite higher charges for bo@@ d@@ transport of heavy and large packages , which will be raised from November onwards .
the company said it nonetheless expected that the result will be increased compared to the previous year due to cost reduction , higher revenue and growth in online retail .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Chairman and CEO Fred Smith said that the company provides &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; solid earnings if one considers the weaker than expected economic conditions , especially in manufacturing and global trade . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the plans for vacation employment were announced one day later than that of the rival U@@ PS , who plans to hire 9@@ 0.000 to 9@@ 5,000 additional workers , approximately the same number as last year .
in the quarter ended on August 31 , F@@ ed@@ Ex served 6@@ 92 million , 6 percent more than in the previous year .
earnings per share amounted to 2.@@ 42 $ per share , just behind the 2.@@ 44 $ per share , which predicted twelve analysts from Z@@ acks of Investment Research .
sales increased 5 percent to $ 12.@@ 3 billion .
six analysts asked for $ 12.@@ 23 billion .
in recent years , F@@ ed@@ Ex showed a decline in international priority shipping , which caused sales in its unit express shipping to stagn@@ ate .
but the boom in online shopping increased the results at F@@ ed@@ Ex Ground .
in the last quarter sales increased by 29 per cent , but the operating result was basically flat because of higher costs for larger packages and self @-@ insurance .
the Express unit recorded higher revenues due to higher prices , while the result decreased because of higher operating costs in the freight business .
in pre @-@ market trading , about an hour before the opening , the F@@ ed@@ Ex stocks declined by 3.@@ 85 $ , or 2.5 percent , to $ 15@@ 0,@@ 15 .
on Tuesday , they lost 11 percent of losses for the year and 17 percent below a record high on June 11 .
on their most anticipated meeting in the year , Federal Reserve strate@@ gi@@ sts spend two days this week sitting around a 27 @-@ foot Honduras ma@@ ho@@ gan@@ y table to decide if it &apos;s time to lift the body for the first time for almost a decade .
a mur@@ al of the United States is located at an end of the decorated , two @-@ story sitting room .
the card is a reminder that the F@@ ed @-@ President Jan@@ et L. Y@@ ellen and her colleagues should set the economic interests of the nation before all other things .
the central bank has a double order from Congress : maxim@@ ising US occupation and prices here stable .
but since the great recession the F@@ ed leaders have acknowledged that there is an un@@ written third mandate : financial stability .
and this third mandate could be the X factor in a decision which is too tight to predict it . it will be announced on Thursday whether the US economy is ready to be we@@ aned from the unprecedented incentive by the close to zero short @-@ term interest rate since the end of 2008 .
although most of the data in the economy shows that it grows solid , recent turbul@@ ences in the global financial markets may sc@@ are the already cau@@ tious F@@ ed representatives afraid to increase this volati@@ lity by raising the interest rate for federal securities - and be it only a quarter percentage point .
&quot; obviously , the labour market and inflation are primarily the most important thing they are watching , &quot; said Lind@@ sey M. Pi@@ eg@@ za , chief econom@@ ist at the bro@@ ker company Sti@@ fel Nicol@@ aus &amp; Co .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I think if they were looking for a pre@@ text not to increase the interest rate , the increased uncertainty surrounding the global market is enough justification to continue &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is no consensus on what the F@@ ed will do , which sec@@ ures the financial market itself . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
about half of the econom@@ ists recently questioned by Blo@@ om@@ berg have predicted an increase in interest this week .
however , the financial markets await a wait of the F@@ ed , with a key indicator that shows only a 30 % chance of an increase .
this indicates a decline in the stock market if the F@@ ed increases the sentence , unless the strate@@ gi@@ sts dimin@@ ish the impact by promising that another increase is far from .
on Tuesday , the D@@ ow Jones Industrial A@@ verage value j@@ umped by 2@@ 28@@ ,@@ 89 points or 1.4 % to 16,@@ 59@@ 9.@@ 85 .
the action was triggered by expectations that the F@@ ed policy maintains the sentence this week , said John Lon@@ ski , Chief econom@@ ist at M@@ oo@@ dy &apos;s Capital Markets Research Group .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it would be a surprise if the F@@ ed would raise the sentences at that time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if she does it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she would have to go very far in her declaration to calm the financial markets in order not to panic . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
other experts argued that an increase in interest would calm the financial markets because it would remove the uncertainty about when the F@@ ed would act .
a month ago , the F@@ ed seemed good to increase the sentence by 0.@@ 25 percentage points this month , the first small step in a slow tightening of monetary conditions that would test the strength of recovery in the US .
Y@@ ellen had said in spring and early summer that this year , despite the complaints of liber@@ als , that more economic progress would be necessary to increase the sentence .
although the job creation slow@@ ed in August , the improvement on the labour market in this year was solid .
the unemployment rate dropped to 5.1 % last month , the lowest for more than seven years and close to the level that the F@@ ed looks as full employment .
wage increases have shown signs of recovery .
and although inflation was constantly under the annual target of 2 % of the central bank , the F@@ ed representatives said that the main reason is the temporary effects of significantly lower oil prices .
the economy &quot; can cope with higher interest rates and needs it because of the tension on the labour market , &quot; said Ian Sh@@ ep@@ her@@ dson , chief econom@@ ist at Pan@@ the@@ on Macro@@ economics .
but the financial markets around the world assembled at the end of last month , after China had de@@ valued its currency .
the D@@ ow Jones Industrial A@@ verage Value fell by more than 16 % in May , but investors feared that slow@@ ing down the Chinese economy would cur@@ b global growth .
the market has recovered slightly this month , with the D@@ ow being now around 10 % below the May pole .
the market turbul@@ ence for the F@@ ed representatives will influence the complex calculation when it is to raise interest rates .
&quot; if the events on the financial markets and the news on the weakness of the Chinese economy had not occurred over the past few weeks , they would tigh@@ ten the re@@ ins at this meeting , &quot; said Stephen D. O@@ lin , Senior Research Fel@@ low at U@@ C@@ LA Zim@@ an Center for Real Estate and a former colleague of the US Central Bank .
now he predic@@ ts that she will wait at least one month to get a better grip on the effects .
&quot; there is a lot of uncertainty about what will be the impact on the U.S. economy , and there are almost no reliable data describing the developments in China , &quot; O@@ lin said .
the health of the world economy is not the main concern of the F@@ ed , so it should not be included in the decision making process .
but in effect , the F@@ ed Monetary Authority has become the world .
the influence of the central bank in recent years has been enormous .
the mere mention of the former leader , Ben S. Bern@@ anke in 2013 , that the F@@ ed could &quot; narrow &quot; their monetary expansion , caused confusion around the globe .
in a world where markets and economies are increasingly inter@@ tw@@ ined , the F@@ ed representatives are expected to not only monitor developments elsewhere , but also consult other central banks and experts to gain a better understanding of the global economy .
its decision making is &quot; more art than science , &quot; said Zach@@ ary Kar@@ ab@@ ell , Head of the Global Strategy for Asset Management of En@@ v@@ est@@ net Inc .
Jeff@@ rey Lack@@ ner , President of the Federal Reserve Bank of Rich@@ mond , VA . , noted this month that &quot; the F@@ ed has a history of transactions on financial market movements that apparently are not associated with the economic fundament@@ als . &quot;
Lack@@ ner , member of the Federal Open Market Committee , who advoc@@ ates an increase in interest rates , cited decisions in 1998 / 1999 as an example .
a financial crisis in Asia caused the F@@ ed to reduce its benchmark interest by 0.@@ 75 percentage points in three sessions &quot; despite limited det@@ ectable re@@ perc@@ ussions for the growth in the US , &quot; said Lack@@ er .
a year later , the F@@ ed representatives revers@@ ed these cuts .
the F@@ ed was to put aspects of financial stability to the first place only during a severe crisis such as the 2008 market breakdown , said Adam S. P@@ osen , former member of the Committee on the Bank of England &apos;s interest rate assessment .
the recent tur@@ mo@@ il does not come near this level , he said .
&quot; she certainly does not want to get into the situation in which she is afraid of an increase in interest because markets are exciting , &quot; says P@@ osen , President of Peter@@ son Institute for International Economics .
the Federal Reserve Act still contains the double mandate and does not mention financial stability , and until this is changed I do not believe it should advance time .
do you need a great Thai market ?
try LA@@ X @-@ C in Chin@@ at@@ own .
yes , Chin@@ at@@ own
the market / warehouse was opened in 1997 and is owned by LA@@ X @-@ C Inc .
LA@@ X @-@ C is often referred to as Thai Co@@ st@@ co and is a Thai wholesale market which also sells to the general public .

there is even a car branch if you need motor oil .
the shop is huge and it takes about an hour to stroll through the corri@@ dors .
if the whole shopping cart makes you hungry , there is a meal in the LA@@ X @-@ C BBQ Express for you .
the G@@ ark@@ ü@@ che ( good and cheap ) in this shop is located close to the coff@@ ers and has various taking options .
what is there : do you need something - something - Thai ?
LA@@ X @-@ C probably has it .
products are inexpensive and a number of them are sold in large quantities .
fresh products include Asian specialties and regional Thai herbs , fruit and more .
the meat the@@ ke is extensive , as is the fish counter - the staff behind the counter will clean and filter the fish and even roast on request for you .

where it is located : the shop is located in an industrial area of Los Angeles at the edge of Chin@@ at@@ own and the city center - a few blocks away from Philippe The Original .
parking : LA@@ X @-@ C has its own parking area , along with other shops and restaurants .
even though the shop is well attended , it is not difficult to find a parking place .
Ho@@ y@@ ers@@ wer@@ da : small life aid for refugees
more and more refugees arrive in Germany these days .
a warm welcome is not possible without the commitment of innumerable volunteer hel@@ pers .
also in Ho@@ y@@ ers@@ wer@@ da there are a number of people supporting un@@ sel@@ fish asylum seekers in the city .
they include Petra and Klaus H@@ eine .
Petra H@@ eine is a teacher with body and soul .
she still enjoys teaching with her 74 L@@ enzen .
every Thursday she does it at the asylum seekers home at D@@ ill@@ inger Street .
there she helps refugees from Syria , Kur@@ dist@@ an , Kosovo and Pakistan to learn the German language .
of course , this is quite different than at a proper school .
Brazil &apos;s pa@@ edi@@ atric society Rio Grande promotes nutrition for healthy breast@@ feeding
the Brazilian pedi@@ atric organization SP@@ RS tries to inform women about how important good nutrition is during breast@@ feeding . it does this with the presentation of images of babies who are su@@ cking on breasts that are painted with representations of un@@ healthy foods .
breast milk consists of a variety of proteins , fats , vitamins and carbohydrates that give babies all the nutrients they need to build up a strong immune system .
due to the additional energy requirements , pregnant women and young mothers are advised to increase their daily cal@@ orie intake by about 500 calories per day .
however , new research suggests that higher cal@@ orie intake is not the only dietary modification that mothers should make .
a recent study conducted by Robert Water@@ land , Professor at the Bay@@ lor College of Medicine in Texas , showed that a healthy diet of pregnant women actually affects the genes of their babies and protects them from the development of tumours .
unfortunately , an un@@ healthy diet of the child can adver@@ sely affect the immune system .
exemp@@ tions for the new Bern@@ rie@@ der Sports Hall
the community at Bern@@ ried approved the construction application for the 2.3 million euro sports hall .
and he made an exception .
the roof may be fl@@ atter for solar panels .
the planning for the long @-@ awa@@ ited hall building on the Bern@@ rie@@ der sports grounds is progres@@ sing step by step : in the recent municipal council meeting , the elabor@@ ated construction application was denied without major discussions .
prior to that , the Panel had decided , among other things , an application for a structural &quot; exception &quot; or &quot; exemp@@ tion &quot; from the valid building plan .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; exception &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was permission for a special form concerning the roof construction . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; accordingly , a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; saddle roof with non @-@ sustainable first and roof &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; should be erected . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
background of the planning is the planned use of the roof surface for solar systems : &quot; this brings us a wonderfully large south @-@ roof together , &quot; explained mayor Josef St@@ eigen@@ berger at the meeting .
in the case of &quot; liberation &quot; it was again about the pitch of the roof , which is supposed to be under ten degrees for energy reasons - unlike in the development plan .
this significantly reduces the volume of the hall .
for this reason , a &quot; liberation &quot; was necessary because the construction plan regarding the roof disposition had no &quot; exceptions , &quot; whereby the Bern@@ rie@@ der municipal council generally de@@ parts more restric@@ tively in the case of liber@@ ating orders .
the gymn@@ as@@ tics construction however is not a recurring project : &quot; we do not create a preced@@ ent , &quot; says St@@ eigen@@ berger .
the gym hall at the Sports Centre is a joint project of the municipality and the S@@ V Bern@@ ried .
some 2.3 million euros have been calculated at the cost .
subsidies are expected from school and mass transport .
in the next step , the construction application for the 18 x 36 @-@ meter @-@ wide hall is now presented to the coun@@ cill@@ or for testing .
P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg moves to Sch@@ ong@@ au
the P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg hospital is to be closed earlier than planned - namely in 2016 .
at the same time , Dr. Wilhelm Fischer ( 66 ) is appointed as new Medical Director at the Sch@@ ong@@ au Hospital .
the station and the majority of employees move from P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg to Sch@@ ong@@ au .
this shows the surprising plans of the hospital GmbH of the county , who confirmed the coun@@ cill@@ or Andrea J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiß .
however , a decision on the board of directors will be made by the Supervisory Board , and this will take place on Wednesday , September 23 .
if plans were to be implemented , all of the nearly 50 employees at the hospital in P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg would continue to work .
the vast majority should move to Sch@@ ong@@ au with Fischer and the remaining In@@ ner station .
the rooms are available .
the employees who do not work with Sch@@ ong@@ au should be offered a workplace in Wei@@ l@@ heim , such as J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiß .
the employees are informed about the plans .
this change triggered the termination of Dr. Andreas E@@ der , who has been Medical Director of the Sch@@ ong@@ auer Klinik since the beginning of the year and is now switching to a private practice in close proximity to the hospital .
according to J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiß , the name &quot; Fischer &quot; came into play with the question of who should succeed him , who agreed to take the lead from 1 October and to switch to Sch@@ ong@@ au with his team .
for the house in Sch@@ ong@@ au this meant in every case a &quot; appreciation &quot; and a distribution of the offer in the field of internal medicine , &quot; says J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiß .
Fischer is a specialist for pac@@ em@@ akers and de@@ fi@@ bri@@ ll@@ ators .
Sch@@ ong@@ au ( 180 beds ) is specialised on gastro@@ enter@@ ological diseases .
over the next two years , fishermen with his team , if the supervisory board appro@@ ves , will lead both houses , until next year the former hospital of the pop@@ lar , which has more than 35 beds , is to be closed defini@@ tively in P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg after almost 140 years .
until now , the administrative district had planned this for 2018 , when the currently ongoing renovation of the Wei@@ l@@ heim hospital has been completed .
district coun@@ cill@@ or J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiß , who is also the Chairman of the Supervisory Board , faced rum@@ ours that the house , which is owned by the federal government , is to be used as shelter for asylum seekers in the future .
&quot; I conclude . &quot; as it goes on with the property , J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiß could not say there are several considerations .
at present , a short @-@ term care of Car@@ itas and a daily psychiat@@ ry are housed there .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what better could not happen to us , such an opportunity doesn &apos;t come again , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Fischer about the quasi @-@ reloc@@ ation to the Le@@ ch , which was &quot; positive &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a real perspective for the house where Fischer has been working as chief physician for over 30 years has not given it .
he was asked by Sch@@ ong@@ auer &apos;s colleagues to take over the post of the medical director .

j@@ agu@@ ette with two injured at Pr@@ at@@ au
two tractor drivers have been seriously injured during their maize harvesting on Tuesday afternoon .
during the super@@ sti@@ tion on a corn field near Pr@@ at@@ au ( district Witt@@ enberg ) several hunters were in action , as the police informed .
after a shot , a man of 63 and a 22 @-@ year @-@ old man suffered serious injuries and were brought to hospitals .
how exactly it could come to the accident was unclear at first .
the police det@@ ained .
missed 16 @-@ year @-@ old from Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate victims of violent crimes
a suspect has led the police to the corp@@ se of the 16 @-@ year @-@ old from Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate since Saturday .
in the inter@@ rog@@ ation , the 20 @-@ year @-@ old admitted that the young people were killed and thrown their corp@@ se into a se@@ wer in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen .
a 16 @-@ year @-@ old from Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate , who has been missing since Saturday , has fallen victim to a crime of violence .
the body of the young woman was found on Tuesday evening in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen near Kais@@ ers@@ lau@@ tern , such as the public prosec@@ utor and police told on Wednesday .
a 20 @-@ year @-@ old captured also on Tuesday evening , who in fact conf@@ essed the statement and led the investig@@ ators to the discovery site of the dead .
the 16 @-@ year @-@ old had been reported missing on Sunday morning after a visit to an autumn festival in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen on the eve of an autumn festival .
when searching for the young woman , the investig@@ ators first encountered personal bel@@ ong@@ ings of the victim .
in the case of inter@@ rog@@ ations in the circle of friends and acquain@@ tances there was finally a suspicion against the 20 @-@ year @-@ old .
the alleged perpetr@@ ator then led the police into a se@@ wer in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen , where the body was found .
according to the authorities , the arrest took place in the police station to kill the 16 @-@ year @-@ old and put the bodies in the canal .
the 20 @-@ year @-@ old should be presented to the Haf@@ hop@@ per on Wednesday , the investig@@ ators put a dead end to him .
an explanation of the circum@@ stance of action is to bring further investigations .
refugees need accommodation : study warns of housing holes
the situation on the German housing market is ten@@ se .
more and more refugees are looking for affordable stays .
the pressure on the housing market is growing .
social housing construction is facing a challenge .
the distribution struggles on the German housing market have long since begun .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the coming refugees and j@@ ob@@ seekers from the EU , more and more people are pushing for a market that is already over@@ bur@@ dened in many major cities . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they compete with low @-@ income citizens around the last affordable housing .
to meet the demand for affordable housing , 400@@ ,000 new units would have to be built by 2020 .
this is the outcome of a study commissioned by the &quot; Social Res@@ idential Building &quot; association .
for comparison : this year , 26@@ 0@@ ,000 units are finished in Germany .
this means that 140@@ ,000 dwell@@ ings are missing .
after the first three months of their stay , refugees are no longer required to live as asylum seekers in an initial accommodation unit .
many stum@@ ble across the housing market and lined up in the long queu@@ es in front of the apartments .
according to the Federal Statisti@@ cal Office , however , less than half of all asylum seekers lived for rent last year .
however , the negative development of the housing market is not only due to rising numbers of refugees .
the study also made significant om@@ is@@ sions in the housing policy of recent years .
Germany is shooting an apartment deficit that gets bigger from year to year .
currently around 77@@ ,000 dwell@@ ings have already been missing in the areas of the metrop@@ olitan area , compl@@ ains Matthias Günther , author of the study .
many professionals therefore lived in large cities of emergency in WG @-@ rooms .
young adults remained un@@ willingly for longer in the &quot; Hotel Mama &quot; because of the lu@@ te on the housing market .
in the big cities , the number of square metres per cap@@ ita has fallen for the first time in recent years .
in order to solve the problem , the alliance &quot; Social housing construction &quot; proposes a re@@ boot .
in doing so , new incentives should revi@@ ve social housing construction .
this could be wai@@ ved on the real estate tax and the land tax for subsidi@@ zed apartments will be suspended for a limited time .
in addition , according to the Alliance , attractive tax write @-@ downs are necessary .
the subsi@@ dy programme for Refu@@ ge@@ es of the State Bank Kf@@ W is already well @-@ suited for cities and municipalities .
a good week after the start , more than half of the approximately 300 million euros have already been accessed on Monday evening with 18@@ 4 million euros .
now the project could even be increased .
refugees have free mobility : Croatia and Slovenia establish Cor@@ ri@@ dor
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after Hungary , practically no passing is more , more and more refugees choose the way to Croatia . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Zagreb is announc@@ ing the transit through Slovenia to the north without hur@@ d@@ les .
but the route is dangerous though .
Croatia wants to communicate with the neighbouring country of Slovenia on the establishment of a corridor for refugees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I spoke to the Slov@@ ene internal minister , and if necessary , we will organise a corridor , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Croatian Minister for Home R@@ ank@@ o O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Slovenia lies between Croatia and Austria and is already part of the Schengen zone .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the EU country of Croatia is not yet a Schengen country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the shad@@ owing of the Serbian @-@ Hungarian border , hundreds of refugees came to Croatia to reach Western Europe from there .
500 people have come across the border near T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik , the Croatian television broad@@ caster RT@@ L reports .
Hungary closed its border for refugees on the eve of the day .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; new laws that came into force on the same day make good asylum procedures in Hungary almost unnecessary . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Croatia wants to allow the refugees to pass through .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Croatian Prime Minister Zor@@ an Mil@@ ano@@ vic said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can travel through and we prepare ourselves for this possibility . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
these people are there , they are women , children and men who want to live and achieve something .
but they are people who did not want to live in Croatia .
the Croatian police took up the first refugees at the border of Serbia in the morning to the neighbouring country of Croatia .
most of the media reports came from Syria , Iran and Afghanistan .
they came to the Serbian border town of S@@ id both by bus and taxis .
immediately after their arrival they would have tried to walk across the green border to Croatia .
at the Croatian @-@ Ser@@ b border , the refugees do not meet border guards .
there are other dangers for the border crossing : there are still sharp mines left in the Yugosla@@ vian civil war in the 90@@ s .
mine clear@@ ers are now to quickly create a safe passage .
however , after the closure of the border , hardly any more refugees arrive to Hungary .
on Tuesday , the police included 3@@ 66 attacked people .
shortly before closing on Monday it was still 9@@ 380 .
the new Hungarian laws classi@@ fy the overcoming and damage of the border fence as a crime .
35 criminal proceedings were therefore initiated in the South @-@ Hungary border town of Sz@@ eg@@ ed .
the convic@@ ted sentences thre@@ aten to five years and the deportation from the country .
according to the immigration authority , a total of 94 asylum applications were accepted on Tuesday in the &quot; Trans@@ itz@@ onen &quot; set up at the border , of which nearly all - 93 - were the most important transition R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; among the applicants , 13 families with small children and two older people are among the applicants . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on Wednesday morning , there would have been 40 refugees there .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , no one has more chance to get asylum in Hungary . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in Hungarian terms , Serbia is a &quot; secure third country . &quot;
the rejected asylum seekers have to be de@@ ported there .
only a few hundred refugees gathered in front of the &quot; Trans@@ itz@@ one &quot; in R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke .
workers began to clean up in R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke .
they collected garbage , which tens of thousands of people had left at the road@@ side over the past few weeks .
locking grids have been disman@@ tled and one of the recording camps in the border town has been rebuilt .
nobody wanted to express themselves about the goal of this conversion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Austria is only a few refugees after closing the border between Serbia and Hungary . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the country has also stepped up its border controls .
however , around 20,000 migrants remained in the country according to government information .
in Salzburg there are about 1400 people waiting for the journey to Germany .
train traffic from there to Germany was hal@@ ted in the morning at the instruction of German authorities .
in Frei@@ lass@@ ing , smaller groups of refugees gathered on foot regularly .
mayor drove &quot; str@@ anded &quot; over the border
&quot; after the bridge celebration on Sunday we were busy with the clearing , when ten people suddenly stood with travel caps at the entrance of the tent , &quot; said W@@ ern@@ stein Mayor Alo@@ is Stad@@ ler .
tourists , they wanted by train to Passa@@ u .
because Germany had surprisingly turned the railway traffic with Austria on Sunday , however , for them in W@@ ern@@ stein , &quot; said Stad@@ ler , who immediately offered his help and drove the rocks along with two other hel@@ pers and their cars over the border into the river Nah@@ e Passa@@ u .
prior to that , we first cal@@ med the unexpected guests , with a snack and a drink .
we said that we bring them by car to Passa@@ u .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was a matter of course for us , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Stad@@ ler in O@@ Ö@@ N conversation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they were very grateful .
a man was not allowed to don@@ ate a generous donation - 100 Euro for the fire bri@@ g@@ ade .
&quot; we were very pleased , &quot; said Stad@@ ler .
on Sunday evening in W@@ els , the str@@ anded train passengers had moved from an ICE to a regional train in the direction of Passa@@ u , after the announcement that the railway traffic was set to Germany , but still trying to cross the border .
but the regional train was turned off before the border in W@@ ern@@ stein am Inn .
in W@@ ern@@ stein , the border crossing is generally high in the course .
the Brü@@ cken@@ fest association with the Bavarian neighbors was soci@@ able on Sunday , Fri@@ days before a two @-@ b@@ ump @-@ run sporty - organized by Union W@@ ern@@ stein and Bavaria from Neu@@ kirchen .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Viktor Or@@ b@@ án now sends another tens of thousands to us is a logical result of a hypo@@ critical policy : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
instead of helping R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke camp at the establishment of structures that ensure human dignity , our Federal Chancellor officially put forward the position of the Hungarian government in the mist of Naz@@ ism .
the leaders of this policy are not only those Austri@@ ans , who are now confronted with cha@@ otic states in the border regions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; also the refugees will have to find that the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; promised land &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that she has invited and welcomed is nothing but another refugee camp . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in view of the ongoing streams of refugees and the approaching winter , it will be a great challenge to produce decent conditions for those seeking protection .
and it will be an even greater - to maintain peace , security and stability in Austria .
Konrad looking for 35@@ ,000 winter@@ proof lod@@ gings
Konrad , with the submission of refugees , has to do all his hands full .
Christian Konrad is used to his word weight .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the government has used the former powerful Rai@@ ff@@ eisen bank@@ ers to put quarters for the thousands of refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the chaos in the first tak@@ eover centre of Tra@@ is@@ kirchen has already gotten a grip on Konrad .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have no hom@@ el@@ essness in Tra@@ is@@ kirchen , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he reported of his first success . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the placing of the 20,000 refugees that came to Austria on Monday is without a great vor@@ tex , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Konrad and praised the organisational &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; master performance . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Ministry of Interior , on the other hand , spoke of a &quot; crisis @-@ like situation . &quot;
all in all , Konrad reck@@ oned with a demand of 85@@ ,000 qu@@ arti@@ s in the he@@ ur@@ ful year .
in order to meet the number , 35@@ ,000 accommodation units have to be found in the coming weeks - 20,000 are to provide the countries , 15,000 of the federal government .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; should there be more refugees , we can do it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but it &apos;s not a barrel without soil , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Konrad . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he has already held talks with the provincial tri@@ bun@@ es .
they would have assured him of creating quarters for the coming refugees .
&quot; things are going well in Upper Austria , &quot; said Fer@@ ry Ma@@ ier .
the former VP @-@ Mand@@ at@@ ary supports Konrad .
tomorrow there will be a meeting with Cardinal Christoph Schön@@ born , and it will be clari@@ fied how the Church will help .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; great expectations the asylum coordinator also puts into the ORF action &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Help like us . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the platform , individuals can easily offer accommodation .
in addition , one hopes for hotels that are empty in the winter .
Konrad and Ma@@ ier yesterday critic@@ ised the standards for accommodation as &quot; very high . &quot;
in times of emergency , it could not be that Qu@@ arti@@ er@@ geber had to observe a certain height of the towel bars or the size of the ceiling .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for a temporary time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; emergency standards &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; must apply . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in contrast to the Ministry of Interior , in contrast to the Ministry of Interior , Konrad res@@ ig@@ ns with his experience .
I am an older gent@@ leman , whom you don &apos;t say without further into the face of the un@@ truth .
persu@@ asi@@ veness is his most important weapon .
Konrad and Ma@@ ier do not give the republic any costs , as they themselves declared .
they want to increase their number of employees to three to four .
up to now , its own quest for districts has not been successful .
Konrad wanted to place a container at the Steph@@ an@@ splatz as an office .
but there are obviously problems with the approval .
Linz calls for a better division
for the time being , no opening of urban sports halls and other buildings such as Tips @-@ Arena and Design Center for accommo@@ dating refugees is planning the city of Linz .
this is not necessary at the moment , since it is possible to accommodate those affected without these measures , says mayor Klaus Lu@@ ger ( SP ) .
however , in case of an emergency further sites should be tested for their suitability .
the city chief critic@@ ises the division of the refugees in the federal state .
other districts must also make their contribution here .
seals : &quot; borders are not sealed &quot;
in a longer telephone conversation with the Bavarian prime minister Horst Seeh@@ of@@ er ( CS@@ U ) , Gover@@ nor Josef P@@ ü@@ hr@@ inger ( VP ) on Monday corro@@ ded further action in the refugee issue .
Seeh@@ of@@ er assured me that the German borders are not sealed .
the transfer of refugees to the Federal Republic of Germany continues to be possible .
however , there are now the corresponding border controls .
for the time being , special trains with refugees to Germany will no longer exist .
the asylum seekers , however , were brought to Germany with regular trains .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from the other EU member states , P@@ ü@@ hr@@ inger once again called for greater solidarity in the refugee issue . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that Austria is now also introducing checks to its borders is a logical consequence for P@@ ü@@ hr@@ inger &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from the Deutsche Bank &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; approach . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the next Run@@ t@@ astic is a question of time
the general refurb@@ ishment of the &quot; Neue Wer@@ ft &quot; in the Linz Industrial Line has been officially completed .
the listed IT Group S &amp; T is set up in four of the six floors of the office and production building , the rest ( 27@@ 00 square metres ) is to be rented to young , innovative companies from the technology area .
&quot; in IT , smart minds are our raw material - and we must try to work for us , &quot; says S &amp; D Group Leader Hannes L@@ haus@@ er .
he could imagine investing in the start @-@ up companies of the New shi@@ py@@ ard , and later to acquire some of them .
from the very beginning , S &amp; T wants to cooperate with the new neighbours - of which the haus@@ er promises a lot : &quot; the next Run@@ t@@ astic is just a matter of time . &quot;
1.7 million euros were invested by S &amp; T in the location , 3.3 million euros from the Tech@@ Center , which is one @-@ third of the city of Linz , the country of Upper Austria and the Bund ( FF@@ G ) .
the building is le@@ ased by Linz AG for 60 years at S &amp; T and Tech@@ Center .
30 percent of the 27@@ 00 square metres of residual space in the building are already rented , for an additional 40 percent there are requests .
Li@@ a @-@ Per@@ oni @-@ owner opened second shop in the arcade
the new shop focuses on fur@@ la hand@@ bags .
actually J@@ utta Br@@ eit wanted to buy a dog .
this project had to post@@ p@@ one the 49 @-@ year @-@ old owner of Li@@ a Per@@ oni in the Tau@@ ben@@ markt @-@ Ark@@ ade : after all , she has now gained an increase in the form of another business location .
in the Fur@@ la shop opposite the shop , in which she sells bags , suit@@ cases , shoes and clothing from different manufacturers , everything revol@@ ves around women &apos;s hand@@ bags by the brand Fur@@ la , wall@@ ets are starting from 75 euros .
larger bags and accessories cost up to 500 euros .
the new shop has been in operation since yesterday .
previously , several weeks have been rebuilt .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I have long considered whether I should open a store , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Br@@ eit says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the decisive factor for the decision was , among other things , that the fur@@ la producers , who are at home in Bologna , were fascinated by the idea of their own location in which only their hand@@ bags were sold .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are the only ones in the Greater Linz Europe that sell this brand , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the mother of two daughters who have Italian roots . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
her fashion interest has given birth to her mother in the cra@@ dle .
I like most if something develops and I can show new trends at affordable prices .
why so many women are wearing rap@@ ture at the sight of a beautiful hand@@ bag , the expert cannot answer with the last security .
perhaps it is because a beautiful bag re@@ alizes any outfit .
the Br@@ ull@@ j@@ es@@ macher from K@@ all@@ stadt
the P@@ fäl@@ zer ancestors of Donald Tr@@ ump came from a place named An@@ gi@@ ants .
some of them also connect to the billi@@ on@@ aire who wants to become US president .
Donald Tr@@ ump ( 69 ) is always good for setting off .
whether he expresses himself in x@@ en@@ opho@@ bic ways of expressing journalists or revealing knowledge gaps in international crisis policies - the candidate for the US presidential office is power@@ ing up the election campaign .
and cuts off well .
this is also registered in the Pal@@ at@@ inate K@@ all@@ stadt , where the grand@@ parents of the estate billi@@ on@@ aire come from .
the New Yorker with the fo@@ eh@@ hair@@ style is a term for many in the win@@ eg@@ row@@ er on the wine route .
some in the 1200 inhabitants @-@ place is related to it over -@@ zig corners .
his grandfather came from K@@ all@@ stadt in the Pal@@ at@@ inate : Donald Tr@@ ump , here in election campaign mode .
the K@@ all@@ städ@@ ter Sim@@ one Wen@@ del directed a movie about Tr@@ ump .
and what do the vill@@ agers think about being the most powerful man in the world ?
&quot; I think they find it exciting somehow , but are not so deeply impressed in their K@@ all@@ stad@@ ter style , &quot; says Sim@@ one Wen@@ del .
the native K@@ all@@ städ@@ ter has filmed an am@@ using documentary about the place and his famous children , including Tr@@ ump and the K@@ et@@ ch@@ up family Heinz .
Tr@@ ump , who is not known for mo@@ dest@@ y , comes to word in &quot; Kings of K@@ all@@ stadt &quot; ( 2014 ) , with the statement that he would certainly be successful if he would live in K@@ all@@ stadt .
he did not bring it to the king of the heart .
although there is respect for the performance of the family , but also tend to think that Tr@@ ump is a little bit a big mouth , &quot; Wen@@ del says .
inci@@ dentally , the nick@@ name , the K@@ all@@ stadt in the circle , l@@ ur@@ ks &quot; The Br@@ ull@@ j@@ es@@ macher &quot; - in High German : the An@@ ders , she says .
so Tr@@ ump comes from the village of the gi@@ ver .
the Tr@@ ump &apos;s success story began in 18@@ 85 when the later grandfather emig@@ rated and opened a restaurant for gold dig@@ gers in the USA .
the corner@@ stone of the real estate company was the first real estate in New York .
but the life of the grand@@ parents was not free of tragedy : their desire to return to their homeland in the long run failed at the Bavarian state , to which the Pal@@ at@@ inate belonged at that time .
he did not record Tr@@ ump because he had once been cut off without permission , the director of the Institute for Pal@@ at@@ inate History and Volk@@ sk@@ unde , Roland Paul , had declared a film start .
Tr@@ ump is the grand@@ son of an illegal immig@@ rant .
this contrasts with the sometimes distinctive statements of the descend@@ ant .
he had repeatedly spoken out about Mexican immigrants in the US and demanded the construction of a border wall to deter illegal immigrants .
&quot; as well as the Polish , it is not so symp@@ a@@ thetic , &quot; says Hans @-@ Joachim Ben@@ der , a distant relative Tr@@ um@@ ps ( &quot; The O@@ ma was a native tr@@ ump , the grand@@ pa was born Heinz &quot; ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the v@@ int@@ ner in retirement looks more distant from the Americans , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is always so lo@@ fty . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
does he believe that Tr@@ ump is coming ?
&quot; I can &apos;t imagine that , &quot; says the 72 @-@ year @-@ old .
&quot; he never cared for K@@ all@@ stadt . &quot;

seven &apos;s Sunrise is domin@@ ating the reviews , despite attempts by N@@ ine to take over the loss of leadership in the Today Show
Karl Stef@@ ano@@ vic and Lisa Wil@@ kin@@ son rush@@ ed to Can@@ ber@@ ra to report after the loss of the leadership of the liber@@ als , but there were no major shifts in the reviews for Today .
the N@@ ine breakfast show was broadcast by the federal capital when Mal@@ col@@ m Turn@@ bull created Tony Ab@@ bot@@ t &apos;s fall .
the rival Sunrise , with the pres@@ enters of David Koch and Sam@@ an@@ tha Ar@@ my@@ tage , was part of a one @-@ week series of international television programmes , including Dubai , New York , Ni@@ ag@@ ara Falls and Canc@@ un .
this down@@ side of the distance seemed to have no role for Australian TV spectators , since sunrise achieved an average of 39@@ 7.@@ 000 viewers in the five capitals , compared with today 33@@ 9.@@ 000 .
today , Today posted a slight increase in ratings for Monday ( 3@@ 17@@ ,000 ) and last Tuesday ( 28@@ 3,000 ) , but its number lag@@ ged behind the last Thursday ( 34@@ 3,000 ) .
today Today has closed the gap to Sunrise in recent months .
in August Today , Today , today reached 3@@ 18@@ ,000 in comparison to the 3@@ 30,000 of Sunrise .
at the beginning of the year the distance between 40,000 and 50.000 .
so far in September , sunrise has an average of 34@@ 9@@ ,000 spectators at 3@@ 14@@ ,000 in Today .
this is the most interesting thing that happens every morning .
the winds of change affect these morning people more than parliament !
Karl and Lisa are ok , thank you for the review !

the great news for Seven was the impressive debut of 800 words with the former Seri@@ enst@@ ar from Pack@@ ed to the Raf@@ ters Erik Thom@@ son .
the new drama about a recently @-@ wit@@ ted father , who decides to settle down with his two children on New Zealand &apos;s coast , reached a very impressive figure of 1.@@ 2@@ 19 million viewers .
critics had asked whether Thom@@ son could wear a hit show solo without the Raf@@ ters Star Rebecca Gib@@ ney .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the result of yesterday evening answers this with a clear &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yes &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the X Factor of Seven remained strong with 1.@@ 136 million viewers and struck easily The Block ( 8@@ 3@@ 8.000 ) and T@@ BL Famili@@ es ( 7@@ 26.@@ 000 ) .
seven had mixed results in the evening two by The Ch@@ ase Australia .
the first half hour ( 17 : 00 to 17 : 30 ) of the new qui@@ z show , hosted by Andrew O &apos;@@ Ke@@ efe scored an average of 44@@ 6.000 spectators .
the second half hour ( 17 : 30 to 18 : 00 ) j@@ umped to 6@@ 23@@ ,000 spectators - enough for a small victory over Ed@@ die Mc@@ Gu@@ ires Hot @-@ Se@@ at ( 6@@ 13@@ ,000 ) .
on Monday evening , the first half @-@ hour of The Ch@@ ase Australia recorded 5@@ 20,000 spectators and in the second half an hour a full 7@@ 20,000 .
hot @-@ Se@@ at average 6@@ 20,000 .
the decline in the quot@@ a of the second evening of The Ch@@ ase Australia will make N@@ ine confident that Hot @-@ Se@@ at will ultimately prevail at 5 : 30 p.m .
the Ch@@ ase Australia is a replacement for a million dollars that failed to over@@ ride the Mc@@ Gu@@ ire Show .

the last three agree : Bachelor Sam Wood is the perfect man - but who will he choose ?
mystery revealed ? ...
L@@ ana Je@@ av@@ ons Fel@@ lows , Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay and S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana Mark@@ os@@ ki may unknow@@ ingly have revealed who won the bach@@ elor .
the woman , at which Sam Wood finally lands in The Bachelor , was wrapped in the greatest sec@@ rec@@ y .
and none of the three remaining girls will certainly not reveal if she is the one who received the last rose .
but when we checked with Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay , S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana Mark@@ os@@ ki and L@@ ana Je@@ av@@ ons Fel@@ lows on the day before coming out of three , you may accidentally have given a hint on who will be the winner .
Sam Wood keeps his lips sealed until the final on Thursday
all three women have been ly@@ rical about why Wood is the perfect man and called his sense of humour , ambition , family values and positive attitude as reasons why they like to be his partner .
however , when the question is asked &quot; If not you , who should get W@@ oods &apos;s last rose ? , &quot; could their answers become a game @-@ destro@@ yer who won the heart of the bach@@ elor .
Je@@ av@@ ons Fel@@ lows and Mark@@ os@@ ki both quickly named both - except themselves - M@@ ack@@ ay as the best partner for Wood .
Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay and Sam Wood have had a simple relationship from the first day .
&quot; from the moment I entered the house and noticed ( Sarah &apos;s ) and S@@ ams energies , I felt that they were quite compatible and I thought that in the whole course of the show , &quot; said Je@@ av@@ on @-@ Fel@@ lows .
&quot; Sarah stands on the ground with both feet , it &apos;s so much fun to be together with her , &quot; Mark@@ os@@ ki added .
I have seen them together and they have the right chemistry .
they feel comfortable and comfortable with each other .
Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay thinks she and Sam Wood are well suited as pairs .
from her point of view , M@@ ack@@ ay said that the house visit made her clear last week that Wood &apos;s &quot; the One &quot; could be .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; once I saw him with my friends and family , it became clear to me that this is obviously not just a game - I &apos;m now un@@ reserv@@ edly on him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and when she was asked who wood should choose , if not she , she was en@@ ig@@ matic .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know if I can say that , &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I love the remaining girls equally - it &apos;s a draw between S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana and L@@ ana .
the Bachelor is broad@@ cast@@ ed on ten on Wednesday , 7 : 30 pm .

Jar@@ ry@@ d Hay@@ ne had several options to start his N@@ FL career .
Detroit and Seattle showed great interest after his move to the USA - and there were many other teams that sent requests for his impressive open training day at the end of last year .
but Hay@@ nes chose the San Francisco 49@@ ers and trainer Jim Tom@@ sul@@ a and it looks like a wise decision .
some trainers would have ban@@ ished Hay@@ nes for the rest of the game on the bench , as he lost a don@@ gle as it did the Aus@@ sie @-@ Ru@@ g@@ by League conver@@ sions at his first Pun@@ t return on Tuesday at 20 @-@ 3 victory against Minn@@ es@@ ota .
but Tom@@ sul@@ a trusted his husband and gave Hay@@ on the next opportunity for a pun@@ t return and also in the ongoing game after a violation of Reg@@ gie Bush .
Tom@@ sul@@ a continued to show his true face in the dressing room after the game .
instead of grinding his ro@@ ok@@ ies from the rest of the team through the mill , he encouraged them .
Tom@@ sul@@ a also strengthened Hay@@ nes in his press conference after the game .
the 49@@ ers Spor@@ ts@@ por@@ ter Cam In@@ man reported that Hay@@ nes was also encouraged by special team coordinator , Thomas Mc@@ Gau@@ gh@@ ey , who advised him to forget his scrat@@ ched catch and take care of the next game .
Jar@@ ry@@ d Hay@@ ne p@@ atz@@ t on a Pun@@ t , which was restored in the first game quarter of Minn@@ es@@ ota Vi@@ kings
it was certainly not the start that Hay@@ nes and his massive Australian followers had hoped for for his N@@ FL debut .
Hay@@ ne left after the f@@ um@@ ble flu@@ ently the playing field and later told the Australian radio Duo Ham@@ ish &amp; Andy on 2@@ Day@@ FM 10@@ 4.1 , that he couldn &apos;t imagine a worse start to his N@@ FL career ,
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was a thing that happens now , you just take care of the next game , and that &apos;s it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Hay@@ ne . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Hay@@ ne compared the Schn@@ itzer with his original debut at that time in 2007 , when a pass in his own in @-@ Go@@ al area led to a T@@ ry for Que@@ ens@@ land .
overall , it was a great experience for the 27 @-@ year @-@ old .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Free elec@@ tors are calling for the hi@@ ring of 1,000 new teachers in Bavaria for the high number of refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
party and group leader Hubert Ai@@ wan@@ ger at the beginning of the F@@ W fall retreat in Groß@@ stadt before a severe crisis at Bavaria &apos;s schools , if there are not correspon@@ dingly new teachers for the many new students : &quot; we need at least 1000 additional teachers in order to preserve the schools from collapse , &quot; said Ai@@ wan@@ ger .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; otherwise we will get distor@@ tions in the Bavarian education system . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Land@@ tag fraction of the Free elec@@ tors conven@@ es in the Fran@@ con@@ ian commune until Friday .
actually , quite different main themes were provided .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but the record number of refugees is now dominated by the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; free elec@@ torate &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course , the issue of asylum will over@@ lay the exam , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ai@@ wan@@ ger . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ai@@ wan@@ ger called for the establishment of UN Protection Are@@ as for Refu@@ ge@@ es in Syria , as was the case during the Yugoslavia in the n@@ ine@@ ties .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not going on , we must go to the causes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Free elec@@ torate . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; rejected asylum seekers want to push the free voters as soon as possible . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for this reason , Ai@@ wan@@ ger also demanded more staff for the administrative courts responsible for asylum law@@ suits : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we also need at least 50 new asylum seekers , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ai@@ wan@@ ger . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the F@@ W leader critic@@ ised that several federal states are not consistent : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need national standards of federal states nationwide . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; Bavaria sli@@ ps away , others don &apos;t . &quot;
&quot; we have to become more agile . &quot;
but the country politics in Groß@@ Wall@@ stadt is not supposed to fall under the table .
a long @-@ standing continuous torch remains on the agenda : the education policy .
for the new school year , Minister of Culture Ludwig Spa@@ en@@ le ( CS@@ U ) started the pilot study &quot; Mittel@@ stufe Deutsch &quot; at 47 high schools , in which an extension of the gymn@@ asi@@ um intermediate level will be tested for three to four years .
but Ai@@ wan@@ ger is not far enough .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the issue of G@@ 9 must be accelerated , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the F@@ W boss . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we demand freedom of choice for all high schools that want to . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
free travel at G@@ 9 wherever desired .

many of the stock markets reck@@ on that the markets will be on the spot until after the interest decision in the United States and also for the big decline on the stock exchange on this Friday .
the discussion around the loads from the nuclear phase has temporarily de@@ pressed the shares of RW@@ E and left deep marks even at E@@ on .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to &quot; Spiegel , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the German energy companies probably lack 30 billion euros of provisions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Federal Government denied the figures mentioned in the press .
the shares of the two largest German energy companies recovered slightly , but ultimately lost 3.3 percent ( RW@@ E ) and 6.@@ 15 percent ( E@@ on ) .
Infin@@ eon shares rose by another 3.@@ 22 percent at the D@@ ax peak .

the papers from the Daimler and BMW car manufacturers increased by 1.@@ 34 percent and 2.@@ 21 percent respectively .

the Con@@ federation Future lost 0.@@ 71 percent to 15@@ 4.@@ 11 points .
the course of the euro decreased in the afternoon to 1.@@ 12@@ 62 dollars .
at noon the European Central Bank set the reference rate on US $ 1.@@ 13@@ 05 ( 1.@@ 12@@ 68 ) .

4 people killed after polic@@ emen shoot gum@@ mates on demonstr@@ ators in Nepal
four people , among them a 4 @-@ year @-@ old boy , were killed in southern Nepal after the police shot tires in a crowd that demonstrated against the proposed new constitution , a civil servant said on Wednesday .
the violence broke out on Tuesday evening in the district Rup@@ an@@ deh@@ i , about 175 miles west of the capital Kathmandu .
B@@ ish@@ n@@ u Pr@@ as@@ ad D@@ ha@@ kal , senior officials , said that more than 1,000 demonstr@@ ators had gathered outside a police station , with some of them throwing stones and fire@@ bombs .
Mr D@@ ha@@ kal said that the police used tear gas and poured into the air before it res@@ or@@ ted to rubber bul@@ lets .
twenty polic@@ emen and five civilians were injured , he said .
it was not immediately clear why the used rubber bul@@ lets , known for being able to kill , which are traditionally used as a less fatal alternative , apparently produced such a high death rate .
the debate was the last in weeks of violent protests in Nepal &apos;s southern plains , where members of the ethnic group of the Mad@@ hes@@ i say that new provinces that are formed as part of the proposed new constitution would reduce their political influence .
there were also protests in the Western Nepal from the ethnic group of T@@ har@@ us who want their own state .
at least 40 people , including 11 police officers , have been in violent confron@@ tations since the 10th century .
in August , when the four major political parties signed an agreement to divide the country into provinces - an important step towards a new constitution , but a very controversial subject in Nepal , which has been governed centrally for centuries .
the work on a new constitution has been on its way since 2008 , but the leg@@ is@@ lators have accelerated the process after the devastating earthquake that killed thousands of people in April .
the leg@@ is@@ lators have voted this week on certain cl@@ auses in the constitutional draft in Kathmandu , and officials said that the new constitution could enter into force on Sunday .
construction site planned in the city
the land at the Em@@ den Youth Center Alte Post is to be rebuilt .
the city is currently preparing everything for the marketing of the 4000 sq@@ .@@ m. area .
a mixture of trade , commerce and housing is planned , but there are still no concrete offers .
Em@@ den - Em@@ den City wants to market around 4000 square meters of land in direct proximity to the youth centre Alte Post .
the preparations for this are currently underway .
the plan is to use the premises for a mixture of trade , commerce and housing .
you wait for appropriate offers , it is said by the city .
which investor comes into question is not yet clear .
no contracts have been concluded accordingly .
the city of Em@@ den had a part of the property located on the Ring@@ straße / corner of the street , already a few months ago bought and the building that was situated on it .
project H@@ ieve : details are on the table
the plans for the holiday residence on the Small Sea near Em@@ den take shape .
the investor made public plans for the project for the first time .
some residents are still worried - they fear the sale of their leisure
for months , behind closed doors had been negotiated , ag@@ itated , deb@@ ated and drawn .
now there are plans for a new holiday house near Em@@ den on the table .
the prospective client , the medium @-@ sized Em@@ press company &quot; System Construction , &quot; publicly presented his plans for the first time on Monday evening in the Em@@ den Council &apos;s urban development committee .
originally this point had been on the non @-@ public part of the agenda .
under the pressure of the project critics and the F@@ DP faction , who accused the investors and the administration of sec@@ rec@@ y , Ralf Be@@ hr@@ end@@ lessly moved from the system construction management to the offensive : &quot; we have not yet answered all questions , &quot; he said before the Council members and more than 50 visitors .
but it is good to be able to meet all the rum@@ ours now .
the roughly ten to twelve million euro project has been in discussion for months .
violent reactions among sea @-@ bu@@ d owners who had come to the meeting sum@@ mon@@ ed the pictures and new details of the hotel construction .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Roberto Schulz , Meer@@ bus@@ den@@ ier and member of the board of interests of the An@@ gli@@ eger , Pro H@@ ieve , compl@@ ains : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a giant cla@@ p that over@@ looks all the other buildings . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he also fears like many other project critics that traffic would increase dramatically due to the intended size of the system : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all buses must come to expect that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says Schulz &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
what happens exactly on the good one hect@@ are area of the former restaurant is still open .
there is no operator yet .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; only must we have a coherent concept , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ralf Be@@ hr@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
because this was still lacking , the construction plans are still variable .

Google launches dou@@ bling donation campaign to collect $ 11 million for refugees
Google Inc ( Goo@@ gl . O ) announced a double donation campaign to raise $ 11 million for humanitarian organizations that will help thousands of refugees fle@@ eing the European nations , as they flee from war torn and im@@ pover@@ ished countries .
Google has an un@@ usually personal approach to the announcement of the donation call on his blog .
instead of letting a manager make the announcement , Rita Mas@@ oud , a Google employee , who had fled with her family from Kab@@ ul , when she was seven years old , wrote about her personal experiences .
&quot; our journey included many dark train and bus trips , as well as hunger , thirst , cold and fear , &quot; she wrote .
I was lucky .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but as the refugee and migrants &apos; crisis has grown in Europe , many people like my family desper@@ ately look for help . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
donations go to four non @-@ profit organisations providing assistance to refugees and migrants : doctors Without Bor@@ ders , International Res@@ cue Committee , Save the Children and UN High Commissioner for Refu@@ ge@@ es .
Google said that the first globally collected donations up to a value of 5.5 million were doubled to goo@@ gle@@ .com / sub@@ due to 11 million dollars .
Europe is confronted with its worst refugee crisis since the Second World War , largely caused by the four @-@ year civil war in Syria , which has driven more than 4 million people this year .
many flee from the war crushed in Afghanistan , Yemen , Iraq and Libya .

&quot; the mortality data need a long time to show something , &quot; said Dr. Robin Black@@ stone , an expert in weight @-@ loss surgery , who wrote an editorial for the new study in J@@ AM@@ A Surgery .
weight loss surgery or obesity surgery , use various methods to reduce the size of the stomach .
they reduce hunger and limit the body &apos;s ability to absorb food .
over the years , obesity operations have proven effective in the treatment of type 2 diabetes , but most studies have been carried out in people who are obes@@ e with a Body Mass Index ( BM@@ I ) of 35 or above .
BM@@ I , a certain amount of weight in terms of size , is considered normal between 18.@@ 5 and 24.@@ 9 .
a BM@@ I of 25 or more shows that someone is overweight and people with a BM@@ I over 30 are considered to be obes@@ e .
you can calculate your BM@@ I here : 1.@@ us@@ a.@@ go@@ v / 1@@ D@@ 0@@ Z@@ q@@ D@@ v .
for the new study , the researchers from Tai@@ wan@@ an Min @-@ Sh@@ eng general hospital data , which they have collected in a study since 2007 , compare two types of obesity @-@ surgery - ga@@ stri@@ c b@@ ypass and ga@@ stri@@ c ul@@ c@@ ers - to medical treatments for type 2 diabetes in people who were slightly overweight .
the average BM@@ I below those undergoing this surgery dropped from 31 to 24.@@ 5 to the end of the fifth year in this study .
meanwhile , BM@@ I remained in those who received non @-@ surgical diabetes treatments roughly equal to 29 .
among those undergoing surgical intervention , 36 % of the diabetes was completely dissolved and 28 % in part .
in the medical @-@ treated group , compared to diabetes , diabetes was completely dissolved in only one percent and , in some cases , only about two percent .
in addition , the results of the controls of blood pressure , tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ des and &quot; bad &quot; L@@ DL cholesterol were generally better in the &quot; surgical &quot; group , &quot; the authors found out .
the researchers also monitored the blood glucose level of ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c , which reflects the blood sugar levels over time .
hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c is best kept under 7 percent , the researchers write .
after the operation , the average hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c decreased by around 9 percent to around 6 percent .
however , in the medical therapy group it remained stable at about 8 percent .
but this better &quot; gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic control &quot; - as reflected in the improved hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c level - did not reduce mortality in five years , so the leading researcher Dr. Chi@@ h @-@ Ch@@ eng H@@ su and his colleagues .
the research team also compared average results with the two types of surgery .
in the fifth year , the b@@ ypass surgery group had lost more weight in comparison to the host surgery group ( 18.@@ 7 vs. 14.@@ 2 kg ) , reaching greater decl@@ ines in BM@@ I ( 7.@@ 4 versus 5.1 ) and ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c ( 3.1 % vs. 2.1 % ) and reported rather a complete overcoming of diabetes ( 4@@ 6.@@ 9 % vs. 16.@@ 7 % ) .
while the new study shows no survival benefit of surgery after five years , there is evidence from a study of heavier people in Sweden that surgery leads to longer life , says Black@@ stone from the University of Arizona , College of Medicine Phoenix .
in the Swedish study it was about 29 percent less likely to die in the course of 15 years in obes@@ e people who underwent O@@ bes@@ ity surgery - compared to a group that tried conventional methods .
although the new study showed no advantage for survival in the surgery patients , Black@@ stone said it was cal@@ ming for people with a BM@@ I under 35 who are interested in the procedure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the critical point of this study because it says that this operation is lower in this lower BM@@ I group , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; without increased risk of death or kidney disease , she said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Black@@ stone added that people and their doctors should start taking weight seriously as soon as the patient lies with his BM@@ I between 27 and 30 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think we are waiting for too long to bring people to take this seriously , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think that once they have accumulated these genetic changes that have attached their bodies to obesity and diabetes , a revers@@ al is really difficult . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
love story plays in the H@@ uns@@ rück
it is a topic that is increasingly considered in fiction : a young woman , un@@ popular at school times and un@@ si@@ gh@@ tly , meets the s@@ warm of her youth after years , and she falls in love with her .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so even in the recent novel &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ac@@ tually we are not that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by Lu@@ isa Bin@@ der . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
beyond the love story , the novel should be interesting especially for H@@ uns@@ rück readers , because he plays in Lang@@ weiler and the surrounding villages .
the main professional writer grew up in Lang@@ weiler and is pleased that she could put a literary memorial to her hom@@ etown .
&quot; it is impossible that everyone can come to Europe &quot; - Dalai Lama - RT @-@ News
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Europe cannot take all the refugees , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Dalai Lama and added that the real solution to the refugee crisis lies in the Middle East . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Tibetan Buddhist leader called for an end to violence in the home countries of the refugees .
the Dalai Lama promised the problem of the ongoing refugee crisis at the beginning of his ten @-@ day visit to the United Kingdom in his speech on the occasion of the opening of the Dalai Lama Centre for Com@@ passion in Oxford , which de@@ votes itself to ethics .
he demanded that under the given circumstances the interests of humanity should be put before the interests of the individual nations or even continents .
he also stressed that the reaction of Western European countries to the refugee crisis is ad@@ mira@@ ble , but the situation is not appropriate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is impossible that everyone can come to Europe , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in his speech . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
although the Dalai Lama praised Germany and Austria &apos;s efforts to cope with the crisis , he stressed that it was only a temporary solution .
&quot; to take care of several thousand refugees is wonderful , but in the meantime you have to think about long @-@ term solutions , such as real peace and genuine development , mainly through education , for which Muslim countries can be created , &quot; he stressed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ultimately , we need to think about how the killing will be reduced in their countries . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need to reduce the use of violence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the use of violence has never solved these problems , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he added . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Dalai Lama also addressed the problem of violence and commented on George Bush &apos;s actions after the terrorist attack of 11 September and turned out that the violent reaction of the US dra@@ gged out a chain of un@@ controll@@ able events .
after September 11 , I expressed my con@@ dol@@ ences in a letter to President Bush , and I told him that the way to solve this problem lies in non@@ violence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I know his motives were good , but he put violence and that caused unexpected consequences , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Dalai Lama . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
four@@ fold increase of intake of disinf@@ ect@@ ant disinf@@ ect@@ ant by children over the last 4 years
poison control centers in the US report about an almost 400 percent increase in the number of children under 12 years who swal@@ low strong alcohol disinf@@ ect@@ ants , like Georgia Po@@ ison Center .
according to Dr. Gay@@ lord Lop@@ ez , Director of Georgia Po@@ ison Center , the cases of revenue from hand des@@ infection products in children under 12 years , the po@@ ison@@ ous control centres report , from 3,@@ 26@@ 6 in 2010 to 16.@@ 117 in 2014 .
&quot; children increasingly come to these products , and unfortunately a percentage of them are landing in the emergency room , &quot; said Lop@@ ez CN@@ N .
he said that some children have pur@@ pos@@ ely drink disinf@@ ect@@ ants while some do it to impress their friends or because of a mut@@ ation among the social media .
videos on YouTube show how young disinf@@ ect@@ ants drink only because of a cheap experience .
young people have supposedly mixed dis@@ infection products with low @-@ alcohol mou@@ th@@ wash in order to obtain a harder drink .
younger children can be attracted by attractive fragran@@ ces of disinf@@ ect@@ ants .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a child does not think that this is bad for it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Lop@@ ez . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
many of the more attractive ( hand san@@ iti@@ zing agents ) are those that are perf@@ um@@ ed .
there are disinf@@ ect@@ ants with straw@@ berry , grape and orange scent that are very appealing for children .
hand san@@ iti@@ zer contains somewhere between 45 and 95 percent alcohol .
very few sp@@ lashes can lead to alcohol in@@ toxic@@ ation especially in infants .
&quot; it is highly concentrated alcohol , &quot; told Dr. Stephen Thor@@ n@@ ton , medical director of the poison control centre at the University of K@@ ans@@ as , the station Fox 4 in K@@ ansa City .
so , you would leave no si@@ p whis@@ ky around , but people leave this hand san@@ iti@@ zer within reach of children , and when children come to it , it is a quick way to consume a lot of alcohol .
N@@ ha@@ i@@ jah Rus@@ sell , a six @-@ year @-@ old girl , recently taken four sp@@ lashes of straw@@ berry @-@ sc@@ ented hanging disinf@@ ect@@ ant in school , was brought to treatment in an emergency .
her blood alcohol concentration was 17@@ 9 , twice higher than the threshold that has been legally in@@ toxic@@ ated by an adult , said Dr. Chris Rit@@ ch@@ ey , an emergency doctor who treated them in the G@@ winn@@ ett Medical Center outside Atlanta .
N@@ ha@@ i@@ jah l@@ ush@@ ed her words and was not able to go when she arrived in the emergency room .
doctors were watching over night in a separate children &apos;s hospital on signs of brain trauma , because the girl had fallen through the alcohol and hit her head , said Rit@@ ch@@ ey .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was very frigh@@ tening , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Or@@ vie@@ a Scott , N@@ ha@@ i@@ j@@ ahs &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; CN@@ N . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it could have been fatal for my child .
Lop@@ ez has recommended parents and teachers to use non @-@ alcoholic products or disinf@@ ect@@ ants and to store hands @-@ on disinf@@ ect@@ ants outside the reach of the child .
in addition to alcohol pois@@ oning , some disinf@@ ect@@ ants were associated with deaths .
in 2013 , two women died in Ontario , after the swal@@ lowing of disinf@@ ect@@ ants which contained a non @-@ declared ingredient .
employees of health authorities believe that the product contains meth@@ anol , a deadly solution rather than eth@@ yl alcohol , which was recorded as an active ingredient .
in January , three students of the fourth class in the State of New York planned to poison their &quot; common &quot; teacher by expos@@ ing anti@@ bacterial products around the classroom , &quot; reports a police report .
the teacher is highly allergic to anti@@ sep@@ tic disinf@@ ect@@ ants and ban@@ ished them from their room .
the police looked at the frozen plan as &quot; proj@@ ec@@ tile &quot; and referred to disciplinary action to the school authority .
Vil@@ lingen @-@ Schwen@@ n@@ ingen : three vehicles damaged
in case of a rear @-@ end collision , a 33 @-@ year @-@ old car driver had been slightly injured during a rear @-@ end collision .
a 60 @-@ year @-@ old truck driver drove to the industrial area on the cross @-@ p@@ lier and noticed too late that at the round@@ about two pre @-@ driving vehicles had stopped .
as a result , he hit the rear of an audi@@ ble with his truck and postpon@@ ed this vehicle to a previous Ford Fi@@ esta .

Griff@@ i@@ ths playing talk about di@@ shar@@ mon@@ y
there are rum@@ ours about di@@ shar@@ mon@@ y at Cel@@ tic Glas@@ gow , which was dismissed by Griff@@ i@@ ths spontaneously . he insi@@ sted that he and his team comrades are not under increased control as they prepare for confrontation with the Dutch leader .
I don &apos;t think we feel under pressure , I think the players are looking forward to it .
the lack of title competition in Scottish football bored Dutch - de Bo@@ er
former R@@ angers mid@@ fiel@@ der and former national player of the Netherlands Ron@@ ald de Bo@@ er said that Dutch football fans have lost interest in Cel@@ tic , there is no title ri@@ val@@ ry with the R@@ angers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; de Bo@@ er , currently an ambassador for Aj@@ ax , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Holland they do not show highlights of the Cel@@ tic Games and why ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is because the ran@@ gers are not there .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; people here are not just talking about the return of the ran@@ gers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they talk about the Old Fir@@ m .
they talk about both teams and that &apos;s what interests them .
there is a lot of tension in the Old @-@ Fir@@ m games , and there are not only the people in Scotland who want to see these games .
I will turn things around , swe@@ ars Dei@@ à .
Ron@@ ny Dei@@ la has accepted Cel@@ tic to fight but the Norwegian boss s@@ wore to turn things around .
after the defeat against Malm@@ ö and the subsequent departure from the Champions League , the defeat against 10 @-@ man from Aber@@ deen , which now stands at the top of the table with a five @-@ point lead .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but Dei@@ à said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Cel@@ tic had already bad times before , and we will come back . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
now we want to get out as soon as possible .
I know it &apos;s very frustr@@ ating and a lot of people are very , very angry or sad about what happens .
we feel it that way - but we must continue .
we really need to really support Cel@@ tic because that makes the players better .
standing together is so important .
War@@ bur@@ ton cau@@ ti@@ ously with January transfers
despite his comments just a few weeks ago , suggest@@ ing that he hur@@ ried a few January transfers , R@@ angers @-@ Bos@@ s Mark War@@ bur@@ ton is cau@@ tious at signing new entran@@ ts and insi@@ sts that he does not want to distur@@ b the unity of the I@@ bro@@ x cad@@ re .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; former CEO of Br@@ ent@@ ford said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the January transfer window is very different from the summer window . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the players coming in the summer have this pre @-@ season time to integrate what you have seen with our own group this season .
the team is really good .
sometimes more damage is caused by adding unnecessary players to what you really need .
Cel@@ tic target person Mich@@ u with reference notes
S@@ wan@@ sea @-@ Stür@@ mer Mich@@ u , with Cel@@ tic during the transfer period in conversation , has indicated that he can withdraw if his contract exp@@ ires at the Sw@@ ans .

the Hear@@ ts led 2 : 1 when Pat@@ er@@ son was sent from the field and then lost 3 : 2 , but the red card of the defender was later lifted - the third red card of Coll@@ um , which was rev@@ oked in eight months .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; N@@ eil@@ son stays what he said and insi@@ sts : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have not questioned integrity , I have not commented on performance . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

the incident occurred in a pub in the Ros@@ eb@@ urn area of Edinburgh in front of a Edinburgh Der@@ by in Ty@@ bad@@ ass in March 2014 .
&quot; it was a Der@@ by , and it was the heat of the moment , &quot; said the Stür@@ mer and added : &quot; it &apos;s safe to say that I don &apos;t return to Ty@@ nec@@ ast@@ le if it doesn &apos;t play for Cel@@ tic Glas@@ gow . &quot;
Ger@@ adi@@ ce Supervisory Board has confidence in Dun@@ dee United Management

I think Stephen Thom@@ p@@ son has confidence in us .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will return the boys to Tra@@ b , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Don@@ nel@@ ly . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mc@@ Inn@@ es said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is no team that has won everything , in poker games or le@@ agues , the games of that kind won &apos;t win . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
unemployment in Scotland remains unchanged , as it rises in the UK as a whole .
unemployment in Scotland remained unchanged from May to July at 16@@ 4,000 , while the number of people without work for the United Kingdom as a whole rose by 10,000 to 1.@@ 82 million during the same period .
Scotland &apos;s unemployment rate of 5.@@ 9 percent was over the U@@ K@@ s of 5.5 percent , as shown by the figures of the National Statisti@@ cal Office ( ON@@ S ) .
in the meantime , employment in Scotland fell by 12@@ ,000 during the three months , with the number of employees now at 2,@@ 6@@ 12@@ ,000 .
in the course of the quarter , the employment rate for Scotland dropped to 7@@ 4.0 percent - a number above the UK average of 7@@ 3.5 percent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Secretary of State for Scotland David Mund@@ ell commented on the latest figures and said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the government &apos;s long @-@ term plan laid the foundations for a stronger economy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is almost exactly one year that Scotland had made the historic decision to remain part of the United Kingdom .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in these 12 months we have experienced further improvements on the Scottish labour market with an increase in employment and a decline in unemployment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

why I witnessed an execution in O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma
a little later , except for a late legal intervention , I will see how a man is brought to death .
when it happens , and I hope that it doesn &apos;t happen , I will sit in a spect@@ ator gallery in the death chamber at the O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma State Pen@@ it@@ enti@@ ary when Richard Glos@@ si@@ p is executed by the poison sy@@ ringe .
he asked me to be one of the four official witnesses at his death .
the invitation was made for the first time in January about his best friend , and although I was shocked , I agreed .
when the day drew near , I began to fear .
so , why should I do it ?
I agreed because I thought it would be a good way to tell the whole story about the death penalty .
it would offer a unique perspective .
it is true that journalists are allowed to see exec@@ utions in the USA , and there are often more applications available than places available , a mac@@ ab@@ re lot@@ tery is held to decide who is elected .
O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma has reduced the number of media sites from 12 to five .
those who are chosen will see it emotion@@ less .
I can &apos;t do that .
I will sit next to Richard Gar@@ si@@ ps close friend , with whom I have developed my own relationship over the months with phone calls and a two and a half hours visit .
I like the guy .
we often laugh a lot when we speak .
the prison authorities say that I can &apos;t be a witness and a journalist , so I won &apos;t be allowed to take a not@@ ep@@ ad and a pen to record what I see .
I just have to try to remember all the details .
a journalist from O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma accused me of giving up my im@@ parti@@ ality on Twitter .
here is the lesson .
tell the story of the prisoner as he wants and you get access .
I compl@@ ained to her .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she admitted that she &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it could have been better to form@@ ulate , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but she still thinks it &apos;s wrong with what I &apos;m doing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Richard Glos@@ si@@ p had a problem with some of the things I have said and written .
he doesn &apos;t tell me what I have to write , and I wouldn &apos;t do it even if he would .
I told him that he can remove me from his list of witnesses at any time .
but he wants an international repor@@ ter to be present to write there .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when he dies , he thinks that the public relations work will help the movement against the death penalty . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Kim Bell@@ ware , a repor@@ ter of the Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post , will sit next to me .
if you want to know more about the case , please listen to the series of pod@@ casts I &apos;ve made .
I don &apos;t want to mention here again .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I can &apos;t say with certainty that Richard Glos@@ si@@ p is innocent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his actions after the assass@@ ination of Barry Van Tre@@ ese would make him guilty of being a bene@@ fici@@ ary of action .
but I believe that there is a strong chance that he is not guilty of murder .
I believe there is not enough evidence to justify a death sentence .
I think his execution is wrong .
and from this perspective I will see him dying .
I cannot claim to be really objective .
there will be other repor@@ ters you can contact .
what you will get from me is what it means to see a man die of unnecessary death .

Peter M@@ oo@@ dy claims that ste@@ wards from Racing Victoria tried to install a spy in his st@@ ables last year and threatened to finish the race immediately .
he focused on the ste@@ wards and the integrity section of Racing Victoria and claimed that they conducted a personal campaign against him with the L@@ ate S@@ cr@@ at@@ ching of Lady Tat@@ i because of a race day treatment , the last straw on Wednesday .
M@@ oo@@ dy told Fair@@ fax Media that he always tried to do what is best for racing and he found himself under difficult conditions when it comes to the positive Cob@@ alt @-@ T@@ up@@ er test at Li@@ dar@@ is , which he cannot explain .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he held back 18 months for the es@@ pion@@ age accus@@ ations and did not want it to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; look like excessive grapes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I had nothing to say about it and I sat on it for a long time , but sometimes you &apos;re so frustr@@ ated that everything comes out at once , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; M@@ oo@@ dy said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they know that it continued .
sometimes you react and you have to live with the consequences and I have to live with what I have said .
I will go home tonight and sleep well .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I want to walk around the head and I want my owners to think that I am trying my best for them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if they start thinking , I don &apos;t do that , then I should not be a trainer .
I have to think about what I do with my license .
previously M@@ oo@@ dy had allowed the bomb to go up in an interview with rac@@ ing.com that the integrity department had tried to spy on his stall .
&quot; eigh@@ teen months ago Ter@@ ry B@@ ail@@ ey , Day@@ le Brown and Dr. Brian Ste@@ wart were sitting in a room with a man - whom I will name when asked - and offered him a job in my st@@ ables to provide information about what I do within my st@@ ables , &quot; said M@@ oo@@ dy on rac@@ ing.com .
they apparently believe that I am a dec@@ eiver .
if that is the case , they should certainly touch their n@@ oses , because they failed in trying to touch me .
Robert Rou@@ l@@ ston , former Chairman of the R@@ V@@ L , David M@@ oo@@ die , President of the R@@ V@@ L and Bernard Sa@@ undry , current CEO of R@@ V@@ L , were aware of this at the time and are still today .
should this bring me to the point that it is going to be personally ?
does the R@@ V@@ L conduct cow@@ ard@@ ly and perhaps make people outside of trainers responsible for what &apos;s going on in the industry ?
am I bad for the industry ?
am I so bad for the industry ?
maybe people think outside that I am .
maybe they have to take my license and drive me out , and I have no doubt that what I say is letting them think about it now .
but I am now at the point where it doesn &apos;t matter , and that makes me sad .
that makes me really sad .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I will ex@@ ert pressure on them and urge them to make a decision . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I have the support of my family and I can go .
the trainer &apos;s fru@@ stration levels have been based on the long @-@ lasting cob@@ alt scan at Li@@ dar@@ i , and L@@ ate S@@ cr@@ at@@ ching said he could &quot; throw his license over the table . &quot;
M@@ oo@@ dy , best known for his preparation of the un@@ folded Black C@@ avi@@ ar Master , described the race @-@ day treatment rule &quot; ridi@@ culous , &quot; after a pack of mud or clay was applied to the horse debate , which pushed against the rules .
&quot; it is against the rules of racing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have to take full responsibility for this , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; one of my colleagues mistakenly uses mud on my leg .
it could have been so yesterday evening .
it could have been so yesterday all the day , which was so .
but it was also the same on the day of the race .
M@@ oo@@ dy could be confronted with a three @-@ month dis@@ qualification for the treatment with the package on the race day . an investigation of this issue has been opened .
it is a joke .
people who set up these rules know nothing about the horse .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we all see that we need rules , but here you have too far , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said M@@ oo@@ dy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
man arrested after driver &apos;s flight
on the weekend , the police arrested a man after a collision with a cycl@@ ist and a driver &apos;s flight in Cob@@ ram .
the cycl@@ ist was delivered with a helicopter to the Royal Melbourne hospital with serious injuries after being hit by a car on Saturday morning on the Mur@@ ray @-@ Valley Highway .
the police said that the driver drove further without stopping to help the injured driver .
on Monday , a 50 @-@ year old man from N@@ ath@@ alia joined the police in Sh@@ ep@@ part@@ on .
it is expected to be indic@@ ted for driver &apos;s flight and ai@@ ded assistance and other traffic off@@ ences .

Melbourne @-@ Storm @-@ Trainer Cra@@ ig Bell@@ amy to fight against ri@@ vals because of conten@@ tions about ring fighting
Melbourne @-@ Storm @-@ Trainer Cra@@ ig Bell@@ amy has described criticism of the Tac@@ kling of his players as &quot; Agenda @-@ Set@@ ting &quot; of two Premier League favour@@ ites of the N@@ R@@ L .
Sydney R@@ oo@@ ster Trainer Tr@@ ent Robinson said that the refer@@ ees have allowed the Storm players &quot; ring fighting &quot; with his team during the high Storm victory in Sydney on Friday evening .
Bris@@ ban@@ e Bron@@ cos Trainer Way@@ ne B@@ enn@@ ett made a hardly concealed re@@ mark on the Storm Team after his team had achieved the final victory against North Que@@ ens@@ land cow@@ boys on Saturday night . he called the game a &quot; model example &quot; of the Ru@@ g@@ by League and said that the two from Que@@ ens@@ land were not &quot; too good &quot; in the struggle .
Bell@@ amy champi@@ oned the fli@@ ck@@ ering of his team and said that she was only focused on her &quot; contact . &quot;
Bell@@ amy added that the cri@@ tique of two leading trainers in his team was confident that they were worried about being struck by the Storm Team .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have not heard that Tr@@ ent Robinson said about ring fights when they beat us 24 : 2 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bell@@ amy on Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I can guarantee that we have not changed our def@@ en@@ sive system or techniques all year long . but in the last six weeks we have made contact with Tac@@ kles a real focus , and this has provided us with a trend revers@@ al .
Tr@@ ent has been there for three years and obviously he has a great team to train . so he is probably not used to losing , so it was a bit of a shock for him .
it is strange already , as this always appears again at this time of the year .
Bell@@ amy has attacked B@@ enn@@ ett &apos;s idea of &quot; exciting football &quot; and reminded his ment@@ or that B@@ enn@@ etts St George Il@@ la@@ war@@ ra Dra@@ gons won the Premier League in 2010 with &quot; boring &quot; football .
Way@@ ne speaks of exciting football .
he compared his game on Saturday night with our Friday night and how exciting it was , &quot; said Bell@@ amy .
I remember that in 2010 St George was critici@@ zed as a boring team and Way@@ ne said he will take care of a divor@@ ce .
but now he has a team that can play and that we look as exciting , especially his young players at their speed .
this is the ball game you want to play when you have this kind of players .
he made this statement in 2010 , now he wants all his kind of soccer to play - not every team has two players like Anthony Mil@@ ford and Ben Hun@@ t , so they can play as they can .
I build stronger trust because they say these things because they are a bit worried about playing against us .
six weeks ago , they probably didn &apos;t think of us when it was about Big Games .
Bell@@ amy also pointed out that the game Storm against R@@ oo@@ ster achieved a higher result than the game Bron@@ cos against cow@@ boys .
the game of the Bron@@ cos was probably a good game , I haven &apos;t seen it yet , but what was the result ? 16 : 12 ?
our game was 20 : 18 , there were two further tests in our game , but is that an exciting game ?
or are p@@ auses and don &apos;t points any more exciting ?
for me , it &apos;s the game plans .
when they mention us , it means that we will arrive at them in a phase .
the Storm Team released on this weekend as they won the right to receive either North Que@@ ens@@ land Cow@@ boys or the C@@ ron@@ ul@@ la Sh@@ arks on the next Saturday night in the A@@ AM@@ I Park . ticket sales begin on the next Tuesday morning .
Ser@@ bier with 200,000 US $ deposit on drugs bill
a man who could possibly have a life @-@ long sentence , because of his attempt to come into the possession of 40 kilograms of co@@ ca@@ ine smu@@ g@@ gled to Que@@ ens@@ land , was released against a damage deposit of $ 200,000 .
Mark@@ o Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c , 29 , was one of the five men who were arrested last month after the federal police found 100 kg of the drug on the yacht Sol@@ ay , which came from South America via Van@@ u@@ at@@ u and placed in August in Co@@ om@@ era .
Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c was observed how he met his co @-@ accused in the marina during the morning and later in the Café Co@@ om@@ era Road@@ house , where the police found 40 kil@@ os of the drug in a Toyota echo .
despite a possibly life @-@ long sentence for attempting to possess a commercial amount of co@@ ca@@ ine , the lawyer of Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c argued that there was no evidence that he tried to own the whole lot and that in the café could have been a harmless reason .
the Supreme Court judge , Peter Flan@@ ag@@ an , was concerned about the danger of escape at Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c .
he has clear relations with Serbia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he often travels to Serbia , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he explained to the Court on Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in case of a complaint , he lied to the police about his place of residence .
Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c &apos;s mother and step@@ father had offered a security deposit of 200,000 dollars to achieve his release .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after reading the aff@@ ection@@ ate declarations of the two people , it is clear that the circulation of a security of 200,000 dollars is a real financial burden , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said judge Flan@@ ag@@ an . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but that alone will not suff@@ ice to prevent him from appearing , he warned .
Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c was released against caution , under the conditions that he gives off to his Australian and Serbian passport , reports to the police daily and is holding a cur@@ few from 18 : 00 @-@ 06 : 00 .
accident at A@@ 5 near Karlsruhe : driver &apos;s cab breaks apart
in case of a collision with three lor@@ ries on the motorway 5 near Karlsruhe a lor@@ ry driver was seriously injured on Tuesday evening .
two of the three trucks involved had bra@@ ked in front of a permanent construction site in the direction of Basel .
the third driver noticed it too late and tried in vain to turn left at the last moment , as the police informed .
the driver &apos;s cab is completely apart .
the driver was seriously injured in a hospital .
the A@@ 5 between Bru@@ chs@@ al and Karlsruhe @-@ Nord was completely closed for six hours until 2 pm .
a damage was incurred in the amount of 12@@ 2,000 euros .
St@@ ev@@ an Ho@@ gg used phone of girls to attract pa@@ ed@@ op@@ hil@@ es to send images
a ped@@ op@@ hil@@ er used the telephone of a 11 year old girl to demand images of child abuse .
St@@ ev@@ an Ho@@ gg took the girl &apos;s phone when she was asleep , log into an online mess@@ aging service , from which he received a number of un@@ scheduled pictures of children sent to him by another user .
the girl later woke up and discovered that the telephone was missing and found it in the hand of sleeping Ho@@ gg .
she saw it , found the conf@@ using messages and immediately al@@ armed her mother .
the police took care of it and saw the five images , then analyzed computers that were found under the address and discovered &quot; relevant &quot; Web searches that used terms for the search for in@@ decent images of children .
Ho@@ gg then claimed against the officials that he did it because it would lead to &quot; pa@@ ed@@ op@@ hil@@ es on the internet , &quot; and he &quot; pre@@ tended to be a polic@@ eman to sc@@ are her . &quot;
the prosec@@ utor E@@ ili@@ d@@ h Rober@@ ts@@ on told the Dun@@ dee Sh@@ eri@@ ff Court : &quot; he said it would be an ad@@ diction to be addic@@ ted to people .
he admitted that searching on the computer was done by him , but he said it was done because he wanted to be a polic@@ eman to frigh@@ ten pa@@ ed@@ ophi@@ le .
he was asked about his conversations with the unknown person who sent him the pictures and asked him to send more photos .
he said he did it to l@@ ure her .
he said that he was sick in the head when he drinks , and said he would then see pictures of rape and murder .
MS Rober@@ ts@@ on added : &quot; when the girl found the news on the phone she called her mother and was trem@@ bling and crying .
she also saw the in@@ decent images on the phone and confronted the defend@@ ants with it .
the girl was inter@@ viewed and said that the accused took computers and Pla@@ yst@@ ation to talk to girls who looked much younger than he .
Ho@@ gg , 23 , W@@ ard Road , Dun@@ dee , ple@@ aded guilty according to the indictment , in@@ decent images of children on 14 June last year to have viol@@ ated the conditions and did not appear before the court for a hearing on 24 March this year .
advoc@@ ate attorney Greg@@ or S@@ im asked Ho@@ gg not to appear in the register of sexual offen@@ ders , argu@@ ing that &quot; no significant sexual element &quot; could be found in his off@@ ence .
Sh@@ eri@@ ff Ali@@ st@@ air Car@@ mi@@ ch@@ ael postpon@@ ed the verdict until October in order to receive background reports on social work .
in this case Ho@@ gg was given a deposit , but was kept in custody because of hear@@ ings to other pending cases .
it was recorded before the date of judgment in the directory of sexual offen@@ ders .
slu@@ dge switches to small border cross@@ ings to Germany
more and more refugees are taken up outside the major control points at the German @-@ Austrian border .
many floo@@ d@@ gates were caused by fear of discovery and arrest of people at smaller border cross@@ ings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the Austrian side , a spokes@@ man of the Federal Police said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
more than 1000 refugees have been picked up along the river estu@@ ary Inn in Passa@@ u and Rot@@ tal @-@ Inn since Tuesday .
they had reached the German side by foot over bridges and du@@ st@@ les .
there they are received by Federal Police officers and forwarded to the registration .
in comparison to the start of the week on Wednesday , the Munich central station significantly exceeded the number of refugees .
around 700 people had arrived in the state capital alone until 8 : 00 , said a spokes@@ man in the morning .
after the re@@ introduction of controls on the German @-@ Austrian border on Tuesday , 17@@ 59 refugees had reached the city .
Stuttgart : extension of tropical storm &quot; Henry &quot; in the Sou@@ thwest
meteor@@ ologists warn of storm clouds in the southwest of Wednesday afternoon .
due to a low @-@ pressure area over Western Europe currents are currently floo@@ ding into the country , the German Weather Service ( DW@@ D ) in Stuttgart announced .
the powerful low was the footh@@ ills of the tropical storm &quot; Henry , &quot; which was pulled over the Atlantic in recent days from the Bermuda Islands .
storms and storms are expected in particular in Baden .
according to DW@@ D , even in the Black Forest , on the Sw@@ ab@@ ian Al@@ b and at the Boden@@ se@@ ein@@ reis with goats from 60 to 90 kilometers per hour , can be expected .
on Friday , the sun can be seen again for a longer time .
the crowd makes it : every two years the car manufacturers show their innovations at the IAA .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in 2015 , there is primarily a movement among the compact cars that are currently selling very well . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
cars from the compact class are currently in great demand : around 28.@@ 1 percent of new registr@@ ations were accounted for by the German Federal Office ( KBA ) alone in August on this segment .
this is also reflected at the IAA ( public back@@ stage from September 17 to 27 ) .
between all the futur@@ istic concept cars and new luxury cars and luxury cars , many new compact models will be presented this year .
one of the biggest premi@@ eres for the German car industry is the Opel Astra , which will be available at deal@@ er@@ ships in autumn .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Astra is an extremely important model for us , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Opel CEO Karl @-@ Thomas Neumann at the fair . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it belongs to the core of the brand .
in order for the volume model to be sold well , the new Astra is also not supposed to be much more expensive .
Opel launches an entry under the biggest competi@@ tor VW Golf , which starts at 17,@@ 650 euros .
the current Astra costs EUR 16 9@@ 90 .
the Astra is equipped with a new 1.4 @-@ liter engine with 74 kW / 100 hp .
moreover , Hessen has further diesel and gasoline engines of 70 kW / 95 hp to 147 kW / / 200 hp , which also includes three @-@ cylinder petrol engines for the first time .
unlike the major competitors VW Golf and Ford Focus , the Opel Astra is only a five @-@ door model .
the second variant will follow in the spring of the combination , which can be seen at the IAA .
and what will be added next to the Astra at the Frankfurt Motor Show ?
Renault Mé@@ gan@@ e : Renault is sending the fourth generation of his Astra &apos;s competi@@ tor Mé@@ gan@@ e to the race .
at the trade fair , the Mé@@ gan@@ e is to be seen exclusively as a five @-@ door in a conventional and an accentu@@ ated sporty GT @-@ version .
in the trade he comes next year , then also as a comb@@ i .
Infin@@ iti : completely new in the segment is Infin@@ iti Q@@ 30 .
the Nissan depos@@ itor wants to find his position in the rapidly growing segment with the new model .
the compact Infin@@ iti with its curved lines is fully integrated into the brand &apos;s design line .
the basic model will receive a petrol engine with an output of at least 90 kW / 122 hp .
the offer also includes a diesel with 80 kW / 109 hp or 125 kW / 170 hp .
Su@@ zu@@ ki Bal@@ eno : new in the segment is the Su@@ zu@@ ki Bal@@ eno , which is celebrating its world premiere in Frankfurt .
the model is offered with gasoline engines , including a newly developed 1.0 @-@ liter turbo@@ charged engine with an output of 82 kW / 111 hp .
the maximum torque is 170 New@@ ton@@ meters ( Nm ) according to manufacturer &apos;s instructions .
the sales launch of the Bal@@ eno in Europe is in spring 2016 .
Ds 4 : not entirely new , but completely renewed is the compact class DS 4 , which can be seen at the IAA .
the designers of the noble Cit@@ ro@@ ë@@ n se@@ wer kick @-@ off on the outside : here , the radiator grill was re@@ drawn and the changed head@@ lights were equipped with LED technology .
in the interior , the inf@@ otain@@ ment system was modernis@@ ed , the number of buttons lowered by a touch screen and integrated for the first time Apple Car@@ Play .
at the IAA in the compact class , there are also a number of re@@ visions and new variants such as the refurbished Mercedes A @-@ Class or the Peugeot 30@@ 8 G@@ TI .
J@@ VA Berlin Te@@ gel : five square meters of cell are un@@ worthy
the Federal Constitutional Court has given a right to an ex @-@ prisoner of the Judi@@ cial Pen@@ it@@ enti@@ ary in Justice , which was housed in a small cell for months .
because of the violation of human dignity , det@@ ain@@ ees are entitled to financial compensation if they are accommodated in small cells .
this decision was made by the Federal Constitutional Court in a decision published on Wednesday .
according to the judges , those affected could even hope for money if they were locked in confined spaces for a few days ( A@@ z . : 1 BvR 1@@ 127 / 14 ) .
thus an ex @-@ prisoner with his constitutional complaint was successful in Karlsruhe : he was housed in the Berlin @-@ Te@@ gel prison quarters between June and November 2009 in a single cell with around five square metres of floor space ; the toilet was spati@@ ally separated .
after this , the man , who is now on his free foot , has now been moved to a larger cell .
his office of office because of the un@@ worthy conditions of arrest against the Land Berlin failed .
however , the Constitutional Court raised the verdict of the Berlin Chamber Court and re@@ mitted the case to the trial .
they see the man &apos;s dignity injured .
chamber Court now decides on the amount of compensation
although for legal reasons only a few days of liability for the compensation were author@@ itative , a compensation claim was given , it was said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; otherwise , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a cl@@ ash of the privacy of the personality would be feared . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Chamber judgment must now clarify the amount of money compensation .
in the past , the constitutional judges have often strengthened the rights of prisoners of war .
thus they spoke only in April a prisoner of compensation , because he was incar@@ cer@@ ated naked in a cell .
according to a 2011 decision , the multiple allocation of a cell without separate toilet is un@@ worthy of human dignity .
in addition , on Wednesday , Karlsruhe also confirmed the Berlin Constitutional Court , which had an un@@ dig@@ ni@@ fied accommodation certified to a prisoner in a parallel case in November 2009 .
for three months , the former plain@@ ti@@ ff was lod@@ ged between 15 and 21 hours in a similar cell as in the Karlsruhe case .
the Berlin pris@@ ons had come to the head@@ lines in recent weeks also due to lack of staff .
prisoners are therefore always included 23 hours , which increases aggres@@ si@@ veness , even to ra@@ ckets it should have come because of the ten@@ se situation .
according to information from the Ministry of Justice 21 places in Te@@ gel are not occupied for young persons , 19 are to fall away in 2016 .
Angela Merkel and the refugee policy : &quot; we are creating this &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the immigration of refugees is an enormous challenge - the Chancellor is determined to accept her . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
what is coming to Germany ?
according to the Federal Ministry of the Interior , some 800 000 asylum seekers will come to Germany this year , according to Vice @-@ Chancellor Sig@@ mar Gabriel ( SPD ) , Germany is able to record a million refugees .
German Chancellor Angela Merkel ( CD@@ U ) demonstrated his determination in view of the unusual challenge : &quot; I say again and again : we can do this and we can do it . &quot;
what is coming to Germany gives the following overview .
according to various progn@@ oses between 350@@ 000 ( estimate of the Federal Ministry of the Construction ) and 400@@ ,000 ( estim@@ ation of the P@@ est@@ el Institute ) apartments are annually - and for the next five years .
this is almost twice as much as it is currently being built ( 250@@ 000 apartments ) .
the lack of housing is dramatic , but above all in affordable rental properties : every year 60@@ ,000 to 80@@ ,000 social housing projects fall out of the rental price , and these particularly favorable apartments will also apply to refugees .
Federal Minister Barbara Hend@@ ri@@ cks ( SPD ) wants to double the funding , from currently 5@@ 18 million to one billion euros .
much too little is this from the point of view of the P@@ est@@ el Institute : 80 000 social housing per year would have to be created and for this the Con@@ federation would have to invest in the amount of 6.@@ 4 billion a year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , scientists and federal mini@@ stries agree that there must also be more tax benefits in housing construction . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to estimates by the Institute for Employment Research , it is assumed that 55 per cent of the refugees in Germany can be employed in the long term .
however , in Germany , the refugees in Germany were not systematically asked for their qualifications to help them get started , as Claudia Walter , project manager for integration and education in the Ber@@ tel@@ smann Foundation , critic@@ ises .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but for the integration of refugees it is crucial whether they find work in Germany . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; work is the key to social contacts , for appreciation in the hold society , but also for the self @-@ esteem of immigrants , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says migration researcher Dietrich Er@@ hardt . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Germany , there has been a political turn@@ around in Germany : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from the prohibition of work for refugees to recognise jobs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
while there was a prohibition of work for asylum seekers of up to five years earlier , this was reduced to three months in November 2014 , as well as the residence obligation that restric@@ ts asylum seekers to a place of residence .
in society , too , due to the lack of skilled labour , a majority of the points of view prevailed that refugees should be able to gain access to the labour market faster .
a major hur@@ dle for access to the labour market is a lack of German knowledge .
up to now there is no adequate offer of general and professional language courses .
studies also show that workplaces are most often medi@@ ated through personal contacts .
the building of networks is therefore , according to Thr@@ es@@ hardt , the royal road to work integration .
the Berlin school administration has found that only a few fled parents give their children to Kit@@ as , an estimated ten to 15 percent : &quot; for the un@@ born parents it is only important to keep the family together , &quot; says Il@@ ja Ko@@ ha@@ bar , spokes@@ man for youth and family in the Berlin Senate Administration .
to convince the family nevertheless of the benefits of the K@@ ita , the management distri@@ butes hand@@ outs in different languages .
if the need for educ@@ ators increase strongly due to the large number of refugees , the Berlin Senate would try to increase training capacities - for instance by allowing more professional schools .
students without knowledge of German are prepared for classes in the countries .
however , they are not always taught by fully trained teachers , but , as in Berlin , also by teachers who have only one qualification in German as second language .
there is no shortage , says Be@@ ate &apos;s suit@@ case from the Berlin school administration .
the German Studenten@@ werk estimates that about 20 per cent of the refugees in Germany want to study .
in principle , no Bundes@@ land banned asylum seekers or tolerated the study - the only exception was Berlin , Interior sen@@ ator Frank Henkel ( CD@@ U ) has now given up its position .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Studi@@ ed willing refugees could be facilit@@ ated access to the university . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
because refugees with a reimbur@@ sement of resi@@ dences do not receive services according to the asylum application law more if they start studying .
in principle , the latter do not receive a B@@ af@@ ö@@ g , as they do not fall under the circle of the persons entitled to death .
tolerated refugees had to live in Germany for four years to be eligible for B@@ af@@ ö@@ g , from January 1 , 2016 , this span is shortened to 15 months .
but this funding gap must also be closed , for Steffen Kra@@ ch , Berlin &apos;s State Secretary for Science , and the German Studenten@@ werk .
students should immediately receive B@@ af@@ ö@@ g .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Islam will play a more important role in the future , as many refugees are Muslims , and for many , religion is an important part of their identity . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the state should gradually grant Islam the same rights as the churches have , and the existing state @-@ church law will continue to develop into a new state @-@ religion relationship .
it would also be important to establish an Islamic Wel@@ fare Association , who takes care of the newcom@@ ers in a professional manner .
rights also include duties .
in this way , the representatives of Islam must agree on clear contact persons and be prepared to work with the state in many areas and grant him certain control options .
this also includes the willingness to take heed to religious fundament@@ alism .
the Chairman of the Central Council of Muslims , A@@ im@@ an Maz@@ ye@@ k , expressed concern on Thursday that religious conflicts could also be carried into Germany .
those who wanted to ex@@ ert such conflicts in Germany immediately &quot; have their right to stay here , in Germany , &quot; he said in Bay@@ erischer Rundfunk .
he proposed transl@@ ating the Basic Law in Arabic .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; integration will hen@@ ce@@ forth be much more than today a topic of the whole society . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this will also change the majority society , and the reduction of discrimination and rac@@ ism will be more urgent .
Germany - as a result of European decisions - has been an anti @-@ discrimination agency and a general equality law for a decade .
but it is very slow to learn how the NS@@ U @-@ murder series showed , in the police and authorities , systematically ignored the rac@@ ist motive .
equal opportunities for all : what migrants organisations and the interest groups of non @-@ white Germans require for a long time and require international agreements such as the anti @-@ rac@@ ism convention in Germany must become a reality in the coming years if the country remains peaceful and its citizens want to use its opportunities - for the benefit of all .
in general , Germany is able to provide medical care to the previously expected refugees , says President Frank Ulrich Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; regarding man@@ - power and capacities , we create it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said to the Tages@@ spiegel . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , additional money must be poured into the system .
in order to avoid bott@@ len@@ ecks , Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery demands to be handed over to all the newcom@@ ers immediately in the registration of health cards .
achievements rendered could later be accounted for by the federal states .
and in the long run it is highly question@@ able to leave as many people as possible with the limited service catalogue , which the asylum application law fores@@ ees .
apart from that , the doctors mainly do the language barriers .
so far , the Berlin health scientist The@@ a Bor@@ de has proven that migrants are becoming less aware of their diseases than other patients .
not only in clinics , but also in medical practices , interpretation costs would require them to be taken over .
many refugees would also be helped by more general medical centres in emergency ambul@@ ances .
and with another diagnostic view .
among refugee children , for example , there are clearly more untreated disabilities , and among the young people it is about HIV education .
with the partly different clinical pictures , German doctors come from their education , but it is clear that Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery believes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the paras@@ ite attack or tuber@@ cu@@ lo@@ sis is not so difficult to detect &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Syrians had a highly developed education system ; several refugees were even physicians .
in order to be allowed to practice , they would have to prove their qualifications and possibly take ex@@ ams .
at least half of the refugees arriving in Germany are mentally ill according to estimates by the Bundes@@ Psycho@@ therap@@ e@@ ut@@ enk@@ ammer ( B@@ P@@ t@@ K ) : most of them suffer from a post @-@ trau@@ matic stress disorder or depression .
the refugee children are particularly vulnerable , says Dietrich Mun@@ z , President of the B@@ P@@ t@@ K .
a recently published study by the Technical University of Munich proves that every fifth Syrian refugee population is trau@@ mati@@ zed in Germany .
those who suffer from a post @-@ trau@@ matic stress disorder will suffer , among other things , to so @-@ called flash@@ backs with short@@ ness of breath , gi@@ dd@@ iness , heart@@ breaking and death sc@@ aff@@ olds .
other symptoms include sleep and concentration problems , strong fears and emotional num@@ b@@ ness .
in order to prevent the symptoms from becoming chronic , early treatment is necessary , Mun@@ z explained .
to date , however , only four percent of the mentally ill refugees receive psycho@@ therapy .
although psych@@ ologically ill asylum seekers in the social institutions can provide an application for psycho@@ therapy , the treatment usually lasts for several months .
in addition , in the social offices mostly non @-@ skilled workers or doctors who are not trained for mental illnesses will decide whether treatment is necessary or not .
this often leads to mis@@ calculations , says Mun@@ z .
Man@@ ege invites you to dream
with the new production &quot; Passion , &quot; the Cir@@ cus Pro@@ bst looks back on the traditions of cir@@ cus art .
the aim is to fascin@@ ate each age group in the fascination of fascinating ac@@ rob@@ atics , animal dres@@ sage and unique entertainment .
now the Cir@@ cus Pro@@ bst looks into the man@@ ege on the brick @-@ wipe to dream .
&quot; our passion is the cir@@ cus . &quot;
&quot; I can &apos;t imagine living without my cir@@ cus family , &quot; says Steph@@ anie Pro@@ bst , animal teacher and junior minister .
&quot; passion &quot; - under this motto is the current management of man@@ e@@ gen@@ itali@@ zation .
for more than 33 years , the cir@@ cus has been in the hands of the Pro@@ bst family .
the gift for enthusiasts is therefore in the blood .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is important for us to take people away from their everyday lives and take them in a completely different world for two hours , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stresses the 27 @-@ year @-@ old junior chef . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Man@@ e@@ gen@@ cocktail with a cosm@@ opol@@ itan flair , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says director Reinhard Pro@@ bst . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
50 cities on the almost 3 000 @-@ kilometre @-@ long tour can now experience this flair .
the program of the cir@@ cus impres@@ ses with talented artists from around the world .
awarded at the international cir@@ cus festival in Monte Carlo , the Russian St@@ oli@@ aro@@ v C@@ lown Family captiv@@ ates the audience with wit and charm .
the Cas@@ tillo Brothers also understand their craft .
with the heroes of the silent films the Cuban duo wants to take up loos@@ ely .
light@@ ness and ag@@ ility - with these words they identify themselves .
her humor@@ ous art on the mast is meant to win women &apos;s hearts in a storm .
apart from numerous salmon sal@@ ves , the ac@@ rob@@ atics of Cir@@ cus Pro@@ bst also fascin@@ ates with finger tip and articul@@ ation .
to balance with the unic@@ ycle on a ball ?
no problem for He Yu@@ an .
Ser@@ p@@ ent people are fascinating and frigh@@ tened at the same time .
W@@ ang L@@ in from China is familiar with the oldest form of ac@@ rob@@ atics , like little others and fascin@@ ates with her mobility .
sixty employees from twelve nations offer variety in every respect .
&quot; the animals belong to our family , &quot; stresses Steph@@ an@@ ies Mother , Brigitte Pro@@ bst .
ab@@ uses in the attitude of cir@@ cus animals are only too often subject to different animal welfare organisations .
Steph@@ anie Pro@@ bst looks at this : &quot; it &apos;s not good for our animals , we don &apos;t feel good either . &quot;
about 80 animals from five different continents enjoy each string unit .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; four @-@ leg@@ ged artists &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; as they are called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we want to work with the animals and have fun with them .
if the animal does not feel well , it does not want to enter the man@@ ege .
so the highest command is good for the animals .
the Pro@@ bst family is proud of their zeb@@ roid jum@@ bo , a mixture of a Sh@@ et@@ land@@ Pon@@ y@@ h@@ eng@@ st and a zeb@@ ra mare .
the two animals lived together eight years in an enclosure and nothing happened .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but then , suddenly , our little jum@@ bo was there , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Brigitte Pro@@ bst . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the zeb@@ roid is not ready for the man@@ ege , but it is the unique mas@@ cot of Cir@@ cus Pro@@ bst .
there should be something for every visitor .
&quot; one thing is certain , &quot; says Steph@@ anie Pro@@ bst : &quot; no matter if five or 1 200 people , we always give our best and are with all your heart . &quot;
the Cir@@ cus Pro@@ bst looks at his performances from September 17 @-@ 20 daily at 17 and 20 o &apos;clock .
on Sunday the program starts at 11 a.m. and 4 p.m .
Thursday is a family day , the prices are reduced by 17 o &apos;clock .
in addition , every day , the Ti@@ ersch@@ au is open from 10 am to 6 pm .
Zimbabwe &apos;s Robert Mu@@ gabe holds false speech in parliament
Mr Mu@@ gabe , Africa &apos;s oldest leader , desc@@ ended from a podium by a podium at the beginning of the year .
he remained un@@ har@@ med , but the video of the case spread quickly across the social media .
the Parliament &apos;s opening was also clou@@ ded by alleg@@ ations of members of the opposition that they would have received anonymous death threats and warned them to accompany Mr Mu@@ gabe &apos;s address with Bu@@ hr@@ ufen as well .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; last month they had bled him and interrupted him during his speech to the State of the Nation - this is the speech he repeated on Tuesday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Spe@@ aker of the Movement for Democratic Change ( M@@ DC ) In@@ no@@ cent Gon@@ ese said that seven opposition politicians have received text messages on their phones that warned them to dis@@ rupt Mr. Mu@@ gabe &apos;s address .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the message comes from a number that is not shown , but it has the title &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; death &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he told journalists to Mu@@ gabe . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she warns the Parliament members concerned that immunity will end in parliament and as soon as they leave Parliament , their parliamentary immunity is no longer effective . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Chief Executive Officer said that the party led by Morgan T@@ s@@ van@@ gi@@ ra@@ i is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; concerned &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; about the dangers for politicians . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Hewlett @-@ Packard will disman@@ tle up to 30,000 jobs
Hewlett @-@ Packard is expected to disman@@ tle 25,000 to 30,000 jobs within the framework of restructuring and savings efforts in the company &apos;s services .
later this year , HP will split into two listed companies and separate the computer and printer business from its fast @-@ growing company hardware and its service activities .
the expected job reduction will lead to a burden of more than 2.7 billion dollars from the fourth quarter , &quot; said HP in an explanation .
&quot; these restructuring measures will enable a more competitive and more sustainable cost structure for the new Hewlett @-@ Packard @-@ Enterprise , &quot; said Me@@ g Whit@@ man , HP President and Chief Executive , who will lead the division after the separation .
&quot; Hewlett Packard Enterprise will be smaller and stronger than HP is today , and we have a broad and deep@@ ened portfolio of businesses that support companies in the transition to a new style of business , &quot; Whit@@ man said .
as an independent company , we are better positioned than ever before to satisfy the changing needs of our customers around the world .
Hewlett Packard Enterprise has more than $ 50 billion annual sales and &quot; will be focused on providing previously un@@ paralleled , integrated technology solutions for businesses , &quot; explains the company .
it divi@@ des a company that was founded in the 19@@ 30s by the graduates of Stan@@ ford University Bill Hewlett and Dave Packard in order to establish electrical systems and whose Pal@@ o Alto garage one has called the birth place of Si@@ licon Valley .
HP has undergone a massive restructuring to handle the aband@@ on@@ ment of traditional PCs to mobile devices .
the measure of HP , the world &apos;s second @-@ largest PC manufacturer and one of the largest U.S. tech companies , is the latest in this area , based on the belief that tightly focused companies perform better performance .
FC Arsen@@ al @-@ Captain Mik@@ el Art@@ eta says that te@@ amm@@ ers must stand before the game against Dynam@@ o Zagreb behind the injured Jack Wil@@ sh@@ ere
Wen@@ ger emphas@@ ised Wil@@ sh@@ ere that it was only September and if his rehabilitation is according to plan , there is no reason why he cannot play again before Christmas .
this optim@@ istic scenario already means that Wil@@ sh@@ ere will surely miss at least the next four games for England , and in view of its history , his involvement in the next summer on the European Championship is certainly uncertain .
the big shame in this current problem is that Wil@@ sh@@ ere had ended the last season after a separate ank@@ le injury and then returned to his old momentum during the pre @-@ season .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this kind of injury does not thre@@ aten the career , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wen@@ ger . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is a bone that didn &apos;t heal well .
this is not a major issue .
this was just an accident .
it was not in connection with his an@@ kles , or with the injuries he had previously .
this may be true from a purely medical point of view , but as Wen@@ ger acknow@@ le@@ dges , there is the associated danger of further injuries , always when a player tries to return in the middle of the season .
it also develops an unpleasant pattern .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the investigation of Premier Inj@@ uries Ltd has recorded 23 different diseases of Wil@@ sh@@ ere since its debut six years ago . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he also played in just 65 of Arsen@@ al &apos;s 157 league games in the last five seasons .
the broader picture for Arsen@@ al is that they were one of the two Premier League clubs in six out of eight playing times since 2007 / 08 .
Wen@@ ger accepts the potential of a vi@@ cious circle , but arsen@@ al believes that an improvement in the injury rate will last during the last season .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sometimes when you come back from an injury you have a due time period , a time in which you need to strengthen your body and win strength , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wen@@ ger said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Jack is young enough to overcome that .
I hope his body stabili@@ zes , I am confident that he will do it and he will go through a career of the kind he deserves .
Arsen@@ al starts his Champions League season on Wednesday evening against Din@@ amo Zagreb in front of the games against Chelsea on Saturday and against Tot@@ ten@@ ham Hot@@ spur on Wednesday , and Wen@@ ger introduces himself a rotation within the team .
H@@ é@@ c@@ tor Bell@@ er@@ ín and Aaron Ram@@ sey have not travelled to Croatia , which means Ma@@ th@@ ie@@ u Deb@@ u@@ chy and Art@@ eta should start .
Wen@@ ger can also start with K@@ ier@@ an Gib@@ bs and Oli@@ vier Gi@@ rou@@ d instead of Nach@@ o Mon@@ real and The@@ o Wal@@ cot@@ t .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I try to keep balance and allow the players who need it to take a little break , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wen@@ ger said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
although arsen@@ al is clear favor@@ ites to pass through group F , the Mak@@ si@@ mir Stadium in Zagreb belongs to the play@@ grounds with the biggest in@@ timi@@ dation effect in Europe .
dynam@@ o is also unbe@@ aten after 41 games after the &quot; inv@@ inci@@ ble &quot; campaign was launched in the last season .
the stadium was shaken by an earthquake on Tuesday evening , measuring 3,@@ 2 on the Richter scale .
this year it was the 10th in Zagreb .
Wen@@ ger believes that arsen@@ al has drawn up the lesson from the past season with the Champions League capit@@ ulation against Monaco and is driven by the hope that his management will lead the association to his first European Cup triumph .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this drive is immense , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wen@@ ger . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it has never worked in arsen@@ al .
we were very close in 2006 , but on the other hand I &apos;m long enough in business to be realistic .
we are ambitious , but we are not dre@@ am@@ ers .
friendship Fest : the comedy show that gives us serious lessons about men &apos;s friend@@ ships
the lack of similar representations in shows is obvious , especially with regard to how the need for men to open up , now more desperate than ever has become , as suicide rates among young men on a 15 @-@ year high prove .
in 2013 , it was the most important cause of death in men aged 20 to 45 in Great Britain , and it remains three times more common in men than in women .
in an effort to address the problem , the Camp@@ aig@@ n Against Living Mis@@ er@@ one ( Cal@@ m - Camp@@ aig@@ n against a pi@@ tiful life ) announced in 2015 as the year of the man with the aim of questioning the culture that prevents men from looking for help if they need them .
friendship is the heart of the struggle to overcome this challenge .
a recent study involving more than 2,000 high @-@ school students with depres@@ sive symptoms noted that if the suff@@ erer had a sufficiently high percentage of friends with &quot; healthy mood , &quot; his chances of recovery doubled .
for those who are not de@@ pressed , a circle of mentally healthy friends hal@@ ves the risks of mental problems .
but of course you have to have friends first , so that friendship can work .
in the age of communication , guided by social media , with emphasis on the style of substance , the immedi@@ acy of the answer is often more important than an important contact .
our digital life has doubled the need to appear strong , fun and successful , even though in reality the isolation is dominant .
this superficial success is dominated by what psych@@ ologists call ex@@ trin@@ sic values ; money , image , social status , all at the expense of in@@ trin@@ sic values - our inner longing for personal development and friendship , which affects our spiritual health far more deeply .
and as a video game invent@@ or and billi@@ on@@ aire recently declared money can really not buy happiness .
the beauty of friends was that this focus was put on my head .
each character was not defined by his work , but by his personality , which sh@@ one through interaction as a friend .
the humour of Jo@@ ey and Ch@@ and@@ ler &apos;s frequent hu@@ gs , moments when playing football in comfortable arm@@ chairs and the desire of Ross to Rachel - all this came from the knowledge that men can definitely relate to it , even if they often go back to fully explore their feelings .
as an employee of the telep@@ hon@@ y ministry explained to me : ... &quot; my listening role for people who feel de@@ pressed and at risk of suicide has really shown me how even the smallest interactions of friends can make a difference . &quot;
the men who contact us often don &apos;t feel able to talk to friends .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the old saying &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am cop@@ ing with it &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has an enormous impact , such as the feeling that it is perceived as a weakness if you speak openly about problems . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
friends is one of the shows that comes to mind when I try to offer long @-@ term cop@@ ing mechanisms .
it clearly presents the little moments of male friend@@ ships .
so much my objective out@@ sider status about the phone may also help people in moments of despair , the long term support comes from a personal network of family and friends .
and so , if you visit Com@@ edy Central Friend@@ s@@ Fest this weekend with the completely re@@ designed backdrop to celebrate the day , why not take your friends for a drink in Central Per@@ k .
or , even better , if you see someone sitting in Star@@ bu@@ cks alone , give him a smile and say hello .
you never know what difference your friendship could make .
friends will be sent to Com@@ edy Central from beginning to end - all 2@@ 36 episodes - for # Friend@@ s@@ Fest
Maria meets to help PS@@ G to mal@@ ine Malm@@ ö
angel Di Maria celebrates with Bla@@ ise Mat@@ u@@ id@@ i and Ed@@ bauer Cav@@ ani after his match against Malm@@ ö .
di Maria makes his debut in the Champions League on Tuesday and helps PS@@ G to pass to Malm@@ ö .
here are the games report and the reaction to the game .
angel Di Maria and Ed@@ bauer Cav@@ ani took course when Paris Saint @-@ Ger@@ main started his Champions League season with an extremely comfortable 2 @-@ 0 victory against Malm@@ ö in the Prin@@ zen@@ park@@ sta@@ dion on Tuesday .
di Maria scored less than four minutes after the start of his Champions League debut as PS@@ G player , who brought the French master to the way , but after that they missed a number of opportunities before they finally increased their lead when Cav@@ ani achieved a head coach in the 6@@ 1st minute .
with Real Madrid and Sha@@ t@@ j@@ or Don@@ et@@ sk also in group A , Paris needs a strong start against the Swedish master , because they are not only striving for the kno@@ ck@@ out for the kno@@ ck@@ out kno@@ ck@@ out but an improvement on the way to the quarter fin@@ als in each of the last three campaigns .
but as they got the points , it was not a classic game by Laurent Blan@@ cs Team with Z@@ lat@@ an I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c missed opportunities in front of the gate . he was later replaced in the game against his home town team and against the association with which he began his illustri@@ ous career already in 1999 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s not easy to win at home or abroad in the Champions League . therefore , it &apos;s a good start to challenge our opponents and look relaxed even if there are certain things that we have to perfect during the season , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; this is a good sign .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we wanted to win and we won , although I regret that we didn &apos;t have one or two other gates . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c returned after his injury in one of three changes to the Paris team , which last weekend a 2 : 2 draw on his own place against Bordeaux in the First League , but he was stab@@ bed by Di Maria in the fourth minute .
the Argent@@ ine@@ an wing stor@@ mer was called the man who can take PS@@ G to the next level in Europe when he was taken over in the last month of Manchester United , and he indicated why when he ran into Marco Ver@@ rat@@ tis pass behind the Malm@@ ö Defense , before he passed Johan Wil@@ and into the long corner of the grid .
but if someone believed that PS@@ G would achieve a great victory , he was disappointed .
Malm@@ ö , who hit Cel@@ tic in a play @-@ off to achieve this level , joined the field at An@@ pi@@ ff with nine national players and was with a five @-@ man defense and two deep in the middle field str@@ ung a heavy opponent .
but apart from a shot by Nikol@@ a D@@ jur@@ d@@ j@@ ic , who passed far to Kevin Tra@@ pps &apos;s pole in the 3@@ 4th minute , they offered little in the attack .
instead , PS@@ G himself sometimes gave himself up , with some mis@@ ses and bad connections , not least of I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c , who dropped in the first half alone in the first half and then abandoned after Cav@@ ani had used it after re@@ bo@@ oting .
nevertheless he proved much more skill when he brought his fellow players into the game , and it was a pass from I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c , which Di Maria turned into a shooting which was passed by Wil@@ and in the 5@@ 2nd minute on the pole ...
the second gate finally fell short after the hours mark thanks to Cav@@ ani . the Urugu@@ ay@@ an thus achieved its sixth season tor after I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c had caught a left flan@@ k of Max@@ well .
that ended all the thoughts that Malm@@ ö could return to the game , and only an excellent grip by Wil@@ and from the shortest distance to stop David Lu@@ iz could keep the end result low before replacement players E@@ z@@ equi@@ el Lav@@ e@@ zzi finished a gate at the end .
the coach of Malm@@ ö , Age Har@@ ei@@ de , later admitted that PS@@ G played a class on his team , and the Norwegian said : &quot; our last Champions League game was last year in December .
since then , we have played only in the Swedish league , which has not the same level .
the qualification matches do not suff@@ ice . &quot;
hat off in front of Paris !
it was a great game of them !
Gl@@ en@@ core collects $ 2.5 billion through share sales
the mining giant Gl@@ en@@ core , based in Switzerland , who is affected by collap@@ sing commodity prices , collected 2.5 billion dollars on Wednesday due to a stock sale as part of his huge debt redemption plan .
the London @-@ registered company Gl@@ en@@ core said in a statement that it sold new shares worth about 1.6 billion pounds in order to rep@@ ay its own debts .
the company , which has lost 57 percent of its market value this year , fights with falling commodity prices , as China &apos;s economic down@@ turn crush@@ es demand and has a devastating effect on markets .
at the early Wednesday morning , the issu@@ ance of rights accor@@ ded by Gl@@ en@@ cores saw a rapid rise at the top of the London stock exchange .
the share j@@ umped by 2.@@ 77 percent to 13@@ 1.@@ 60 p@@ ence on the FT@@ SE 100 index , which opened 0.@@ 69 percent higher .
Gl@@ en@@ core announced last week the $ 2.5 billion share sale as part of the more comprehensive plans to eradic@@ ate around one third of its 30 billion dollar debt .
the company sold the new hol@@ dings to 125 p@@ ence per share , which meant a 2.4 percent discount on closing price on Tuesday .
there were 1.3 billion shares worth up to 9.@@ 99 percent of the Group .
concerns over long @-@ term growth in China have dropped iron ore prices by about half , coal , copper and other commodity prices have declined by 20 to 40 percent .
refugees arrive in Weimar

X@@ av@@ i : PE@@ P Guardi@@ ola prevented 2008 change to FC Bayern
world and European champion X@@ av@@ i has been playing for the al @-@ S@@ add Sports Club in Qatar since summer 2015
the FC Bayern was obviously just before the commitment of Spain &apos;s super@@ star X@@ av@@ i , who at that time played for FC Barcelona .
eight times Spanish champion , three time poker winner , four times champion league winner , twice champion league winner , twice champion of European champion , twice champion - the title list of X@@ av@@ i is stunning .
in the summer , the 35 @-@ year @-@ old left the FC Barcelona after 24 years and changed to Qatar as al @-@ S@@ add Sports Club .
but in an interview with the Mar@@ ca , X@@ av@@ i reveals that he already stood before the departure from Barcelona in front of the European Championship in 2008 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I told Bar@@ ça to sell me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Madrid won everything , we don &apos;t know anything , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and the registered office of FC Bayern .
X@@ av@@ i : &quot; there was an offer of Bavaria . &quot;
&quot; Rum@@ men@@ ig@@ ge wanted me to have me . &quot;
in the summer of 2008 Jürgen Klin@@ smann took over the FC Bayern .
Guardi@@ ola was the reason that X@@ av@@ i did not change
but the change did not come about .
and the crucial man for this is now working for the German record champion : PE@@ P Guardi@@ ola .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; X@@ av@@ i explains why : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bar@@ ça has signed Guardi@@ ola and I have played a great European . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; PE@@ P told me that I would not change that he could not imagine the crew without me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; with that he got me . &quot;
who knows how Bavaria &apos;s playing time in 2008 / 2009 would have run with X@@ av@@ i .
X@@ av@@ i stood for Bar@@ ca in the quarter@@ fin@@ als of the Champions League against the Bavarian over the entire distance on the grass , switched off the reds ( 4 : 0 , 1 : 1 ) and celebrated the royal class triumph at the end .
matt Dam@@ on plays a variety in film creation
matt Dam@@ on confron@@ ts A@@ fr@@ o @-@ American film@@ maker Eff@@ ie Brown during a discussion on diversity and said she &apos;s not needed behind the scenes .
during a series of Sunday night of HB@@ OS Project Green@@ light , experienced actor Brown interrupted the necessity of alternative perspectives , with reference to a black protagon@@ ist in the chosen script of the project .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if we talk about diversity , then do it in the filling of the film and not in the line @-@ up of the show , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Dam@@ on assured Dam@@ on . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
brown responded shocked , with insul@@ ted un@@ belief and called &quot; Ho@@ o ! wow . okay , &quot; as the comment@@ aries of the actor of The Mar@@ tian signed up .
Dam@@ on and Brown joined the producers Ben Aff@@ l@@ eck and the Far@@ rel@@ ly brothers to discuss the show fin@@ alists .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I want to encourage people to think about - whoever will be the director - how they treat the figure of the Harmony , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Brown first . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the only black person , and she is a s@@ ut@@ te beaten by her white p@@ im@@ p .
the producer of De@@ ar White People joined Leo Angel@@ os and Kri@@ sten Bran@@ c@@ accio for directing right to the film . Dam@@ on answered that her direction &quot; at the end could give us something we don &apos;t want . &quot;
after the discussion was broad@@ cast@@ ed , the Social Media ev@@ oked dis@@ approval of Dam@@ on &apos;s comments .
Twitter users Mr Po@@ oni pushed his anger over the clip by writing &quot; Matt Dam@@ on talking about the only black person in the room so he can explain their diversity - that &apos;s SO WE@@ ISS that it hur@@ ts . &quot;
the T@@ we@@ et served more than 5,000 ret@@ we@@ ets and 4,000 lifts since its release .
Dam@@ on &apos;s comments are at a time when precise rac@@ ist representation in the media is at the forefront of social debate .
after having killed Michael Brown in 2014 by a white police officer , the Black Li@@ ves Mat@@ ter movement achieved a nationwide effect and forced leg@@ is@@ lators and authorities to cur@@ b discrimin@@ atory practices against du@@ sty am@@ bush .
in February , singer Prince added a recording to the movement during the introduction of the nominated albums of the year at Gram@@ my Awards .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; albums still matter &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
like books and black life , albums still have their meaning .
recently , leaders of the Black Li@@ ves Mat@@ ter Movement have published an explanation in response to the question of the Fox News personality , Elisabeth Has@@ sel@@ beck , whether the group should be regarded as a group of hate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the network Black Li@@ ves Mat@@ ter is a love group , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the leaders . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
recently it was announced that Dam@@ on was on a list of enter@@ tain@@ ers , producers and media mo@@ gu@@ le who are invited to visit the pop@@ e to discuss the representation of the Catholic Church in the West .
whether he accepted the invitation or already met the Pope is unclear .
&apos;@@ American N@@ in@@ ja War@@ ri@@ or &apos; crowns first champion
professional sport clim@@ ber and user assistance Isaac Cal@@ di@@ ero became the first ath@@ lete who won the American N@@ in@@ ja War@@ ri@@ or on Monday evening and took home the Grand Prix of $ 1 million .
the competition show , which completed its 7th season , had never experienced a competition participant who could finish all stages of his obstacle course .
during the season finale , two men , Cal@@ di@@ ero and c@@ amer@@ aman Ge@@ off Brit@@ ten managed to finish in the final .
the climbing on a 75 @-@ foot @-@ long climbing rope was part of the last task in 30 seconds .
Brit@@ ten finished the task within the period with which he was the first ath@@ lete to finish the exhau@@ sting phase 4 of American N@@ in@@ ja War@@ ri@@ or . however , Cal@@ di@@ ero completed this challenge in three seconds faster , which made him the winner .
Cal@@ di@@ ero spoke with E ! News after hard @-@ fought victory , still under shock about winning the Grand Prix of $ 1 million .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I mean , it &apos;s amazing to think about it , I &apos;ve never earned more than $ 10,000 or had lived , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Isaac E ! about his he@@ aps of money . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
all of a sudden ... as I can &apos;t even imagine how this is ... the future is unknown .
the executive producer K@@ ent We@@ ed sat down with The Hollywood Repor@@ ter to discuss the final and why Brit@@ ten , although he first ended the course , did not receive any prize money .
after the rules , the money goes to the quick@@ est person .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if there is more than one fin@@ alist , it will be the fastest time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said We@@ ed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
how much money is a wonderful price and life changes , it receives the great grat@@ u@@ ity .
I don &apos;t think he &apos;ll get any res@@ ent@@ ment about it .
he has just been so happy to have done what he has done .
he received the masses of awards from fans .
he is such a great guy and a family father .
he is a hero for his children and his wife .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ge@@ off said to me : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if I should be struck by someone , I am glad that Isaac is Isaac . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and I think Isaac felt exactly as if they had exchanged the roles .
America N@@ in@@ ja War@@ ri@@ or was extended for an eighth season , the shooting will begin in spring 2016 .
Detroit Tig@@ ers sne@@ ak past Minn@@ es@@ ota T@@ wins
MIN@@ NE@@ AP@@ O@@ L@@ IS@@ -- The second half of the season was not especially funny for the Detroit Tig@@ ers .
once upon a time they were one of the best teams in the bas@@ eb@@ all , today the Tig@@ ers are at the last place in the American League Central .
the tig@@ ers are reduced to their role as spo@@ iler , but played this part on Tuesday perfectly against the Minn@@ es@@ ota T@@ wins with 5 @-@ 4 in the target field .
the T@@ wins had a chance to climb up in one half of Houston Ast@@ ros for the second American League Wild@@ card slot .
for Detroit , although only for one evening , it was a return of the three letter F @-@ word which was so difficult to grasp over a large part of the second half of the season .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all victories are fun , no matter how it comes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Tig@@ ers Manager Brad Mis@@ mus . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
tiger @-@ Pit@@ cher Al@@ fre@@ do Simon maintains his early offensive support when Detroit scored three times in the first two inn@@ ings , then once in the sixth and then again in ninth .
Simon ( 13 @-@ 9 ) hit 6 times in the 1 / 3 inn@@ ings and allowed three R@@ uns .
it was only his third successful start in his last nine games .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I want to end this year strongly , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Simon said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it &apos;s hard to throw each game in the bul@@ l@@ pen , and so I want to go into the game very concentrated .
the designated Tiger @-@ Hit@@ ter Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z had three matches and was in two rounds , his first R@@ BI@@ s since mid @-@ August .
it was the first triple hit game by Mart@@ ine@@ z since he had four hits against the Seattle marin@@ ers on July 6th .
&quot; he ble@@ ached the dr@@ um@@ stick , &quot; said Er@@ mus .
he looked good at ( punch training ) , looked much better at the bul@@ l@@ pen , and he put it straight into the game .
with three R@@ uns in the but@@ to@@ cks at the end of the seventh inning , the T@@ wins had their best chance to come back into the game again .
center Fiel@@ der By@@ ron Bu@@ x@@ ton ended the inning with a double on the left field line .
right Fiel@@ der Aaron Hi@@ cks reached a cra@@ yon , and Simon brought his second Bas@@ eman Brian Do@@ zier to the stri@@ ke@@ out before being replaced by the left @-@ handed Bla@@ ine Har@@ dy .
Har@@ dy exceeded the wall , the only man he was confronted with , before the designated ro@@ ok@@ ie drummer Miguel S@@ ano , who had a Two @-@ Run tear from the right @-@ handed Dre@@ w Ver@@ hagen .
with a pair of runners and the closing @-@ run on the second , Ver@@ hagen brought the third Bas@@ eman Tre@@ vor Pl@@ ou@@ ffe to a double play .
it was the 27th time this season in the Major League that Pl@@ ou@@ ffe hit a double play
after adding an insurance run at the end of the ninth inside , the Wall abol@@ ished a R@@ BI double against C@@ loser of the Tig@@ ers Bruce Ron@@ don and achieved the level of 5 @-@ 4 .
however , the right @-@ handed person stab@@ bed S@@ ano in three pitch for his fifth Save .
Detroit benefited at the start of the game from an even non @-@ moving Phi@@ l Hu@@ gh@@ es .
the Tig@@ ers achieved three R@@ uns in the first two inn@@ ings against the right @-@ handed veter@@ an who had been painted from the infrin@@ gement list before the game after he had been missing more than a month because of a back pain .
&quot; obviously not the beginning that I wished for , &quot; said Hu@@ gh@@ es , &quot; but I felt more comfortable when I started and felt that I would create some pretty good pitch there in the third inning . &quot;
after receiving the Le@@ ad@@ off Bat@@ ter , H@@ ush@@ es released a single to Second Bas@@ eman Ian Kin@@ s@@ ler .
a two @-@ out walk for J.@@ D. Mart@@ ine@@ z brought Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z into play , who created a single &quot; up the middle &quot; at the first run of the game .
Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z achieved his 0@@ 21 success series with the runners in the scor@@ ing position .
the third Bas@@ eman Nick Castell@@ anos followed with a single on the right , managed another run , but Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z was thrown out of the game when he tried to get to the third , which ended the threat .
the Tig@@ ers set out in the second , achieved a one @-@ out double by Cat@@ cher James Mc@@ C@@ ann and a Two @-@ Out Single from Center @-@ Fiel@@ der Anthony GO@@ SE to 3 @-@ 0 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was a big blow , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said T@@ wins @-@ Manager Paul Mol@@ itor . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he did not beat very well , but he caught the right place .
Hu@@ gh@@ es found himself in a Pit@@ ch Count , scored no points in the third inning before being replaced by the Reli@@ able right @-@ handed A.@@ J.@@ A@@ chter .
at Hu@@ gh@@ es it came to three R@@ uns with six hits and a walk with four ropes .
notes : Tig@@ ers R@@ HP Ani@@ bal San@@ che@@ z retired due to a violation of the throwing school .
he is examined by Dr James Andre@@ ws who operated the San@@ che@@ z shoulder in 2007 .
San@@ che@@ z , since mid @-@ August on the infrin@@ gement list due to a shoulder dis@@ cord , is to be activated for the start on Wednesday .
with San@@ che@@ z from the game , L@@ HP Daniel Mor@@ ris is removed from the vulner@@ list in order to start the T@@ wins .
Nor@@ ris with 1 @-@ 1 at four starts with the Tig@@ ers , since he was purchased in exchange with L@@ HP David Price on July 30
he has been missing on the right hip joint since 20 August .
the Tig@@ ers and T@@ wins will end their series of three matches at Target Field on Wednesday
Nor@@ ris ( 2 @-@ 2,@@ 4,@@ 43 ER@@ A ) will play against Minn@@ es@@ ota &apos;s R@@ HP Er@@ vin san@@ ana ( 5 @-@ 4 , 4.@@ 73 )
hundreds of refugees are to be signed in Wiesbaden
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a train with hundreds of refugees is on their way to H@@ esse . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his arrival was expected for the night on Wednesday .
the people in it should then be accommodated in emergency shel@@ ters in Wiesbaden , as the City of Wiesbaden submitted on Tuesday evening .
she reck@@ oned with 450 to 750 incoming refugees .
several sports halls of the Hes@@ sian state capital have been prepared in the past few days .
up to 1,000 refugees can temporarily stop there .
they are to be distributed to other local authorities .
in the past ten days , 7@@ 500 people in Hessen , responsible for the first recording , had arrived in Hessen .
also Frankfurt and Han@@ au have set up emergency shel@@ ters in sports halls because of the large number of refugees .
Isch@@ inger : German military measures in Syria an option
the director of the Munich Security Conference , Wolfgang Isch@@ inger , holds military action with German participation in Syria for a possibility .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I believe the decisive re@@ thinking about military action options must not take place without Germany , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he accused the European states &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; collective thro@@ es . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
four years ago , we were happy that the ch@@ ali@@ ce had passed a military involvement in Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now the conflict ended ab@@ rup@@ tly on our door@@ step , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in Deutschl@@ and@@ funk . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the former German ambassador in Washington also called for a massive increase of international aid on the ground for refugees .
Austria controlled at southern and eastern borders
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after Germany , Austria has again established controls on its southern and eastern borders . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Austrian Minister Joh@@ anna Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner announced on Tuesday evening in Austrian TV station ORF , and no one will be returned to Hungary .
Germany too did not send refugees back to Austria .
&quot; no , it has been agreed , &quot; she explained .
on the question of an agreement , which Germany could record a certain number of refugees from Austria a day , Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner said , there have already been talks between the Director General for Public Safety and Repres@@ ent@@ atives in Germany .
they did not call concrete figures and pointed to discussions on Wednesday in Berlin .
over the last few days , tens of thousands of refugees came from Hungary to Austria via the so @-@ called Balkan Route .
their destination is usually Germany .
Chancellor Angela Merkel ( CD@@ U ) and her Austrian colleague Werner F@@ ay@@ mann , together with several other EU leaders , requested a special summit for next week .
Germany had begun on Sunday with temporary border controls .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the EU states have so far not been able to agree on a joint action in the crisis . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the next Tuesday ( 22 September ) , the EU interior ministers want to take a new course for a binding distribution of more than 120@@ ,000 refugees in a special meeting .
in view of the strong refugee traffi@@ cking in Germany , the Con@@ federation wants to support the countries in the initial up@@ take and distribution of people .
the federal government will manage this together with the countries , Merkel announced on Tuesday evening after almost four hour discussions with the Prime Minister in the Chanc@@ ellery of Berlin .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Merkel under@@ lined that those people who need protection depl@@ ore this . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but those who have no lead perspective can &apos;t stay in Germany either .
this conception was strongly divided in the round .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the chan@@ cell@@ or stressed that the state as a whole must now deal with a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; huge effort . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
thousands of desperate refugees are now stuck on the Balkan Route .
Hungary closed its 175 kilometres long border with Serbia on Tuesday night .
a few hours later , the government in Budapest announced to tie the border to Romania with a fence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this neighboring country is unlike Serbia to the EU . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Hungary &apos;s Foreign Minister Peter S@@ zi@@ j@@ jar@@ to said to the planned new border fence , Hungary wanted to prevent tu@@ gs from seeking ev@@ asive flights over Romania .
the Romanian government immediately condemned the plan .
there were first ar@@ rests of people who had crossed the fence .
in Turkey , according to e@@ ye@@ witness reports , thousands of other migrants were on their way to the Greek border .
spac@@ ecraft &apos; Cass@@ ini &apos; finds the ocean on Satur@@ n@@ mond En@@ cel@@ a@@ dus
under the ice cap of the Satur@@ n@@ monds En@@ cel@@ a@@ dus a global ocean sw@@ aps .
this includes researchers from observations of the spac@@ ecraft &quot; Cass@@ ini . &quot;
therefore the moon dan@@ gles easily on its orbit around the ring plan@@ ks .
this pi@@ vot@@ al movement is small but still too large for a permanent cel@@ esti@@ al body , it is said in a communication from Corn@@ ell University in I@@ th@@ aca ( US State of New York ) on Tuesday .
the researchers present their analyses in the journal &quot; I@@ car@@ us . &quot;
it was already known that there must be liquid water under the ice cover of En@@ cel@@ a@@ dus .
thus Cass@@ ini had discovered ice volcan@@ oes in the South Pole of the Satur@@ n@@ monds already in 2006 , sp@@ itting water vap@@ or and ice particles and thus feeding the so @-@ called e @-@ ring of Saturn .
at least at the South Pole there must be a sub@@ terranean sea , astronom@@ ers closed back then .
however , the expansion of the hidden ocean was not clear .

R@@ ama had lam@@ ented over pain at the beginning of the week .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to Munich Li@@ ons , the diagnosis &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is expected to be four weeks of compul@@ sion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is hard for us , R@@ ama is a severe loss . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course we have to think about now , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said sports director N@@ ec@@ at Ay@@ gü@@ n from the &quot; Bild &quot; newspaper with a view to the potential obligation of an un@@ compromising professional . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
as a training guest , the six@@ ties initially presented a defensive character .
the 30 @-@ year @-@ old Hr@@ vo@@ je C@@ ale was active in Belgium and was already under contract at V@@ f@@ L Wolfs@@ burg .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Cro@@ at currently has &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the opportunity to prove his skills . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

no diet fruit - man@@ goes contain a lot of sugar
man@@ goes are exotic and juicy @-@ sweet .
but whoever wants to pay attention to his slender line will often be dis@@ cour@@ aged by them .
man@@ goes contain relatively lots of sugar - above all su@@ c@@ rose .
the exotic fruits are healthy nevertheless : they contain B vitamins as well as vitamins E and C. In particular , man@@ goes contain a lot of vitamin A and its prec@@ ursor beta @-@ carot@@ ene .
those who eat the fruits thus support vision , immune system and metabolic processes in the body .
when you buy man@@ goes , you should not be too soft or too firm and smell pleasantly .
the peel colour alone says nothing about how ripe the fruit is - so even green man@@ goes can taste delicious .
they should be stored at room temperature and consumed within a few days .
then they taste pure or in sweet foods .
a man@@ go also gives hearty dishes a special note .

first fo@@ eh@@ ement storm , then distinctive cold front
the night falls in the valleys of the Alp@@ enn@@ ord@@ side of the F@@ öhn , as Met@@ e@@ o@@ Schweiz has announced on Tuesday .
on Wednesday and the night on Thursday , the fo@@ eh@@ n blows partly with storm strength through the fo@@ eh@@ ement valleys .
following F@@ öhn@@ ende on Thursday morning we cross a marked cold front that brings heavy rainf@@ alls , wind gu@@ sts and a drop in temperature .
as Met@@ e@@ o@@ News writes in a message , Switzerland is currently on the front of an extensive low @-@ pressure area across the British Is@@ les in a powerful south @-@ west direction .
on the mountain side of the Alps , the fo@@ eh@@ n breaks through the valleys in the night .
as a consequence , the F@@ öhn blows in the fo@@ es from 60 to 100 km / h , isolated and partly in the Ur@@ ner@@ land partly also with over 100 km / h in the Ur@@ ner@@ land .
the F@@ öhn can advance into the neighbouring Mitt@@ ell@@ and , and even hur@@ ri@@ can@@ es of over 120 km / h are possible on the mountains .
while in the north on Wednesday , F@@ öhn winds up for summer temperatures of 23 to 27 degrees Celsius , the humidity begins to st@@ ow at the Alpine hill@@ side .
here rain starts , which lasts until Thursday evening .
in total , in the next 48 hours , in total , more than 100 liters of rain per square meter must be calculated in the south of the Alps , which after the last few days has already fallen large amounts of rainf@@ all .
the f@@ öhn winds its way on Thursday morning , in which a cold front is rolling with a strong , partly weather@@ ed rain from west to east over Switzerland .
along with the cold front , the wind refresh@@ es strongly until stor@@ my , and temperatures are clearly going back .
the following days present themselves in the north with 15 to 20 degrees , in the south , on the other hand , it will be sunny and warmer with up to 25 degrees on the weekend .
Rome has now a Martin @-@ Luther @-@ Platz
almost 500 years after the Reformation , there is now a Martin Luther Square in Rome .
in the presence of Prime Minister Ign@@ azi@@ o Mar@@ ino , a hitherto nam@@ eless place in the park on the O@@ pp@@ io Hill was chri@@ sten@@ ed on the name of the German Re@@ former .
at the &quot; Piazza Martin Lu@@ ter@@ o &quot; he is now honoured as the &quot; German The@@ ologi@@ an of the Reformation . &quot;
the park is located in the middle of the old Rome next to the Col@@ os@@ se@@ um .
the name was applied to the work community of the Protestant churches in Rome .
Jens @-@ Martin Kr@@ use , pastor of the Evangel@@ ical Lutheran Church in Rome , reminded on Wednesday that Protest@@ ants in the city of Pop@@ es could often live only in secret for centuries as a minority .
the square in a symbolic way makes it visible that their tradition of Christian faith is welcome in Rome .
Martin Luther ( 14@@ 83 @-@ 15@@ 46 ) regarded himself as a young August@@ inian mon@@ k around the turn of the year 15@@ 10 / 11 a few months in Rome .
he felt the city at that time as a corrupt sin@@ ner .
according to histori@@ ans , his negative impressions should have reinforced him in his later fight against Rome .
Luther had then initiated the division of the oc@@ ci@@ dental church with his theses on the trade off of the indul@@ gen@@ ces .
hammer artist invested three years in the personal interpretation of the Bible
Jesus with the ( gil@@ ded ) crown of thorns is one of the main works that Ot@@ mar Alt painted for his Bible .
Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost wrote the introduction and updated Bible texts .
at the beginning was the Word ?
no , not at the Ot@@ mar @-@ Old @-@ Bible , which has now appeared with magnificent pictures .
at the beginning was the image for Ot@@ mar Alt , who formulated his very personal interpretations of biblical stories on paper and canvas in 150 subjects .
his &quot; language &quot; with colorful colors and imagin@@ ative shapes has received the 75 @-@ year @-@ old - which is by no means equivalent to &quot; funny &quot; pictures .
on the contrary : adapted to the respective subjects , this can be quite dark .
Ot@@ mar Alt has worked on his Bible project for about three years , for which he has made a subjective artistic selection from the many subject areas of the book of all books .
these are cycles , which are devoted to subjects such as cross@@ roads , pl@@ agues , commandments or fa@@ therhood .
thus he immediately fascinated several partners : this applies to Luther @-@ Verlag with his the@@ ological orientation as well as for the Kettler @-@ Verlag with his focus on art books .
and there is above all the author Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost , who has dealt with the biblical passages on the basis of painting .
he has interpreted the biblical passages selected by Ot@@ mar , and so into today , translated into current connections .
these texts are like verbal mirrors of old painting .
they are embedded between the original Bible quotation by Martin Luther and each with a set of the artist , who here formul@@ ates his very personal thoughts to the respective situation .
the jewelry cord has golden letters .
thus the 75 @-@ year @-@ old allows a deep insight into his soul , his emotions .
this is a high level of in@@ timacy .
emotions were ultimately the trigger for the Bible project : Ot@@ mar Alt , born in Wer@@ ni@@ ger@@ ode in 1940 and grew up in Berlin , comes from a family that belonged to the strict Protestant rule .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; education took place already with the cane , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Ot@@ mar Alt . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have tried to work up this , so that I may also be reconc@@ iled with the Lord &apos;s Father again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his second aim is to make art more important in a faster time : &quot; the perception of visual worlds is now shaped by advertising , and that is loud .
symbol@@ ism is being displaced .
artists have a different desire and bl@@ iss to show things .
images always have something mysterious and are not decorative .
&quot; in this respect I am a din@@ osau@@ r . &quot;
Ot@@ mar Alt wants the viewers to &quot; fall into the images , &quot; letting them look at them , discover and feel the power they have : &quot; the image is looking for its counterpart . &quot;
on Tuesday Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost took part in the presentation of the Ot@@ mar @-@ Old Bible in the Ot@@ mar @-@ Old Foundation , &quot; always &quot; a lover of Ot@@ mar Al@@ ts &apos;s art : &quot; I like how he understands life with his pictures . &quot;
I did not care to fully grasp the Bible , but chose the most important , even mysterious themes for him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was no collaboration on eye level , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Alt@@ ep@@ ost : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the pictures , the text only explains . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for Hans M@@ öh@@ ler of Luther @-@ Verlag , this work is an invitation to &quot; deep@@ en his life and find freedom . &quot;
Ot@@ mar Al@@ ts &apos;s pictures speak for M@@ öh@@ ler both the ( Bibli@@ cal ) language of love and responsibility .
a part of the origin@@ als - paper and linen pictures - will be presented for the first time in an exhibition opened on 15 November in the Ot@@ mar @-@ Old Foundation .
start of construction for BM@@ X track is near
plans made , place found , company commissioned to model earth moun@@ ds for a circuit : one year later almost everything was finished - but before the official opening of the BM@@ X track , it was over again .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; failures in politics and administration ensured displacement , especially among residents who did not want to tolerate the railways . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
so hill de@@ ported , new place sought - now with formal planning and application for building permission .
the approval will take place in October , the first municipal coun@@ cill@@ or Sabine Mos@@ eb@@ ach @-@ Bo@@ ck was now able to communicate in the children &apos;s and youth affairs committee .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I hope that this year is still visible , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it should then be started without a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; further memorial &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the work of the former indoor pool . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
DF@@ B intensi@@ fies engagement for refugees
the DF@@ B extends its commitment to refugees by 2019 , while the Bundes@@ liga represents a clear sign on the weekend .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; football responds to the situation in Germany and sec@@ ures its help in tac@@ kling the problems facing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I consider this the biggest challenge of our country since re@@ unification . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no one can say in principle that nothing is about me , I have nothing to do with it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this has to be interesting for everyone to get a grip on this subject , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said DF@@ B CEO Wolfgang Ni@@ ers@@ bach . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the annual meeting with German Chancellor Angela Merkel on 23 September in Berlin he wants to discuss the refugee situation in Germany intensively .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am in the chan@@ cell@@ or &apos;s office next Wednesday and meet the minister of state Mrs. Ö@@ zo@@ ğ@@ u@@ z and the chan@@ cell@@ or . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there will certainly play a central role , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he announced . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
football could and would help .
but the crucial course must be policy .
therefore , the German Football Association extended its refugee initiative &quot; 1 : 0 for a welcome &quot; by four years .
&quot; we have ensured that this program will continue until 2019 , &quot; said Ni@@ ers@@ bach on the edge of the UEF@@ A meeting in St. Julian &apos;s / Malta .
also some federal lists support this program .
already on this weekend , the 36 professional associations set a clear sign when they will wear the print &quot; We help - # Refu@@ ge@@ es@@ Welcome &quot; instead of the usual sponsor@@ ship logo ( Her@@ mes ) .
&quot; we also want to make it clear that all should help where and how they can only , &quot; said Le@@ verk@@ usen sports chief Ru@@ di Vö@@ ller of the &quot; Bild &quot; newspaper ( Tuesday ) and described the project as &quot; a matter of course . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the refugee drama goes on everyone , nobody is allowed to go away . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have to use our bla@@ sting power , our influence and our possibilities to help the many refugees that have suffered so incredibly , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Her@@ tha @-@ Manager Michael Pre@@ etz . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
H@@ offen@@ heim &apos;s managing director Peter Ret@@ tig spoke of a prominent sign of the league . &quot;
the national team of the women invites 100 refugees to Halle / Sa@@ ale for the European quali@@ fier match against Hungary this Friday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ni@@ ers@@ bach described the support of refugees as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a large community of German football . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
that all 36 licensing clubs had started their own projects in their places is great .
just as great is that small and smallest clubs are active .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the message &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 1 : 0 for a welcome &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that we have spent is lived in football . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is of enormous importance , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in this and the next year , the association will jointly issue 300@@ ,000 euros for the integration of refugees in cooperation with the DF@@ B @-@ Sel@@ ection and the Federal Government .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the clubs have already called up the whole sum for 2015 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reported Ni@@ ers@@ bach . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
reports : SAP CEO loses an eye in case of accident
according to several reports , the CEO of Europe &apos;s largest software company , Bill Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t , has re@@ port@@ edly lost the left eye due to a fall in early July .
in the accident on the stairs in his brother &apos;s house in the USA , he dropped onto a glass jar after midnight , which he carried in his left hand , reports the &quot; Wirtschafts@@ Woche &quot; on Wednesday .
&quot; he is almost bru@@ ised , impot@@ ent , then dra@@ gged out into the street - that &apos;s what he told us last week , &quot; quotes the &quot; Wi@@ Wo &quot; SAP Co @-@ Fo@@ under of Has@@ so Platt@@ ner .
but Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t can pursue his work .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the beginning of October we meet at the Supervisory Board meeting in Wall@@ dorf , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Platt@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the 54 @-@ year @-@ old manager is at the meeting and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fully working &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t announced in an interview with the &quot; Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung &quot; ( Thursday edition ) , which will come back to Germany in October and will continue to lead the software company .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m full for SAP , full in my job . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; of course I was in regular contact with the Supervisory Board and its chairman , Has@@ so Platt@@ ner , &quot; said Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t of the &quot; S@@ Z . &quot;
Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t usually sw@@ ings between Germany and the US , but since summer he was no longer in the German SAP headquarters in Wall@@ dorf .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is important to him to go to the public with such a personal story , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the manager of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; S@@ Z &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is important to stand up again when you are fallen . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mc@@ L@@ aren replacement pilot Magn@@ us@@ sen except skir@@ m@@ ish ...

football : Bv@@ B without Re@@ us against Kr@@ as@@ no@@ dar : female f@@ eller in the gate
with Bor@@ ussi@@ a Dortmund , all hopes for a com@@ eback of Marco Re@@ us have finally broken down in the first group game of the Europa League .
the national player will also be missing the table leader of the Bundes@@ liga in Du@@ el with the FK Kr@@ as@@ no@@ dar on Thursday ( 7.@@ 00 pm / Sky ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we can &apos;t resort to him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Thomas Tu@@ ch@@ el on Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
whether Re@@ us will be back on Sunday in the Bundes@@ liga @-@ Top@@ Game against Le@@ verk@@ usen , the BV@@ B coach left : &quot; we expect a return from him to the training on Friday . &quot;
given the high load of its professionals , Tu@@ ch@@ el will not only change its parent position on the Re@@ us position .
he announced a change to the door guard position .
therefore Roman Wei@@ den@@ f@@ eller takes the place of a family @-@ based Roman natur@@ ki .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he trained at an absolute top level , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the football teacher praised the world champion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
whether Wei@@ den@@ f@@ eller will be used in all European league games in the future , however , Tu@@ ch@@ el left open .
with high probability he will also play the second game .
the for@@ mid@@ able statement by fellow players Re@@ us that the final suit for the BV@@ B in the Europa League must be the goal , mid@@ fiel@@ der Julian Wei@@ gl aims to re@@ trace : &quot; this is not so wrong with Marco . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think we have a good chance to pick up the title . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
robot cars : government wants leadership for Germany
according to the Federal Government &apos;s will , Germany should be a pioneer in the change of the car .
on Wednesday , the Federal Cab@@ inet decided on a strategy paper from the House of Transport Minister Alexander Do@@ br@@ ind@@ t ( CS@@ U ) , which includes investments in the expansion of digital infrastructure .
Do@@ br@@ ind@@ t spoke of a &quot; new mobility era &quot; on Wednesday in Frankfurt on the edge of the Autom@@ esse IAA .
automated and connected driving will increase road safety and ensure less traffic jams , said Do@@ br@@ ind@@ t .
he also wants to discuss the subject with his colleagues from the G@@ 7 states , which coinci@@ de with industry representatives at the IAA .
the strategy paper of the Ministry of Transport emphasizes the importance of mobile broad@@ band expansion and rapid increase in digital radio broadcasting .
there is currently a test track on the motorway 9 in Bavaria to test new technology .
in order for the driver to &quot; avoid any additional liability risks , &quot; the Federal Government wants to examine the legal framework and , where necessary , adapt to the new developments . &quot;
for example , Germany wants to make sure that the permissible maximum speed for self @-@ prop@@ elled cars is lifted from 10 to 130 km / h .
the Federal Government also wants to make use of an amend@@ ment to the Vienna Convention , which so far only fores@@ ees the human being as a driver .
in automated driving , the car increasingly takes the lead , and the driver becomes more and more passengers .
the technology is based on sensors and cameras that capture the environment and process data in seconds .
according to a study submitted by the Ministry of Economy , highly automated driving on motor@@ ways by 2020 will be technically possible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nevertheless , dri@@ ver@@ less vehicles on public roads &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; can be expected only far after 2020 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
value added in the field of driver assistance systems and highly automated driving functions at the German site estimate the authors of the study for 20@@ 25 to around 8.@@ 4 billion euros .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the digital networking of cars can lead to greater safety and efficiency in road traffic , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said S@@ ören Bar@@ to@@ l . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , the question of liability in case of accidents and the safety of the driver &apos;s personal data must be clari@@ fied clearly .
still the Germans don &apos;t see self @-@ prop@@ elled cars skep@@ tical - much more than Fren@@ ch@@ men or Americans .
a survey conducted by the For@@ sa Institute on Wednesday , on behalf of the test organization Dek@@ ra , comes to the conclusion that only eight percent of Germans believe that autonomous driving cars will prevail over the next ten years , 32 percent do not expect at all in 20 years , 31 percent do not believe in it at all .
in France , 21 percent of respon@@ dents estimate up to 20@@ 25 with autonomous driving cars , in the United States 33 percent .
in any case , drivers in Germany are not yet ready to rely completely on a self @-@ prop@@ elled vehicle .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; following a survey by Digital verb@@ ands Bit@@ kom , only seven percent would agree to give control over the entire journey on all roads . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the motorway , the traffic in flowing traffic could at least imagine 15 percent , in traffic jams 45 percent .
good every fourth would leave the car under control under no circumstances .
Bol@@ l says team and double start at table tennis @-@ EM
according to the present status , the Düsseldorf @-@ based Düsseldorf wants to strike only in sing@@ les from September 25 to October 4 .
the final decision should be made at the latest on September 22 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a huge loss for our team . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the boys learned it in the morning . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are strong enough even without Timo to clin@@ ch the title , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Federal President Jörg Ro@@ ß@@ kopf during the EM course in Düsseldorf . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at this time , Bol@@ l was on the flight to a long @-@ term sponsored walk in China .
the 34 year old German champion is expected to return on Friday .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today I can no longer say that I am the en@@ f@@ ant terrible of hau@@ te cou@@ ture because I have white hair . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; earlier it was ble@@ ached , now it &apos;s real , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gau@@ l@@ tier . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for the visitors of the exhibition &quot; From The Side@@ walk To The Cat@@ walk &quot; ( From the side@@ walk to the cat@@ walk ) , which is to be seen in the Kunsth@@ alle of the Hyp@@ o Cultural Foundation from September 18 onwards , it is a good luck that the designer has changed his initial attitude towards a show on his person .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for me , an exhibition sounded a bit of death , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
when you die , you come to the museum .
the impressive collection had previously been made in Montreal and in Paris .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s about so much more than just beautiful clothes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the director of the Kunsth@@ alle , Roger Di@@ e@@ deren . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is about tolerance , acceptance and the vision of an open society .
the exhibits give an insight into the in@@ conceivable work of the man who has written fashion history without ever having completed an apprenticeship .
the show is not chron@@ ologically structured , but it is an excell@@ ently choreograph@@ ed overall art work for which a lot of effort was carried out : to freeze the d@@ olls , for example , a sty@@ list was specially hired .
according to the cur@@ ator Thierry @-@ Maxim@@ e L@@ ori@@ ot gr@@ asp@@ ed 14 tons of material according to the cur@@ ator Thierry @-@ Maxim@@ e L@@ ori@@ ot .
just before the start of the Oktober@@ fest there was still a special treat : a leather pants outfit with cor@@ set .
Hei@@ di meets Madonna .
he has always been interested in strong women ( &quot; women are smar@@ ter than men &quot; ) and for people who are a bit different , Gau@@ l@@ tier said .
also Gau@@ l@@ tiers old Ted@@ dy can be seen in the exhibition .
he stands for the first , tent@@ ative fashionable Geh@@ versuche of the designer .
as a child ( he was not a good student and bad in football ) he put on his Ted@@ dy B@@ H@@ s and clothes , Gau@@ l@@ tier said .
his parents would not have allowed him to play with a doll .
he later taught the design of fashion by himself .
he st@@ ole fashion magazines and looked at the designs of other designers , as Gau@@ l@@ tier had told in Munich .
later I bought them , of course .
for his first fashion show he couldn &apos;t pay the models .
they got nothing , but they were allowed to keep the clothes .
jewellery instead of Gar@@ dine - P@@ lau@@ ener Spitze as fashion niche
in the past , it was about the long embroi@@ dery machines in and around P@@ lau@@ en to make metres .
the embroi@@ dered fabrics and tips were created in large quantities for customers , which they worked for , for example , for blankets and she@@ ers .
this alone is no longer working today , says Andreas Rein@@ hardt , Managing Director of the Mo@@ ira P@@ lau@@ en .
instead , fashion is important again .
in the early days of the P@@ lau@@ ener Spitze , fashion played a major role , was then pushed out by the home textile industry - and is now being re@@ discovered as a niche .
Rein@@ hardt calls some examples : lace in jewelry , accessories like bags and for regional costumes .
in general , the so @-@ called vintage fashion , which leans on past styles , increases the order potential .
those who don &apos;t use any ni@@ ches in the textile industry in Germany are no longer on the market .
with us , they already make half of all orders .
Mo@@ ira P@@ lau@@ en , together with nine other companies , is a member of the industry association P@@ lau@@ ener Spitze and embroi@@ dery .
only they are allowed to wear the protected label .
over the past 15 years , around 80 percent of sales have been broken off .
there are almost no private specialty shops and wholes@@ al@@ ers .
our products hardly reach our customers in this way .
nowadays the bulk goods are produced much cheaper in Asia and almost exclusively distributed over chains .
moreover , the export , which is currently being exported to Russia and the USA , is weaker .
so there are plenty of reasons for new ways .
the industry association also aims to focus on environmental awareness , as C@@ ord@@ ula Bauer explains about the embroi@@ dery in Fal@@ k@@ enstein : &quot; for this year we have been running a quality seal that shows that we produce environmentally and socially compatible . &quot;
Rein@@ hardt adds : &quot; this applies to the materials used . &quot;
graduate designer U@@ te Schmidt teaches at the Schne@@ e@@ berg regional office of the West@@ säch@@ sische Hochschule Z@@ wick@@ au - at the Faculty of Applied Arts - and special@@ ises in embroi@@ dery and lace .
in order to counter@@ act the competition from the Asian region , you have to find high @-@ quality and innovative products .
it takes time and courage .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is a tension between the fresh@@ est ideas of designers and companies that need to think above all economically , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Schmidt . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
therefore , an existing design is often only slightly varied in order to maintain a customer base .
a few years ago , textile designer Kat@@ i Reu@@ ter re@@ vit@@ alized the historic snow ball point .
the machine cuts small spheres at some places .
the P@@ lau@@ ener gold@@ smith &apos;s master Bianca Hal@@ leb@@ ach @-@ K@@ rau@@ ße took inspiration : &quot; before that I could not start with traditional P@@ lau@@ ener Spitze . &quot;
now she uses the snow@@ ball tip for her jewelry .
in a complex process , it shapes the pattern in silver .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many people of the region identify themselves with the topic of P@@ lau@@ ener Spitze - young and old , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Reu@@ ter . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they also deliver to the USA , to Australia and to Finland , especially to customers whose ancestors lived in P@@ lau@@ en and surroundings and who want to have a mem@@ ento .
with this I see my jewellery as a modern ambassador of the P@@ lau@@ ener Spitze .
Disney plans new &quot; Mary P@@ opp@@ ins &quot; film

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Entertainment Week@@ ly &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is not a new movie but a kind of continuation which takes place 20 years after the first film with the magic baby girl . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is about the experiences of the N@@ anny with the B@@ anks family in times of the world economic crisis in England .
who plays P@@ opp@@ ins for more than 50 years after Ju@@ lie Andre@@ ws is still unclear .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but the director is already fixed : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ro@@ b Marshall , recently with &quot; In@@ to the W@@ oods &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the cinema . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
XI ur@@ ges to open the economy wider to the world
the economy must open wider to the outside to promote growth , President X@@ i J@@ in@@ ping said on Tuesday of a group that was tas@@ ked with steering the reform .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; China should strive to attract foreign investment and know @-@ how and to improve the strategies for business start @-@ ups , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in a speech at the 16th session of the Central Leadership Group for deep@@ ening a comprehensive reform . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
promoting new start @-@ ups and driving reforms will bring new momentum and vitality and provide new space for economic growth , said X@@ i .
the Group has adopted a number of guidelines including a negative list to regulate the market access , relaxation of border control policies , promotion of state enterprises ( SO@@ E ) , private capital , and over@@ haul of the citizen reporting system .
after the statement a negative list is created which identifies sectors and companies that are not eligible for investments .
the system is gradually being tested and improved by testing programs .
the initiative is of importance as it as@@ signs a major role in the allocation of resources to the market , guaranteeing a legally @-@ owned business environment and shaping the market more open , said the statement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the government will also ease controls on the powers transferred to the company and ensure companies decide how they manage their business . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the statement also said that China will allow border areas to explore new models of cross @-@ border economic cooperation and new mechanisms to promote regional growth .
as part of an offer to open state @-@ controlled sectors , further areas for private investment are opened .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the government will not change its policy towards foreign investments and will protect the legitimate interests of foreign @-@ financed companies and provide better services for them , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the statement . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; furthermore , it is easier for foreigners to apply for a permanent residence permit or &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Green Card &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by optim@@ ising the requirements and facilit@@ ating the application process . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the right of lawyers to guarantee their activity , and to employ professional judges and prosec@@ ut@@ ors , was also discussed at a meeting .
at the meeting , Prime Minister Li Ke@@ q@@ i@@ ang and important leaders such as Li@@ u Y@@ un@@ sh@@ an and Z@@ hang Ga@@ oli participated , as reported in a declaration issued after the meeting .
EU aims to double the level of mercury in pre@@ dat@@ ory fish
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the European Commission wants to double the limit values for mercury in large car@@ ni@@ vor@@ es and thus reasonably increase consumers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; dose of the neur@@ on . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Consumer Organization F@@ ood@@ watch , which is a corresponding EU working paper , critic@@ ised the plans : &quot; risks and side effects of missed industrial and environmental policies are passed on to pregnant women and infants with full force , &quot; explained Matthias Wolf@@ sch@@ midt of F@@ ood@@ watch .
according to Wolf@@ sch@@ midt , the limit values of the nerve agent for large fish at the end of the food chain , such as shar@@ k or s@@ wor@@ d@@ fish from &quot; economic policy reasons , &quot; should be raised from one to two milli@@ grams of mercury per kil@@ ogram of fish .
however , large pre@@ dat@@ ory fish are already so strongly polluted with mercury , that approximately 50 per cent of the cat@@ ches may not be sold on the basis of the still valid limit values .
after dou@@ bling the limit values only 14.@@ 5 percent would be in@@ comprehensible .
in return for this e@@ asing , the EU , according to F@@ ood@@ watch , wants to intensi@@ fy the limit values for other fish from currently 0.5 milli@@ grams to 0.1 milli@@ grams of mercury per kil@@ ogram .
however , F@@ ood@@ watch called this as a &quot; trick &quot; because smaller cem@@ et@@ fish , such as car@@ p are usually so low @-@ bur@@ dened , that they already comply with the planned top @-@ levels already today .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the reduction in small fish is therefore &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a per@@ fi@@ dy distra@@ ction manoeu@@ vre that helps the economy alone , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained Wolf@@ sch@@ midt . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
mercury is a heavy metal which is highly toxic to humans , which is particularly rich in pre@@ dat@@ ory fish .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Federal Government therefore warns that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; small amounts can already cause serious damage to the nervous system &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Federal Ministry of the Environment declares on its homepage with regard to the current maximum values , however , that a &quot; health threat to the general population &quot; is not to be expected .
mercury penet@@ rates the environment through coal combustion .
according to a written confirmation by the German Federal Ministry of the Environment , the German coal @-@ fired power stations meet more than six tons of mercury per year , two thirds of the total issued in Germany .
the concentration of mercury in fish such as Elbe , Rhine and Danube was &quot; permanently and region@@ ally crossed , &quot; the &quot; Spiegel &quot; had cited in March from the paper .
last year , Europe @-@ wide warning against mercury in fish was already among the most commonly reported health risks in the EU warning system RA@@ S@@ FF .
