in order to achieve the goal set out in Article 28 , the material accounting is used as a safeguard measure of fundamental importance , verb@@ al engagement with spatial input and observation as important supplementary measures .
the technical conclusion of the audit by the organization is carried out by an explanation , in which the quantity of material which is not proven for a given period of time , indicating the accuracy limits for the indicated me@@ gen is specified for each material balance zone .
in carrying out its review , the Organization makes according to Article 3 full use of the security system of the Community .
the accounting and control system of the core material community in accordance with this Convention is based on a breakdown of material sheet zones .
in the application of its security measures , the Community shall make use of the procedures and measures of the following type and , as far as it is necessary , to see how it is defined in the supplementary agreements and are expe@@ dient :
a ) a measurement system to determine the quantities of preserved , produced , shipping , lost or otherwise distant core material and the stock quantity ;
B ) the evaluation of re@@ produci@@ bility and accuracy of measurements and estim@@ ation of measurement uncertainty ;
C ) procedures for determination , testing and evaluation of differences in the measurements of sender and recipient ;
( e ) Proced@@ ure for ass@@ essing accumulation of non @-@ measured inventory and un@@ measured losses ;
F ) a report and report system , which provides the core material stock for each material balance zone and the changes of this stock , including the one and out of the material balance zone ;
g ) provisions that ensure that accounting procedures and agreements are carried out correctly ;
h ) Process to reimbur@@ se reports to the organization in accordance with Articles 59 to 65 and 67 to 69 .
the security measures pursuant to this Convention are not based on material in mining or in the field of ore treatment .
( B ) Uran@@ ium or th@@ orium @-@ containing material , which has not yet reached the phase of the nuclear fuel cycle , entered into the States , the community of the organization shares the quantity and composition of the material unless it is introduced for specific non @-@ nuclear purposes ;
C ) leaving core material suitable for fuel production or is@@ ot@@ opic enrich@@ ment , the plant or the process phase in which it is produced , or if this core material or other , in a later stage of the nuclear fuel cycle , is introduced into the states , it is subject to the other assurance measures mentioned in this Convention .
a ) The provisions provided in this Convention shall be termin@@ ated for core material under the conditions specified in Article 11 . if the prerequis@@ ites mentioned in Article 11 are not fulfilled , however , if the withdrawal of nuclear materials , the security measures under this agreement is not possible or desirable , the organization and the community shall consult each other on the application of appropriate security measures .
B ) The security measures en@@ vis@@ aged in this Convention shall be termin@@ ated for core material under the conditions specified in Article 13 , provided that the organization and the community clearly state that this core material is virtually non @-@ re@@ cover@@ able .
on request of the Community , the organization liber@@ ates the following core material from the security measures according to this Convention :
a ) Special fis@@ sile material when used in grams - or smaller amounts as a sensor in instruments ;
B ) core material if it is used for non @-@ nuclear activities in accordance with Article 13 , if such core material is re@@ cover@@ able , and
C ) Pl@@ ut@@ onium with an is@@ ot@@ ope concentration of Pl@@ ut@@ onium @-@ 238 , which is more than 80 % .
at the request of the Community , the organisation fre@@ es nuclear materials , which would otherwise be subject to security measures according to this Convention , from these safegu@@ ards , provided that the total amount of core material delivered by this article in the States is at no time more than
a ) a total of one kilogra@@ m of special p@@ alt@@ able material , which can consist of one or more of the following materials :
( II ) Uran@@ ium with an accumulation of 0.2 ( 20 % ) and above , calculated by multip@@ lication of his weight with enrich@@ ment ,
( III ) Uran@@ ium with an enrich@@ ment which is below 0.2 ( 20 % ) and above that of natural ur@@ an is calculated by the multip@@ lication of his weight with the five @-@ fold square of enrich@@ ment ;
B ) a total of ten metric tons of natural ur@@ an and de@@ pl@@ eted ur@@ an@@ ium with enrich@@ ment of more than 0.0@@ 05 ( 0.5 % ) ;
C ) twenty metric tons of de@@ pl@@ eted ur@@ an@@ ium with enrich@@ ment of 0.0@@ 05 ( 0.5 % ) or below ;
if the delivered core material is to be processed or stored together with core material that is subject to the security measures pursuant to this Convention , precau@@ tions for the re@@ use of the securing measures are made on that material .
the association meets with the organization supplementary agreements , which in the extent necessary for the successful and effective execution of the tasks of the organization under this agreement , determine in detail how the procedures laid down in the Convention are to be applied .
the supplementary agreements may be extended or modified without amend@@ ments to this Convention in agreement between the organization and the community .
the supplementary agreements will come into force at the same time or as soon as possible after the entry into force of this Convention . the organization , the community and the states undertake all efforts to enable these agreements to enter into force within nin@@ ety days after the entry into force of this Convention ; an extension of this period requires the agreement between the organization , the community and the states .
on the basis of the initial report mentioned in Article 62 , the organization provides a summar@@ ised inventory of the whole of the nuclear material underlying the security measures of this Convention in the states , irrespective of its origin , and continues to carry out this inventory due to the subsequent reports and the results of its follow @-@ up examinations .
between the European Economic Community ( EEC ) and its Member States Belgium , Denmark , Federal Republic of Germany , France , Ireland , Italy , Luxembourg , the Netherlands , United Kingdom ( Member States ) on the one hand and the International Development Organisation ( Organisation ) on the other
the EEC has decided to contribute to the special action programme specified at the Conference on International Economic Cooperation in order to help meet the immediate needs of individual countries with low in@@ comes , whose development is ham@@ pered by common resource @-@ related problems .
C ) It is the objective of the EEC and the Member States that the entire contribution of the Member States is bound within six months of entering into force of the agreement and as far as possible within two years after entry into force in the form of loans , and the organization will do its utmost to achieve this goal .
D ) The EEC and the Organization have consul@@ ted each other on the proposed implementation and administration of this agreement and the intermediate ties to ensure a broad and balanced geographical distribution within the framework of this agreement .
to this end , the organization of the EEC has presented a table showing how it intends to apply the criteria laid down in this agreement -
the organization establishes a special account under the term &quot; transaction account &quot; which consists of the funds which the Member States contribute to the transaction account in accordance with this Agreement ; this account is referred to as Administrator by the Organization ( herein@@ after referred to as &quot; Administrator &quot; ) , and only to the purpose specified in this Agreement , and in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement .
the transaction account is se@@ per@@ ated separately and separated from all other accounts and assets of the organization .
the contributions are to be paid as follows : a ) Payment is made in the form of cash or non @-@ interest deb@@ its of the member state , which shall be depos@@ ited on demand in the currency of the concerned state at order of the organization as the administrator of the special transaction account and to be depos@@ ited with the organization in the country concerned .
B ) The payment shall be made in two inst@@ al@@ ments ( i ) the first in the amount of at least 45 v . h . the contribution within 30 days after entry into force of this agreement or to another between the EEC and the administrator agreed upon ;
II ) the second in the amount of the remain@@ der of the contribution to January 1 , 1979 or at any other time agreed between the EEC and the administrator , taking into account the dead@@ lines necessary for parliamentary approval of the annual budget plans .
C ) Any Member State may , upon request , make payments before the a@@ forem@@ en@@ tioned dates .
according to the usual procedure of the organization , the ste@@ ward assumes approximately proportional concer@@ tina drawing on the cash or the Notes , in order to cover the expenses for the transaction loans and to balance the special transaction account in a reasonable way .
when gran@@ ting these loans , the administrator can be guided by the following factors in accordance with the terms of the EEC :
( III ) to the extent that international economic factors contributed to the country &apos;s current and fores@@ e@@ eable economic problems ;
( VI ) the composition and the tendency of the country &apos;s debt service and its further capacity for lending to loan conditions without discount ; and
VII ) the extent to which the problems of the respective countries are regulated by contributions from other sources .
any transaction loan serves to finance a clearly defined and rapidly payable development program or project ( including a sec@@ toral project ) , irrespective of whether it is part of the organization &apos;s lending programme or not , according to the procedures and practices applied to the organization funded by the organization ( letter b ) of the pre@@ am@@ ble to this agreement .
the funds of the transaction account may not be used instead of ordinary funds of the International Bank for Rec@@ on@@ struction and Development ( Bank ) or the Organization , which are bound in the context of a loan or credit for a program or project which has already been approved by the directors of the Bank or the Organization on the day of the entry into force .
apart from Section 4 , special deals are subject to the same rep@@ ay@@ ment conditions which are generally applicable to the development loans granted by the organization ; thus , in ten years of free years , they are ref@@ und@@ able in 50 years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; transaction loans are granted in one or more currencies of the member states and are ref@@ und@@ able in these currencies . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
amounts for payment of this clock have to be paid directly to the organisation they retain .
any transaction loan is to be identified by a separate loan agreement between the recipient country and the administrator , in which the source of the means is given in particular .
the recei@@ pts from any transaction loan can be used for expenses in the currency of the recipient country , or for goods or services , which are produced ( ii ) in developing countries which are members of the organization and which , according to what the administrator has specified at the time of loan granted , could be a recipient of a transaction loan .
capital rep@@ ay@@ ments of a transaction loan are eff@@ ected on the transaction account , and the amount paid in this way in the currency of a member state shall be transferred from the administrator to the Member State as soon as possible .
the car@@ et@@ aker teaches the EEC of the projects and programmes approved by the directors until the completion of all the transaction loans , which are in preparation for the inspection by the directors .
during the period of the withdrawal of the transaction loans , the Administrator informs the EEC on a quarterly basis on the development of the transaction &apos;s loans and the expendi@@ tures made for this .
the administrator transm@@ its the EEC as soon as possible after completion of the financial year of the organization a detailed billing of the transaction accounts with a statement from the external audi@@ tor of the organization to this account statement .
after full payment of the transaction loans , the administrator of the EEC shall submit a detailed report on the projects and programs financed by the Special Trade account as soon as possible .
the administrator creates and performs appropriate records and invo@@ ices from which the contributions to the special transaction account , the amounts paid to the account and the amounts paid out of the account and the payments received from the account , are apparent to the Member States .
the EEC and the administrators work closely to achieve the objectives of this agreement .
to this end , the EEC ( represented by the Commission of the European Communities ) and the administrator until the full issue of the funds of the Special Trade account from time to time have an exchange of ideas about the status of the Special Trade Rep@@ os@@ it@@ ory , the progress of the programmes or projects financed by special transactions and about all other issues affecting the provisions of this agreement .
if this agreement was not entered into force on 31 December 1978 , or at a later date agreed by the EEC and the Organization , the agreement and all the obligations of the parties with immediate effect shall be invalid .
if the total amount of capital received by the recipi@@ ents is ref@@ unded in accordance with Article II Section 8 of this Agreement and referred back to the Member States , this agreement and all the obligations of the parties resulting there@@ from are termin@@ ated with immediate effect .
this agreement requires approval from the individual Member States and the EEC in accordance with the proced@@ ural provisions of each party .
the governments of the Member States have notified the Sec@@ retariat of the Council of the European Communities to conclude the proceedings related to them .
the Secretary @-@ General dischar@@ ges these noti@@ fications along with a Noti@@ fication on the proper authorization of this agreement by the EEC to the organization .
this agreement is effective and enters into force on the first day of the month following the date of receipt of the a@@ forem@@ en@@ tioned notification in the organization .
this agreement is written in two documents in Danish , German , English , French , Italian and Dutch languages , whereby each word is equally binding .
whereas the agreement in the form of a letter to change the Anne@@ x A of Protocol No. 1 to the agreement between the European Economic Community and the Swiss Con@@ federation ( 1 ) is to be concluded - H@@ AS F@@ OL@@ LO@@ W@@ ING EQU@@ IP@@ MENT :
between the European Atom@@ ic Energy Community and the Swiss Con@@ federation in the area of controlled nuclear fusion and plasma physics
the EURO@@ PE@@ AN atomic community , herein@@ after called &quot; Eur@@ atom , &quot; represented by the Commission of the European Communities , herein@@ after called &quot; Commission , &quot;
and DIE SCH@@ WEI@@ Z@@ ER@@ ISCHE E@@ id@@ gen@@ ossen@@ schaft , herein@@ after called &quot; Switzerland , &quot; represented by the Swiss Federal Council , herein@@ after called &quot; Federal Council , &quot;
this program includes the creation of a large pilot plant , the project JET ( Joint European Tor@@ us ) , whose construction and operation are transferred to a common enterprise according to chapter V of the Eur@@ atom Treaty - herein@@ after referred to as the &quot; Common Enterprise JET . &quot;
Switzerland has been involved in research work in the area of controlled nuclear fusion and plasma physics for several years and is very familiar with the area concerned .
since even extensive work has to be carried out until the practical use of controlled nuclear fusion , it is in the interest of the contracting parties of the present agreement to consoli@@ date their respective efforts and accelerate their respective research , which has attained a higher priority due to the energy crisis .
this agreement will enable each contracting party to gain the greatest possible benefit by combining its research efforts in the field of controlled nuclear fusion and plasma physics from the funds provided for the mutual research work , i.e. the cost @-@ to @-@ competitive electricity generation by using the controlled fusion reaction to achieve faster .
to achieve the objective of the present agreement , the contracting parties associate their respective research programmes defined in Anne@@ x I and II of this agreement , herein@@ after referred to as &quot; Eur@@ atom Programme &quot; and &quot; Swiss Programme . &quot;
to ensure effective cooperation , the Swiss programme takes over the long @-@ term goals and forms of cooperation between the Eur@@ atom program ; it will be extended or am@@ ended by the organs mentioned in Articles 5 @-@ 10 and Article 16 of the present agreement that it may include new activities relevant to the Eur@@ atom program .
each time the contracting parties adopt a new program , this will occur to the programs listed in Anne@@ x I and II to the present agreement .
the association provided in paragraph 1 is realized by : - appropriate participation of each of the contracting parties during the preparation and execution of the programmes of the other party ;
- The exchange of personnel under the relevant laboratories in the Eur@@ atom countries , in Switzerland and in the third countries , with whom Eur@@ atom has concluded a similar deal as the present agreement , herein@@ after referred to as &quot; associated &quot; third states , &quot; as well as the laboratories which work on the Eur@@ atom program ;
- Mut@@ ual right to access the scientific and technical results of each program .
within the scope of the present agreement , Switzerland is participating in the JET project .
with regard to the association provided in Article 2 Section 1 of this agreement , the contracting parties close an association agreement , herein@@ after referred to as &quot; Association Agreement , &quot; referred to as &quot; Associ@@ ated Organ@@ s &quot; between the Commission and the States , or individuals , herein@@ after referred to as &quot; Associ@@ ated Organ@@ s &quot; with regard to the implementation of the Eur@@ atom program .
with the same objective , Eur@@ atom is concerned that Switzerland is involved in the agreement on personnel exchange between the Commission and the Associ@@ ated Organ@@ s at the time of the entry into force of the present agreement , which is concluded between the Commission and the associated institutions .
with regard to the participation in the JET project , Switzerland is a member of the joint venture JET , whose by@@ laws they accept with the time of the implementation of the present agreement .
Eur@@ atom is also concerned that Switzerland can become a contracting party of any contract whose objective is within the framework of the present agreement , except association agreements or other similar contracts concluded by Eur@@ atom during the period of validity of the present agreement .
the organs involved in the implementation of the association provided in Article 2 Section 1 of the present agreement are described in Articles 5 to 10 of this agreement and in the Association Agreement .
the association agreement will particularly include setting up a steering committee , the representative of the Commission and the Council of the Federation .
- To monitor the development of the research work and to direct it in such a way that the best possible results are achieved in line with the objectives of this agreement .
Switzerland is represented by a maximum of two delegates in the connection group established as part of the Eur@@ atom program - herein@@ after called &quot; VG . &quot;
the VG , which has to ensure the exchange of information and cooperation in all matters relating to ongoing or planned programmes and activities in the area of Eur@@ atom program , perc@@ ei@@ ves this task in respect of all research and development activities per@@ taining to this agreement .
in particular , it promotes the cooperation and coordination between the associated organs and alig@@ ns its strengths in the interest of the two contracting parties to the common objective set out in Eur@@ atom and in Article 1 of the present agreement , taking into account the scientific and technological developments emerging in the world .
according to its Rules of Proced@@ ure , the VG ap@@ points one or more Swiss representatives in the couns@@ elling groups created within the Eur@@ atom program whenever the competent Swiss authorities are seeking .
the consulting groups that the VG research suggested in view that the funds granted for the Eur@@ atom program will provide the best possible scientific results , take this task in view of all research and development work that is referred to in this agreement .
Switzerland is represented in the committee of directors of one of the laboratories involved in the Eur@@ atom program .
the Committee of Directors , who has over@@ seen the implementation of the Eur@@ atom program and is responsible for the fact that the capacities of the laboratories , which are involved in the work carried out in the framework of the programme , will be optimally used for all research and development work that fall under the present agreement .
it provides in particular for the best possible use of the personnel and for the exchange of the same between the laboratories involved in the implementation of the Eur@@ atom program and the Swiss programme .

the co @-@ ordination Committ@@ ees , which provide suitable proposals for the best use of the funds , personnel and knowledge and capabilities of the laboratories involved in the implementation of the Eur@@ atom program , carry out this task in the respective field with regard to all research and development work which fall under the present agreement .
the BA@@ F includes one responsible for the core and energy research of each member state of Eur@@ atom , Switzerland and any associated third country .
at the request of the Commission , the BA@@ F advis@@ es the Commission with regard to the implementation of the programme and the changes in the exec@@ utions and the preparation of future programmes and setting up their total scope , coordination and integration of national activities at Community level in the area of the merger .
the statements of the Federal Administ@@ rative Committee , the Administ@@ rative Committee , the Advisory Group and the Co @-@ ordination Committ@@ ees have a consult@@ ative character .
the VG attitude to the urgent actions is compulsory ; the same applies to the committee of directors in the area of personnel inter@@ change .
the representatives of the two contracting parties will work on the work of all technical advisory committees or all administrative bodies created for the purpose of the present agreement .
the financial contribution of Switzerland to the Eur@@ atom program in accordance with this agreement is set annually to an amount that is disp@@ uted to the Eur@@ atom program at the cost of Eur@@ atom program as the gross domestic product of Switzerland on the whole gross domestic product of Eur@@ atom and Switzerland last year .
regarding the JET project , this financial contribution applies to the stake in Eur@@ atom on the common undertaking as soon as it is constructed .
moreover , Switzerland in@@ stru@@ cts an amount to the Common Companies JET , which is determined according to the rules of the Stat@@ utes of this Common Market .
the financial contribution which Eur@@ atom contributes to the financing of the work within the association agreement and the agreement on personnel sharing is calculated on the same basis that normally serves to calculate Eur@@ atom contributions to finance the work carried out on the basis of the corresponding contracts .
the Commission will inform the Federal Council at the beginning of the year , which will amount to cover expendi@@ tures as part of the Eur@@ atom program for the year concerned .
the Federal Council shall pay the commission to the amount due to this article as follows : 7 / 12 before the 15 January and 5 / 12 before the 15 .

any contracting party may termin@@ ate this agreement at any time , subject to compliance with a period of six months .
in the form of a letter to change the agreement between the European Economic Community and the Swiss Con@@ federation
in addition , in order to simplify the proceedings for the adaptation of customs tari@@ ff names in the event of renewed changes to the customs tari@@ ff of one of the contracting parties in the future , it is also indicated in the agreement to record an article 12 to the agreement .
I honor you to confirm the consent of the Community concerning these changes , and propose to you as an appointment for entry into force 1 January 1978 .
I would be grateful if you would confirm the approval of your government to the prot@@ est@@ ant .
I honor you to confirm receipt of your present letter with the following wording :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I would be grateful if you would confirm the approval of your government to the prot@@ est@@ ant . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
agreement in the form of a correspondence between the European Economic Community and the Bank for International Sett@@ lements on mobil@@ ising the demands of the Member States during the medium @-@ term financial support
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the BIS could close stand@@ by credit agreements with the banks of credi@@ tor countries if the banks make a corresponding application . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the agreements may be closed up to the total amount of the contribution paid by the credi@@ tor to the Mechan@@ ism mechanism , within a total limit of € 2.@@ 7@@ 25 billion ; this corresponds to 50 % of all future supply bonds of the member countries .
however , some conditions have already been mentioned below , for which the BIS would be prepared .
with each stand @-@ by @-@ loan , the BIS initially would assume an obligation for two years , with the possibility of with@@ standing extensions , but without a total of five years .
at the opening of the credits and for the extension of the loan , the BIS would charge a loan opening commission .
in addition , it would be agreed that the first draws will not be made before the end of a month after conclusion of the Stand@@ by agreement so that the Bank can make the necessary adjustments to its own liquidity .
the drawing dies would take place in the currencies available to the BIS at the conclusion of the agreement , most likely in US dollars ; they would extend to time intervals which would be negoti@@ ated taking into account the funds of the bank , presum@@ ably three or six months .
the conditions would correspond to those transactions which the BIS did at the time under similar conditions , i.e. interest rates would largely correspond to market rates .
if the BIS does not have to proc@@ ure the necessary means on the market itself , then the interest rate coming to the application could reach a maximum , which corresponds to the Li@@ bor increased by a corresponding margin .
I would be grateful if you would like to inform me about the approval of the Council of the European Communities .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the BIS could close stand@@ by credit agreements with the banks of credi@@ tor countries if the banks make a corresponding application . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I would be grateful if you would share with me the approval of the Council of the European Communities to this end . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I am pleased to give you the consent of the Council of the European Communities to the content of this letter .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the conviction that stronger international cooperation should be carried out in such a way that greater liber@@ alisation , stability and expansion in international trade with meat and living animals is contributed ; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
to avoid serious distur@@ ban@@ ces in international trade with beef and living cattle ;
in the KNO@@ W@@ ING of the importance of producing beef and living cattle and trading with these products for the economy of many countries , especially of certain developed countries and developing countries ;
remember their obligations in terms of the principles and goals of the general customs and trade agreement - herein@@ after called &quot; General Agreement &quot; or &quot; GAT@@ T &quot; ( 1 ) ;
determined to implement the principles and objectives in the pursu@@ it of the objectives of this agreement , which were agreed in the Tokyo Declaration of September 14 , 1973 concerning the Multi@@ lateral trade negotiations , in particular with regard to the special and more favourable treatment of developing countries -
the objectives of this agreement are , 1 . the extension , ever further liber@@ alization and stability of the international meat and livestock market by facilit@@ ating the progressive removal of barriers and restrictions in world trade with beef and living cattle including measures to promote the division of this trade , and by enhancing the international framework of world trade for the benefit of consumers and producers , as well as import and export countries ;
2 . to encourage greater international cooperation in all issues of trade with beef and living cattle , especially with regard to greater ration@@ alisation and more effective distribution of resources in the international meat industry ;
3 . for the foreign trade of developing countries with beef and living cattle , additional benefits are to be ensured by the following measures to improve the opportunities to participate in the expansion of world trade with these products : a ) Promot@@ ing long @-@ term price stability within the framework of an expanding world market for beef and living cattle and
( B ) promoting the maintenance and improvement of the proceeds of beef and living cattle exec@@ uting developing countries ,

any contracting party may limit the application of this Convention on re@@ agents of human origin to the Blood Group determination by signing this Convention or when it comes to the signing of its rati@@ fication , approval or accession certificate .
the declaration may be with@@ drawn at any time by a Noti@@ fication addressed to the Secretary General of the Council of Europe .
the contracting parties undertake to leave re@@ agents for the determination of the costs of their extraction , preparation and transport and , if necessary , the purchase price of other contractual parties , which are in urgent need of them , provided that they themselves have sufficient supplies for their own needs .
re@@ agents for the determination of blood type are provided by other contracting parties only on condition that no profit is associated with it , that they are only used for medical purposes and can only be supplied to places designated by the governments involved .
any sending of re@@ agents to the blood type determination is to be accompanied by a certificate made according to the regulations of the protocol .
the Protocol and its system constitute an administrative agreement that may be am@@ ended or am@@ ended by the governments of the parties to this Convention .
the Parties shall take all necessary measures to free the re@@ agents made available to them by other contracting parties in order to determine the blood type determination of all input charges .
furthermore , they take all necessary measures to ensure that these substances reach the recipi@@ ents recorded in Article 3 quickly and in the shortest possible way .
the Parties shall submit a list of places provided for the issu@@ ance of the certificate provided in Article 4 by the Secretary @-@ General of the Council of Europe .
these bodies should be identical with the places designated in Article 6 of the European Convention on the exchange of therapeutic substances of human origin .
this Convention is signed for the members of the Council of Europe for signing ; they may become a contracting party by signing it a ) without reservation of rati@@ fication or approval or
this Convention enters into force one month after the day in which three members of the Council have signed or rati@@ fied it according to Article 7 without prior approval of rati@@ fication or approval .
for any member that has signed or rati@@ fied this Convention later without reservation of rati@@ fication or approval , it enters into force one month after its signature or the deposit of the rati@@ fication or approval certificate .
after the entry into force of this Convention , the Council of Ministers of the Council of Europe may invite any non @-@ member state to join the Convention .
the Secretary @-@ General of the Council of Europe noti@@ fies the members of the Council and the Member States a ) the time of entry into force of this Convention and the names of the members who have signed or rati@@ fied it without reservation of rati@@ fication or approval ;
each contracting party may termin@@ ate this Convention , subject to compliance with a period of one year , by noti@@ fying the Secretary General of the Council of Europe .
a re@@ agent for blood type determination must react with all tested blood samples that contain the an@@ tigen which is hom@@ olo@@ g to the antibody or another substance stated on the label .
if a re@@ agent is used in the manner recommended by the manufacturer , the following factors or phenomena may not occur : a ) hem@@ oly@@ tic properties ;
the ti@@ ter is measured twice in a suitable medium by di@@ lution of the re@@ agent to be examined .
the ti@@ ter is the reci@@ pro@@ cal value of the number of strongest ser@@ um di@@ lution in which a reaction occurs ; di@@ lution is calculated excluding the volume of blood cell in@@ undation in the total volume .
for anti @-@ A , anti @-@ b or other re@@ agents used on object carriers , activity is expressed through time required for ag@@ glut@@ ination on an object carrier .
the World Health Organisation has set up International Standards for Anti @-@ A and Anti @-@ B as well as in@@ complete anti @-@ D re@@ agents and for re@@ agents of other specific@@ ity are elabor@@ ated at present standards .
according to the definition , an international standard preparation contains a certain number of international units per mg or ml , and this definition is independent of the ti@@ ters which are observed in individual preparations of red blood cells ( 1 ) .
( 1 ) The effectiveness of re@@ agents to determine the blood type determination of most specific@@ ities is expressed as ag@@ glut@@ in@@ ation@@ sti@@ ter , which is observed in a series of di@@ lu@@ tions in er@@ y@@ thro@@ cy@@ te in@@ undation .
the ti@@ ter speci@@ fies the di@@ lution of the re@@ agent in the last mixture within a series at which a microsc@@ opic visible ag@@ glut@@ ination occurs .
the effectiveness of re@@ agents for blood type determination , for which international standard preparations are present ( currently Anti @-@ A and Anti @-@ B as well as in@@ complete anti @-@ D ) , can be expressed on the basis of the ti@@ tration of the unknown re@@ agent in international units ( see Bul@@ letin WHO O@@ MS 1954 , 10 , 9@@ 37 , 9@@ 41 - 1950 , 3 , 301 . ) .
if you bring them back to a volume of 1 ml , the Anti @-@ A and Anti @-@ B S@@ hear according to definition 256 International units per ml .
the preparations are available free of charge from the International Laboratory for Bi@@ ological Standards of the World Health Organization , Stat@@ ens Ser@@ um Institute , Copenhagen .
the following table shows an example of a comparable ti@@ tration of the International Standard ser@@ um Anti @-@ A ( S ) and an &quot; unknown &quot; anti @-@ A re@@ agent ( U ) against red blood cells A1 and red blood cells A@@ 2B . &gt; PI@@ C FI@@ LE = &quot; T@@ 00@@ 450@@ 83 &quot; &gt;
if a re@@ agent is stored under the conditions recommended by the manufacturer , its required properties shall remain for at least one year .
the exp@@ iry date of a re@@ agent in a fluid form according to the label is at most one year after the last satisfactory efficacy test .
the ex@@ piration date indicated on the label for dry re@@ agents depends on the results of the durability tests ; it is appro@@ achable by the state supervisory authorities .
dry re@@ agents are stored in an atmosphere of in@@ ert gas or in a vacuum , in the glass container in which they have been dried and which is so closed that no moisture can enter .
a dry re@@ agent may lose at most 0.5 per cent of its weight if it is tested by further drying over phosph@@ or pent@@ oxide at a pressure of not more than 0.0@@ 2 mm Hg within 24 hours .
to prevent bacterial growth , the competent state authority can determine that the re@@ agent ( or the solv@@ ents supplied with the dry re@@ agents ) can be added to an anti@@ sep@@ tic and / or antibiotic , provided that the re@@ agent with the added substance continues to provide the requirements for specific@@ ity and effectiveness .
sera human origin for blood group determination must contain at least 2.5 mg of protein per ml flu@@ ffy or re @-@ dissolved ser@@ um .
re@@ agents , regardless of whether in a fluid form or after re @-@ release , must be transparent and must neither contain sedi@@ ments nor gels or visible particles .
the re@@ agents for the international exchange of blood type determination should not be arti@@ fici@@ ally colored , at least until an international agreement reached a unified system .
re@@ agents for blood type determination are to be distributed in such a way that the re@@ agent located in a container is not only sufficient to carry out tests with the unknown blood cells , but also to carry out tests with positive and negative control blood cells .
the quantity in a container must be so large that the content may be used to carry out the effectiveness tests described in this protocol .
the manufacturing laboratory has written records of all stages of production and control of re@@ agents to determine blood type determination .
adequate samples of all re@@ agents are stored for a long time from the laboratory until it is prob@@ able that the Char@@ ge is no longer used .
the re@@ agents used for blood type determination may contain substances of human , animal , plant ( or mineral ) origin ; some of these represent the effective proportion , the others are the necessary aids to strengthen the effectiveness and maintain the stability of the re@@ agent .
for technical reasons these re@@ agents are classified according to the origin of their effective part into three groups .
this does not mean that the re@@ agents of human origin contain only substances of human origin or that animal or plant re@@ agents cannot contain any substances of human origin .
each container is a black on white printed label in English and French , containing the following information : 1 . name and address of the manufacturer ,
4. the quantity or , with dried re@@ agents , the amount and composition of the liquid needed for re@@ plen@@ ishment ,
in addition , this label or label on the box in which the individual containers are located or the instructions attached to the containers must contain the following information : 1 . full name and address of the manufacturer ,
3. the amount or , with dried re@@ agents , the amount and composition of the liquid needed for re@@ plen@@ ishment ,
each shipment must be accompanied by a certificate according to Article 4 of the Convention according to the system to this protocol .

some &quot; in@@ complete &quot; ser@@ a ag@@ glut@@ in@@ ate on object carriers also hom@@ olog@@ ous red blood cells washed in their own ser@@ um or plasma .
the following requirements for the effectiveness of Ser@@ a to determine the R@@ h group are possibly to change if International standard preparations are available . i ) Anti @-@ D ( anti @-@ Rh@@ o ) blood group ser@@ um ( human )
anti @-@ D ser@@ um is obtained from the blood of one or more people who are immun@@ ised by the An@@ tigen D of the R@@ h system .
