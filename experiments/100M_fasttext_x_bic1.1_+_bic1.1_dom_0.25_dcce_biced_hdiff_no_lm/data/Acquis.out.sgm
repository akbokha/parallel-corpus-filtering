<seg id="729">Between the European Economic Community (EEC) and its Member States Belgium, Denmark, Federal Republic of Germany, France, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, United Kingdom (Member States) on the one hand and the International Development Organisation (Organisation) on the other</seg>
<seg id="730">The EEC has decided to contribute to the special action programme specified at the Conference on International Economic Cooperation in order to help meet the immediate needs of individual countries with low incomes, whose development is hampered by common resource-related problems.</seg>
<seg id="731">C) It is the objective of the EEC and the Member States that the entire contribution of the Member States is bound within six months of entering into force of the agreement and as far as possible within two years after entry into force in the form of loans, and the organization will do its utmost to achieve this goal.</seg>
<seg id="732">D) The EEC and the Organization have consulted each other on the proposed implementation and administration of this agreement and the intermediate ties to ensure a broad and balanced geographical distribution within the framework of this agreement.</seg>
<seg id="733">To this end, the organization of the EEC has presented a table showing how it intends to apply the criteria laid down in this agreement -</seg>
<seg id="734">The organization establishes a special account under the term "transaction account" which consists of the funds which the Member States contribute to the transaction account in accordance with this Agreement; this account is referred to as Administrator by the Organization (hereinafter referred to as "Administrator"), and only to the purpose specified in this Agreement, and in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement.</seg>
<seg id="735">The transaction account is seperated separately and separated from all other accounts and assets of the organization.</seg>
<seg id="736">The contributions are to be paid as follows: a) Payment is made in the form of cash or non-interest debits of the member state, which shall be deposited on demand in the currency of the concerned state at order of the organization as the administrator of the special transaction account and to be deposited with the organization in the country concerned.</seg>

<seg id="739">C) Any Member State may, upon request, make payments before the aforementioned dates.</seg>
<seg id="740">According to the usual procedure of the organization, the steward assumes approximately proportional concertina drawing on the cash or the Notes, in order to cover the expenses for the transaction loans and to balance the special transaction account in a reasonable way.</seg>
<seg id="741">When granting these loans, the administrator can be guided by the following factors in accordance with the terms of the EEC:</seg>
<seg id="742">(III) to the extent that international economic factors contributed to the country's current and foreseeable economic problems;</seg>
<seg id="743">(VI) the composition and the tendency of the country's debt service and its further capacity for lending to loan conditions without discount; and</seg>
<seg id="744">VII) the extent to which the problems of the respective countries are regulated by contributions from other sources.</seg>
<seg id="745">Any transaction loan serves to finance a clearly defined and rapidly payable development program or project (including a sectoral project), irrespective of whether it is part of the organization's lending programme or not, according to the procedures and practices applied to the organization funded by the organization (letter b) of the preamble to this agreement.</seg>
<seg id="746">The funds of the transaction account may not be used instead of ordinary funds of the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (Bank) or the Organization, which are bound in the context of a loan or credit for a program or project which has already been approved by the directors of the Bank or the Organization on the day of the entry into force.</seg>

<seg id="749">Amounts for payment of this clock have to be paid directly to the organisation they retain.</seg>
<seg id="750">Any transaction loan is to be identified by a separate loan agreement between the recipient country and the administrator, in which the source of the means is given in particular.</seg>
<seg id="751">The receipts from any transaction loan can be used for expenses in the currency of the recipient country, or for goods or services, which are produced (ii) in developing countries which are members of the organization and which, according to what the administrator has specified at the time of loan granted, could be a recipient of a transaction loan.</seg>
<seg id="752">Capital repayments of a transaction loan are effected on the transaction account, and the amount paid in this way in the currency of a member state shall be transferred from the administrator to the Member State as soon as possible.</seg>
<seg id="753">The caretaker teaches the EEC of the projects and programmes approved by the directors until the completion of all the transaction loans, which are in preparation for the inspection by the directors.</seg>
<seg id="754">During the period of the withdrawal of the transaction loans, the Administrator informs the EEC on a quarterly basis on the development of the transaction's loans and the expenditures made for this.</seg>
<seg id="755">The administrator transmits the EEC as soon as possible after completion of the financial year of the organization a detailed billing of the transaction accounts with a statement from the external auditor of the organization to this account statement.</seg>
<seg id="756">After full payment of the transaction loans, the administrator of the EEC shall submit a detailed report on the projects and programs financed by the Special Trade account as soon as possible.</seg>
<seg id="757">The administrator creates and performs appropriate records and invoices from which the contributions to the special transaction account, the amounts paid to the account and the amounts paid out of the account and the payments received from the account, are apparent to the Member States.</seg>
<seg id="758">The EEC and the administrators work closely to achieve the objectives of this agreement.</seg>
<seg id="759">To this end, the EEC (represented by the Commission of the European Communities) and the administrator until the full issue of the funds of the Special Trade account from time to time have an exchange of ideas about the status of the Special Trade Repository, the progress of the programmes or projects financed by special transactions and about all other issues affecting the provisions of this agreement.</seg>

<seg id="851">The agreements may be closed up to the total amount of the contribution paid by the creditor to the Mechanism mechanism, within a total limit of €2.725 billion; this corresponds to 50% of all future supply bonds of the member countries.</seg>
<seg id="852">However, some conditions have already been mentioned below, for which the BIS would be prepared.</seg>
<seg id="853">With each stand-by-loan, the BIS initially would assume an obligation for two years, with the possibility of withstanding extensions, but without a total of five years.</seg>
<seg id="854">At the opening of the credits and for the extension of the loan, the BIS would charge a loan opening commission.</seg>
<seg id="855">In addition, it would be agreed that the first draws will not be made before the end of a month after conclusion of the Standby agreement so that the Bank can make the necessary adjustments to its own liquidity.</seg>
<seg id="856">The drawing dies would take place in the currencies available to the BIS at the conclusion of the agreement, most likely in US dollars; they would extend to time intervals which would be negotiated taking into account the funds of the bank, presumably three or six months.</seg>
<seg id="857">The conditions would correspond to those transactions which the BIS did at the time under similar conditions, i.e. interest rates would largely correspond to market rates.</seg>
