it is available as 5 mg , 10 mg , 15 mg and 30 mg tablets , as 10 mg , 15 mg and 30 mg of melt tablets ( tablets that dissolve in the mouth ) , as a solution for taking ( 1 mg / ml ) and as an injection solution ( 7.5 mg / ml ) .
B. enter@@ tain thinking and speaking , hall@@ u@@ cin@@ ations ( hearing or seeing things that are not present ) , di@@ str@@ ust and del@@ usions ; • Bi@@ polar @-@ I distur@@ b@@ ance , a mental disorder where patients may have man@@ ic epis@@ odes ( periods of abnormal high spirits ) alter@@ nat@@ ely with periods of normal mood .
AB@@ I@@ LI@@ F@@ Y is used to treat moderate to severe man@@ ic epis@@ odes and to prevent man@@ ic epis@@ odes in patients who have responded to the medicine in the past .
the injection solution is used to quickly control disturbed rest@@ lessness or behavi@@ our@@ al disorders if the oral intake of the medicine is not possible .
in both diseases , the solution to inhal@@ ation or the melting tablets in patients can be applied to which the swal@@ lowing of tablets causes difficulties .
in patients who take other medicines at the same time , which are broken down as well as A@@ bili@@ fy , the dose of A@@ bili@@ fy should be adjusted .
this interfer@@ es with the signal transmission between brain cells by &quot; neur@@ ot@@ ran@@ smit@@ ters , &quot; i.e. chemical substances that enable communication between nerve cells among each other .
Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol is thought to be &quot; partial ag@@ onal &quot; for recept@@ ors for neur@@ ot@@ ran@@ smit@@ ters dop@@ amine and 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amine ( also called ser@@ oton@@ in ) .
this means that ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol such as 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amine and dop@@ amine , but to a lesser extent , acts as the neur@@ ot@@ ran@@ sm@@ itter to activate the recept@@ ors .
since dop@@ amine and 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amin play a role in schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar disorder , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol helps norm@@ alize the brain activity , which reduces psych@@ otic or man@@ ic symptoms and prevents their re@@ occurrence .
the effectiveness of AB@@ I@@ LI@@ F@@ Y , the re@@ occurrence of symptoms , was examined in three studies of up to one year .
the efficacy of the injection solution was compared in two studies in 80@@ 5 patients with schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia or similar diseases which were suffering from increased ag@@ itation over a period of two hours with plac@@ ebo .
in another study , A@@ bili@@ fy was compared over twelve weeks to 3@@ 47 patients with hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol , in another study the effectiveness of A@@ bili@@ fy and plac@@ ebo to prevent re@@ occurring to 160 patients in which the man@@ ic symptoms had already been stabil@@ ised with AB@@ I@@ LI@@ F@@ Y .
the effectiveness of A@@ bili@@ fy injection solution was compared in a study involving 301 patients with bi@@ polar disorder , which suffered from increased un@@ rest with which of Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am ( another anti@@ psych@@ otic ) and plac@@ ebo over a period of two hours .
all studies examined the change in the symptoms of patients using a standard scale for bi@@ polar disorder or the number of patients who responded to the treatment .
the company also carried out studies to investigate how the body absor@@ bs the melting tablets and the solution to inhal@@ ation .
in both studies with the injection solution , patients who received A@@ bili@@ fy in doses of 5.@@ 25 mg , 9.@@ 75 mg or 15 mg showed a significantly stronger reduction in the symptoms of increased rest@@ lessness than the patients receiving a plac@@ ebo .
in the application to treat bi@@ polar disorder , A@@ bili@@ fy reduced man@@ ic symptoms more effectively than plac@@ ebo in four of the five short @-@ term studies .
for up to 74 weeks , AB@@ I@@ LI@@ F@@ Y prevented the recur@@ rence of man@@ ic epis@@ odes in previously treated patients and if it was administered in addition to an existing treatment .
AB@@ I@@ LI@@ F@@ Y injec@@ tions in 10 or 15 mg doses also reduced more effective than plac@@ ebo the symptoms of increased rest@@ lessness and were similarly effective as Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am .
the most common side effects of AB@@ I@@ LI@@ F@@ Y ( observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are extra@@ py@@ ra@@ mid@@ al distur@@ ban@@ ces ( un@@ controll@@ able stain@@ ing ) , se@@ dation ( dro@@ w@@ sin@@ ess ) , nausea , vom@@ iting ( con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation ) , s@@ ali@@ va ( increased s@@ ali@@ va ) , fatigue and exhaus@@ tion , rest@@ lessness , in@@ som@@ nia ( sleep disorders ) and anxiety .
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that the advantages of A@@ bili@@ fy in the treatment of schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia and from medium to severe man@@ ic epis@@ odes in bi@@ polar I disorder and in preventing a new man@@ ic episode in patients who spoke mostly man@@ ic epis@@ odes and in which the man@@ ic epis@@ odes were respon@@ ding to the treatment with ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , compared with the risks .
in addition , the committee came to the conclusion that the advantages of the injection solution during rapid control of increased rest@@ lessness and behavi@@ our@@ al disorders in patients with schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia or in patients with epis@@ odes in bi@@ polar I disorder , if oral therapy is not suitable , out@@ weigh the risks .
in June 2004 , the European Commission granted its approval to the company Ot@@ su@@ ka Pharmaceu@@ tical Europe Ltd. for the transport of A@@ bili@@ fy throughout the European Union .
AB@@ I@@ LI@@ F@@ Y is indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe man@@ ic epis@@ odes of bi@@ polar disorder and for the prevention of a new man@@ ic episode in patients who had mostly man@@ ic epis@@ odes and their man@@ ic epis@@ odes responded to the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol ( see Section 5.1 ) .
the recommended starting dose for A@@ bili@@ fy is 10 or 15 mg / day at a maintenance dose of 15 mg / day once daily regardless of meals .
increased effectiveness in dos@@ ages over a daily dose of 15 mg was not proven , although individual patients can benefit from a higher dose .
the recommended starting dose for A@@ bili@@ fy is 15 mg once daily , irrespective of meals as mon@@ otherapy or combination therapy ( see Section 5.1 ) .
the effectiveness of A@@ bili@@ fy in the treatment of schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar disorder in patients ≥ 65 years has not been proven .
in consideration of the greater sensitivity of this group of patients , a lower initial dose should be considered when clinical factors justify this ( see section 4.4 ) .
if the CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 @-@ induc@@ tor is removed from the combination therapy , the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol dose should be reduced to the recommended dose ( see Section 4.5 ) .
the occurrence of su@@ ici@@ dal behavior belongs to psych@@ otic diseases and aff@@ ective disorders and was reported in some cases after the beginning or after the change of an anti@@ psych@@ otic therapy , also in the treatment with ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol ( see section 4.8 ) .
results of an epide@@ mi@@ ological study showed that in patients with bi@@ polar disorder there was no increased su@@ ici@@ dal risk associated with ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole compared to other anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics .
Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol should be used with care in patients with well @-@ known cardiovascular diseases ( m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction or isch@@ em@@ ic heart disease , con@@ ges@@ tive heart failure , hyper@@ tension ) , cereb@@ rov@@ ascular disease , hypo@@ vol@@ emia , treatment with blood pressure lowering drugs ) or hyper@@ tension ( including acute and mal@@ ign@@ ant form ) .
3 late dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia : in clinical studies lasting one year or less , there were occasional reports of dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia occurring during the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol .
if signs and symptoms of late dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia occur in a patient treated with A@@ bili@@ fy , it should be considered to reduce the dose or break the treatment .
if a patient has developed signs and symptoms that point to a M@@ NS , or un@@ clear high fever without an additional clinical manifestation of M@@ NS , all anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics , including A@@ bili@@ fy , must be dismis@@ sed .
therefore ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol should be used with caution in patients with sei@@ zur@@ es in the an@@ am@@ n@@ esis or at states associated with sei@@ zur@@ es .
56 - 99 years ) with ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in patients with psycho@@ sis associated with Alzheimer &apos;s disease , patients treated with ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole had an increased risk of death compared to plac@@ ebo .
however , there were in one of these studies , a fixed dose study , a significant relationship between the dosage and the response for unwanted cereb@@ rov@@ ascular events in patients treated with ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol .
hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia , in some cases extremely and associated with k@@ eto@@ aci@@ dosis or hyper@@ os@@ mol@@ ar coma or death , was reported in patients treated with at@@ yp@@ ical anti @-@ psych@@ otic agents , including A@@ bili@@ fy .
there are no precise risk ass@@ essments for hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia @-@ related adverse events in patients treated with A@@ bili@@ fy and other at@@ yp@@ ical anti @-@ psych@@ otic drugs to allow direct compar@@ isons .
poly@@ ph@@ onic , poly@@ ph@@ onic , poly@@ ph@@ ag@@ ia and weakness ) are observed and patients with diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus or with risk factors for diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus should regularly be monitored with regard to a deteri@@ oration of glucose levels .
weight gain is generally observed in schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ic patients and in patients with bi@@ polar man@@ ia due to com@@ or@@ bi@@ di@@ ties , the use of anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics , in which weight gain is known as a side effect , or an un@@ healthy lifestyle and could lead to serious complications .
due to the primary effect of ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole on the central nervous system , caution is advised when ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol is taken in combination with alcohol or other central effective medicines with over@@ l@@ apping side effects such as se@@ dation ( see paragraph 4.8 ) .
the H2 @-@ antagon@@ ist fam@@ ot@@ ine , a gast@@ ric acid blo@@ cker , reduces the res@@ or@@ ption rate of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol , but this effect is not considered clin@@ ically relevant .
in a clinical study involving healthy volunteers , a highly effective CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 inhibit@@ or ( ch@@ ini@@ din ) increased the AU@@ C of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol by 107 % while c@@ max remained unchanged .
it is expected that other highly effective inhibit@@ ors of CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 , such as flu@@ ox@@ et@@ tin and par@@ ox@@ et@@ ine , have similar effects and therefore similar can reductions should be made .
CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 &apos; bad &apos; ( poor &apos; poor &apos; ) met@@ aboli@@ zation can result in the joint application with highly effective inhibit@@ ors of CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 in higher plasma concentrations of ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole compared to CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 exten@@ sive metabol@@ is@@ ers .
considering the joint administration of k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole or other highly effective CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors with AB@@ I@@ LI@@ F@@ Y , potential benefits should out@@ weigh the potential risks for the patient .
other highly effective inhibit@@ ors of CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , like it@@ ra@@ con@@ az@@ ole and HIV prot@@ e@@ as@@ ein@@ hi@@ bit@@ ors , may have similar effects and therefore similar can reductions should be made .
after setting up the CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6@@ - or 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ or , the dose of A@@ bili@@ fy should be raised to the dose height before the start of the accompanying therapy .
dil@@ ti@@ az@@ em or esc@@ ital@@ op@@ ram ) or CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 together with A@@ bili@@ fy can be attributed with a moderate increase in Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zol@@ - concentrations .
in clinical studies doses of 10 @-@ 30 mg Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole per day showed no significant effect on the metabolism of the sub@@ strates of CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 ( dex@@ tro@@ meth@@ yl@@ an / 3 @-@ metho@@ xy@@ morph@@ ine ratio ) , 2@@ C@@ 9 ( war@@ far@@ in ) , 2@@ C@@ 19 ( om@@ ep@@ hr@@ u@@ ph@@ or@@ phi@@ c ) .
patients should be advised to inform their doctor if they are pregnant or plan a pregnancy during treatment with ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole .
this drug may not be used in pregnancy because of the insufficient data situation in humans and due to the concerns raised in the animal reproductive studies , unless the potential benefit justi@@ fies the potential risk for the fo@@ etus .
however , as with other anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics , patients should be warned of using dangerous machinery , including motor vehicles , until they are certain that Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol has no negative influence on them .
the following side effects were more common ( ≥ 1 / 100 ) than plac@@ ebo or were classified as potential medi@@ cally relevant side effects ( * ) :
the frequency of the side effects listed below is defined by the following criteria : common ( &gt; 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) ; occasionally ( &gt; 1 / 1.000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) .
schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia - In a controlled long @-@ term study of 52 weeks , patients treated with ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole included a total lower incidence ( 25.@@ 8 % ) of EPS including par@@ kin@@ son@@ ism , Ak@@ ath@@ isie , d@@ yst@@ onia and dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia , compared to patients treated with hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol ( 5@@ 7.3 % ) .
in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled long @-@ term study for 26 weeks , the incidence of EPS grew 19 % in patients under ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole treatment and 13.@@ 1 % in patients under plac@@ ebo .
in another controlled long @-@ term study over 26 weeks , the incidence of EPS 14.@@ 8 % in patients treated with ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole was 15.@@ 1 % in patients with ap@@ lan@@ ap@@ ine therapy .
man@@ ic epis@@ odes in bi@@ polar I disorder - In a controlled study of 12 weeks , the incidence of EPS 23,@@ 5 % in patients under ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zol@@ - treatment and 5@@ 3.3 % in patients with hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol treatment .
in another study over 12 weeks , the incidence of EPS 26.@@ 6 % in patients with ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole treatment and 17.@@ 6 % for those under lithium treatment .
in the long @-@ term maintenance phase for 26 weeks in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled trial , the incidence of EPS 18.@@ 2 % for patients under ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zol@@ - treatment and 15.@@ 7 % for patients treated with plac@@ ebo .
a comparison between the patient groups under ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole and plac@@ ebo , in which potential clin@@ ically significant changes of routine laboratory parameters were detected , did not show any medi@@ cally significant differences .
increases in CP@@ K ( cre@@ atine @-@ ph@@ osp@@ ho@@ kin@@ ase ) , generally temporary and asy@@ mpt@@ om@@ atic , were observed in 3.5 % of patients treated with ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol , compared to 2.0 % of patients treated with plac@@ ebo .
the side effects associated with an anti@@ psych@@ otic therapy and their occurrence in the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol include mal@@ ign@@ ant neuro@@ le@@ p@@ tic syndrome , late dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia and var@@ ic@@ ose cases , unwanted cereb@@ rov@@ ascular events and increased mort@@ ality in older dementia patients , hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia and diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus ( see section 4.4 ) .
in clinical trials and since the market launch in@@ adver@@ t@@ ently or inten@@ tionally acute over@@ dos@@ ages with ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole alone were observed in adult patients with estimated doses of up to 12@@ 60 mg and without death .
although there are no information on the efficacy of a hem@@ odi@@ aly@@ sis in the treatment of an over@@ dose with ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole ; however , it is unlikely that hem@@ odi@@ aly@@ sis is beneficial in the treatment of over@@ dosing , as Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol has a high plasma protein connection .
it is thought that the efficacy of ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar I disorder is medi@@ ated by the combination of a partial antagon@@ istic effect on dop@@ amine D@@ 2- and ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 1@@ a- recept@@ ors and an antagon@@ istic effect on ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 2a recept@@ ors .
Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol showed in vitro a high aff@@ inity to the dop@@ amine D@@ 2- and D3 @-@ recep@@ tor and to the ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 1@@ a- and 5@@ HT@@ 2a @-@ recep@@ tor as well as a moderate aff@@ inity to dop@@ amine D@@ 4- , for ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 2@@ c@@ - and 5@@ HT@@ 7@@ - , to alpha @-@ 1 @-@ adren@@ ergi@@ c and to the hist@@ amine @-@ H@@ 1@@ recep@@ tor .
the posit@@ ron emission tom@@ ography showed dose @-@ dependent reduction of binding of 11@@ C @-@ Rac@@ lo@@ pri@@ d , a D2 / D3 @-@ recep@@ tor lig@@ ands , the nucle@@ us cau@@ dat@@ us and the put@@ amen for a dose of ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol in dos@@ ages of 0.5 to 30 m@@ g. once a day for more than 2 weeks .
in three plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled short @-@ term studies ( 4 to 6 weeks ) on 1,@@ 228 schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ic patients with positive or negative symptoms , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed a statisti@@ cally significant improvement in psych@@ otic symptoms compared to plac@@ ebo .
in a hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol @-@ controlled trial , 52 % of respon@@ der patients who attended study medication in week 52 were similar in both groups ( Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol 77 % and hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol 73 % ) .
current values from measuring scales which were defined as secondary study objectives including PAN@@ SS and Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery As@@ berg@@ - Dep@@ res@@ sions Rates showed a significantly stronger improvement than with hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol .
in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled study over 26 weeks in stabili@@ zed patients with chronic schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia , a significantly higher rate of recall rate was seen in Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , which was 34 % in the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole group and 57 % in the plac@@ ebo .
in a pseu@@ do @-@ controlled , multinational double @-@ blind study in schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia over 26 weeks involving 3@@ 14 patients and in which the primary study goal was &apos; weight gain &apos; , a significant reduction in weight gain of at least 7 % compared to the initial value ( i.e. an increase of at least 5.6 kg ) with an average weight of ca .
in two plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled mon@@ otherapy studies with flexible dosage over 3 weeks with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of bi@@ polar I disorder , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol showed a superior efficacy compared to plac@@ ebo in reducing man@@ ic symptoms over 3 weeks .
in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled mon@@ otherapy trial over 3 weeks with fixed dosage with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of bi@@ polar I disorder , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed no superior efficacy compared to plac@@ ebo .
in two plac@@ ebo and active @-@ controlled mon@@ otherapy studies for 12 weeks in patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of a bi@@ polar I disorder , with or without psych@@ otic features , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol showed an efficacy compared to plac@@ ebo in week 3 and a maintenance effect comparable to that of lithium or hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol in week 12 .
Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole also showed in week 12 a comparable proportion of patients with sympt@@ om@@ atic re@@ mission of the man@@ ia like lithium or hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol .
in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled study for 6 weeks with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of a bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , with or without psych@@ otic features , which partly did not apply to lithium or val@@ pro@@ at mon@@ otherapy in therapeutic ser@@ um mirrors , the companion therapy with ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole revealed an superior effectiveness in reducing man@@ ic symptoms compared to mon@@ otherapy involving lithium or val@@ pro@@ at .
10 In a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled study over 26 weeks followed by a long @-@ term enlargement phase for more than 74 weeks in man@@ ic patients who had achieved a re@@ mission with ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole during a stabil@@ isation period prior to random@@ isation , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole was superior to the prevention of a bi@@ polar return , predominantly in the prevention of a revers@@ al in the man@@ ia .
based on in vitro studies , the CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 and CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 enzymes are responsible for the dehy@@ dra@@ tion and hydro@@ xy@@ om@@ ation of ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol , the N @-@ De@@ al@@ ky@@ rie is cataly@@ sed by CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 .
the mean phase of elimination is approximately 75 hours for ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole with extensive metabol@@ ites via CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 and approximately 146 hours in poor &apos; poor &apos; ( poor &apos; ) metabolism agents using CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 .
in ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole there are no differences in pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics between male and female healthy subjects , as did pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic examination of schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ic patients with no gender dependent effects .
a selection @-@ specific evaluation for pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics did not reveal any clin@@ ically significant differences with respect to eth@@ ni@@ city &apos;s eth@@ ni@@ city or the effect of smoking on the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol .
the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic properties of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol and Deh@@ ydr@@ o @-@ Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol were similar in patients with severe ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency compared to young healthy volunteers .
a single dose study in patients with different liver cir@@ rho@@ sis ( Child @-@ Pu@@ gh Class A , B and C ) showed no significant effect regarding the impair@@ ment of liver function on the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole and Deh@@ ydr@@ o @-@ Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol , but the study included only 3 patients with class C cir@@ rho@@ sis , which is not sufficient to draw conclusions on their metabolic capacity .
based on conventional studies on safety har@@ mac@@ ology , toxic@@ ity with repeated application , reproduction toxic@@ ity , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity , and the kan@@ dic@@ ated potential , the pre@@ clinical data had no particular dangers to humans .
toxic@@ ologically significant effects were only observed in dos@@ ages or ex@@ positions that significantly exceeded the maximum dose or exposure in humans , so that they have limited or no importance for clinical application .
the effects included a dose @-@ dependent side kidney toxic@@ ity ( li@@ po@@ f@@ us@@ cin @-@ pig@@ ment @-@ accumulation and / or par@@ ench@@ y@@ mal cell loss ) in rats after 104 weeks at the recommended maximum dose in humans ) and an increase in adren@@ al rin@@ der @-@ car@@ cin@@ omas / car@@ cin@@ omas in female rats at 60 mg / kg / day ( 10 times the average ste@@ ady state exposure ( AU@@ C ) at the recommended maximum dose in humans ) .
in addition , a chol@@ eli@@ thi@@ asis was determined as a result of the precip@@ itation of sulph@@ ate con@@ jug@@ ates of the hydro@@ xy@@ - Met@@ abol@@ ites of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol in the bil@@ e of 25 to 125 mg / kg / day ( 1 to 3 times the average ste@@ ady state exposure ( AU@@ C ) at the recommended clinical dose or the 16@@ - to 8@@ 1@@ times the recommended maximum dose in humans based on mg / m2 ) .
however , at the highest recommended daily dose of 30 m@@ g. of the sulph@@ ate con@@ jug@@ ates of hydro@@ xy@@ - ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol , the concentrations found in the human bil@@ e were no more than 6 % of the concentrations found in the study for 39 weeks in the bil@@ e of monkeys , and lie far below the limit values ( 6 % ) of the in vitro sol@@ ub@@ ility .
in ra@@ bb@@ its , these effects were observed after dos@@ ages leading to ex@@ positions of 3 and 11 times the average ste@@ ady state AU@@ C at the recommended clinical maximum dose .

15 late dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia : in clinical studies lasting one year or less , there were occasional reports of dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia occurring during the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol .
it is thought that the efficacy of ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar I disorder is medi@@ ated by the combination of a partial antagon@@ istic effect on dop@@ amine D@@ 2- and ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 1@@ a- recept@@ ors and an antagon@@ istic effect on ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 2a recept@@ ors .

the recommended starting dose for ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole is 10 or 15 mg / day at a maintenance dose of 15 mg / day once daily regardless of meals .
patients who have difficulty swal@@ lowing ab@@ ili@@ fy tablets can take the melt tablets alternatively to A@@ bili@@ fy tablets ( see Section 5.2 ) .
the occurrence of su@@ ici@@ dal behavior belongs to psych@@ otic diseases and aff@@ ective disorders was reported in some cases after the beginning or after the change of an anti@@ psych@@ otic therapy , also in the treatment with ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol ( see section 4.8 ) .
late dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia : in clinical studies lasting one year or less , there were occasional reports of dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia occurring during the treatment with ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol .
clinical manifest@@ ations of a M@@ NS are high fever , muscle rigi@@ dity , changing consciousness levels and signs of autonomous inst@@ ability ( irregular pulse or blood pressure , t@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ dia , swe@@ ating and cardiac ar@@ rhyth@@ mia ) .
weight gain is generally observed in schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ic patients and in patients with bi@@ polar man@@ ia because of com@@ or@@ bi@@ di@@ ties , the use of anti @-@ psych@@ ot@@ ics , in which weight gain is known as a side effect or an un@@ healthy lifestyle and could lead to serious complications .

AB@@ I@@ LI@@ F@@ Y injection solution is used for fast control of ag@@ ility and behavi@@ our@@ al disorders in patients with schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia or in patients with epis@@ odes of bi@@ polar I disorder if oral therapy is not appropriate .
as soon as it is clin@@ ically attached , the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol injection solution should be termin@@ ated and begun with the oral application of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol .
to increase res@@ or@@ ption and minim@@ ise vari@@ ability , an injection into the M. Del@@ to@@ ide@@ us or deep into the glut@@ eus maxim@@ us muscle is recommended under circum@@ vent@@ ing adi@@ p@@ ous regions .
a lower dose of 5.@@ 25 mg ( 0.7 ml ) may be given depending on the individual clinical status taking into account the medicines currently used for maintenance or acute therapy ( see Section 4.5 ) .
if an additional oral treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol is indicated , see the summary of the characteristics of the drug to A@@ bili@@ fy tablets , A@@ bili@@ fy Mel@@ ting tablets or A@@ bili@@ fy solution to intake .
there are no studies on the efficacy of ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol injection @-@ solution in patients with ag@@ ility and behavi@@ our@@ al distur@@ ban@@ ces caused differently than by schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia and man@@ ic epis@@ odes of bi@@ polar I disorder .
if par@@ enter@@ al therapy with ben@@ zo@@ di@@ az@@ ep@@ ines is considered necessary in addition to ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol injection , patients should be observed with regard to extreme se@@ dation or blood pressure loss ( see Section 4.5 ) .
studies on the safety and efficacy of ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol injection solution are not available to patients with alcohol or drug poison@@ ing ( prescribed or illegal drugs ) .
Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol should be used with care in patients with well @-@ known cardiovascular diseases ( m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction or isch@@ em@@ ic heart disease , con@@ ges@@ tive heart failure , hyper@@ tension ) , cereb@@ rov@@ ascular disease , hypo@@ vol@@ emia , treatment with blood pressure lowering drugs ) or hyper@@ tension ( including acute and mal@@ ign@@ ant form ) .
late dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia : in clinical studies lasting one year or less , there were occasional reports of dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia occurring during the treatment with ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol .
clinical manifest@@ ations of a M@@ NS are high fever , stiff@@ ness , changing consciousness levels and signs of autonomous inst@@ ability ( irregular pulse or blood pressure , t@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ dia , swe@@ ating and cardiac ar@@ rhyth@@ mia ) .
poly@@ ph@@ onic , poly@@ ph@@ onic , poly@@ ph@@ ag@@ ia and weakness ) are observed and patients with diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus or with risk factors for diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus should regularly be monitored with regard to a deteri@@ oration of glucose levels .
a weight gain is generally observed in schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ic patients and patients with bi@@ polar man@@ ia because of com@@ or@@ bi@@ di@@ ties , the use of anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics , in which weight gain is known as a side effect or an un@@ healthy lifestyle and could lead to serious complications .
nevertheless , the intensity of the se@@ d@@ ation was greater compared to that after all@@ ot@@ ted of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol , in a study where healthy volunteers received Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol ( 15 mg dose ) as one @-@ off intra@@ mus@@ cul@@ arly and which at the same time received Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am ( 2 mg dose ) intra@@ muscular .
105 The H2 @-@ antagon@@ ist fam@@ ot@@ id@@ ine , a gast@@ ric acid blo@@ cker , reduces the res@@ or@@ ption rate of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol , but this effect is not considered clin@@ ically relevant .
in CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 &apos; bad &apos; ( &apos; poor &apos; ) metabolism agents , the common application with highly effective inhibit@@ ors of CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 can result in higher plasma concentrations of ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole compared to CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 exten@@ sion@@ ers .
other highly effective inhibit@@ ors of CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , like I@@ tra@@ con@@ az@@ ole and HI@@ V@@ - prot@@ e@@ as@@ ein@@ hi@@ bit@@ ors , may have similar effects and therefore similar can reductions should be made .
after setting up the CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6@@ - or 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ or , the dose of A@@ bili@@ fy should be raised to the dose height before the start of the accompanying therapy .

the following side effects were more common in clinical trials with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol injection solution more frequently ( ≥ 1 / 100 ) than plac@@ ebo or were classified as potential medi@@ cally relevant side effects ( * ) ( see Section 5.1 ) :
the frequency of the side effects listed below is defined according to the following criteria : common ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) ; occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1.000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) .
107 The following side effects were more common ( ≥ 1 / 100 ) than plac@@ ebo or were classified as potential medi@@ cally relevant side effects ( * ) in clinical studies ( see section 5.1 ) :
in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled long @-@ term study for 26 weeks , the incidence of EPS was 19 % in patients under ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zol@@ - treatment and 13.@@ 1 % in patients under plac@@ ebo .
in another study of 12 weeks , the incidence of EPS 26.@@ 6 % in patients under ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zol@@ - treatment and 17.@@ 6 % for those under lithium treatment .
in the long @-@ term maintenance phase for 26 weeks in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled trial , the incidence of EPS 18.@@ 2 % for patients under ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole was 15.@@ 7 % for patients treated with plac@@ ebo .
a comparison between the patient groups under ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole and plac@@ ebo , in which potential clin@@ ically significant changes of routine laboratory parameters were detected , did not show any medi@@ cally significant differences .
increases in CP@@ K ( ker@@ at@@ in@@ ph@@ osp@@ ho@@ kin@@ ase ) , generally temporary and asy@@ mpt@@ om@@ atic , were observed in 3.5 % of patients treated with ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol , compared to 2.0 % of patients treated with plac@@ ebo .
the side effects associated with an anti@@ psych@@ otic therapy and their occurrence in the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol include mal@@ ign@@ ant neuro@@ le@@ p@@ tic syndrome , late dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia and var@@ ic@@ ose sei@@ zur@@ es , unwanted cereb@@ rov@@ ascular events and increased mort@@ ality in older dementia patients , hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia and diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus ( see section 4.4 ) .
110 and behavi@@ our@@ al disorders was the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol injection solution with statisti@@ cally significant greater improvements of ag@@ ility / behavi@@ our@@ al related compared to plac@@ ebo and was similar to Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol .
in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled short @-@ term study ( 24 h ) with 291 patients with bi@@ polar disorder as well as ag@@ ility and behavi@@ our@@ al disorders , the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol injection solution was associated with a statisti@@ cally significant improvement in the symptoms regarding ag@@ ility and behavi@@ our@@ al disorders compared to plac@@ ebo and similar to the Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am@@ - reference arm .
the medi@@ an improvement of the bas@@ eline measured at the PAN@@ SS Ex@@ cit@@ ement Compon@@ ent score was 5.@@ 8 for plac@@ ebo , 9.@@ 6 for Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am and 8.@@ 7 for Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole .
in analyses of sub @-@ groups in patients with mixed epis@@ odes or patients with severe ag@@ ility , a similar effectiveness has been observed with regard to the overall population , but a statistical significance could be determined by a reduced number of patients .
in three plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled short @-@ term studies ( 4 to 6 weeks ) at 1,@@ 228 schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ic patients with positive or negative symptoms , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole ( oral ) showed a statisti@@ cally significant improvement in psych@@ otic symptoms compared to plac@@ ebo .
in a hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol @-@ controlled trial , 52 % of respon@@ der patients attending the study medication were similar in both groups ( Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol 77 % ( oral ) and hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol 73 % ) in week 52 .
current values from measuring scales defined as secondary study objectives including PAN@@ SS and Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery @-@ As@@ berg Dep@@ res@@ sions Rates showed a significantly stronger improvement than at Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol .
in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled study for more than 26 weeks in stabili@@ zed patients with chronic schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia , a significantly higher rate of recall rate was seen in Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole ( oral ) , which was 34 % in the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zol@@ - ( oral ) group and 57 % in plac@@ ebo .
in a pseu@@ do @-@ controlled , multinational double @-@ blind study in schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia over 26 weeks , which included 3@@ 14 patients and in which the primary study goal was &apos; weight gain &apos; , significantly fewer patients showed a weight gain of at least 7 % compared to the initial value ( i.e. an increase of at least 5.6 kg with an average weight of ca .
111 In a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled study for 6 weeks with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of a bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , with or without psych@@ otic features , which partly did not apply to lithium or val@@ pro@@ at mon@@ otherapy in therapeutic ser@@ um mirrors , the companion therapy with ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole revealed an superior effectiveness in reducing man@@ ic symptoms compared to mon@@ otherapy involving lithium or val@@ pro@@ at .
in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled study for 26 weeks followed by a 74 week study extension for man@@ ic patients who had achieved a re@@ mission with ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole during a stabil@@ isation period prior to random@@ isation , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole was superior to plac@@ ebo in regard to the prevention of a bi@@ polar return , predominantly in the prevention of a revers@@ al in the man@@ ia .
in the first 2 hours following intra@@ muscular injection , the ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole AU@@ C was 90 % larger than the AU@@ C after dosing of the same dose as a tablet ; system@@ ic exposure was similar between the two form@@ ulations .
in 2 studies involving healthy volunteers , the average time until reaching the maximum plasma level was 1 to 3 hours after application .
the gift of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol injection solution was well toler@@ ated by rats and monkeys and resulted in no direct toxic@@ ity of a target organ after repeated application during system@@ ic exposure ( AU@@ C ) , which was 15 or 5 times higher than the maximum human therapeu@@ tical exposure of 30 mg intra@@ mus@@ cul@@ arly .
in studies on reproductive toxic@@ ity after intra@@ ven@@ ous application , no safety @-@ related concerns after mat@@ ernal exposure , which was 15 - ( rats ) and 29 times ( ra@@ bb@@ its ) over the maximum human@@ therapeutic exposure of 30 mg .
based on conventional studies with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol ( oral ) for safety har@@ mac@@ ology , toxic@@ ity with repeated application , reproduction toxic@@ ity , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity , and the kan@@ dic@@ ated potential , the pre@@ clinical data could not identify any particular dangers to humans .
toxic@@ ologically significant effects were only observed in dos@@ ages or ex@@ positions that significantly exceeded the maximum dose or exposure to humans ; therefore , they have limited or no importance for clinical application .
the effects included a dose @-@ dependent side ni@@ pple tox@@ ici@@ ousness ( li@@ po@@ f@@ us@@ cin @-@ pig@@ ment @-@ accumulation and / or par@@ ench@@ y@@ mal cell loss ) in rats after 104 weeks at the recommended maximum dosage at 60 mg / kg / day ( the 10 times the mean steady @-@ state exposure ( AU@@ C ) at the recommended maximum dose in humans ) .
in addition , a chol@@ eli@@ thi@@ asis was determined as a result of the precip@@ itation of sulph@@ ate con@@ jug@@ ates of the hydro@@ xy@@ - Met@@ abol@@ ites of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol in the G@@ alle from 25 to 125 mg / kg / day ( 1 to 3 times the recommended clinical dose or the 16@@ - to 81 times the recommended maximum dose in humans based on mg / m2 ) .
in ra@@ bb@@ its , these effects were observed after dos@@ ages leading to ex@@ positions of the 3- and 11 @-@ times the middle steady @-@ state AU@@ C at the recommended clinical maximum dose .

the efficacy of Abra@@ x@@ ane was investigated in a major study involving 460 women with metastatic breast cancer , of which around three quarters had previously received an anth@@ ra@@ cycl@@ ine .
the effect of Abra@@ x@@ ane ( in sole gift or as a mon@@ otherapy ) was compared with the drug containing a conventional pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el ( given in combination with other medicines to reduce the side effects ) .
overall , in the main study 72 ( 31 % ) 229 patients treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane were treated to treatment , compared to 37 ( 16 % ) of the 225 patients receiving conventional pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el compounds .
if only the patients who were first treated for metastatic breast cancer , there was no difference between the drugs in terms of efficacy indicators such as time to deteri@@ or@@ ating disease and survival .
in contrast , patients who had previously received other metastatic breast cancer treatments showed that Abra@@ x@@ ane was more effective than conventional pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el .
it may also not be used in patients who have low neut@@ ro@@ ph@@ ils in the blood prior to treatment .
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) found that Abra@@ x@@ ane was more effective in patients in which the first treatment was not more effective than conventional pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el contained drugs and that it does not have to be given with other medicines in contrast to other pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el drugs to reduce side effects .
in January 2008 , the European Commission granted the company Abra@@ xis Bio@@ Science Limited an approval for the placing of Abra@@ x@@ ane in the entire European Union .
Abra@@ x@@ ane mon@@ otherapy is indicated for the treatment of metastatic breast cancer in patients with first @-@ line metastatic disease and for which a standard anth@@ ra@@ cycl@@ ine contained therapy is not indicated ( see also section 4.4 ) .
in patients with severe neut@@ ro@@ pen@@ ia ( neut@@ ro@@ ph@@ ils &lt; 0,@@ 50 x 109 / l over a period of one week or longer ) or serious sensory neu@@ rop@@ athy during the Abra@@ x@@ ane therapy , the dose should be reduced to 220 mg / m2 in subsequent series .
in sens@@ orial neu@@ rop@@ athy Grade 3 the treatment is to inter@@ rupt until an improvement is reached at grade 1 or 2 , and in all subsequent cycles the dose must be reduced .
there are currently no sufficient data for the recommendation of dose adjustments in patients with slight to moderate impair@@ ment of liver function ( see Section 4.@@ 4. and 5.2 ) .
no studies with patients with imp@@ aired ren@@ al function were carried out and there are currently no adequate data on the recommendation of dose adjustments in patients with impair@@ ment of kidney function ( see Section 5.2 ) .
Abra@@ x@@ ane is not recommended for use in children under 18 years of age due to insufficient data on safety and efficacy .
Abra@@ x@@ ane is a alb@@ um@@ in @-@ linked nan@@ op@@ article formulation of pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el , which could have considerably more pharmac@@ ological characteristics than other form@@ ulations of pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el ( see Section 5.1 and 5.2 ) .
if an allergic reaction occurs , the medicine should be removed immediately and a sympt@@ om@@ atic treatment should be initiated and the patient must not be treated with pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el again .
in patients , no renewed abrasion cycles should be initiated until neut@@ ro@@ ph@@ ils increased to &gt; 1.5 x 109 / l and the thro@@ m@@ bo@@ cy@@ te value is increased to &gt; 100 x 109 / l .
patients with severe liver dysfunction ( bili@@ ru@@ bin &gt; 5 x UL@@ N or AS@@ L / AL@@ T &gt; 10 x UL@@ N ) should not be treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane .
while a unique cardi@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity related to abrasion was un@@ proven , cardiac occur@@ ren@@ ces in the indicated patient population are not unusual , especially in patients with early anth@@ ra@@ cycl@@ ine treatment or underlying heart or lung disease .
if nausea , vom@@ iting and diarr@@ ho@@ ea occur in patients after the treatment of Abra@@ x@@ ane , they can be treated with the usual anti@@ em@@ etic and con@@ sti@@ p@@ ating methods .
Abra@@ x@@ ane should not be used in pregnant women or women in child@@ bearing age that do not have effective contra@@ c@@ eption , unless the treatment of the mother with pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el is inevitable .
women of child@@ bearing age should use a reliable contra@@ cep@@ tive method during and up to 1 month after treatment with Abra@@ x@@ ane .
male patients treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane are advised to not produce a child during and up to six months after treatment .
male patients should be advised of a sperm conservation before treatment , because the therapy with Abra@@ x@@ ane is the possibility of ir@@ reversible in@@ fertility .
Abra@@ x@@ ane can cause side effects such as fatigue ( very common ) and di@@ zz@@ iness ( frequent ) which can affect the traffic ti@@ ghtness and the ability to operate machinery .
the following are the most common and major incidents of side effects that occurred in 229 patients with metastatic breast cancer who were treated with 260 mg / m2 of abra@@ x@@ ane every three weeks at the pi@@ vot@@ alen clinical phase III trial .
neut@@ ro@@ pen@@ ia was the most con@@ spic@@ uous hem@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity ( reported in 79 % of patients ) and was rapidly reversible and dose @-@ dependent ; leu@@ kop@@ enia was reported in 71 % of patients .
an@@ emia ( H@@ b &lt; 10 g / dl ) was observed in 46 % of patients treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane and was severe in three cases ( H@@ b &lt; 8 g / dl ) .
table 1 shows the side effects associated with the administration of Abra@@ x@@ ane as mon@@ otherapy at each dose and indication in studies ( N = 7@@ 89 ) .
very common ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) ; occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) ; rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 , &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) ; very rare ( &lt; 1 / 10.000 ) .
occasionally : increased blood pressure , weight gain , increased lac@@ tic de@@ hydro@@ gen@@ ase in the blood , increased blood sugar , increased phosph@@ or@@ us in the blood , reduced potassium in the blood of heart disease :
dy@@ sph@@ ag@@ ia , blo@@ ating , tongue burning , dry mouth , pain of teeth , loose sto@@ ols , o@@ es@@ oph@@ ag@@ itis , pain in the abdominal , ul@@ c@@ ers in the mouth , oral pain , rec@@ tal bleeding disorders of the kid@@ neys and ur@@ inary tract :
pain in chest wall , weakness of muscles , neck pain , abdominal pain , muscle sp@@ as@@ ms , pain in skel@@ etal mus@@ cul@@ ature , bac@@ kl@@ ash , dis@@ comfort in limbs , muscle weakness Very frequent :
rest@@ lessness 1 The frequency of hyper@@ sensitivity reactions is calculated based on a definitive in the related case in a population of 7@@ 89 patients
since these events were reported on a voluntary basis during clinical practice , no estimates of the actual frequency are possible and no caus@@ al connection with these events has been established .
pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el is an anti @-@ mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ ules drug that promotes the inter@@ reloc@@ ation of the mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ ules from the tu@@ b@@ ular Indi@@ ans and stabili@@ zes the mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ ules by blocking their land@@ oly@@ meri@@ zation .
this stabili@@ zation leads to an in@@ hibition of the normal dynamic re@@ organisation of the mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ ular network , which is essential for the vital inter@@ phase and the mit@@ otic cell functions .
it is known that alb@@ um@@ in medi@@ ates the trans@@ cy@@ to@@ sis of plasma components into the end@@ othel@@ ial cells and in the context of in @-@ vitro studies it has been demonstrated that the presence of alb@@ um@@ in promotes the transport of pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el through end@@ othel@@ ial cells .
it is assumed that this improved tran@@ sen@@ dop@@ i@@ ale transport is medi@@ ated by the g@@ p @-@ 60 alb@@ umin@@ re@@ ep@@ tor and due to the alb@@ umin@@ ating protein SP@@ ARC ( ec@@ lip@@ ted protein aci@@ dic rich in c@@ yst@@ eine ) a pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el accumulation occurs in the tumor area .
the application of Abra@@ x@@ ane for metastatic breast cancer is supported by 106 patients in two single @-@ arm un@@ linked studies and of 4@@ 54 patients treated in a random@@ ised Phase III trial study .
in one study , 43 patients with metastatic breast cancer were treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane , which was given in the form of an in@@ fusion for 30 minutes with a dose of 175 mg / m2 .
in the second study , a dose of 300 mg / m2 was used as an in@@ fusion of over 30 minutes to 63 patients with metastatic breast cancer .
this multic@@ enter study was performed in patients with metastatic breast cancer , which received a mon@@ otherapy with pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el every 3 weeks , either in the form of solvent containing pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el 175 mg / m2 , or in the form of abrasion of 260 mg / m2 as a 30 @-@ minute in@@ fusion without pre@@ medication ( N = 229 ) .
in the study , 64 % of patients had a imp@@ aired general condition ( ECO@@ G 1 or 2 ) , 79 % had vis@@ cer@@ al metast@@ ases and 76 % had more than 3 metast@@ ases .
14 % of patients had previously received no chemotherapy ; 27 % had only one adj@@ uv@@ ant chemotherapy , 40 % only for metastatic disease and 19 % because of metastatic disease and adj@@ uv@@ ant treatment .
9 The results for the general response rate and time to progression @-@ free survival and progression @-@ free survival and survival for patients who receive first @-@ line therapy are shown below .
neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity compared to pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el was evaluated by the improvement of a degree for patients who experienced a peripheral neu@@ rop@@ athy Grade 3 at a time during therapy .
the natural course of peripheral neu@@ rop@@ athy towards bas@@ eline due to the cum@@ ulative toxic@@ ity of Abra@@ x@@ ane after &gt; 6 treatment courses has not been evaluated and remains unknown .
the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of the total pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el after 30@@ - and 180 @-@ minute treatments of Abra@@ x@@ ane with a dose of 80 to 375 mg / m2 was determined in clinical studies .
the active substance exposure ( AU@@ C ) increased lin@@ early from 26@@ 53 to 16@@ 7@@ 36 n@@ g@@ .@@ h / ml , analog@@ ous to a dose of 80 to 300 mg / m2 .
10 Fol@@ lowing an intra@@ ven@@ ous dose of Abra@@ x@@ ane in patients with metastatic breast cancer in the recommended clinical dose of 260 mg / m2 , the pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el plasma concentration decreased in a multi@@ phase manner .
the medium distribution volume amounted to 6@@ 32 l / m2 ; the high distribution volume points to an extensive extra@@ vas@@ cul@@ ari@@ ous distribution and / or soft tissue linking of pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el .
in a study involving advanced solid tum@@ ours the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic properties of pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el were compared with intra@@ ven@@ ous 30 @-@ minute in@@ fusion of 260 mg / m2 of abra@@ x@@ ane compared with a 3 @-@ hour injection of 175 mg / m2 of solvent containing pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el .
the clearance of pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el was higher ( 43 % ) than after a solvent containing pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el injection , and the distribution volume was higher at Abra@@ x@@ ane ( 53 % ) .
in published literature about in @-@ vitro studies of human liver micro@@ some and tissue hist@@ ories , it is reported that pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el is met@@ aboli@@ zed primarily to 6@@ α -@@ hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el and to two smaller metabol@@ ites ( 3 &quot; -@@ p @-@ hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el and 6@@ α @-@ -3 &quot; -@@ p @-@ di@@ hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el ) .
after a 30 @-@ minute in@@ fusion of 260 mg / m2 of abra@@ x@@ ane in patients with metastatic breast cancer , the mean value for cum@@ ulative ur@@ inary ex@@ cre@@ tion of the unchanged total dose with less than 1 % of the metabol@@ ites 6@@ α -@@ hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el and 3 &quot; -@@ p @-@ hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el , leading to a far @-@ reaching non @-@ ren@@ al clear@@ ance .
however , only a few data is available for patients at the age of 75 , since only 3 patients of this age group participated in the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic analysis .
chemical and physical stability was detected at 2 ° C - 8 ° C in original box and in light light over 8 hours .
pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el is a cy@@ tot@@ ox@@ ic an@@ tic@@ ar@@ cin@@ ogenic drug and , as well as other potentially toxic substances , should be treated with abrasion .
using a sterile sy@@ ringe , over a period of at least 1 minute 20 ml of a 9 mg / ml ( 0.9 % ) sodium chlori@@ de in@@ fusion solution is inj@@ ected into a abrasion bottle .
after complete enc@@ ore the solution should rest for at least 5 minutes to ensure a good wet@@ ting of the solid .
then the screw bottle should be swi@@ vel@@ ed and / or inver@@ ted for at least 2 minutes and / or inver@@ ted until a complete res@@ us@@ el@@ board of the powder is eff@@ ected .
if f@@ akes or sin@@ ks are visible , the pier@@ cing bottle must be inver@@ ted gently to achieve a complete res@@ us@@ el@@ board before application .

member states must ensure that the holder of authorization for placing on the market before the market launch will provide medical professionals in di@@ aly@@ sis centres and retail pharmac@@ ies with the following information and materials :
• Training brochure • Sum@@ mary of the characteristics of the medicine ( specialist information ) , labelling and package inserts . • With unique visual representation of the correct application of the product provided cooling boxes for transport through the patients .
this means that Ab@@ se@@ amed is similar to a biological medicine approved in the European Union ( EU ) and contains the same ingredient ( also called &quot; reference medicinal products &quot; ) .
it is used in patients with normal blood @-@ iron values , in which complications may arise in connection with blood trans@@ fusion , if blood circulation is not possible before the procedure and a blood loss of 900 to 1 800 ml is to be expected .
the treatment with Ab@@ se@@ amed must be initiated under the supervision of a doctor who has experience in the treatment of patients with diseases for which the medicine is indicated .
in patients with kidney problems and in patients who want to make a blood donation , Ab@@ se@@ amed is inj@@ ected into a v@@ ein .
the injec@@ tions can also be made by the patient or his super@@ visor , provided they have received an appropriate instruction .
in patients with chronic ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency or in patients receiving chemotherapy , the ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in values should always be in the recommended range ( between 10 and 12 grams per dec@@ il@@ iter in adults and between 9.5 and 11 g / dl in children ) .
the iron values of all patients must be checked before treatment to ensure that no iron deficiency exists , and iron supplements should be administered throughout the treatment .
in patients receiving chemotherapy , or in patients with kidney problems , an@@ a@@ emia may be caused by an er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ i@@ et@@ ine deficiency , or that the body does not respond adequately to the body &apos;s er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ ie@@ tin .
er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ ie@@ tin is also used before surgery to increase the number of red blood cells and thus reduce the consequences of blood loss .
it is produced by a cell in which a gene ( DNA ) was introduced , which it enables the formation of epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa .
when administered as an injection , Ab@@ se@@ amed was compared to a major study involving 4@@ 79 patients suffering from an@@ emia caused by kidney problems and compared with the reference medicinal product .
all patients participating in this study were inj@@ ected E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o in a v@@ ein for at least eight weeks before either ren@@ amed or continued to receive E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o .
the main indicator for efficacy was the change in hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in values between the beginning of the study and the assessment period in the weeks 25 to 29 .
the company also presented the results of a study in which the effects of fl@@ amed Ab@@ se@@ amed with those of E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o were studied in 114 cancer patients receiving chemotherapy .
in the study with patients suffering from an@@ emia caused by kidney problems , the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in values of patients who were converted to Ab@@ se@@ amed were kept in the same measure as those received by E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o .
in comparison , patients who continue to receive E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o showed an increase of 0.0@@ 63 g / dl of the initial value of 12.@@ 0 g / dl .
the most common side effect of Ab@@ se@@ amed is an increase in blood pressure , which may occasionally lead to symptoms of enc@@ ephal@@ opath@@ y ( brain problems ) such as sudden , pier@@ cing mig@@ raine head@@ aches and confusion .
Ab@@ se@@ amed may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa or any of the other ingredients .
Ab@@ se@@ amed as an injection under the skin is not recommended for treating kidney problems as further studies are required to ensure that this does not trigger allergic reactions .
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that a comparable quality , safety and efficacy profile such as E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o has been shown for Ab@@ se@@ amed according to the European Union regulations .
the company that produces Ab@@ se@@ amed will provide information packages for the medical professionals in all Member States , including information on the safety of the medicine .
in August 2007 , the European Commission granted approval to the company Medi@@ ce Medic@@ ines P@@ üt@@ ter GmbH &amp; Co . kg for the placing of Ab@@ se@@ amed across the European Union .
treatment of an@@ a@@ emia and reduction of trans@@ fusion needs in adults with solid tum@@ ours , mal@@ ign@@ ant lymph@@ oma or multi@@ ple@@ m my@@ el@@ oma who receive chemotherapy and in which there is a risk of trans@@ fusion due to the general condition ( for example cardiovascular status , pre@@ existing an@@ emia at the beginning of chemotherapy ) .
the treatment should be performed only in patients with moderate an@@ emia ( ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in &#91; H@@ b &#93; 10 - 13 g / dl &#91; 6.@@ 2 - 8.1 m@@ mo@@ l / l &#93; , if blood @-@ saving measures are not available or inadequate , in case of planned larger surgical procedures , which require a large volume of blood ( 4 or more blood in women ; 5 or more units of blood in men ) .
to reduce foreign blood , Ab@@ se@@ amed can be used in front of a large elec@@ tive orthop@@ a@@ edi@@ c intervention in adults without iron deficiency , in which high risk of trans@@ fusion complications is to be expected .
HB 10 @-@ 13 g / dl ) and an expected blood loss of 900 @-@ 1800 ml , which can not take part in an aut@@ olog@@ ous blood donation program .
the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in target concentration is between 10 and 12 g / dl ( 6.@@ 2 - 7.5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) , except for pedi@@ at@@ ric patients , where the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in concentration should lie between 9,5 and 11 g / dl ( 5.@@ 9 - 6,@@ 8 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
symptoms of an@@ emia and symptoms may vary depending on age , sex and total disease ; therefore , the evaluation of the individual clinical course and conditions of illness by the physician is necessary .
a rise in hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in by more than 2 g / dl ( 1.25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) over a period of four weeks should be avoided .
due to the vari@@ ability between patients , individual hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in values can occasionally be observed in a patient or under the ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in target concentration .
in light of this ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in vari@@ ability , a corresponding dose management should be tried to reach the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in target concentration of 10 g / dl ( 6.@@ 2@@ m@@ mo@@ l / l ) up to 12 g / dl ( 7.5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
if the ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in value increases by more than 2 g / dl ( 1.25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month or if the persistent ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in exceeds 12 g / dl ( 7.5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) , the ep@@ ic @-@ al@@ fa dose is reduced by 25 % .
patients should be closely monitored to ensure that epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is used in the lowest approved dose which is required for the control of an@@ a@@ emia and an@@ emia symptoms .
the clinical results suggest that patients with very low H@@ b value ( &lt; 6 g / dl or &lt; 3.@@ 75 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) may need higher conservation doses than patients in which initial an@@ a@@ emia is less pronounced ( H@@ b &gt; 8 g / dl or &gt; 5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
the clinical results suggest that patients with very low H@@ b value ( &lt; 6.8 g / dl or &lt; 4.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) may need higher conservation doses than patients in which initial an@@ a@@ emia is less pronounced ( H@@ b &gt; 6.8 g / dl or &gt; 4,@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
starting dose 50 I.@@ U. / kg three times a week by intra@@ ven@@ ous application , if necessary with an increase in dose of 25 I.@@ U. / kg ( three times a week ) until the desired target value is reached ( this should be done in steps of at least 4 weeks ) .
symptoms of an@@ emia and sequ@@ el@@ ae may vary depending on age , sex and total disease ; therefore , the evaluation of the individual clinical course and conditions of illness by the physician is necessary .
in light of this ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in vari@@ ability , a corresponding dose management should be tried to reach the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in target concentration of 10 g / dl ( 6.@@ 2@@ m@@ mo@@ l / l ) up to 12 g / dl ( 7.5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
patients should be closely monitored to ensure that epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is used in the lowest approved dose which is required to control the an@@ emia symptoms .
if the ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in value is increased by at least 1 g / dl ( 0.@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) or the number of re@@ tic@@ u@@ lo@@ sis by ≥ 40.000 cells / µl compared to the initial value , the dose should be maintained three times a week or 450 I.@@ U. / kg once a week .
if the ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in rise &lt; 1 g / dl ( &lt; 0,@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and the Re@@ tic@@ u@@ lo@@ cy@@ te value has increased to &lt; 40.000 cells / µl , the dose should be increased to 300 I.@@ U. / kg three times a week .
in case of further 4 weeks of treatment with 300 I.@@ U. / kg three times a week of ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in value ≥ 1 g / dl ( ≥ 0.@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) or the bacterial counts of ≥ 40.000 cells / µl should be maintained three times a week .
in contrast , the ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in value of &lt; 1 g / dl ( &lt; 0,@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) or the number of Re@@ tic@@ u@@ lo@@ zy@@ tes increased by &lt; 40.000 cells / µl compared to the initial value , is an indication of the ep@@ ic @-@ al@@ fa treatment unlikely and the treatment should be canc@@ eled .
patients with mild an@@ a@@ emia ( ha@@ em@@ ato@@ cri@@ t 33 - 39 % ) , in which the precau@@ tionary storage of ≥ 4 blood con@@ tours is required , should be obtained in a dose of 600 I.@@ U. / kg body weight twice a week for 3 weeks prior to surgery .
iron sub@@ stitution should begin as early as possible , for example a few weeks before the start of aut@@ olog@@ ous blood don@@ or programme , so that large iron reserves are available prior to the beginning of the Ab@@ se@@ amed therapy .
6 The recommended dosage is 600 I.@@ U. / kg ep@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa , which should be given once a week for three weeks ( day 21 , 14 and 7 ) before surgery and on the day of surgery ( day 0 ) .
in this case epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa should pre@@ oper@@ atively present 300 I.@@ U. / kg to 10 consecutive days each , on the day of the procedure as well as 4 days immediately afterwards .
alternatively , the injection at the end of di@@ aly@@ sis can be given via a fi@@ st@@ ula needle , followed by 10 ml is@@ ot@@ onic sal@@ ine solution to flush the hose and ensure adequate injection of the medicine into the circulation .
patients suffering from an er@@ y@@ thro@@ bla@@ sto@@ sis in an er@@ y@@ thro@@ bla@@ sto@@ en@@ ie ( pure Red Cell A@@ pl@@ asia , PR@@ CA ) should not receive a Ab@@ se@@ amed or another er@@ y@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin ( see section 4.4 - er@@ y@@ thro@@ bla@@ sto@@ en@@ ie ) .
heart attack or stroke within a month prior to treatment , un@@ stable ang@@ ina pec@@ tor@@ is , increased risk of deep ven@@ ous thro@@ mb@@ oses ( e.g. an@@ am@@ n@@ estic known ven@@ ous thro@@ mb@@ bo@@ em@@ bol@@ ism ) .
in patients who are en@@ vis@@ aged for greater elec@@ tive orthop@@ a@@ edi@@ c surgery and which cannot participate in an aut@@ olog@@ ous blood donation program , the application of epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is contra@@ indicated in the following pre@@ - , accompanying or underlying disease : severe cor@@ on@@ ary heart disease , peripheral arter@@ ial disease , v@@ ascular disease of the car@@ cin@@ oma or cereb@@ rov@@ ascular disorder ; in patients with recently occurred heart attack or cereb@@ rov@@ ascular event .
er@@ y@@ thro@@ bla@@ sto@@ en@@ y ( PR@@ CA ) Very rare was reported on the occurrence of an antibody @-@ medi@@ ated PR@@ CA after months of treatment with sub@@ cut@@ aneous er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ ie@@ tin .
in patients with sudden loss of action , defined as a reduction in hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in values ( 1 - 2 g / dl per month ) with increased need for trans@@ f@@ usions , the re@@ tic@@ u@@ lo@@ cy@@ te value should be determined and the usual causes for non @-@ response ( iron , fo@@ lic acid or vitamin B@@ 12 deficiency , aluminum tox@@ id@@ ation , infections or inflamm@@ ations , blood loss and ha@@ em@@ oly@@ sis ) are examined .
if the Re@@ tik@@ u@@ lo@@ zy@@ te value , taking into account the an@@ a@@ emia ( i.e. the re@@ tic@@ u@@ loc@@ us &quot; index &quot; ) , is low ( &lt; 20.000 / mm@@ 3 or &lt; 0.5 % ) , the thro@@ m@@ bo@@ cy@@ ten@@ - and leu@@ ko@@ cy@@ te numbers are determined , and if no other cause of an effective loss is found , the anti @-@ er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ ie@@ tin antibodies should be induced to diagnose a PR@@ CA .
the data on immun@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity in sub@@ cut@@ aneous use of Ab@@ se@@ amed in patients with a risk of antibody @-@ induced PR@@ CA ( patients with ren@@ al an@@ emia ) are not sufficient .
8 In patients with chronic ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency , the recommended upper limit of hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in concentration should not be exceeded under section 4.2 .
in clinical trials , increased mort@@ ality risk and risk for serious cardiovascular events were observed when er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ esis @-@ stimulating active substances ( ESA ) were given with a ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in concentration of over 12 g / dl ( 7.5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
controlled clinical studies have shown no significant benefit if the ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in concentration is increased by the concentration required to control the an@@ emia symptoms and the avoi@@ dance of blood trans@@ f@@ usions .
the ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in rose should be approximately 1 g / dl ( 0.@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month and should not exceed 2 g / dl ( 1.25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month to minimize the risk of increasing high blood pressure .
in patients with chronic ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency and clin@@ ically evident cor@@ on@@ ary heart disease or con@@ ges@@ tive heart failure , the recommended upper limit of hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in concentration should not be exceeded in maintenance therapy .
according to the present findings , the treatment of an@@ a@@ emia with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa in adults with ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency , which are not yet to be di@@ aly@@ sis , does not accelerate the progression of ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency .
for tumour patients with chemotherapy , a 2 @-@ 3 @-@ week delay between epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa @-@ administration and er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ ie@@ tin response should be considered for ass@@ essing the therapy efficiency of epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa ( patients who have to be trans@@ coded ) .
if the H@@ b increase exceeds 2 g / dl ( 1.25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month or a H@@ b @-@ value of 13 g / dl ( 8.1 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) , the dose must be adjusted according to section 4.2 to minimize the risk of possible thro@@ m@@ bot@@ ic events ( see section 4.2 treatment of patients with chem@@ otherapeu@@ tic an@@ a@@ emia - dosage adjustment with the goal of holding the ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in value between 10 g / dl and 12 g / dl ) .
the decision for the use of re@@ combin@@ ant er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ et@@ ine should be based on a benefit @-@ risk assessment based on the participation of the patient , which should also take into account the specific clinical context .
in patients who are en@@ vis@@ aged for greater elec@@ tive orthop@@ a@@ edi@@ c surgery , the cause of an@@ a@@ emia should be examined and treated if possible prior to epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa therapy .
patients who undergo major elec@@ tive orthop@@ a@@ edi@@ c surgery should have an appropriate thro@@ m@@ bo@@ sis pro@@ phyla@@ xis , as they have an increased risk of thro@@ m@@ bot@@ ic and v@@ ascular diseases , especially with an underlying cardiovascular disease .
in addition , it cannot be ruled out that for treatment with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa for patients with a starting threshold of &gt; 13 g / dl there is an increased risk of post @-@ operative thro@@ m@@ bot@@ ic / v@@ ascular events .
in several controlled trials , epo@@ e@@ tin was not proven to improve overall survival in tumour patients with sympt@@ om@@ atic an@@ a@@ emia or reduce the risk of tumour progression .
4 months in patients with metastatic breast cancer who received chemotherapy , when hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in target concentration was targeted at 12 - 14 g / dl ( 7.5 - 8,7 m@@ mo@@ l / l )
if epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is used together with C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in , the blood level of C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in should be controlled and the C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in dose should be adjusted to the rise in hem@@ ato@@ cri@@ t .
in vitro studies on tumor tissues , there is no evidence of an interaction between epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa and G @-@ CS@@ F or GM @-@ CS@@ F regarding hem@@ at@@ ological differentiation or prolifer@@ ation .
through thro@@ m@@ bot@@ ic , v@@ ascular events such as m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial isch@@ emia , m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction , cereb@@ rov@@ ascular attacks , deep ven@@ ous thro@@ m@@ bo@@ sis , arter@@ ial thro@@ m@@ bo@@ sis , pul@@ mon@@ ary thro@@ mb@@ oses , an@@ eur@@ ys@@ m , retin@@ o@@ thro@@ mb@@ oses , and 11 blood cl@@ ots in artificial kid@@ neys were reported in patients under er@@ y@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin therapy , as well as patients under epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa .
the most common adverse effect during treatment with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is a dose @-@ dependent increase in blood pressure or the deteri@@ oration of an existing hyper@@ tension .
increased incidence of thro@@ m@@ bo@@ v@@ ascular events ( see Section 4.4 and Section 4.8 - General ) was observed in patients with er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ et@@ ins .
regardless of er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ ie@@ tin treatment , thro@@ m@@ bot@@ ic and v@@ ascular complications can occur in surgical patients with cardiovascular disease .
the gene@@ tically won epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is gly@@ co@@ sides and is identical to the amino acids and carbohydr@@ ate content with the endo@@ genous human er@@ y@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin isolated from the urine of an@@ emia .
it could be shown with the help of cultures of human bone mar@@ row cells that epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa specifically stimulates er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ esis and does not affect leu@@ kop@@ o@@ esis .
38@@ 9 patients with hem@@ og@@ bla@@ st@@ oses ( 221 multiple my@@ el@@ omes , 144 non @-@ Ho@@ dg@@ kin &apos;s lymph@@ omas and 24 other ha@@ em@@ o@@ bla@@ sto@@ sis ) and 332 patients with solid tum@@ ours ( 172 breast cancer tum@@ ours , 23 bron@@ chi@@ al car@@ cin@@ omas , 22 prostate cancer , 21 g@@ astro@@ intestinal canc@@ ers , and 30 more ) .
1895 patients with solid tum@@ ours ( 6@@ 83 breast cancer , 260 bron@@ chi@@ al car@@ cin@@ omas , 174 gy@@ na@@ ecological tum@@ ours , 300 g@@ astro@@ intestinal tum@@ ours and 4@@ 78 others ) and 80@@ 2 patients with hem@@ og@@ bla@@ st@@ oses .
survival and progression were studied in five major controlled trials with a total of 28@@ 33 patients ; four of these studies were double @-@ blind plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled studies and
in the open study there was no difference in overall survival between patients treated with re@@ combin@@ ant human er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ ie@@ tin and control patients .
in these studies , patients treated with re@@ combin@@ ant human er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ ie@@ tin with an@@ a@@ emia due to several frequent mal@@ ign@@ omas were consistent , statisti@@ cally significantly higher mort@@ ality than in controls .
overall survival in the studies could not be explained by differences in the incidence of thro@@ m@@ bo@@ sis and related complications in patients treated with re@@ combin@@ ant human er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ ie@@ tin and in controls .
there is an increased risk of thro@@ m@@ bo@@ em@@ bol@@ ism in tumour patients treated with re@@ combin@@ ant human er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ ie@@ tin and a negative effect on overall survival cannot be excluded .
it is not clear how far these results are transferred to the application of re@@ combin@@ ant human er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ ie@@ tin in tumour patients treated with chemotherapy with the aim of reaching a hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in value below 13 g / dl , as too few patients with these characteristics were included in the reviewed data .
epo@@ e@@ tin @-@ al@@ fa @-@ determin@@ ations after repeated intra@@ ven@@ ous application showed a half @-@ life of about 4 hours in healthy volunteers and a somewhat extended half @-@ life of approximately 5 hours in patients with ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency .
after sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection , the ser@@ um levels of epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa are much lower than the ser@@ um levels achieved after intra@@ ven@@ ous injection .
there is no accumulation : the ser@@ um levels remain the same regardless of whether they are determined 24 hours after the first gift or 24 hours after the last gift .
( bone mar@@ row Fi@@ bro@@ sis is a well known complic@@ ation of chronic ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency in humans and could be attributed to secondary hyper@@ par@@ ath@@ y@@ ro@@ i@@ dis@@ m or unknown factors .
in a study of hem@@ odi@@ aly@@ sis patients who were treated with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa for three years , the incidence of bone mar@@ row fibro@@ sis was not increased compared to the control group with di@@ aly@@ sis patients who were not treated with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa ) .

an updated R@@ MP should be provided at the same time with the next updated report on the safety of the medicine ( Peri@@ odi@@ c Safety Update Report , P@@ SUR ) according to the &quot; CH@@ MP Gui@@ del@@ ine on Risk Management Systems for research products for human use . &quot;
in addition , an updated R@@ MP should be submitted : • with the receipt of new information that may have an impact on the current safety specifications ( Safety Speci@@ fication ) , the pharmac@@ o@@ vig@@ il@@ ance plan or the risk reduction measures • within 60 days of reaching an important ( the pharmaceutical vig@@ il@@ ance or risk reduction ) milestone
• If you suffer from a heart attack or stroke within a month before your treatment , if you suffer from un@@ stable ang@@ ina pec@@ tor@@ is ( for the first time occurring or increased chest pain ) , there is a risk of blood dro@@ ple@@ t formation in the v@@ eins ( deep ven@@ ous thro@@ mb@@ oses ) , for example , if such a drop of blood has occ@@ ured .
you suffer from severe circul@@ atory disorders of the heart ( cor@@ on@@ ary heart disease ) , arter@@ ies of the legs or arms ( peripheral arter@@ ial disease ) , the cervi@@ cal vessels ( v@@ ascular disease of the lo@@ cos ) or the brain ( cereb@@ rov@@ ascular disease ) have recently suffered a heart attack or stroke .
during the treatment with Ab@@ se@@ amed , it can lead to a slight dose @-@ dependent increase in the number of blood plat@@ el@@ ets within the normal range , which re@@ forms with further treatment .
your doctor may , if necessary , perform regular blood tests to regularly check the number of plat@@ el@@ ets during the first 8 weeks of treatment .
deficiency of iron , dis@@ solution of red blood cells ( ha@@ em@@ oly@@ sis ) , blood loss , vitamin B@@ 12 or fo@@ lic acid deficiency , should be considered and treated before starting treatment with Ab@@ se@@ amed .
very rarely has been reported on the occurrence of an antibody @-@ medi@@ ated er@@ y@@ thro@@ bla@@ sto@@ op@@ enia following months to years of treatment with sub@@ cut@@ an@@ em ( under the skin of a spra@@ yed ) er@@ y@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin .
if you suffer from er@@ y@@ thro@@ bla@@ sto@@ en@@ y , it will break down your therapy with Ab@@ se@@ amed and determine how your an@@ emia will be treated best .
hence , Ab@@ se@@ amed must be given by injection into a v@@ ein ( intra@@ ven@@ ous ) if you are treated because of an@@ a@@ emia due to kidney disease .
a high ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in value may be the risk of problems with the heart or blood vessels and the risk of death could be increased .
in case of increased or increasing potassium levels , your doctor may consider inter@@ ruption of the treatment with Ab@@ se@@ amed until the potassium values are in the normal range again .
if you suffer from chronic kidney disease and clin@@ ically clear cor@@ on@@ ary heart disease or ges@@ tion signs caused by insufficient heart performance , your doctor will make sure that your hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in mirror does not exceed a particular value .
according to the present findings , the treatment of an@@ a@@ emia with Ab@@ se@@ amed in adults with chronic kidney disease ( ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency ) , which are not yet to be di@@ aly@@ sis , does not accelerate the progression of ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency .
a 2 @-@ 3 @-@ week delay between epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa @-@ administration and the desired effect should be considered for ass@@ essing the effectiveness of Ab@@ se@@ amed .
200 Your doctor will regularly determine your values of the red blood color@@ ant ( ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in ) and adjust your ren@@ amed dose accordingly to minim@@ ise the risk of dro@@ pl@@ ets ( thro@@ m@@ bot@@ ic event ) as low as possible .
this risk should be weigh@@ ed very carefully compared to the benefits derived from treatment with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa , especially if you have an increased risk of thro@@ m@@ bot@@ ic v@@ ascular events , e.g. if you are obes@@ e ( adi@@ p@@ ous ) or if in the past , thro@@ m@@ bot@@ ic v@@ ascular events have occ@@ ured ( e.g. a deep ven@@ ous thro@@ mb@@ oses or pul@@ mon@@ ary em@@ bol@@ ism ) .
if you are cancer patients , bear in mind that Ab@@ se@@ amed is a growth factor for blood cells and , in certain circumstances , can adver@@ sely affect the tumor .
if you have a major orthop@@ edi@@ c surgery , before treatment commen@@ ces with Ab@@ se@@ amed the cause of your an@@ a@@ emia should be examined and treated accordingly .
if your values of the red blood @-@ dy@@ e ( ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in ) are too high , you should not receive Ab@@ se@@ amed because there is an increased risk of blood boun@@ cing after the operation .
please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you are taking or applying other medicines or have been taken / applied recently , even if it is not prescription medicine .
if you are taking C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( means of supp@@ ressing the immune system ) during your therapy with Ab@@ se@@ amed , your doctor may possibly prescri@@ be certain blood tests to measure the blood level of C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in .
laboratory tests have shown no interaction between epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa and G @-@ CS@@ F or GM @-@ CS@@ F ( G @-@ CS@@ F and GM @-@ CS@@ F are means of building up the immune system , for example in cancer chemotherapy or HIV ) .
depending on how your an@@ a@@ emia ( an@@ a@@ emia ) appe@@ als to the treatment , the dose may be adjusted every four weeks until your condition is under control .
your doctor may , if necessary , arrange regular blood tests to check the success of the treatment and make sure the medicine works properly and that your ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in does not exceed a particular value .
as soon as you are well tuned , you will receive regular doses of between 25 and 50 I.@@ U. / kg twice a week , spread over two equally large injec@@ tions .
your doctor may , if necessary , arrange regular blood tests to check the success of your treatment and make sure that your ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in does not exceed a particular value .
depending on how an@@ a@@ emia respon@@ ds to the treatment , the dose can be adjusted every four weeks until the condition is under control .
to make sure that the ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in value does not exceed a particular value , the attending physician will carry out regular blood tests .
if necessary to sh@@ orten the treatment time before surgery , a dose of 300 I.@@ U. / kg can be given to 10 consecutive days before surgery , on the day of the procedure and another 4 days after surgery .
however , if your doctor looks this for appropriate , you can also learn how to sp@@ lash out oneself under the skin .

A@@ cl@@ asta is used to treat the following diseases : o@@ steopor@@ osis ( a disease that makes bones br@@ ittle ) both in women after men@@ op@@ ause and in men .
it is used in patients with a high frac@@ tures risk ( frac@@ tures ) , including those who have recently suffered a trau@@ matic hip break as in the case of a fever ; • Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get of the bone , a disease that changes the normal course of bone growth .
in addition patients with mor@@ bus pa@@ get should take at least 500 mg of calcium two times daily for at least 10 days after the treatment ; patients with hip frac@@ tures should receive a large dose of vitamin D ( 50 000 to 125 000 IE ) or@@ ally or by injec@@ ting into a muscle before the first in@@ fusion .
the administration of par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol or i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen ( mean against inflammation ) shortly after use of A@@ cl@@ asta inhi@@ bits the symptoms associated with in@@ fusion , such as fever , muscle pain , flu @-@ like symptoms , joint pain and head@@ aches .
for the treatment of Pa@@ get &apos;s disease , A@@ cl@@ asta can only be prescribed by doctors who have experience in the treatment of this disease .
since the agent in A@@ cl@@ asta is the same as in Z@@ omet@@ a , part of the data material for Z@@ omet@@ a was used to evaluate A@@ cl@@ asta .
in the first study , nearly 8@@ 0,000 older women were involved in o@@ steopor@@ osis , and the number of spine and hip frac@@ tures was examined over a period of three years .
the second study included 2 127 men and women with o@@ steopor@@ osis over 50 years who recently suffered a hip fra@@ cture ; the number of frac@@ tures was examined over a period of up to five years .
at Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , A@@ cl@@ asta was tested in two studies on a total of 3@@ 57 patients and compared for six months with Ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ at ( another bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate ) .
the main indicator of the efficacy was whether the content of the alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase in the ser@@ um ( an enzyme that breaks down bone substance ) in the blood re@@ norm@@ alized or decreased by at least 75 % compared to the initial value .
in the study involving elderly women , the risk of verteb@@ ra@@ e frac@@ tures in patients under A@@ cl@@ asta ( excluding other o@@ steopor@@ osis ) was reduced by 70 % over a period of three years compared to the plac@@ ebo patients .
compared to all patients under A@@ cl@@ asta ( with or without other o@@ steopor@@ osis ) with those under plac@@ ebo , the risk of hip frac@@ tures was reduced by 41 % .
in the study involving men and women with hip frac@@ tures , 9 % of patients under A@@ cl@@ asta had a fra@@ cture ( 92 from 1 0@@ 65 ) versus 13 % of patients under plac@@ ebo ( 139 of 1 0@@ 62 ) .
most A@@ cl@@ asta adverse events occur within the first three days after in@@ fusion and are less frequent in repeated infections .
A@@ cl@@ asta may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to Zol@@ t@@ ron@@ ics or other bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates or any of the other ingredients .
as with all bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates , patients with A@@ cl@@ asta are exposed to the risk of kidney problems , reactions to the in@@ fusion point and o@@ ste@@ on@@ ec@@ sis ( death of bone tissue ) in the jaw .
the manufacturer of A@@ cl@@ asta provides information for doctors who prescri@@ be A@@ cl@@ asta to treat o@@ steopor@@ osis , containing tips on how to use the medicine , as well as similar material for patients in which the side effects of the medicine are explained and pointed out when they should contact the doctor .
in April 2005 , the European Commission granted the company Nov@@ arti@@ s Euro@@ ph@@ arm Limited an approval for the transport of A@@ cl@@ asta throughout the European Union .

intra@@ ven@@ ous in@@ fusion of 5 mg A@@ cl@@ asta is recommended once a year to treat post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al o@@ steopor@@ osis and o@@ steopor@@ osis in men .
in patients with low @-@ trau@@ matic hip frac@@ tures the administration of the in@@ fusion of A@@ cl@@ asta is recommended two or more weeks after surgical treatment of hip frac@@ tures ( see Section 5.1 ) .
for the treatment of Pa@@ get &apos;s disease , A@@ cl@@ asta should be prescribed only by doctors who have experience in the treatment of the Pa@@ get Mor@@ bus .
after treatment of the Pa@@ get &apos;s disease with A@@ cl@@ asta , a long re@@ mission period was observed in patients who responded to the therapy ( see Section 5.1 ) .
in addition , it is highly advisable to ensure an adequate intake of calcium in patients with mor@@ bus pa@@ get , corresponding twice daily at least 500 mg of basic calcium , for at least 10 days after the administration of A@@ cl@@ asta ( see section 4.4 ) .
in patients with a recent low @-@ trau@@ matic hip fra@@ cture , an initial dose of 50,000 to 125@@ .000 I.@@ U. oral or intra@@ muscular vitamin D is recommended before the first A@@ cl@@ asta in@@ fusion .
the frequency of symptoms occurring within the first three days after the administration of A@@ cl@@ asta can be reduced by offering par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol or i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen shortly after use of A@@ cl@@ asta .
patients with kidney function disorder ( see section 4.4 ) In patients with a cre@@ at@@ in@@ in Clear@@ ance &lt; 35 ml / min A@@ cl@@ asta is not recommended as limited clinical experience for this group of patients is present .
older patients ( ≥ 65 years ) A dose adjustment is not necessary because bio@@ availability , distribution and elimination in older patients are similar to younger ones .
children and adolescents of A@@ cl@@ asta are not recommended for use in children and adolescents under 18 years of age because data on safety and efficacy are missing .
A@@ cl@@ asta is not recommended in patients with severe ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in Clear@@ ance &lt; 35 ml / min ) as a limited clinical experience exists for this patient population .
pre@@ existing hypo@@ kal@@ emia is to be treated with A@@ cl@@ asta before starting therapy with sufficient intake of calcium and vitamin D ( see Section 4.3 ) .
due to the quick insertion of the effect of Zol@@ t@@ ron@@ ics on bone conversion , a temporary , occasionally sympt@@ om@@ atic hypo@@ kal@@ emia can develop , the maximum occurs usually within the first 10 days after the in@@ fusion of A@@ cl@@ asta ( see section 4.8 ) .
in addition , it is highly advisable to ensure an adequate intake of calcium in patients with mor@@ bus pa@@ get , corresponding twice daily at least 500 mg of basic calcium , for at least 10 days after the administration of A@@ cl@@ asta ( see section 4.2 ) .
cancer , chemotherapy , treatment with cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids , poor oral hygiene should be considered before using bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates with appropriate preventive tooth treatment .
for patients who need dental surgery , no data is available whether the inter@@ ruption of treatment with bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates reduces the risk of o@@ ste@@ on@@ ec@@ ro@@ sis in the jaw area .
the clinical evaluation by the treating physician should be the basis for the treatment plan of each patient and based on an individual benefit risk assessment .
the frequency of symptoms occurring within the first three days after administration of A@@ cl@@ asta can be reduced by offering par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol or i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen shortly after use of A@@ cl@@ asta ( see section 4.2 ) .
cases of atri@@ al fibr@@ ill@@ ation reported as a serious adverse event were increased ( 1.3 % ) ( 51 of 3,@@ 8@@ 62 ) compared to patients receiving plac@@ ebo ( 0,6 % ) ( 22 by 3,@@ 8@@ 52 ) .
in o@@ steopor@@ osis studies ( PFT , HOR@@ I@@ Z@@ ON - Rec@@ ur@@ rent Fra@@ cture Trial &#91; R@@ FT &#93; ) , the overall frequency of atri@@ al fibr@@ ill@@ ation between A@@ cl@@ asta ( 2.6 % ) and plac@@ ebo ( 2.1 % ) was comparable .
very common ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) , occasional ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) , rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 , &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) adverse drug interactions are listed in Table 1 .
kidney function disorder Zol@@ t@@ ron@@ ics has been associated with ren@@ al function disorders , which have been associated as a decrease in ren@@ al function ( i.e. an increase in ser@@ um cre@@ at@@ in@@ ine ) and in rare cases as acute ren@@ al failure .
the change in the Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in Clear@@ ance ( measured annually before administration ) and the occurrence of kidney failure and a restricted kidney function were in a clinical trial for o@@ steopor@@ osis over three years comparable to the A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a- and plac@@ ebo group .
a temporary increase in ser@@ um cre@@ at@@ in@@ ine within 10 days of the administration was observed in 1.8 % of the patients treated with A@@ cl@@ asta versus 0.8 % of the patients treated with plac@@ ebo .
based on the evaluation of the laboratory findings , the temporary asy@@ mpt@@ om@@ atic calcium levels , which were below the normal fluctu@@ ation range ( less than 2.@@ 10 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) , were up to 21 % of patients treated with A@@ cl@@ asta in the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get studies .
all patients received sufficient amounts of vitamin D and calcium in the post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al o@@ steopor@@ osis study , in the study to prevent recur@@ rent clinical frac@@ tures after hip frac@@ tures and in the mor@@ bus pa@@ get studies ( see section 4.2 ) .
in the study to avoid clinical frac@@ tures after a recently frac@@ tured hip fra@@ cture , the vitamin D levels were not rout@@ inely measured , but the majority of patients received an initial dose of vitamin D before administration of A@@ cl@@ asta ( see section 4.2 ) .
local reactions after the administration of Zol@@ t@@ ron@@ ics in a large clinical study was reported on local reactions to the fusion site , such as redness , swelling and / or pain , ( 0.7 % ) .
o@@ ste@@ on@@ ek@@ ro@@ sis in the sl@@ ate area was deliber@@ ated , especially in cancer patients , via o@@ ste@@ on@@ ek@@ ro@@ sis ( primarily in the jaw area ) reported with bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates , including Zol@@ t@@ ron@@ ics , were treated .
many of these patients had signs of local infections including o@@ ste@@ omyel@@ itis , and most of the reports relate to cancer patients after tooth extraction or other dental attacks .
7 Study with 7,@@ 7@@ 36 patients showed O@@ ste@@ on@@ ec@@ ro@@ sis in the max@@ illary region in a patient treated with A@@ cl@@ asta and plac@@ ebo treated patients .
in case of over@@ dosing , which leads to clin@@ ically relevant hypo@@ kal@@ emia , a compensation of oral calcium and / or intra@@ ven@@ ous in@@ fusion of calcium glu@@ con@@ ate can be achieved .
clinical effectiveness in the treatment of post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al o@@ steopor@@ osis ( PFT ) The efficacy and safety of A@@ cl@@ asta 5 mg once a year for three consecutive years was shown with either a bone density ( BM@@ D ) T @-@ S@@ core for the Sch@@ enk@@ el@@ h@@ than ≤ -@@ 2.5 with or without any signs of an existing verteb@@ ral fra@@ cture .
effects on morph@@ ometric verteb@@ ral frac@@ tures A@@ cl@@ asta lowered significantly over a period of three years and already after one year the frequency of one or more new verteb@@ ral frac@@ tures ( see Table 2 ) .
A@@ cl@@ asta @-@ treated patients from 75 years and older had a 60 % reduced risk of verteb@@ ral frac@@ tures compared to plac@@ ebo patients ( p &lt; 0.0@@ 001 ) .
effects on hip frac@@ tures A@@ cl@@ asta showed a lasting effect over three years , which resulted in a reduced risk of hip frac@@ tures in a 41 % ( 95 % CI , 17 % to 58 % ) .
effect on bone density ( BM@@ D ) A@@ cl@@ asta increased bone density on lum@@ bar verteb@@ ra@@ ic acid , hip and dist@@ al radius compared to plac@@ ebo treatment significantly at all time points ( 6 , 12 , 24 and 36 months ) .
9 Incre@@ ase the bone density of the lum@@ bar spine by 6.@@ 7 % , the total hip by 6.0 % , the lower thig@@ h by 5.1 % and the dist@@ al radius by 3.2 % .
bone hist@@ ology in 152 post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al o@@ steopor@@ otic patients treated with A@@ cl@@ asta ( N = 82 ) or plac@@ ebo ( N = 70 ) were taken from the pel@@ vis after the third annual dose of bone bi@@ op@@ si@@ es .
a micro@@ computer tom@@ ography ( µ@@ CT ) analysis showed an increase in the tra@@ bec@@ ular bone volume compared with plac@@ ebo and the preservation of the tra@@ bec@@ ular bone architecture compared to plac@@ ebo .
bone @-@ specific alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase ( B@@ SAP ) , the N @-@ termin@@ ale pro@@ pep@@ tide of the type I@@ - col@@ lagen ( P@@ 1@@ NP ) in ser@@ um and the beta @-@ C @-@ tel@@ op@@ ep@@ tide ( b @-@ CT@@ x ) in ser@@ um were determined in sub @-@ groups of 5@@ 17 to 1,@@ 246 patients in periodi@@ c intervals during the study period .
the treatment with an annual 5 mg dose of A@@ cl@@ asta reduced B@@ SAP after 12 months significantly by 30 % compared to the initial value and was kept at 28 % below the initial value up to 36 months .
P@@ 1@@ NP was significantly reduced by 61 % below the initial value after 12 months and was kept at 52 % below the initial value up to 36 months .
B @-@ CT@@ x was significantly reduced by 61 % below the initial value after 12 months and was kept at 55 % below the initial value up to 36 months .
the vitamin D levels were not rout@@ inely measured , but the majority of patients received an initial dose of vitamin D ( 50,000 to 125@@ .000 I.@@ U. oral or intra@@ muscular ) 2 weeks prior to in@@ fusion .
total mort@@ ality was 10 % ( 101 patients ) in the group treated with A@@ cl@@ asta compared with 13 % ( 141 patients ) in the plac@@ ebo group .
effect on bone mineral density ( BM@@ D ) In the HOR@@ I@@ Z@@ ON @-@ R@@ FT study , the A@@ cl@@ asta treatment in comparison to plac@@ ebo treatment increased the BM@@ D on the overall shaft and thig@@ h at all time points .
the A@@ cl@@ asta treatment led over 24 months compared to plac@@ ebo treatment to increase the BM@@ D by 5.4 % on the overall balance and by 4.3 % at the neck .
clinical efficacy in men In the HOR@@ I@@ Z@@ ON @-@ R@@ FT study , 508 were random@@ ised and 185 patients evaluated the BM@@ D after 24 months .
the study was not designed to show a reduction in men &apos;s clinical c@@ tures ; the incidence of clinical frac@@ tures was 7.5 % in A@@ cl@@ asta @-@ treated males versus 8.@@ 7 % in plac@@ ebo .
in another study in men ( study CZ@@ OL@@ 4@@ 46@@ M@@ 230@@ 8 ) , the annual administration of A@@ cl@@ asta compared to the once weekly administration of al@@ end@@ ron@@ at was not inferior to the percentage change of the lum@@ bar verteb@@ ra@@ e BM@@ D after 24 months compared to the initial value .
clinical efficacy of the treatment at Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get of the bone A@@ cl@@ asta was examined in patients aged over 30 years with radi@@ ologically confirmed , especially light to moder@@ ately heavy mor@@ bus Pa@@ get of the bone ( medium ser@@ um levels of alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase according to the 2.@@ 6@@ fold up to 3,@@ 0@@ fold age @-@ specific upper normal value when recording in the study ) .
11 The efficacy of an in@@ fusion of 5 mg of Zol@@ t@@ ron@@ ic acid in comparison to taking 30 mg of Ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ at once daily for 2 months has been demonstrated in two six months comparative studies .
the combined results showed a similar decrease in pain intensity and pain influ@@ encing compared to the initial value for A@@ cl@@ asta and Ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ at .
patients who were classified as Respon@@ der at the end of the six month study ( responded to the therapy ) could be included in an observ@@ ational phase .
of the 143 patients treated with A@@ cl@@ asta and 107 patients treated with Ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ at , the therapeutic response from 141 of patients treated with Ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ at could be maintained in an average duration of the follow @-@ up period of 18 months after the application .
one @-@ time and multiple 5 and 15 minutes of continuous in@@ fusion of 2 , 4 , 8 and 16 m@@ g. of Zol@@ t@@ ron@@ ics in 64 patients showed the following pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic data , which proved to be dose @-@ independent .
then the plasma levels rapidly decrease to &lt; 10 % of the maximum value after 4 h and &lt; 1 % after 24 h , followed by a long @-@ lasting phase of very low concentration , no more than 0.1 % of the maximum value .
rapid bi@@ pha@@ sic dis@@ appearance from the large cycle with half @-@ life of ½ α 0.@@ 24 and t ½ β 1,@@ 87 hours followed by a long period of elimination with a terminal elimination of ½ g 146 hours .
the early distribution phases ( α and β , with the above t ½ -@@ values ) presum@@ ably represent the rapid absorption in the bones and ex@@ cre@@ tion over the kid@@ neys .
in the first 24 hours , 39 ± 16 % of the administered dose can be found in the urine while the rest is mainly bon@@ ded to bone tissue .
the total body Clear@@ ance is independent of the dose of 5,@@ 04 ± 2.5 l / h and remains un@@ affected by gender , age , race or body weight .
an extension of the in@@ fusion time of 5 to 15 minutes led to the decrease of the customs presence concentration at 30 % at the end of the in@@ fusion , but had no effect on the area below the curve ( plasma concentration against time ) .
a dimin@@ ished clearance of met@@ aboli@@ zed substances met@@ aboli@@ zed by cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom @-@ P@@ 450 enzyme systems is unlikely because Zol@@ t@@ ali@@ c acid is not met@@ aboli@@ zed by humans and because they are a weak or even no direct and / or ir@@ reversible , material @-@ dependent inhibit@@ or of the P@@ 450@@ -
special patient groups ( see section 4.2 ) The ren@@ al Clear@@ ance of Zol@@ t@@ ron@@ ics cor@@ related with the Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in Clear@@ ance , namely 75 ± 33 % of the Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in Clear@@ ance , and was 84 ± 29 ml / min for 64 patients studied ( range 22 to 143 ml / min ) .
this results in a light ( Cl@@ c@@ r = 50 @-@ 80 ml / min ) and moderate kidney dysfunction to down to a cre@@ at@@ in@@ in Clear@@ ance up to 35 ml / min no dosage adjustment of the Zol@@ t@@ ronic acid required .
since for severe kidney dysfunction ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in- Clear@@ ance &lt; 30 ml / min ) only limited data are available , no statements are possible for this population .
acute toxic@@ ity The highest intra@@ ven@@ ous intra@@ ven@@ ous single dose in mice was 10 mg / kg of body weight and at rats 0.6 mg / kg body weight .
in studies in dogs , single doses of 1.0 mg / kg ( based on AU@@ C were 6 times the recommended human @-@ therapeutic exposure ) , administered over a period of 15 minutes , good and without a ren@@ al influence .
chronic and chronic toxic@@ ity In studies with intra@@ ven@@ ous application , the ren@@ al toler@@ ability of Zol@@ t@@ ron@@ ics was determined in rats by taking doses of 0.6 mg / kg as a 15 @-@ minute in@@ fusion in 3 @-@ day intervals , administered in intervals of 2- 3 weeks ( a cum@@ ulative dose equivalent to the multiple of human @-@ therapeutic exposure , related to the AU@@ C , equivalent ) , well toler@@ ated .
in long @-@ term studies with repeated use in cum@@ ulated ex@@ positions which exceeded the maximum of the intended human exposure , toxic@@ ological effects on other organs including the g@@ astro@@ intestinal tract and the liver and the intra@@ ven@@ ous injection point occurred .
the most common finding in trials involving repeated use was an increased primary spon@@ gi@@ osa in the met@@ aphy@@ sis of long bones in animals in the growth phase with almost all dos@@ ages , a finding that reflects the pharmac@@ ological , anti @-@ res@@ or@@ tive effect of the substance .
rats observed a ter@@ at@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity in dos@@ ages from 0.2 mg / kg as external and inner ( vis@@ cer@@ al ) ab@@ norm@@ alities and such of skel@@ eton .
no ter@@ at@@ ogenic effects or embryo @-@ fet@@ al effects were observed in ra@@ bb@@ its , although the mat@@ ernal toxic@@ ity was pronounced at 0.1 mg / kg as a result of the low ser@@ um calcium level .

Zol@@ t@@ ron@@ ics is a substance class representative , called bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates , and is used for the treatment of o@@ steopor@@ osis in post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al women , o@@ steopor@@ osis in men and the bone of the bone .
decl@@ ining blood levels of sex hormones , especially est@@ ro@@ gens that are made from and@@ ro@@ gens , play a role in the rather gradual loss of bone mass observed in men .
at the Pa@@ get &apos;s disease , bone reconstruction takes place too fast , and new bone material is built up un@@ ordered , which makes the bone material weaker than normal .
Bast@@ a works by restor@@ ing the bone structure again , ensuring normal bone formation and thus gives strength to the bone .
if you are in dental treatment or undergo a dental surgery , tell your doctor that you are treated with A@@ cl@@ asta .
if you are using A@@ cl@@ asta with other medicines , please inform your doctor , pharmac@@ ist or nursing staff if you have taken / applied other medicines or have been taken / applied recently , even if it is not prescription medicine .
for your doctor , it is particularly important to know if you are taking medicines that are known to harm the kid@@ neys .
when using A@@ cl@@ asta together with food and drink , worry that according to your doctor &apos;s instructions , you will have enough liquid before and after treatment with A@@ cl@@ asta .
o@@ steopor@@ osis The usual dose is 5 mg once a year , which is administered by your doctor or nursing staff as in@@ fusion to a v@@ ein .
if you have recently frac@@ tured the hip , it is recommended to administ@@ er A@@ cl@@ asta two or more weeks following the surgical treatment of the hip frac@@ tures .
the usual dose is 5 mg administered by your doctor or nursing staff as in@@ fusion to a v@@ ein .
as A@@ cl@@ asta affects a long time , if necessary , you will need another dose only after one year or longer .
it is important to follow these instructions carefully so that the calcium level in your blood is not too low in time after in@@ fusion .
at Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , A@@ cl@@ asta can work for more than a year , and your doctor will inform you if you need another treatment .
if the administration of A@@ cl@@ asta has been missed , contact your doctor or hospital immediately to arrange a new appointment .
before ending the therapy with A@@ cl@@ asta If you consider the completion of treatment with A@@ cl@@ asta , please take your next medical appointment and discuss it with your doctor .
side effects associated with the first in@@ fusion occur very frequently ( with more than 30 % of patients ) , but are less frequent after the inf@@ usions .
fever and ch@@ ills , muscle or joint pain and head@@ ache , occur within the first three days after the administration of A@@ cl@@ asta .
at present , it is un@@ clear whether A@@ cl@@ asta causes this irregular heart@@ beat , but you should report it to your doctor if you notice such symptoms after you have received A@@ cl@@ asta .

please inform your doctor , pharmac@@ ist or nursing staff if any of the listed side effects may significantly affect you or notice side effects that are not listed in this use information .
if the medicine is not used immediately , the user is responsible for the storage time and conditions up to the application ; normally , 24 h should not be exceeded at 2 ° C to 8 ° C .
patients with a recent low @-@ trau@@ matic hip frac@@ tures are recommended to perform the in@@ fusion of A@@ cl@@ asta two or more weeks after the surgical treatment of hip frac@@ tures .
before and after administration of A@@ cl@@ asta , patients must be sufficiently supplied with fluid ; this is particularly important in patients receiving di@@ ure@@ tic therapy .
due to the quick insertion of the effect of Zol@@ t@@ ron@@ ic acid on bone conversion , a temporary , sometimes sympt@@ om@@ atically running , hypo@@ kal@@ emia develops whose maximum occurs usually within the first 10 days after the in@@ fusion of A@@ cl@@ asta .
in addition , it is highly advisable to ensure an adequate intake of calcium in patients with mor@@ bus pa@@ get , according to at least twice daily 500 mg of elem@@ ental calcium , for at least 10 days after the administration of A@@ cl@@ asta .
in patients with a recent low @-@ trau@@ matic hip fra@@ cture , an initial dose of 50,000 to 125@@ .000 I.@@ E. or@@ al or intra@@ muscular vitamin D is recommended prior to the in@@ fusion of A@@ cl@@ asta .

in addition , four studies were conducted in more than 7@@ 0,000 patients in which A@@ comp@@ lia was used as a supp@@ or@@ tive agent in comparison to plac@@ ebo .
on the other hand , studies on setting smoking did not show uniform results , so that the effect of A@@ comp@@ lia was difficult to assess in this field of application .
what risk is associated with A@@ comp@@ lia ? er The most common side effects of A@@ comp@@ lia which were detected during trials ( observed in more than 1 out of 10 patients ) were nausea and infections of upper respiratory tract . n@@ g The complete list of side effects reported in the context of A@@ comp@@ lia is the package insert .
it may not be used in patients suffering from an existing severe depression or being treated with anti@@ de@@ press@@ ants , as it increases the risk of depression and , among other things , can cause su@@ ici@@ dal thoughts among a small minority of patients .

we examined the over@@ weight patients and in patients with obesity , and in addition to 38@@ 00 patients in further indications .
the following table ( Table 1 ) shows the adverse effects of plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled trials in patients treated for weight reduction and accompanying metabolic diseases .
it was statisti@@ cally significantly higher than the corresponding plac@@ eb@@ or@@ ates ( for un@@ desirable effects ≥ 1 % ) or if they were clin@@ ically relevant ( for unwanted effects &lt; 1 % ) . NG In evaluating side effects the following frequency are basically laid :
very common ( ≥ 10 % ) ; often ( ≥ 1 , &lt; 10 % ) ; occasionally ( ≥ 0.1 , &lt; 1 % ) ; rare ( ≥ 0.01 , &lt; 0.1 % ) ; very t l@@ ä
only slight symptoms were observed in a toler@@ ability study , in which a limited number of people were administered by up to 300 mg .
patients had an BM@@ I ≥ 30 kg / m ² or BM@@ I &gt; 27 kg / m ² and an existing hyper@@ tension and / or dy@@ sli@@ p@@ ide@@ mia .
N weight reduction after one year was 20 mg 6.5 kg , relative to the initial value , compared to 1.6 kg for the plac@@ ebo group ( difference -@@ 4.@@ 9 kg CI@@ 95 % -@@ 5.3 ; -@@ 4,4 , p &lt; 0.0@@ 01 ) .

5.3 Pre@@ clinical data for safety of the following adverse effects that were not observed in clinical studies , but which were n@@ g in animals after exposure to the human therapeutic area , were considered to be relevant for clinical use :
in some , however , not in all cases the beginning of conv@@ ul@@ sions seems to be associated with proced@@ ural stress such as dealing with the animals .
Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant was given over a longer period before the mat@@ ing ( 9 weeks ) , which allowed a recovery from the initial effects of Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant so no adverse effects were observed on the fertility or cycle distur@@ ban@@ ces .
the influence of Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant on pre@@ - and post@@ nat@@ al development was studied at the rat in doses of up to 10 mg / kg / day .
in a study of rats for pre@@ - and post@@ nat@@ al development , exposure to Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant in uter@@ o and by lac@@ tation caused no changes in learning behaviour or memory .

summary of the EP@@ AR for the public The present document is a summary of the European Public Assessment Report ( EP@@ AR ) , which explains how the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) has assessed the studies carried out to make recommendations regarding the use of the drug .
Ac@@ tos is used to treat type 2 diabetes ( also known as non @-@ insulin @-@ dependent diabetes ) . • It can be applied alone ( mon@@ otherapy ) in patients ( particularly over@@ weight patients ) in which met@@ form@@ in ( a diabetes medication ) is not indicated .
in addition to met@@ form@@ in in patients ( particularly over@@ weight patients ) , met@@ form@@ in alone can not be satisfactory in the highest toler@@ able dose alone .
in combination with sul@@ f@@ ony@@ lu@@ rea or insulin , the previous dose of the sul@@ f@@ ony@@ lu@@ rea or insulin can be maintained at the beginning of the Ac@@ tos treatment , except for patients with hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia ( low blood sugar ) ; here , the dose of the sul@@ f@@ onic acid or insulin should be reduced .
this means that the body &apos;s own insulin can be better utilized and blood sugar levels are reduced and type 2 diabetes can be better adjusted .
in more than 1 400 patients the efficacy of Ac@@ tos was studied in triple therapy ; patients received a combination of met@@ form@@ in with sul@@ fon@@ yl@@ res@@ ins , in addition they received either Ac@@ tos or plac@@ ebo for up to 3.5 years .
in the studies the concentration of a substance in the blood ( gly@@ cos@@ yl@@ ated hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in , H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) was measured , indicating how well the blood sugar is adjusted .
Ac@@ tos resulted in a reduction in the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c value , suggest@@ ing that the blood sugar levels were reduced in the application of 15 mg , 30 mg and 45 mg doses .
at the end of the tri@@ ple@@ therapy study , the effect of an additional application of Ac@@ tos for the existing treatment with met@@ form@@ in and sul@@ phon@@ ylene was 0.@@ 94 % , while the additional administration of plac@@ ebo resulted in a reduction of 0.@@ 35 % .
in a small study in which the combination of Ac@@ tos and insulin was examined in 289 patients , the patients , in addition to insulin , decreased the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c values of 0.@@ 69 % after 6 months , compared with 0.@@ 14 % in the patients who took plac@@ ebo .
the most common side effects associated with Ac@@ tos were vision distur@@ ban@@ ces , upper respiratory infections ( col@@ ds ) , weight gain , and an@@ aes@@ thes@@ ia ( reduced sensitivity to irrit@@ ation ) .
Ac@@ tos can neither be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one or one of the other components , or in patients with liver problems , heart failure or di@@ ab@@ etic k@@ eto@@ aci@@ dosis ( high ket@@ one level - acid levels - in the blood ) .
it was decided that Ac@@ tos is supposed to serve as an alternative to the standard treatment with met@@ form@@ in in patients with which met@@ form@@ in is not indicated .
in October 2000 , the European Commission granted the tak@@ eover of Ac@@ tos in the entire European Union to Tak@@ eda Europe R &amp; D Centre Limited .
the tablets are white to whi@@ tish , round , arch@@ ed and carry on one side the marker &quot; 15 &quot; and on the other side the in@@ scription &quot; Ac@@ tos . &quot;
Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one is also indicated for the combination of insulin in patients with type 2 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus , whose blood sugar is inadequate with insulin and in which met@@ form@@ in is in@@ appropriate due to contra@@ indications or int@@ oler@@ ance ( see section 4.4 ) .
there are no data available to use pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one in patients under 18 years of age , therefore the application in this age group is not recommended .
in patients who are at risk of at least one risk factor ( e.g. previous heart attack or sympt@@ om@@ atic cor@@ on@@ ary heart disease ) to develop a de@@ compens@@ ated heart failure , the doctor should start the treatment with the lowest available dose and gradually increase the dose .
patients should be observed on signs and symptoms of heart failure , weight gain or ede@@ ma , especially those with reduced cardiac reserve .
patients should be observed on signs and symptoms of heart failure , weight gain and ede@@ ma when pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one is applied in combination with insulin .
a cardiovascular outcome study with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one in patients under 75 years with type 2 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus and pre@@ existing advanced mac@@ rov@@ ascular disease was performed .
this study showed an increase in the reports on heart failure , which did not lead to an increase in mort@@ ality in the study .
in patients with increased output of liver enzymes ( AL@@ T &gt; 2.5 x upper limit of the normal range ) or with other signs of liver disease , pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one may not be used .
if the AL@@ T levels are increased by up to 3 times the upper limit of the normal range , the liver enzymes will be checked again as soon as possible .
if a patient develops symptoms that point to h@@ ep@@ atic dysfunction , such as un@@ explained nausea , vom@@ iting , up@@ set stomach problems , fatigue , loss of appetite and / or dark urine , the liver enzymes are to be checked .
the decision whether the treatment of the patient is continued with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one should be guided by clinical evaluation until the clinical trial has been submitted .
in clinical trials with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one , a dose @-@ dependent weight gain has been demonstrated which can be caused by fatty deposits and in some cases linked to fluid retention .
a minor reduction in the mean hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in values ( relative reduction by 4 % ) and hem@@ at@@ ok@@ r@@ its ( relative reduction by 4.1 % ) occurred as a result of hem@@ odi@@ lution .
similar changes were observed in comparable controlled trials with pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one in patients under met@@ form@@ in ( relative reduction in hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in by 3 @-@ 4 % and hem@@ ato@@ cri@@ p@@ its by 1 @-@ 2 % and hem@@ ato@@ cri@@ p@@ its by 1 @-@ 3.2 % ) .
as a result of increased insulin sensitivity , there is a risk of dose @-@ dependent hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia in patients who receive Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one as oral two @-@ fold or triple @-@ combination therapy with a sul@@ f@@ ony@@ lu@@ rea or as a dual combination therapy with insulin .
after the market launch , a decrease in visual acu@@ ity was reported under the treatment with thi@@ az@@ oli@@ d@@ Indi@@ onen , including Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one , on the occurrence or deteri@@ oration of a di@@ ab@@ etic mac@@ ular ede@@ ma .
it is un@@ clear whether there is a direct connection between the taking of Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one and the occurrence of mac@@ ular ede@@ ma , but prescribed physicians should be aware of the possibility of a mac@@ ular ede@@ ma when patients report disorders of visual acu@@ ity ; a suitable ophthalm@@ ological examination should be considered .
in a summar@@ izing analysis of adverse events regarding bone frac@@ tures from random@@ ised , controlled , double @-@ blind clinical trials over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,@@ 100 patients treated with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one
the calculated fra@@ cture incidence was 1.9 frac@@ tures per 100 patient year in women treated with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one and 1.1 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years in women treated with a comparison medication .
in the Pro@@ Active study , a study of 3,5 years for the investigation of cardiovascular events , frac@@ tures occurred at 44 / 870 ( 5.1 % ; 1.0 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years ) of patients treated with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one ( 2.5 % ; 0.5 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years ) in patients treated with a comparison medication .
patients should be aware of the possibility of pregnancy and if a patient wishes to have a pregnancy or this occurs , the treatment must be dismis@@ sed ( see Section 4.6 ) .
studies on the study of interactions have shown that Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one does not have any relevant effects on the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics or pharmac@@ o@@ dynamics of dig@@ ox@@ in , war@@ far@@ in , phen@@ proc@@ ou@@ mon and met@@ form@@ in .
drug interactions that are met@@ aboli@@ zed by these enzymes , e.g. oral contra@@ cep@@ tives , cy@@ clos@@ por@@ ine , calcium channel blo@@ cker and H@@ M@@ G@@ Co@@ A reduc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ ors are not to be expected .
the simultaneous application of Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one with gem@@ fibro@@ zi@@ l ( a cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8@@ - inhibit@@ or ) resulted in an increase of the AU@@ C of Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one by 3 times .
the simultaneous application of Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on with Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in ( a Cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 2@@ C8 @-@ induc@@ tor ) resulted in a decrease of the AU@@ C of Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on by 54 % .
this is due to the fact that under treatment with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one the hyper@@ ins@@ ul@@ in@@ emia and increased insulin resistance of the parent is reduced , thereby reducing the availability of the metabolic sub@@ strates for the fet@@ al growth .
very common &gt; 1 / 10 ; common &gt; 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ; occasionally &gt; 1 / 1000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ; rare &gt; 1 / 10000 , &lt; 1 / 1000 ; very rare &lt; 1 / 10000 , single cases : unknown ( not estim@@ able from this data ) .
these lead to a temporary change in the turbine and the refra@@ ctive index of the lens , as observed in other hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic agents .
in clinical trials with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on , AL@@ T asc@@ ents of the tri@@ ples of the upper limit of the normal range were similar to plac@@ ebo , but less often than in comparison groups of met@@ form@@ in or sul@@ f@@ ony@@ lu@@ sion@@ al .
in an Out@@ come study in patients with pre@@ existing advanced mac@@ rov@@ ascular disease , the incidence of severe cardiac in@@ suffici@@ ency under Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one was 1.6 % higher than plac@@ ebo when Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on res@@ ides .
since the market launch has rarely been reported on cardiac in@@ suffici@@ ency under Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one , however , if Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one was used in combination with insulin or in patients with con@@ ges@@ tive heart failure in the an@@ am@@ n@@ esis .
a summary analysis of adverse events regarding bone frac@@ tures from random@@ ised , controlled , double @-@ blind clinical trials over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,@@ 100 patients in the groups treated with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one and over 7,@@ 400 patients in the groups treated with comparison medication .
in the Pro@@ Active study running over a period of 3.5 years , frac@@ tures yiel@@ ded 44 / 870 ( 5.1 % ) of patients treated with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one , compared with 23 / 90@@ 5 ( 2.5 % ) in patients treated with a comparison medication .
when taking the reported maximum dose of 120 mg / day over four days , then 180 mg / day over seven days did not show any symptoms .
Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one seems to have activated activated carbon recept@@ ors ( per@@ ox@@ is@@ ome prolifer@@ ation activated Rec@@ ep@@ tor @-@ γ ( PP@@ AR @-@ γ ) ) , leading to increased insulin sensitivity of liver , fat and skel@@ etal muscle cells in the animal model .
it could be shown that Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one reduces glucose production in the liver and increases peripheral glucose consumption in the event of insulin resistance .
a clinical study with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on versus Gli@@ cl@@ azi@@ d as a mon@@ otherapy was continued over two years in order to investigate the time until the therapeutic effect was confirmed ( defined as H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ≥ 8.0 % after the first 6 months of treatment ) .
at the time of two years after the beginning of the therapy , a blood glucose control ( defined as H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c &lt; 8.0 % ) was maintained by Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on in 69 % of the patients treated ( compared to 50 % of the patients under gli@@ cl@@ azi@@ d ) .
in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled study of 12 months , patients whose blood sugar had been inadequate with insulin in spite of three months of improvement phase were random@@ ized to Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one or plac@@ ebo .
in patients with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one , the mean H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c decreased by 0.@@ 45 % compared to the patients who continued to receive insulin ; a reduction in insulin dosage in the group treated with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one was observed .
in clinical trials over a year , a statisti@@ cally significant decrease in the alb@@ um@@ in / cre@@ at@@ in@@ in quot@@ i@@ ents showed a statisti@@ cally significant decrease compared to the bas@@ eline values .
the effect of Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one ( mon@@ otherapy with 45 mg versus plac@@ ebo ) was tested in a small , 18 week study of type 2 di@@ ab@@ etic patients .
in most clinical trials compared to plac@@ ebo , a reduction in total plasma tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ des and free fatty acids and an increase in HD@@ L cholesterol levels and in@@ significant , but clin@@ ically not significantly increased L@@ DL cholesterol levels have been observed .
in clinical trials over a period of up to two years , Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one reduced total plas@@ mat@@ ri@@ ol gly@@ c@@ eri@@ des and free fatty acids and increased the HD@@ L Chol@@ ester@@ insp@@ iegel in comparison with plac@@ ebo , met@@ form@@ in or gli@@ cl@@ asia .
in comparison to plac@@ ebo , no statisti@@ cally significant increase in L@@ DL cholesterol was observed under Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one , while reduced values were observed under met@@ form@@ in and gli@@ cl@@ azi@@ de .
in a study of over 20 weeks , Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on reduced not only the gro@@ c@@ et tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ des but also improved tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eride level , which has an effect on tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eride absorption and h@@ ep@@ atic tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eride synthesis .
in the Pro@@ Active study , a cardiovascular outcome study , 5@@ 238 patients with type 2 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus and pre @-@ existing advanced mac@@ rov@@ ascular disease were random@@ ised to receive either pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one or plac@@ ebo over a period of up to 3.5 years .
according to oral application , Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one is absorbed quickly , whereby the peak concentrations of un@@ altered Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on in plasma are usually achieved 2 hours after application .
this is based on the contribution of M @-@ IV to effectiveness in roughly three @-@ times the efficacy of Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one , while the relative efficacy of M @-@ II is minimal .
in interaction studies , it was possible to demonstrate that Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on has no relevant effect on pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics or pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of dig@@ ox@@ in , war@@ far@@ in , phen@@ proc@@ ou@@ mon and met@@ form@@ in .
the simultaneous application of Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one with gem@@ fibro@@ zi@@ l ( a cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8@@ - In@@ hi@@ bit@@ or ) or with Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in ( a cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 2@@ C8 @-@ induc@@ tor ) increases or lo@@ wers the plasma concentration of Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one ( see section 4.5 ) .
after the oral application of radio@@ actively marked pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one in humans , the marker was found mainly in the rot ( 55 % ) and to a lesser extent in the urine ( 45 % ) .
the average plasma elimination of un@@ altered Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one is 5 @-@ 6 hours for humans , and the total active metabol@@ ites are 16 - 23 hours .
the plasma concentrations of pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one and its metabol@@ ites are lower in patients with reduced kidney function than in healthy subjects , but the rates of oral fluor@@ escence are similar .
toxic@@ ological studies coinci@@ ded with mice , rats , dogs and monkeys after repeated administration of plasma volume enlargement with hem@@ odi@@ lution , an@@ emia and reversible ec@@ centric heart hyper@@ tro@@ phy .
this is due to the fact that under treatment with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one the hyper@@ ins@@ ul@@ in@@ emia and increased insulin resistance of the parent is reduced , thereby reducing the availability of the metabolic sub@@ strates for the fet@@ al growth .
in long @-@ term studies ( up to 2 years ) , increased incidence of hyper@@ pl@@ asia ( in male and female rats ) and tum@@ ors ( in male rats ) of the bladder epithel@@ ium were induced .
in a animal model of the family aden@@ om@@ at@@ ous poly@@ posi@@ s ( FA@@ P ) the treatment with two other thi@@ az@@ oli@@ d@@ indi@@ ans led to an increased frequency of col@@ on tum@@ ors .
the tablets are white to whi@@ tish , round , flat and carry on one side the marker &quot; 30 &quot; and on the other side the in@@ scription &quot; Ac@@ tos . &quot;
the calculated fra@@ cture incidence was 1.9 frac@@ tures per 100 patient year in women treated with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one and 1.1 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years in women treated with a comparison medication .
in the Pro@@ Active study , a study of 3,5 years for the investigation of cardiovascular events , frac@@ tures occurred at 44 / 870 ( 5.1 % ; 1.0 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years ) of patients treated with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one ( 2.5 % ; 0.5 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years ) in patients treated with a comparison medication .
in another study for two years the effects of a combination therapy of met@@ form@@ in with either pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one or gli@@ cl@@ azi@@ de were investigated .
in clinical trials over one year , a statisti@@ cally significant decrease in the alb@@ um@@ in / cre@@ at@@ in@@ in quot@@ i@@ ents showed a statisti@@ cally significant decrease compared to the bas@@ eline values .
in a study of more than 20 weeks , Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on reduced not only the gro@@ c@@ eride tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ des but also improved the post@@ pran@@ dial elevated tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eride level , which has an effect on the tr@@ y@@ gly@@ c@@ eride absorption as well as the h@@ ep@@ atic Tr@@ y@@ g@@ lic@@ eri@@ d synthesis .
although the study missed the target with regard to its primary end@@ point , which presented a combination of the total mort@@ ality , non @-@ fatal m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction , stroke , acute cor@@ on@@ ary syndrome , leg amp@@ utation above the ank@@ le , cor@@ on@@ ary vas@@ cul@@ ari@@ zation and re@@ visions of the leg arter@@ ies , the results suggest that with the intake of Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on there are no cardiovascular long @-@ term risks .

Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane was studied in a total of 29@@ 4 patients with type 1 diabetes , in which the pancre@@ as cannot produce insulin , and type 2 diabetes , in which the body is unable to effectively use insulin .
in the study , the concentration of a substance ( gly@@ cos@@ yl@@ ated hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in ( H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) was measured after 12 weeks , indicating how well the blood sugar is adjusted .
Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane introduced a decrease in the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c mirror , suggest@@ ing that blood sugar levels were lowered similar to that of another human insulin .
Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane should not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to human insulin ( r@@ DNA ) or any of the other components .
in addition , the doses of Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane must be adjusted if it is administered together with a number of other medicines which can affect blood sugar ( the complete list is to be found in the package insert ) .
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that the benefits of Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane out@@ weigh the risks of diabetes .
in October 2002 , the European Commission granted the company Nov@@ o Nor@@ disk A / S approval for the placing of Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane in the entire European Union .
pre@@ mixed insulin @-@ products are usually applied once or twice a day when a rapid initial effect is desired along with a longer lasting effect .
the injection needle must be left under the skin for at least 6 seconds to ensure that the entire dose was inj@@ ected .
for example , patients whose blood sugar level has significantly improved by intensi@@ fied insulin therapy can perceive hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia warning symptoms and should be advised accordingly .
any change regarding strength , brand ( manufacturer ) , insulin type ( fast acting , bi@@ pha@@ sic , long acting insulin , etc . ) , type of insulin ( animal insulin , human insulin or insulin analog ) and / or manufacturing method ( due to re@@ combin@@ ant DNA to insulin @-@ animal origin ) may cause a change in dosage .
if a dose adjustment is necessary when switching to Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane in the patient , it may be necessary at the first dose or in the first weeks or months after the transition .
some patients with hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic reactions following a switch from animal to human insulin reported that early warning symptoms of hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia were less pronounced or different from their previous insulin .
before travelling , which go over several time zones , the patient should be advised to take the advice of his doctor as such journeys may cause insulin and meals to be applied or taken at other times .
the doctor must therefore consider potential interactions during therapy and always ask his patients for other medications taken by them .

Ac@@ tra@@ pi@@ d may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive to insulin human ( r@@ DNA ) or any of the other components .
in addition , the doses of Ac@@ tro@@ pi@@ d may need to be adjusted if it is administered together with a number of other medicines which can affect blood sugar .
in October 2002 , the European Commission granted the company Nov@@ o Nor@@ disk A / S approval for the transport of Ac@@ tra@@ pi@@ d across the European Union .
when two types of insulin are mixed , first the amount of the rapidly acting insulin has to be re@@ ared , followed by the amount of the long acting insulin .
3 In case of change to ac@@ tra@@ p@@ d in the patient a dosage adjustment is necessary , it may be necessary at the first dose or in the first weeks or months after the conversion .
before travelling , which go over several time zones , the patient should be advised to take the advice of his doctor as such journeys may cause insulin and meals to be applied or taken at other times .

the effect begins within half an hour , the maximum effect is reached within 1.5 to 3.5 hours and the total active duration amounts to approximately 7 to 8 hours .
the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic profile of Ac@@ tra@@ p@@ d was studied at a smaller number ( n = 18 ) di@@ ab@@ etic children ( ages 6 @-@ 12 ) and adolescents ( ages 13 @-@ 17 ) .
the data is limited but suggests that the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic profile in children and adolescents is similar to that of adults .

aden@@ ur@@ ic is used in patients showing signs of cryst@@ alli@@ zation , including arthritis ( pain and inflammation in joints ) or g@@ out ( &quot; stones &quot; i.e. larger elem@@ ental cryst@@ alli@@ zation that can lead to joint and bone damage ) .
if the ur@@ ic acid levels are still more than 6 mg per dec@@ il@@ iter after two to four weeks , the dose can be increased to 120 mg once a day .
during the first treatment months , rheum@@ atism may still occur , and it is recommended that patients with aden@@ ur@@ ic treatment and other medicines are still used to prevent g@@ out attacks during the first six months of treatment .
the medicine is not recommended in children and in patients who had an organ transplan@@ t , as it was not studied for these groups .
in the first study , in which 1 0@@ 72 patients participated , three different aden@@ ur@@ ic dos@@ ages ( once daily 80 , 120 and 240 mg ) were compared with the plac@@ ebo ( hypo@@ c@@ emia ) and Allo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol ( another drug for the treatment of hyper@@ ur@@ ic@@ emia ) .
in the second study , two doses of aden@@ ur@@ ic ( once daily 80 and 120 mg ) were compared to 7@@ 62 patients each with Allo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol .
in both studies , allo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol was used in a dose of 300 mg once a day ; patients with kidney problems received only 100 mg per day .
the main indicator for efficacy was the number of patients whose ur@@ ic acid levels were lower than 6 mg / dl during the last three measurements .
in the first study , 48 % ( 126 of 262 ) patients who received 80 mg at a dose of 80 mg once a day and 65 % ( 175 of 26@@ 9 ) had a ur@@ ic acid level in the blood of less than 6 mg / dl during the last three measurements .
compared to this , this was the case with 22 % ( 60 of 268 ) of the patients under Allo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol and none of the 134 patients under Plac@@ ebo .
the most common side effects of aden@@ ur@@ ic ( observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are head@@ aches , diarr@@ ho@@ ea , nausea ( nausea ) , rash and abnormal liver enzymes .
especially in patients suffering from cardiac problems in pre@@ history , there may be an increased risk of certain side effects affecting the heart and blood vessels .
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that Aden@@ ur@@ ic was more effective in lowering the ur@@ ic acid levels in the blood than Allo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol , but could also have a higher risk of side effects associated with the heart and blood vessels .
treatment of chronic hyper@@ ur@@ ic@@ emia in diseases that have already led to urine deposits ( including one from the medical history of known or currently present g@@ out node and / or arthritis ) .
if the ser@@ um acid level is still &gt; 6 mg / dl ( 3@@ 57 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) after 2 @-@ 4 weeks , a dose increase can be taken into account at A@@ DEN@@ UR@@ IC 120 mg 1 x daily .
in patients with severe ren@@ al impair@@ ment , efficacy and safety have not been fully investigated ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in- Clear@@ ance &lt; 30 ml / min , see Section 5.2 ) .
children and adolescents since there is no experience in children and adolescents , the application of F@@ eb@@ lin@@ ux@@ ost@@ at is not recommended in this group of patients .
transplan@@ t recipi@@ ents Sin@@ ce there is no experience in organ transplan@@ t recei@@ vers , F@@ eb@@ lin@@ ux@@ at is not recommended in this group of patients ( see Section 5.1 ) .
cardiovascular diseases In patients with isch@@ em@@ ic heart disease or de@@ compens@@ ated heart failure , the treatment with F@@ eb@@ lin@@ ux@@ ost@@ at is not recommended ( see paragraph 4.8 ) .
like other har@@ dy @-@ acid medicines , it can cause acute rheum@@ atism during treatment , because the lowering of the ser@@ um acid acid can initially mobil@@ ise ur@@ ic acid deposits in the tissues .
B. for mal@@ ign@@ ant diseases and their treatment , Les@@ ch@@ - Ny@@ han @-@ Syndrome , the absolute concentration of X@@ an@@ thin in the urine in rare cases will increase so far that there is a de@@ position in the ur@@ inary tract .
during phase 3 clinical trials , slight ab@@ norm@@ alities of liver function values were observed in patients treated with F@@ eb@@ lin@@ ux@@ at ( 3.5 % ) .
it is therefore recommended to carry out a liver function test before starting f@@ ebru@@ ary and in the following course depending on clinical findings ( see Section 5.1 ) .
The@@ ophy@@ ll@@ in Z@@ entis did not conduct interaction studies on F@@ eb@@ lin@@ ux@@ at , but it is known that the X@@ O in@@ hibition can lead to a rise in the@@ ophy@@ l@@ line mirror ( an in@@ hibition of the@@ ophy@@ l@@ line metabolism was also reported for other X@@ O inhibit@@ ors ) .
in subjects the simultaneous administration of F@@ eb@@ lin@@ ux@@ ost@@ at and nap@@ ro@@ xen was associated with an increase in F@@ eb@@ lin@@ ux@@ ost@@ at exposure ( c@@ max 28 % , AU@@ C 41 % and t@@ 1 / 2 26 % ) .
in clinical studies , the use of nap@@ ro@@ xen or other N@@ SA@@ R / Co@@ x @-@ 2 inhibit@@ ors was not associated with a clin@@ ically significant increase in adverse events .
Col@@ ch@@ ic@@ in / In@@ dom@@ et@@ ac@@ in / Hydro@@ chlor@@ ite / War@@ far@@ in F@@ eb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at can be used together with Col@@ ch@@ ic@@ in or In@@ dom@@ et@@ ac@@ in without any dosage adjustment required for either F@@ eb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at or the other active ingredient used at the same time .
in a study involving subjects 120 mg A@@ DEN@@ UR@@ IC 1 x daily an average 22 % increase of the AU@@ C of Des@@ i@@ pra@@ mine , a CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 substrate , indicating a possible weak inhibit@@ ory effect of F@@ eb@@ lin@@ ux@@ at to the CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 enzyme in vi@@ vo .
ant@@ acid It could be shown that the simultaneous consumption of an an@@ ta@@ zi@@ d@@ um containing magnesium hydro@@ xi@@ de and aluminum hydro@@ xi@@ de , delays the absorption of f@@ eb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at ( about 1 hour ) and a decrease of c@@ max by 32 % , but no significant change in AU@@ C .
pregnancy data about a very limited number of exposed pregn@@ an@@ cies do not cause side effects of F@@ eb@@ lin@@ ux@@ ost@@ at to pregnancy or the health of the fet@@ us / new@@ born .
experimental studies do not cause direct or indirect adverse effects on pregnancy , embry@@ onic or fet@@ al development or birth ( see Section 5.3 ) .
patients should be careful when operating a vehicle , operating machines or exercising hazardous activities , until they can reasonably be sure that A@@ DEN@@ UR@@ IC does not adver@@ sely affect their performance .
a numer@@ ically higher incidence of cardiovascular events reported by the investig@@ ator was observed in the piv@@ otal Phase 3 piv@@ otal study ( 1.3 versus 0.3 events per 100 patient years ) and in long @-@ term extension studies ( 1.4 versus 0.7 events per 100 patient years ) , although no statistical significant differences were found and no caus@@ al correlation with F@@ eb@@ lin@@ ux@@ at could be detected .
the risk factors identified in these patients were an arter@@ i@@ os@@ cl@@ erotic disease and / or a m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction or de@@ compens@@ ated heart failure in the medical history .
frequent ( ≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10 ) , occasional ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 to &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) and rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 to &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) side effects , which could stand in the treatment groups with 80 mg / 120 mg of F@@ eb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at and which were reported more than once in all F@@ eb@@ lin@@ ux@@ ost@@ at treatment groups are listed below .
diarr@@ ho@@ ea , nausea and vom@@ iting are more common in patients who are treated with col@@ ch@@ ic@@ in at the same time . * * In clinical studies , severe skin rash or severe hyper@@ sensitivity reactions have been observed .
7 Open long @-@ term extension studies In the open long @-@ term extension studies , 906 patients were treated for up to 1 year , 322 patients up to 2 years , 57 patients up to 3 years and 53 patients up to 4 years with F@@ eb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at 80 mg / 120 mg .
the events related during the long @-@ term extension studies were similar to those reported in Phase 3 studies ( see Table 1 ) .
the following treatment @-@ related events were reported more than once in all cases of F@@ eb@@ lin@@ ux@@ o@@ stat@@ - treatment groups and occurred in patients who received fem@@ ux@@ ost@@ at 80 mg / 120 mg in long @-@ term extension studies ( up to 4 years with exposure time of &gt; 1,@@ 900 patient years ) , according to the indications occasionally .
the following treatment @-@ related events were either not reported at all or at a lower frequency in piv@@ otal Phase 3 piv@@ otal studies :

the efficacy of A@@ DEN@@ UR@@ IC was shown in two piv@@ otal studies of Phase 3 ( AP@@ EX study and F@@ ACT study as described below ) , which were performed with 1,@@ 8@@ 32 patients with hyper@@ ur@@ ic@@ emia and g@@ out .
the primary efficacy end@@ point was in each study the proportion of patients in which the last three monthly ser@@ um curing levels were &lt; 6,0 mg / dl ( 3@@ 57 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
plac@@ ebo ( n = 134 ) , A@@ DEN@@ UR@@ IC 80 mg 1 x daily ( n = 26@@ 9 ) , A@@ DEN@@ UR@@ IC 240 mg 1 x daily ( n = 134 ) or Allo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol 300 mg 1 x daily ( n = 10 ) for patients with a ser@@ um cancer value of &gt; 1.5 mg / dl and ≤ 2.0 mg / dl .
the AP@@ EX study showed a statisti@@ cally significant superi@@ ority in both the treatment with A@@ DEN@@ UR@@ IC 80 mg 1 x daily and with A@@ DEN@@ UR@@ IC 120 mg 1 x daily compared to the treatment with conven@@ tionally used doses Allo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol 300 mg ( n = 258 ) / 100 mg ( n = 10 ) .
the F@@ ACT study showed the statisti@@ cally significant superi@@ ority of both the treatment with A@@ DEN@@ UR@@ IC 80 mg 1 x daily and with A@@ DEN@@ UR@@ IC 120 mg 1 x daily compared to the treatment with the conventional dose Allo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol 300 mg .

the lowering of the ser@@ um resin acid level at &lt; 6,0 mg / dl ( 3@@ 57 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) was observed during the visit to the doctor in week 2 and continued throughout the entire treatment .
50@@ 9 patients received allo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol 300 mg 1 x daily ; 10 patients with ser@@ um cancer values &gt; 1.5 and &lt; 2.0 mg / dl received 100 mg 1 x daily .
primary end@@ point in the sub@@ group of patients with ren@@ al impair@@ ment The AP@@ EX trial evaluated the efficacy in 40 patients with ren@@ al impair@@ ment ( i.e. h .
with A@@ DEN@@ UR@@ IC , the primary efficacy end@@ point was 44 % ( 80 mg 1 x daily ) , 45 % ( 120 mg 1 x daily ) and 60 % ( 240 mg 1 x daily ) of the patients achieved .
there were no clin@@ ically significant differences with regard to the per@@ cent@@ al decline in ser@@ um resin concentrations in subjects , regardless of their ren@@ al function ( 58 % in the group with normal ren@@ al function and 55 % in the group with severe kidney function disorders ) .
primary end@@ point in the sub@@ group of patients with ser@@ um acid concentrations ≥ 10 mg / dl et@@ wa 40 % of patients ( AP@@ EX and F@@ ACT study ) had a ser@@ um aci@@ dity concentration ≥ 10 mg / dl at the beginning of the study ( bas@@ eline ) .
the data from the Phase 3 open extension study collected in two years showed that the permanent decrease in ser@@ um acid levels was reduced to &lt; 6 mg / dl ( &lt; 3@@ 57 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) , so that less than 3 % of patients in the months 16 @-@ 24 needed treatment for a g@@ out ( i.e. more than 97 % of patients needed no treatment against a g@@ out ) .
this was associated with a reduction in peak height , resulting in 54 % of patients resulting in a complete dis@@ appearance of the g@@ ine no@@ des by month 24 .
increased T@@ SH@@ - values ( &gt; 5.5 µ@@ IE / ml ) were observed in patients receiving a long @-@ term treatment with F@@ eb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at ( 5.0 % ) and also in patients who received Allo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol ( 5.@@ 8 % ) in the open long @-@ term extension studies ( see section 4.4 ) .
in healthy volunteers , the maximum plasma concentrations ( c@@ max ) and the area below the plasma concentration time curve ( AU@@ C ) of F@@ eb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at increased propor@@ tionally after administration of simple and multiple doses of 10 mg to 120 mg dos@@ is@@ proportional .
for doses between 120 mg and 300 mg a rise in the AU@@ C is observed for F@@ eb@@ lin@@ ux@@ at , which is greater than the dose @-@ proportional increase .
after taking simple or multiple oral doses of 80 and 120 mg 1 x daily , the c@@ max amounts to approximately 2.8 @-@ 3.2 µ@@ g / ml and 5.0 @-@ 5.3 µ@@ g / ml .
however , no clin@@ ically significant change was observed in the per@@ cent@@ ages decline in ser@@ um aci@@ dity concentration , provided that this was tested ( multiple doses of 80 mg ) .
distribution The apparent ste@@ ady state distribution volume ( V@@ pp / F ) of F@@ eb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at ranges from 29 to 75 l after doses of 10 @-@ 300 mg .
the plasma protein connection from F@@ eb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at amounts to about 9@@ 9.@@ 2 % ( primary binding to alb@@ um@@ in ) and is constant over the concentration width , which is reached with doses of 80 and 120 mg .
in vitro studies in human liver micro@@ som@@ es showed that these oxid@@ ative metabol@@ ites are mainly formed by CY@@ P@@ 1@@ A1 , CY@@ P@@ 1@@ A2 , CY@@ P2@@ C8 or CY@@ P2@@ C@@ 9 , and that f@@ eb@@ lin@@ ux@@ o@@ stat@@ e@@ glu@@ cur@@ on@@ ide is mainly caused by U@@ GT 1@@ A1 , 1@@ A8 and 1@@ A@@ 9 .
after taking an 80 mg dose of 14@@ C @-@ marked F@@ eb@@ lin@@ ux@@ ost@@ at approximately 49 % of the dose in the urine was found as unchanged F@@ eb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at ( 3 % ) , A@@ cy@@ l@@ glu@@ c@@ on@@ id of the active substance ( 30 % ) , its known oxid@@ ative metabol@@ ites and their con@@ jug@@ ates ( 13 % ) and as further unknown metabol@@ ites ( 3 % ) .
in addition to ex@@ cre@@ tion over urine , approximately 45 % of the dose in the chair found itself as unchanged F@@ eb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at ( 12 % ) , A@@ cy@@ l@@ glu@@ c@@ on@@ id of the active substance ( 1 % ) , its known oxid@@ ative metabol@@ ites and their con@@ jug@@ ates ( 25 % ) and other unknown metabol@@ ites ( 7 % ) .
specific patient populations ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency After taking multiple doses of 80 mg A@@ DEN@@ UR@@ IC in patients with mild , moderate or severe ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency , the c@@ max of F@@ eb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at did not change in relation to patients with normal ren@@ al function .
the mean total AU@@ C of F@@ eb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at increased by about 1.8 times from 7.5 μ g / ml in the group with normal ren@@ al function to 13.@@ 2 μ g / ml in the group with severe kidney function .

these findings are seen as a result of a specific Pur@@ in met@@ aboli@@ zation and urine composition and considered non @-@ relevant for clinical use .
it was found that F@@ eb@@ lin@@ ux@@ ost@@ at has no effect on fertility and reproductive capacity of male and female rats in oral doses of up to 48 mg / kg / day .

AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is used to treat o@@ steopor@@ osis ( a disease in which the bones are br@@ ittle ) in women after men@@ op@@ ause , where there is a risk of low levels of vitamin D .
the patient must take the tablet with a full glass of water ( no mineral water ) at least 30 minutes before eating , drinking or taking other medicines ( including ant@@ acids , calcium and vitamin supplements ) .
in order to avoid irrit@@ ation of the o@@ es@@ oph@@ agus , the patient must not lie down until after the first intake of the day , which should take place at least 30 minutes after taking the tablet .
as al@@ end@@ ron@@ at and vitamin D3 are already used separately in medicines approved in the European Union , the Company submitted data from previous studies and published literature .
the company also conducted a study of 35 men and 6@@ 82 post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al women with o@@ steopor@@ osis in order to demonstrate the efficacy of AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE in relation to increasing vitamin D levels .
after a 15 @-@ week treatment , the proportion of patients with low levels of vitamin D in the patients treated with AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE was lower ( 11 % ) than those who received only Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at ( 32 % ) .
the company also submitted data suggest@@ ing that the Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at dose contained in AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE corresponds exactly to the dose needed to prevent bone loss .
the most common side effects ( observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are head@@ aches , mus@@ cul@@ os@@ kel@@ etal pain ( digestive disorders ) , con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation , diarr@@ ho@@ ea ( diarr@@ hea ) , flat@@ ul@@ ence ( ul@@ cer@@ a ) , ul@@ c@@ ers , dy@@ sph@@ ag@@ ia ( swal@@ lowing ) , nas@@ al abdom@@ en ( blo@@ ated abdom@@ en ) as well as aci@@ dic sensation .
in patients with any hyper@@ sensitivity ( allergy ) to al@@ end@@ ron@@ ate , vitamin D3 or any other component AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE may not be used .
it may not be used for diseases of o@@ es@@ oph@@ agus , in patients with hypo@@ cal@@ c@@ emia ( low calcium levels ) or in patients who cannot stand or sit upright for at least 30 minutes .

AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is only available with water ( not with mineral water ) at least 30 minutes before the first meal , drink or intake of medicines ( including ant@@ acids , calcium and vitamin supplements ) for the day .
follow these instructions carefully to reduce the risk of es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al irrit@@ ation and associated side effects ( see paragraph 4.4 ) :
• AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE should only be swal@@ lowed by a full glass of water ( at least 200 ml ) after rising the day . • Pati@@ ents should not che@@ wing the tablet or leaving the tablet in the mouth as there is a risk for or@@ op@@ har@@ yn@@ ge@@ al ul@@ cer@@ a .
B. pep@@ tic ul@@ c@@ ers , active g@@ astro@@ intestinal ble@@ edings or surgical procedures in the upper Gast@@ ro@@ intestinal tract , except P@@ yl@@ or@@ oplas@@ tic , are given only with special caution ( see Section 4.3 ) .
es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al reactions , such as es@@ oph@@ ag@@ itis , es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al ul@@ cer@@ a and es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al ero@@ sions , rarely followed by es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al frac@@ tures , were reported in patients taking Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at ( partially these were severe and required hospit@@ alisation ) .
the doctor should therefore pay attention to all signs and symptoms that point to possible es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al reactions and patients should be advised to take out the medicine in case of symptoms of es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al irrit@@ ation such as dy@@ sph@@ ag@@ ia , pain during swal@@ lowing or retro@@ stern@@ al pain or new or wor@@ sen@@ ing heart@@ burn ( see paragraph 4.8 ) .
3 The risk of serious es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al side effects may be increased in patients who are not taking the medicine correctly and / or taking it after on@@ set of symptoms that point to an es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al irrit@@ ation .
it is very important that all dosage instructions are passed on to the patient and understood by the patient ( see section 4.2 ) .
whereas in large @-@ scale clinical trials with Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at there was no increased risk , rare ( after market introduction ) stomach and du@@ oden@@ al ul@@ cer@@ ations , among them some severe and with complications , were reported ( see section 4.8 ) .

there are no data available indicating whether to remove a bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate therapy in patients who require a lower surgical intervention , the risk of o@@ ste@@ on@@ dro@@ sis of the jaw dimin@@ ishes .
the clinical evaluation by the treating physician is decisive for the therapy planning of each patient based on an individual benefit @-@ risk assessment .
patients should be instructed to take the tablet in the next morning when taking a dose AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE after they have noticed their failure .
you should not take two tablets the same day , but take the intake of one tablet a week as originally planned on the intended day of the week .
other diseases affecting the metabolism ( such as vitamin D deficiency and hyp@@ op@@ ar@@ ath@@ y@@ ro@@ i@@ dis@@ m ) should also be treated adequately before starting treatment with AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE .
al@@ end@@ ron@@ at foods and beverages ( including mineral water ) , calcium supplements , ant@@ acids and some oral medicines may affect the absorption of al@@ end@@ ron when taken at the same time .
therefore , after taking al@@ end@@ ron , patients must wait at least 30 minutes before taking other medicines ( see sections 4.2 and 5.2 ) .
although specific interaction studies were not performed , Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at was taken in clinical trials along with a variety of commonly prescribed medicines without clin@@ ically relevant interactions .
AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is intended only for use in post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al women and is therefore not to be used during pregnancy or lac@@ t@@ ating women .
animal studies with al@@ end@@ ron@@ ate do not indicate directly damaging effects with regard to pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al or post@@ nat@@ al development .
o@@ ste@@ on@@ dro@@ sis of the jaw was reported in patients with bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates ; most reports stem from cancer patients , but also reported in o@@ steopor@@ osis patients .
nevertheless , ass@@ ump@@ tions of the ser@@ um calcium rose up to &lt; 8.0 mg / dl ( 2.0 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and ser@@ um phosph@@ ate up to ≤ 2.0 mg / dl ( 0.@@ 65 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) in both treatment groups with similar incidence .
al@@ end@@ ron@@ at In@@ sequence of oral over@@ dose can occur in hypo@@ cal@@ c@@ emia , hyp@@ oph@@ osph@@ at@@ a@@ emia and side effects in the upper g@@ astro@@ intestinal tract such as stomach up@@ set , heart@@ burn , o@@ es@@ oph@@ ag@@ itis , gast@@ ri@@ tis , or ul@@ cer@@ a .
Col@@ ec@@ al@@ ci@@ fer@@ ol ( vitamin D3 ) vitamin D3 is produced in the skin by UV light via the conversion of 7 @-@ Deh@@ y@@ dro@@ mes to vitamin D3 .
the main effect of vitamin D3 is the increase of the intestinal absorption of calcium and phosph@@ ate as well as the regulation of ser@@ um calcium , the ren@@ al ex@@ cre@@ tion of calcium and phosph@@ ate , bone formation and bone res@@ or@@ ption .
in severe cases , a lack of secondary hyper@@ par@@ ath@@ y@@ re@@ oi@@ di@@ smus , hyp@@ oph@@ osph@@ at@@ a@@ emia , weakness of the proxim@@ al muscles and o@@ ste@@ om@@ al@@ az@@ ie and so on can lead to an increased risk of falls and bone frac@@ tures in o@@ steopor@@ otic individuals .

the effects of al@@ end@@ ron@@ ate on bone mass and frac@@ tures in post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al women were investigated in two phase III studies of identical design ( n = 9@@ 44 ) and in the fra@@ cture @-@ intervention trial ( F@@ IT : N = 6.@@ 4@@ 59 ) .
in the phase III trials , the mean climb@@ s of the BM@@ D with Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at were 10 mg / day compared to plac@@ ebo after 3 years 8.@@ 8 % on the spine , 5.@@ 9 % on the fem@@ ur and 7.@@ 8 % at the Tro@@ chan@@ ter .

in the two @-@ year extension of these studies , the stimul@@ us of the BM@@ D of the spine and the tro@@ phy continued ; the BM@@ D of the fem@@ oral neck and the entire body was maintained .
fit consisted of two plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled studies , in which Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at was taken daily ( 5 mg daily for 2 years and then 10 mg daily , either over 1 or 2 years ) :
in this study , the daily dose of Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at reduced the appearance of at least one new verteb@@ rate fra@@ cture by 47 % ( Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at 7.@@ 9 % versus plac@@ ebo 15.@@ 0 % ) .

bio@@ availability increased correspon@@ d@@ ingly to approximately 0.@@ 46 % and 0.@@ 39 % when Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at was taken half an hour before a standar@@ dised breakfast .
in o@@ steopor@@ osis Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at was effective if it was taken at least 30 minutes before the first meal or drink of the day .
in healthy volunteers , oral pre@@ d@@ nis@@ one ( 20 mg three times daily for five days ) led to no clin@@ ically meaningful change in the oral bio@@ availability of al@@ end@@ ron ( increase in average in the range from 20 % to 44 % ) .

in the case of radio@@ activity of vitamin D3 in healthy volunteers , the average secre@@ tion of radio@@ activity in urine after 48 hours was 2.4 % , in the rot after 4 days 4.@@ 9 % .
characteristics of patients with pre@@ clinical studies have shown that the portion of al@@ end@@ ron , which is not depos@@ ited in the bone , is quickly ex@@ cre@@ ted via the urine .
although there are no clinical data about it , it is nonetheless expected that the ren@@ al elimination of al@@ end@@ ron as in animal studies will also be reduced in patients with reduced kidney function .
for this reason , patients with reduced ren@@ al function can expect slightly increased cum@@ ulation of al@@ end@@ ron@@ ate in the bone ( see section 4.2 ) .

advance is given to adult patients who have been transplan@@ ted to a kidney or liver in order to prevent a rejection of transplan@@ ted organ by the immune system .
since Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus and Progra@@ f / Progra@@ ft are already used in the EU , the company has presented the results from previous studies with Progra@@ f / Progra@@ ft as well as data from published literature .
furthermore , the results of a clinical study were submitted to 6@@ 68 patients with kidney transplan@@ tation , compared with the application of Adv@@ agra@@ ph with Progra@@ f / Progra@@ ft or C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in .
the main indicator of efficacy was the number of patients in which the transplan@@ t was rejected after one year ( by exam@@ ining how often a renewed organ transplan@@ t or res@@ um@@ ption of di@@ aly@@ sis was necessary ) .
in addition , more recently , 119 patients with kidney transplan@@ tation and 129 patients with liver transplan@@ tation were carried out and examined how Adv@@ agra@@ ph is absorbed by the body compared to Progra@@ f / Progra@@ ft .

in patients with any hyper@@ sensitivity ( allergy ) against tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , macro@@ li@@ de antibiotics ( such as er@@ y@@ thro@@ my@@ cin ) or any of the other ingredients , Adv@@ agra@@ ph may not be used .
patients and physicians must be careful if other medicines ( especially some herbal ) medicines are taken at the same time with adv@@ agra@@ m , as the adv@@ agra@@ ph dose or the dose of the medication taken at the same time must be adjusted accordingly .

only doctors who are familiar with immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy and the treatment of transplan@@ t patients should prescri@@ be this medicine or make changes in immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy .
due to clin@@ ically relevant differences in system@@ ic exposure of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , this can lead to gra@@ ft rejection or increased incidence of side effects , including under@@ - or immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression .
patients should always maintain the same tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus formulation and the corresponding daily dosage ; form@@ ulations of the formulation or the regime should only be carried out under the tight control of a doctor experienced in transplan@@ tation ( see Sec@@ tions 4.4 and 4.8 ) .
as a result of a switch to an alternative formulation , a therapeutic drug monitoring and appropriate dose adjustments must be carried out to ensure that the system@@ ic exposure of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus remains intact .
the dosage of Adv@@ agra@@ ph should be based primarily on the clinical assessment of rejection and toler@@ ability in individual cases and on blood level ( see below &quot; Recommen@@ dations
after switching from Progra@@ f to Adv@@ agra@@ f , the tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus @-@ valley levels should be controlled before the change@@ over and over two weeks after conversion .
on Day 4 , system@@ ic exposure was comparable to both kidney and liver transplan@@ ted patients with both form@@ ulations .
careful and repeated checks of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus @-@ seb@@ um levels are recommended during the first two weeks after transplan@@ tation under Adv@@ agra@@ ph to ensure proper substance exposure in the immediate post @-@ transplan@@ tation phase .
since tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus is a low clear@@ ance substance , an adjustment of the adv@@ agra@@ ph can take several days before the ste@@ ady state is reached .
if the condition of the patient in the first post @-@ operative phase does not allow oral intake of drugs , the tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus treatment can be administered intra@@ ven@@ ously ( progra@@ f 5 mg / ml concentrate to produce an in@@ fusion solution ) with a dose of ca .
duration of application To supp@@ ress the gra@@ ft rejection , immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression must be maintained ; consequently , a maximum duration of oral therapy cannot be specified .
dosage recommendations - kidney transplan@@ tation Pro@@ phyla@@ xis of gra@@ ft rejection The oral Adv@@ agra@@ ph therapy should begin with 0.@@ 20 - 0,30 mg / kg / day as a once daily dose in the morning .
further dose adjustments may later be necessary as the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus can change in the course of stabil@@ ising the patient after the transplan@@ t .
dosage recommendations - liver transplan@@ tation Pro@@ phyla@@ xis of gra@@ ft rejection The oral Adv@@ agra@@ ph therapy should begin with 0.10 - 0.@@ 20 mg / kg / day as a once daily dose in the morning .
dosage recommendation - Con@@ version from Progra@@ f to Adv@@ agra@@ ph M@@ ust be converted to a once daily intake of Progra@@ f capsules to a once daily intake of Progra@@ f capsules , so this conversion has to take place in relation 1 : 1 ( mg : mg ) , based on the total daily dose .
kidney and liver transplan@@ tation After switching from other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ si@@ va to Adv@@ ans@@ f once daily , the treatment with the oral initial dose recommended in kidney and liver transplan@@ t must begin for pro@@ phyla@@ xis of gra@@ ft rejection .
transplan@@ tation In adult patients who are converted to Adv@@ ant@@ ages , an oral initial dose of 0.@@ 15 mg / kg / day is taken daily in the morning .
other transplan@@ t recipi@@ ents , although there is no clinical experience with adv@@ agra@@ f in lung , pancre@@ atic , and intest@@ ine transplan@@ ted patients , was used in oral initial dosage of 0.@@ 10 - 0.@@ 15 mg / kg / day , for pancre@@ atic transplan@@ ted patients in an oral initial dose of 0.3 mg / kg / day .
dosage adjustments in specific patient groups patients with reduced liver function For the maintenance of cereb@@ ro@@ spinal fluid in the targeted area , a reduction of the dose may be necessary in patients with severe liver dys@@ functions .
patients with reduced kidney function Sin@@ ce ren@@ al function does not affect the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , it can be assumed that dosage adjustment is not necessary .
due to the ne@@ phr@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic potential of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , however , a careful monitoring of the ren@@ al function ( including a regular determination of the ser@@ um car@@ at@@ in@@ ine levels , a calculation of the corneal in@@ scription and a monitoring of ur@@ inary volume ) is recommended .
switch from C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in to Adv@@ agra@@ f When converting from a C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ ine to a tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus @-@ based therapy , caution is advised ( see Sec@@ tions 4.4 and 4.5 ) .
recommendations on the level in full blood The dose should primarily be based on the clinical assessment of rejection and toler@@ ability in individual cases with the help of thorou@@ gh@@ bred tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus @-@ level control .
it is recommended to perform common controls of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus plat@@ el@@ ets during the first two weeks after transplan@@ tation followed by periodi@@ c checks during maintenance therapy .
blood level of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus should also be controlled after switching from Progra@@ f to Adv@@ agra@@ ph , dosage adjustment , changes in immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ant therapy or simultaneous use of substances that could alter the tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus full blood concentration ( see Section 4.5 ) .
since Adv@@ agra@@ f is a drug with a low clear@@ ances , adap@@ tations of the dose may require several days before Ste@@ ady State has entered .
the clinical trials data suggest that successful treatment is possible in most cases when the levels in the blood do not exceed 20 n@@ g / ml .
in clinical practice , the level of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus in the whole blood is usually in the area of 5 - 20 n@@ g / ml and with kidney and heart transplan@@ ted patients at 10 - 20 n@@ g / ml .
during the subsequent maintenance therapy of liver , kidney and heart transplan@@ t recipi@@ ents blood concentrations were generally used in the range of 5 - 15 n@@ g / ml .
this has led to serious adverse events , including gra@@ ft rejection or other side effects , which can occur as a result of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus under@@ - or over@@ exposure .
patients should always maintain the same tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus formulation and the corresponding daily dosage ; form@@ ulations of the formulation or the regime should only be carried out under the tight control of a doctor experienced in transplan@@ tation ( see sections 4.2 and 4.8 ) .
5 For the treatment of adult patients with gra@@ ft rejection , which proved to be resistant to other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ants , no clinical data is available for the ret@@ arded formulation Adv@@ agra@@ ph .
to pro@@ phyla@@ xis of gra@@ ft rejection in adult heart transplan@@ t recipi@@ ents and transplan@@ t recipi@@ ents in childhood there are still no clinical data for the ret@@ arded formulation Adv@@ agra@@ f .
because of possible interactions that may lead to a lowering of the tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus levels in the blood and a weak@@ ening of the clinical effect of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , the intake of herbal supplements containing St. John &apos;s wort ( Hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) or other herbal remedies should be avoided during a treatment with Adv@@ agra@@ ph ( see Section 4.5 ) .
in patients with diarr@@ ho@@ ea , a particularly careful monitoring of the tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus concentrations in the blood is offered as the tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus blood levels can be subject to considerable fluctuations under such circumstances .
in rare cases , a cardi@@ om@@ y@@ opath@@ y referred to as car@@ dio @-@ hyper@@ tro@@ phy referred to as cardi@@ om@@ y@@ opath@@ y , which can therefore also occur under Adv@@ agra@@ ph .
other factors that increase the risk of such clinical disorders are an already existing heart disease , treatment with cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids , hyper@@ tension , kidney or liver dysfunction , infection , fluid over@@ load , and o@@ ede@@ ma .
as with other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ants , exposure to sunlight or UV light should be limited due to the potential risk of mal@@ ign@@ ant skin les@@ ions due to suitable clothing or use of a suns@@ creen with a high protection factor .
if patients taking tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus have symptoms for PRE@@ S like head@@ aches , altered states of consciousness , conv@@ ul@@ sions and bl@@ ur@@ red vision , a radi@@ ological examination ( e.@@ g .
since Adv@@ agra@@ f contain hard capsules , ret@@ arded , lac@@ tose , special caution is required in patients with rare her@@ edi@@ tary allo@@ act@@ ose int@@ oler@@ ance , lac@@ tam@@ ase deficiency or glucose @-@ gal@@ act@@ ose mal@@ absorption .
the simultaneous use of medicines or herbal remedies known as inhibit@@ ors or induc@@ tors of CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 can affect the metabolism of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus and consequently increase or lower the blood values of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus .
therefore , it is advisable to monitor the tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus blood level with the simultaneous administration of substances that can change the CY@@ P@@ 3A metabolism and adjust the tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus dose to maintain even concentrations ( see sections 4.2 and 4.4 ) .
a strongly distinctive interaction was associated with an@@ tim@@ y@@ cot@@ ic such as k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole , flu@@ con@@ az@@ ole , it@@ ra@@ con@@ az@@ ole and v@@ ori@@ con@@ az@@ ole as well as with the Macro@@ lid antibiotic er@@ y@@ thro@@ my@@ cin and HIV prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors ( z ) .
pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics studies showed that the increase in blood levels results mainly from the elevated oral bio@@ availability of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , caused by the in@@ hibition of g@@ astro@@ intestinal metabolism .
highly dos@@ ed pre@@ d@@ nis@@ ol@@ one or meth@@ yl@@ pre@@ d@@ nis@@ ol@@ one , as used in acute rejection reactions , can increase or lower the concentration of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus in the blood .
the effect of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus on the metabolism of other medicines Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus is known as CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 @-@ inhibit@@ or ; therefore , the simultaneous application of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus with medicines which are met@@ aboli@@ zed by CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 can affect their metabolism .
since Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus can reduce the clearing of ster@@ oid @-@ contra@@ cep@@ tives and thus increase hormone exposure , it is particularly careful when making decisions about contra@@ cep@@ tive measures .
the results of animal experiments have shown that tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus can potentially l@@ essen the Clear@@ ance of Pent@@ ob@@ arb@@ ital and Phen@@ az@@ on and pro@@ long their half @-@ life .
the results of a small number of transplan@@ t patients do not suggest that in comparison to other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ants , tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus is an increased risk of adverse events with regard to the course and outcome of pregnancy .
in the case of uter@@ o exposure , a monitoring of the new@@ born on potential harmful effects of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus ( especially regarding its effect on the kid@@ neys ) is recommended .
there is the risk of a premature birth ( &lt; week 37 ) and a hyper@@ cal@@ emia of the new@@ born ( incidence 8 of 111 new@@ bor@@ ns , i.e. :
the supporting profile of immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ants can often not be detected exactly because of the underlying disease of the patient and the simultaneous treatment with a variety of other medicines .
the side effects are listed below in desc@@ ending order : very common ( ≥ 1 / 100 , ≤ 1 / 10 ) , occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , ≤ 1 / 100 ) , rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 , ≤ 1 / 1,000 ) , very rare ( ≤ 1 / 10,000 , ≤ 1 / 1,000 ) , very rare ( frequency based on available data cannot be estimated ) .

cases of BK @-@ Virus associated ne@@ ph@@ rop@@ athy and J@@ C Virus associated progressive multi@@ focal leu@@ ko@@ enc@@ ephal@@ opath@@ y ( P@@ ML ) were reported in patients under immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression therapy , including therapy with Adv@@ agra@@ ph .
it was reported about ben@@ ign or mal@@ ign@@ ant ne@@ oplas@@ ms including EB@@ V@@ - associated lymp@@ ho@@ prolifer@@ ative diseases and skin tum@@ ours in combination with treatment with tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus .
due to its high molecular weight , its low water sol@@ ub@@ ility and the high binding of er@@ y@@ thro@@ cytes and plasma proteins , it can be assumed that tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus is not di@@ aly@@ iti@@ able .
the mechanism of action and pharmac@@ o@@ dynamic effects on the molecular level may be medi@@ ated by the effects of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus through its binding to a Cy@@ tos@@ ol@@ ean protein ( F@@ KB@@ P@@ 12 ) , which is responsible for the enrich@@ ment of the connection in the nucle@@ us .
this leads to a cal@@ ci@@ um@@ dependent in@@ hibition of signal trans@@ duction in the T cell , thus preventing the tran@@ scription of a certain series of lymp@@ ho@@ cytes genes .
tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus supp@@ resses the activation of T cells and the prolifer@@ ation of B cells dependent on T @-@ hel@@ per cells , further the formation of lymp@@ ho@@ cytes ( such as inter@@ leu@@ kin @-@ 2 , inter@@ leu@@ kin @-@ 3 and γ @-@ interfer@@ on ) as well as the expression of the inter@@ leu@@ kin @-@ 2 recep@@ tor .

patient @-@ transplan@@ t patients , in 4@@ 75 patients who had under@@ gone a pancre@@ atic transplan@@ tation and in 630 cases after an intestinal transplan@@ t , were used as primary immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ant .
overall , the safety profile of oral Progra@@ f was consistent with these published studies in the major studies in which Progra@@ f was used for liver , kidney and heart transplan@@ t recipi@@ ents to primary immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression .
lung transplan@@ tation In an interim analysis of a recently conducted , multic@@ enter study with oral programme was reported over 110 patients who received either tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus or c@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in in 1 : 1 random@@ ization .
chronic gra@@ ft rejection , bron@@ chi@@ oli@@ tis ob@@ liter@@ ans@@ - syndrome , was less common in the first year after transplan@@ tation ( 2.@@ 86 % versus 8,@@ 57 % ) .
survival rate after one year was 8@@ 0.8 % in the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus@@ - and 83 % in the C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in group ( Tre@@ ede et al . , 3rd IC@@ I San Diego , USA , 2004 ; Abstract 22 ) .
in the patients treated with Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , it came to 21.@@ 7 % of the cases for the development of bron@@ chi@@ oli@@ tis ob@@ liter@@ ans compared to 3@@ 8.0 % under C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( p = 0,0@@ 25 ) .
the number of cases where C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in had to be switched to tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus ( n = 13 ) was significantly greater ( p = 0.0@@ 2 ) than the number of patients en@@ acted by tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus on C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( n = 2 ) ( Ke@@ en@@ an et al . , Ann Thor@@ ac@@ ic Sur@@ g 1995 ; 60 : 580 ) .
the number of cases in which there was no acute gra@@ ft rejection was greater after 6 months ( 5@@ 7.@@ 7 % versus 45.@@ 8 % ) and after 1 year ( 50 % versus 33.@@ 3 % ) in lung transplan@@ ted patients of the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus Group ( Tre@@ ede et al . , J Heart L@@ ung Transplan@@ t 2001 ; 20 : 5@@ 11 ) .
in one study the incidence of a bron@@ chi@@ oli@@ tis ob@@ liter@@ ative syndrome in the patients treated with Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus was significantly lower .
P@@ ank@@ re@@ ast@@ ran@@ splan@@ tation A multi @-@ center study with oral Progra@@ f was conducted to 205 patients receiving a pancre@@ as and kidney transplan@@ tation , receiving a random@@ ised trial of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus ( n = 103 ) or C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( n = 102 ) .
the oral initial dose ( per protocol ) of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus was 0,2 mg / kg / day and was then reached to reach the target level of 8 to 15 n@@ g / ml on 5 .
the published clinical results of a mono@@ centric clinical study with oral Progra@@ f as the primary immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ant after intestinal transplan@@ ts showed an acute survival rate of 75 % after 1 year , 5 % after 5 years and 42 % after 10 years .
early detection methods of Ep@@ stein @-@ Bar@@ r ( EB@@ V ) - and CM@@ V infections , bone mar@@ row aug@@ mentation , additional addition of the inter@@ leu@@ kin @-@ 2 antagon@@ ist Dac@@ li@@ zumab , lower initial doses of 10 and 15 n@@ g / ml and recently transplan@@ t radiation ( Abu @-@ El@@ mag@@ d et al . , Ann Sur@@ g 2001 ; 234 : 404 ) .
factors such as low ha@@ em@@ ato@@ cri@@ t and low protein concentrations , leading to an increase in the un@@ bound group of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , or a reinforcement of metabolism caused by cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids should be responsible for the higher clear@@ ances observed after the transplan@@ t .
this suggests that tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus is almost completely met@@ aboli@@ zed before ex@@ cre@@ tion , whereby the ex@@ cre@@ tion occurs mainly via the bil@@ e .
the system@@ ic exposure of Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus ( AU@@ C@@ 0 @-@ 24 ) under Adv@@ agra@@ ph was approximately 10 % lower compared with Progra@@ f for stable patients , which were converted from Progra@@ f ( twice daily ) to the total daily dose .

advoc@@ ate is used to treat and prevent bleeding in patients with hem@@ ophi@@ lia A ( a con@@ genital blood cl@@ ot@@ ting disorder caused by the lack of factor VIII .
the dosage and frequency of the application depends on whether advoc@@ ate is used to treat bleeding or to prevent bleeding during surgical procedures .
patients with ha@@ em@@ ophi@@ lia A suffer from a factor VIII deficiency that causes blood cl@@ ots such as bleeding in joints , muscles or internal organs .
Oc@@ to@@ co@@ g al@@ fa is not extracted from human plasma but produced by a method called &quot; re@@ combin@@ ant DNA technology &quot; :
it is produced by a cell in which a gene ( DNA ) is inserted , which enables it to form the human co@@ ag@@ ulation factor VIII .
advoc@@ ate is similar to another medicine approved in the European Union named Recom@@ bin@@ ate , but is manufactured differently so that the medicine does not contain proteins or animal origin .
in three additional studies in patients with severe to moderate ha@@ em@@ ophi@@ lia A , including a study of 53 children under six years , the use of the drug was examined for the prevention of bleeding and surgical procedures .
in the main study , the efficacy of Adv@@ ent in the prevention of bleeding in 86 % of 510 new bleeding periods was &quot; excellent &quot; or &quot; good . &quot;
the most common side effects of Adv@@ ent ( observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are di@@ zz@@ iness , head@@ ache , py@@ re@@ x@@ ia ( fever ) and the formation of antibodies against factor VIII .
advoc@@ ate may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to human co@@ ag@@ ulation factor VIII , mouse or ham@@ ster protein , or any of the other ingredients .
in March 2004 , the European Commission granted the company Ba@@ x@@ ter AG an approval for the placing of Adv@@ ent in the entire European Union .
dosage and duration of sub@@ stitution treatment depend on the degree of sever@@ ity of Factor VIII deficiency , on location and extent of bleeding and clinical condition of the patient .
in the case of the following h@@ äm@@ or@@ rh@@ ag@@ ic events , factor VIII activity should not fall below the specified plasma levels ( in % of the norm , or I.@@ E. / dl ) .
repeat all 12 @-@ 24 hours ( 8 @-@ 24 hours in patients under 6 ) for 3 @-@ 4 days or more until pain and acute pain are eliminated .
repeat all 8 @-@ 24 hours ( 6 @-@ 12 hours in patients under 6 ) until the risk for the patient is over .
during treatment course , appropriate determination of factor VIII plasma levels is recommended for controlling the dose and frequency of injec@@ tions to be administered .
individual patients may differ in their reactions to factor VIII , achieve different in vi@@ vo recovery and exhibit different half @-@ value times .
3 Pro@@ phyla@@ xis for long @-@ term pro@@ phyla@@ xis of bleeding in patients with severe hem@@ ophi@@ lia A should be given doses between 20 and 40 I.@@ U. of factor VIII per kg body weight at a distance of 2 @-@ 3 days .
if the expected factor VIII plasma activity cannot be reached or if the bleeding is not controlled with a reasonable dose , a test must be performed to detect an inhibit@@ or if necessary .
in patients with high inhibit@@ ors it is possible that factor VIII therapy is not effective , so that other therapeutic measures must be considered .
the transfer rate should be based upon finding the patient , with a maximum injection rate of 10 ml / min should not be exceeded .
the formation of neutr@@ alizing antibodies ( inhibit@@ ors ) against factor VIII is a well known complic@@ ation in treating patients with hem@@ ophi@@ lia A .
these inhibit@@ ors are always against the pro@@ ko@@ ag@@ ul@@ atory activity of Ig@@ G immun@@ og@@ lob@@ ul@@ ins , which are quanti@@ fied in Beth@@ es@@ da units ( B.@@ E. ) per ml of plasma using modified Beth@@ es@@ da ass@@ ay .
the risk of developing inhibit@@ ors cor@@ relates with the extent of exposure to factor VIII , whereby the risk within the first 20 exposure days is greatest and depends on genetic and other factors .
in previously treated patients ( PT@@ Ps ) with more than 100 exposure days and an@@ am@@ n@@ estic known inhibit@@ ors development , after switching from a re@@ combin@@ ant factor VIII product to another , the re@@ occurrence of ( low@@ ly ) inhibit@@ ors was observed .
due to the rare occurrence of hem@@ ophi@@ lia A in women , there are no experiences regarding the use of factor VIII during pregnancy and lac@@ tation .
the A@@ DR@@ s that occur in the largest number of patients were inhibit@@ ors against factor VIII ( 5 patients ) , all of which were previously untreated patients with a higher risk of inhibit@@ ing the formation of inhibit@@ ors , head@@ aches ( 5 patients ) , fever and di@@ zz@@ iness ( 3 patients each ) .
very common ( ≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10 ) , occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 to &lt; 1 / 100 ) , rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 to &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) , very rarely ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 ) , not known ( frequency based on available data cannot be estimated ) .
a ) The percentage of patients was calculated using the sum of the individual patients ( 234 ) . the unexpected drop in the blood cl@@ ot@@ ting factor VIII was performed post@@ oper@@ atively in a patient under continuous A@@ DV@@ IC@@ ATE in@@ fusion ( 10 - 14 postoperative day ) .
blood cl@@ ot@@ ting was maintained throughout the period and both the factor VI@@ II@@ - Mir@@ r@@ ors in the plasma as well as the Clear@@ ance rate showed sufficient read@@ ings on the 15th post@@ oper@@ atively day .
in clinical trials with A@@ DV@@ ATE on 145 children and adults 2 with diagnosed heavy to moderate ha@@ em@@ ophi@@ lia A ( F@@ VIII ≤ 2 % ) and previous exposure to factor VI@@ II@@ - concent@@ rates ( ≥ 150 days ) only one patient showed a low inhibit@@ ory ( 2.4 B.@@ E. in the modified Beth@@ es@@ da approach ) after 26 exposure days .
in addition , at none of the 53 pa@@ edi@@ at@@ ric patients with an age of under 6 years and diagnosed heavy to moderate ha@@ em@@ ophi@@ lia A ( F@@ VIII ≤ 2 % ) after previous exposure to factor VI@@ II@@ - concent@@ rates ( ≥ 50 days ) a F@@ VIII inhibit@@ or was established .
in previously untreated patients with an ongoing clinical trial , 5 out of 25 ( 20 % ) with A@@ DV@@ ATE treated patients inhibit@@ ors against factor VIII .
the immune response of patients to traces of contaminated proteins was analysed by investigating the antibody ti@@ ters against these proteins , laboratory parameters , and reported side effects .
one patient showed a statisti@@ cally significant upward trend as well as a persistent peak of the antibody level against anti @-@ CH@@ O cell protein , otherwise there were no signs or symptoms indic@@ ative of an allergic reaction or hyper@@ sensitivity .
in four patients the incidence of ur@@ tic@@ aria , pr@@ ur@@ itus , skin rash and increased number of e@@ os@@ in@@ ophi@@ lic gran@@ u@@ loc@@ ytes was reported in several repeated product ex@@ positions within the study .
7 As in other intra@@ ven@@ ous products , A@@ DV@@ ATE reported hyper@@ sensitivity reactions of the allergic type , including an@@ aphy@@ lac@@ tic / an@@ aphy@@ lac@@ tic reactions ( frequency not known ) .
the activated Factor VIII acts as a co@@ factor for the activated Factor IX and acceler@@ ates the formation of activated Factor X by Factor X .
all pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics studies with A@@ DV@@ ATE were performed in previously treated patients with severe or moderate ha@@ em@@ ophi@@ lia A ( base value of Factor VIII activity ≤ 2 % ) .
the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic parameters come from a cross @-@ over study with A@@ DV@@ ATE in 100 previously treated patients or &gt; 10 years and are listed in table 3 below .

based on the data available since the first release , CH@@ MP continues to evaluate the benefits @-@ risk assessment as positive , but considered that the safety profile must be closely monitored for the following reasons :
therefore CH@@ MP has decided on the basis of the security profile of A@@ DV@@ ATE , which makes a fil@@ ing of PS@@ UR@@ s every 6 months , decided that the authorisation holder should apply for another renewal process within 5 years .
in December 2008 , Gen@@ du@@ x Mol@@ ec@@ ular Limited granted the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) that the company res@@ umes its application for the marketing of Adv@@ ex@@ in for the treatment of Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i cancer .
normally , however , the breast , the brain , the bones or the soft tissues ( tissues that connect , surro@@ unds and supports other structures in the body ) are affected .
this is a kind of virus that has been gene@@ tically modified in such a way that it can carry a gene into the cells of the body .
the virus in Adv@@ ex@@ in is a &quot; Aden@@ o@@ virus &quot; that has been changed in such a way that it does not produce copies of itself and thus cannot trigger infections in humans .
adv@@ an@@ in would have been inj@@ ected directly into the tum@@ ors , enabling cancer cells to re @-@ form the normal p@@ 53 protein .
the p@@ 53 protein , which is formed from the non @-@ defective p@@ 53 gene present in the human body , usually contributes to the recovery of damaged DNA and to kill the cells when the DNA cannot be recovered .
in case of Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i @-@ cancer , where the p@@ 53 gene is defective , the p@@ 53 protein does not work properly , and the cancer cells can continue to grow and share .
the company presented data from a study with a patient , with the Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i cancer in the abdominal area , bones and brain .
after the CH@@ MP checked the company &apos;s answers to the questions posed to him , some questions were still un@@ answered .
based on the review of the initial submitted documents , CH@@ MP generates a list of questions sent to the company on Day 120 .
according to the CH@@ MP opinion , it was not sufficiently demonstrated that the injection of Adv@@ ex@@ in in Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i @-@ Tum@@ ore brings advantages for the patients .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the committee also had concerns about the processing of the medicine in the body , the type of administration and the safety of the medicine . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
moreover , the company has not sufficiently demonstrated that Adv@@ ex@@ in can be manufactured in a reliable way and that it is harmful neither for the environment nor for people who come in close contact with the patient .
the company did not inform the CH@@ MP whether the withdrawal will have consequences for patients who are currently participating in clinical trials or &quot; compas@@ sion@@ ate use &quot; programmes with Adv@@ ex@@ in .
&quot; altered mode of action &quot; means that the tablets are composed so that one of the effective components is released immediately and the other slowly over a few hours .
aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze is used to treat the symptoms of seasonal allergic r@@ hin@@ itis ( ha@@ y fever caused by an allergy to pol@@ len ( nas@@ al passages ) in patients with nas@@ al mu@@ c@@ ous swelling ( c@@ logged nose ) .
in adults and adolescents from 12 years onwards , the recommended dose of aer@@ os@@ ols is twice daily a tablet , which should be taken completely with a glass of water with or without food .
the duration of the treatment should be as short as possible and termin@@ ated as soon as the symptoms , especially the swelling of the nas@@ al mu@@ cos@@ a ( c@@ logged nose ) , are ab@@ brevi@@ ated .
a treatment duration of more than 10 days is not recommended because the effects of the medicine can be reli@@ eved on the con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation of the nose .
the main effect measurements were changes in the sever@@ ity of the ha@@ y fever symptoms reported by the patients prior to the treatment and during the 15 @-@ day treatment .
during the study , patients carried out their symptoms every 12 hours in a diary and evaluated with a standard scale how severe the symptoms were in the last 12 hours .
when exam@@ ining all ha@@ y fever symptoms except the con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation of the nose , the patients who received aer@@ os@@ a@@ ze reported a decrease in the symptoms by 4@@ 6.0 % compared with 35.@@ 9 % among the patients who took pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine alone .
if only the swelling of the nas@@ al mu@@ cos@@ a was seen , the patients under aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze showed a relief of the symptoms by 37,@@ 4 % compared to 26.@@ 7 % in the patients who received the des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine alone .
the most common side effects of aer@@ os@@ a@@ ze ( observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are t@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ dia , dry mouth , di@@ zz@@ iness , psych@@ omot@@ or hyper@@ activity ( rest@@ lessness ) , con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation , head@@ ache , fatigue , in@@ som@@ nia ( sle@@ e@@ pl@@ essness ) , som@@ n@@ ol@@ ence ( som@@ n@@ ol@@ ency ) , sleep disorders and nerv@@ ousness .
aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine , pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine or any of the other components , against adren@@ ergi@@ c active substances or lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine ( other drugs used to treat allergi@@ es ) .
aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze may not be used in patients suffering from a narrow angle glaucoma ( hyper@@ tension ) , cardiac or v@@ ascular diseases , including hyper@@ tension ( hyper@@ tension ) , hyper@@ thy@@ re@@ osis ( stroke ) or a ha@@ em@@ or@@ rh@@ ag@@ ic stroke ( stroke ) or a risk of ha@@ em@@ or@@ rh@@ ag@@ ic stroke .
on 30 July 2007 , the European Commission granted the SP Europe approval to transport aer@@ os@@ ols across the European Union .
the tablet can be taken with a glass of water , but can be swal@@ lowed whole ( i.e. without breaking it , breaking or ch@@ ew ) .
aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze should not be used for children under 12 years due to the lack of data on safety and efficacy ( see paragraph 5.1 ) .
the duration of the application is as short as possible and should not be continued after the symptoms finish .
it is recommended to limit the duration of use to 10 days , as long @-@ term application can decrease the activity of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine over time .
after decrease of the swelling of the mu@@ c@@ ous membran@@ es in the upper respiratory tract , treatment can be continued as a mon@@ otherapy if required .
since aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze contains pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine , the medicine is also contra@@ indicated in patients treated with a mon@@ o@@ amin@@ oxid@@ ase ( MA@@ O ) inhibit@@ or respectively within 2 weeks of end treatment .
this is due to al@@ ph@@ am@@ im@@ etic activity in combined use of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine with other vas@@ o@@ con@@ stri@@ ctors such as bro@@ mo@@ cri@@ p@@ tin , bro@@ mo@@ cri@@ p@@ ine , cab@@ ar@@ olin , erg@@ ot@@ amine , di@@ hydro@@ erg@@ ot@@ amine or other de@@ on@@ ges@@ tive ( phen@@ yl@@ pro@@ pan@@ ol@@ amine , phen@@ y@@ le@@ phr@@ ine , eph@@ ed@@ rine , oxy@@ met@@ az@@ oline , nap@@ haz@@ olin , etc . ) .
the safety and efficacy of this combination therapy were not tested for this group of patients and the data is not sufficient to address appropriate dosage recommendations .
the safety and efficacy of aer@@ os@@ ols were not tested in patients with kidney or liver dysfunction and the data is insufficient to address appropriate dosage recommendations .
patients must be informed that treatment in case of hyper@@ tension or t@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ dia or pal@@ pit@@ ations , heart rhythm disorders , nausea or any other neurolog@@ ical symptoms ( such as head@@ aches or a strengthening of head@@ aches ) must be dismis@@ sed .
the treatment of the following patient groups is recommended : • Pati@@ ents with cardiac ar@@ rhyth@@ mia • Pati@@ ents with hyper@@ tension • Pati@@ ents with a m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction in an@@ am@@ n@@ esis , diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus , bladder neck construction or bron@@ ch@@ osp@@ as@@ m in an@@ am@@ n@@ esis .
aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze is required at least 48 hours before performing der@@ mat@@ ological tests , as anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines otherwise prevent positive reactions to indicators of skin reactions or reduce them to their extent .
in the course of clinical ex@@ ams with a lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine , in which er@@ y@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole were administered in addition , no clin@@ ically relevant interactions or changes in the plasma concentration of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine were observed .
the results of the psych@@ omot@@ or test did not show any significant differences between the patients treated with the lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine and plac@@ ebo irrespective of whether the lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine was taken alone or with alcohol .
the enzyme responsible for the metabolism of the lor@@ ad@@ ine has not yet been identified , so that interaction with other medicines can not be completely ruled out .
des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine does not inhi@@ bit CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 in vi@@ vo , and in @-@ vitro studies have shown that the drug CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 is not inhibit@@ ing and neither a substrate nor an inhibit@@ or of the P @-@ gly@@ cop@@ rot@@ eins .
the safety of the application of aer@@ os@@ ol during pregnancy is not assured , but experiences gained from a large number of affected pregn@@ an@@ cies did not increase the frequency of ab@@ norm@@ alities in comparison to the frequency of the normal population .
since reproduction studies on animals cannot always be transferred to humans and , due to the vas@@ o@@ con@@ stri@@ cting properties of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine , aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze should not be used in pregnancy .
however , patients should be informed that in very rare cases it may lead to dro@@ w@@ sin@@ ess , which may lead to an impair@@ ment of traffic ti@@ ghtness or the ability to operate machinery .
the symptoms can vary between a CN@@ S depression ( se@@ dation , ap@@ nea , decreased mental al@@ ert@@ ness , cy@@ ano@@ sis , coma , cardiovascular collapse ) and a CN@@ S stimulation ( sle@@ e@@ pl@@ essness , hall@@ u@@ cin@@ ations , tre@@ mor , conv@@ ul@@ sions ) with possible lat@@ inal processes .
head@@ aches , anxiety , difficult mic@@ tion , muscle weakness and increased muscle tension , eu@@ ph@@ oria , arous@@ al , respiratory failure , heart rhythm disorders , t@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ dia , nausea , vom@@ iting , pre@@ cor@@ di@@ ale pain , di@@ zz@@ iness , t@@ innitus , at@@ ax@@ ia , vision distur@@ ban@@ ces and hyper@@ tension or hyp@@ ot@@ onia .
a CN@@ S stimulation is particularly prob@@ able in children , as well as at@@ rop@@ ine typical symptoms ( dry mouth , pup@@ il rigi@@ dity and - di@@ lat@@ ation , red@@ dening , hyper@@ ther@@ mia and g@@ astro@@ intestinal symptoms ) .
these include both inhibit@@ ing the release of inflammatory cy@@ tok@@ ines such as IL @-@ 4 , IL @-@ 6 , IL @-@ 8 and IL @-@ 13 from human mast cells / bas@@ op@@ hil@@ es as well as the in@@ hibition of the expression of the adhesion molecules P @-@ sel@@ ec@@ tin on end@@ othel@@ ial cells .
in a single dose study with adults , the lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine showed 5 mg no influence on standard measurement parameters of the flight performance , including the ampli@@ fication of subjective dro@@ w@@ sin@@ ess or the tasks associated with flying .
in controlled clinical trials , at the recommended dosage of 5 m@@ g. a day no increased frequency of dro@@ w@@ sin@@ ess was determined compared to plac@@ ebo .
the oral application of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine in the recommended dosage can cause further sympath@@ om@@ im@@ etic effects , such as an increase in blood pressure , a t@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ dia or manifest@@ ations of CN@@ S arous@@ al .
1,@@ 248 patients aged between 12 and 78 years with seasonal allergic r@@ hin@@ itis were involved , with 4@@ 14 patients receiving aer@@ os@@ a@@ ze tablets .
in both studies the hist@@ amine antagon@@ istic activity of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablets was significantly higher than under a mon@@ otherapy with pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine over the 2 @-@ week treatment period .
the efficacy of aer@@ os@@ a@@ ze tablets with regard to the anti @-@ swelling effect , determined on the basis of the nas@@ al mu@@ cos@@ al swelling , was significantly higher than under a mon@@ otherapy with a dis@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine over the 2 @-@ week treatment period .
the efficacy of aer@@ os@@ a@@ ze tablets did not show any significant differences with regard to gender , age or eth@@ ni@@ city .
as part of a single dose study on the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze , des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine is det@@ ectable within 30 minutes after administration .
after the per@@ oral application of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze in healthy subjects over 14 days , the flow balance of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine , 3 @-@ Hydro@@ xy@@ des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine and P@@ seu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine was reached on Day 10 .
within the scope of a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic multiple dose study conducted with the formulation as a tablet in healthy adult subjects , it was found that four test persons had bad metabolism .
a component interaction study shows that exposure ( c@@ max and AU@@ C ) of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine after the sole gift of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine bio @-@ equivalent was to exposure to an aer@@ os@@ a@@ ze tablet .
based on conventional studies on safety har@@ mac@@ ology , toxic@@ ity with repeated application , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity and reproductive toxic@@ ity , however , the pre@@ clinical data with the lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine does not reveal any particular dangers to humans .
the combination had no greater toxic@@ ity than its individual components , and the observed effects were generally related to the ingredient P@@ seu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine .
in reproductive toxic@@ ological studies the combination of lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine / pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine was not ter@@ at@@ ogenic in the oral administration of rats in a dose of up to 150 mg / kg / day and in ra@@ bb@@ its at a dose of up to 120 mg / kg / day .
March 2007 and the Ph@@ armac@@ o@@ vig@@ il@@ ance system described in Module 1.@@ 8.1 of the application for authorisation is established and works before and while the product is on the market .
anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines contribute to the allevi@@ ation of the allergic symptoms by preventing hist@@ amine , a body &apos;s own substance , its effect .
aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablets allevi@@ ate symptoms associated with seasonal allergic r@@ hin@@ itis ( ha@@ y fever ) such as s@@ ne@@ e@@ zing , running or itch@@ y nose and tear@@ ing or itch@@ y eyes while con@@ sti@@ p@@ ating the nose .

tell your doctor if the following symptoms or conditions are diagnosed or diagnosed in the application of aer@@ os@@ ol : • high blood pressure • heart hunting , pal@@ pit@@ ations • heart rhythm disorders • nausea and head@@ aches or a strengthening of existing head@@ aches .
if you are taking Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze with other medicines , please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you have taken other medicines or have taken it until recently , even if it is not prescription medicine .
used in the recommended dosage , it is not to be expected that aer@@ in@@ ax leads to di@@ zz@@ iness or decreases attention .
if you have taken a larger amount of aer@@ os@@ ols than you should inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist immediately if you have taken a larger amount of aer@@ os@@ ols than you should .
if you have forgotten the use of aer@@ os@@ ol , if you forgot to take a dose in good time , take the application as soon as possible and apply the next dose at the scheduled time .
please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if any of the listed side effects may significantly affect you or notice side effects that are not indicated in this use information .
heart hunting , rest@@ lessness with increased physical activity , dry mouth , di@@ zz@@ iness , sore throat , loss of appetite , con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation , sugar in the urine , increased blood sugar levels , thirst , fatigue , head@@ aches , sleep disorders , nerv@@ ousness , and di@@ zz@@ iness .

for children between one and five years , the dose is 1.25 mg once a day , which is in the form of 2.5 ml sy@@ rup .
for children between six and eleven years , the dose is 2.5 mg once daily , either in the form of 5 ml sy@@ rup or
A@@ ER@@ I@@ US was examined in eight studies involving around 4 800 adults and adolescents with allergic r@@ hin@@ itis ( including four studies in seasonal allergic r@@ hin@@ itis and two studies in patients who also had as@@ thma ) .
the effectiveness was measured by investigating the change of symptoms ( it@@ ching , number and size of the squares , sleeping and performance of the day ) before and after six weeks of treatment .
further studies have been submitted in order to prove that the body utili@@ zes the sy@@ rup , the solution for inhal@@ ation and the melting tablets in the same way as the tablets and application in children is harmless .
in case of allergic r@@ hin@@ itis , when the results of all studies were taken together , the two @-@ week treatment with 5 mg A@@ ER@@ I@@ US resulted in an average decrease of the symptom records ( symptom score ) by 25 to 32 % , compared to the decline of 12 to 26 % among the patients receiving a plac@@ ebo .
in the two studies at Ur@@ tic@@ aria , the decrease of the symptom sever@@ ity after six weeks of treatment with A@@ ER@@ I@@ US 58 and 67 % , compared with 40 and 33 % in patients treated with plac@@ ebo .
A@@ ER@@ I@@ US may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine , lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine or any of the other ingredients .
in January 2001 , the European Commission granted the SP Europe approval for the placing of A@@ ER@@ I@@ US in the entire European Union .
one tablet once a day , with one or without a meal , to allevi@@ ate the symptoms with allergic r@@ hin@@ itis ( including inter@@ mitt@@ ent and persistent allergic r@@ hin@@ itis ) and Ur@@ tic@@ aria ( see section 5.1 ) .
there is limited experience from clinical studies to effectiveness in the application of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine in adolescents from 12 to 17 years ( see sections 4.8 and 5.1 ) .
the treatment of the inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic r@@ hin@@ itis ( symptoms for less than 4 days a week or less than 4 weeks ) should be done according to the present course of the disease and can be res@@ um@@ ed after the symptoms end and res@@ ume after re@@ appearing .
in the persistent allergic r@@ hin@@ itis ( symptoms of 4 or more days a week and more than 4 weeks ) , the patient can be recommended during the period of the allergy .
clin@@ ically relevant interactions were not found in clinical trials with dis@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine tablets , in which er@@ y@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole were administered in addition ( see section 5.1 ) .
in a clinical pharmac@@ ological study , the performance of alcohol was not increased while taking A@@ ER@@ I@@ US and alcohol ( see Section 5.1 ) .
however , patients should be informed that in very rare cases it may lead to di@@ zz@@ iness , which may lead to an impair@@ ment of traffic ti@@ ghtness or the ability to operate machinery .
clinical trials in various indications including r@@ hin@@ itis and chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria were reported at the recommended dose of 5 mg daily 3 % more side effects in patients with A@@ ER@@ I@@ US compared to those treated with plac@@ ebo .
the most frequently encountered adverse events reported more frequently than plac@@ ebo were ti@@ redness ( 1.2 % ) , mouth @-@ dro@@ ught ( 0.8 % ) and head@@ ache ( 0,6 % ) .
in a clinical study with 5@@ 78 adol@@ escent patients from 12 to 17 years , the most common side effect was head@@ aches , which occurred in 5.@@ 9 % of patients treated with dis@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine and 6.@@ 9 % of patients treated with plac@@ ebo .
clin@@ ically relevant effects were observed in a multi @-@ dose study , administered up to 45 mg of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine ( nine times clinical dose ) .
this includes blocking the release of inflammatory cy@@ tok@@ ines such as IL @-@ 4 , IL @-@ 6 , IL @-@ 8 and IL @-@ 13 from human mast cells / bas@@ op@@ hil@@ es as well as the in@@ hibition of the adhesion of the adhesion molecules P @-@ sel@@ ec@@ tin to end@@ othel@@ ial cells .
there was no statisti@@ cally significant or clin@@ ically relevant cardiovascular effect as part of a clinical study involving multiple doses of up to 20 m@@ g. a day in a dose of up to 20 m@@ g. a day .
in a clinical pharmac@@ ological study , in which the lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine was administered at a dose of 45 mg daily ( the nine times the clinical dose ) over ten days , there was no pro@@ long@@ ation of the Q@@ t@@ c interval .
in a single dose study with adults , the lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine showed no influence on standard measurement parameters of the flight performance , including the ampli@@ fication of subjective dro@@ w@@ sin@@ ess or the tasks associated with flying .
in patients with allergic r@@ hin@@ itis , A@@ ER@@ I@@ US was effective in reli@@ eving symptoms such as s@@ ne@@ e@@ zing , nas@@ al secre@@ tion and it@@ ching of the nose , it@@ ching , lac@@ ri@@ mal drainage and redness of the eyes as well as it@@ ching on the palate .
in addition to the established classification in seasonal and per@@ enni@@ al , allergic r@@ hin@@ itis can alternatively be divided into inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic r@@ hin@@ itis and persistent allergic r@@ hin@@ itis .
inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic r@@ hin@@ itis is defined as the occurrence of symptoms for less than 4 days a week or less than 4 weeks .
persistent allergic r@@ hin@@ itis is defined as the on@@ set of symptoms on 4 or more days a week and more than 4 weeks .
as demonstrated by the overall score of the questionn@@ aire on the quality of life of Rhin@@ o @-@ con@@ jun@@ c@@ tivi@@ tis , A@@ ER@@ I@@ US effectively reduces the strain caused by seasonal r@@ hin@@ itis .
the chron@@ ically idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria was investigated as a substitute for further forms of ur@@ tic@@ aria , since the underlying path@@ ophysi@@ ology is similar to the different forms and chronic patients can be recru@@ ited more easily pro@@ spec@@ tively .
because hist@@ am@@ ines are a caus@@ ative factor in all ur@@ tic@@ ari@@ al diseases , it is expected that in addition to chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , the disease also leads to an improvement in the symptoms in other forms of ur@@ tic@@ aria ; this is confirmed by the recommendations of the clinical guidelines .
in two plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled trials over 6 weeks in patients with chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , A@@ ER@@ I@@ US was effective in improving pr@@ ur@@ itus and the reduction of size and number of squares at the end of the first dose interval .
as in other studies with anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines in chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , the majority of patients who did not react to anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines were excluded from the study .
improvement of the it@@ ching stimul@@ us by more than 50 % was observed in 55 % of patients treated with des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine compared to 19 % of patients treated with plac@@ ebo .
the treatment with A@@ ER@@ I@@ US significantly reduced the distur@@ b@@ ance of sleep and vig@@ or , as measured by a 4 @-@ point scale for evaluating these variables .
in a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics study in which the patient demo@@ s were comparable to the general seasonal allergic r@@ hin@@ itis population , 4 % of patients have reached a higher concentration of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine .
there are no indications for clin@@ ically relevant cum@@ ulative accumulation after a daily use of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine ( 5@@ - 20 mg ) for 14 days .
however , the enzyme responsible for the metabolism of the lor@@ ad@@ ine has not yet been identified , so that interaction with other medicines will not be completely eliminated
in @-@ vi@@ vo not CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 and in @-@ vitro studies have shown that the drug CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 does not inhi@@ bit and neither a substrate nor an inhibit@@ or of the P @-@ gly@@ cop@@ rot@@ eins is .
in a single dose study with a lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine in a dose of 7.5 mg , meals ( fatty , cal@@ orie @-@ rich breakfast ) did not affect the availability of the lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine .
the pre@@ clinical studies carried out with the lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine and lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine showed no qualitative or quantitative differences with regard to the toxic@@ ity profile of the lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine and lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine .
based on conventional studies on safety har@@ mac@@ ology , toxic@@ ity with repeated application , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity and reproductive toxic@@ ity , the pre@@ clinical data with the lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine cannot identify any particular dangers to humans .

A@@ ER@@ I@@ US can be taken independently of meals to rel@@ ieve the symptoms of allergic r@@ hin@@ itis ( including inter@@ mitt@@ ent and persistent allergic r@@ hin@@ itis ) and Ur@@ tic@@ aria ( see section 5.1 ) .
the prescri@@ ber doctor should be aware that most cases of r@@ hin@@ itis in children under 2 years of infection are caused by an infection ( see under Section 4.4 ) and that there are no data available to support a treatment of an infectious Rhin@@ itis with A@@ ER@@ I@@ US .
in addition to the exclusion of upper respiratory tract infections or anatom@@ ical an@@ om@@ ali@@ es , an@@ am@@ n@@ esis , physical examinations and corresponding laboratory and skin examinations should play a role in the diagnosis .
approximately 6 % of adults and children between 2 and 11 years are metabol@@ ising the lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine and experience higher substance levels ( see Section 5.2 ) .
the safety of A@@ ER@@ I@@ US sy@@ rup in children between 2 and 11 years that are fully met@@ aboli@@ zing is identical to that in children who are normally met@@ aboli@@ zing .
this drug contains su@@ cro@@ se and sor@@ bit@@ ol ; therefore , patients with her@@ edi@@ tary problems of fru@@ ct@@ ose int@@ oler@@ ance , glucose @-@ gal@@ act@@ ose absorption inhibit@@ or or sac@@ char@@ ase is@@ om@@ alt@@ ase deficiency should not take this medicine .
clin@@ ically relevant interactions were not found in clinical studies with A@@ ER@@ I@@ US tablets , in which er@@ y@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ol were administered in addition ( see section 5.1 ) .
in a clinical pharmac@@ ological study , the performance of alcohol was not increased while taking A@@ ER@@ I@@ US tablets and alcohol ( see Section 5.1 ) .
the overall frequency of adverse events in children between 2 and 11 years was similar to the A@@ ER@@ I@@ US sy@@ rup group similar to the plac@@ ebo group .
clinical studies with adults and adolescents in various indications including r@@ hin@@ itis and chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria were reported at the recommended dose of 3 % more side effects in patients with A@@ ER@@ I@@ US compared to those treated with plac@@ ebo .
clin@@ ically relevant effects were observed in a multi @-@ dose study of adults and adolescents , in which up to 45 mg of des@@ ic ad@@ ine ( nine times clinical dose ) were administered .
children between the ages of 1 and 11 who were eligible for an anti@@ hist@@ amine therapy received a daily dietary supplement of 1.25 mg ( aged between 1 and 5 years ) or 2.5 mg ( aged between 6 and 11 years ) .
because the course of allergic r@@ hin@@ itis / chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria and the profile of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine in adults and children are similar , the efficacy data of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine in adults can be extra@@ pol@@ ated to the children &apos;s population .
in a clinical study involving multiple doses of adults and adolescents , in which the lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine was used in a dose of up to 20 m@@ g. a day over 14 days , no statisti@@ cally significant or clin@@ ically relevant cardiovascular effect was described .
in a clinical @-@ pharmac@@ ological study of adults and adolescents , in the des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine in a dose of 45 mg daily ( the nine times the clinical dose ) was applied for ten days in adults , there was no pro@@ long@@ ation of the Q@@ t@@ c interval .
in controlled clinical trials , at the recommended dosage of 5 mg daily for adults and adolescents , no increased frequency of sleep@@ iness compared to plac@@ ebo was determined .
in a single daily dose of 7.5 mg A@@ ER@@ I@@ US tablets led to any impair@@ ment of psych@@ omot@@ or in clinical trials .
in clinical pharmac@@ ological studies in adults , the simultaneous consumption of alcohol has neither resulted in a strengthening of alcohol induced power impair@@ ment nor an increase in dro@@ w@@ sin@@ ess .
in adults and adolescents with allergic r@@ hin@@ itis , A@@ ER@@ I@@ US tablets were effective in reli@@ eving symptoms such as s@@ ne@@ e@@ zing , nas@@ al secre@@ tion and it@@ ching of the nose , it@@ ching , lac@@ ri@@ mal drainage and redness of the eyes as well as it@@ ching on the palate .
as demonstrated by the total scores of the quality of life of Rhin@@ o @-@ con@@ jun@@ c@@ tivi@@ tis , A@@ ER@@ I@@ US tablets effectively reduce the caused by seasonal r@@ hin@@ itis
in two plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled trials over 6 weeks in patients with chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , A@@ ER@@ I@@ US was effective in improving pr@@ ur@@ itus and the reduction of size and number of squares at the end of the first dose interval .
the spread of this limited @-@ met@@ aboli@@ zing phen@@ otype was similar to adults ( 6 % ) and children between 2 and 11 years ( 6 % ) and in both populations larger in black ( 18 % adults , 16 % children ) than with Cau@@ ca@@ si@@ ans ( 2 % adults , 3 % children ) .
similar pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic parameters were observed in a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic multi @-@ dose study with sy@@ rup formation in children between 2 and 11 years with allergic r@@ hin@@ itis .
the load ( AU@@ C ) by Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine was about 6 times higher after 3 to 6 hours and the c@@ max about 3 to 4 times higher with a terminal half @-@ time of approximately 120 hours .
there are no indications for clin@@ ically relevant substance accumulation after a daily use of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine ( 5@@ - 20 mg ) over 14 days in adults and adolescents .
12 In different single dose studies , the study showed that both AU@@ C and c@@ max values were comparable with pedi@@ at@@ ric patients at the recommended doses with those of adults who received the dis@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine sy@@ rup in a dose of 5 mg .
however , the enzyme responsible for the metabolism of the lor@@ ad@@ ine has not yet been identified , so that interaction with other medicines can not be completely ruled out .
A@@ ER@@ I@@ US sy@@ rup is available in type III bra@@ ided glass bottles with a child safe polypropylene closing cap with 30 , 50 , 60 , 100 , 120 , 150 , 225 and 300 ml .
equipped with a rigid , transparent pol@@ yst@@ yrene measuring spoon , calibr@@ ated with 2.5 ml and 5 ml or with an application sy@@ ringe for preparation with sc@@ aling of 2.5 ml and 5 ml ( for the 150 ml bottle only ) .

immediately before application , the bli@@ ster must be carefully opened and the dose of the ly@@ op@@ hil@@ is@@ ats can be removed without damaging it .
clin@@ ically relevant interactions were not found in clinical studies with A@@ ER@@ I@@ US tablets , in which er@@ y@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ol were additionally applied ( see section 5.1 ) .
in clinical trials in various indications , including allergic r@@ hin@@ itis and chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , 3 % more side effects were reported in patients with A@@ ER@@ I@@ US tablets at the recommended dose of 5 mg daily compared to those treated with plac@@ ebo .
clin@@ ically relevant effects were observed in a multi @-@ dose study , in which up to 45 mg of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine ( nine times clinical dose ) were applied .
A@@ ER@@ I@@ US Ly@@ op@@ hil@@ is@@ at was well toler@@ ated in two single dose studies ; this was documented by clinical laboratory results , medical examinations , vital signs and EC@@ G interval data .
as part of a clinical study with multiple doses in which the lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine was used in a dose of up to 20 m@@ g. a day over 14 days , no statisti@@ cally significant or clin@@ ically relevant cardiovascular effect was described .
in a clinical pharmac@@ ological study , in which the lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine was used in a dose of 45 mg daily ( the nine times the clinical dose ) over ten days , there was no pro@@ long@@ ation of the Q@@ t@@ c interval .
in controlled clinical trials , at the recommended dosage of 5 m@@ g. a day no increased frequency of dro@@ w@@ sin@@ ess was determined compared to plac@@ ebo .
in a 17 single dose study with adults , the lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine showed 5 mg no influence on standard measurement parameters of the flight performance , including the ampli@@ fication of subjective dro@@ w@@ sin@@ ess or the tasks associated with flying .
in patients with allergic r@@ hin@@ itis , A@@ ER@@ I@@ US tablets were effective in reli@@ eving symptoms such as s@@ ne@@ e@@ zing , nas@@ al secre@@ tion and it@@ ching of the nose , it@@ ching , lac@@ ri@@ mal drainage and redness of the eyes as well as it@@ ching on the palate .

two A@@ ER@@ I@@ US 2.5 mg melt tablets once daily put in the mouth to allevi@@ ate the symptoms with allergic r@@ hin@@ itis ( including inter@@ mitt@@ ent and persistent allergic r@@ hin@@ itis ) and Ur@@ tic@@ aria ( see section 5.1 ) .
there is limited experience from clinical studies to effectiveness in the application of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine in adolescents from 12 to 17 years ( see sections 4.8 and 5.1 ) .
immediately before application , the bli@@ ster must be carefully opened and the dose of the melt tablet can be removed without damaging it .
the efficacy and safety of A@@ ER@@ I@@ US 2.5 mg melt tablets in the treatment of children under 6 years have not been proven until now .
the overall frequency of the side effects between the dis@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine sy@@ rup and the plac@@ ebo group was the same and did not differ significantly from the safety profile detected in adult patients .
at the recommended dose , A@@ ER@@ I@@ US melting tablet proved to be a bio@@ equivalent to the A@@ ER@@ I@@ US 5 mg conventional tablet formulation and the A@@ ER@@ I@@ US 5 mg Ly@@ op@@ hil@@ is@@ at for engaging in the distill@@ ate .

the spread of this poor@@ ly met@@ aboli@@ zing phen@@ otype was similar to adults ( 6 % ) and pedi@@ at@@ ric patients between 2 and 11 years ( 6 % ) , and among bl@@ acks ( adults 18 % , children 16 % ) larger than in Cau@@ ca@@ si@@ ans ( adults 2 % , children 3 % ) , the safety profile of these patients was not different from that of the general population .
in single @-@ dose crossover studies of A@@ ER@@ I@@ US Mel@@ ting tablet with A@@ ER@@ I@@ US 5 mg conventional tablets or A@@ ER@@ I@@ US 5 mg Ly@@ op@@ hil@@ is@@ at , the form@@ ulations were bio@@ equivalent .
A@@ ER@@ I@@ US 2.5 mg tablets were not studied in pa@@ edi@@ at@@ ric patients , but in combination with the dose @-@ finding studies in children , however , the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic data for A@@ ER@@ I@@ US melting tablets support the use of 2.5 mg dosage in children from 6 to 11 years .

the safety of the lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine in children between 2 and 11 years that are fully met@@ aboli@@ zing is identical to that of children who are normally met@@ aboli@@ zing .
this drug contains sor@@ bit@@ ol ; therefore , patients with her@@ edi@@ tary problems of fru@@ ct@@ ose int@@ oler@@ ance , glucose @-@ gal@@ act@@ ose absorption inhibit@@ or or sac@@ char@@ ase is@@ om@@ alt@@ ase deficiency should not use this medicine .
the overall frequency of adverse events in children between 2 and 11 years was similar to the plac@@ ebo group in the Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine group .
inf@@ ants between 6 and 23 months were the most frequently encountered adverse events reported more frequently than plac@@ ebo , diarr@@ ho@@ ea ( 3.7 % ) , fever ( 2,3 % ) and sle@@ e@@ pl@@ essness ( 2,3 % ) .
in an additional study , at a one @-@ time dose of 2.5 mg of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine , no side effects were observed in patients aged between 6 and 11 years .
in the recommended doses the plasma concentrations of the des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine ( see section 5.2 ) were comparable in the children &apos;s and adult population .
in controlled clinical trials , at the recommended dosage of 5 mg daily for adults and adolescents , no increased frequency of sleep@@ iness compared to plac@@ ebo was determined .
in addition to established classification in seasonal and per@@ enni@@ al , allergic r@@ hin@@ itis can alternatively also be in inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic r@@ hin@@ itis .
as shown by the overall score of the questionn@@ aire on the quality of life of Rhin@@ o @-@ con@@ jun@@ c@@ tivi@@ tis , A@@ ER@@ I@@ US tablets effectively reduce the strain caused by seasonal r@@ hin@@ itis .
the spread of this limited @-@ met@@ aboli@@ zing phen@@ otype was similar to adults ( 6 % ) and children between 2 and 11 years ( 6 % ) and in both populations larger in black ( 18 % adults , 16 % children ) than with Cau@@ ca@@ si@@ ans ( 2 % adults , 3 % children ) .
since A@@ ER@@ I@@ US contains the same concentration of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine , no bio @-@ equivalent study was required and it is expected that it corresponds to the sy@@ rup and the tablets .
in different single dose studies , both the C- and c@@ max values of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine in pedi@@ at@@ ric patients at the recommended doses were comparable to those of adults who received dis@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine sy@@ rup in a dose of 5 mg .

in June 2008 , Nov@@ arti@@ s V@@ acc@@ ines and Diagnostics S.@@ r.@@ l. granted the approval of the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) that the company res@@ umes its application for the launch of A@@ fl@@ un@@ ov on the prevention of the avi@@ ary H@@ 5@@ N@@ 1 influ@@ enza in adults and elderly people .
A@@ fl@@ un@@ ov should be used in adults and elderly people to protect against flu caused by the strain ( type ) H@@ 5@@ N@@ 1 of the influ@@ enza A virus .
this is a special type of vaccine to protect from a strain of the flu virus that could cause future pan@@ de@@ mic .
a flu pan@@ de@@ mic breaks out when a new strain of the flu virus appears , which can spread easily from man to person , because people have no immun@@ ity ( no protection ) on the other hand .
after administration of the vaccine , the immune system recognis@@ es the parts of the influ@@ enza virus present in the vaccine as &quot; body foreign &quot; and forms antibodies against it .
as a result , the immune system is able to make antibodies faster in contact with a flu virus in this family .
subsequently , the membrane cover of the virus with the &quot; surface anti@@ gens &quot; ( proteins on the membrane surface that recognizes the human body as a foreign body ) has been puri@@ fied , puri@@ fied and used as part of the vaccine .
an inspection of some of the study sites showed that the study was not carried out according to &quot; good clinical practice &quot; ( G@@ CP ) .
as a result , the scope of the clinical data base for the assessment of the safety of the vaccine was not sufficient to meet the requirements of the E@@ MEA guidelines for pre@@ pan@@ de@@ mic vacc@@ ines .
should you participate in a clinical trial and require further information about your treatment , please contact your doctor in charge .
if you would like further information on the basis of the CH@@ MP recommendations , please read the scientific discussion ( also part of the EP@@ AR ) .
it is used in combination with other anti@@ viral medicines to treat adults and children over four years , which are infected with the human immun@@ o@@ deficiency virus type 1 ( HIV @-@ 1 ) , which causes the acquired immun@@ o@@ deficiency syndrome ( AIDS ) .
for patients who cannot swal@@ low the capsules , A@@ gener@@ ase is available as a solution to intake but it cannot be taken together with R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r because the safety of this combination has not been studied .
A@@ gener@@ ase should only be prescribed if the doctor has examined what anti@@ viral medicines the patient has taken before , and the lik@@ eli@@ hood has been made that the virus will respond to the medicine .
the recommended dose for patients over twelve years amounts to 600 mg twice daily , which are taken together with twice daily 100 mg of rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r and with other anti@@ viral medicines .
in children between four and twelve years and in patients with a body weight of less than 50 kg , the recommended dose of as@@ thma is based on body weight .
in combination with other anti@@ viral medicines , A@@ gener@@ ase reduces the amount of HIV in the blood and keeps it at a low level .
not to cure AIDS , however , can delay the damage of the immune system and thus also the development of AIDS @-@ related infections and diseases .
A@@ gener@@ ase was studied in combination with other anti@@ viral drugs , but without R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r , in two main studies with 7@@ 36 HIV @-@ infected adults who had previously not been treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors .
the drug A@@ gener@@ ase increased with low dos@@ ed R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r was compared to other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors in 206 adults who had previously taken prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors .
the main indicator for efficacy was the proportion of patients with non @-@ det@@ ectable levels of HIV in the blood ( viral load ) or the change in the viral load after treatment .
in the studies with patients who had not previously had a prot@@ ease inhibit@@ or , after 48 weeks in general , more patients had a viral load of 400 copies / ml compared to plac@@ ebo , but A@@ gener@@ ase was less effective than in@@ din@@ avi@@ r .
in children , A@@ gener@@ ase also reduced the viral load , but with the children who had previously been treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , only very few responded to the treatment .
in the study with adults who had previously been treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , the medicine called R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r increased the viral load after 16 weeks of treatment as effective as other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors :
in the patients with HIV , which was resistant to four other prot@@ e@@ as@@ hi@@ mi@@ ds , it came under A@@ gener@@ ase together with R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r to a stronger drop in the viral load after four weeks compared to the patients who continued to take up their former prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors :
the most common side effects of A@@ gener@@ ase ( observed in more than 1 out of 10 patients ) are head@@ aches , diarr@@ ho@@ ea ( diarr@@ hea ) , flat@@ ul@@ ence ( flat@@ ul@@ ence ) , nausea , vom@@ iting , rash and fatigue ( fatigue ) .
2 / 3 A@@ gener@@ ase may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r or any of the other ingredients .
A@@ gener@@ ase may not be used in patients , the St. John &apos;s wort ( an herbal supplement for the treatment of depression ) or medicines , which are de@@ composed just like as@@ thma and are harmful to health in high concentrations in the blood .
as with other medicines for HIV , there is a risk of li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy ( changes in the distribution of fat ) , o@@ ste@@ on@@ ec@@ ro@@ sis ( death of bone tissue ) or immune activation syndrome ( symptoms of infection caused by the re@@ covering immune system ) .
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that the benefits of A@@ gener@@ ase when used in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs for the treatment of HIV @-@ 1 infected adults and children over four years compared to the risks .
A@@ gener@@ ase is usually taken together with the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic ampli@@ fiers R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r , but the committee determined that the benefit of as@@ re@@ ase in combination with R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r in patients who previously had not taken prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors was not proven .
A@@ gener@@ ase was originally licensed under &quot; exceptional circumstances , &quot; since only limited information was available for scientific reasons .
in October 2000 , the European Commission granted Gla@@ x@@ o Group Limited permission to transport A@@ gener@@ ase to the European Union .
A@@ gener@@ ase is shown in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs for the treatment of HIV @-@ 1 infected , prot@@ e@@ ase inhibit@@ ors ( PI ) pre@@ treated adults and children from 4 years onwards .
usually , A@@ gener@@ ase capsules are to be given to the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic booster by Am@@ rit@@ avi@@ r along with low doses of R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( see sections 4.2 and 4.5 ) .
the use of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r should be done taking into account the individual viral resistance pattern and the pre@@ treatment of the patient ( see Section 5.1 ) .
the bio@@ availability of Am@@ rit@@ avi@@ r as a solution to intake is by 14 % lower than from Am@@ rit@@ avi@@ r as capsule ; therefore , A@@ gener@@ ase capsules and solution are not inter@@ changeable for taking on a milli@@ gram per milli@@ gram basis ( see Section 5.2 ) .
the recommended dose for A@@ gener@@ ase capsules is 600 mg of Am@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily along with 100 mg of rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs .
2 If A@@ gener@@ ase capsules are applied without the additional addition of R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( boost ) , higher doses of as@@ re@@ ase ( 1200 mg twice daily ) must be applied .
the recommended dose for A@@ gener@@ ase capsules is 20 mg of Am@@ rit@@ avi@@ r / kg body weight twice daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs up to a daily maximum dosage of 2400 mg of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r that should not be exceeded ( see Section 5.1 ) .
the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics , efficacy and safety of A@@ gener@@ ase in combination with low doses of R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r or other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors were not studied in children .
A@@ gener@@ ase is not recommended for use in children under 4 years of age due to the lack of data on safety and efficacy ( see Section 5.2 ) .
based on the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic data , the dose of A@@ gener@@ ase capsules in adult patients with moderate liver dysfunction should be reduced to 450 mg twice daily and in patients with severe liver dysfunction to 300 mg twice daily .
the simultaneous application should be carried out with caution in patients with mild or moderate liver dysfunction . in patients with severe liver dysfunction , it is contra@@ indicated ( see Section 4.3 ) .
A@@ gener@@ ase may not be given at the same time with drugs that have a low therapeutic width and also present sub@@ strates of the cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 is@@ o@@ enzy@@ ms 3@@ A4 ( CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 ) .
plant preparations containing St. John &apos;s wort ( Hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) may not be used for the risk of reduced plasma concentrations and a dimin@@ ished therapeutic effect of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r while taking am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( see Section 4.5 ) .
patients should be advised that as@@ thma or any other anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy does not lead to curing the HIV infection and that they continue to develop opportun@@ istic infections or other complications of HIV infection .
current anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy including treatment with A@@ gener@@ ase does not prevent the risk of transmitt@@ ing HIV to others through sexual contact or contamination with blood .
usually , as@@ cap@@ ase capsules should be used along with low doses of rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r and in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs ( see section 4.2 ) .
patients suffering from chronic hepatitis B or C and treated with anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy have an increased risk of severe liver interaction with potentially fatal course .
in case of simultaneous anti@@ viral treatment of hepatitis B or C , please read the relevant information of this medicine .
patients with pre @-@ existing reduced liver function including chronic @-@ active hepatitis show an increased incidence of liver dysfunction under an anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy and should be monitored according to clinical practice .
the simultaneous use of A@@ gener@@ ase and R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r with flu@@ tic@@ as@@ one or other glu@@ co@@ cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ides , which are metabol@@ ised via CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , is not recommended unless the possible benefit of a treatment out@@ weighs the risk of system@@ ic cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oi@@ des including the Cus@@ hing and Supp@@ ression of the adren@@ al function ( see Section 4.5 ) .
since the metabolism of the H@@ MG Co@@ A reduc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ or is strongly dependent on CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , an simultaneous administration of A@@ gener@@ ase with lov@@ ast@@ atin and sim@@ v@@ ast@@ atin is not recommended because of the increased risk of my@@ opath@@ ies including R@@ hab@@ dom@@ y@@ oly@@ sis .
4 For some medicines that can cause serious or life @-@ threatening side effects such as carb@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine , phen@@ ob@@ arb@@ ital , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ de@@ press@@ ants , and war@@ far@@ in ( under supervision of the International Norm@@ alised R@@ atio ) , methods for determining the drug concentration are available .
in patients taking these medicines at the same time , A@@ gener@@ ase can be less effective because of reduced plasma levels of amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r ( see Section 4.5 ) .
because of the possibility of metabolic interaction with the am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , the efficacy of hormon@@ al contra@@ cep@@ tives can be altered , however , the information is not sufficient to assess the type of interactions .
if meth@@ ad@@ one is also given with amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r at the same time , the patients should therefore be monitored on os@@ pi@@ ate withdrawal symptoms , especially if low doses of R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r are administered .
because of the possible risk of toxic@@ ity due to the high propylene gly@@ col content of the A@@ gener@@ ase solution , this formulation is contra@@ indicated in children under an age of four years and should be used with care in certain other patient groups .
A@@ gener@@ ase should be canc@@ eled in the duration of 5 if a rash is accompanied by system@@ ic or allergic symptoms or the mu@@ c@@ ous membran@@ es are involved ( see paragraph 4.8 ) .
in patients receiving anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy including prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , the incidence of diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus , hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia , or exac@@ erb@@ ation of an existing diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus has been reported .
many of the patients had other conditions for which medication was necessary to be associated with the development of diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus or hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia .
B. higher age , and associated with drug related factors , such as prolonged anti@@ retro@@ viral treatment and associated metabolic disorders .
in hem@@ ophi@@ lic patients ( type A and B ) treated with prot@@ e@@ ase inhibit@@ ors , there are reports of an increase in bleeding , including spontaneous cut@@ aneous hem@@ at@@ omas and ha@@ em@@ o@@ arthritis .
in HIV @-@ infected patients with severe immune defect , an inflammatory response to asy@@ mpt@@ om@@ atic or residual opportun@@ istic infections can develop at the time of initi@@ ation of an anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy ( ART ) leading to severe clinical conditions or wor@@ sen@@ ing of symptoms .
although a multi@@ fac@@ torial aesthetic is accepted ( including application of cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids , alcohol consumption , severe immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression , higher body mass index ) , cases of o@@ ste@@ on@@ ec@@ tom@@ y were reported in particular in patients with advanced HIV infection and / or long @-@ term application of anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy ( ART ) .
CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 sub@@ strates with low therapeutic width A@@ gener@@ ase may not be given at the same time with medicines that have a low therapeutic width and also present sub@@ strates of the cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 is@@ o@@ enzy@@ ms 3@@ A4 ( CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 ) .
CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 sub@@ strates with low therapeutic width A@@ gener@@ ase with R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r may not be combined with drugs whose active substances are primarily metabol@@ ised via CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 and are linked to increased plasma levels with serious and / or life @-@ threatening side effects .
it has been shown that Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in causes 82 % reduction in the AU@@ C of Am@@ rit@@ avi@@ r , which can lead to vi@@ rolog@@ ical failure and resistance development .
in the attempt to balance the lowest plasma levels by dose increase of other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors in combination with R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r , adverse effects on the liver were often observed .
St. John &apos;s Wort ( Hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) The ser@@ um mirrors of Am@@ rit@@ avi@@ r can be reduced by the simultaneous use of plant preparations with St. John &apos;s wort ( Hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) .
if a patient already takes St. John &apos;s wort , the ammon@@ ia levels are and , if possible , to check the viral load and remove the St. John &apos;s wort .
dosage adjustment for one of the medicines is not necessary if Nel@@ fin@@ avi@@ r is given together with Am@@ rit@@ avi@@ r ( see also E@@ f@@ avi@@ ren@@ z below ) .
508 % increased , for c@@ max however , reduced by 30 % when R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) was given in combination with amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r capsules ( 600 mg twice daily ) .
in clinical trials , doses of 600 mg of Am@@ rit@@ avi@@ r were applied twice daily and rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg twice a day demonstrating the efficacy and safety of this treatment regim@@ en .
52 % low when Am@@ rit@@ avi@@ r ( 750 mg twice daily ) was administered in combination with Kal@@ et@@ ra ( 400 mg Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r + 100 mg R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily ) .
the C@@ min values of the plasma , which were achieved twice a day in the combination of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) with Kal@@ et@@ ra ( 400 mg of Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r + 100 mg of R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily ) , are approximately 40 to 50 % lower than when Am@@ rit@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) is administered twice daily in combination with 100 mg of R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
dosage recommendation for the simultaneous administration of Am@@ rit@@ avi@@ r and Kal@@ et@@ ra cannot be given , but a close monitoring is recommended , as the efficacy and safety of this combination is not known .
no pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic study was carried out in combination with di@@ dan@@ os@@ in in combination with di@@ dan@@ os@@ in , but due to the anta@@ sia component of Di@@ dan@@ os@@ in it is recommended that the proceeds of di@@ dan@@ os@@ in and a@@ gener@@ ase are at least one hour apart ( see App@@ ta@@ zi@@ da below ) .
therefore , in combination with amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) and rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) no dosage adjustment is necessary .
treatment with avi@@ ren@@ z in combination with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r is not recommended as exposure of both prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors would decrease .
the effects of Ne@@ vi@@ ra@@ pine to other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors and existing limited data suggest that Ne@@ vi@@ ra@@ pine may lower the ser@@ um concentration of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r .
if these drugs should be used at the same time , caution is advised as del@@ avi@@ r@@ ins could be less effective because of the reduced or possibly sub@@ therapeutic plasma levels .
if these drugs are used together , caution is advised ; thorough clinical and vi@@ rolog@@ ical monitoring should be carried out as an accurate pre@@ diction of the effect of the combination of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r is difficult on del@@ avi@@ r@@ din .
the simultaneous administration of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin resulted in a rise in plasma concentration ( AU@@ C ) of ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin by 193 % , resulting in an increase in side effects associated with ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin .
if it is necessary for clinical reasons to administ@@ er the ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin together with A@@ gener@@ ase , a reduction in the dosage of ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin is recommended to at least half of the recommended dose , although there are no clinical data available .
pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic studies with as@@ thma in combination with er@@ y@@ thro@@ my@@ cin have not been performed , but the plasma levels of both medicines could be increased in the case of simultaneous administration .
the simultaneous application of twice daily 700 mg Fos@@ amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r and 100 mg of k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole once daily led to increasing the c@@ max of k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole in plasma by 25 % and the AU@@ C ( 0 @-@ τ ) at 2.@@ 69@@ times compared to the value observed once daily without simultaneous use of Fos@@ amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r with R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
other drugs that are listed below , including sub@@ strates , inhibit@@ ors or induc@@ tors of CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , may , if used together with A@@ gener@@ ase , may lead to interactions .
patients should therefore be supervised by toxic reactions associated with these drugs when used in combination with as@@ thma .
based on the data of other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors it is advisable that ant@@ acids are not taken at the same time as as@@ thma because it can cause res@@ or@@ ption problems .
the simultaneous use of anti@@ conv@@ ul@@ s@@ ants known as an enzyme ( phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , phen@@ ob@@ arb@@ ital , carb@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine ) , with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r can lead to a degra@@ dation of the plasma levels of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r .
ser@@ um concentrations of calcium channel block@@ ers such as am@@ lo@@ di@@ pine , dil@@ ti@@ az@@ em , Fel@@ odi@@ pine , Isra@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , N@@ isol@@ di@@ pine and Ver@@ ap@@ am@@ il can be increased by 10 by am@@ explo@@ avi@@ r , thus increasing the activity and toxic@@ ity of these drugs .
the simultaneous use of A@@ gener@@ ase can considerably increase plasma concentrations and ampli@@ fy associated side effects with P@@ DE@@ 5 inhibit@@ ors , including hyp@@ ot@@ en@@ sion , bl@@ ur@@ red vision and pri@@ ap@@ ism ( see paragraph 4.4 ) .
in a clinical study where R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r had given 100 mg capsules twice daily along with 50 µ@@ g flu@@ tic@@ as@@ on@@ pro@@ pi@@ on@@ ate in@@ tran@@ as@@ al ( 4 times daily ) over 7 days of test subjects , the flu@@ tic@@ as@@ on@@ pro@@ pi@@ on@@ ate plasma levels increased significantly , while the endo@@ genous cor@@ ti@@ sol decreased by about 86 % ( 90 % confidence interval 82 to 89 % ) .
as a result , the simultaneous administration of A@@ gener@@ ase with R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r is not recommended along with these glu@@ co@@ cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ides unless the possible benefit of a treatment out@@ weighs the risk of system@@ ic cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oi@@ des ( see section 4.4 ) .
in H@@ MG Co@@ A reduc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ ors such as Lov@@ ast@@ atin and Sim@@ v@@ ast@@ atin , whose metabol@@ isation is highly dependent on CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , pronounced increases in plasma levels are expected while administ@@ ering A@@ gener@@ ase .
since plasma level increases in these H@@ MG Co@@ A reduc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ ors lead to my@@ opath@@ y , including a R@@ hab@@ dom@@ y@@ oly@@ sis , the combined use of these drugs with Am@@ rit@@ avi@@ r is not recommended .
more frequent monitoring of the therapeutic concentrations is recommended up to the stabili@@ zation of the mirror , as the plasma concentrations of Cy@@ clos@@ por@@ ine , Rap@@ am@@ y@@ cin and Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus can be increased while the application of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is increased ( see section 4.4 ) .
therefore , A@@ gener@@ ase may not be used together with an ally taken mi@@ da@@ zol@@ am ( see Section 4.3 ) , while caution is required while using A@@ gener@@ ase with par@@ enter@@ al mi@@ da@@ zol@@ am .
data for simultaneous use of par@@ enter@@ al mi@@ da@@ zol@@ am with other prot@@ e@@ as@@ ein@@ hi@@ bit@@ ors point to a possible rise in plasma levels of mi@@ da@@ zol@@ am around the 3- to 4 @-@ fold .
if meth@@ ad@@ one is administered together with an amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r , the patients should therefore be monitored on os@@ pi@@ ate withdrawal symptoms , especially if low doses of R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r are administered .
because of the low reliability of historical compar@@ isons there is currently no recommendation on how to adapt the am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r@@ - dose if Am@@ rit@@ avi@@ r is administered simultaneously with meth@@ ad@@ one .
with the simultaneous administration of war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants , an increased control of IN@@ R ( International Norm@@ alised R@@ atio ) is recommended due to the possibility of atten@@ u@@ ation or strengthening of the anti@@ thro@@ m@@ bot@@ ic effect ( see section 4.4 ) .
the effect of an additional administration of R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r on hormon@@ al contra@@ cep@@ tives is not pre@@ dict@@ able , so alternative methods for contra@@ c@@ eption are also recommended .
careful monitoring of the therapeutic effects and side effects of tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ de@@ press@@ ants ( for example Des@@ i@@ pra@@ mine and Nor@@ tr@@ yp@@ ti@@ lin ) is recommended with the simultaneous administration of A@@ gener@@ ase ( see section 4.4 ) .
this medicine may be used during pregnancy only after careful weighing of possible benefits for the mother compared to the possible risks for the fet@@ us .
in the milk of lac@@ tation rats , amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r @-@ related substances have been detected , but it is not known whether the pren@@ atal ir@@ cle@@ avi@@ r passes into mother &apos;s milk .
a re@@ produci@@ ble study of pregnant rats , which was given by the dis@@ arm@@ ament in the uter@@ us to the end of the lac@@ tation period , showed a reduced increase in 12 body weight during breast@@ feeding .
the further development of the seed including fertility and reproductive capacity was not affected by the administration of amp@@ ou@@ avi@@ r to the dam .
the harm@@ lessness of as@@ re@@ ase was studied in adults and in children aged 4 years in controlled clinical trials in combination with various other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs .
most adverse events associated with the A@@ gener@@ ase treatment were mild to moderate , early on and rarely lead to treatment ab@@ out@@ ment .
in many of these events , it is not clear whether they are related to the use of as@@ par@@ ase or another medicine used at the same time for the treatment of HIV , or whether they are a result of the underlying disease .
most of the side effects listed below date from two clinical trials ( PRO@@ F@@ 300@@ 1 , PRO@@ T@@ 300@@ 6 ) , in which prot@@ e@@ ase inhibit@@ ors received 1200 mg of as@@ thma twice daily .
occur@@ ren@@ ces ( grade 2 to 4 ) evaluated by the investig@@ ators as related to the study medi@@ ation and performed in more than 1 % of patients , and laboratory changes occurring during the treatment ( Grade 3 to 4 ) are listed .
anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy was associated with re@@ distribution of body fat ( li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy ) in HIV patients , including loss of peripheral and facial sub@@ cut@@ aneous fatty tissue , increased intra@@ abdominal and vis@@ cer@@ al fat tissue , hyper@@ tro@@ phy of the breasts and dor@@ so@@ cervi@@ cal fat accumulation ( Sti@@ ern@@ acken ) .
under 113 anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ ally not pre@@ treated subjects treated with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r in combination with lam@@ iv@@ ud@@ ine / zi@@ do@@ v@@ ud@@ ine over a medium duration of 36 weeks , only one case was observed ( &lt; 1 % ) .
in the PRO@@ AB 300@@ 6 study , 245 N@@ R@@ TI@@ s previously treated 7 cases ( 3 % ) in 241 patients ( 11 % ) in 241 patients under In@@ din@@ avi@@ r , in combination with different N@@ R@@ TI@@ s over an average duration of 56 weeks ( p &lt; 0.0@@ 01 ) .
skin rash was usually mild to moderate , er@@ y@@ them@@ at@@ ous or mac@@ ular @-@ pap@@ ul@@ ous nature , with or without it@@ ching and spontane@@ ously occ@@ ured during the second week of treatment and disappeared spontane@@ ously within two weeks without the treatment had to be ab@@ orted with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r .
cases of o@@ ste@@ on@@ nec@@ ro@@ sis were reported in patients with commonly known risk factors , advanced HIV infection or long @-@ term application of anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy ( ART ) .
in HIV @-@ infected patients with severe immune defect , an anti @-@ retro@@ viral combination therapy ( ART ) can develop an inflammatory response to asy@@ mpt@@ om@@ atic or residual opportun@@ istic infections ( see section 4.4 ) .
in PI treated patients who received 600 mg of A@@ gener@@ ase twice daily along with low dos@@ ed R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( Grade 3 and 4 ) were comparable to those who were under sole as@@ thma @-@ treatment comparable ; one exception formed ca@@ vi@@ ties of tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eride and CP@@ K values , which were very common in patients who received A@@ gener@@ ase along with low dos@@ ed R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r .

the 50 % Hem@@ m@@ RNA concentration ( IC@@ 50 ) of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is in the range of 0.0@@ 12 to 0.0@@ 8 µ@@ M in acute infected cells and is 0.@@ 41 µ@@ M in the case of chronic infected cells
the relationship between the activity of the Am@@ rit@@ avi@@ r against HIV @-@ 1 in vitro and the in@@ hibition of HIV @-@ 1 rep@@ lication in humans is not yet defined .
in the treatment of anti@@ retro@@ viral @-@ not previously treated patients with the currently approved fos@@ amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r / R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r dos@@ ages - as with other R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r blocked treatment schem@@ as with prot@@ e@@ as@@ ein@@ hi@@ bit@@ ors - the mut@@ ations described only rarely were observed .
in sixteen of 4@@ 34 anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ ally @-@ untreated patients who received 700@@ mg of fos@@ amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r with 100mg R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily in the study ES@@ S@@ 100@@ 7@@ 32 , a vi@@ rolog@@ ical failure occurred up to week 48 , with 14 isol@@ ates being gen@@ otyp@@ ically examined .
a gen@@ otyp@@ ic analysis of the isol@@ ates of 13 out of 14 children , in which a vi@@ rolog@@ ical failure occurred within 59 patients treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors showed resistance patterns similar to those in adults .
L@@ 10@@ F / I / V , V@@ 11@@ I , I@@ 13@@ V , K@@ 20@@ R , V@@ 32@@ I , L@@ 33@@ F , E@@ 34@@ Q , M@@ 36@@ I , M@@ 46@@ I / L , I@@ 62@@ V , A@@ 7@@ 1@@ V , V@@ 77@@ I , V@@ 8@@ 2A / I , I@@ 84@@ V , I@@ 85@@ V , L@@ 90@@ M and I@@ 93@@ L / M .
in the AP@@ V@@ 300@@ 03 study and its extension AP@@ V@@ 300@@ 05 ( 700 mg Fos@@ amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r / 100 mg R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily : N = 107 ) on patients treated with prot@@ e@@ ase inhibit@@ ors over 96 weeks , the following prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors appeared :
gen@@ otyp@@ ic tests based on gen@@ otyp@@ ic resistance testing can be used to estimate the activity of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r or Fos@@ amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r / R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r in patients with prot@@ e@@ as@@ hi@@ inhibit@@ or @-@ resistant isol@@ ates .
the current ( July 2006 ) AN@@ RS @-@ AC @-@ 11 algorithm for Fos@@ amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r / R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r defines resistance as the presence of mut@@ ations V@@ 32@@ I + 14@@ 7@@ A / V , I@@ 62@@ V , V@@ 8@@ 2A / L / F / G , I@@ 84@@ V and L@@ 90@@ M in combination with increased phen@@ otyp@@ ic resistance to R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r and a decreased lik@@ eli@@ hood of vi@@ rolog@@ ical response ( resistance ) .
the conclusions regarding the relevance of certain mut@@ ations or mut@@ ation patterns may be subject to changes through additional data , and it is recommended to always consult the current interpretation systems for analy@@ sing the results of resistance tests .
phen@@ otyp@@ ic tests based on phen@@ otyp@@ ic resistance testing can be applied in combination with gen@@ otyp@@ ical data for ass@@ essing the activity of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r or Fos@@ amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r / R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r in patients with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ or resist@@ ent isol@@ ates .
companies that sell diagnostic resistance tests have developed clinical @-@ phen@@ otyp@@ ic Cut @-@ offs ( release points ) for F@@ PV / R@@ TV that can be used to interpret the results of a resistance test .
each of these four with reduced sensitivity to am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r associated genetic patterns creates a certain cross @-@ resistance against R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r , the sensitivity to in@@ din@@ avi@@ r , nel@@ fin@@ avi@@ r and sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r remains generally preserved .
there are currently data on cross @-@ resistance between am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors for all 4 Fos@@ amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r resistance paths , either alone or in combination with other mut@@ ations .
based on twenty @-@ five anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ ally @-@ not pre@@ treated patients , in which a fos@@ amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ rus @-@ containing regim@@ en failed ( one of them referred to a resistance to Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r and sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r ( three of 25 isol@@ ates ) , in@@ din@@ avi@@ r / R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( three of 24 isol@@ ates ) , sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r ( three of 24 isol@@ ates ) and Ti@@ den@@ avi@@ r / R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( four of 24 isol@@ ates ) .
in reverse , Am@@ rit@@ avi@@ r maintains its activity against some other prot@@ e@@ as@@ hi@@ inhibit@@ or resist@@ ent isol@@ ates ; maintaining this activity appears to be dependent on the number and type of resistance mut@@ ations in the isol@@ ates .
the early departure of a fail@@ ing therapy is recommended to stop the accumulation of a variety of mut@@ ations that can affect the subsequent treatment .
the evidence of the effectiveness of A@@ gener@@ ase in combination with R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg twice daily is based on the study PRO@@ 300@@ 17 , a random@@ ized open study , in which pre @-@ treated adults after vi@@ rolog@@ ical failure ( 100 mg twice daily ) or a standard therapy ( standard of care , SO@@ C ) with a PI , predominantly with low @-@ dose rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
one hundred and thre@@ es@@ core ( n = 163 ) patients with proven virus sensitivity to A@@ gener@@ ase , at least another PI and at least one N@@ RT@@ I were included in the Study A of PRO@@ 300@@ 17 .
the primary analysis showed the non @-@ su@@ pre@@ m@@ acy of AP@@ V / R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r compared to the time @-@ adjusted a@@ verages of the initial value ( A@@ AU@@ C@@ MB ) in the viral load ( HIV @-@ 1 RNA ) in the plasma after 16 weeks , with a non @-@ submission wave of 0.4 log@@ 10 copies / ml .
the evidence of the efficacy of non @-@ linked A@@ gener@@ ase is based on two un@@ controlled trials involving 288 HIV @-@ infected children aged 2 to 18 , of which 152 were pre @-@ treated with PI .
in the studies , A@@ gener@@ ase intake and capsule dosage of 15 mg / kg was three times daily , 20 mg / kg three times daily , 20 mg / kg twice daily and 2@@ 2.5 mg / kg twice daily , with the majority of patients receiving 20 mg / kg twice daily .
no low dos@@ ed R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r was given at the same time ; the majority of those previously treated with PI had at least one ( 78 % ) or two ( 42 % ) of N@@ R@@ TI@@ s administered together with A@@ gener@@ ase .
after 48 weeks , approximately 25 % of patients en@@ rolled in the study had a plasma @-@ HIV @-@ 1 RNA concentration &lt; 10,000 copies / ml and 9 % &lt; 400 copies / ml for a medi@@ an increase in CD@@ 4 cell count of 26 cells / mm ³ ( n = 74 ) compared to the initial value .
19 B@@ ased on these data , it should be considered in the treatment optimisation of children treated with PI from the expected benefit of &quot; un@@ blocked &quot; as@@ thma .
after oral administration the mean duration ( T@@ max ) up to the maximum ser@@ um concentration of Am@@ rit@@ avi@@ r amounts approximately 1 to 2 hours for the capsule and approximately 0.5 to 1 hour for the solution .
508 % increased , for c@@ max on the other hand reduced by 30 % when R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) was administered together with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) .
the administration of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r with a meal leads to a 25 % decline of the AU@@ C , but has no effect on the concentration of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r 12 hours after dosage ( C@@ 12 ) .
the minimum concentration in the ste@@ ady state ( C@@ min , ss ) was therefore un@@ affected by food intake , although the simultaneous absorption affects the extent and rate of res@@ or@@ ption .
the apparent distribution volume amounts to approx . 430 l ( 6 l / kg at a body weight of 70 kg ) and allows for a large distribution volume as well as an un@@ imp@@ eded penetration of the blood circulation into the tissue .
this change leads to a decrease in the total concentration of the active substance in the plasma , whereby the amount of an un@@ bound tube , which represents the active portion , is likely to remain unchanged .
while the absolute concentration of un@@ bound ampl@@ ona remains constant , the percentage of free active component during dosing intervals varies depending on the total pharmaceutical concentration in the Ste@@ ady State over the range from c@@ max , ss to C@@ min , ss .
therefore , pharmaceuticals that in@@ duce or inhi@@ bit CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , or a substrate of CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , must be administered with caution when given at the same time with a@@ gener@@ ase ( see sections 4.3 , 4.4 and 4.5 ) .
the gift of A@@ gener@@ ase capsules , either 20 mg / kg twice or 15 mg / kg three times daily , leads to similar daily ammon@@ ia exposure as in adults with a dose of 1200 mg twice daily .
pren@@ avi@@ r is from the solution 14 % less bio@@ available than from the capsules ; therefore , A@@ gener@@ ase Solution and A@@ gener@@ ase capsules are not ex@@ changeable on a milli@@ gram basis .
ren@@ al Clear@@ ance of R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r is also neg@@ li@@ gible , so the impact of ren@@ al dys@@ functions is likely to be low on the elimination of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and r@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
these regim@@ ens result in am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r plasma levels comparable to those that are achieved in healthy subjects after a dose of 1200 mg of Am@@ rit@@ avi@@ r twice daily without simultaneous administration of R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
in long @-@ term studies on the car@@ cin@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity of mice and rats , h@@ ep@@ ato@@ cri@@ ell@@ ular aden@@ omas occ@@ ured in male animals , which correspon@@ ded to the 2.0 @-@ fold ( mice ) or 3,@@ 8@@ - times ( rat ) of exposure to humans , after twice daily dose of 1200 mg of Am@@ rit@@ avi@@ r .
the underlying mechanism for the emergence of h@@ ep@@ ato@@ cy@@ cellular aden@@ omas and car@@ cin@@ omas has not yet been elu@@ ci@@ dated and the relevance of these observed effects for humans is un@@ clear .
however , from the present exposure data to humans , both from clinical studies and from the therapeutic application , there was little evidence of the adoption of a clinical relevance of these findings .
in a standard battery of In @-@ vi@@ vo@@ - and in @-@ vitro @-@ gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity tests containing bacterial reverse mut@@ ation tests ( Am@@ es test ) , mouse @-@ lymp@@ ho@@ m test , micro@@ kernel test on rats and chromos@@ om@@ al aber@@ ration tests on human peripheral lymp@@ ho@@ cytes , Am@@ rit@@ avi@@ r was neither mut@@ agen@@ ic nor gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic .
this liver toxic@@ ity can be monitored and proven in clinical daily life by measuring AST , AL@@ T and the activity of alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase .
until now , no significant liver toxic@@ ity in patients has been observed in clinical trials , neither during the administration of the bladder nor after the end of the treatment .
toxic@@ ity studies in young animals , which were treated at an age of 4 days , showed a high mort@@ ality in both the control animals and the animals treated with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r .
in a system@@ ic plasma exposition , which was significantly below ( ra@@ bb@@ its ) or not significantly higher ( rats ) than the expected exposure to humans , however , a number of minor changes including thy@@ mus jug@@ ation and minor skel@@ etal changes were observed , indicating delayed development .
24 If A@@ gener@@ ase capsules are applied without the additional addition of R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( boost ) , higher doses of as@@ re@@ ase ( 1200 mg twice daily ) must be applied .
the recommended dose for A@@ gener@@ ase capsules is 20 mg of Am@@ rit@@ avi@@ r / kg body weight twice daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs up to a daily maximum dosage of 2400 mg of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r that should not be exceeded ( see Section 5.1 ) .
the simultaneous application should be performed in patients with weak or slight liver function disorder , in patients with severe liver dysfunction they are contra@@ indicated ( see Section 4.3 ) .
26 For some medicines that can cause serious or life @-@ threatening side effects such as carb@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine , phen@@ ob@@ arb@@ ital , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ de@@ press@@ ants , and war@@ far@@ in ( under supervision of the International Norm@@ alised R@@ atio ) , methods are available to determine the drug concentration .
A@@ gener@@ ase should be canc@@ eled in the duration of 27 if a rash is accompanied by system@@ ic or allergic symptoms or the mu@@ c@@ ous membran@@ es are involved ( see paragraph 4.8 ) .
increased risk of li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy was associated with individual factors such as higher age , and drug @-@ dependent factors , such as a longer @-@ lasting anti@@ retro@@ viral treatment and associated metabolic disorders .
it has been shown that Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in causes 82 % reduction in the AU@@ C of Am@@ rit@@ avi@@ r , which can lead to vi@@ rolog@@ ical failure and resistance development .
508 % increased , for c@@ max however , reduced by 30 % when R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) was given in combination with amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r capsules ( 600 mg twice daily ) .
the C@@ min values of the plasma , which were achieved twice a day in the combination of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) with Kal@@ et@@ ra ( 400 mg of Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r + 100 mg of R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily ) , are approximately 40 to 50 % lower than when Am@@ rit@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) is administered twice daily in combination with 100 mg of R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
dosage recommendation for the simultaneous administration of Am@@ rit@@ avi@@ r and Kal@@ et@@ ra cannot be given , but a close monitoring is recommended , as the efficacy and safety of this combination is not known .
treatment with avi@@ ren@@ z in combination with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r is not recommended as exposure of both prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors would decrease .
if these drugs are used together , caution is advised ; thorough clinical and vi@@ rolog@@ ical monitoring should be carried out as an accurate pre@@ diction of the effect of the combination of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r is difficult on del@@ avi@@ r@@ din .
if it is necessary for clinical reasons to administ@@ er the ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin together with A@@ gener@@ ase , a reduction in the dosage of ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin is recommended to at least half of the recommended dose 31 , although there are no clinical data available .
ser@@ um concentrations of calcium channel block@@ ers such as am@@ lo@@ di@@ pine , dil@@ ti@@ az@@ em , Fel@@ odi@@ pine , Isra@@ di@@ pine , Nic@@ ardi@@ pin , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , N@@ isol@@ di@@ pine and Ver@@ ap@@ am@@ il can be increased by am@@ explo@@ avi@@ r , thus increasing the activity and toxic@@ ity of these drugs .
in a clinical study where R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r had given 100 mg capsules twice daily along with 50 µ@@ g flu@@ tic@@ as@@ on@@ pro@@ pi@@ on@@ ate in@@ tran@@ as@@ al ( 4 times daily ) over 7 days of test subjects , the flu@@ tic@@ as@@ on@@ pro@@ pi@@ on@@ ate plasma levels increased significantly , while the endo@@ genous cor@@ ti@@ sol decreased by about 86 % ( 90 % confidence interval 82 to 89 % ) .
with the simultaneous administration of war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants , an increased control of IN@@ R ( International Norm@@ alised R@@ atio ) is recommended due to the possibility of atten@@ u@@ ation or strengthening of the anti@@ thro@@ m@@ bot@@ ic effect ( see section 4.4 ) .
the simultaneous administration of Orth@@ o @-@ Nov@@ um 1 / 35 ( 0.0@@ 35 mg E@@ thin@@ yl est@@ radi@@ ol plus 1.0 mg Nor@@ eth@@ in@@ dr@@ on ) led to a decrease of the AU@@ C and C@@ min by Am@@ rit@@ avi@@ r by 22 % respectively .
this drug may be used during pregnancy only after careful weighing of possible benefits for the mother compared to possible risks for the fo@@ etus .
a reproduction study on pregnant rats , which was given by the em@@ aking in the uter@@ us to the end of the lac@@ tation period , showed a dimin@@ ished increase in body weight during breast@@ feeding .
the harm@@ lessness of as@@ re@@ ase was studied in adults and in children aged 4 years in controlled clinical trials in combination with various other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs .
in the case of an over@@ dose , the patient is able to observe signs of in@@ toxic@@ ation ( see paragraph 4.8 ) if necessary to initiate necessary supporting measures .
the anti@@ viral activity of amp@@ pren@@ avi@@ r in vitro against HIV @-@ 1 II@@ I@@ B has been studied in acute and chronic lymp@@ ho@@ blas@@ tic cell lines ( MT @-@ 4 , CE@@ M @-@ C@@ CR@@ F , H@@ 9 ) and peripheral blood lymp@@ ho@@ cytes .
the 50 % Hem@@ m@@ RNA concentration ( IC@@ 50 ) of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is in the range from 0.0@@ 12 to 0.0@@ 8 µ@@ M in acute infected cells and is 0.@@ 41 µ@@ M in the case of chronic infected cells ( 1 µ@@ M = 0.@@ 50 µ@@ g / ml ) .
in reverse , Am@@ rit@@ avi@@ r maintains its activity against some other prot@@ e@@ as@@ hi@@ inhibit@@ or resist@@ ent isol@@ ates ; maintaining this activity appears to be dependent on the number and type of resistance mut@@ ations in the isol@@ ates .
based on these data , the anticipated benefits of &quot; un@@ blocked &quot; as@@ thma should be considered in the treatment optimisation of children treated with PI .
while absolute concentration of un@@ born am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r remains constant , the percentage of free active component during dosing intervals varies depending on the total pharmaceutical concentration in the Ste@@ ady State over the range from c@@ max , ss to C@@ min , ss ..
therefore , pharmaceuticals that in@@ duce or inhi@@ bit CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , or a substrate of CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , must be administered with caution when given at the same time with a@@ gener@@ ase ( see sections 4.3 , 4.4 and 4.5 ) .

toxic@@ ity studies in young animals , which were treated at an age of 4 days , showed a high mort@@ ality in both the control animals and the animals treated with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r .

A@@ gener@@ ase &apos;s solution to intake is shown in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs for the treatment of HIV @-@ 1 @-@ infected , prot@@ e@@ ase inhibit@@ ors ( PI ) pre@@ treated adults and children from 4 years onwards .
the benefit of R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r B@@ oo@@ ster@@ ter &quot; A@@ gener@@ ase &quot; solution for inhal@@ ing was neither demonstrated to patients previously treated with PI or with PI previously treated .
the bio@@ availability of Am@@ rit@@ avi@@ r as a solution to intake is by 14 % lower than from Am@@ rit@@ avi@@ r as capsule ; therefore , A@@ gener@@ ase capsules and solution are not inter@@ changeable for taking on a milli@@ gram per milli@@ gram basis ( see Section 5.2 ) .
patients should , as soon as they are able to swal@@ low the capsules , stop taking the solution to intake ( see section 4.4 ) .
the recommended dose for A@@ gener@@ ase solution is 17 mg ( 1.1 ml ) Am@@ rit@@ avi@@ r / kg body weight three times a day in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs up to a daily maximum dose of 2800 mg of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r that should not be exceeded ( see Section 5.1 ) .
in addition , as no dosage recommendation is required for the simultaneous application of A@@ gener@@ ase solution to intake and low dos@@ ed R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r , this combination can be avoided in these patient groups .
although dose adjustment is not deemed necessary for amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r , an application of A@@ gener@@ ase is contra@@ indicated in patients with kidney failure ( see Section 4.3 ) .
due to the potential risk of toxic reaction as a result of the high propylene gly@@ col content , A@@ gener@@ ase is contra@@ indicated in pregnant women , in pregnant women , in patients with reduced liver function or liver failure and in patients with kidney failure .
simultaneous administration may lead to a competitive suspension of drug metabolism and may cause serious and / or life @-@ threatening side effects such as cardiac ar@@ rhyth@@ mia ( z ) .
patients should be advised that as@@ thma or any other anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy does not lead to curing the HIV infection and that they continue to develop opportun@@ istic infections or other complications of HIV infection .
the present anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy including treatment with A@@ gener@@ ase does not prevent the risk 47 of HIV transmission to others through sexual contact or contamination with blood .
for some medicines which can cause serious or life @-@ threatening side effects such as carb@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine , phen@@ ob@@ arb@@ ital , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ de@@ press@@ ants and war@@ far@@ in ( under supervision of the International Norm@@ alised R@@ atio ) , methods for determining the drug concentration are available .

in hem@@ ophi@@ lic patients ( type A and B ) treated with prot@@ e@@ ase inhibit@@ ors , there are reports of an increase in bleeding , including spontaneous cut@@ aneous hem@@ at@@ omas and ha@@ em@@ o@@ arthritis .
it has been shown that Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in causes 82 % reduction in the AU@@ C of Am@@ rit@@ avi@@ r , which can lead to vi@@ rolog@@ ical failure and resistance development .
508 % increased , for c@@ max however , reduced by 30 % when R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) was given in combination with amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r capsules ( 600 mg twice daily ) .
the simultaneous use of A@@ gener@@ ase can considerably increase plasma concentrations and lead to adverse events associated with P@@ DE@@ 5 inhibit@@ ors including hyp@@ ot@@ en@@ sion , vision distur@@ ban@@ ces and pri@@ ap@@ ism ( see paragraph 4.4 ) .
on the basis of the data on 54 other CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors , higher plasma concentrations of Mi@@ da@@ zol@@ am are expected after oral administration of Mi@@ da@@ zol@@ am .
the potential risk for humans is unknown . as@@ par@@ ase solution for inhal@@ ing may not be used during pregnancy because of possible toxic reactions of the fet@@ us ( see Section 4.3 ) .

the application frequency and duration of the treatment with al@@ dar@@ a depend on the condition to be treated : • For small bas@@ al cell car@@ cin@@ omas , the cream can be applied 5 times a week for six weeks . • At ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ osis it is possible to apply three times a week during one or two four @-@ week treatment cycles .
before bed@@ time , the cream is thin @-@ layer on the affected areas of the skin so that it stays on the skin sufficiently long ( about eight hours ) before it is washed away .
in all studies , Al@@ dar@@ a was compared with a plac@@ ebo ( same cream , but without the active ingredient ) . • Al@@ dar@@ a was tested in four main studies on 9@@ 23 patients with war@@ ts in the genital area each for 16 weeks .
the main indicator for efficacy was the number of patients with complete healing of the treated war@@ ts . • Al@@ dar@@ a was also studied in 7@@ 24 patients with small bas@@ al cell car@@ cin@@ omas in two studies , in which the patients were treated for six weeks and al@@ dar@@ a or plac@@ ebo performed either daily or five times a week .
the main indicator for efficacy was the number of patients with complete healing of tum@@ ours after 12 weeks . • Al@@ dar@@ a was also tested in two studies on a total of 505 patients with ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ osis .
in all studies , Al@@ dar@@ a was more effective than plac@@ ebo . • In the treatment of patients in the genital area , the complete healing rate was 15 % to 52 % in patients treated with plac@@ ebo . • The results from both studies on bas@@ al cell car@@ cin@@ oma showed a complete healing rate of 66 % to 80 % in the plac@@ ebo @-@ treated patients compared to 0 % to 3 % .
the most common side effects of Al@@ dar@@ a ( observed in more than 1 out of 10 patients ) are reactions at the point of application of the cream ( pain or it@@ ching ) .
clin@@ ically typical , non @-@ hyper@@ tro@@ phi@@ c , non @-@ hyper@@ tro@@ phi@@ c ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ osis ( AK@@ s ) in the face or scal@@ p in immun@@ o@@ competent adults , when the size or number of les@@ ions limit the effectiveness and / or the acceptance of cr@@ y@@ otherapy and other top@@ ical treatment options are contra@@ indicated or less suitable .
Monday , Wednesday and Friday or Tuesday , Thursday and Saturday before going to bed and leave for 6 to 10 hours on the skin .
the treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream is to continue until all visible co@@ wards have disappeared in the genital or peri@@ anal region , or up to a maximum of 16 weeks per treatment period .
an inter@@ ruption in the treatment course described above should be considered when intensive local inflammation reactions occur ( see section 4.4 ) or when an infection is observed in the treatment area .
if the treated les@@ ions are completely healed after the follow @-@ up examination 4 to 8 weeks after the second treatment period , another therapy should be started ( see section 4.4 ) .
when a dose is om@@ itted , the patient sol@@ ves the cream as soon as he / she not@@ ices this and then continue with the usual therapy plan .
apply i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream in a thin layer and rub in clean@@ sed , infected skin areas until the cream is fully absorbed .
there should be a balancing between the benefits of treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od and the risk associated with a possible wor@@ sen@@ ing of auto@@ immune disease .
it should take place in these patients between the benefits of a treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od and the risk associated with a possible organ rejection or gra@@ ft @-@ versus @-@ host reaction .
in other studies where no daily h@@ auth@@ y@@ gi@@ ene was performed , two cases of severe phi@@ mo@@ sis and one case were observed with a t@@ inc@@ ision leading to circumc@@ ision .
in case of an application of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ Creme in higher than the recommended doses there is an increased risk of severe local skin irrit@@ ation ( see Section 4.2 . ) In rare cases , severe local skin irrit@@ ations were observed , which necess@@ itated a treatment and / or led to a temporary physical impair@@ ment .
in cases where such reactions occurred at the outlet of the ureth@@ ra , some women had difficulty passing urine that necess@@ itated emergency cath@@ eter@@ isation and treatment of the area affected .
until now , no clinical experience is available to use I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream immediately following treatment with other cut@@ aneous @-@ applied remedies for treating external co@@ wards in the genital and per@@ ch area .
limited data points to an increased rate of anti @-@ drug reductions in HIV positive patients , but I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream has shown a lower effectiveness in this group of patients with regard to the elimination of genital war@@ ts .
the treatment of bas@@ al cell car@@ cin@@ oma with i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od within 1 cm around the eyel@@ ids , nose , lips , or hair attachment was not examined .
local skin reactions are common , but the intensity of these reactions decreases generally during therapy or the reactions form after completion of treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream .
if it is necessary due to patient &apos;s complaints or due to the sever@@ ity of local skin reactions , a treatment break can be made several days .
the clinical outcome of the therapy can be assessed after the regeneration of the treated skin approximately 12 weeks after the end of the treatment .
since no data on long @-@ term cure rates are available for more than 36 months after the treatment , other suitable therapy forms should be considered for super@@ ficial bas@@ al cell car@@ cin@@ omas .
patients with recur@@ rent and pre@@ treated BC@@ Cs do not have clinical experience , therefore the application is not recommended in pre @-@ treated tum@@ ors .
data from an open clinical study point out that in large tum@@ ours ( &gt; 7.@@ 25 cm2 ) there is less lik@@ eli@@ hood of response to I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od therapy .
I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od was not examined for the treatment of ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ osis on eyel@@ ids , inside the nose or the ears or on the lip area inside the Li@@ ppen@@ rot .
there are only very limited data on the use of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od for the treatment of ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ osis in anatom@@ ical places outside the face and scal@@ p .
the available data on the ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ osis on the for@@ ear@@ ms and hands do not support the effectiveness of this application , therefore such an application is not recommended .
local skin reactions often occur , but these reactions usually decrease in intensity over the course of therapy or go back after the treatment with@@ i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream .
if the local skin reactions to the patient are causing great dis@@ comfort or are very strong , treatment may be suspended for a few days .
data from an open clinical study shows that patients with more than 8 les@@ ions reported a lower total cure rate than patients with fewer than 8 les@@ ions .
due to the immune @-@ stimulating properties I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream should be applied with caution in patients receiving immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive treatment ( see 4.4 ) .
from animal studies there are no direct or indirect harmful effects on pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , child@@ birth or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see 5.3 ) .
even though quanti@@ fiable level of ser@@ um levels ( &gt; 5@@ n@@ g / ml ) cannot be quanti@@ fied according to a unique or repeated top@@ ical application , no recommendation can be given during breast@@ feeding .
the most commonly shared and possibly or possibly associated side effects associated with the application of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream in the trials involving three times weekly treatment were local reactions in the field of the treatment of wards war@@ ts ( 33.@@ 7 % of patients treated with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od ) .
among the most commonly reported and possibly or possibly associated with the application of the I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream related side effects include complaints at the application location with a frequency of 28.@@ 1 % .
patients treated with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ cream treated bas@@ ali@@ oma patients from a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled phase III clinical trial reported side effects are shown below .
the most common , as likely , or possibly with the application of the I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream in connection with the adverse side effect , were a response to the application location ( 22 % of the patients treated with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od ) .
the side effects reported by 252 in plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled phase III clinical trials with i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream treated patients with ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ osis are listed below .
the evaluation of clinical signs fores@@ een according to the test plan shows that in these plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled clinical trials with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cr@@ ème frequent local skin reactions including er@@ y@@ thema ( 61 % ) , ero@@ sion ( 30 % ) , ex@@ k@@ ori@@ ation / sc@@ roll ( 23 % ) and ede@@ ma ( 14 % ) came ( see section 4.4 ) .
the evaluation of clinical signs fores@@ een according to the test plan shows that in these studies , five times weekly treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream very often resulted in severe er@@ y@@ thema ( 31 % ) , severe ero@@ sions ( 13 % ) , and to serious atro@@ phy and ev@@ ap@@ oration ( 19 % ) .
in clinical trials investigating the use of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od for the treatment of ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ osis , al@@ op@@ eci@@ a was detected with a frequency of 0.4 % ( 5 / 12@@ 14 ) at the treatment centre or in the surrounding area .
the in@@ adver@@ t@@ ingly unique oral absorption of 200 mg of i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od , which corresponds to the content of about 16 bags , could lead to nausea , vom@@ iting , head@@ ache , my@@ al@@ gia and fever .
the clin@@ ically most severe side effect , which occurred after several oral doses of &gt; 200 mg , consisted of hyp@@ ot@@ ony that norm@@ alized according to oral or intra@@ ven@@ ous fluid .
in a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic study , increasing system@@ ic concentrations of alpha interfer@@ ons and other cy@@ tok@@ ines were detected after the top@@ ical application of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od .
3 efficacy studies in 3 piv@@ otal Phase 3 showed that efficacy was significantly superior with regard to complete healing of appropri@@ ation in I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od over 16 weeks of plac@@ ebo treatment .
60 % of patients who had treated with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od treated patients completely ; this was the case with 20 % of the 105 patients who had been treated with plac@@ ebo ( 95 % CI ) :
total healing could be achieved at 23 % of 157 patients treated with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od , compared to 5 % of 161 male patients treated with plac@@ ebo ( 95 % CI ) :
the efficacy of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od in five times application per week over 6 weeks was examined in two double @-@ blind plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled clinical trials .
the target populations were hist@@ ologically confirmed individual primary super@@ ficial cell car@@ cin@@ omas with a minimum size of 0.5 cm2 and a maximum diameter of 2 cm .
data from an open , un@@ controlled long @-@ term study after four years showed that approximately 7@@ 9.@@ 3 % &#91; 95 % CI ( 7@@ 3.7 % , 8@@ 4.@@ 9 % ) &#93; of all treated patients were clin@@ ically cured and remained for 48 months .
the efficacy of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od in three weeks of treatment in one or two treatment periods of 4 weeks , interrupted by a four @-@ week , treatment @-@ free period , was examined in two double @-@ blind , plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled clinical trials .
patients had clin@@ ically typical , visible , dis@@ crete , non @-@ hyper@@ tro@@ phi@@ c , non @-@ hyper@@ tro@@ phi@@ c les@@ ions within a coher@@ ent 25 cm2 treatment area on the untreated scal@@ p or face .
the results of two combined observation studies show a recur@@ rence rate of 27 % ( 35 / 128 patients ) for patients with clinical healing after one or two treatment periods .
the approved indications External F@@ eig@@ ni@@ ces , Ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ osis and Super@@ fi@@ zi@@ al bas@@ al cell car@@ cin@@ oma do not normally appear in pa@@ edi@@ at@@ ric patients and were therefore not examined .
Al@@ dar@@ a cream was studied in four random@@ ised , double @-@ blind plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled trials involving children between 2 and 15 years with Mol@@ lus@@ cum cont@@ ag@@ i@@ os@@ um ( I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od n = 5@@ 76 , plac@@ ebo n = 3@@ 13 ) .
the efficacy of i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od could not be shown in these studies in the doses investigated there ( 3x / week for a period of ≤ 16 weeks res@@ p . ) .
a minimal system@@ ic absorption of the 5 % I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream through the skin of 58 patients with ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ osis was observed during the three times weekly application for 16 weeks .
the highest drug concentrations in the ser@@ um at the end of the week 16 were observed between 9 and 12 hours and were 0.1 , 0.2 and 1.6 n@@ g / ml in the face ( 12.5 mg , 1 dispos@@ able bag ) , on the scal@@ p ( 25 mg , 2 bags ) and on the hands / arms ( 75 mg , 6 bags ) .
the calculated apparent half @-@ life period was approximately 10 times higher than the two @-@ hour half @-@ time after sub@@ cut@@ aneous use in an earlier study ; this indicates an extended retention of the medicine in the skin .
the data on system@@ ic exposure showed that the res@@ or@@ ption of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od after top@@ ical application on MC @-@ infected skin was low and comparable to that in healthy adults and adults with ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ osis or super@@ ficial bas@@ al cell car@@ cin@@ oma .
in a four @-@ month study to der@@ mal toxic@@ ity in rats , doses of 0.5 and 2.5 mg / kg KG resulted in significantly reduced body weight and increased mil@@ z weight ; a study for the der@@ mal application carried out for four months did not reveal similar effects with the mouse .
a two @-@ year study on car@@ cin@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity in mice at mal@@ er administration on three days a week did not in@@ duce a tumor in the application .
the corresponding mechanism is not known , but since I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od has only a low system@@ ic absorption from the human skin and is not mut@@ agen , there is a risk for humans to be regarded as very low due to system@@ ic exposure .
the tum@@ ors appeared in the group of mice treated with the active @-@ free cream , earlier and in greater numbers than in the control group with low UV@@ R .

inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if any of the listed side effects may significantly affect you or notice side effects that are not indicated in this use information .
in addition , you can feel it@@ ching ( 32 % of patients ) , burning ( 26 % of patients ) or pain in the areas you have applied Al@@ dar@@ a cream ( 8 % of patients ) .
most of the time , there are lighter skin reactions which end up again within about 2 weeks after the treatment has been removed .
occasionally some patients notice changes in the application location ( wound secre@@ tions , inflammation , swelling , shr@@ ink@@ age , skin destruction , bli@@ sters , der@@ mati@@ tis ) or irrit@@ ability , nausea , dry mouth , flu @-@ like symptoms and fatigue .
occasionally some patients suffer from changes to the application location ( bleeding , inflammation , wound secre@@ tions , ul@@ cer@@ ation , heat feeling or dis@@ comfort ) , inflammation of the nas@@ al mu@@ cos@@ a , irrit@@ ation of the eye li@@ ds , sore throat , diarr@@ hea , ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ osis , redness , facial swelling , ul@@ c@@ ers , aching limbs , fever , weakness , or ch@@ ills .
Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me is used for enzyme replacement therapy in patients with assured diagnosis of a Mu@@ cop@@ oly@@ sac@@ chari@@ dosis I ( M@@ PS I ; α -@@ L @-@ I@@ dur@@ on@@ id@@ ase deficiency ) in order to treat the not neurolog@@ ical manifest@@ ations of the disease ( the symptoms that are not associated with brain or nerves ) .
this means that certain substances ( gly@@ cos@@ amin@@ og@@ ly@@ cans , g@@ ags ) are not broken down and thus accum@@ ulate in most organs in the body and damage them .
the following not neurolog@@ ical symptoms of the M@@ PS I can occur : enlarged liver , sti@@ ff joints , which complic@@ ate movements , decreased lung volume , heart and eye diseases .
treatment with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ ma should be monitored by a doctor who has experience in the treatment of patients with M@@ PS I or other her@@ edi@@ tary metabolic disorders .
the administration of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should be carried out in a hospital or clinic with re@@ vit@@ alisation aids , and patients may need appropriate drugs before administration to prevent an allergic reaction .

in the study , the safety of the drug was mainly examined , but its effectiveness was also measured ( by exam@@ ining its effect on reducing the concentrations of G@@ AG in the urine and in relation to the size of the liver ) .
in children under five years , Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me lowered the concentrations of G@@ AG in the urine by about 60 % , and half of the children treated had a normal sized liver at the end of the study .
the most common side effects of al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in patients aged more than five years ( observed in more than 1 out of 10 patients ) are head@@ aches , nausea , abdominal pain , ar@@ thr@@ al@@ gia ( joint pain ) , back pain , pain in extre@@ mi@@ ties ( in hands and feet ) , heat feeling , fever and reactions to the fusion site .
very common side effects in patients under five years of age are elevated blood pressure , decreased oxygen satur@@ ation ( a measurement size of lung function ) , t@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ dia ( accelerated heart rate ) , fever and shi@@ vering .
Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me may not be used in patients who may be highly hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase or one of the other components ( an@@ aphy@@ lac@@ tic reaction ) .
each year , the European Medic@@ ines Agency ( E@@ MEA ) will review all new information that may be known , and where necessary update this summary .
the producer of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me will observe patients who receive al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me with regard to the reactions to the in@@ fusion and the development of antibodies .
in June 2003 , the European Commission granted approval to the company Gen@@ zy@@ me Europe B.@@ V. for the transport of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me throughout the European Union .
Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase is a re@@ combin@@ ant form of the human α -@@ L I@@ dur@@ on@@ id@@ ase and is produced using re@@ combin@@ ant DNA technology using CH@@ O @-@ mam@@ mal cell cultures ( Chinese ham@@ ster O@@ vary , ov@@ ary of the Chinese ham@@ ster ) .
Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me is indicated for long @-@ term enzyme replacement therapy in patients with assured diagnosis of Mu@@ cop@@ oly@@ sac@@ chari@@ dosis I ( M@@ PS I , α -@@ L I@@ dur@@ on@@ id@@ ase deficiency ) in order to treat the non @-@ neurolog@@ ical manifest@@ ations of the disease ( see Section 5.1 ) .
treatment with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ ma should be done by a doctor who has experience in the treatment of patients with M@@ PS I or other her@@ edi@@ tary metabolic diseases .
the initial fusion rate of 2 E / kg / h can be increased every 15 minutes in single steps to a maximum dose of 43 E / kg / h .
the safety and efficacy of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in adults over 65 years has not been determined , and no dosing schedule can be recommended for these patients .
the safety and efficacy of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in patients with kidney or liver failure was not determined , and no dosing schedule could be recommended for these patients .
patients treated with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me can develop in@@ fusion @-@ related reactions that are defined as any adverse side effect that occurs during in@@ fusion or until the end of the in@@ fusion day ( see paragraph 4.8 ) .
for this reason , especially these patients should continue to be closely monitored and the in@@ fusion of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should only be carried out in an appropriate clinical environment where re@@ vit@@ alisation devices for medical emer@@ gen@@ cies are immediately available .
due to the clinical phase 3 study , it is expected that almost all patients form Ig@@ G antibodies against Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase , usually within 3 months from the beginning of treatment .
patients who develop antibodies or symptoms of an in@@ fusion @-@ conditional reaction must be treated with caution when using Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ ma ( see sections 4.3 and 4.8 ) .
since there is little experience regarding the res@@ um@@ ption of treatment after a longer break , due to the theore@@ tically increased risk of hyper@@ sensitivity reactions following an inter@@ ruption of the treatment must be dealt with cau@@ ti@@ ously .
60 minutes before the start of in@@ fusion with medication ( anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines and / or anti@@ py@@ re@@ tics ) to prevent the potential occurrence of in@@ fusion @-@ related reactions .
in case of mild or medium @-@ severe in@@ fusion @-@ related reaction treatment with anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines and par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol / i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen should be induced and / or reduction of the fusion rate to half of the in@@ fusion rate in which the reaction occurred .
in the event of a single , severe inf@@ usi@@ onal reaction , the in@@ fusion must be stopped until the symptoms have been reduced , treatment with anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines and par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol / i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen is to be considered .
the in@@ fusion can be res@@ um@@ ed again with a reduction in the fusion rate to 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of the in@@ fusion rate in which the reaction occurred .
3 ( anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines and par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol / i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen and / or cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids ) as well as reduction of the fusion rate to 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of the in@@ fusion rate in which the previous reaction occurred .
Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should not be used at the same time with chlor@@ o@@ qu@@ ine or proc@@ aine because there is a potential risk of interfer@@ ing with intra@@ cellular in@@ takes of Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase .
experimental studies do not imp@@ ly direct or indirect adverse effects on pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , birth and post@@ nat@@ al development ( see Section 5.3 ) .
since no data is available to new@@ bor@@ ns exposed to lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase via breast milk , it is recommended not to breast@@ feed with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me during treatment .
the side effects in clinical trials were mainly classified as in@@ fusion @-@ related reactions which were observed in 53 % of patients in the Phase 3 study ( duration of treatment up to 4 years ) and 35 % of patients in the study with participants under 5 years ( duration of treatment up to 1 year ) .
adverse drug reactions in connection with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me observed during the 3 @-@ 3 trial and their pro@@ long@@ ation in a total of 45 patients at the age of 5 or older in a treatment period of up to 4 years are listed in the following table according to the following frequency : very common ( ≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10 ) .
in some patients with severe M@@ PS @-@ I @-@ related involvement of the upper respiratory tract and lungs in the pre@@ history , severe reactions also occurred , including bron@@ ch@@ osp@@ as@@ m , respiratory failure and facial ede@@ ma ( see section 4.4 ) .
children Un@@ wanted drug interactions with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me , which were reported in a phase 2 study with a total of 20 patients at the age of 5 , with predominantly severe course of course and a treatment duration of up to 12 months , are listed in the table .
100 E / kg intra@@ ven@@ ously once weekly ( recommended dose ) , 200 E / kg intra@@ ven@@ ously once weekly , 200 E / kg intra@@ ven@@ ously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intra@@ ven@@ ously every 2 weeks .
in most patients , a ser@@ o@@ con@@ ic version occurred within 3 months after the beginning of the treatment , with a he@@ avier follow @-@ up form in patients aged 5 years ( average after 26 days compared to 45 days in patients aged 5 and older ) .
until the end of the phase 3 trial ( or up to a premature departure from the study ) , there were no antibodies available in 13 / 45 patients by radio@@ immun@@ op@@ recip@@ itation ( RI@@ P ) ass@@ ay , among them 3 patients , with whom it had never been too Ser@@ o@@ con@@ vol@@ ous .
patients with missing to low antibody levels showed a robust reduction in the level of G@@ AG in the urine while a variable reduction of G@@ AG in urine was observed in patients with high antibody ti@@ ters .
four patients ( three in phase 3 study and one in phase 2 study ) showed a marginal to low neutr@@ alizing inhibit@@ ory effect on enzy@@ matic lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase activity in vitro , which did not seem to imp@@ air clinical efficacy and / or reduction of G@@ AG in urine .
the presence of antibodies did not seem to be related to the incidence of adverse drug reactions although the incidence of adverse drug reactions typically coinci@@ ded with the formation of Ig@@ G antibodies .
the reason for the enzyme replacement therapy is one of the hydro@@ ly@@ sis of accumulated sub@@ str@@ ats and the prevention of further accumulation of sufficient enzyme activity .
after intra@@ ven@@ ous in@@ fusion , the lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase is rapidly removed from the circulation and taken into the ly@@ s@@ os@@ omes , most likely via man@@ nose @-@ 6 @-@ phosph@@ ate recept@@ ors .
the safety and efficacy of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ zy@@ me were studied in a random@@ ised , double @-@ blind , plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled Phase 3 study at 45 patients aged 6 to 43 years .
although patients were recru@@ ited for the study covering the entire spectrum of the disease , the majority of patients were from the middle phen@@ otype and only one patient showed the severe phen@@ otype .
patients were recru@@ ited if they had a forced exp@@ iratory volume ( FE@@ V ) of less than 80 % of the expected value , and they had to be able to stand 6 minutes and walk 5 meters .
the primary end@@ points for the efficacy were the percentage change of the expected FE@@ V and the absolute foot@@ path in the 6 @-@ minute walk test .
all patients were subsequently recru@@ ited for an open label extension study where they received 100 E / kg al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me for another 3.5 years ( 182 weeks ) each week .
after 26 weeks of therapy the patients treated with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me showed an improvement in lung function and the ability to stay , which is shown in the following table .
the open extension study showed an improvement and / or maintenance of these effects of up to 208 weeks in the Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me / Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me group and from 182 weeks in the plac@@ ebo / Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me group , as highlighted in the following table .
the decrease in the percentage of FE@@ V to be expected is not clin@@ ically significant over this period and the absolute pul@@ mon@@ ary volumes increased disp@@ rop@@ or@@ tion@@ ately to the height of growing children .
of the 26 patients with a H@@ ep@@ atom@@ eg@@ aly before treatment 22 ( 85 % ) reached normal liver size until the end of the study .
within the first 4 weeks , a significant decrease of the G@@ AG level in the urine ( µ@@ g / mg ker@@ at@@ in@@ ine ) was observed , which remained constant until the end of the study .
with regard to the hetero@@ geneous disease manifestation between the patients taking into account the clin@@ ically significant changes overall for five efficacy @-@ variable ( expected percentage of normal FE@@ V , distance in the 6 @-@ minute walk , motion range of the shoulder joint A@@ HI and visual acu@@ ity ) , there was generally an improvement in 10 patients ( 22 % ) and a deteri@@ oration in 9 patients ( 20 % ) .
a one @-@ year open phase 2 study was carried out in which the safety and pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me were examined in 20 patients at the time of their inclusion in the study under 5 years of age ( 16 patients with severe de@@ formation and 4 with the mean follow @-@ up form ) .
in four patients the dosage was increased to 200 E / kg because of increased Gag@@ - mirrors in the urine in week 22 in the last 26 weeks .
in several patients a size growth ( n = 7 ) and weight gain ( n = 3 ) were determined according to the Z @-@ S@@ core for this age group The younger patients with the severe follow @-@ up form showed normal mental development speed , whereas in the older patients with severe de@@ formation , only limited or no advances in cognitive development were to be detected .
in a phase 4 study , studies on the pharmac@@ o@@ dynamic effects of various al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me dos@@ ages were carried out on the G@@ AG mirror in the urine , liver volume and 6 @-@ minute walking test .
100 E / kg intra@@ ven@@ ously once weekly ( recommended dose ) , 200 E / kg intra@@ ven@@ ously once weekly , 200 E / kg intra@@ ven@@ ously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intra@@ ven@@ ously every 2 weeks .
the dosage regim@@ en with 200 E / kg intra@@ ven@@ ously every 2 weeks can represent a justi@@ fiable alternative in patients who have difficulties with weekly in@@ fusion . however , it is not proven that the long @-@ term clinical effectiveness of these two dosing regim@@ ens is equivalent .
the European Medic@@ ines Agency ( E@@ MEA ) will evaluate any new information available annually , and if necessary , the summary of the characteristics of the medicine will be updated .
the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic profile in patients aged under 5 years was similar to those affected by older and less severely affected patients .

in patients suffering from M@@ PS I , an enzyme called α -@@ L @-@ I@@ dur@@ on@@ id@@ ase , which spl@@ its certain substances in the body ( gly@@ cos@@ amin@@ og@@ ly@@ cans ) , is either in a small amount or this enzyme is missing completely .
if you are allergic ( hyper@@ sensitive ) to one of the components of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me or if you have encountered a severe allergic reaction to lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase .
an in@@ fusion @-@ related reaction is any side effect that occurs during in@@ fusion or until the end of the in@@ fusion day ( see paragraph 4 &quot; Which side effects are possible &quot; ) .
when using Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me with other medicines , please inform your doctor if you are taking medicines that contain chlor@@ o@@ qu@@ ine or proc@@ aine because there is a possible risk of dimin@@ ished efficacy of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me .
please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you have taken other medicines or have recently taken medicines , including non @-@ prescription drugs .
instructions for use - di@@ lution and application The concentrate for the production of an in@@ fusion solution must be dil@@ uted prior to application and is intended for intra@@ ven@@ ous application ( see information for doctors and medical specialists ) .
the initial fusion rate of 2 E / kg / h can be increased every 15 minutes to a maximum dose of 43 E / kg / h .
in some patients with severe M@@ PS @-@ I@@ - un@@ conditional involvement of the upper respiratory tract and lungs in the pre@@ history , however , severe reactions occ@@ ured , including bron@@ ch@@ osp@@ as@@ m , res@@ piration and facial ede@@ ma .
very common ( occurrence of more than 1 out of 10 patients ) : • Head@@ ache • nausea • abdominal pain • rash • joint disease , joint pain , back pain , pain in the arms and legs • increased pulse • hyper@@ tension • less oxygen in the blood • Re@@ action to the in@@ fusion site

A@@ lim@@ ta is used together with C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin ( another drug for cancer ) in patients who have not yet received chemotherapy ( medicine against cancer ) and &quot; mal@@ ign@@ ant &quot; ( mal@@ ign@@ ant - cancer has already spread to other parts of the body ) or is likely to easily spread to other parts of the body ) .
A@@ lim@@ ta is used in patients who have not previously been treated in combination with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin and in patients who have previously received other chemotherapy regim@@ ens .
to reduce side effects , patients should take a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oid as well as fo@@ lic acid ( a vitamin ) during treatment with A@@ lim@@ ta and receive injec@@ tions of vitamin B@@ 12 .
if A@@ lim@@ ta is administered together with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin , a &quot; anti @-@ drug &quot; ( medicine against vom@@ iting ) and liquids ( in order to prevent liquid deficiency ) should be given before or after the application of c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin .
in patients whose blood pattern changes or if certain other side effects occur , the treatment should be postpon@@ ed , removed or the dose should be reduced .
the active form of P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ x@@ ed thus slo@@ ws down the formation of DNA and RNA and prevents the cells from sharing .
the transformation of P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ x@@ ed into its active form occurs more easily in cancer cells than in healthy cells , leading to higher concentrations of active form of the drug and a longer active duration in cancer cells .
for the treatment of the mal@@ ign@@ ant ple@@ ural tube , A@@ lim@@ ta was examined in a major study of 4@@ 56 patients who had previously received no chemotherapy against their disease .
in the treatment of non @-@ small cell lung cancer , the effects of A@@ lim@@ ta in 5@@ 71 patients with locally advanced or metastatic disease , previously treated with chemotherapy , were compared with the effects of doc@@ et@@ ax@@ el ( another drug against cancer ) .
A@@ lim@@ ta was also compared with gem@@ cit@@ ab@@ ine ( another drug against cancer ) , both in combination with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin in a study of 1,@@ 7@@ 25 patients who had previously received no chemotherapy for lung cancer .
patients treated with A@@ lim@@ ta and C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin survived an average of 12.@@ 1 months compared with 9.@@ 3 months in the sole administration of c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin .
in patients who had previously received chemotherapy , the average survival time with A@@ lim@@ ta was 8.3 months , compared with 7.@@ 9 months for doc@@ et@@ ax@@ el .
in both studies , however , patients in which the cancer did not attack the squ@@ am@@ ous epithel@@ ium cells were referred to as a comparison medication during the administration of A@@ lim@@ ta .
in September 2004 , the European Commission granted a permit to the company Eli Lil@@ ly Neder@@ land B.@@ V. to transport A@@ lim@@ ta to the European Union .
each screw bottle must be dissolved with 4.2 m@@ L 0,@@ 9 % sodium chlori@@ de injection solution ( 9 mg / ml ) , which results in a solution of 25 mg / ml .
the corresponding volume of the necessary doses is taken from the water bottle and dil@@ uted with 0,@@ 9 % sodium chlori@@ de injection solution ( 9 mg / ml ) to 100 m@@ L ( see section 6.@@ 6 ) .
ALI@@ M@@ TA is shown in combination with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin for first @-@ line treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic non @-@ single @-@ cell@@ ed bron@@ chi@@ al car@@ cin@@ oma ( see Section 5.1 ) .
ALI@@ M@@ TA in mon@@ otherapy is indicated for treatment in second @-@ line treatment of patients with Lo@@ - K@@ al advanced or metastatic non @-@ single @-@ cell@@ ed bron@@ chi@@ al car@@ cin@@ oma ( see Section 5.1 ) .
the recommended dose of ALI@@ M@@ TA 500 mg / m ² body surface ( K@@ OF ) is administered as intra@@ ven@@ ous in@@ fusion for a period of 10 minutes on the first day of every 21 day treatment cycle .
the recommended dose of c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin is 75 mg / m ² of CH@@ OF as in@@ fusion over a period of 2 hours about 30 minutes after completion of the P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ x@@ ed@@ - in@@ fusion on the first day every 21 day treatment cycle .
in patients with non @-@ small cell lung cancer after previous chemotherapy , the recommended dose of ALI@@ M@@ TA is 500 mg / m ² . intra@@ ven@@ ous in@@ fusion lasts about 10 minutes on the first day of every 21 @-@ day treatment cycle .
in order to reduce the frequency and sever@@ ity of skin reactions , a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oid must be given the day before and on the day of the P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ x@@ ed administration and the day after the treatment .
during the seven days before the first dose of P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ x@@ ed , at least 5 doses of fo@@ lic acid must be taken and the intake needs to be continued throughout the treatment period as well as for another 21 days after the last P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ x@@ ed@@ - dose .
patients must also receive intra@@ muscular injection of vitamin B@@ 12 ( 1000 mc@@ g ) a week before the first P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ x@@ ed dose and after each third treatment cycle .
in patients receiving P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ x@@ ed , a complete blood image should be created before each gift , including differentiation of leu@@ ko@@ cytes and thro@@ m@@ bo@@ cy@@ te counting .
alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase ( AP ) , as@@ part@@ ate trans@@ amin@@ ase ( AST or S@@ GO@@ T ) and alan@@ ine trans@@ amin@@ ase ( AL@@ T or S@@ G@@ PT ) should be ≤ 3 times the upper limit value .
at the beginning of a new treatment cycle , a dose check must take place considering the presence of the N@@ adi@@ r blood vessel or the maximum non @-@ ha@@ em@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity of the previous treatment cycles .
after the recovery , patients have to be treated according to the indications in tables 1 , 2 and 3 , which are used for ALI@@ M@@ TA as a mon@@ otherapy or in combination with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin .
these criteria correspond to the definition of the National Cancer Institute Common Tox@@ ic@@ ity C@@ riteri@@ a ( C@@ TC v@@ 2.0 ; N@@ CI 1998 ) ≥ C@@ TC degree 2 bleeding .
if patients do not develop ha@@ em@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity ≥ grade 3 ( except neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity ) , the therapy with ALI@@ M@@ TA must be interrupted before the patient under@@ takes the value before treatment
treatment with ALI@@ M@@ TA must be ab@@ orted if in patients after 2 dose reduction agents a hem@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity or non @-@ hem@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity level 3 or 4 occurs or so@@ - in the occurrence of grade 3 or 4 neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity .
clinical studies have no indication that in patients aged 65 years or over , there is an increased inci@@ dental risk in patients aged 65 years .
ALI@@ M@@ TA is not recommended for use in children under 18 years of age due to insufficient data on safety and efficacy .
in clinical trials , no dose adjustments were necessary in patients with a ker@@ at@@ in@@ ine clearance of ≥ 45 ml / min , exceeding the dose adjustments recommended for all patients .
the data situation in patients with a cre@@ at@@ in@@ in clearance of less than 45 ml / min was not sufficient ; therefore the application is not recommended ( see section 4.4 ) .
however , patients with a liver function restriction of &gt; 1.5 times the upper bili@@ ru@@ bin limit and / or trans@@ amin@@ ase values of &gt; 3.0 times the upper limit value ( in the absence of liver metast@@ ases ) or &gt; 5.0 @-@ fold of the upper limit value ( in the presence of liver metast@@ ases ) are not specifically studied in the studies .
patients must be supervised and P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ x@@ ed must not be administered to patients before their absolute neut@@ ro@@ ph@@ ils reg@@ ain a value of ≥ 1500 cells / mm ³ and the thro@@ m@@ bo@@ - cy@@ te value has again reached a value of ≥ 100,000 cells / mm ³ .
a dose reduction for further cycles is based on the N@@ adi@@ r of absolute neut@@ ro@@ ph@@ ils , thro@@ m@@ bo@@ cy@@ te and maximum non @-@ hem@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity , as observed in previous cycles of treatment ( see section 4.2 ) .
a lower toxic@@ ity and a reduction in grade 3 / 4 hem@@ at@@ ological and non @-@ hem@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity such as neut@@ ro@@ pen@@ ia , f@@ eb@@ r@@ ile neut@@ ro@@ pen@@ ia and infection with grade 3 / 4 neut@@ ro@@ pen@@ ia was observed when a pre@@ treatment with fo@@ lic acid and vitamin B@@ 12 had taken place .
therefore , all patients treated with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ x@@ ed need to use fo@@ lic acid and vitamin B@@ 12 as a pro@@ phy@@ lac@@ tic measure to reduce treatment @-@ related toxic@@ ity ( see section 4.2 ) .
patients with mild to medium ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in Clear@@ ance 45 to 79 ml / min ) must avoid the simultaneous consumption of non@@ ster@@ oi@@ dal anti@@ ph@@ rology ( &gt; 1.3 g daily ) for at least 2 days before the therapy , the day of therapy and at least 2 days after the therapy with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ x@@ ed ( see Section 4.5 ) .
all patients with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ x@@ ed therapy have to avoid taking N@@ SA@@ I@@ Ds with a long half @-@ life time for at least 5 days before the therapy , the day of the therapy and at least 2 days after the therapy with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ x@@ ed ( see Section 4.5 ) .
many patients in which these events occurred had corresponding risk factors for the occurrence of ren@@ al events , including dehy@@ dra@@ tion , pre @-@ existing hyper@@ tension or diabetes .
for this reason , a drainage of the eff@@ usion prior to P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ x@@ ed treatment should be induced in patients with clin@@ ically significant fluid retention in the trans@@ genic space .
5 serious cardiovascular events , including m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction , and cereb@@ rov@@ ascular events were occasionally reported in clinical studies with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ x@@ ed when this substance was usually administered in combination with another cy@@ tot@@ ox@@ ic substance .
for this reason , the simultaneous application of atten@@ u@@ ated live atten@@ u@@ ants ( except yellow fever , this vacc@@ ination is contra@@ indicated ) is not recommended ( see Section 4.3 and 4.5 ) .
since the possibility of ir@@ reversible expansion of the reproductive ability by P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ x@@ ed , men should be advised of the treatment instructions to obtain advice regarding sperm conservation .
in patients with normal ren@@ al function ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in Clear@@ ance ≥ 80 ml / min ) , high doses of non@@ ster@@ oi@@ dal anti@@ ph@@ rology ( N@@ SA@@ I@@ Ds , like i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen &gt; 1600 mg / day ) and acet@@ yl@@ sal@@ icy@@ lic acid can lead to reduced P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ x@@ ed elimination with the result of an increased occurrence of side effects .
caution is advised if high doses of N@@ SA@@ I@@ Ds or A@@ ce@@ - t@@ yl@@ sal@@ icy@@ lic acid in patients with normal kidney function ( cre@@ at@@ in@@ in Clear@@ ance ≥ 80 ml / min ) are used in high doses .
i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen ) or acet@@ yl@@ sal@@ icy@@ lic acid in high dosage for at least 2 days prior to therapy , be avoided on day of therapy and at least 2 days after therapy with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ x@@ ed ( see section 4.4 ) .
since no data regarding the interaction potential with N@@ SA@@ I@@ Ds with long half @-@ time such as Pi@@ ro@@ - x@@ ic@@ am or ro@@ fec@@ oxi@@ b are available , the simultaneous use with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ x@@ ed must be avoided for at least 5 days before the therapy , the day of the therapy and at least 2 days after the therapy with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ x@@ ed .
the large in@@ tra @-@ individual vari@@ ability of co@@ ag@@ ulation status during the disease and the possibility of interactions between oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants and ant@@ ine@@ oplas@@ tic chemotherapy require an increased monitoring frequency of IN@@ R ( International Norm@@ alised R@@ atio ) when the decision was made to treat the patient with oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants .
there are no data for the use of P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ x@@ ed in pregnant women , but as with anti @-@ inflammatory an@@ tim@@ etab@@ ol@@ ites severe birth defects are expected during an application during pregnancy .
P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ x@@ ed must not be used during pregnancy unless necessary and after careful consideration of the benefits for the mother and the risk for the fo@@ etus ( see section 4.4 ) .
since the possibility of ir@@ reversible damage to the reproductive ability by P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ x@@ ed , men should be advised before the commen@@ cement of treatment to obtain advice regarding the sperm production .
it is not known whether P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ x@@ ed passes into breast milk and unwanted effects in the breast@@ fed baby can not be excluded .
the following table shows the frequency and sever@@ ity of adverse events reported in &gt; 5 % of 168 patients with mes@@ othel@@ i@@ oma and which were random@@ ised to C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin and P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ x@@ ed as well as 163 patients with mes@@ othel@@ i@@ oma who were random@@ ised to c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin as mon@@ otherapy .
common adverse reactions : very common ( ≥ 1 / 100 and &lt; 1 / 10 ) , occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 and &lt; 1 / 1000 ) , rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 and &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) , very rare ( &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) and not known ( on the basis of available data of spontaneous statements cannot be estimated ) .

clin@@ ically relevant toxic@@ ity grade 3 and 4 was similar to Phase 2 of three individual P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ x@@ ed Mon@@ otherapy stages ( n = 164 ) , excluding neut@@ ro@@ pen@@ ia ( 12.@@ 8 % compared to 5.3 % ) and an increase in alan@@ ine trans@@ amin@@ ase ( 15.@@ 2 % compared to 1.9 % ) .
these differences are likely to be attributed to differences in the patient population as the P@@ ha@@ - se 2 studies included both chem@@ on@@ ai@@ ve and clearly pre @-@ treated breast cancer patients with existing liver metast@@ ases and / or abnormal initial values of liver function tests .
the following table shows the incidence and sever@@ ity of adverse effects that could be related to study medi@@ ation ; they were reported to &gt; 5 % of 8@@ 39 patients with N@@ SC@@ LC who received random@@ ised c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin and P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ x@@ ed and 830 patients with N@@ SC@@ LC who were random@@ ised to c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin and gem@@ cit@@ ab@@ ine .

clinical studies have occasionally reported cases of co@@ li@@ tis ( including intestinal and rec@@ tal bleeding , sometimes fatal , intestinal per@@ fo@@ x@@ ration , intestinal nec@@ ro@@ sis , and ty@@ ph@@ li@@ tis ) in patients with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ x@@ ed .
in clinical trials patients with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ x@@ ed occasionally reported cases of sometimes fatal inter@@ sti@@ tial pneum@@ oni@@ tis with respiratory failure .
cases of acute ren@@ al failure in P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ x@@ ed mon@@ otherapy or in combination with other chem@@ otherapeu@@ tics have been reported ( see section 4.4 ) .
cases of radiation pneum@@ oni@@ tis were reported in patients who were treated before , during or after their P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ x@@ ed therapy ( see section 4.4 ) .
ALI@@ M@@ TA ( P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ x@@ ed ) is an ant@@ ine@@ oplas@@ tic anti@@ fung@@ al that ex@@ poses its effect by interrup@@ ting the metabolic processes necessary for cell rep@@ lication .
in vitro studies showed that P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ x@@ ed works as an anti@@ de@@ ath@@ ic with several attack points by blocking the thy@@ me lat@@ ency ( TS ) , D@@ ih@@ y@@ dro@@ fol@@ ate reduc@@ t@@ ase ( DH@@ FR ) , and Gly@@ c@@ amid@@ ri@@ bon@@ u@@ cle@@ ot@@ id@@ for@@ - m@@ yl@@ transfer@@ ase ( GAR@@ FT ) , the fol@@ ate @-@ dependent key enzymes of the de nov@@ o bi@@ os@@ yn@@ thesis of thy@@ mid@@ in- and Pur@@ im watches .
EMP@@ H@@ AC@@ IS , a multic@@ ent@@ re , random@@ ised , simple @-@ blind phase 3 study by ALI@@ M@@ TA plus c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin against c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin with mal@@ ign@@ ant ple@@ ural ur@@ othel@@ i@@ oma showed that patients treated with ALI@@ M@@ TA and C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin had a clin@@ ically significant benefit of survival compared to those patients who were treated only with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin .
the primary analysis of this study was carried out in the population of all patients receiving test medication in the treatment arm ( random@@ ised and treated ) .
a statisti@@ cally significant improvement of the clin@@ ically relevant symptoms ( pain and dy@@ sp@@ nea ) related to the mal@@ ign@@ ant ple@@ ural therapy was shown in the ALI@@ M@@ TA / C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin arm ( 212 patients ) compared to the exclusive C@@ is@@ pl@@ a- tin @-@ arm ( 218 patients ) .
the differences between the two treatment arms showed an improvement in the pul@@ mon@@ ary function parameters in the ALI@@ M@@ TA / C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin arm and the deteri@@ oration of lung function over time .
a multic@@ enter , random@@ ised , open phase III trial with ALI@@ M@@ TA against doc@@ et@@ ax@@ el in patients with locally advanced or metastatic N@@ SC@@ LC after previous chemotherapy used patients treated with ALI@@ M@@ TA ( extent to treat population n = 28@@ 3 ) and from 7.@@ 9 months in patients treated with doc@@ et@@ ax@@ el ( IT@@ T n = 288 ) .
an analysis of the influence of hist@@ ology on overall survival fell in favor of ALI@@ M@@ TA in patients with N@@ SC@@ LC with a predominantly un@@ printed epithel@@ ial hist@@ ological type ( n = 3@@ 99 , 9.@@ 3 versus 7.@@ 4 months , adjusted HR = 1.@@ 56 ; 95 % CI = 1,@@ 08 @-@ 2,@@ 26 , p = 0,@@ 018 ) .
limited data of a separately random@@ ised , controlled phase 3 study showed efficacy data ( survival and progression @-@ free survival ) for P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ x@@ ed between patients with ( n = 41 ) and without ( n = 540 ) pre@@ treatment by doc@@ et@@ ax@@ el .
the efficacy analyses of the P@@ Q population are consistent with the analyses of the IT@@ T population and support the non @-@ su@@ pre@@ m@@ acy of ALI@@ M@@ TA C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin in combination with gem@@ cit@@ ab@@ ine c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin combination .
mean P@@ FS was 4.8 months for the combination of ALI@@ M@@ TA c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin versus 5,@@ 1 months for combination gem@@ cit@@ ab@@ ine c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin ( adjusted HR = 1.@@ 04 ; 95 % CI = 0.@@ 94 - 1.@@ 15 ) , the overall response rate was 28.@@ 2 % ( 95 % CI = 25.@@ 0 - 3@@ 1,4 ) for combination gem@@ cit@@ ab@@ ine c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin .
the analysis of the influence of N@@ SC@@ LC history on survival showed clin@@ ically relevant differences according to hist@@ ology , see table below .
CI = confidence interval ; IT@@ T = intent @-@ to @-@ treat ; N = size of the total population a statisti@@ cally significant for non @-@ su@@ pre@@ m@@ acy , with a total confidence interval for HR ( = Haz@@ ard ratio ) clearly below the non @-@ probability limit of 1,@@ 17@@ 6@@ 45 ( p &lt; 0.0@@ 01 ) .
patients treated with ALI@@ M@@ TA and C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin needed less trans@@ f@@ usions ( 16.@@ 4 % versus 28.@@ 9 % , p &lt; 0.0@@ 01 ) , er@@ y@@ thro@@ cy@@ te transp@@ oses ( 16.@@ 1 % versus 27.@@ 3 % , p &lt; 0.0@@ 01 ) and thro@@ m@@ bo@@ cy@@ te transactions ( 1.8 % versus 4.5 % , p = 0.0@@ 02 ) .
in addition , the patients needed the administration of er@@ y@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin / D@@ arb@@ op@@ o@@ e@@ tin ( 10.@@ 4 % versus 18.@@ 1 % , p &lt; 0.0@@ 01 ) , G @-@ CS@@ F / GM @-@ CS@@ F ( 3.1 % versus 6.8 % , p = 0.0@@ 04 ) , and iron preparations ( 4,@@ 3 % versus 7.0 % , p = 0.0@@ 21 ) .
the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic properties of P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ x@@ ed as a mon@@ otherap@@ ist were examined for 4@@ 26 cancer patients with various solid tum@@ ours in doses ranging from 0.2 to 8@@ 38 mg / m ² in inf@@ usions over a period of 10 minutes .
P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ x@@ ed is mainly ex@@ cre@@ ted in the urine and 70 % to 90 % of the administered dose will be found in the urine within 24 hours following the application .
P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ x@@ ed has a total total of 9@@ 1.8 ml / min and half @-@ life in plasma is 3,5 hours in patients with normal ren@@ al fun@@ tion ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in Clear@@ ance 90 ml / min ) .
in a study involving be@@ agle dogs obtained for 9 months intra@@ ven@@ ous Bol@@ us injec@@ tions , Tes@@ tic@@ ular changes were observed ( De@@ gen@@ e- ration / nec@@ ro@@ sis of the sem@@ ini@@ fer@@ ous epithel@@ ial tissue ) .
unless otherwise applied , the retention times and conditions after preparation are not exceeding the responsibility of the user and should not exceed 24 hours at 2 to 8 ° C unless the preparation / di@@ lution has taken place under controlled and vali@@ dated as@@ ep@@ tic conditions .
dissolve the contents of the 100 mg vial bottles with 4.2 ml 0.9 % natural sodium chlori@@ de ( 9 mg / ml ) without any preserv@@ atives , resulting in a solution with a concentration of about 25 mg / ml P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ x@@ ed .
the resulting solution is clear and the col@@ oring ranges from colour@@ less to yellow or green@@ ish without affecting product quality .
each screw bottle must be dissolved with 20 ml 0.9 % sodium chlori@@ de injection solution ( 9 mg / ml ) , which results in a solution of 25 mg / ml .
23 serious cardiovascular events , including m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction , and cereb@@ rov@@ ascular events were occasionally reported in clinical studies with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ x@@ ed when this substance was usually administered in combination with another cy@@ tot@@ ox@@ ic substance .

the resulting solution is clear and the col@@ oring ranges from colour@@ less to yellow or green@@ ish without compromising the product quality .
it is used in obes@@ e adults with a body mass index ( BM@@ I ) ≥ 28 kg per square metre in combination with a low @-@ cal@@ orie , low @-@ fat diet .
patients who take All@@ i and do not have weight loss after 12 weeks should contact their doctor or pharmac@@ ist .
if these enzymes are inhi@@ bited , they cannot break down some fats in the food , causing around a quarter of the fats , which are fed into the food , uns@@ ec@@ ured the intest@@ ines .
in a third study , All@@ i was compared to plac@@ ebo by 3@@ 91 obes@@ e patients with a BM@@ I between 25 and 28 kg / m2 .
in both studies in patients with a BM@@ I of ≥ 28 kg / m2 patients who took All@@ i 60 mg had an average weight loss of 4.8 kg , compared to 2.3 kg in taking plac@@ ebo .
in the study with All@@ i in patients with BM@@ I between 25 and 28 kg / m2 , no weight loss could be observed for patients .
the most common side effects of All@@ i ( observed in more than 1 out of 10 patients ) are o@@ ily spots on after , fl@@ atus ( win@@ ch ) with fa@@ eces , stu@@ h@@ ld@@ iness , o@@ ily / o@@ ily chair , leaving o@@ ily secre@@ tion ( knot@@ s ) , flat@@ ul@@ ence ( win@@ ch ) and soft chairs .
it should not be used in patients who are treated with C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( to prevent organ rejection in transplan@@ t patients ) or with medicines such as war@@ far@@ in to prevent blood cl@@ ots .
it may also not be used in patients suffering from long @-@ term mal@@ absorption syndrome ( in which not enough nutrients are absorbed from the digestive tract ) or from chol@@ est@@ ase ( liver disease ) , and in pregnant women or nursing mothers .
in July 2007 , the European Commission granted Gla@@ x@@ o Group Limited an approval for the placing of Or@@ li@@ stat GS@@ K in the entire European Union .
all@@ i is indicated for weight reduction in adults with over@@ weight ( Body Mass Index BM@@ I ≥ 28 kg / m2 ) and should be used in conjunction with a slightly hypo@@ kal@@ ini@@ ori , low @-@ fat diet .
all@@ i should not be used by children and adolescents under 18 because there is not enough data for efficacy and safety .
since or@@ li@@ stat is only minim@@ ally res@@ or@@ bed , it is not necessary to adjust the dosage in older patients and in patients with reduced liver and / or kidney function .
• hyper@@ sensitivity to the active ingredient or any of the other ingredients • Sim@@ ult@@ aneous treatment with C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( see Section 4.5 ) • Chr@@ onic col@@ oration syndrome • chol@@ est@@ ase • P@@ reg@@ n@@ ancy ( see Section 4.6 ) • Sim@@ ult@@ aneous treatment with war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants ( see sections 4.5 and 4.8 )
the lik@@ eli@@ hood of occurrence of g@@ astro@@ intestinal symptoms ( see paragraph 4.8 ) can increase if all@@ i is taken together with a fat @-@ rich single meal or fat @-@ rich diet .
as the weight reduction in diabetes can be accompanied by improved metabolic control , patients who take a medicine against diabetes should consult a doctor or pharmac@@ ist before starting treatment with all@@ i because the dosage of the anti@@ di@@ ab@@ etic needs to be adjusted .
patients who take all@@ i as well as medicines for high blood pressure or elevated cholesterol should consult their doctor or pharmac@@ ist if the dosage of these medicines has to be adapted .
it is recommended to take additional contra@@ cep@@ tive measures to prevent the potential failure of oral contra@@ c@@ eption in case of severe diarr@@ ho@@ ea ( see Section 4.5 ) .
in a study on drug interactions as well as in several cases with the simultaneous use of or@@ li@@ stat and C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in , a lowering of the C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in plasma levels was observed .
in the application of war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants in combination with or@@ li@@ stat , the Quick @-@ Val@@ ues ( internationally standar@@ dised ratio , IN@@ R ) could be influenced ( see section 4.8 ) .
in most patients who were treated with or@@ li@@ stat in clinical trials up to 4 full years , concentrations of vitamins A , D , E and K as well as beta carot@@ enes remained in the normal range .
however , patients should be advised to take supplements of mul@@ tiv@@ it@@ amin supplements before bed@@ time to ensure adequate vitamin absorption ( see section 4.4 ) .
after the administration of a single @-@ dose A@@ mi@@ o@@ dar@@ one , a minor decrease in the A@@ mi@@ o@@ dar@@ one plasma concentration was observed in a limited number of healthy volunteers who received or@@ li@@ stat at the same time .
experimental studies showed no direct or indirect harmful effects on pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , birth or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see Section 5.3 ) .
the side effects of or@@ li@@ stat are mainly g@@ astro@@ intestinal nature and are related to the pharmac@@ ological effect of the drug as the absorption of absorbed fat is prevented .
g@@ astro@@ intestinal effects were obtained from clinical trials with or@@ li@@ stat 60 mg over a period of 18 months to 2 years and were generally mild and temporary .
the frequencies are defined as follows : very common ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) , occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) , rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 , &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) and very rare ( &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) , not known ( frequency based on available data cannot be estimated ) .
the incidence of adverse events detected after the market launch of or@@ li@@ stat is unknown since these events were voluntarily reported by a population of unknown magnitude .
† It is plau@@ sible that the treatment with all@@ i can lead to anxiety regarding possible and actual g@@ astro@@ intestinal side effects .
single doses of 800 mg of or@@ li@@ stat and multiple doses of up to 400 mg three times a day were administered to normal and over@@ weight subjects over a period of 15 days without significant clinical findings .
in the majority of reported cases of or@@ li@@ stat over@@ dosing , either side effects or similar side effects were reported as at the recommended dose of or@@ li@@ stat .
based on studies on humans and animals , a rapid recovery of any system@@ ic effects that can be attributed to the li@@ pas@@ ating properties of or@@ li@@ stat can be assumed .
the therapeutic effect is used in the l@@ umen of the stomach and the upper small intest@@ ine by co@@ valent bonding to the active ser@@ ine @-@ rest of the ga@@ str@@ ic and pancre@@ atic lip@@ ases .
from clinical studies it was derived that 60 mg of or@@ li@@ stat , taken three times a day , blocks absorption of about 25 % of the food fat .
two double @-@ blind , random@@ ised , plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled studies in adults with a BM@@ I ≥ 28 kg / m2 substanti@@ ate the efficacy of 60 mg or@@ li@@ stat , which was taken three times daily in combination with a hypo@@ kal@@ ini@@ al , low @-@ fat diet .
the primary parameter , the change in body weight compared to the initial value ( at the time of random@@ isation ) , was evaluated as follows : as a change in body weight in the course of study ( Table 1 ) and as a proportion of those participating in study which have lost more than 5 % or more than 10 % of their initial weight ( Table 2 ) .
although weight reduction was observed over 12 months in both trials , the greatest weight loss occurred in the first 6 months .
the average change in total cholesterol was 60 mg -@@ 2.4 % ( initial value 5.@@ 20 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and plac@@ ebo + 2.8 % ( initial value 5.@@ 26 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
the average change of L@@ DL cholesterol was 60 mg -@@ 3.5 % ( initial value 3.@@ 30 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and plac@@ ebo + 3.8 % ( initial value 3.@@ 41 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
at the waist circum@@ ference , the mean change was -@@ 4.5 cm with or@@ li@@ stat 60 mg ( initial value 10@@ 3.7 cm ) and with plac@@ ebo -@@ 3,6 cm ( initial value 10@@ 3,5 cm ) .
plasma concentrations of non @-@ met@@ aboli@@ zed or@@ li@@ stat were not measur@@ able 8 hours after the oral administration of 360 mg of or@@ li@@ stat ( &lt; 5 n@@ g / ml ) .

all@@ i is used for weight reduction and is applied in obes@@ e adults over 18 years with a Body Mass Index ( BM@@ I ) of 28 or above . all@@ i should be used in conjunction with a low @-@ fat and low @-@ cal@@ orie diet .
the BM@@ I helps you determine whether you have a normal weight in relation to your height or are over@@ weight .
even if these diseases do not cause you to feel uncomfortable , you should consult your doctor for a control examination .
for 2 kg of body weight , which you take as part of a diet , you can lose an additional kilogra@@ m with the help of all@@ i .
please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you take other medicines or have taken it until recently , even if it is not prescription medicine .
C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in is used after organ transplan@@ ts , in severe rheumat@@ oid arthritis and certain severe skin diseases . • War@@ far@@ in or other medicines which have a blood th@@ inning effect .
oral contra@@ cep@@ tive contra@@ cep@@ tive and all@@ i • The effect of oral @-@ increasing means of contra@@ c@@ eption ( pill ) is under certain circumstances weak@@ ened or lifted if you have severe diarr@@ ho@@ ea ( diarr@@ hea ) .
before taking all@@ i to your doctor or pharmac@@ ist , please contact your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you take : • A@@ mi@@ o@@ dar@@ one to treat heart rhythm disorders .
ask your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you take all@@ i and • if you take medicines for high blood pressure , as possibly the dosage needs to be adjusted .
for more helpful information on the blue pages in section 6 , you can find out how you can define your cal@@ ory and fet@@ al limits .
if you leave a meal or have a meal no fat , take no capsule . all@@ i can only work if the food contains fat .
if you take the capsule in conjunction with a meal that contains too much fat , you risk nutritional defici@@ encies ( see paragraph 4 ) .
in order to accust@@ om your body to the new eating habits , start before the first capsule intake with a cal@@ orie and low @-@ fat diet .
food di@@ aries are effective as you can understand what you eat at any time , what you eat , how much you eat and it will likely be easier to change your eating habits .
in order to achieve your goal weight , you should define two daily targets in advance : one for the calories and one for fat .
• You may eat gre@@ asy to reduce the lik@@ eli@@ hood of nutritional supplements ( see paragraph 4 ) . • T@@ ry to move more before you start taking the capsules .
remember to ask your doctor in advance if you are not accust@@ omed to physical activity . • St@@ ay while taking and also after taking all@@ i physically active .
• all@@ i should not be taken for more than 6 months . • If you cannot find a reduction in weight after 12 weeks of application of all@@ i , ask your doctor or pharmac@@ ist for advice .
you may need to stop taking all@@ i . • In case of successful weight loss , it is not a matter of replacing the diet in the short term and then returning to the old habits .
• If less than one hour has passed since the last meal , take the intake of the capsule . • If more than one hour has passed since the last meal , take no capsule .
flat@@ ul@@ ence with and without o@@ ede@@ ma ( sudden or increased stu@@ h@@ ld@@ iness and soft chair ) can be attributed to the mechanism of action ( see section 1 ) .
severe allergic reactions • severe allergic reactions can be seen in the following changes : severe breathing difficulties , swe@@ ats , skin rash , it@@ ching , swelling of the face , heart disease , circul@@ atory collapse .

please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if any of the listed side effects may significantly affect you or notice side effects that are not indicated in this use information .
the most common side effects are related to the effect of the capsules and result in increased fat from the body .
these side effects usually occur within the first weeks of treatment , as you may have not consistently reduced the fat percentage in your diet .
with the following basic rules , you can learn to minimize nutritional considerations : • Beg@@ in already several days , or better a week before taking the capsules with a low @-@ fat diet . • Learn more about the usual fat content of your favorite foods and about the size of the serv@@ ings that you normally take .
if you know exactly how much you eat , the lik@@ eli@@ hood of seeing your fat limit decreases . • Distri@@ bute your recommended amount of fat evenly to daily meals .
save the amount of calories and fat you may take per meal , not to take them in the form of a fat rich main dish or a substantial dessert , as you might have done in other programs for weight reduction .
• Ke@@ ep out of reach of children . • Do not use the ex@@ piration date indicated on the carton . • Ke@@ ep container ti@@ ghtly closed to protect the contents from moisture . • The bottle contains two white sealed containers with Si@@ lic@@ a@@ gel that serve to keep the capsules dry .
do not swal@@ low them . • You can take your daily dose all@@ i in the blue cargo box ( shuttle ) which is included in this package .

obesity has an influence on your health and increases the risk of developing various serious diseases such as : • high blood pressure • diabetes • heart disease • stroke • Cer@@ tain canc@@ ers • O@@ ste@@ o@@ arthritis Please talk to your doctor about your risk of these diseases .
permanent weight loss , for example by improving diet and more exercise , can prevent serious illness and has a positive impact on your health .
choose meals that contain a wide range of nutrients and gradually learn to eat health@@ ily .
energy is also measured in kil@@ o@@ j@@ ou@@ les which you also find as an indication of the food packaging . • The recommended cal@@ orie intake indicates how many calories you should consume at a maximum per day .
keep in mind the tables below . • The recommended fat intake in grams is the maximum amount of fat you should take with each meal .
please refer to the information below that indicates the number of calories suitable for you . • Because of the mode of action of the capsule , compliance with the recommended fat intake is crucial .
if you take the same amount of fat as before , this may mean that your body cannot process this amount of fat .
by adher@@ ing to the recommended fat intake , you can maxim@@ ize weight loss and at the same time reduce the lik@@ eli@@ hood of nutritional supplements . • You should try to gradually lose weight .
34 This reduced cal@@ orie intake should allow you to lose weight gradually and continuously about 0.5 kilogra@@ mm@@ es a week without developing fru@@ strations and dis@@ appointments .
the more active you are , the higher your recommended cal@@ orie intake . • &quot; Low physical activity &quot; means that you daily work little or no longer , climbing stairs , working in the garden or doing other physical activities . • &quot; Medium physical activity &quot; means that you can burn 150 kcal per day , e.g. by 3 km walking , 30@@ - to 45 @-@ minute gar@@ dening or 2 km walk in 15 minutes .
• For permanent weight loss , it is necessary to set realistic cal@@ orie and fat targets and to keep them . • Sen@@ su@@ ous is a nutritional diary with information on the cal@@ orie and fat content of your meals . • T@@ ry to move more before you start taking all@@ i .
the all@@ i program to support weight loss combines the capsules with a diet plan and a large number of other information materials that can help you feed cal@@ orie and fat @-@ duc@@ ts and give guidelines to become more physically active .
in combination with a program tailored to your type to support weight loss , this information can help you develop a health@@ ier lifestyle and achieve your target weight .
Alo@@ is is used in chem@@ otherap@@ ies which are a strong trigger for nausea and vom@@ iting ( such as c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin ) , as well as in chem@@ otherap@@ ies , the regular trigger for nausea and vom@@ iting ( such as cy@@ clo@@ phosph@@ amide , do@@ x@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ in or carb@@ op@@ l@@ atin ) .
the efficacy of Alo@@ xi can be increased by adding a Cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oid ( a drug that can be used as an anti@@ em@@ e@@ tic ) .
the application for patients under 18 years of age is not recommended , as there is not enough information about the effects in this age group .
this means that the active agent prevents the binding of a chemical substance in the body , 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amin ( 5@@ HT , also known as ser@@ oton@@ in ) , to the recept@@ ors in the intest@@ ines .
in three main studies Alo@@ is examined 1 8@@ 42 adults who received chem@@ otherap@@ ies , which are strong or moderate for nausea and vom@@ iting .
chem@@ otherap@@ ies , which are a strong trigger for nausea and vom@@ iting , showed 59 % of patients treated with al@@ al@@ ab@@ i in the 24 hours after chemotherapy not vom@@ iting ( 132 of 223 ) , compared to 57 % of patients treated with On@@ dan@@ set@@ ron ( 126 of 221 ) .
chemotherapy regim@@ ens , which are moderate for nausea and vom@@ iting , showed 81 % of patients treated with al@@ al@@ ab@@ i in 24 hours after chemotherapy ( 153 of 189 ) , compared to 69 % of patients treated with On@@ dan@@ set@@ ron ( 127 out of 185 ) .
in a comparison with Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron these values were 63 % for Alo@@ xi ( 119 of 189 patients ) and 53 % for Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron ( 101 out of 191 patients ) .
in March 2005 , the European Commission granted a permit to the company of Helsinki Bi@@ re@@ x Pharmaceu@@ ticals Ltd . , for the marketing of Alo@@ xi in the entire European Union .
Alo@@ is indicated : to prevent acute nausea and vom@@ iting in case of strong em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy as a result of canc@@ ers and to prevent nausea and vom@@ iting in moder@@ ately em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy as a result of cancer .
the efficacy of Alo@@ xi for the prevention of nausea and vom@@ iting induced by a strongly em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy can be increased by adding a Cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids given prior to chemotherapy .
since Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron can pro@@ long the col@@ on massage , patients with an@@ am@@ ne@@ sty ob@@ sti@@ p@@ ation or signs of sub@@ acute I@@ le@@ us should be closely monitored after injection .
as with other 5@@ HT@@ 3 antagon@@ ists , however , caution is advised with simultaneous administration of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron with medicines which extend the Q@@ T interval or tend to patients with which the Q@@ t interval is extended or which tend to be such an extension .
in addition to a further chemotherapy regim@@ en , al@@ al@@ um should not be used to prevent or treat nausea and vom@@ iting in the days following chemotherapy .
in pre@@ clinical studies , Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron inhi@@ bited the activity of the five chem@@ otherapeu@@ tics studied against tum@@ ours ( c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin , cy@@ clo@@ phosph@@ amide , cy@@ clo@@ ab@@ ine , do@@ x@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ in and Mit@@ om@@ y@@ cin C ) .
in a clinical study there was no significant pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic interaction between a single intra@@ ven@@ ous dose of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron and a ste@@ ady stat@@ e- concentration of oral met@@ oc@@ lo@@ pra@@ mi@@ ds , a CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 inhibit@@ or .
in a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic analysis based on a population was shown that the simultaneous administration of CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 @-@ In@@ hi@@ bit@@ ors ( A@@ mi@@ o@@ dar@@ one , C@@ elec@@ oxi@@ b , Chlor@@ pro@@ ma@@ zin , C@@ im@@ eti@@ dine , Do@@ x@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ in , Flu@@ ox@@ et@@ ine , Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol , R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r , Ser@@ tr@@ aline and Ter@@ bin@@ af@@ in ) had no significant effect on the Clear@@ ance of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron .
experiences concerning the use of pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron in human pregn@@ an@@ cies are not present , so Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron should not be used in pregnant women unless it is deemed necessary by the treating physician .
in clinical studies , the most common adverse events were observed in a dose of 250 micro@@ grams ( a total of 6@@ 33 patients ) , which at least were related to al@@ oh@@ a , head@@ aches ( 9 % ) and ob@@ sti@@ p@@ ation ( 5 % ) .
very rare cases ( &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) of hyper@@ sensitivity reactions and reactions at the location ( burning , har@@ dening , dis@@ comfort and pain ) were reported in post marketing reports .
in the group with the highest dosage there were similar frequencies of adverse events as in the other dosage groups ; there were no dose @-@ effect relationships observed .
no di@@ aly@@ sis studies were performed , but due to the large volume of distribution , di@@ aly@@ sis is presum@@ ably no effective therapy for al@@ op@@ al@@ op@@ last@@ y .
two random@@ ised double @-@ blind studies received a total of 1,@@ 132 patients who received a moder@@ ately em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy with ≤ 50 mg / m2 C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin , carb@@ op@@ l@@ atin , ≤ 1,500 mg / m2 do@@ x@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ in and 250 mc@@ g of pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron , given on Day 1 without dex@@ am@@ eth@@ as@@ one intra@@ ven@@ ously .
in a random@@ ised double @-@ blind study , a total of 6@@ 67 patients who received a highly em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy with ≥ 60 mg / m2@@ C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin , &gt; 1,500 mg / m2 cy@@ clo@@ phosph@@ amide , and 250 or 750 micro@@ grams Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron were compared with patients who received 32 mg On@@ dan@@ set@@ ron which were given intra@@ ven@@ ously on Day 1 .
results from studies with moder@@ ately em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy and a study of strongly em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy are summar@@ ised in the following tables .
in clinical trials for indication of chemotherapy @-@ induced nausea and vom@@ iting ( C@@ IN@@ V ) , the effects of pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron were comparable to blood pressure , heart rate and EC@@ G parameters including the Q@@ t@@ c interval with the corresponding effects of on@@ dan@@ set@@ ron and cone .
after the findings of pre @-@ clinical investigations , Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron has the ability to block the ion channels involved in vent@@ ri@@ cular de@@ - and rep@@ ol@@ ar@@ isation and pro@@ long the duration of the action potential .
the aim of the study carried out in 221 healthy volunteers was the assessment of the EC@@ G effects of i.@@ v. administered Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron in single doses of 0.25 , 0,75 and 2.@@ 25 mg .
absorption After intra@@ ven@@ ous administration follows an initial decrease in plasma concentrations a slow elimination of the body with an average terminal half @-@ life of about 40 hours .
the average maximum plasma concentration ( c@@ max ) and the area below the concentration time curve ( AU@@ C@@ 0@@ - ∞ ) are generally proportional in the entire dose range of 0.@@ 3- 90 μ g / kg in healthy and cancer patients .
after intra@@ ven@@ ous administration of pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron 0.25 mg every second day for a total of 3 doses , the mean mean ( ± SD ) increase of the Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron plasma concentration between day 1 and day 5 was 42 ± 34 % .
pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic simul@@ ations show that the intra@@ ven@@ ous intra@@ ven@@ ous administration of 0.25 mg Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron was comparable to 3 consecutive days after intra@@ ven@@ ous intra@@ ven@@ ous administration of 0.75 mg . however , the c@@ max was higher after an intra@@ ven@@ ous dose of 0.75 mg .
about 40 % are eliminated by the kid@@ neys and approximately another 50 % are converted into two primary metabol@@ ites , which in comparison to Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron have less than 1 % of the antagon@@ istic effect on the 5@@ HT@@ 3 recep@@ tor .
in @-@ vitro studies on metabolism have shown that CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 and CY@@ P@@ 1@@ A2 are involved in the metabolism of CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 and CY@@ P@@ 1@@ A2 on the metabolism of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron .
elimination After an intra@@ ven@@ ous single dose of 10 micro@@ grams / kg &#91; 14@@ C &#93; -@@ Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron approximately 80 % of the dose were found within 144 hours in the urine , Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron as an unchanged ingredient made approx . 40 % of the given dose .
after a one @-@ time intra@@ ven@@ ous bol@@ us injection in healthy eyes , the total body weight was 173 / 73 m@@ L / min and the ren@@ al clearance 53 ± 29 ml / min .
in patients with severe liver dysfunction , the terminal elimin@@ ator time and the average system@@ ic exposure to Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron are increased , but a reduction in dose is not justified .
in pre @-@ clinical studies effects were observed only after ex@@ positions which are considered sufficient above the maximum human therapeu@@ tical exposure , suggest@@ ing low relevance for clinical use .
10 From pre@@ clinical studies , evidence suggests that Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron can only block ion channels in very high concentrations which are involved in vent@@ ri@@ cular de@@ - and rep@@ ol@@ ar@@ isation and pro@@ long the duration of action .
high doses of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron ( each dose correspon@@ ded roughly twice the therapeutic exposure to humans ) , which were given daily for over two years resulted in increased frequency of liver tum@@ ours , endo@@ cr@@ ine ne@@ oplas@@ ms ( in thy@@ roid gland , p@@ itu@@ itary , pancre@@ as , adren@@ al mar@@ row ) and skin tum@@ ors in rats , but not in mice .
the underlying mechanisms are not fully known , but due to the high dos@@ ages used and since Alo@@ is is determined in humans for one @-@ time use , the relevance of these results is low to the human being .
the holder of this permit for placing on the market must inform the European Commission of the plans for placing the drug approved in the context of this decision .

in June 2006 , the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) adopted a negative opinion in which the approval of the marketing authorization for the treatment of hepatitis C was recommended 6 million IE / ml injection solution .
this means that al@@ ph@@ eon should resem@@ ble a biological medicinal product called Ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A with the same medicinal product that is already approved in the EU ( also called &quot; reference medicinal products &quot; ) .
al@@ ph@@ eon should be used to treat adult patients with chronic ( long @-@ lasting ) hepatitis C ( a liver disease caused by a viral infection ) .
in a microsc@@ opic examination the liver tissue damages damages , in addition , the values of the liver enzyme Alan@@ ine Amin@@ ot@@ ran@@ s@@ fer@@ ase ( AL@@ T ) in the blood @-@ standard are increased .
it is produced by a yeast in which a gene ( DNA ) has been inj@@ ected , which stimulates the formation of the active substance .
the manufacturer of Al@@ ph@@ eon presented data that demonstrate the comparison of Al@@ ph@@ eon with Ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A ( substance structure , composition and purity of the medicine , mode of action , safety and efficacy in hepatitis C ) .
in the study of patients with hepatitis C , the efficacy of Al@@ ph@@ eon was compared with the efficacy of the reference drug to 4@@ 55 patients .
the study measured how many patients after 12 of a total of 48 weeks of treatment and 6 months after the treatment was taken to the drug ( i.e. no signs of the virus reported in the blood ) .
74 18 84 00 Fax ( 44 @-@ 20 ) 74 18 84 16 E @-@ mail : mail @ em@@ e@@ a.@@ eu@@ .@@ int htt@@ p : / / www.@@ em@@ e@@ a.@@ eu@@ .@@ int © E@@ MEA 2006 Re@@ production and / or distribution of this document is Auth@@ or@@ ised for non @-@ business
in addition , concerns were expressed that the data on the stability of the drug and the drug to be mark@@ eted will not be sufficient .
the number of hepatitis C patients who responded to the treatment with Al@@ ph@@ eon and Ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A was similar in the clinical trial .
after setting the treatment with Al@@ ph@@ eon , the disease fl@@ amed up again in more patients than in the reference medicinal product ; in addition , Al@@ ph@@ eon had more side effects .
apart from this , the test used in the study to examine the question of how far the medicine is an immune response ( i.e. the body produces antibodies - specific proteins - against the drug ) is not adequately vali@@ dated .
it can be used for treatment of Im@@ pe@@ tig@@ o ( skin infection with cr@@ ust formation ) and small infected la@@ fir@@ ings ( cra@@ cks or cuts ) , abra@@ sions and se@@ wn wounds .
Al@@ tar@@ go is not intended to treat infections which have been proven or probably caused by meth@@ ic@@ il@@ ine @-@ resistant Stap@@ hy@@ lo@@ co@@ cc@@ us au@@ re@@ us ( MR@@ SA ) because Alar@@ con may not work against this type of infection .
Al@@ tar@@ go can be used in patients from the age of nine months , but in patients under 18 years the area to be treated may not be more than 2 % of the body &apos;s surface .
if the patient does not respond to treatment after two or three days , the doctor should examine the patient again and consider alternative treatments .
it works by blocking the bacterial ri@@ bos@@ omes ( the parts of the bacterial cell in which proteins are produced ) and thereby inhi@@ bits the growth of the bacteria .
the main indicator of efficacy was in all five studies the proportion of patients whose infection was ab@@ brevi@@ ated after the end of the treatment .
119 ( 8@@ 5.6 % ) of 139 patients under Al@@ tar@@ go and 37 ( 5@@ 2.1 % ) of 71 patients under plac@@ ebo responded to the treatment .
in the treatment of infected skin wounds , Al@@ tar@@ go and C@@ ef@@ al@@ ex@@ in showed similar response rates : if the results of both studies were taken together in skin wounds , about 90 % of both groups responded to the treatment .
in these two studies , however , it was found that Al@@ tar@@ go is not effective enough in the treatment of ab@@ sc@@ esses ( filled ca@@ vi@@ ties in the body tissue ) or of infections caused by MR@@ SA .
the most common side effect with Al@@ tar@@ go ( observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) is an irrit@@ ation at the job site .
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that the benefits of Al@@ tar@@ go in short @-@ term treatment of the following super@@ ficial skin infections are out@@ weigh@@ ed : • Im@@ pe@@ tig@@ o , • infected small in@@ fir@@ mary , abra@@ sions or se@@ wn wounds .
in May 2007 , the European Commission granted Gla@@ x@@ o Group Ltd. a permit for the placing of alt@@ ar@@ go on the entire European Union .
patients with no improvement within two to three days should be examined again and considered an alternative therapy ( see section 4.4 ) .
in the case of a sensi@@ ti@@ zing or severe local irrit@@ ation by using re@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin o@@ int@@ ment , treatment is broken down , the o@@ int@@ ment is me@@ tic@@ ul@@ ously wi@@ ped out and an appropriate alternative therapy of the infection will begin .
retin@@ os@@ ulin should not be used to treat infections in which MR@@ SA is known as path@@ ogen or is suspected ( see Section 5.1 ) .
in clinical trials with secondary open wounds the efficacy of retin@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin was insufficient in patients with infections caused by a meth@@ ic@@ ill@@ in @-@ resistant Stap@@ hy@@ lo@@ co@@ cc@@ us au@@ re@@ us ( MR@@ SA ) .
alternative therapy should be considered if no improvement or deteri@@ oration occurs after 2 to 3 days of treatment .
the effect of the simultaneous use of retin@@ os@@ ulin and other top@@ ical remedies on the same skin surface has not been examined and the simultaneous application of other top@@ ical medicines is not recommended .
a clin@@ ically relevant in@@ hibition in vi@@ vo is not to be expected in vi@@ vo due to the low plasma concentrations which have been achieved in humans based on top@@ ical application on the skin or infected surface wounds ( see Section 5.2 ) .
3 After the same oral administration of 2 times daily 200 mg k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ol , the mean Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin AU@@ C ( 0 @-@ 24 ) and c@@ max after top@@ ical application of 1 % re@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin o@@ int@@ ment increased by 81 % according to top@@ ical application of 1 % re@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin o@@ int@@ ment .
due to the low system@@ ic exposure to top@@ ical application in patients , dosage adjustments are not required if top@@ ical Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is applied during system@@ ic treatment with CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors .
animal studies have shown a reproductive toxic@@ ity after oral intake and are insufficient with regard to a statement on the birth and the fet@@ al / post@@ nat@@ al development ( see Section 5.3 ) .
retin@@ os@@ ulin o@@ int@@ ment should only be used during pregnancy if a top@@ ical anti@@ bacterial therapy is clearly indicated and the application of retin@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is prefer@@ able to the administration of a system@@ ic antibiotic .
the decision whether breast @-@ feeding continues / termin@@ ates or the therapy with Al@@ tar@@ go should be continued is between the benefits of breast@@ feeding for the inf@@ ant and the benefits of the Al@@ tar@@ go therapy for the woman to weigh .
in clinical trials involving 2,@@ 150 patients with super@@ ficial skin infections that have applied al@@ tar@@ go was the most commonly reported side effect irrit@@ ation at the place of destination which concerned about 1 % of patients .
mode of operation Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is a semi @-@ synthetic deriv@@ ative of P@@ leu@@ ro@@ mu@@ ti@@ lin , a substance isolated from Cl@@ it@@ op@@ il@@ us pass@@ eck@@ eri@@ anus ( formerly called Ple@@ ur@@ ot@@ us pass@@ eck@@ eri@@ anus ) .
the mechanism of action of retin@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin rests on the selective in@@ hibition of bacterial protein synthesis by interaction with a specific binding site of the 50@@ S sub@@ unit of the bacterial ri@@ bos@@ ome , which differs from the binding sites of other ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al inter@@ acting anti@@ bacterial substances .
data indicates that the binding site ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al protein L@@ 3 is involved and is located in the region of the ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al P @-@ binding site and the pep@@ tide transfer@@ ase centre .
by binding to this binding point , P@@ leu@@ ro@@ mu@@ ti@@ line inhi@@ bits the pep@@ tide transfer , blocking partly P @-@ binding sites and prevents the normal formation of active 50@@ S ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al sub@@ units .
if , due to the local pre@@ val@@ ence of resistance , the application of Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin at least some forms of infection appear thou@@ ght@@ ful , consultation by experts should be sought .
there were no differences in the in @-@ vitro activity of Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin against S.@@ A@@ UR@@ EU@@ S , regardless of whether the isol@@ ates were sensitive or resistant to meth@@ ic@@ ill@@ in .
in case of non @-@ compliance with S.@@ A@@ UR@@ EU@@ S , the presence of stra@@ ins with additional vir@@ ul@@ ence factors ( such as PV@@ L = Pant@@ on Valent@@ ine Leu@@ co@@ ci@@ din ) should be considered .
absorption In a study with healthy adults , 1 % re@@ ap@@ am@@ ul@@ ine o@@ int@@ ment was applied daily with oc@@ clu@@ sion on intact and lac@@ ed skin for up to 7 days .
in 5@@ 16 patients ( adults and children ) who received 1 % re@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin o@@ int@@ ment twice daily for 5 days for top@@ ical treatment of secondary trau@@ matic wounds , individual plasma samples were obtained .
the sampling took place on days 3 or 4 in the adult patients each before the medi@@ ation and with the children between 0 @-@ 12 hours after the last application .
however , the maximum individual system@@ ic intake in humans based on top@@ ical application of 1 % o@@ int@@ ment to 200 cm2 pe@@ eled skin ( c@@ max = 22 n@@ g / ml ; AU@@ C ( 0 @-@ 24 ) = 238 n@@ g · h / ml ) 660 times lower than the Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin IC@@ 50 for P@@ GP inhibit@@ or .
metabolism In vitro oxid@@ ative metabolism of retin@@ ec@@ am@@ ulin in human liver micro@@ som@@ es was primarily medi@@ ated by CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , with the low participation of CY@@ P2@@ C8 and CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 ( see Section 4.5 ) .
in studies on oral toxic@@ ity in rats ( 50 , 150 or 450 mg / kg ) , which were performed over 14 days , there were signs of adaptive liver and thy@@ roid changes .
in @-@ vitro examination on gene mut@@ ation and / or chromos@@ om@@ al effects in the mouse @-@ lymp@@ ho@@ oma test respectively in cultures of human peripheral blood lymp@@ ho@@ cytes as well as in the rats microsc@@ opy test for in @-@ vi@@ vo analysis of chromos@@ om@@ al effects .
there were neither male nor female rats signs of reduced fertility in oral dos@@ ages of 50 , 150 or 450 mg / kg / day , resulting in up to 5 times higher exposure than the highest estimated exposure to humans ( top@@ ical application to 200 cm2 pe@@ aked skin ) :
in an embry@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity study in rats were determined at oral dos@@ ages of ≥ 150 mg / kg / day ( according to the ≥ 3 times the estimated human exposure ( see above ) ) , development toxic@@ ity ( reduced body weight of the fo@@ etus and delayed Os@@ si@@ fication ) and mat@@ ernal toxic@@ ity .

ambi@@ ance is used to protect hepatitis A and Hepatitis B ( diseases affecting the liver ) in children between one and 15 years that are not immune to these two diseases .
ambi@@ ance is being applied as part of a two @-@ dose regim@@ en , whereby protection against hepatitis B may only be achieved after the second dose is administered .
for this reason , Ambi@@ rix may only be used if there is a low risk of hepatitis B infection during imm@@ uni@@ zation and it is ensured that the vacc@@ ination plan consisting of two doses can be brought to an end .
if a booster dose is requested against hepatitis A or B , Ambi@@ rix or another hepatitis A or B vaccine can be given .
vacc@@ ines work by &quot; contributing &quot; to the immune system ( the body &apos;s natural def@@ ences ) , as it can fight against a disease .
after a child has received the vaccine , the immune system recognizes the viruses and surface anti@@ gens as &quot; alien &quot; and produces antibodies against it .
Ambi@@ rix contains the same components as the V@@ acc@@ ine Twin@@ Star Ad@@ ult which has been approved since 1996 and has been the approved Poly@@ rix Children &apos;s V@@ acc@@ ine since 1997 .
the three vacc@@ ines are used to protect against the same diseases , but Twin@@ Star adults and Twin@@ rix children are administered as part of a three @-@ dose vacc@@ ination plan .
because Ambi@@ rix and Twin@@ Star adults contain identical constitu@@ ents , some of the data that support the use of Twin@@ rix adults have also been used as evidence of the application of Ambi@@ rix .
the main indicator of efficacy was the share of vacc@@ inated children who had developed a protective antibody concentrations one month after the last injection .
in an additional study with 208 children , the efficacy of the vaccine was compared with a six @-@ month and a 12 month interval between the two injec@@ tions .
Ambi@@ rix led between 98 and 100 % of vacc@@ inated children a month after the last injection for the development of protective antibody concentrations against hepatitis A and B .
the additional study showed that the degree of Ambi@@ rix protection was similar in a six month and a 12 @-@ month interval between injec@@ tions .
the most common side effects of Ambi@@ rix ( observed in more than 1 out of 10 vaccine doses ) are head@@ ache , lack of appetite , pain at the injection point , redness , difference ( fatigue ) as well as irrit@@ ability .
Ambi@@ rix may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to the active substances , one of the other components or Ne@@ om@@ y@@ cin ( an antibiotic ) .
August 2002 , the European Commission granted Gla@@ x@@ o@@ S@@ mith@@ K@@ line Bi@@ olog@@ icals a.@@ a. to the company Gla@@ x@@ o@@ S@@ mith@@ K@@ line Bi@@ olog@@ icals .
the standar@@ dis@@ ation plan for prim@@ ers with Ambi@@ rix is made up of two doses of vacc@@ ines , the first dose is given at the date of choice and the second dose is administered between six and twelve months after the first dose .
if a booster shot is desired for Hepatitis A as well as Hepatitis B , vacc@@ ines may be vacc@@ inated with the corresponding mon@@ ov@@ al@@ ant vacc@@ ines or with a combination vaccine .
the anti @-@ hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen ( anti @-@ H@@ B@@ s@@ A@@ g ) and anti @-@ hepatitis A Virus ( anti @-@ H@@ B@@ s@@ A@@ g ) antibodies ( anti @-@ H@@ B@@ s@@ A@@ g ) and anti @-@ hepatitis B virus ( anti @-@ H@@ B@@ s@@ A@@ g ) antibodies react in the same size as after vacc@@ ination using the respective mon@@ ov@@ al@@ ent vacc@@ ines .
it is not yet fully ensured whether immun@@ o@@ competent persons who have responded to hepatitis A vacc@@ ination require a booster as protection , as they may also be protected by immun@@ ological memory even in case of no longer det@@ ectable antibodies .
3 As with all injection vacc@@ ines , the possibility of medical treatment and monitoring should always be available immediately for the rare case of an@@ aphy@@ lac@@ tic response after the injection of the vaccine .
if a fast protection against hepatitis B is required , the standar@@ dis@@ ation scheme is recommended with the combination vaccine that contains 360 ELISA units of form@@ al@@ in@@ in@@ activated hepatitis A virus and 10 µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen .
in case of hem@@ odi@@ aly@@ sis patients and persons with disorders of the immune system , there may be no adequate anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ - and anti @-@ h@@ b antibody , so that additional doses may be needed in these cases .
since intra@@ operative injection or intra@@ muscular administration could lead to a sub@@ optimal success , these injec@@ tions should be avoided .
in thro@@ m@@ bo@@ cy@@ top@@ enia or blood cl@@ ot@@ ting disorders , however , ambi@@ tions may be inj@@ ected sub@@ cut@@ aneous , as in these cases it can lead to bleeding after intra@@ muscular administration .
if Ambi@@ rix was given in the second year of life in the form of a separate injection with a combined di@@ ph@@ th@@ eri@@ e- , tet@@ anus , ac@@ ell@@ ular per@@ t@@ uss@@ is@@ - , in@@ activated poli@@ omyel@@ i@@ tis@@ - and Ha@@ em@@ op@@ hil@@ us influ@@ enza vaccine ( DT@@ PA @-@ IP@@ V / HI@@ B ) or with a combined meas@@ ure@@ - m@@ umps @-@ rub@@ ella vaccine , the immune response was sufficient to all anti@@ gens ( see Section 5.1 ) .
in patients with immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy or in patients with immune defects it must be assumed that no adequate immune response is possible .
in a clinical study conducted with 3 doses of this formulation in adults , the frequency of pain , redness , swelling , mat@@ ur@@ acy , g@@ astro@@ ent@@ eri@@ tis , head@@ ache and fever were comparable to the frequency observed in the earlier Thi@@ om@@ eri@@ an and preserv@@ ative @-@ containing vaccine formulation .
in clinical trials , 20@@ 29 ino@@ cul@@ ations were administered to a total of 10@@ 27 vacc@@ ines at the age of 1 up to and including 15 years .
in a study of 300 participants at the age of 12 up to and including 15 years , the toler@@ ability of Ambi@@ rix was compared with the 3 @-@ dose combination vaccine .
only exceptions were the higher frequencies of pain and difference on a calculation basis per injection dose ambi@@ ance , but not based on a calculation basis per person .
pain was observed after the administration of Ambi@@ rix at 5@@ 0.8 % of the subjects compared with 39.@@ 1 % in the subjects after the dose of the 3 @-@ dose combination vaccine .
after the complete ino@@ cul@@ ation cycle , 6@@ 6.@@ 4 % of the subjects who had given the ambient dose reported about pain , compared to 6@@ 3.8 % in the subjects ino@@ cul@@ ated with the 3 @-@ dose combination vaccine .
however , the frequency of difference was comparable per pro@@ band ( i.e. across the whole vaccine cycle at 39.@@ 6 % of the subjects receiving the Ambi@@ rix , compared with 36.@@ 2 % in the subjects receiving the 3 @-@ dose combination vaccine ) .
the frequency of pronounced pain and difference was low and comparable to that observed after administration of the combination vaccine with the 3 @-@ doses vaccine .
in a comparative study of 1- to 11 @-@ year @-@ old ino@@ cul@@ ations , the presence of local reactions and general reactions in the Ambi@@ ri@@ x@@ group was comparable to that observed when administered with the 3 @-@ dose combination vaccine with 360 ELISA @-@ units of form@@ al@@ in@@ in@@ activated hepatitis B virus and 10 µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen .
however , with the 6@@ - to 11 @-@ year @-@ olds a frequent occurrence of pain ( at the injection point ) per dose , not per pro@@ band , was reported after vacc@@ ination with Ambi@@ rix .
the share of ino@@ cul@@ ations that reported severe side effects during the 2 @-@ dose vacc@@ ination scheme with Ambi@@ rix or during the 3 @-@ doses vaccine with the combination vaccine with 360 EL@@ IS@@ A- units of form@@ al@@ in@@ in@@ activated hepatitis B virus and 10 µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen was not statisti@@ cally different .
in clinical trials conducted in vacc@@ ination at the age of 1 to including 15 years , the Ser@@ o@@ conversion rates for anti @-@ HA@@ V were 9@@ 9.@@ 1 % one month after the first dose and 100 % one month after the second , for the month 6 administered dose ( d. h. in month 7 ) .
the Ser@@ o@@ conversion rates for anti @-@ H@@ Bs were 7@@ 4.2 % a month after the first dose and 100 % one month after the second , for the month 6 administered dose ( i.e. in month 7 ) .
7 In a comparative study carried out at 12@@ - to and including 15 @-@ year @-@ olds , 142 two doses of Ambi@@ rix and 147 were received with three doses .
in 289 people whose immun@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity was in@@ valuable , the ser@@ op@@ rot@@ ection rati@@ os ( SP in the table below ) against hepatitis B in the month 2 and 6 were significantly higher compared to the dose of the 3 @-@ dose vaccine .
the immune responses that were reached in a clinical comparative study at 1- to 11 @-@ year @-@ olds a month after completion of the full ino@@ cul@@ ation series ( i.e. in month 7 ) are listed in the following table .
both studies received either a 2 @-@ dose vacc@@ ination scheme with Ambi@@ rix or a 3 @-@ dose vaccine scheme with a combination vaccine with 360 ELISA units of form@@ al@@ in@@ in@@ activated hepatitis A virus and 10@@ µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen .
for persons who were between 12 and 15 years of age at the time of pri@@ mor@@ tising , the persist@@ ence of anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ - and Anti @-@ H@@ Bs @-@ antibodies could be detected over at least 24 months after imm@@ uni@@ zation with Ambi@@ rix in the 0 @-@ 6 @-@ month @-@ immun@@ isation scheme .
the immun@@ ore@@ action observed in this study against both anti@@ gens was comparable to that observed after vacc@@ ination of 3 doses with a combination vaccine consisting of 360 ELISA units of form@@ al@@ in@@ in@@ activated H@@ ep@@ ati@@ tis@@ - A @-@ Virus and 10 µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen in a dose volume of 0.5 ml .
in a clinical study from 12 - to including 15 @-@ year @-@ olds , it was possible to demonstrate that the persist@@ ence of anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ - and anti @-@ H@@ Bs @-@ antibodies is comparable to the 0 @-@ 6@@ - month @-@ vacc@@ ination pattern comparable to the 0 @-@ 12 @-@ month @-@ vaccine scheme .
if the first dose Ambi@@ rix was administered at the same time with the booster shot of a combined di@@ ph@@ th@@ eri@@ e- , tet@@ anus , az@@ ell@@ ular per@@ t@@ uss@@ is@@ - , in@@ activated poli@@ omyel@@ i@@ tis@@ - and 8 Ha@@ em@@ op@@ hil@@ us influ@@ enza vaccine ( DT@@ PA @-@ IP@@ V / HI@@ B ) or with the first dose of a combined meas@@ les @-@ m@@ umps @-@ rub@@ ella vaccine , the immune response was sufficient for all anti@@ gens .
a clinical study conducted with 3 doses of present formulation in adults showed similar ser@@ op@@ rot@@ ection and ser@@ o@@ conversion rates as for previous formulation .
the vaccine is to be examined both before and after res@@ piration for any foreign particles and / or physical visible changes .
pursuant to Article 114 of the Directive 2001 / 83 / EC , the revised version shall be carried out by a state laboratory or a laboratory authorized to this purpose .

the hepatitis A virus is usually transmitted by contaminated food and drinks , but can also be transmitted through other ways , such as bathing in waters contaminated by waste water .
you can feel very tired , have a dark urine , a pale face , yellow skin and / or eyes ( j@@ aun@@ dice ) and other symptoms that may require a stationary treatment .
as with all vacc@@ ines , Ambi@@ rix may not be completely protected from infection with hepatitis B or hepatitis B virus even if the complete ino@@ cul@@ ation series has been completed with 2 doses .
if you / your child is already infected with hepatitis A or hepatitis B virus before the two vacc@@ inations were administered ( although you / your child still feel uncomfortable or sick at the time of the vaccine ) , vacc@@ ination may not prevent a disease .
a protection against other infections that damage the liver or cause symptoms similar to those of hepatitis A or hepatitis B infection can not be medi@@ ated .
• If an allergic reaction to ambient or any part of this vaccine , including Ne@@ om@@ y@@ cin , an antibiotic , has already been shown to you / your child .
an allergic reaction can be expressed by itch@@ y skin r@@ ashes , short@@ ness of breath , or swelling of the face or tongue . • If an allergic reaction has occurred with you before an earlier vacc@@ ination against hepatitis A or Hepatitis B , if you / your child has a serious infection with fever .
• If you would like to have a quick protection against hepatitis B ( i.e. within 6 months and before the usually prescribed dose of the second ino@@ cul@@ ation dose ) .
at a possible risk of infection with hepatitis B between the first and second vacc@@ ination , the doctor will advise you / your child from vacc@@ ination with Ambi@@ rix .
instead , he / she will recommend 3 injec@@ tions of a combined hepatitis A / Hepatitis B vaccine with a reduced content of effective ingredients per injection dosage ( 360 ELISA units of a form@@ al@@ in@@ in@@ activated hepatitis A virus and 10 micro@@ grams of a re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen ) .
the second vacc@@ ination dose of this vaccine with reduced content of effective ingredients is usually administered one month after the first dose and should give you / your child a vacc@@ ination protection before the end of the vacc@@ ination series .
sometimes Ambi@@ rix is inj@@ ected with people who suffer from severe blood cl@@ ots , under the skin and not into the muscle . • If you / your child is weak@@ ened due to illness or treatment in your / her body &apos;s defense , or if you / your child under@@ goes a hem@@ odi@@ aly@@ sis .
am@@ bition can be given in these cases , but the immune response of these persons to vacc@@ ination cannot be sufficient so that a blood test may be required to see how strongly the reaction to vacc@@ ination is .
21 Tell your doctor if you take / take more medicines ( including those you can get without prescription ) or if you / your child have been vacc@@ inated and / or immun@@ og@@ lob@@ ul@@ ins ( antibodies ) have been given / has or has been planned in the near future .
however , it may be that in this case the immune response to the vaccine is not sufficient and therefore the person is not protected against one or both hepatitis A and B viruses .
if another vaccine must be given at the same time with Ambi@@ rix , it should be vacc@@ inated in separate areas and possible extre@@ mi@@ ties .
if Ambi@@ rix is to be administered at the same time or shortly before or after an injection of immun@@ og@@ lob@@ ul@@ ins , it is likely that the reaction to the vaccine will nonetheless be sufficient .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; usually , ambi@@ ance is not given to pregnant women or nursing women unless it is urgent that they are vacc@@ inated against hepatitis A and hepatitis B . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
important information about certain other components of Ambi@@ rix Please inform your doctor if an allergic reaction to Ne@@ om@@ y@@ cin ( antibiotic ) has already been shown to you / your child .
if you miss the agreed appointment for the second vacc@@ ination , talk to your doctor and arrange a new appointment as soon as possible .
♦ very common ( more than 1 case per 10 used doses ) : • pain or dis@@ comfort at the insertion point or redness • Mat@@ iness • Rei@@ z@@ ability • Head@@ ache • lack of appetite
♦ often ( up to 1 case per 10 used doses ) : • swelling at the injection site • fever ( above 38 ° C ) • he@@ ade@@ dness • g@@ astro@@ intestinal disorders
further side effects that were reported very rarely days or weeks after vacc@@ ination using comparable combination or single vacc@@ ines against hepatitis A and hepatitis B ( less than 1 case per 10,000 doses ) are :
these include spati@@ ally limited or expanded r@@ ashes that can be itch@@ y or flower @-@ shaped , swelling of the eye area and face , abnormal breathing or swal@@ lowing , sudden drop of blood pressure and un@@ consciousness .
flu @-@ like dis@@ comfort , including shi@@ vering , muscle and joint pain sei@@ zur@@ es , di@@ zz@@ iness , mis@@ percep@@ tions such as t@@ ing@@ ling and &quot; mei@@ sen@@ ing , &quot; multiple sclerosis , diseases of the optic nerve , loss of sensation or mobility of some body parts , severe head@@ aches and stiff@@ ness of neck , inter@@ ruption of normal brain functions

23 . inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if one of the listed side effects affects you or your child significantly or you notice side effects not indicated in this package .
ambi@@ ance is available in packs of 1 and 10 with or without need@@ les and in packs of 50 without need@@ les .
based on the data that has been known for placing on the market since issu@@ ance of the first permit , CH@@ MP demonstrated that the benefits @-@ risk ratio for am@@ bition remains positive .
however , as am@@ bition has been put into circulation only in a Member State ( in the Netherlands since May 2003 ) , the safety data available for this drug is limited due to low patient exposure .
ammon@@ ium can also be used for patients at the age of more than a month with in@@ complete enzyme defect or hyper@@ velocity enc@@ ephal@@ opath@@ y ( brain damage due to high ammon@@ ia concentrations ) in pre@@ history .
ammon@@ ium is divided into several individual doses to the meals - swal@@ lowed , mixed under the food or administered via a Gast@@ ro@@ stom@@ i@@ esch@@ l@@ auch ( through the abdominal wall into the stomach leading hose ) or a nose probe ( through the nose into the stomach leading hose ) .
it was not a comparative study because ammon@@ ium could not be compared with another treatment or with plac@@ ebo ( a pseu@@ do @-@ drug , that is , without active ingredient ) .
it can also lead to loss of appetite , abnormal aci@@ dity in the blood , depression , irrit@@ ability , head@@ ache , f@@ ainting , fluid retention , taste problems or taste of taste , stomach pain , vom@@ iting , nausea , con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation , skin rash , unpleasant body odor or weight gain .
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that ammon@@ ia in patients with disorders of the ure@@ a cycle effectively prevents high ammon@@ ia levels .
ammon@@ ium was approved under &quot; exceptional circumstances , &quot; because only limited information on this medicine was prescribed due to the rar@@ ity of the disease at the time of approval .
the application is indicated in all patients showing a complete lack of enzyme already in new@@ bor@@ ns ( within the first 28 days of life ) .
in patients with a late @-@ mani@@ ac form ( incomplete enzy@@ matic defect that mani@@ f@@ ests itself after the first month of life ) , there is an indication of the use when an@@ am@@ n@@ esis contains hyper@@ ammon@@ ia enc@@ ephal@@ opath@@ y .
for inf@@ ants , for children who are unable to swal@@ low tablets or for patients with dy@@ sph@@ ag@@ ia AM@@ MON@@ A@@ PS is also available in gran@@ ular form .
the daily dose is calculated individually taking into account the protein tolerance and the daily protein intake needed for the growth and the development of the patient &apos;s daily protein intake .
according to previous clinical experience , the normal daily dose sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate is : • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day in children with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9.@@ 9 - 13.@@ 0 g / m ² / day in children with a body weight over 20 kg as well as adolescents and adults .
in patients suffering from an early manifest defect of carb@@ am@@ yl phosph@@ ate syn@@ th@@ et@@ ase or or@@ ni@@ thine transc@@ arb@@ am@@ yl@@ ase , the sub@@ stitution of cit@@ rul@@ line or ar@@ gin@@ ine is required at a dose of 0.@@ 17 g / kg / day or 3.8 g / m ² / day .
patients with ar@@ gin@@ ine os@@ u@@ cc@@ inate syn@@ th@@ et@@ ase deficiency must receive ar@@ gin@@ ine in a dose of 0.4 - 0.7 g / kg / day or 8.@@ 8 - 15.@@ 4 g / m ² / day .
AM@@ MON@@ A@@ PS tablets may not be given to patients with dy@@ sph@@ ag@@ ia since there is a risk of es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al ul@@ cer@@ ation when the tablets do not immediately enter the stomach .
each tablet AM@@ MON@@ A@@ PS contains 62 mg ( 2.7 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium , equivalent to 2.5 g ( 108 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium per 20@@ g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate , which corresponds to the maximum daily dose .
therefore , AM@@ MON@@ A@@ PS should only be used with caution in patients with con@@ ges@@ tive heart failure or severe ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency as well as in clinical conditions associated with sodium retention and o@@ ede@@ ma .
since metabolism and ex@@ cre@@ tion of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate over the liver and kid@@ neys is carried out , AM@@ MON@@ A@@ PS should only be used with extreme caution in patients with liver or kidney failure .
the importance of these results regarding pregnant women is unknown ; the use of AM@@ MON@@ A@@ PS during pregnancy is therefore contra@@ indicated ( see 4.3 ) .
with sub@@ cut@@ aneous administration of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate to young rats in high doses ( 190 - 4@@ 74 mg / kg ) , there was a slow@@ down in neur@@ onal prolifer@@ ation and increased neur@@ on loss .
there was also a delayed mat@@ ur@@ ation of cereb@@ ral syn@@ ap@@ ses and a reduced number of functioning nerve damage in the brain and thus a disability of brain growth .
it could not be determined whether phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate is ex@@ cre@@ ted by humans into breast milk , and for this reason the use of AM@@ MON@@ A@@ PS during breast@@ feeding is contra@@ indicated ( see 4.3 ) .
in clinical trials with AM@@ MON@@ A@@ PS , at least one un@@ desired event ( AE ) occurred at 56 % of the patients and 78 % of these adverse events were assumed to not be associated with AM@@ MON@@ A@@ PS .
the frequency is defined as follows : very common ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) , often ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) and occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1.000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) .
a likely toxic reaction to AM@@ MON@@ A@@ PS ( 450 mg / kg / day ) was reported by an 18 @-@ year @-@ old anor@@ ect@@ al patient , who developed a metabolic enc@@ ephal@@ opath@@ y in combination with lac@@ tic acid , severe hypo@@ kal@@ emia , arm@@ y@@ top@@ enia , peripheral neu@@ rop@@ athy and pancre@@ atitis .
an over@@ dose case occurred during a 5 month @-@ old inf@@ ant with an accidental over@@ dose of 10@@ g ( 13@@ 70 mg / kg ) .
these symptoms are associated with the accumulation of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate , which showed dose @-@ limiting neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity during intra@@ ven@@ ous administration of doses of up to 400 mg / kg / day .
phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate is a met@@ aboli@@ cally active compound con@@ jug@@ ated by acet@@ yl@@ ation with glut@@ amine to phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine , which is ex@@ cre@@ ted via the kid@@ neys .
Phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is comparable with ure@@ a ( both compounds contain 2 nit@@ ric atoms ) ; phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is therefore suitable as an alternative carrier for ex@@ cre@@ tion of excess nitrogen .
5 Pati@@ ents with dys@@ functions of the ure@@ a cycle can be assumed that for each gram the sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate is produced between 0.@@ 12 and 0.@@ 15 g phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine nitrogen .
it is important that the diagnosis is set at an early stage and the treatment will begin immediately to improve survival chances and clinical outcome .
the pre@@ diction of the premature manifest form of the disease with the appearance of the first symptoms in new@@ bor@@ ns was almost always f@@ ist , and the disease itself led to death even when treating with per@@ it@@ one@@ al di@@ aly@@ sis and essential amino acids or with their nitrogen @-@ free an@@ alogues within the first year of life .
by hem@@ odi@@ aly@@ sis , the use of alternative paths of nit@@ ric ex@@ cre@@ tion ( sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate , sodium ben@@ zo@@ ate and sodium phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate ) , protein @-@ reduced r@@ ust and eventually sub@@ stitution of essential amino acids , it was possible to increase the survival rate of new@@ born in post@@ part@@ al ( but within the first month of life ) to 80 % .
in patients whose disease was diagnosed in the course of pregnancy and which were already treated before the first occurrence of hyper@@ velocity enc@@ ephal@@ opath@@ y , the survival rate was 100 % , but even in these patients it came with time with many to mental disabilities or other neurolog@@ ical defic@@ its .
in patients with a late mani@@ ac form of the disease ( including female patients with the hetero@@ zy@@ got@@ ic form of the or@@ ni@@ thine transc@@ arb@@ am@@ yl@@ ase deficiency ) , which recovered from hyper@@ ammon@@ ia enc@@ ephal@@ opath@@ y and subsequently treated with sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate and a protein @-@ reduced diet , survival rate was 98 % .
already existing neurolog@@ ical defic@@ its are hardly reversible even in treatment and in some patients a further deteri@@ oration of the neurolog@@ ical condition can occur .
it is known that phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate is oxi@@ di@@ zed to phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate , which is enzy@@ mati@@ cally con@@ jug@@ ated in liver and kidney with phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine .
the concentrations of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate and its metabol@@ ites in plasma and urine were determined by dosage of a single dose of 5 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate for so@@ ber healthy adults and in patients with disorders of the ure@@ a cycle , ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in metabolism and with liver cir@@ rho@@ sis of oral doses of up to 20 g / day ( un@@ controlled studies ) .
the behaviour of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate and metabol@@ ites was also studied in cancer patients following intra@@ ven@@ ous administration of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate ( up to 2 g / m ² ) or phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate .
after an oral single dose of 5 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate in tablet form , measur@@ able plasma concentrations of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate were detected in 15 minutes after ing@@ es@@ tion .
in the majority of patients with ure@@ a @-@ cycle disorders or ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in , phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate ( 300 @-@ 650 mg / kg / day up to 20 g / day ) was not det@@ ectable on the next morning after ni@@ ghtly fasting .
in three out of six patients treated with cir@@ rho@@ sis of the liver treated with sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate ( 20 g / day or@@ ally in three individual doses ) , the middle phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate concentrations in plasma concentrations were five times higher than after the first gifts .
ex@@ cre@@ tion This drug is ex@@ cre@@ ted by the kid@@ neys within 24 hours to approximately 80 - 100 % in the form of the con@@ jug@@ ated product phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine .
according to the results of the Mic@@ ron@@ u@@ cle@@ us test , sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate had no concl@@ usive effects in rats treated with toxic and non @-@ toxic cans ( investigation 24 and 48 hours after oral dosing of an individual dose of 8@@ 78 to 2800 mg / kg ) .
AM@@ MON@@ A@@ PS gran@@ ulate is either taken or@@ ally ( inf@@ ants and children unable to swal@@ low tablets or patients with dy@@ sph@@ ag@@ ia ) or a ga@@ stro @-@ stom@@ i@@ ke or a nose probe .
according to previous clinical experience , the normal daily dose sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate is : • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day in new@@ bor@@ ns , inf@@ ants and children with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9.@@ 9 - 13.@@ 0 g / m ² / day in children with a body weight over 20 kg as well as adolescents and adults .
the concentration of ammon@@ ia , ar@@ gin@@ ine , essential amino acids ( especially bran@@ ched @-@ chain amino acids ) , car@@ nit@@ ine and ser@@ um proteins in plasma should be kept within the normal range .
in patients suffering from an early manifest defect of carb@@ am@@ yl phosph@@ ate syn@@ th@@ et@@ ase or or@@ ni@@ thine transc@@ arb@@ am@@ yl@@ ase , the sub@@ stitution of cit@@ rul@@ line or ar@@ gin@@ ine is required at a dose of 0.@@ 17 g / kg / day or 3.8 g / m ² / day .
AM@@ MON@@ A@@ PS gran@@ ulate contains 124 mg ( 5.4 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium per gram of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate , equivalent to 2.5 g ( 108 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium per 20 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate , which corresponds to the maximum daily dose .
if rat @-@ fet@@ ters were exposed before the birth of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate ( active metabol@@ ite by phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate ) , les@@ ions in the py@@ rami@@ ds of the brain rin@@ se occurred .
a likely toxic reaction to AM@@ MON@@ A@@ PS ( 450 mg / kg / day ) was reported by an 18 @-@ year @-@ old anor@@ ect@@ al patient , who developed a metabolic enc@@ ephal@@ opath@@ y in combination with lac@@ tic acid , severe hypo@@ kal@@ emia , arm@@ y@@ top@@ enia , peripheral neu@@ rop@@ athy and pancre@@ atitis .
Phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is comparable to ure@@ a ( both compounds contain 2 nit@@ ric atoms ) ; phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is therefore suitable as an alternative carrier for ex@@ cre@@ tion of excess
based on studies on the ex@@ cre@@ tion of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine in patients with disorders of the ure@@ a cycle can be assumed that for each gram the sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate is taken between 0.@@ 12 and 0.@@ 15 g phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine nitrogen .
already existing neurolog@@ ical defic@@ its are hardly reversible even in treatment , and in some patients a further deteri@@ oration of the neurolog@@ ical condition can occur .
after an oral single dose of 5 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate in gran@@ ular form , measur@@ able plasma concentrations of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate were detected in 15 minutes after ing@@ es@@ tion .
during the duration of the shelf life the patient can store the finished product once for a period of 3 months at a temperature of not above 25 ° C .
in this procedure the small measuring spoon contains 0,@@ 95 g , the medium measuring spoon of 2.@@ 9 g and the large measuring spoon 8.@@ 6 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate .
if a patient has to receive the medicine via a probe , AM@@ MON@@ A@@ PS can also be dissolved in water before use ( the sol@@ ub@@ ility of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate is up to 5 g in 10 ml of water ) .
in patients with these rare diseases , certain liver enzymes are missing , so that they cannot ex@@ crete the nitrogen @-@ containing waste products that accum@@ ulate in the body after eating proteins .
if you undertake laboratory tests , you must inform the doctor that you are taking AM@@ MON@@ A@@ PS , since sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate may affect the results of certain laboratory tests .
if you are taking AM@@ MON@@ A@@ PS with other medicines , please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you have taken other medicines or have taken it until recently , even if it is not prescription medicine .
during breast@@ feeding , you may not take AM@@ MON@@ A@@ PS as the medicine can go over to breast milk and harm your baby .
in rare cases confusion , head@@ aches , taste problems , leaving the ear , dis@@ orientation , memory disorders and a deteri@@ oration of existing neurolog@@ ical conditions have also been observed .
if you notice any of these symptoms , contact your doctor immediately or with the emergency reception of your hospital for the purpose of initi@@ ating appropriate treatment .
if you miss the intake of AM@@ MON@@ A@@ PS , take the appropriate dose as soon as possible with the next meal .
changes in blood pressure ( red blood cells , white blood cells , thro@@ m@@ bo@@ cytes ) , decreased appetite , depression , irrit@@ ability , head@@ ache , f@@ ainting , ur@@ inary retention , nausea , con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation , unpleasant skin smell , rash , kidney function disorders , weight gain and abnormal lab results .
please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if any of the listed side effects may significantly affect you or notice side effects that are not indicated in this use information .
you can no longer use AM@@ MON@@ A@@ PS in accordance with the exp@@ iry date specified on the carton and the container .
as AM@@ MON@@ A@@ PS looks and the contents of the pack AM@@ MON@@ A@@ PS tablets are of whi@@ tish color and oval shape , and they are provided with the embos@@ sing &quot; U@@ CY 500 . &quot;
30 If laboratory tests are carried out , you must inform the doctor that you are taking AM@@ MON@@ A@@ PS , since sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate may affect the results of certain laboratory tests .
if you are taking AM@@ MON@@ A@@ PS with other medicines , please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you have taken other medicines or have taken it until recently , even if it is not prescription medicine .
you should take AM@@ MON@@ A@@ PS to the same single dose or@@ ally or via a gast@@ ric fi@@ ber@@ th ( hose that runs through the abdominal wall directly into the stomach ) or a nose probe ( hose leading through the nose into the stomach ) .
31 • Take out of the container a he@@ aped spo@@ on@@ ful of gran@@ ulate . • En@@ rich a straight edge , e.g. a knife back over the edge of the measuring spoon to remove excess gran@@ ulate . • Rem@@ ove the recommended amount of measuring sco@@ op gran@@ ulate from the container .
An@@ gi@@ ox is used to treat adult patients with acute cor@@ on@@ ary syndrome ( AC@@ S , reduced blood supply to the heart ) , for example with un@@ stable ang@@ ina ( a form of pain in the chest with different strength ) or m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction ( heart attack ) without &quot; stress &quot; ( an an@@ om@@ al@@ ous measurement value for electro@@ cardi@@ ogram or EC@@ G ) .
if An@@ gi@@ ox is used to prevent blood cl@@ ots in patients under@@ going a PCI , a higher dose is administered and the in@@ fusion can be continued up to four hours after the procedure .
this can help patients with ang@@ ina or heart attack to maintain blood flow to the heart and increase the efficacy of a PCI .
nearly 14 000 patients participated in the main study on the treatment of AC@@ S in which the effect of angi@@ ox@@ in in combination with a gly@@ cop@@ rot@@ ein @-@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or ( G@@ PI , other medicines to prevent blood cl@@ ots ) was compared with conventional combination treatment with he@@ par@@ in ( another anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ant ) and a G@@ PI .
during the PCI , patients often used a st@@ ent ( a short tube remaining in the ar@@ tery to prevent closure ) and they additionally received other medicines to prevent blood cl@@ ots such as Ab@@ ci@@ xi@@ mab and A@@ spir@@ in .
in the treatment of AC@@ S , An@@ gi@@ ox - with or without G@@ PI &apos;s ability - was as effective in the prevention of new events ( deaths , heart attacks or rev@@ as@@ cul@@ ari@@ zation ) after 30 days or a year overall as effective as conventional treatment .
in patients who under@@ went a PCI , An@@ gi@@ ox was as effective with regard to all indicators as he@@ par@@ in , except for severe bleeding in which it was significantly more effective than he@@ par@@ in .
An@@ gi@@ ox may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to Bi@@ val@@ ira , other mil@@ k@@ ud@@ ine or any of the other ingredients .
it may also not be used in patients who recently had bleeding , as well as in people with severe hyper@@ tension or severe kidney problems or heart infection .
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that An@@ gi@@ ox is an acceptable replacement for he@@ par@@ in during AC@@ S and PCI .
in September 2004 , the European Commission granted approval to the company The Medic@@ ines Company UK Ltd for the transport of angi@@ ox@@ in throughout the European Union .
for the treatment of adult patients with acute cor@@ on@@ ary syndrome ( un@@ stable ang@@ ina / non @-@ ST @-@ up@@ lift inf@@ ar@@ ction ( IA / N@@ ST@@ EM@@ I ) ) in case of an emergency intervention or if an early intervention is provided .
the recommended starting dose of An@@ gi@@ ox in patients with AC@@ S is an intra@@ ven@@ ous dosage of 0.1 mg / kg followed by an in@@ fusion of 0,25 mg / kg / h .
if a PCI is carried out in another sequence , an additional stu@@ b of 0.5 mg / kg should be given and the in@@ fusion for the duration of the intervention should be increased to 1.@@ 75 mg / kg / h .
according to the clinical requirements , the reduced in@@ fusion dose of 0.25 mg / kg / h can be taken after the PCI for 4 to 12 hours .
a dosage of 0.5 mg / kg should be administered immediately before the procedure , followed by an in@@ fusion of 1.@@ 75 mg / kg / h for the duration of the operation .
the recommended dosage of An@@ gi@@ ox in patients with a PCI consists of an initial intra@@ ven@@ ous dosage of 0.75 mg / kg of body weight and an immediately subsequent intra@@ ven@@ ous in@@ fusion with a dose of 1.@@ 75 mg / kg of body weight / h at least for the duration of the surgery .
the safety and efficacy of An@@ gi@@ ox &apos;s sole bol@@ us application was not examined and is not recommended even if a short PCI operation is planned .
if this value ( ACT after 5 minutes ) is shortened to under 225 seconds , a second bol@@ us setting of 0.3 mg / kg / body@@ weight should take place .
in order to reduce the occurrence of lower ACT values , the re@@ constitu@@ ent and dil@@ uted medicinal product should be carefully mixed before use and the dosage dose should be administered intra@@ ven@@ ously .
as soon as the ACT value is more than 225 seconds , further supervision is no longer required , provided that the 1.@@ 75 mg / kg of in@@ fusion dose is administered properly .
in patients with moderate kidney function restriction ( G@@ FR 30 @-@ 59 ml / min ) , which are under@@ going a PCI ( whether treated with Bi@@ val@@ ira against AC@@ S or not ) , a lower inf@@ usi@@ onal rate of 1.4 mg / kg / h should be used .
if the ACT value is less than 225 seconds , a second dosage dose of 0.3 mg / kg is to be administered and the ACT 5 minutes after the second Bolshevik dose should be checked again .
in patients with moderate kidney damage , which were included in the phase II@@ I@@ - PCI trial ( RE@@ PLA@@ CE @-@ 2 ) , which were used for approval , the ACT was 5 minutes after the dosage of the Bi@@ val@@ ira @-@ Bol@@ us without dosage adjustment with an average of 366 ± 89 seconds .
3 In patients with severe kidney damage ( G@@ FR &lt; 30 ml / min ) and also for di@@ aly@@ sis patients An@@ gi@@ ox is contra@@ indicated ( see section 4.3 ) .
treatment with angi@@ ox can be initiated 30 minutes after the intra@@ ven@@ ous administration of un@@ frac@@ tion@@ ated he@@ par@@ in or 8 hours after the sub@@ cut@@ aneous administration of low @-@ molecular he@@ par@@ in .
• Sensi@@ tive hyper@@ sensitivity to active agent or other components or against de@@ od@@ ine • active bleeding or increased risk of bleeding due to mal@@ functioning of hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in system and / or ir@@ reversible bacterial endo@@ cardi@@ tis . • severe kidney damage ( G@@ FR &lt; 30 ml / min ) and for di@@ aly@@ sis @-@ based patients
patients are carefully monitored during treatment with regard to symptoms and signs of bleeding , especially when Bi@@ val@@ ira is given in combination with another anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ant ( see Section 4.5 ) .
even though most hem@@ or@@ rh@@ ages are encountered in arter@@ ial pun@@ cture sites in case of PCI patients under Bi@@ val@@ ira , a per@@ cut@@ aneous cor@@ on@@ ary intervention ( PCI ) may occur during the treatment principle throughout hem@@ or@@ rh@@ ages .
in patients taking War@@ far@@ in and treated with Bi@@ val@@ ira , monitoring the IN@@ R value ( International Norm@@ alised R@@ atio ) should be taken into consideration in order to ensure that the value after the treatment with Bi@@ val@@ ira reaches the level prior to treatment .
based on the knowledge of the mechanism of action of anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants ( he@@ par@@ in , war@@ far@@ in , thro@@ mb@@ oly@@ tics or thro@@ m@@ bo@@ cy@@ te aggreg@@ ates ) , it can be assumed that these active substances increase the risk of bleeding .
in combination with thro@@ m@@ bo@@ cy@@ te aggreg@@ ates or anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants , the clinical and biological hem@@ o@@ sta@@ sis parameters are regularly monitored .
the animal experimental investigations are in@@ sufficiently in relation to pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , child@@ birth or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) .
46@@ 12 were random@@ ised to Bi@@ val@@ ira alone , 4@@ 604 were random@@ ised to Bi@@ val@@ ira and G@@ PI@@ I@@ b / II@@ I@@ a In@@ hi@@ bit@@ or and 4@@ 60@@ 3 were random@@ ised to either un@@ frac@@ tion@@ ated ha@@ par@@ in or E@@ no@@ x@@ apar@@ in plus G@@ PI@@ I@@ b / II@@ I@@ a In@@ hi@@ bit@@ or .
both in the Bi@@ val@@ ira Group and in the comparative groups treated with He@@ par@@ in , it was more common in women as well as in patients over 65 years of un@@ desirable events than in male or younger patients .
severe bleeding was defined according to AC@@ U@@ ITY and Tim@@ i scales for severe bleeding as in the foot@@ notes of table 2 .
both mild and severe hem@@ or@@ rh@@ ages were significantly less frequent in Bi@@ val@@ ira than in the groups with he@@ par@@ in plus G@@ PI@@ I@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or and bi@@ vali@@ dru@@ din plus G@@ PI@@ I@@ b / II@@ I@@ a- In@@ hi@@ bit@@ or ( see table 2 ) .
an AC@@ U@@ ITY heavy bleeding was defined as one of the following events : intra@@ cran@@ ial , retro@@ per@@ it@@ one@@ al , intra@@ ocular bleeding or bleeding in the pun@@ cture area , reduction of hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in mirror ≥ 3 g / dl with known bleeding area , re@@ operation due to bleeding , application of blood products for trans@@ fusion .
other , less frequently observed bleeding loc@@ aliz@@ ations that occurred with more than 0.1 % ( occasionally ) were &quot; other &quot; pun@@ cture sites , retro@@ per@@ it@@ one@@ al , g@@ astro@@ intestinal , ear , nose , or neck .
the following information about side effects is based on data from a clinical study with Bi@@ val@@ ira in 6000 patients under@@ going a PCI .
both in the Bi@@ val@@ ira Group and in the comparative groups treated with he@@ par@@ in , it was more common in women as well as in patients over 65 years of un@@ desirable events than in male or younger patients .
both mild and severe hem@@ or@@ rh@@ ages were significantly less frequent in Bi@@ val@@ ira than in the comparative group under He@@ par@@ in plus G@@ PI@@ I@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or .
the following side effects , which are not listed above , were reported after extensive use in practice and are group@@ ed according to system organ classes in Table 6 .
in the case of an over@@ dose , the treatment with Bi@@ val@@ ira is immediately termin@@ ated and the patient is closely mes@@ hed in view of signs of bleeding .
An@@ gi@@ ox contains Bi@@ val@@ ira , a direct and specific thro@@ mb@@ in inhibit@@ or , which bin@@ ds to the cataly@@ tic center as well as on the an@@ ion @-@ binding region of Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in regardless of whether Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in is bound in the liquid phase or cl@@ ots .
the bonding of Bi@@ val@@ ira to Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in , and there@@ with its effect , is reversible because Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in , on its part , slowly spl@@ its the bonding of Bi@@ val@@ ira @-@ AR@@ G3 @-@ Pro@@ 4 , which re@@ generates the function of the active centre of Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in .
in addition , a thro@@ m@@ bo@@ cy@@ top@@ enia / he@@ par@@ in @-@ induced thro@@ m@@ bo@@ cy@@ top@@ enia / he@@ par@@ in @-@ induced thro@@ m@@ bo@@ cy@@ top@@ enia / he@@ par@@ in @-@ induced thro@@ m@@ bo@@ cy@@ top@@ enia ( H@@ IT / H@@ IT@@ TS ) was induced in the past not to in@@ duce thro@@ m@@ bo@@ cy@@ te ag@@ gregation reaction .
in healthy subjects and in patients , Bi@@ val@@ er@@ u@@ din shows a dose and concentration @-@ dependent anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ atory effect , which is occupied by the extension of ACT , a@@ P@@ TT , PT , IN@@ R and TT .
if a PCI was performed following a PCI , an additional stu@@ b of 0.@@ 5mg / kg of Bi@@ val@@ er@@ u@@ din should be given and the in@@ fusion for the duration of the surgery should be increased to 1.@@ 75@@ mg / kg / h .
in the arm A of the AC@@ U@@ ITY study , un@@ frac@@ tion@@ ated he@@ par@@ in or eth@@ no@@ x@@ apar@@ in was administered in patients with un@@ stable ang@@ ina / non @-@ ST ho@@ ist@@ ing inf@@ ar@@ ction ( IA / N@@ ST@@ EM@@ I ) in accordance with the relevant guidelines for the treatment of acute cor@@ on@@ ary syndrome ( AC@@ S ) .
patients in arm A and B were also random@@ ised to obtain a G@@ PI@@ I@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or either before starting the angi@@ ography ( at the time of random@@ isation ) or at the PCI .
the AC@@ U@@ ITY study included the characteristics of high @-@ risk patients who required angi@@ ography within 72 hours , spread evenly across the 3 arms .
approximately 77 % of patients had a recur@@ ring isch@@ emia , 70 % had dynamic EC@@ G changes or increased cardiac biom@@ ar@@ kers , 28 % had diabetes and approximately 99 % of all patients under@@ went a angi@@ ography within 72 hours .

A@@ pi@@ dra is used to treat adults , adolescents and children from 6 years with diabetes that require insulin treatment .
A@@ pi@@ dra is inj@@ ected sub@@ cut@@ aneous ( under the skin ) into the abdominal wall , the upper arm or upper arm or administered as a permanent in@@ fusion with an insulin pump .
diabetes is a disease in which the body does not produce enough insulin to regulate glucose levels ( sugar ) in the blood or not to effectively process insulin .
insulin l@@ ul@@ is@@ ine very slightly differs from human insulin , and the change means that it has a quicker effect and has a shorter duration than a short @-@ acting human insulin .
A@@ pi@@ dra was used in combination with a long @-@ acting insulin in patients with type 1 diabetes , in which the body cannot produce insulin , in two studies with a total of 1,@@ 5@@ 49 adults and in a study of 5@@ 72 children aged between four and 17 years .
in type 2 diabetes , where the body cannot work effectively , A@@ pi@@ dra was studied in a study of 8@@ 78 adults .
the main indicator of efficacy was to change the concentration of the substance gly@@ cos@@ yl@@ ated hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in ( H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) in the blood that indicates how well the blood sugar is adjusted .
in the first study with adults with type 1 diabetes , a reduction of 0.@@ 14 % ( from 7.@@ 60 % to 7.@@ 46 % ) was observed after six months versus a reduction of 0.@@ 14 % in insulin c@@ lis@@ ions .
in adults with type 2 diabetes , the reduction of H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c concentration was 0.@@ 46 % after six months with A@@ pi@@ dra compared to 0,30 % with human normal insulin .
A@@ pi@@ dra may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to insulin l@@ ul@@ is@@ in or any of the other ingredients , or in patients who are already suffering from hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia .
the doses of A@@ pi@@ dra might need to be adjusted if it is administered together with a number of other medicines which can affect the blood glucose level .
in September 2004 , the European Commission granted approval to the company San@@ of@@ i @-@ Av@@ entis Deutschland GmbH for the placing of A@@ pi@@ dra in the entire European Union .
A@@ pi@@ dra is used as sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection either in the area of the abdominal wall , the thig@@ h or delta muscle , or sub@@ cut@@ aneous through continuous in@@ fusion into the area of the abdominal muscles .
due to the reduced glucose availability capacity and the reduced insulin metabolism , insulin demand in patients with a reduction in liver function can be reduced .
any change in effect , brand ( manufacturer ) , insulin type ( normal , N@@ PH , z@@ ine delays etc . ) , the type of insulin ( animal insulin ) and / or the manufacturing method may involve a change in insulin needs .
3 An insufficient dosage or dis@@ continuation of treatment , in particular in patients with insulin @-@ based diabetes , may result in hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia and di@@ ab@@ etic k@@ eto@@ aci@@ dosis . these conditions are potentially life @-@ threatening .
changing a patient to another insulin type or insulin from another manufacturer should take place under strict medical supervision and may necess@@ itate a change in dosage .
the timing of the occurrence of hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia depends on the effect profile of the insulin used and can therefore change when changing the treatment scheme .
the substances that increase blood sugar @-@ lowering activity and increase the prop@@ ens@@ ity to hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia belong to oral anti@@ di@@ ab@@ etic , angi@@ ot@@ ens@@ in converting enzyme ( ACE ) inhibit@@ ors , beta @-@ oxid@@ ase ( MA@@ O ) inhibit@@ ors , pent@@ oxi@@ f@@ y@@ ll@@ in , pro@@ po@@ xy@@ ph@@ ene , sal@@ ic@@ yl@@ ates , and sul@@ fon@@ amide antibiotics .
in addition , the effects of sympath@@ e@@ oly@@ tics like beta @-@ block@@ ers , c@@ lon@@ i@@ din , gu@@ an@@ e@@ thi@@ din and reser@@ pine can be weak@@ ened or missing the symptoms of the adren@@ ergi@@ c bac@@ kl@@ ash regulation .
animal experimental studies on reproductive toxic@@ ity showed no differences between in@@ su@@ - ling@@ l@@ ul@@ is@@ in and human insulin in relation to pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , birth or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) .
it is not known whether insulin l@@ ul@@ is@@ ine passes into the human breast milk , but in general insulin neither enters the mother &apos;s milk nor is absorbed after oral application .
listed below are the un@@ desired clinical trials known from clinical trials , group@@ ed by system organ classes and arranged according to decreasing frequency of their occurrence ( very common : ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ; rare : ≥ 1 / 10,000 , &lt; 1 / 1,000 ; very rare : &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) ; not known ( frequency based on the available data ) .
cold welding , cool and pale skin , ti@@ redness , nerv@@ ousness or tre@@ mor , anxiety , unusual exhaus@@ tion or weakness , confusion , concentration problems , di@@ zz@@ iness , excessive y@@ earnings , head@@ ache , nausea and pal@@ pit@@ ations .
li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy If the injection point is continuously changed within the injection area , a li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy can occur at the injection point .
severe hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia with un@@ consciousness can be treated by an intra@@ muscular or sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection of glu@@ c@@ agon ( 0.5 to 1 mg ) , given by an appropriately trained person , or by intra@@ ven@@ ous administration of glucose by a doctor .
after an injection , the patient should be supervised in a hospital to determine the cause of severe hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia and to avoid similar epis@@ odes .
insulin reduces blood sugar levels by stimulating the peripheral glucose intake ( especially skel@@ etal mus@@ cul@@ ature and fat ) as well as the in@@ hibition of glucose production in the liver .
studies with healthy volunteers and patients with diabetes have shown that in sub@@ cut@@ aneous GA@@ - be of insulin l@@ ul@@ is@@ in the impact occurs faster and the active duration is shorter than with normal insulin .
in a study involving 18 male people aged 21 to 50 years with type @-@ 1 diabetes , insulin l@@ ul@@ is@@ in showed a dose of propor@@ tion@@ ate glu@@ cos@@ es@@ cing effect in the therapeu@@ tically relevant dosage range , and at 0.3 E / kg or more a disp@@ rop@@ or@@ tion@@ ate increase in the glu@@ cos@@ es@@ cing effect , just like human@@ insulin .
insulin l@@ ul@@ is@@ in has a double as fast response as normal human insulin and achieves the complete glu@@ cos@@ es@@ cing effect approximately 2 hours earlier than human insulin .
from the data it was apparent that in an application of insulin l@@ ul@@ is@@ in 2 minutes before meal a comparable post@@ pran@@ dial gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic control is reached like with human normal insulin that is given 30 minutes before the meal .
was insulin l@@ ul@@ is@@ in 2 minutes before the meal , a better post@@ pran@@ dial control was achieved than with human normal insulin that was given 2 minutes before the meal .
if insulin l@@ ul@@ is@@ in is applied in 15 minutes after the beginning of the meal , a comparable gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic control as in human normal insulin , which is given 2 r@@ ents before the meal ( see Figure 1 ) , is achieved .
insulin l@@ ul@@ is@@ in at administration 2 minutes ( G@@ LU@@ L@@ IS@@ IN - before ) before beginning of the meal compared to human normal insulin , which was given 30 minutes ( NOR@@ MA@@ L - 30 min . ) before the start of the meal ( Figure 1A ) as well as compared to human normal insulin , which was given 2 minutes ( NOR@@ MA@@ L - before ) before a meal ( Figure 1@@ B ) .
insulin l@@ ul@@ is@@ in at administered 15 minutes ( G@@ LU@@ L@@ IS@@ IN - afterwards ) after the beginning of the meal compared to human normal insulin , which was given 2 minutes ( NOR@@ MA@@ L - before ) before the beginning of the meal ( Figure 1@@ C ) .
