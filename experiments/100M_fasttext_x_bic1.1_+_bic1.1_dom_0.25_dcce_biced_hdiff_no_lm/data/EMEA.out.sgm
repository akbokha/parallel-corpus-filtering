<seg id="1">This document is a summary of the European Public Assessment Report (EPAR), which explains how the Committee for Medicinal Products (CHMP) has assessed the studies carried out to make recommendations regarding the use of the drug.</seg>
<seg id="2">If you need further information about your illness or treatment, please read the package insert (also part of the EPAR) or contact your doctor or pharmacist.</seg>
<seg id="3">If you would like further information on the basis of the CHMP recommendations, please read the scientific discussion (also part of the EPAR).</seg>
<seg id="4">It is available as 5 mg, 10 mg, 15 mg and 30 mg tablets, as 10 mg, 15 mg and 30 mg of melt tablets (tablets that dissolve in the mouth), as a solution for taking (1 mg / ml) and as an injection solution (7.5 mg / ml).</seg>
<seg id="5">B. entertain thinking and speaking, hallucinations (hearing or seeing things that are not present), distrust and delusions; • Bipolar-I disturbance, a mental disorder where patients may have manic episodes (periods of abnormal high spirits) alternately with periods of normal mood.</seg>
<seg id="6">ABILIFY is used to treat moderate to severe manic episodes and to prevent manic episodes in patients who have responded to the medicine in the past.</seg>
<seg id="7">The injection solution is used to quickly control disturbed restlessness or behavioural disorders if the oral intake of the medicine is not possible.</seg>
<seg id="8">In both diseases, the solution to inhalation or the melting tablets in patients can be applied to which the swallowing of tablets causes difficulties.</seg>
<seg id="9">In patients who take other medicines at the same time, which are broken down as well as Abilify, the dose of Abilify should be adjusted.</seg>
<seg id="10">This interferes with the signal transmission between brain cells by "neurotransmitters," i.e. chemical substances that enable communication between nerve cells among each other.</seg>
<seg id="11">Aripiprazol is thought to be "partial agonal" for receptors for neurotransmitters dopamine and 5-hydroxytryptamine (also called serotonin).</seg>
<seg id="12">This means that aripiprazol such as 5-hydroxytryptamine and dopamine, but to a lesser extent, acts as the neurotransmitter to activate the receptors.</seg>
<seg id="13">Since dopamine and 5-hydroxytryptamin play a role in schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, Aripiprazol helps normalize the brain activity, which reduces psychotic or manic symptoms and prevents their reoccurrence.</seg>
<seg id="14">The effectiveness of ABILIFY, the reoccurrence of symptoms, was examined in three studies of up to one year.</seg>
<seg id="15">The efficacy of the injection solution was compared in two studies in 805 patients with schizophrenia or similar diseases which were suffering from increased agitation over a period of two hours with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="16">In another study, Abilify was compared over twelve weeks to 347 patients with haloperidol, in another study the effectiveness of Abilify and placebo to prevent reoccurring to 160 patients in which the manic symptoms had already been stabilised with ABILIFY.</seg>
<seg id="17">The effectiveness of Abilify injection solution was compared in a study involving 301 patients with bipolar disorder, which suffered from increased unrest with which of Lorazepam (another antipsychotic) and placebo over a period of two hours.</seg>
<seg id="18">All studies examined the change in the symptoms of patients using a standard scale for bipolar disorder or the number of patients who responded to the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="19">The company also carried out studies to investigate how the body absorbs the melting tablets and the solution to inhalation.</seg>
<seg id="20">In both studies with the injection solution, patients who received Abilify in doses of 5.25 mg, 9.75 mg or 15 mg showed a significantly stronger reduction in the symptoms of increased restlessness than the patients receiving a placebo.</seg>
<seg id="21">In the application to treat bipolar disorder, Abilify reduced manic symptoms more effectively than placebo in four of the five short-term studies.</seg>
<seg id="22">For up to 74 weeks, ABILIFY prevented the recurrence of manic episodes in previously treated patients and if it was administered in addition to an existing treatment.</seg>
<seg id="23">ABILIFY injections in 10 or 15 mg doses also reduced more effective than placebo the symptoms of increased restlessness and were similarly effective as Lorazepam.</seg>
<seg id="24">The most common side effects of ABILIFY (observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients) are extrapyramidal disturbances (uncontrollable staining), sedation (drowsiness), nausea, vomiting (constipation), saliva (increased saliva), fatigue and exhaustion, restlessness, insomnia (sleep disorders) and anxiety.</seg>
<seg id="25">The Committee for Medicinal Products (CHMP) concluded that the advantages of Abilify in the treatment of schizophrenia and from medium to severe manic episodes in bipolar I disorder and in preventing a new manic episode in patients who spoke mostly manic episodes and in which the manic episodes were responding to the treatment with aripiprazole, compared with the risks.</seg>
<seg id="26">In addition, the committee came to the conclusion that the advantages of the injection solution during rapid control of increased restlessness and behavioural disorders in patients with schizophrenia or in patients with episodes in bipolar I disorder, if oral therapy is not suitable, outweigh the risks.</seg>
<seg id="27">In June 2004, the European Commission granted its approval to the company Otsuka Pharmaceutical Europe Ltd. for the transport of Abilify throughout the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="28">ABILIFY is indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe manic episodes of bipolar disorder and for the prevention of a new manic episode in patients who had mostly manic episodes and their manic episodes responded to the treatment with Aripiprazol (see Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="29">The recommended starting dose for Abilify is 10 or 15 mg / day at a maintenance dose of 15 mg / day once daily regardless of meals.</seg>
<seg id="30">Increased effectiveness in dosages over a daily dose of 15 mg was not proven, although individual patients can benefit from a higher dose.</seg>
<seg id="31">The recommended starting dose for Abilify is 15 mg once daily, irrespective of meals as monotherapy or combination therapy (see Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="32">The effectiveness of Abilify in the treatment of schizophrenia and bipolar disorder in patients ≥ 65 years has not been proven.</seg>
<seg id="33">In consideration of the greater sensitivity of this group of patients, a lower initial dose should be considered when clinical factors justify this (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="34">If the CYP3A4-inductor is removed from the combination therapy, the Aripiprazol dose should be reduced to the recommended dose (see Section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="35">The occurrence of suicidal behavior belongs to psychotic diseases and affective disorders and was reported in some cases after the beginning or after the change of an antipsychotic therapy, also in the treatment with aripiprazol (see section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="36">Results of an epidemiological study showed that in patients with bipolar disorder there was no increased suicidal risk associated with aripiprazole compared to other antipsychotics.</seg>
<seg id="37">Aripiprazol should be used with care in patients with well-known cardiovascular diseases (myocardial infarction or ischemic heart disease, congestive heart failure, hypertension), cerebrovascular disease, hypovolemia, treatment with blood pressure lowering drugs) or hypertension (including acute and malignant form).</seg>
<seg id="38">3 late dyskinesia: in clinical studies lasting one year or less, there were occasional reports of dyskinesia occurring during the treatment with Aripiprazol.</seg>
<seg id="39">If signs and symptoms of late dyskinesia occur in a patient treated with Abilify, it should be considered to reduce the dose or break the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="40">If a patient has developed signs and symptoms that point to a MNS, or unclear high fever without an additional clinical manifestation of MNS, all antipsychotics, including Abilify, must be dismissed.</seg>
<seg id="41">Therefore aripiprazol should be used with caution in patients with seizures in the anamnesis or at states associated with seizures.</seg>
<seg id="42">56 - 99 years) with aripiprazole in patients with psychosis associated with Alzheimer's disease, patients treated with aripiprazole had an increased risk of death compared to placebo.</seg>
<seg id="43">However, there were in one of these studies, a fixed dose study, a significant relationship between the dosage and the response for unwanted cerebrovascular events in patients treated with aripiprazol.</seg>
<seg id="44">Hyperglycemia, in some cases extremely and associated with ketoacidosis or hyperosmolar coma or death, was reported in patients treated with atypical anti-psychotic agents, including Abilify.</seg>
<seg id="45">There are no precise risk assessments for hyperglycemia-related adverse events in patients treated with Abilify and other atypical anti-psychotic drugs to allow direct comparisons.</seg>
<seg id="46">Polyphonic, polyphonic, polyphagia and weakness) are observed and patients with diabetes mellitus or with risk factors for diabetes mellitus should regularly be monitored with regard to a deterioration of glucose levels.</seg>
<seg id="47">Weight gain is generally observed in schizophrenic patients and in patients with bipolar mania due to comorbidities, the use of antipsychotics, in which weight gain is known as a side effect, or an unhealthy lifestyle and could lead to serious complications.</seg>
<seg id="48">Due to the primary effect of aripiprazole on the central nervous system, caution is advised when aripiprazol is taken in combination with alcohol or other central effective medicines with overlapping side effects such as sedation (see paragraph 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="49">The H2-antagonist famotine, a gastric acid blocker, reduces the resorption rate of Aripiprazol, but this effect is not considered clinically relevant.</seg>
<seg id="50">In a clinical study involving healthy volunteers, a highly effective CYP2D6 inhibitor (chinidin) increased the AUC of Aripiprazol by 107% while cmax remained unchanged.</seg>
<seg id="51">It is expected that other highly effective inhibitors of CYP2D6, such as fluoxettin and paroxetine, have similar effects and therefore similar can reductions should be made.</seg>
<seg id="52">CYP2D6 'bad' (poor 'poor') metabolization can result in the joint application with highly effective inhibitors of CYP3A4 in higher plasma concentrations of aripiprazole compared to CYP2D6 extensive metabolisers.</seg>
<seg id="53">Considering the joint administration of ketoconazole or other highly effective CYP3A4 inhibitors with ABILIFY, potential benefits should outweigh the potential risks for the patient.</seg>
<seg id="54">Other highly effective inhibitors of CYP3A4, like itraconazole and HIV proteaseinhibitors, may have similar effects and therefore similar can reductions should be made.</seg>
<seg id="55">After setting up the CYP2D6- or 3A4 inhibitor, the dose of Abilify should be raised to the dose height before the start of the accompanying therapy.</seg>
<seg id="56">Diltiazem or escitalopram) or CYP2D6 together with Abilify can be attributed with a moderate increase in Aripiprazol- concentrations.</seg>
<seg id="57">In clinical studies doses of 10-30 mg Aripiprazole per day showed no significant effect on the metabolism of the substrates of CYP2D6 (dextromethylan / 3-methoxymorphine ratio), 2C9 (warfarin), 2C19 (omephruphorphic).</seg>
<seg id="58">Patients should be advised to inform their doctor if they are pregnant or plan a pregnancy during treatment with aripiprazole.</seg>
<seg id="59">This drug may not be used in pregnancy because of the insufficient data situation in humans and due to the concerns raised in the animal reproductive studies, unless the potential benefit justifies the potential risk for the foetus.</seg>
<seg id="60">However, as with other antipsychotics, patients should be warned of using dangerous machinery, including motor vehicles, until they are certain that Aripiprazol has no negative influence on them.</seg>
<seg id="61">The following side effects were more common (≥ 1 / 100) than placebo or were classified as potential medically relevant side effects (*):</seg>
<seg id="62">The frequency of the side effects listed below is defined by the following criteria: common (&gt; 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 10); occasionally (&gt; 1 / 1.000, &lt; 1 / 100).</seg>
<seg id="63">Schizophrenia - In a controlled long-term study of 52 weeks, patients treated with aripiprazole included a total lower incidence (25.8%) of EPS including parkinsonism, Akathisie, dystonia and dyskinesia, compared to patients treated with haloperidol (57.3%).</seg>
<seg id="64">In a placebo-controlled long-term study for 26 weeks, the incidence of EPS grew 19% in patients under aripiprazole treatment and 13.1% in patients under placebo.</seg>
<seg id="65">In another controlled long-term study over 26 weeks, the incidence of EPS 14.8% in patients treated with aripiprazole was 15.1% in patients with aplanapine therapy.</seg>
<seg id="66">Manic episodes in bipolar I disorder - In a controlled study of 12 weeks, the incidence of EPS 23,5% in patients under aripiprazol- treatment and 53.3% in patients with haloperidol treatment.</seg>
<seg id="67">In another study over 12 weeks, the incidence of EPS 26.6% in patients with aripiprazole treatment and 17.6% for those under lithium treatment.</seg>
<seg id="68">In the long-term maintenance phase for 26 weeks in a placebo-controlled trial, the incidence of EPS 18.2% for patients under aripiprazol- treatment and 15.7% for patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="69">A comparison between the patient groups under aripiprazole and placebo, in which potential clinically significant changes of routine laboratory parameters were detected, did not show any medically significant differences.</seg>
<seg id="70">Increases in CPK (creatine-phosphokinase), generally temporary and asymptomatic, were observed in 3.5% of patients treated with aripiprazol, compared to 2.0% of patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="71">The side effects associated with an antipsychotic therapy and their occurrence in the treatment with Aripiprazol include malignant neuroleptic syndrome, late dyskinesia and varicose cases, unwanted cerebrovascular events and increased mortality in older dementia patients, hyperglycemia and diabetes mellitus (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="72">In clinical trials and since the market launch inadvertently or intentionally acute overdosages with aripiprazole alone were observed in adult patients with estimated doses of up to 1260 mg and without death.</seg>
<seg id="73">Although there are no information on the efficacy of a hemodialysis in the treatment of an overdose with aripiprazole; however, it is unlikely that hemodialysis is beneficial in the treatment of overdosing, as Aripiprazol has a high plasma protein connection.</seg>
<seg id="74">It is thought that the efficacy of aripiprazole in schizophrenia and bipolar I disorder is mediated by the combination of a partial antagonistic effect on dopamine D2- and serotonin 5HT1a- receptors and an antagonistic effect on serotonin 5HT2a receptors.</seg>
<seg id="75">Aripiprazol showed in vitro a high affinity to the dopamine D2- and D3-receptor and to the serotonin 5HT1a- and 5HT2a-receptor as well as a moderate affinity to dopamine D4-, for serotonin 5HT2c- and 5HT7-, to alpha-1-adrenergic and to the histamine-H1receptor.</seg>
<seg id="76">The positron emission tomography showed dose-dependent reduction of binding of 11C-Racloprid, a D2 / D3-receptor ligands, the nucleus caudatus and the putamen for a dose of aripiprazol in dosages of 0.5 to 30 mg. once a day for more than 2 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="77">In three placebo-controlled short-term studies (4 to 6 weeks) on 1,228 schizophrenic patients with positive or negative symptoms, Aripiprazole showed a statistically significant improvement in psychotic symptoms compared to placebo.</seg>
<seg id="78">In a haloperidol-controlled trial, 52% of responder patients who attended study medication in week 52 were similar in both groups (Aripiprazol 77% and haloperidol 73%).</seg>
<seg id="79">Current values from measuring scales which were defined as secondary study objectives including PANSS and Montgomery Asberg- Depressions Rates showed a significantly stronger improvement than with haloperidol.</seg>
<seg id="80">In a placebo-controlled study over 26 weeks in stabilized patients with chronic schizophrenia, a significantly higher rate of recall rate was seen in Aripiprazole, which was 34% in the Aripiprazole group and 57% in the placebo.</seg>
<seg id="81">In a pseudo-controlled, multinational double-blind study in schizophrenia over 26 weeks involving 314 patients and in which the primary study goal was' weight gain ', a significant reduction in weight gain of at least 7% compared to the initial value (i.e. an increase of at least 5.6 kg) with an average weight of ca.</seg>
<seg id="82">In two placebo-controlled monotherapy studies with flexible dosage over 3 weeks with patients with a manic or mixed episode of bipolar I disorder, Aripiprazol showed a superior efficacy compared to placebo in reducing manic symptoms over 3 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="83">In a placebo-controlled monotherapy trial over 3 weeks with fixed dosage with patients with a manic or mixed episode of bipolar I disorder, Aripiprazole showed no superior efficacy compared to placebo.</seg>
<seg id="84">In two placebo and active-controlled monotherapy studies for 12 weeks in patients with a manic or mixed episode of a bipolar I disorder, with or without psychotic features, Aripiprazol showed an efficacy compared to placebo in week 3 and a maintenance effect comparable to that of lithium or haloperidol in week 12.</seg>
<seg id="85">Aripiprazole also showed in week 12 a comparable proportion of patients with symptomatic remission of the mania like lithium or haloperidol.</seg>
<seg id="86">In a placebo-controlled study for 6 weeks with patients with a manic or mixed episode of a bipolar-I disorder, with or without psychotic features, which partly did not apply to lithium or valproat monotherapy in therapeutic serum mirrors, the companion therapy with aripiprazole revealed an superior effectiveness in reducing manic symptoms compared to monotherapy involving lithium or valproat.</seg>
<seg id="87">10 In a placebo-controlled study over 26 weeks followed by a long-term enlargement phase for more than 74 weeks in manic patients who had achieved a remission with aripiprazole during a stabilisation period prior to randomisation, Aripiprazole was superior to the prevention of a bipolar return, predominantly in the prevention of a reversal in the mania.</seg>
<seg id="88">Based on in vitro studies, the CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 enzymes are responsible for the dehydration and hydroxyomation of aripiprazol, the N-Dealkyrie is catalysed by CYP3A4.</seg>
<seg id="89">The mean phase of elimination is approximately 75 hours for aripiprazole with extensive metabolites via CYP2D6 and approximately 146 hours in poor 'poor' (poor ') metabolism agents using CYP2D6.</seg>
<seg id="90">In aripiprazole there are no differences in pharmacokinetics between male and female healthy subjects, as did pharmacokinetic examination of schizophrenic patients with no gender dependent effects.</seg>
<seg id="91">A selection-specific evaluation for pharmacokinetics did not reveal any clinically significant differences with respect to ethnicity's ethnicity or the effect of smoking on the pharmacokinetics of Aripiprazol.</seg>
<seg id="92">The pharmacokinetic properties of Aripiprazol and Dehydro-Aripiprazol were similar in patients with severe renal insufficiency compared to young healthy volunteers.</seg>
<seg id="93">A single dose study in patients with different liver cirrhosis (Child-Pugh Class A, B and C) showed no significant effect regarding the impairment of liver function on the pharmacokinetics of Aripiprazole and Dehydro-Aripiprazol, but the study included only 3 patients with class C cirrhosis, which is not sufficient to draw conclusions on their metabolic capacity.</seg>
<seg id="94">Based on conventional studies on safety harmacology, toxicity with repeated application, reproduction toxicity, genotoxicity, and the kandicated potential, the preclinical data had no particular dangers to humans.</seg>
<seg id="95">Toxicologically significant effects were only observed in dosages or expositions that significantly exceeded the maximum dose or exposure in humans, so that they have limited or no importance for clinical application.</seg>
<seg id="96">The effects included a dose-dependent side kidney toxicity (lipofuscin-pigment-accumulation and / or parenchymal cell loss) in rats after 104 weeks at the recommended maximum dose in humans) and an increase in adrenal rinder-carcinomas / carcinomas in female rats at 60 mg / kg / day (10 times the average steady state exposure (AUC) at the recommended maximum dose in humans).</seg>
<seg id="97">In addition, a cholelithiasis was determined as a result of the precipitation of sulphate conjugates of the hydroxy- Metabolites of Aripiprazol in the bile of 25 to 125 mg / kg / day (1 to 3 times the average steady state exposure (AUC) at the recommended clinical dose or the 16- to 81times the recommended maximum dose in humans based on mg / m2).</seg>
<seg id="98">However, at the highest recommended daily dose of 30 mg. of the sulphate conjugates of hydroxy- aripiprazol, the concentrations found in the human bile were no more than 6% of the concentrations found in the study for 39 weeks in the bile of monkeys, and lie far below the limit values (6%) of the in vitro solubility.</seg>
<seg id="99">In rabbits, these effects were observed after dosages leading to expositions of 3 and 11 times the average steady state AUC at the recommended clinical maximum dose.</seg>

<seg id="143">ABILIFY injection solution is used for fast control of agility and behavioural disorders in patients with schizophrenia or in patients with episodes of bipolar I disorder if oral therapy is not appropriate.</seg>
<seg id="144">As soon as it is clinically attached, the treatment with Aripiprazol injection solution should be terminated and begun with the oral application of Aripiprazol.</seg>
<seg id="145">To increase resorption and minimise variability, an injection into the M. Deltoideus or deep into the gluteus maximus muscle is recommended under circumventing adipous regions.</seg>
<seg id="146">A lower dose of 5.25 mg (0.7 ml) may be given depending on the individual clinical status taking into account the medicines currently used for maintenance or acute therapy (see Section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="147">If an additional oral treatment with Aripiprazol is indicated, see the summary of the characteristics of the drug to Abilify tablets, Abilify Melting tablets or Abilify solution to intake.</seg>
<seg id="148">There are no studies on the efficacy of aripiprazol injection-solution in patients with agility and behavioural disturbances caused differently than by schizophrenia and manic episodes of bipolar I disorder.</seg>
<seg id="149">If parenteral therapy with benzodiazepines is considered necessary in addition to aripiprazol injection, patients should be observed with regard to extreme sedation or blood pressure loss (see Section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="150">Studies on the safety and efficacy of aripiprazol injection solution are not available to patients with alcohol or drug poisoning (prescribed or illegal drugs).</seg>
<seg id="151">Aripiprazol should be used with care in patients with well-known cardiovascular diseases (myocardial infarction or ischemic heart disease, congestive heart failure, hypertension), cerebrovascular disease, hypovolemia, treatment with blood pressure lowering drugs) or hypertension (including acute and malignant form).</seg>
<seg id="152">Late dyskinesia: in clinical studies lasting one year or less, there were occasional reports of dyskinesia occurring during the treatment with aripiprazol.</seg>
<seg id="153">Clinical manifestations of a MNS are high fever, stiffness, changing consciousness levels and signs of autonomous instability (irregular pulse or blood pressure, tachycardia, sweating and cardiac arrhythmia).</seg>

<seg id="155">A weight gain is generally observed in schizophrenic patients and patients with bipolar mania because of comorbidities, the use of antipsychotics, in which weight gain is known as a side effect or an unhealthy lifestyle and could lead to serious complications.</seg>
<seg id="156">Nevertheless, the intensity of the sedation was greater compared to that after allotted of Aripiprazol, in a study where healthy volunteers received Aripiprazol (15 mg dose) as one-off intramuscularly and which at the same time received Lorazepam (2 mg dose) intramuscular.</seg>
<seg id="157">105 The H2-antagonist famotidine, a gastric acid blocker, reduces the resorption rate of Aripiprazol, but this effect is not considered clinically relevant.</seg>
<seg id="158">In CYP2D6 'bad' ('poor') metabolism agents, the common application with highly effective inhibitors of CYP3A4 can result in higher plasma concentrations of aripiprazole compared to CYP2D6 extensioners.</seg>
<seg id="159">Other highly effective inhibitors of CYP3A4, like Itraconazole and HIV- proteaseinhibitors, may have similar effects and therefore similar can reductions should be made.</seg>
<seg id="160">After setting up the CYP2D6- or 3A4 inhibitor, the dose of Abilify should be raised to the dose height before the start of the accompanying therapy.</seg>
<seg id="161">106 Lorazepam (2 mg dose) intramuscularly received, the intensity of the sedation was greater compared to the after sole gift of Aripiprazol.</seg>
<seg id="162">The following side effects were more common in clinical trials with Aripiprazol injection solution more frequently (≥ 1 / 100) than placebo or were classified as potential medically relevant side effects (*) (see Section 5.1):</seg>
<seg id="163">The frequency of the side effects listed below is defined according to the following criteria: common (≥ 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 10); occasionally (≥ 1 / 1.000, &lt; 1 / 100).</seg>
<seg id="164">107 The following side effects were more common (≥ 1 / 100) than placebo or were classified as potential medically relevant side effects (*) in clinical studies (see section 5.1):</seg>
<seg id="165">In a placebo-controlled long-term study for 26 weeks, the incidence of EPS was 19% in patients under aripiprazol- treatment and 13.1% in patients under placebo.</seg>
<seg id="166">In another study of 12 weeks, the incidence of EPS 26.6% in patients under aripiprazol- treatment and 17.6% for those under lithium treatment.</seg>
<seg id="167">In the long-term maintenance phase for 26 weeks in a placebo-controlled trial, the incidence of EPS 18.2% for patients under aripiprazole was 15.7% for patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="168">A comparison between the patient groups under aripiprazole and placebo, in which potential clinically significant changes of routine laboratory parameters were detected, did not show any medically significant differences.</seg>
<seg id="169">Increases in CPK (keratinphosphokinase), generally temporary and asymptomatic, were observed in 3.5% of patients treated with aripiprazol, compared to 2.0% of patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="170">The side effects associated with an antipsychotic therapy and their occurrence in the treatment with Aripiprazol include malignant neuroleptic syndrome, late dyskinesia and varicose seizures, unwanted cerebrovascular events and increased mortality in older dementia patients, hyperglycemia and diabetes mellitus (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="171">110 and behavioural disorders was the Aripiprazol injection solution with statistically significant greater improvements of agility / behavioural related compared to placebo and was similar to Haloperidol.</seg>
<seg id="172">In a placebo-controlled short-term study (24 h) with 291 patients with bipolar disorder as well as agility and behavioural disorders, the Aripiprazol injection solution was associated with a statistically significant improvement in the symptoms regarding agility and behavioural disorders compared to placebo and similar to the Lorazepam- reference arm.</seg>
<seg id="173">The median improvement of the baseline measured at the PANSS Excitement Component score was 5.8 for placebo, 9.6 for Lorazepam and 8.7 for Aripiprazole.</seg>
<seg id="174">In analyses of sub-groups in patients with mixed episodes or patients with severe agility, a similar effectiveness has been observed with regard to the overall population, but a statistical significance could be determined by a reduced number of patients.</seg>
<seg id="175">In three placebo-controlled short-term studies (4 to 6 weeks) at 1,228 schizophrenic patients with positive or negative symptoms, Aripiprazole (oral) showed a statistically significant improvement in psychotic symptoms compared to placebo.</seg>
<seg id="176">In a haloperidol-controlled trial, 52% of responder patients attending the study medication were similar in both groups (Aripiprazol 77% (oral) and haloperidol 73%) in week 52.</seg>
<seg id="177">Current values from measuring scales defined as secondary study objectives including PANSS and Montgomery-Asberg Depressions Rates showed a significantly stronger improvement than at Haloperidol.</seg>
<seg id="178">In a placebo-controlled study for more than 26 weeks in stabilized patients with chronic schizophrenia, a significantly higher rate of recall rate was seen in Aripiprazole (oral), which was 34% in the Aripiprazol- (oral) group and 57% in placebo.</seg>
<seg id="179">In a pseudo-controlled, multinational double-blind study in schizophrenia over 26 weeks, which included 314 patients and in which the primary study goal was' weight gain ', significantly fewer patients showed a weight gain of at least 7% compared to the initial value (i.e. an increase of at least 5.6 kg with an average weight of ca.</seg>
<seg id="180">111 In a placebo-controlled study for 6 weeks with patients with a manic or mixed episode of a bipolar-I disorder, with or without psychotic features, which partly did not apply to lithium or valproat monotherapy in therapeutic serum mirrors, the companion therapy with aripiprazole revealed an superior effectiveness in reducing manic symptoms compared to monotherapy involving lithium or valproat.</seg>
<seg id="181">In a placebo-controlled study for 26 weeks followed by a 74 week study extension for manic patients who had achieved a remission with aripiprazole during a stabilisation period prior to randomisation, Aripiprazole was superior to placebo in regard to the prevention of a bipolar return, predominantly in the prevention of a reversal in the mania.</seg>
<seg id="182">In the first 2 hours following intramuscular injection, the aripiprazole AUC was 90% larger than the AUC after dosing of the same dose as a tablet; systemic exposure was similar between the two formulations.</seg>
<seg id="183">In 2 studies involving healthy volunteers, the average time until reaching the maximum plasma level was 1 to 3 hours after application.</seg>
<seg id="184">The gift of Aripiprazol injection solution was well tolerated by rats and monkeys and resulted in no direct toxicity of a target organ after repeated application during systemic exposure (AUC), which was 15 or 5 times higher than the maximum human therapeutical exposure of 30 mg intramuscularly.</seg>
<seg id="185">In studies on reproductive toxicity after intravenous application, no safety-related concerns after maternal exposure, which was 15 - (rats) and 29 times (rabbits) over the maximum humantherapeutic exposure of 30 mg.</seg>
<seg id="186">Based on conventional studies with Aripiprazol (oral) for safety harmacology, toxicity with repeated application, reproduction toxicity, genotoxicity, and the kandicated potential, the preclinical data could not identify any particular dangers to humans.</seg>
<seg id="187">Toxicologically significant effects were only observed in dosages or expositions that significantly exceeded the maximum dose or exposure to humans; therefore, they have limited or no importance for clinical application.</seg>
<seg id="188">The effects included a dose-dependent side nipple toxiciousness (lipofuscin-pigment-accumulation and / or parenchymal cell loss) in rats after 104 weeks at the recommended maximum dosage at 60 mg / kg / day (the 10 times the mean steady-state exposure (AUC) at the recommended maximum dose in humans).</seg>
<seg id="189">In addition, a cholelithiasis was determined as a result of the precipitation of sulphate conjugates of the hydroxy- Metabolites of Aripiprazol in the Galle from 25 to 125 mg / kg / day (1 to 3 times the recommended clinical dose or the 16- to 81 times the recommended maximum dose in humans based on mg / m2).</seg>

<seg id="267">The efficacy of Abraxane was investigated in a major study involving 460 women with metastatic breast cancer, of which around three quarters had previously received an anthracycline.</seg>
<seg id="268">The effect of Abraxane (in sole gift or as a monotherapy) was compared with the drug containing a conventional paclitaxel (given in combination with other medicines to reduce the side effects).</seg>
<seg id="269">Overall, in the main study 72 (31%) 229 patients treated with Abraxane were treated to treatment, compared to 37 (16%) of the 225 patients receiving conventional paclitaxel compounds.</seg>
<seg id="270">If only the patients who were first treated for metastatic breast cancer, there was no difference between the drugs in terms of efficacy indicators such as time to deteriorating disease and survival.</seg>
<seg id="271">In contrast, patients who had previously received other metastatic breast cancer treatments showed that Abraxane was more effective than conventional paclitaxel.</seg>
<seg id="272">It may also not be used in patients who have low neutrophils in the blood prior to treatment.</seg>
<seg id="273">The Committee for Medicinal Products (CHMP) found that Abraxane was more effective in patients in which the first treatment was not more effective than conventional paclitaxel contained drugs and that it does not have to be given with other medicines in contrast to other paclitaxel drugs to reduce side effects.</seg>
<seg id="274">In January 2008, the European Commission granted the company Abraxis BioScience Limited an approval for the placing of Abraxane in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="275">Abraxane monotherapy is indicated for the treatment of metastatic breast cancer in patients with first-line metastatic disease and for which a standard anthracycline contained therapy is not indicated (see also section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="276">In patients with severe neutropenia (neutrophils &lt; 0,50 x 109 / l over a period of one week or longer) or serious sensory neuropathy during the Abraxane therapy, the dose should be reduced to 220 mg / m2 in subsequent series.</seg>
<seg id="277">In sensorial neuropathy Grade 3 the treatment is to interrupt until an improvement is reached at grade 1 or 2, and in all subsequent cycles the dose must be reduced.</seg>
<seg id="278">There are currently no sufficient data for the recommendation of dose adjustments in patients with slight to moderate impairment of liver function (see Section 4.4. and 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="279">No studies with patients with impaired renal function were carried out and there are currently no adequate data on the recommendation of dose adjustments in patients with impairment of kidney function (see Section 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="280">Abraxane is not recommended for use in children under 18 years of age due to insufficient data on safety and efficacy.</seg>
<seg id="281">Abraxane is a albumin-linked nanoparticle formulation of paclitaxel, which could have considerably more pharmacological characteristics than other formulations of paclitaxel (see Section 5.1 and 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="282">If an allergic reaction occurs, the medicine should be removed immediately and a symptomatic treatment should be initiated and the patient must not be treated with paclitaxel again.</seg>
<seg id="283">In patients, no renewed abrasion cycles should be initiated until neutrophils increased to &gt; 1.5 x 109 / l and the thrombocyte value is increased to &gt; 100 x 109 / l.</seg>
<seg id="284">Patients with severe liver dysfunction (bilirubin &gt; 5 x ULN or ASL / ALT &gt; 10 x ULN) should not be treated with Abraxane.</seg>
<seg id="285">While a unique cardiotoxicity related to abrasion was unproven, cardiac occurrences in the indicated patient population are not unusual, especially in patients with early anthracycline treatment or underlying heart or lung disease.</seg>
<seg id="286">If nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea occur in patients after the treatment of Abraxane, they can be treated with the usual antiemetic and constipating methods.</seg>
<seg id="287">Abraxane should not be used in pregnant women or women in childbearing age that do not have effective contraception, unless the treatment of the mother with paclitaxel is inevitable.</seg>
<seg id="288">Women of childbearing age should use a reliable contraceptive method during and up to 1 month after treatment with Abraxane.</seg>
<seg id="289">Male patients treated with Abraxane are advised to not produce a child during and up to six months after treatment.</seg>
<seg id="290">Male patients should be advised of a sperm conservation before treatment, because the therapy with Abraxane is the possibility of irreversible infertility.</seg>
<seg id="291">Abraxane can cause side effects such as fatigue (very common) and dizziness (frequent) which can affect the traffic tightness and the ability to operate machinery.</seg>
<seg id="292">The following are the most common and major incidents of side effects that occurred in 229 patients with metastatic breast cancer who were treated with 260 mg / m2 of abraxane every three weeks at the pivotalen clinical phase III trial.</seg>
<seg id="293">Neutropenia was the most conspicuous hematological toxicity (reported in 79% of patients) and was rapidly reversible and dose-dependent; leukopenia was reported in 71% of patients.</seg>
<seg id="294">Anemia (Hb &lt; 10 g / dl) was observed in 46% of patients treated with Abraxane and was severe in three cases (Hb &lt; 8 g / dl).</seg>
<seg id="295">Table 1 shows the side effects associated with the administration of Abraxane as monotherapy at each dose and indication in studies (N = 789).</seg>
<seg id="296">Very common (≥ 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 10); occasionally (≥ 1 / 1,000, &lt; 1 / 100); rare (≥ 1 / 10,000, &lt; 1 / 1,000); very rare (&lt; 1 / 10.000).</seg>
<seg id="297">Occasionally: increased blood pressure, weight gain, increased lactic dehydrogenase in the blood, increased blood sugar, increased phosphorus in the blood, reduced potassium in the blood of heart disease:</seg>
<seg id="298">Dysphagia, bloating, tongue burning, dry mouth, pain of teeth, loose stools, oesophagitis, pain in the abdominal, ulcers in the mouth, oral pain, rectal bleeding disorders of the kidneys and urinary tract:</seg>
<seg id="299">Pain in chest wall, weakness of muscles, neck pain, abdominal pain, muscle spasms, pain in skeletal musculature, backlash, discomfort in limbs, muscle weakness Very frequent:</seg>
<seg id="300">Restlessness 1 The frequency of hypersensitivity reactions is calculated based on a definitive in the related case in a population of 789 patients</seg>
<seg id="301">Since these events were reported on a voluntary basis during clinical practice, no estimates of the actual frequency are possible and no causal connection with these events has been established.</seg>
<seg id="302">Paclitaxel is an anti-microtubules drug that promotes the interrelocation of the microtubules from the tubular Indians and stabilizes the microtubules by blocking their landolymerization.</seg>
<seg id="303">This stabilization leads to an inhibition of the normal dynamic reorganisation of the microtubular network, which is essential for the vital interphase and the mitotic cell functions.</seg>
<seg id="304">It is known that albumin mediates the transcytosis of plasma components into the endothelial cells and in the context of in-vitro studies it has been demonstrated that the presence of albumin promotes the transport of paclitaxel through endothelial cells.</seg>
<seg id="305">It is assumed that this improved transendopiale transport is mediated by the gp-60 albuminreeptor and due to the albuminating protein SPARC (eclipted protein acidic rich in cysteine) a paclitaxel accumulation occurs in the tumor area.</seg>
<seg id="306">The application of Abraxane for metastatic breast cancer is supported by 106 patients in two single-arm unlinked studies and of 454 patients treated in a randomised Phase III trial study.</seg>
<seg id="307">In one study, 43 patients with metastatic breast cancer were treated with Abraxane, which was given in the form of an infusion for 30 minutes with a dose of 175 mg / m2.</seg>
<seg id="308">In the second study, a dose of 300 mg / m2 was used as an infusion of over 30 minutes to 63 patients with metastatic breast cancer.</seg>
<seg id="309">This multicenter study was performed in patients with metastatic breast cancer, which received a monotherapy with paclitaxel every 3 weeks, either in the form of solvent containing paclitaxel 175 mg / m2, or in the form of abrasion of 260 mg / m2 as a 30-minute infusion without premedication (N = 229).</seg>
<seg id="310">In the study, 64% of patients had a impaired general condition (ECOG 1 or 2), 79% had visceral metastases and 76% had more than 3 metastases.</seg>
<seg id="311">14% of patients had previously received no chemotherapy; 27% had only one adjuvant chemotherapy, 40% only for metastatic disease and 19% because of metastatic disease and adjuvant treatment.</seg>
<seg id="312">9 The results for the general response rate and time to progression-free survival and progression-free survival and survival for patients who receive first-line therapy are shown below.</seg>
<seg id="313">Neurotoxicity compared to paclitaxel was evaluated by the improvement of a degree for patients who experienced a peripheral neuropathy Grade 3 at a time during therapy.</seg>
<seg id="314">The natural course of peripheral neuropathy towards baseline due to the cumulative toxicity of Abraxane after &gt; 6 treatment courses has not been evaluated and remains unknown.</seg>
<seg id="315">The pharmacokinetics of the total paclitaxel after 30- and 180-minute treatments of Abraxane with a dose of 80 to 375 mg / m2 was determined in clinical studies.</seg>
<seg id="316">The active substance exposure (AUC) increased linearly from 2653 to 16736 ng.h / ml, analogous to a dose of 80 to 300 mg / m2.</seg>
<seg id="317">10 Following an intravenous dose of Abraxane in patients with metastatic breast cancer in the recommended clinical dose of 260 mg / m2, the paclitaxel plasma concentration decreased in a multiphase manner.</seg>
<seg id="318">The medium distribution volume amounted to 632 l / m2; the high distribution volume points to an extensive extravascularious distribution and / or soft tissue linking of paclitaxel.</seg>
<seg id="319">In a study involving advanced solid tumours the pharmacokinetic properties of paclitaxel were compared with intravenous 30-minute infusion of 260 mg / m2 of abraxane compared with a 3-hour injection of 175 mg / m2 of solvent containing paclitaxel.</seg>
<seg id="320">The clearance of paclitaxel was higher (43%) than after a solvent containing paclitaxel injection, and the distribution volume was higher at Abraxane (53%).</seg>
<seg id="321">In published literature about in-vitro studies of human liver microsome and tissue histories, it is reported that paclitaxel is metabolized primarily to 6α -hydroxypaclitaxel and to two smaller metabolites (3 "-p-hydroxypaclitaxel and 6α--3" -p-dihydroxypaclitaxel).</seg>
<seg id="322">After a 30-minute infusion of 260 mg / m2 of abraxane in patients with metastatic breast cancer, the mean value for cumulative urinary excretion of the unchanged total dose with less than 1% of the metabolites 6α -hydroxypaclitaxel and 3 "-p-hydroxypaclitaxel, leading to a far-reaching non-renal clearance.</seg>
<seg id="323">However, only a few data is available for patients at the age of 75, since only 3 patients of this age group participated in the pharmacokinetic analysis.</seg>
<seg id="324">Chemical and physical stability was detected at 2 ° C - 8 ° C in original box and in light light over 8 hours.</seg>
<seg id="325">Paclitaxel is a cytotoxic anticarcinogenic drug and, as well as other potentially toxic substances, should be treated with abrasion.</seg>
<seg id="326">Using a sterile syringe, over a period of at least 1 minute 20 ml of a 9 mg / ml (0.9%) sodium chloride infusion solution is injected into a abrasion bottle.</seg>

<seg id="358">• Training brochure • Summary of the characteristics of the medicine (specialist information), labelling and package inserts. • With unique visual representation of the correct application of the product provided cooling boxes for transport through the patients.</seg>
<seg id="359">This means that Abseamed is similar to a biological medicine approved in the European Union (EU) and contains the same ingredient (also called "reference medicinal products").</seg>
<seg id="360">It is used in patients with normal blood-iron values, in which complications may arise in connection with blood transfusion, if blood circulation is not possible before the procedure and a blood loss of 900 to 1 800 ml is to be expected.</seg>
<seg id="361">The treatment with Abseamed must be initiated under the supervision of a doctor who has experience in the treatment of patients with diseases for which the medicine is indicated.</seg>
<seg id="362">In patients with kidney problems and in patients who want to make a blood donation, Abseamed is injected into a vein.</seg>
<seg id="363">The injections can also be made by the patient or his supervisor, provided they have received an appropriate instruction.</seg>
<seg id="364">In patients with chronic renal insufficiency or in patients receiving chemotherapy, the haemoglobin values should always be in the recommended range (between 10 and 12 grams per deciliter in adults and between 9.5 and 11 g / dl in children).</seg>
<seg id="365">The iron values of all patients must be checked before treatment to ensure that no iron deficiency exists, and iron supplements should be administered throughout the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="366">In patients receiving chemotherapy, or in patients with kidney problems, anaemia may be caused by an erythropoietine deficiency, or that the body does not respond adequately to the body's erythropoietin.</seg>
<seg id="367">Erythropoietin is also used before surgery to increase the number of red blood cells and thus reduce the consequences of blood loss.</seg>
<seg id="368">It is produced by a cell in which a gene (DNA) was introduced, which it enables the formation of epoetin alfa.</seg>
<seg id="369">When administered as an injection, Abseamed was compared to a major study involving 479 patients suffering from anemia caused by kidney problems and compared with the reference medicinal product.</seg>
<seg id="370">All patients participating in this study were injected Eprex / Erypo in a vein for at least eight weeks before either renamed or continued to receive Eprex / Erypo.</seg>
<seg id="371">The main indicator for efficacy was the change in hemoglobin values between the beginning of the study and the assessment period in the weeks 25 to 29.</seg>
<seg id="372">The company also presented the results of a study in which the effects of flamed Abseamed with those of Eprex / Erypo were studied in 114 cancer patients receiving chemotherapy.</seg>
<seg id="373">In the study with patients suffering from anemia caused by kidney problems, the hemoglobin values of patients who were converted to Abseamed were kept in the same measure as those received by Eprex / Erypo.</seg>
<seg id="374">In comparison, patients who continue to receive Eprex / Erypo showed an increase of 0.063 g / dl of the initial value of 12.0 g / dl.</seg>
<seg id="375">The most common side effect of Abseamed is an increase in blood pressure, which may occasionally lead to symptoms of encephalopathy (brain problems) such as sudden, piercing migraine headaches and confusion.</seg>
<seg id="376">Abseamed may not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to epoetin alfa or any of the other ingredients.</seg>
<seg id="377">Abseamed as an injection under the skin is not recommended for treating kidney problems as further studies are required to ensure that this does not trigger allergic reactions.</seg>
<seg id="378">The Committee for Medicinal Products (CHMP) concluded that a comparable quality, safety and efficacy profile such as Eprex / Erypo has been shown for Abseamed according to the European Union regulations.</seg>
<seg id="379">The company that produces Abseamed will provide information packages for the medical professionals in all Member States, including information on the safety of the medicine.</seg>
<seg id="380">In August 2007, the European Commission granted approval to the company Medice Medicines Pütter GmbH & Co. kg for the placing of Abseamed across the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="381">Treatment of anaemia and reduction of transfusion needs in adults with solid tumours, malignant lymphoma or multiplem myeloma who receive chemotherapy and in which there is a risk of transfusion due to the general condition (for example cardiovascular status, preexisting anemia at the beginning of chemotherapy).</seg>
<seg id="382">The treatment should be performed only in patients with moderate anemia (haemoglobin [Hb] 10 - 13 g / dl [6.2 - 8.1 mmol / l], if blood-saving measures are not available or inadequate, in case of planned larger surgical procedures, which require a large volume of blood (4 or more blood in women; 5 or more units of blood in men).</seg>
<seg id="383">To reduce foreign blood, Abseamed can be used in front of a large elective orthopaedic intervention in adults without iron deficiency, in which high risk of transfusion complications is to be expected.</seg>
<seg id="384">HB 10-13 g / dl) and an expected blood loss of 900-1800 ml, which can not take part in an autologous blood donation program.</seg>
<seg id="385">The hemoglobin target concentration is between 10 and 12 g / dl (6.2 - 7.5 mmol / l), except for pediatric patients, where the hemoglobin concentration should lie between 9,5 and 11 g / dl (5.9 - 6,8 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="386">Symptoms of anemia and symptoms may vary depending on age, sex and total disease; therefore, the evaluation of the individual clinical course and conditions of illness by the physician is necessary.</seg>
<seg id="387">A rise in hemoglobin by more than 2 g / dl (1.25 mmol / l) over a period of four weeks should be avoided.</seg>
<seg id="388">Due to the variability between patients, individual hemoglobin values can occasionally be observed in a patient or under the haemoglobin target concentration.</seg>
<seg id="389">In light of this haemoglobin variability, a corresponding dose management should be tried to reach the hemoglobin target concentration of 10 g / dl (6.2mmol / l) up to 12 g / dl (7.5 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="390">If the haemoglobin value increases by more than 2 g / dl (1.25 mmol / l) per month or if the persistent haemoglobin exceeds 12 g / dl (7.5 mmol / l), the epic-alfa dose is reduced by 25%.</seg>
<seg id="391">Patients should be closely monitored to ensure that epoetin alfa is used in the lowest approved dose which is required for the control of anaemia and anemia symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="392">The clinical results suggest that patients with very low Hb value (&lt; 6 g / dl or &lt; 3.75 mmol / l) may need higher conservation doses than patients in which initial anaemia is less pronounced (Hb &gt; 8 g / dl or &gt; 5 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="393">The clinical results suggest that patients with very low Hb value (&lt; 6.8 g / dl or &lt; 4.25 mmol / l) may need higher conservation doses than patients in which initial anaemia is less pronounced (Hb &gt; 6.8 g / dl or &gt; 4,25 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="394">Starting dose 50 I.U. / kg three times a week by intravenous application, if necessary with an increase in dose of 25 I.U. / kg (three times a week) until the desired target value is reached (this should be done in steps of at least 4 weeks).</seg>
<seg id="395">Symptoms of anemia and sequelae may vary depending on age, sex and total disease; therefore, the evaluation of the individual clinical course and conditions of illness by the physician is necessary.</seg>
<seg id="396">In light of this haemoglobin variability, a corresponding dose management should be tried to reach the hemoglobin target concentration of 10 g / dl (6.2mmol / l) up to 12 g / dl (7.5 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="397">Patients should be closely monitored to ensure that epoetin alfa is used in the lowest approved dose which is required to control the anemia symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="398">If the haemoglobin value is increased by at least 1 g / dl (0.62 mmol / l) or the number of reticulosis by ≥ 40.000 cells / µl compared to the initial value, the dose should be maintained three times a week or 450 I.U. / kg once a week.</seg>
<seg id="399">If the haemoglobin rise &lt; 1 g / dl (&lt; 0,62 mmol / l) and the Reticulocyte value has increased to &lt; 40.000 cells / µl, the dose should be increased to 300 I.U. / kg three times a week.</seg>
<seg id="400">In case of further 4 weeks of treatment with 300 I.U. / kg three times a week of haemoglobin value ≥ 1 g / dl (≥ 0.62 mmol / l) or the bacterial counts of ≥ 40.000 cells / µl should be maintained three times a week.</seg>
<seg id="401">In contrast, the haemoglobin value of &lt; 1 g / dl (&lt; 0,62 mmol / l) or the number of Reticulozytes increased by &lt; 40.000 cells / µl compared to the initial value, is an indication of the epic-alfa treatment unlikely and the treatment should be canceled.</seg>
<seg id="402">Patients with mild anaemia (haematocrit 33 - 39%), in which the precautionary storage of ≥ 4 blood contours is required, should be obtained in a dose of 600 I.U. / kg body weight twice a week for 3 weeks prior to surgery.</seg>
<seg id="403">Iron substitution should begin as early as possible, for example a few weeks before the start of autologous blood donor programme, so that large iron reserves are available prior to the beginning of the Abseamed therapy.</seg>
<seg id="404">6 The recommended dosage is 600 I.U. / kg epetin alfa, which should be given once a week for three weeks (day 21, 14 and 7) before surgery and on the day of surgery (day 0).</seg>
<seg id="405">In this case epoetin alfa should preoperatively present 300 I.U. / kg to 10 consecutive days each, on the day of the procedure as well as 4 days immediately afterwards.</seg>
<seg id="406">Alternatively, the injection at the end of dialysis can be given via a fistula needle, followed by 10 ml isotonic saline solution to flush the hose and ensure adequate injection of the medicine into the circulation.</seg>
<seg id="407">Patients suffering from an erythroblastosis in an erythroblastoenie (pure Red Cell Aplasia, PRCA) should not receive a Abseamed or another erythropoetin (see section 4.4 - erythroblastoenie).</seg>
<seg id="408">Heart attack or stroke within a month prior to treatment, unstable angina pectoris, increased risk of deep venous thromboses (e.g. anamnestic known venous thrombboembolism).</seg>
<seg id="409">In patients who are envisaged for greater elective orthopaedic surgery and which cannot participate in an autologous blood donation program, the application of epoetin alfa is contraindicated in the following pre-, accompanying or underlying disease: severe coronary heart disease, peripheral arterial disease, vascular disease of the carcinoma or cerebrovascular disorder; in patients with recently occurred heart attack or cerebrovascular event.</seg>
<seg id="410">Erythroblastoeny (PRCA) Very rare was reported on the occurrence of an antibody-mediated PRCA after months of treatment with subcutaneous erythropoietin.</seg>
<seg id="411">In patients with sudden loss of action, defined as a reduction in hemoglobin values (1 - 2 g / dl per month) with increased need for transfusions, the reticulocyte value should be determined and the usual causes for non-response (iron, folic acid or vitamin B12 deficiency, aluminum toxidation, infections or inflammations, blood loss and haemolysis) are examined.</seg>
<seg id="412">If the Retikulozyte value, taking into account the anaemia (i.e. the reticulocus "index"), is low (&lt; 20.000 / mm3 or &lt; 0.5%), the thrombocyten- and leukocyte numbers are determined, and if no other cause of an effective loss is found, the anti-erythropoietin antibodies should be induced to diagnose a PRCA.</seg>
<seg id="413">The data on immunogenicity in subcutaneous use of Abseamed in patients with a risk of antibody-induced PRCA (patients with renal anemia) are not sufficient.</seg>
<seg id="414">8 In patients with chronic renal insufficiency, the recommended upper limit of hemoglobin concentration should not be exceeded under section 4.2.</seg>
<seg id="415">In clinical trials, increased mortality risk and risk for serious cardiovascular events were observed when erythropoesis-stimulating active substances (ESA) were given with a haemoglobin concentration of over 12 g / dl (7.5 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="416">Controlled clinical studies have shown no significant benefit if the haemoglobin concentration is increased by the concentration required to control the anemia symptoms and the avoidance of blood transfusions.</seg>
<seg id="417">The haemoglobin rose should be approximately 1 g / dl (0.62 mmol / l) per month and should not exceed 2 g / dl (1.25 mmol / l) per month to minimize the risk of increasing high blood pressure.</seg>
<seg id="418">In patients with chronic renal insufficiency and clinically evident coronary heart disease or congestive heart failure, the recommended upper limit of hemoglobin concentration should not be exceeded in maintenance therapy.</seg>
<seg id="419">According to the present findings, the treatment of anaemia with epoetin alfa in adults with renal insufficiency, which are not yet to be dialysis, does not accelerate the progression of renal insufficiency.</seg>
<seg id="420">For tumour patients with chemotherapy, a 2-3-week delay between epoetin alfa-administration and erythropoietin response should be considered for assessing the therapy efficiency of epoetin alfa (patients who have to be transcoded).</seg>
<seg id="421">If the Hb increase exceeds 2 g / dl (1.25 mmol / l) per month or a Hb-value of 13 g / dl (8.1 mmol / l), the dose must be adjusted according to section 4.2 to minimize the risk of possible thrombotic events (see section 4.2 treatment of patients with chemotherapeutic anaemia - dosage adjustment with the goal of holding the haemoglobin value between 10 g / dl and 12 g / dl).</seg>
<seg id="422">The decision for the use of recombinant erythropoetine should be based on a benefit-risk assessment based on the participation of the patient, which should also take into account the specific clinical context.</seg>
<seg id="423">In patients who are envisaged for greater elective orthopaedic surgery, the cause of anaemia should be examined and treated if possible prior to epoetin alfa therapy.</seg>
<seg id="424">Patients who undergo major elective orthopaedic surgery should have an appropriate thrombosis prophylaxis, as they have an increased risk of thrombotic and vascular diseases, especially with an underlying cardiovascular disease.</seg>
<seg id="425">In addition, it cannot be ruled out that for treatment with epoetin alfa for patients with a starting threshold of &gt; 13 g / dl there is an increased risk of post-operative thrombotic / vascular events.</seg>
<seg id="426">In several controlled trials, epoetin was not proven to improve overall survival in tumour patients with symptomatic anaemia or reduce the risk of tumour progression.</seg>
<seg id="427">4 months in patients with metastatic breast cancer who received chemotherapy, when hemoglobin target concentration was targeted at 12 - 14 g / dl (7.5 - 8,7 mmol / l)</seg>
<seg id="428">If epoetin alfa is used together with Ciclosporin, the blood level of Ciclosporin should be controlled and the Ciclosporin dose should be adjusted to the rise in hematocrit.</seg>
<seg id="429">In vitro studies on tumor tissues, there is no evidence of an interaction between epoetin alfa and G-CSF or GM-CSF regarding hematological differentiation or proliferation.</seg>
<seg id="430">Through thrombotic, vascular events such as myocardial ischemia, myocardial infarction, cerebrovascular attacks, deep venous thrombosis, arterial thrombosis, pulmonary thromboses, aneurysm, retinothromboses, and 11 blood clots in artificial kidneys were reported in patients under erythropoetin therapy, as well as patients under epoetin alfa.</seg>
<seg id="431">The most common adverse effect during treatment with epoetin alfa is a dose-dependent increase in blood pressure or the deterioration of an existing hypertension.</seg>
<seg id="432">Increased incidence of thrombovascular events (see Section 4.4 and Section 4.8 - General) was observed in patients with erythropoetins.</seg>

<seg id="574">The second study included 2 127 men and women with osteoporosis over 50 years who recently suffered a hip fracture; the number of fractures was examined over a period of up to five years.</seg>
<seg id="575">At Morbus Paget, Aclasta was tested in two studies on a total of 357 patients and compared for six months with Risedronat (another bisphosphonate).</seg>
<seg id="576">The main indicator of the efficacy was whether the content of the alkaline phosphatase in the serum (an enzyme that breaks down bone substance) in the blood renormalized or decreased by at least 75% compared to the initial value.</seg>
<seg id="577">In the study involving elderly women, the risk of vertebrae fractures in patients under Aclasta (excluding other osteoporosis) was reduced by 70% over a period of three years compared to the placebo patients.</seg>
<seg id="578">Compared to all patients under Aclasta (with or without other osteoporosis) with those under placebo, the risk of hip fractures was reduced by 41%.</seg>
<seg id="579">In the study involving men and women with hip fractures, 9% of patients under Aclasta had a fracture (92 from 1 065) versus 13% of patients under placebo (139 of 1 062).</seg>
<seg id="580">Most Aclasta adverse events occur within the first three days after infusion and are less frequent in repeated infections.</seg>
<seg id="581">Aclasta may not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to Zoltronics or other bisphosphonates or any of the other ingredients.</seg>
<seg id="582">As with all bisphosphonates, patients with Aclasta are exposed to the risk of kidney problems, reactions to the infusion point and osteonecsis (death of bone tissue) in the jaw.</seg>
<seg id="583">The manufacturer of Aclasta provides information for doctors who prescribe Aclasta to treat osteoporosis, containing tips on how to use the medicine, as well as similar material for patients in which the side effects of the medicine are explained and pointed out when they should contact the doctor.</seg>
<seg id="584">In April 2005, the European Commission granted the company Novartis Europharm Limited an approval for the transport of Aclasta throughout the European Union.</seg>

<seg id="586">Treatment of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women and in men with increased risk of fractures, including in patients with a recent low-traumatic hip fractures.</seg>
<seg id="587">The Patient Information Package should be provided and the following core messages include: • Concontraindication in pregnancy and in nursing women • Required of adequate intake of calcium and vitamin D, adequate physical activity, non-smoking and a healthy diet • Important signs and symptoms for serious side effects • When medical or nursing assistance is necessary</seg>
<seg id="588">Treatment of osteoporosis • in postmenopausal women • in men with increased risk of fractures, including in patients with a recent low-traumatic hip fractures.</seg>
<seg id="589">Intravenous infusion of 5 mg Aclasta is recommended once a year to treat postmenopausal osteoporosis and osteoporosis in men.</seg>
<seg id="590">In patients with low-traumatic hip fractures the administration of the infusion of Aclasta is recommended two or more weeks after surgical treatment of hip fractures (see Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="591">For the treatment of Paget's disease, Aclasta should be prescribed only by doctors who have experience in the treatment of the Paget Morbus.</seg>
<seg id="592">After treatment of the Paget's disease with Aclasta, a long remission period was observed in patients who responded to the therapy (see Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="593">In addition, it is highly advisable to ensure an adequate intake of calcium in patients with morbus paget, corresponding twice daily at least 500 mg of basic calcium, for at least 10 days after the administration of Aclasta (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="594">In patients with a recent low-traumatic hip fracture, an initial dose of 50,000 to 125.000 I.U. oral or intramuscular vitamin D is recommended before the first Aclasta infusion.</seg>
<seg id="595">The frequency of symptoms occurring within the first three days after the administration of Aclasta can be reduced by offering paracetamol or ibuprofen shortly after use of Aclasta.</seg>
<seg id="596">Patients with kidney function disorder (see section 4.4) In patients with a creatinin Clearance &lt; 35 ml / min Aclasta is not recommended as limited clinical experience for this group of patients is present.</seg>
<seg id="597">Older patients (≥ 65 years) A dose adjustment is not necessary because bioavailability, distribution and elimination in older patients are similar to younger ones.</seg>
<seg id="598">Children and adolescents of Aclasta are not recommended for use in children and adolescents under 18 years of age because data on safety and efficacy are missing.</seg>
<seg id="599">Aclasta is not recommended in patients with severe renal insufficiency (Kreatinin Clearance &lt; 35 ml / min) as a limited clinical experience exists for this patient population.</seg>
<seg id="600">Preexisting hypokalemia is to be treated with Aclasta before starting therapy with sufficient intake of calcium and vitamin D (see Section 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="601">Due to the quick insertion of the effect of Zoltronics on bone conversion, a temporary, occasionally symptomatic hypokalemia can develop, the maximum occurs usually within the first 10 days after the infusion of Aclasta (see section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="602">In addition, it is highly advisable to ensure an adequate intake of calcium in patients with morbus paget, corresponding twice daily at least 500 mg of basic calcium, for at least 10 days after the administration of Aclasta (see section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="603">Cancer, chemotherapy, treatment with corticosteroids, poor oral hygiene should be considered before using bisphosphonates with appropriate preventive tooth treatment.</seg>
<seg id="604">For patients who need dental surgery, no data is available whether the interruption of treatment with bisphosphonates reduces the risk of osteonecrosis in the jaw area.</seg>
<seg id="605">The clinical evaluation by the treating physician should be the basis for the treatment plan of each patient and based on an individual benefit risk assessment.</seg>
<seg id="606">The frequency of symptoms occurring within the first three days after administration of Aclasta can be reduced by offering paracetamol or ibuprofen shortly after use of Aclasta (see section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="607">Cases of atrial fibrillation reported as a serious adverse event were increased (1.3%) (51 of 3,862) compared to patients receiving placebo (0,6%) (22 by 3,852).</seg>
<seg id="608">In osteoporosis studies (PFT, HORIZON - Recurrent Fracture Trial [RFT]), the overall frequency of atrial fibrillation between Aclasta (2.6%) and placebo (2.1%) was comparable.</seg>
<seg id="609">Very common (≥ 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 10), occasional (≥ 1 / 1,000, &lt; 1 / 100), rare (≥ 1 / 10,000, &lt; 1 / 1,000) adverse drug interactions are listed in Table 1.</seg>
<seg id="610">Kidney function disorder Zoltronics has been associated with renal function disorders, which have been associated as a decrease in renal function (i.e. an increase in serum creatinine) and in rare cases as acute renal failure.</seg>
<seg id="611">The change in the Kreatinin Clearance (measured annually before administration) and the occurrence of kidney failure and a restricted kidney function were in a clinical trial for osteoporosis over three years comparable to the Aclasta- and placebo group.</seg>
<seg id="612">A temporary increase in serum creatinine within 10 days of the administration was observed in 1.8% of the patients treated with Aclasta versus 0.8% of the patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="613">Based on the evaluation of the laboratory findings, the temporary asymptomatic calcium levels, which were below the normal fluctuation range (less than 2.10 mmol / l), were up to 21% of patients treated with Aclasta in the Morbus Paget studies.</seg>
<seg id="614">All patients received sufficient amounts of vitamin D and calcium in the postmenopausal osteoporosis study, in the study to prevent recurrent clinical fractures after hip fractures and in the morbus paget studies (see section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="615">In the study to avoid clinical fractures after a recently fractured hip fracture, the vitamin D levels were not routinely measured, but the majority of patients received an initial dose of vitamin D before administration of Aclasta (see section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="616">Local reactions after the administration of Zoltronics in a large clinical study was reported on local reactions to the fusion site, such as redness, swelling and / or pain, (0.7%).</seg>
<seg id="617">Osteonekrosis in the slate area was deliberated, especially in cancer patients, via osteonekrosis (primarily in the jaw area) reported with bisphosphonates, including Zoltronics, were treated.</seg>
<seg id="618">Many of these patients had signs of local infections including osteomyelitis, and most of the reports relate to cancer patients after tooth extraction or other dental attacks.</seg>
<seg id="619">7 Study with 7,736 patients showed Osteonecrosis in the maxillary region in a patient treated with Aclasta and placebo treated patients.</seg>
<seg id="620">In case of overdosing, which leads to clinically relevant hypokalemia, a compensation of oral calcium and / or intravenous infusion of calcium gluconate can be achieved.</seg>
<seg id="621">Clinical effectiveness in the treatment of postmenopausal osteoporosis (PFT) The efficacy and safety of Aclasta 5 mg once a year for three consecutive years was shown with either a bone density (BMD) T-Score for the Schenkelhthan ≤ -2.5 with or without any signs of an existing vertebral fracture.</seg>
<seg id="622">Effects on morphometric vertebral fractures Aclasta lowered significantly over a period of three years and already after one year the frequency of one or more new vertebral fractures (see Table 2).</seg>
<seg id="623">Aclasta-treated patients from 75 years and older had a 60% reduced risk of vertebral fractures compared to placebo patients (p &lt; 0.0001).</seg>
<seg id="624">Effects on hip fractures Aclasta showed a lasting effect over three years, which resulted in a reduced risk of hip fractures in a 41% (95% CI, 17% to 58%).</seg>
<seg id="625">Effect on bone density (BMD) Aclasta increased bone density on lumbar vertebraic acid, hip and distal radius compared to placebo treatment significantly at all time points (6, 12, 24 and 36 months).</seg>
<seg id="626">9 Increase the bone density of the lumbar spine by 6.7%, the total hip by 6.0%, the lower thigh by 5.1% and the distal radius by 3.2%.</seg>
<seg id="627">Bone histology in 152 postmenopausal osteoporotic patients treated with Aclasta (N = 82) or placebo (N = 70) were taken from the pelvis after the third annual dose of bone biopsies.</seg>
<seg id="628">A microcomputer tomography (µCT) analysis showed an increase in the trabecular bone volume compared with placebo and the preservation of the trabecular bone architecture compared to placebo.</seg>
<seg id="629">Bone-specific alkaline phosphatase (BSAP), the N-terminale propeptide of the type I- collagen (P1NP) in serum and the beta-C-telopeptide (b-CTx) in serum were determined in sub-groups of 517 to 1,246 patients in periodic intervals during the study period.</seg>
<seg id="630">The treatment with an annual 5 mg dose of Aclasta reduced BSAP after 12 months significantly by 30% compared to the initial value and was kept at 28% below the initial value up to 36 months.</seg>
<seg id="631">P1NP was significantly reduced by 61% below the initial value after 12 months and was kept at 52% below the initial value up to 36 months.</seg>
<seg id="632">B-CTx was significantly reduced by 61% below the initial value after 12 months and was kept at 55% below the initial value up to 36 months.</seg>
<seg id="633">The vitamin D levels were not routinely measured, but the majority of patients received an initial dose of vitamin D (50,000 to 125.000 I.U. oral or intramuscular) 2 weeks prior to infusion.</seg>
<seg id="634">Total mortality was 10% (101 patients) in the group treated with Aclasta compared with 13% (141 patients) in the placebo group.</seg>
<seg id="635">Effect on bone mineral density (BMD) In the HORIZON-RFT study, the Aclasta treatment in comparison to placebo treatment increased the BMD on the overall shaft and thigh at all time points.</seg>
<seg id="636">The Aclasta treatment led over 24 months compared to placebo treatment to increase the BMD by 5.4% on the overall balance and by 4.3% at the neck.</seg>
<seg id="637">Clinical efficacy in men In the HORIZON-RFT study, 508 were randomised and 185 patients evaluated the BMD after 24 months.</seg>
<seg id="638">The study was not designed to show a reduction in men's clinical ctures; the incidence of clinical fractures was 7.5% in Aclasta-treated males versus 8.7% in placebo.</seg>
<seg id="639">In another study in men (study CZOL446M2308), the annual administration of Aclasta compared to the once weekly administration of alendronat was not inferior to the percentage change of the lumbar vertebrae BMD after 24 months compared to the initial value.</seg>
<seg id="640">Clinical efficacy of the treatment at Morbus Paget of the bone Aclasta was examined in patients aged over 30 years with radiologically confirmed, especially light to moderately heavy morbus Paget of the bone (medium serum levels of alkaline phosphatase according to the 2.6fold up to 3,0fold age-specific upper normal value when recording in the study).</seg>
<seg id="641">11 The efficacy of an infusion of 5 mg of Zoltronic acid in comparison to taking 30 mg of Risedronat once daily for 2 months has been demonstrated in two six months comparative studies.</seg>
<seg id="642">The combined results showed a similar decrease in pain intensity and pain influencing compared to the initial value for Aclasta and Risedronat.</seg>
<seg id="643">Patients who were classified as Responder at the end of the six month study (responded to the therapy) could be included in an observational phase.</seg>
<seg id="644">Of the 143 patients treated with Aclasta and 107 patients treated with Risedronat, the therapeutic response from 141 of patients treated with Risedronat could be maintained in an average duration of the follow-up period of 18 months after the application.</seg>
<seg id="645">One-time and multiple 5 and 15 minutes of continuous infusion of 2, 4, 8 and 16 mg. of Zoltronics in 64 patients showed the following pharmacokinetic data, which proved to be dose-independent.</seg>
<seg id="646">Then the plasma levels rapidly decrease to &lt; 10% of the maximum value after 4 h and &lt; 1% after 24 h, followed by a long-lasting phase of very low concentration, no more than 0.1% of the maximum value.</seg>
<seg id="647">Rapid biphasic disappearance from the large cycle with half-life of ½ α 0.24 and t ½ β 1,87 hours followed by a long period of elimination with a terminal elimination of ½ g 146 hours.</seg>
<seg id="648">The early distribution phases (α and β, with the above t ½ -values) presumably represent the rapid absorption in the bones and excretion over the kidneys.</seg>
<seg id="649">In the first 24 hours, 39 ± 16% of the administered dose can be found in the urine while the rest is mainly bonded to bone tissue.</seg>
<seg id="650">The total body Clearance is independent of the dose of 5,04 ± 2.5 l / h and remains unaffected by gender, age, race or body weight.</seg>
<seg id="651">An extension of the infusion time of 5 to 15 minutes led to the decrease of the customs presence concentration at 30% at the end of the infusion, but had no effect on the area below the curve (plasma concentration against time).</seg>
<seg id="652">A diminished clearance of metabolized substances metabolized by cytochrom-P450 enzyme systems is unlikely because Zoltalic acid is not metabolized by humans and because they are a weak or even no direct and / or irreversible, material-dependent inhibitor of the P450-</seg>
<seg id="653">Special patient groups (see section 4.2) The renal Clearance of Zoltronics correlated with the Kreatinin Clearance, namely 75 ± 33% of the Kreatinin Clearance, and was 84 ± 29 ml / min for 64 patients studied (range 22 to 143 ml / min).</seg>
<seg id="654">This results in a light (Clcr = 50-80 ml / min) and moderate kidney dysfunction to down to a creatinin Clearance up to 35 ml / min no dosage adjustment of the Zoltronic acid required.</seg>
<seg id="655">Since for severe kidney dysfunction (Kreatinin- Clearance &lt; 30 ml / min) only limited data are available, no statements are possible for this population.</seg>
<seg id="656">Acute toxicity The highest intravenous intravenous single dose in mice was 10 mg / kg of body weight and at rats 0.6 mg / kg body weight.</seg>
<seg id="657">In studies in dogs, single doses of 1.0 mg / kg (based on AUC were 6 times the recommended human-therapeutic exposure), administered over a period of 15 minutes, good and without a renal influence.</seg>
<seg id="658">Chronic and chronic toxicity In studies with intravenous application, the renal tolerability of Zoltronics was determined in rats by taking doses of 0.6 mg / kg as a 15-minute infusion in 3-day intervals, administered in intervals of 2- 3 weeks (a cumulative dose equivalent to the multiple of human-therapeutic exposure, related to the AUC, equivalent), well tolerated.</seg>
<seg id="659">In long-term studies with repeated use in cumulated expositions which exceeded the maximum of the intended human exposure, toxicological effects on other organs including the gastrointestinal tract and the liver and the intravenous injection point occurred.</seg>
<seg id="660">The most common finding in trials involving repeated use was an increased primary spongiosa in the metaphysis of long bones in animals in the growth phase with almost all dosages, a finding that reflects the pharmacological, anti-resortive effect of the substance.</seg>
<seg id="661">Rats observed a teratogenicity in dosages from 0.2 mg / kg as external and inner (visceral) abnormalities and such of skeleton.</seg>
<seg id="662">No teratogenic effects or embryo-fetal effects were observed in rabbits, although the maternal toxicity was pronounced at 0.1 mg / kg as a result of the low serum calcium level.</seg>

<seg id="749">Summary of the EPAR for the public The present document is a summary of the European Public Assessment Report (EPAR), which explains how the Committee for Medicinal Products (CHMP) has assessed the studies carried out to make recommendations regarding the use of the drug.</seg>
<seg id="750">Actos is used to treat type 2 diabetes (also known as non-insulin-dependent diabetes). • It can be applied alone (monotherapy) in patients (particularly overweight patients) in which metformin (a diabetes medication) is not indicated.</seg>
<seg id="751">In addition to metformin in patients (particularly overweight patients), metformin alone can not be satisfactory in the highest tolerable dose alone.</seg>
<seg id="752">In combination with sulfonylurea or insulin, the previous dose of the sulfonylurea or insulin can be maintained at the beginning of the Actos treatment, except for patients with hypoglycemia (low blood sugar); here, the dose of the sulfonic acid or insulin should be reduced.</seg>
<seg id="753">This means that the body's own insulin can be better utilized and blood sugar levels are reduced and type 2 diabetes can be better adjusted.</seg>
<seg id="754">In more than 1 400 patients the efficacy of Actos was studied in triple therapy; patients received a combination of metformin with sulfonylresins, in addition they received either Actos or placebo for up to 3.5 years.</seg>
<seg id="755">In the studies the concentration of a substance in the blood (glycosylated hemoglobin, HbA1c) was measured, indicating how well the blood sugar is adjusted.</seg>
<seg id="756">Actos resulted in a reduction in the HbA1c value, suggesting that the blood sugar levels were reduced in the application of 15 mg, 30 mg and 45 mg doses.</seg>
<seg id="757">At the end of the tripletherapy study, the effect of an additional application of Actos for the existing treatment with metformin and sulphonylene was 0.94%, while the additional administration of placebo resulted in a reduction of 0.35%.</seg>
<seg id="758">In a small study in which the combination of Actos and insulin was examined in 289 patients, the patients, in addition to insulin, decreased the HbA1c values of 0.69% after 6 months, compared with 0.14% in the patients who took placebo.</seg>
<seg id="759">The most common side effects associated with Actos were vision disturbances, upper respiratory infections (colds), weight gain, and anaesthesia (reduced sensitivity to irritation).</seg>
<seg id="760">Actos can neither be used in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to pioglitazone or one of the other components, or in patients with liver problems, heart failure or diabetic ketoacidosis (high ketone level - acid levels - in the blood).</seg>
<seg id="761">It was decided that Actos is supposed to serve as an alternative to the standard treatment with metformin in patients with which metformin is not indicated.</seg>
<seg id="762">In October 2000, the European Commission granted the takeover of Actos in the entire European Union to Takeda Europe R & D Centre Limited.</seg>
<seg id="763">The tablets are white to whitish, round, arched and carry on one side the marker "15" and on the other side the inscription "Actos."</seg>
<seg id="764">Pioglitazone is also indicated for the combination of insulin in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, whose blood sugar is inadequate with insulin and in which metformin is inappropriate due to contraindications or intolerance (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="765">There are no data available to use pioglitazone in patients under 18 years of age, therefore the application in this age group is not recommended.</seg>
<seg id="766">In patients who are at risk of at least one risk factor (e.g. previous heart attack or symptomatic coronary heart disease) to develop a decompensated heart failure, the doctor should start the treatment with the lowest available dose and gradually increase the dose.</seg>
<seg id="767">Patients should be observed on signs and symptoms of heart failure, weight gain or edema, especially those with reduced cardiac reserve.</seg>
<seg id="768">Patients should be observed on signs and symptoms of heart failure, weight gain and edema when pioglitazone is applied in combination with insulin.</seg>
<seg id="769">A cardiovascular outcome study with Pioglitazone in patients under 75 years with type 2 diabetes mellitus and preexisting advanced macrovascular disease was performed.</seg>
<seg id="770">This study showed an increase in the reports on heart failure, which did not lead to an increase in mortality in the study.</seg>
<seg id="771">In patients with increased output of liver enzymes (ALT &gt; 2.5 x upper limit of the normal range) or with other signs of liver disease, pioglitazone may not be used.</seg>
<seg id="772">If the ALT levels are increased by up to 3 times the upper limit of the normal range, the liver enzymes will be checked again as soon as possible.</seg>
<seg id="773">If a patient develops symptoms that point to hepatic dysfunction, such as unexplained nausea, vomiting, upset stomach problems, fatigue, loss of appetite and / or dark urine, the liver enzymes are to be checked.</seg>
<seg id="774">The decision whether the treatment of the patient is continued with Pioglitazone should be guided by clinical evaluation until the clinical trial has been submitted.</seg>
<seg id="775">In clinical trials with Pioglitazone, a dose-dependent weight gain has been demonstrated which can be caused by fatty deposits and in some cases linked to fluid retention.</seg>
<seg id="776">A minor reduction in the mean hemoglobin values (relative reduction by 4%) and hematokrits (relative reduction by 4.1%) occurred as a result of hemodilution.</seg>
<seg id="777">Similar changes were observed in comparable controlled trials with pioglitazone in patients under metformin (relative reduction in hemoglobin by 3-4% and hematocripits by 1-2% and hematocripits by 1-3.2%).</seg>
<seg id="778">As a result of increased insulin sensitivity, there is a risk of dose-dependent hypoglycemia in patients who receive Pioglitazone as oral two-fold or triple-combination therapy with a sulfonylurea or as a dual combination therapy with insulin.</seg>
<seg id="779">After the market launch, a decrease in visual acuity was reported under the treatment with thiazolidIndionen, including Pioglitazone, on the occurrence or deterioration of a diabetic macular edema.</seg>
<seg id="780">It is unclear whether there is a direct connection between the taking of Pioglitazone and the occurrence of macular edema, but prescribed physicians should be aware of the possibility of a macular edema when patients report disorders of visual acuity; a suitable ophthalmological examination should be considered.</seg>
<seg id="781">In a summarizing analysis of adverse events regarding bone fractures from randomised, controlled, double-blind clinical trials over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,100 patients treated with Pioglitazone</seg>
<seg id="782">The calculated fracture incidence was 1.9 fractures per 100 patient year in women treated with Pioglitazone and 1.1 fractures per 100 patient years in women treated with a comparison medication.</seg>
<seg id="783">In the ProActive study, a study of 3,5 years for the investigation of cardiovascular events, fractures occurred at 44 / 870 (5.1%; 1.0 fractures per 100 patient years) of patients treated with Pioglitazone (2.5%; 0.5 fractures per 100 patient years) in patients treated with a comparison medication.</seg>
<seg id="784">Patients should be aware of the possibility of pregnancy and if a patient wishes to have a pregnancy or this occurs, the treatment must be dismissed (see Section 4.6).</seg>
<seg id="785">Studies on the study of interactions have shown that Pioglitazone does not have any relevant effects on the pharmacokinetics or pharmacodynamics of digoxin, warfarin, phenprocoumon and metformin.</seg>
<seg id="786">Drug interactions that are metabolized by these enzymes, e.g. oral contraceptives, cyclosporine, calcium channel blocker and HMGCoA reductase inhibitors are not to be expected.</seg>
<seg id="787">The simultaneous application of Pioglitazone with gemfibrozil (a cytochrome P450 2C8- inhibitor) resulted in an increase of the AUC of Pioglitazone by 3 times.</seg>
<seg id="788">The simultaneous application of Pioglitazon with Rifampicin (a Cytochrome P450 2C8-inductor) resulted in a decrease of the AUC of Pioglitazon by 54%.</seg>
<seg id="789">This is due to the fact that under treatment with Pioglitazone the hyperinsulinemia and increased insulin resistance of the parent is reduced, thereby reducing the availability of the metabolic substrates for the fetal growth.</seg>
<seg id="790">Very common &gt; 1 / 10; common &gt; 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 10; occasionally &gt; 1 / 1000, &lt; 1 / 100; rare &gt; 1 / 10000, &lt; 1 / 1000; very rare &lt; 1 / 10000, single cases: unknown (not estimable from this data).</seg>
<seg id="791">These lead to a temporary change in the turbine and the refractive index of the lens, as observed in other hypoglycaemic agents.</seg>
<seg id="792">In clinical trials with Pioglitazon, ALT ascents of the triples of the upper limit of the normal range were similar to placebo, but less often than in comparison groups of metformin or sulfonylusional.</seg>
<seg id="793">In an Outcome study in patients with preexisting advanced macrovascular disease, the incidence of severe cardiac insufficiency under Pioglitazone was 1.6% higher than placebo when Pioglitazon resides.</seg>
<seg id="794">Since the market launch has rarely been reported on cardiac insufficiency under Pioglitazone, however, if Pioglitazone was used in combination with insulin or in patients with congestive heart failure in the anamnesis.</seg>
<seg id="795">A summary analysis of adverse events regarding bone fractures from randomised, controlled, double-blind clinical trials over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,100 patients in the groups treated with Pioglitazone and over 7,400 patients in the groups treated with comparison medication.</seg>
<seg id="796">In the ProActive study running over a period of 3.5 years, fractures yielded 44 / 870 (5.1%) of patients treated with Pioglitazone, compared with 23 / 905 (2.5%) in patients treated with a comparison medication.</seg>
<seg id="797">When taking the reported maximum dose of 120 mg / day over four days, then 180 mg / day over seven days did not show any symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="798">Pioglitazone seems to have activated activated carbon receptors (peroxisome proliferation activated Receptor-γ (PPAR-γ)), leading to increased insulin sensitivity of liver, fat and skeletal muscle cells in the animal model.</seg>
<seg id="799">It could be shown that Pioglitazone reduces glucose production in the liver and increases peripheral glucose consumption in the event of insulin resistance.</seg>
<seg id="800">A clinical study with Pioglitazon versus Gliclazid as a monotherapy was continued over two years in order to investigate the time until the therapeutic effect was confirmed (defined as HbA1c ≥ 8.0% after the first 6 months of treatment).</seg>
<seg id="801">At the time of two years after the beginning of the therapy, a blood glucose control (defined as HbA1c &lt; 8.0%) was maintained by Pioglitazon in 69% of the patients treated (compared to 50% of the patients under gliclazid).</seg>
<seg id="802">In a placebo-controlled study of 12 months, patients whose blood sugar had been inadequate with insulin in spite of three months of improvement phase were randomized to Pioglitazone or placebo.</seg>
<seg id="803">In patients with Pioglitazone, the mean HbA1c decreased by 0.45% compared to the patients who continued to receive insulin; a reduction in insulin dosage in the group treated with Pioglitazone was observed.</seg>
<seg id="804">In clinical trials over a year, a statistically significant decrease in the albumin / creatinin quotients showed a statistically significant decrease compared to the baseline values.</seg>
<seg id="805">The effect of Pioglitazone (monotherapy with 45 mg versus placebo) was tested in a small, 18 week study of type 2 diabetic patients.</seg>
<seg id="806">In most clinical trials compared to placebo, a reduction in total plasma triglycerides and free fatty acids and an increase in HDL cholesterol levels and insignificant, but clinically not significantly increased LDL cholesterol levels have been observed.</seg>
<seg id="807">In clinical trials over a period of up to two years, Pioglitazone reduced total plasmatriol glycerides and free fatty acids and increased the HDL Cholesterinspiegel in comparison with placebo, metformin or gliclasia.</seg>
<seg id="808">In comparison to placebo, no statistically significant increase in LDL cholesterol was observed under Pioglitazone, while reduced values were observed under metformin and gliclazide.</seg>
<seg id="809">In a study of over 20 weeks, Pioglitazon reduced not only the grocet triglycerides but also improved triglyceride level, which has an effect on triglyceride absorption and hepatic triglyceride synthesis.</seg>
<seg id="810">In the ProActive study, a cardiovascular outcome study, 5238 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and pre-existing advanced macrovascular disease were randomised to receive either pioglitazone or placebo over a period of up to 3.5 years.</seg>
<seg id="811">According to oral application, Pioglitazone is absorbed quickly, whereby the peak concentrations of unaltered Pioglitazon in plasma are usually achieved 2 hours after application.</seg>
<seg id="812">This is based on the contribution of M-IV to effectiveness in roughly three-times the efficacy of Pioglitazone, while the relative efficacy of M-II is minimal.</seg>
<seg id="813">In interaction studies, it was possible to demonstrate that Pioglitazon has no relevant effect on pharmacokinetics or pharmacokinetics of digoxin, warfarin, phenprocoumon and metformin.</seg>
<seg id="814">The simultaneous application of Pioglitazone with gemfibrozil (a cytochrome P450 2C8- Inhibitor) or with Rifampicin (a cytochrome P450 2C8-inductor) increases or lowers the plasma concentration of Pioglitazone (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="815">After the oral application of radioactively marked pioglitazone in humans, the marker was found mainly in the rot (55%) and to a lesser extent in the urine (45%).</seg>
<seg id="816">The average plasma elimination of unaltered Pioglitazone is 5-6 hours for humans, and the total active metabolites are 16 - 23 hours.</seg>
<seg id="817">The plasma concentrations of pioglitazone and its metabolites are lower in patients with reduced kidney function than in healthy subjects, but the rates of oral fluorescence are similar.</seg>
<seg id="818">Toxicological studies coincided with mice, rats, dogs and monkeys after repeated administration of plasma volume enlargement with hemodilution, anemia and reversible eccentric heart hypertrophy.</seg>
<seg id="819">This is due to the fact that under treatment with Pioglitazone the hyperinsulinemia and increased insulin resistance of the parent is reduced, thereby reducing the availability of the metabolic substrates for the fetal growth.</seg>
<seg id="820">In long-term studies (up to 2 years), increased incidence of hyperplasia (in male and female rats) and tumors (in male rats) of the bladder epithelium were induced.</seg>
<seg id="821">In a animal model of the family adenomatous polyposis (FAP) the treatment with two other thiazolidindians led to an increased frequency of colon tumors.</seg>
<seg id="822">The tablets are white to whitish, round, flat and carry on one side the marker "30" and on the other side the inscription "Actos."</seg>
<seg id="823">The calculated fracture incidence was 1.9 fractures per 100 patient year in women treated with Pioglitazone and 1.1 fractures per 100 patient years in women treated with a comparison medication.</seg>
<seg id="824">In the ProActive study, a study of 3,5 years for the investigation of cardiovascular events, fractures occurred at 44 / 870 (5.1%; 1.0 fractures per 100 patient years) of patients treated with Pioglitazone (2.5%; 0.5 fractures per 100 patient years) in patients treated with a comparison medication.</seg>
<seg id="825">In another study for two years the effects of a combination therapy of metformin with either pioglitazone or gliclazide were investigated.</seg>
<seg id="826">In clinical trials over one year, a statistically significant decrease in the albumin / creatinin quotients showed a statistically significant decrease compared to the baseline values.</seg>
<seg id="827">In a study of more than 20 weeks, Pioglitazon reduced not only the groceride triglycerides but also improved the postprandial elevated triglyceride level, which has an effect on the tryglyceride absorption as well as the hepatic Tryglicerid synthesis.</seg>
<seg id="828">Although the study missed the target with regard to its primary endpoint, which presented a combination of the total mortality, non-fatal myocardial infarction, stroke, acute coronary syndrome, leg amputation above the ankle, coronary vascularization and revisions of the leg arteries, the results suggest that with the intake of Pioglitazon there are no cardiovascular long-term risks.</seg>
<seg id="829">The tablets are white to whitish, round, flat and carry on one side the marker "45" and on the other side the inscription "Actos."</seg>
<seg id="830">In a summarizing analysis of adverse events regarding bone fractures from randomised, controlled, double-blind clinical trials over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,100 patients treated with pioglitazone and more than 7,400 patients receiving a comparison medication, there was an increased incidence of bone fractures in women.</seg>
<seg id="831">In the ProActive study, a study of 3,5 years for the investigation of cardiovascular events, fractures occurred at 44 / 870 (5.1%; 1.0 fractures per 100 patient years) of patients treated with Pioglitazone (2.5%; 0.5 fractures per 100 patient years) in patients treated with a comparison medication.</seg>
<seg id="832">In a study of more than 20 weeks, Pioglitazon reduced not only the groceride triglycerides but also improved the postprandial high triglyceride level, which has an effect on triglyceride absorption as well as the hepatic triglyceride synthesis.</seg>

<seg id="864">Actraphane was studied in a total of 294 patients with type 1 diabetes, in which the pancreas cannot produce insulin, and type 2 diabetes, in which the body is unable to effectively use insulin.</seg>
<seg id="865">In the study, the concentration of a substance (glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) was measured after 12 weeks, indicating how well the blood sugar is adjusted.</seg>
<seg id="866">Actraphane introduced a decrease in the HbA1c mirror, suggesting that blood sugar levels were lowered similar to that of another human insulin.</seg>
<seg id="867">Actraphane should not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to human insulin (rDNA) or any of the other components.</seg>
<seg id="868">In addition, the doses of Actraphane must be adjusted if it is administered together with a number of other medicines which can affect blood sugar (the complete list is to be found in the package insert).</seg>
<seg id="869">The Committee for Medicinal Products (CHMP) concluded that the benefits of Actraphane outweigh the risks of diabetes.</seg>
<seg id="870">In October 2002, the European Commission granted the company Novo Nordisk A / S approval for the placing of Actraphane in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="871">Premixed insulin-products are usually applied once or twice a day when a rapid initial effect is desired along with a longer lasting effect.</seg>

<seg id="1220">There were no clinically significant differences with regard to the percental decline in serum resin concentrations in subjects, regardless of their renal function (58% in the group with normal renal function and 55% in the group with severe kidney function disorders).</seg>
<seg id="1221">Primary endpoint in the subgroup of patients with serum acid concentrations ≥ 10 mg / dl etwa 40% of patients (APEX and FACT study) had a serum acidity concentration ≥ 10 mg / dl at the beginning of the study (baseline).</seg>
<seg id="1222">The data from the Phase 3 open extension study collected in two years showed that the permanent decrease in serum acid levels was reduced to &lt; 6 mg / dl (&lt; 357 µmol / l), so that less than 3% of patients in the months 16-24 needed treatment for a gout (i.e. more than 97% of patients needed no treatment against a gout).</seg>
<seg id="1223">This was associated with a reduction in peak height, resulting in 54% of patients resulting in a complete disappearance of the gine nodes by month 24.</seg>

<seg id="1278">As alendronat and vitamin D3 are already used separately in medicines approved in the European Union, the Company submitted data from previous studies and published literature.</seg>
<seg id="1279">The company also conducted a study of 35 men and 682 postmenopausal women with osteoporosis in order to demonstrate the efficacy of ADROVANCE in relation to increasing vitamin D levels.</seg>
<seg id="1280">After a 15-week treatment, the proportion of patients with low levels of vitamin D in the patients treated with ADROVANCE was lower (11%) than those who received only Alendronat (32%).</seg>
<seg id="1281">The company also submitted data suggesting that the Alendronat dose contained in ADROVANCE corresponds exactly to the dose needed to prevent bone loss.</seg>
<seg id="1282">The most common side effects (observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients) are headaches, musculoskeletal pain (digestive disorders), constipation, diarrhoea (diarrhea), flatulence (ulcera), ulcers, dysphagia (swallowing), nasal abdomen (bloated abdomen) as well as acidic sensation.</seg>

<seg id="1289">• ADROVANCE should only be swallowed by a full glass of water (at least 200 ml) after rising the day. • Patients should not chewing the tablet or leaving the tablet in the mouth as there is a risk for oropharyngeal ulcera.</seg>
<seg id="1290">B. peptic ulcers, active gastrointestinal bleedings or surgical procedures in the upper Gastrointestinal tract, except Pyloroplastic, are given only with special caution (see Section 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="1291">Esophageal reactions, such as esophagitis, esophageal ulcera and esophageal erosions, rarely followed by esophageal fractures, were reported in patients taking Alendronat (partially these were severe and required hospitalisation).</seg>
<seg id="1292">The doctor should therefore pay attention to all signs and symptoms that point to possible esophageal reactions and patients should be advised to take out the medicine in case of symptoms of esophageal irritation such as dysphagia, pain during swallowing or retrosternal pain or new or worsening heartburn (see paragraph 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="1293">3 The risk of serious esophageal side effects may be increased in patients who are not taking the medicine correctly and / or taking it after onset of symptoms that point to an esophageal irritation.</seg>
<seg id="1294">It is very important that all dosage instructions are passed on to the patient and understood by the patient (see section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="1295">Whereas in large-scale clinical trials with Alendronat there was no increased risk, rare (after market introduction) stomach and duodenal ulcerations, among them some severe and with complications, were reported (see section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="1296">Osteondrosis of the jaw, usually associated with tooth extraction and / or a local infection (including osteomyelitis), was reported in cancer patients whose therapeutic regimens mainly intravenously administered bisphosphonates.</seg>
<seg id="1297">There are no data available indicating whether to remove a bisphosphonate therapy in patients who require a lower surgical intervention, the risk of osteondrosis of the jaw diminishes.</seg>

<seg id="1319">In the phase III trials, the mean climbs of the BMD with Alendronat were 10 mg / day compared to placebo after 3 years 8.8% on the spine, 5.9% on the femur and 7.8% at the Trochanter.</seg>
<seg id="1320">In the group treated with Alendronat, a 48% reduction in the placebo group was achieved (Alendronat 3.2% versus placebo 6.2%) in the proportion of patients who suffered one or more vertebral fractures.</seg>
<seg id="1321">In the two-year extension of these studies, the stimulus of the BMD of the spine and the trophy continued; the BMD of the femoral neck and the entire body was maintained.</seg>
<seg id="1322">Fit consisted of two placebo-controlled studies, in which Alendronat was taken daily (5 mg daily for 2 years and then 10 mg daily, either over 1 or 2 years):</seg>
<seg id="1323">In this study, the daily dose of Alendronat reduced the appearance of at least one new vertebrate fracture by 47% (Alendronat 7.9% versus placebo 15.0%).</seg>
<seg id="1324">Absorption Beading on an intravenous reference dose was the mean oral bioavailability of alendron at women 0,64% for doses between 5 and 70 mg at night fasting and two hours before starting a standardised breakfast.</seg>
<seg id="1325">Bioavailability increased correspondingly to approximately 0.46% and 0.39% when Alendronat was taken half an hour before a standardised breakfast.</seg>
<seg id="1326">In osteoporosis Alendronat was effective if it was taken at least 30 minutes before the first meal or drink of the day.</seg>
<seg id="1327">In healthy volunteers, oral prednisone (20 mg three times daily for five days) led to no clinically meaningful change in the oral bioavailability of alendron (increase in average in the range from 20% to 44%).</seg>
<seg id="1328">9 Distribution studies on rats showed that after intravenous administration of 1 mg / kg, alendronat is temporarily distributed in soft tissues, but then quickly dispersed into the bone or excreted with urine.</seg>
<seg id="1329">Excretion After intravenous administration of a single dose of 14C alendron, about 50% of the radioactive substance were excreted within 72 hours with the urine and little or no radioactivity was found in the threads.</seg>
<seg id="1330">After intravenous administration of a single dose of 10 mg, the renal Clearance of Alendronat was 71 ml / min and systemic Clearance did not exceed 200 ml / min.</seg>
<seg id="1331">In rats, Alendronat is not excreted via the kidneys or the basic transport system of the kidneys and is therefore not believed to affect the excretion of other medicines by these means of transport.</seg>

<seg id="1336">Characteristics of patients with preclinical studies have shown that the portion of alendron, which is not deposited in the bone, is quickly excreted via the urine.</seg>
<seg id="1337">Although there are no clinical data about it, it is nonetheless expected that the renal elimination of alendron as in animal studies will also be reduced in patients with reduced kidney function.</seg>

<seg id="1403">Furthermore, the results of a clinical study were submitted to 668 patients with kidney transplantation, compared with the application of Advagraph with Prograf / Prograft or Ciclosporin.</seg>
<seg id="1404">The main indicator of efficacy was the number of patients in which the transplant was rejected after one year (by examining how often a renewed organ transplant or resumption of dialysis was necessary).</seg>
<seg id="1405">In addition, more recently, 119 patients with kidney transplantation and 129 patients with liver transplantation were carried out and examined how Advagraph is absorbed by the body compared to Prograf / Prograft.</seg>

<seg id="1410">Only doctors who are familiar with immunosuppressive therapy and the treatment of transplant patients should prescribe this medicine or make changes in immunosuppressive therapy.</seg>
<seg id="1411">Due to clinically relevant differences in systemic exposure of tacrolimus, this can lead to graft rejection or increased incidence of side effects, including under- or immunosuppression.</seg>
<seg id="1412">Patients should always maintain the same tacrolimus formulation and the corresponding daily dosage; formulations of the formulation or the regime should only be carried out under the tight control of a doctor experienced in transplantation (see Sections 4.4 and 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="1413">As a result of a switch to an alternative formulation, a therapeutic drug monitoring and appropriate dose adjustments must be carried out to ensure that the systemic exposure of tacrolimus remains intact.</seg>
<seg id="1414">The dosage of Advagraph should be based primarily on the clinical assessment of rejection and tolerability in individual cases and on blood level (see below "Recommendations</seg>
<seg id="1415">After switching from Prograf to Advagraf, the tacrolimus-valley levels should be controlled before the changeover and over two weeks after conversion.</seg>
<seg id="1416">On Day 4, systemic exposure was comparable to both kidney and liver transplanted patients with both formulations.</seg>
<seg id="1417">Careful and repeated checks of tacrolimus-sebum levels are recommended during the first two weeks after transplantation under Advagraph to ensure proper substance exposure in the immediate post-transplantation phase.</seg>
<seg id="1418">Since tacrolimus is a low clearance substance, an adjustment of the advagraph can take several days before the steady state is reached.</seg>

<seg id="1420">Duration of application To suppress the graft rejection, immunosuppression must be maintained; consequently, a maximum duration of oral therapy cannot be specified.</seg>
<seg id="1421">Dosage recommendations - kidney transplantation Prophylaxis of graft rejection The oral Advagraph therapy should begin with 0.20 - 0,30 mg / kg / day as a once daily dose in the morning.</seg>
<seg id="1422">Further dose adjustments may later be necessary as the pharmacokinetics of tacrolimus can change in the course of stabilising the patient after the transplant.</seg>
<seg id="1423">Dosage recommendations - liver transplantation Prophylaxis of graft rejection The oral Advagraph therapy should begin with 0.10 - 0.20 mg / kg / day as a once daily dose in the morning.</seg>
<seg id="1424">Dosage recommendation - Conversion from Prograf to Advagraph Must be converted to a once daily intake of Prograf capsules to a once daily intake of Prograf capsules, so this conversion has to take place in relation 1: 1 (mg: mg), based on the total daily dose.</seg>
<seg id="1425">Kidney and liver transplantation After switching from other immunosuppressiva to Advansf once daily, the treatment with the oral initial dose recommended in kidney and liver transplant must begin for prophylaxis of graft rejection.</seg>
<seg id="1426">Transplantation In adult patients who are converted to Advantages, an oral initial dose of 0.15 mg / kg / day is taken daily in the morning.</seg>
<seg id="1427">Other transplant recipients, although there is no clinical experience with advagraf in lung, pancreatic, and intestine transplanted patients, was used in oral initial dosage of 0.10 - 0.15 mg / kg / day, for pancreatic transplanted patients in an oral initial dose of 0.3 mg / kg / day.</seg>
<seg id="1428">Dosage adjustments in specific patient groups patients with reduced liver function For the maintenance of cerebrospinal fluid in the targeted area, a reduction of the dose may be necessary in patients with severe liver dysfunctions.</seg>
<seg id="1429">Patients with reduced kidney function Since renal function does not affect the pharmacokinetics of tacrolimus, it can be assumed that dosage adjustment is not necessary.</seg>
<seg id="1430">Due to the nephrotoxic potential of tacrolimus, however, a careful monitoring of the renal function (including a regular determination of the serum caratinine levels, a calculation of the corneal inscription and a monitoring of urinary volume) is recommended.</seg>
<seg id="1431">Switch from Ciclosporin to Advagraf When converting from a Ciclosporine to a tacrolimus-based therapy, caution is advised (see Sections 4.4 and 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1432">Recommendations on the level in full blood The dose should primarily be based on the clinical assessment of rejection and tolerability in individual cases with the help of thoroughbred tacrolimus-level control.</seg>
<seg id="1433">It is recommended to perform common controls of tacrolimus platelets during the first two weeks after transplantation followed by periodic checks during maintenance therapy.</seg>
<seg id="1434">Blood level of tacrolimus should also be controlled after switching from Prograf to Advagraph, dosage adjustment, changes in immunosuppressant therapy or simultaneous use of substances that could alter the tacrolimus full blood concentration (see Section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1435">Since Advagraf is a drug with a low clearances, adaptations of the dose may require several days before Steady State has entered.</seg>
<seg id="1436">The clinical trials data suggest that successful treatment is possible in most cases when the levels in the blood do not exceed 20 ng / ml.</seg>
<seg id="1437">In clinical practice, the level of tacrolimus in the whole blood is usually in the area of 5 - 20 ng / ml and with kidney and heart transplanted patients at 10 - 20 ng / ml.</seg>
<seg id="1438">During the subsequent maintenance therapy of liver, kidney and heart transplant recipients blood concentrations were generally used in the range of 5 - 15 ng / ml.</seg>
<seg id="1439">This has led to serious adverse events, including graft rejection or other side effects, which can occur as a result of tacrolimus under- or overexposure.</seg>
<seg id="1440">Patients should always maintain the same tacrolimus formulation and the corresponding daily dosage; formulations of the formulation or the regime should only be carried out under the tight control of a doctor experienced in transplantation (see sections 4.2 and 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="1441">5 For the treatment of adult patients with graft rejection, which proved to be resistant to other immunosuppressants, no clinical data is available for the retarded formulation Advagraph.</seg>
<seg id="1442">To prophylaxis of graft rejection in adult heart transplant recipients and transplant recipients in childhood there are still no clinical data for the retarded formulation Advagraf.</seg>
<seg id="1443">Because of possible interactions that may lead to a lowering of the tacrolimus levels in the blood and a weakening of the clinical effect of tacrolimus, the intake of herbal supplements containing St. John's wort (Hypericum perforatum) or other herbal remedies should be avoided during a treatment with Advagraph (see Section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1444">In patients with diarrhoea, a particularly careful monitoring of the tacrolimus concentrations in the blood is offered as the tacrolimus blood levels can be subject to considerable fluctuations under such circumstances.</seg>
<seg id="1445">In rare cases, a cardiomyopathy referred to as cardio-hypertrophy referred to as cardiomyopathy, which can therefore also occur under Advagraph.</seg>
<seg id="1446">Other factors that increase the risk of such clinical disorders are an already existing heart disease, treatment with corticosteroids, hypertension, kidney or liver dysfunction, infection, fluid overload, and oedema.</seg>
<seg id="1447">As with other immunosuppressants, exposure to sunlight or UV light should be limited due to the potential risk of malignant skin lesions due to suitable clothing or use of a sunscreen with a high protection factor.</seg>
<seg id="1448">If patients taking tacrolimus have symptoms for PRES like headaches, altered states of consciousness, convulsions and blurred vision, a radiological examination (e.g.</seg>

<seg id="1450">The simultaneous use of medicines or herbal remedies known as inhibitors or inductors of CYP3A4 can affect the metabolism of tacrolimus and consequently increase or lower the blood values of tacrolimus.</seg>
<seg id="1451">Therefore, it is advisable to monitor the tacrolimus blood level with the simultaneous administration of substances that can change the CYP3A metabolism and adjust the tacrolimus dose to maintain even concentrations (see sections 4.2 and 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1452">A strongly distinctive interaction was associated with antimycotic such as ketoconazole, fluconazole, itraconazole and voriconazole as well as with the Macrolid antibiotic erythromycin and HIV protease inhibitors (z).</seg>
<seg id="1453">Pharmacokinetics studies showed that the increase in blood levels results mainly from the elevated oral bioavailability of tacrolimus, caused by the inhibition of gastrointestinal metabolism.</seg>
<seg id="1454">Highly dosed prednisolone or methylprednisolone, as used in acute rejection reactions, can increase or lower the concentration of tacrolimus in the blood.</seg>
<seg id="1455">The effect of tacrolimus on the metabolism of other medicines Tacrolimus is known as CYP3A4-inhibitor; therefore, the simultaneous application of tacrolimus with medicines which are metabolized by CYP3A4 can affect their metabolism.</seg>
<seg id="1456">Since Tacrolimus can reduce the clearing of steroid-contraceptives and thus increase hormone exposure, it is particularly careful when making decisions about contraceptive measures.</seg>
<seg id="1457">The results of animal experiments have shown that tacrolimus can potentially lessen the Clearance of Pentobarbital and Phenazon and prolong their half-life.</seg>
<seg id="1458">The results of a small number of transplant patients do not suggest that in comparison to other immunosuppressants, tacrolimus is an increased risk of adverse events with regard to the course and outcome of pregnancy.</seg>
<seg id="1459">In the case of utero exposure, a monitoring of the newborn on potential harmful effects of tacrolimus (especially regarding its effect on the kidneys) is recommended.</seg>

<seg id="1465">Infections and parasitic diseases In other highly effective immunosuppressants, patients who are treated with tacrolimus have often increased susceptibility to infections (viral, bacterial, mycotic, protozoa).</seg>
<seg id="1466">Cases of BK-Virus associated nephropathy and JC Virus associated progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) were reported in patients under immunosuppression therapy, including therapy with Advagraph.</seg>
<seg id="1467">It was reported about benign or malignant neoplasms including EBV- associated lymphoproliferative diseases and skin tumours in combination with treatment with tacrolimus.</seg>
<seg id="1468">Due to its high molecular weight, its low water solubility and the high binding of erythrocytes and plasma proteins, it can be assumed that tacrolimus is not dialyitiable.</seg>
<seg id="1469">The mechanism of action and pharmacodynamic effects on the molecular level may be mediated by the effects of tacrolimus through its binding to a Cytosolean protein (FKBP12), which is responsible for the enrichment of the connection in the nucleus.</seg>
<seg id="1470">This leads to a calciumdependent inhibition of signal transduction in the T cell, thus preventing the transcription of a certain series of lymphocytes genes.</seg>
<seg id="1471">Tacrolimus suppresses the activation of T cells and the proliferation of B cells dependent on T-helper cells, further the formation of lymphocytes (such as interleukin-2, interleukin-3 and γ-interferon) as well as the expression of the interleukin-2 receptor.</seg>
<seg id="1472">12 confirmed acute repellations in the first 24 weeks in the Advagraph Group (N = 237) 32.6% and in the Prograf-group (N = 234) 29.3%.</seg>

<seg id="1478">The treatment difference was -3.0% (Advagraf- Ciclosporin) (95.2% confidence interval [-9.9%, 4.0%]) for Advagraf vs Ciclosporin and -1.9% (95.2% confidence interval [-8.9%, 5.2%]) for Prograf vs Ciclosporin.</seg>
<seg id="1479">In the Advagraph arm there were 3 (men), in the Prograf-Arm 10 (3 women, 7 men) and in the Ciclosporin arm 6 (3 females, 3 men) deaths.</seg>
<seg id="1480">Published results of primary immunosuppression with tacrolimus in the form of twice daily used Prograf capsules after other primary organ transplants Prograf has developed into a recognized primary immunosuppressant after pancreatic, lung and intestinal transplantations.</seg>
<seg id="1481">Patient-transplant patients, in 475 patients who had undergone a pancreatic transplantation and in 630 cases after an intestinal transplant, were used as primary immunosuppressant.</seg>
<seg id="1482">Overall, the safety profile of oral Prograf was consistent with these published studies in the major studies in which Prograf was used for liver, kidney and heart transplant recipients to primary immunosuppression.</seg>
<seg id="1483">Lung transplantation In an interim analysis of a recently conducted, multicenter study with oral programme was reported over 110 patients who received either tacrolimus or ciclosporin in 1: 1 randomization.</seg>
<seg id="1484">Chronic graft rejection, bronchiolitis obliterans- syndrome, was less common in the first year after transplantation (2.86% versus 8,57%).</seg>
<seg id="1485">Survival rate after one year was 80.8% in the Tacrolimus- and 83% in the Ciclosporin group (Treede et al., 3rd ICI San Diego, USA, 2004; Abstract 22).</seg>
<seg id="1486">In the patients treated with Tacrolimus, it came to 21.7% of the cases for the development of bronchiolitis obliterans compared to 38.0% under Ciclosporin (p = 0,025).</seg>
<seg id="1487">The number of cases where Ciclosporin had to be switched to tacrolimus (n = 13) was significantly greater (p = 0.02) than the number of patients enacted by tacrolimus on Ciclosporin (n = 2) (Keenan et al., Ann Thoracic Surg 1995; 60: 580).</seg>
<seg id="1488">The number of cases in which there was no acute graft rejection was greater after 6 months (57.7% versus 45.8%) and after 1 year (50% versus 33.3%) in lung transplanted patients of the Tacrolimus Group (Treede et al., J Heart Lung Transplant 2001; 20: 511).</seg>
<seg id="1489">In one study the incidence of a bronchiolitis obliterative syndrome in the patients treated with Tacrolimus was significantly lower.</seg>
<seg id="1490">Pankreastransplantation A multi-center study with oral Prograf was conducted to 205 patients receiving a pancreas and kidney transplantation, receiving a randomised trial of tacrolimus (n = 103) or Ciclosporin (n = 102).</seg>
<seg id="1491">The oral initial dose (per protocol) of tacrolimus was 0,2 mg / kg / day and was then reached to reach the target level of 8 to 15 ng / ml on 5.</seg>
<seg id="1492">The published clinical results of a monocentric clinical study with oral Prograf as the primary immunosuppressant after intestinal transplants showed an acute survival rate of 75% after 1 year, 5% after 5 years and 42% after 10 years.</seg>
<seg id="1493">Early detection methods of Epstein-Barr (EBV) - and CMV infections, bone marrow augmentation, additional addition of the interleukin-2 antagonist Daclizumab, lower initial doses of 10 and 15 ng / ml and recently transplant radiation (Abu-Elmagd et al., Ann Surg 2001; 234: 404).</seg>
<seg id="1494">Factors such as low haematocrit and low protein concentrations, leading to an increase in the unbound group of tacrolimus, or a reinforcement of metabolism caused by corticosteroids should be responsible for the higher clearances observed after the transplant.</seg>
<seg id="1495">This suggests that tacrolimus is almost completely metabolized before excretion, whereby the excretion occurs mainly via the bile.</seg>
<seg id="1496">The systemic exposure of Tacrolimus (AUC0-24) under Advagraph was approximately 10% lower compared with Prograf for stable patients, which were converted from Prograf (twice daily) to the total daily dose.</seg>
<seg id="1497">It is recommended to perform common controls of tacrolimus platelets during the first two weeks after transplantation followed by periodic checks during maintenance therapy.</seg>

<seg id="1530">Advocate is used to treat and prevent bleeding in patients with hemophilia A (a congenital blood clotting disorder caused by the lack of factor VIII.</seg>
<seg id="1531">The dosage and frequency of the application depends on whether advocate is used to treat bleeding or to prevent bleeding during surgical procedures.</seg>
<seg id="1532">Patients with haemophilia A suffer from a factor VIII deficiency that causes blood clots such as bleeding in joints, muscles or internal organs.</seg>
<seg id="1533">Octocog alfa is not extracted from human plasma but produced by a method called "recombinant DNA technology":</seg>
<seg id="1534">It is produced by a cell in which a gene (DNA) is inserted, which enables it to form the human coagulation factor VIII.</seg>
<seg id="1535">Advocate is similar to another medicine approved in the European Union named Recombinate, but is manufactured differently so that the medicine does not contain proteins or animal origin.</seg>
<seg id="1536">In three additional studies in patients with severe to moderate haemophilia A, including a study of 53 children under six years, the use of the drug was examined for the prevention of bleeding and surgical procedures.</seg>
<seg id="1537">In the main study, the efficacy of Advent in the prevention of bleeding in 86% of 510 new bleeding periods was "excellent" or "good."</seg>
<seg id="1538">The most common side effects of Advent (observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients) are dizziness, headache, pyrexia (fever) and the formation of antibodies against factor VIII.</seg>
<seg id="1539">Advocate may not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to human coagulation factor VIII, mouse or hamster protein, or any of the other ingredients.</seg>
<seg id="1540">In March 2004, the European Commission granted the company Baxter AG an approval for the placing of Advent in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="1541">Dosage and duration of substitution treatment depend on the degree of severity of Factor VIII deficiency, on location and extent of bleeding and clinical condition of the patient.</seg>
<seg id="1542">In the case of the following hämorrhagic events, factor VIII activity should not fall below the specified plasma levels (in% of the norm, or I.E. / dl).</seg>
<seg id="1543">Repeat all 12-24 hours (8-24 hours in patients under 6) for 3-4 days or more until pain and acute pain are eliminated.</seg>
<seg id="1544">Repeat all 8-24 hours (6-12 hours in patients under 6) until the risk for the patient is over.</seg>
<seg id="1545">During treatment course, appropriate determination of factor VIII plasma levels is recommended for controlling the dose and frequency of injections to be administered.</seg>
<seg id="1546">Individual patients may differ in their reactions to factor VIII, achieve different in vivo recovery and exhibit different half-value times.</seg>
<seg id="1547">3 Prophylaxis for long-term prophylaxis of bleeding in patients with severe hemophilia A should be given doses between 20 and 40 I.U. of factor VIII per kg body weight at a distance of 2-3 days.</seg>
<seg id="1548">If the expected factor VIII plasma activity cannot be reached or if the bleeding is not controlled with a reasonable dose, a test must be performed to detect an inhibitor if necessary.</seg>
<seg id="1549">In patients with high inhibitors it is possible that factor VIII therapy is not effective, so that other therapeutic measures must be considered.</seg>
<seg id="1550">The transfer rate should be based upon finding the patient, with a maximum injection rate of 10 ml / min should not be exceeded.</seg>
<seg id="1551">The formation of neutralizing antibodies (inhibitors) against factor VIII is a well known complication in treating patients with hemophilia A.</seg>
<seg id="1552">These inhibitors are always against the prokoagulatory activity of IgG immunoglobulins, which are quantified in Bethesda units (B.E.) per ml of plasma using modified Bethesda assay.</seg>
<seg id="1553">The risk of developing inhibitors correlates with the extent of exposure to factor VIII, whereby the risk within the first 20 exposure days is greatest and depends on genetic and other factors.</seg>
<seg id="1554">In previously treated patients (PTPs) with more than 100 exposure days and anamnestic known inhibitors development, after switching from a recombinant factor VIII product to another, the reoccurrence of (lowly) inhibitors was observed.</seg>
<seg id="1555">Due to the rare occurrence of hemophilia A in women, there are no experiences regarding the use of factor VIII during pregnancy and lactation.</seg>
<seg id="1556">The ADRs that occur in the largest number of patients were inhibitors against factor VIII (5 patients), all of which were previously untreated patients with a higher risk of inhibiting the formation of inhibitors, headaches (5 patients), fever and dizziness (3 patients each).</seg>
<seg id="1557">Very common (≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10), occasionally (≥ 1 / 1,000 to &lt; 1 / 100), rare (≥ 1 / 10,000 to &lt; 1 / 1,000), very rarely (≥ 1 / 10,000), not known (frequency based on available data cannot be estimated).</seg>
<seg id="1558">A) The percentage of patients was calculated using the sum of the individual patients (234). the unexpected drop in the blood clotting factor VIII was performed postoperatively in a patient under continuous ADVICATE infusion (10 - 14 postoperative day).</seg>
<seg id="1559">Blood clotting was maintained throughout the period and both the factor VIII- Mirrors in the plasma as well as the Clearance rate showed sufficient readings on the 15th postoperatively day.</seg>
<seg id="1560">In clinical trials with ADVATE on 145 children and adults 2 with diagnosed heavy to moderate haemophilia A (FVIII ≤ 2%) and previous exposure to factor VIII- concentrates (≥ 150 days) only one patient showed a low inhibitory (2.4 B.E. in the modified Bethesda approach) after 26 exposure days.</seg>
<seg id="1561">In addition, at none of the 53 paediatric patients with an age of under 6 years and diagnosed heavy to moderate haemophilia A (FVIII ≤ 2%) after previous exposure to factor VIII- concentrates (≥ 50 days) a FVIII inhibitor was established.</seg>
<seg id="1562">In previously untreated patients with an ongoing clinical trial, 5 out of 25 (20%) with ADVATE treated patients inhibitors against factor VIII.</seg>
<seg id="1563">The immune response of patients to traces of contaminated proteins was analysed by investigating the antibody titers against these proteins, laboratory parameters, and reported side effects.</seg>
<seg id="1564">One patient showed a statistically significant upward trend as well as a persistent peak of the antibody level against anti-CHO cell protein, otherwise there were no signs or symptoms indicative of an allergic reaction or hypersensitivity.</seg>
<seg id="1565">In four patients the incidence of urticaria, pruritus, skin rash and increased number of eosinophilic granulocytes was reported in several repeated product expositions within the study.</seg>

<seg id="1638">Based on the data available since the first release, CHMP continues to evaluate the benefits-risk assessment as positive, but considered that the safety profile must be closely monitored for the following reasons:</seg>
<seg id="1639">Therefore CHMP has decided on the basis of the security profile of ADVATE, which makes a filing of PSURs every 6 months, decided that the authorisation holder should apply for another renewal process within 5 years.</seg>
<seg id="1640">In December 2008, Gendux Molecular Limited granted the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) that the company resumes its application for the marketing of Advexin for the treatment of Li-Fraumeni cancer.</seg>
<seg id="1641">Normally, however, the breast, the brain, the bones or the soft tissues (tissues that connect, surrounds and supports other structures in the body) are affected.</seg>
<seg id="1642">This is a kind of virus that has been genetically modified in such a way that it can carry a gene into the cells of the body.</seg>
<seg id="1643">The virus in Advexin is a "Adenovirus" that has been changed in such a way that it does not produce copies of itself and thus cannot trigger infections in humans.</seg>
<seg id="1644">Advanin would have been injected directly into the tumors, enabling cancer cells to re-form the normal p53 protein.</seg>
<seg id="1645">The p53 protein, which is formed from the non-defective p53 gene present in the human body, usually contributes to the recovery of damaged DNA and to kill the cells when the DNA cannot be recovered.</seg>
<seg id="1646">In case of Li-Fraumeni-cancer, where the p53 gene is defective, the p53 protein does not work properly, and the cancer cells can continue to grow and share.</seg>
<seg id="1647">The company presented data from a study with a patient, with the Li-Fraumeni cancer in the abdominal area, bones and brain.</seg>
<seg id="1648">After the CHMP checked the company's answers to the questions posed to him, some questions were still unanswered.</seg>
<seg id="1649">Based on the review of the initial submitted documents, CHMP generates a list of questions sent to the company on Day 120.</seg>
<seg id="1650">According to the CHMP opinion, it was not sufficiently demonstrated that the injection of Advexin in Li-Fraumeni-Tumore brings advantages for the patients.</seg>
<seg id="1651">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "the committee also had concerns about the processing of the medicine in the body, the type of administration and the safety of the medicine." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1652">Moreover, the company has not sufficiently demonstrated that Advexin can be manufactured in a reliable way and that it is harmful neither for the environment nor for people who come in close contact with the patient.</seg>
<seg id="1653">The company did not inform the CHMP whether the withdrawal will have consequences for patients who are currently participating in clinical trials or "compassionate use" programmes with Advexin.</seg>
<seg id="1654">"altered mode of action" means that the tablets are composed so that one of the effective components is released immediately and the other slowly over a few hours.</seg>
<seg id="1655">Aerinaze is used to treat the symptoms of seasonal allergic rhinitis (hay fever caused by an allergy to pollen (nasal passages) in patients with nasal mucous swelling (clogged nose).</seg>
<seg id="1656">In adults and adolescents from 12 years onwards, the recommended dose of aerosols is twice daily a tablet, which should be taken completely with a glass of water with or without food.</seg>
<seg id="1657">The duration of the treatment should be as short as possible and terminated as soon as the symptoms, especially the swelling of the nasal mucosa (clogged nose), are abbreviated.</seg>
<seg id="1658">A treatment duration of more than 10 days is not recommended because the effects of the medicine can be relieved on the constipation of the nose.</seg>
<seg id="1659">The main effect measurements were changes in the severity of the hay fever symptoms reported by the patients prior to the treatment and during the 15-day treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1660">During the study, patients carried out their symptoms every 12 hours in a diary and evaluated with a standard scale how severe the symptoms were in the last 12 hours.</seg>
<seg id="1661">When examining all hay fever symptoms except the constipation of the nose, the patients who received aerosaze reported a decrease in the symptoms by 46.0% compared with 35.9% among the patients who took pseudoephedrine alone.</seg>
<seg id="1662">If only the swelling of the nasal mucosa was seen, the patients under aerinaze showed a relief of the symptoms by 37,4% compared to 26.7% in the patients who received the desloratadine alone.</seg>
<seg id="1663">The most common side effects of aerosaze (observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients) are tachycardia, dry mouth, dizziness, psychomotor hyperactivity (restlessness), constipation, headache, fatigue, insomnia (sleeplessness), somnolence (somnolency), sleep disorders and nervousness.</seg>
<seg id="1664">Aerinaze may not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to desloratadine, pseudoephedrine or any of the other components, against adrenergic active substances or loratadine (other drugs used to treat allergies).</seg>
<seg id="1665">Aerinaze may not be used in patients suffering from a narrow angle glaucoma (hypertension), cardiac or vascular diseases, including hypertension (hypertension), hyperthyreosis (stroke) or a haemorrhagic stroke (stroke) or a risk of haemorrhagic stroke.</seg>
<seg id="1666">On 30 July 2007, the European Commission granted the SP Europe approval to transport aerosols across the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="1667">The tablet can be taken with a glass of water, but can be swallowed whole (i.e. without breaking it, breaking or chew).</seg>
<seg id="1668">Aerinaze should not be used for children under 12 years due to the lack of data on safety and efficacy (see paragraph 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1669">The duration of the application is as short as possible and should not be continued after the symptoms finish.</seg>
<seg id="1670">It is recommended to limit the duration of use to 10 days, as long-term application can decrease the activity of pseudoephedrine over time.</seg>
<seg id="1671">After decrease of the swelling of the mucous membranes in the upper respiratory tract, treatment can be continued as a monotherapy if required.</seg>
<seg id="1672">Since aerinaze contains pseudoephedrine, the medicine is also contraindicated in patients treated with a monoaminoxidase (MAO) inhibitor respectively within 2 weeks of end treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1673">This is due to alphamimetic activity in combined use of pseudoephedrine with other vasoconstrictors such as bromocriptin, bromocripine, cabarolin, ergotamine, dihydroergotamine or other deongestive (phenylpropanolamine, phenylephrine, ephedrine, oxymetazoline, naphazolin, etc.).</seg>
<seg id="1674">The safety and efficacy of this combination therapy were not tested for this group of patients and the data is not sufficient to address appropriate dosage recommendations.</seg>
<seg id="1675">The safety and efficacy of aerosols were not tested in patients with kidney or liver dysfunction and the data is insufficient to address appropriate dosage recommendations.</seg>
<seg id="1676">Patients must be informed that treatment in case of hypertension or tachycardia or palpitations, heart rhythm disorders, nausea or any other neurological symptoms (such as headaches or a strengthening of headaches) must be dismissed.</seg>
<seg id="1677">The treatment of the following patient groups is recommended: • Patients with cardiac arrhythmia • Patients with hypertension • Patients with a myocardial infarction in anamnesis, diabetes mellitus, bladder neck construction or bronchospasm in anamnesis.</seg>
<seg id="1678">Aerinaze is required at least 48 hours before performing dermatological tests, as antihistamines otherwise prevent positive reactions to indicators of skin reactions or reduce them to their extent.</seg>
<seg id="1679">In the course of clinical exams with a loratadine, in which erythromycin or ketoconazole were administered in addition, no clinically relevant interactions or changes in the plasma concentration of Desloratadine were observed.</seg>
<seg id="1680">The results of the psychomotor test did not show any significant differences between the patients treated with the loratadine and placebo irrespective of whether the loratadine was taken alone or with alcohol.</seg>
<seg id="1681">The enzyme responsible for the metabolism of the loradine has not yet been identified, so that interaction with other medicines can not be completely ruled out.</seg>
<seg id="1682">Desloratadine does not inhibit CYP3A4 in vivo, and in-vitro studies have shown that the drug CYP2D6 is not inhibiting and neither a substrate nor an inhibitor of the P-glycoproteins.</seg>
<seg id="1683">The safety of the application of aerosol during pregnancy is not assured, but experiences gained from a large number of affected pregnancies did not increase the frequency of abnormalities in comparison to the frequency of the normal population.</seg>
<seg id="1684">Since reproduction studies on animals cannot always be transferred to humans and, due to the vasoconstricting properties of pseudoephedrine, aerinaze should not be used in pregnancy.</seg>
<seg id="1685">However, patients should be informed that in very rare cases it may lead to drowsiness, which may lead to an impairment of traffic tightness or the ability to operate machinery.</seg>
<seg id="1686">The symptoms can vary between a CNS depression (sedation, apnea, decreased mental alertness, cyanosis, coma, cardiovascular collapse) and a CNS stimulation (sleeplessness, hallucinations, tremor, convulsions) with possible latinal processes.</seg>
<seg id="1687">Headaches, anxiety, difficult miction, muscle weakness and increased muscle tension, euphoria, arousal, respiratory failure, heart rhythm disorders, tachycardia, nausea, vomiting, precordiale pain, dizziness, tinnitus, ataxia, vision disturbances and hypertension or hypotonia.</seg>
<seg id="1688">A CNS stimulation is particularly probable in children, as well as atropine typical symptoms (dry mouth, pupil rigidity and - dilatation, reddening, hyperthermia and gastrointestinal symptoms).</seg>
<seg id="1689">These include both inhibiting the release of inflammatory cytokines such as IL-4, IL-6, IL-8 and IL-13 from human mast cells / basophiles as well as the inhibition of the expression of the adhesion molecules P-selectin on endothelial cells.</seg>
<seg id="1690">In a single dose study with adults, the loratadine showed 5 mg no influence on standard measurement parameters of the flight performance, including the amplification of subjective drowsiness or the tasks associated with flying.</seg>
<seg id="1691">In controlled clinical trials, at the recommended dosage of 5 mg. a day no increased frequency of drowsiness was determined compared to placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1692">The oral application of pseudoephedrine in the recommended dosage can cause further sympathomimetic effects, such as an increase in blood pressure, a tachycardia or manifestations of CNS arousal.</seg>
<seg id="1693">1,248 patients aged between 12 and 78 years with seasonal allergic rhinitis were involved, with 414 patients receiving aerosaze tablets.</seg>
<seg id="1694">In both studies the histamine antagonistic activity of aerinaze tablets was significantly higher than under a monotherapy with pseudoephedrine over the 2-week treatment period.</seg>
<seg id="1695">The efficacy of aerosaze tablets with regard to the anti-swelling effect, determined on the basis of the nasal mucosal swelling, was significantly higher than under a monotherapy with a disloratadine over the 2-week treatment period.</seg>
<seg id="1696">The efficacy of aerosaze tablets did not show any significant differences with regard to gender, age or ethnicity.</seg>
<seg id="1697">As part of a single dose study on the pharmacokinetics of aerinaze, desloratadine is detectable within 30 minutes after administration.</seg>
<seg id="1698">After the peroral application of aerinaze in healthy subjects over 14 days, the flow balance of Desloratadine, 3-Hydroxydesloratadine and Pseudoephedrine was reached on Day 10.</seg>
<seg id="1699">Within the scope of a pharmacokinetic multiple dose study conducted with the formulation as a tablet in healthy adult subjects, it was found that four test persons had bad metabolism.</seg>
<seg id="1700">A component interaction study shows that exposure (cmax and AUC) of pseudoephedrine after the sole gift of pseudoephedrine bio-equivalent was to exposure to an aerosaze tablet.</seg>
<seg id="1701">Based on conventional studies on safety harmacology, toxicity with repeated application, genotoxicity and reproductive toxicity, however, the preclinical data with the loratadine does not reveal any particular dangers to humans.</seg>
<seg id="1702">The combination had no greater toxicity than its individual components, and the observed effects were generally related to the ingredient Pseudoephedrine.</seg>
<seg id="1703">In reproductive toxicological studies the combination of loratadine / pseudoephedrine was not teratogenic in the oral administration of rats in a dose of up to 150 mg / kg / day and in rabbits at a dose of up to 120 mg / kg / day.</seg>
<seg id="1704">March 2007 and the Pharmacovigilance system described in Module 1.8.1 of the application for authorisation is established and works before and while the product is on the market.</seg>
<seg id="1705">Antihistamines contribute to the alleviation of the allergic symptoms by preventing histamine, a body's own substance, its effect.</seg>
<seg id="1706">Aerinaze tablets alleviate symptoms associated with seasonal allergic rhinitis (hay fever) such as sneezing, running or itchy nose and tearing or itchy eyes while constipating the nose.</seg>

<seg id="1709">Tell your doctor if the following symptoms or conditions are diagnosed or diagnosed in the application of aerosol: • high blood pressure • heart hunting, palpitations • heart rhythm disorders • nausea and headaches or a strengthening of existing headaches.</seg>
<seg id="1710">If you are taking Aerinaze with other medicines, please inform your doctor or pharmacist if you have taken other medicines or have taken it until recently, even if it is not prescription medicine.</seg>
<seg id="1711">Used in the recommended dosage, it is not to be expected that aerinax leads to dizziness or decreases attention.</seg>

<seg id="1717">After the market launch of Desloratadine very rarely has been reported cases of severe allergic reactions (shortness of breath, whistling breathing, itching, hives, swelling) or skin rashes.</seg>
<seg id="1718">Cases of heart palpitations, heart hunting, stomach pain, nausea, vomiting, stomach upset, diarrhea, hallucinations, muscular pain, seizures, restlessness with increased physical activity, cases of liver inflammation and cases of conspicuous liver values have also been reported very rarely.</seg>
<seg id="1719">It is available as a 5 mg tablet, 5 mg lyophilisate (soluble tablet), 2.5 Mg and 5 mg melting tablets (tablets which dissolve in the mouth), 0.5 mg / ml syup and as 0.5 mg / ml solution for taking.</seg>
<seg id="1720">For children between one and five years, the dose is 1.25 mg once a day, which is in the form of 2.5 ml syrup.</seg>
<seg id="1721">For children between six and eleven years, the dose is 2.5 mg once daily, either in the form of 5 ml syrup or</seg>
<seg id="1722">AERIUS was examined in eight studies involving around 4 800 adults and adolescents with allergic rhinitis (including four studies in seasonal allergic rhinitis and two studies in patients who also had asthma).</seg>
<seg id="1723">The effectiveness was measured by investigating the change of symptoms (itching, number and size of the squares, sleeping and performance of the day) before and after six weeks of treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1724">Further studies have been submitted in order to prove that the body utilizes the syrup, the solution for inhalation and the melting tablets in the same way as the tablets and application in children is harmless.</seg>
<seg id="1725">In case of allergic rhinitis, when the results of all studies were taken together, the two-week treatment with 5 mg AERIUS resulted in an average decrease of the symptom records (symptom score) by 25 to 32%, compared to the decline of 12 to 26% among the patients receiving a placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1726">In the two studies at Urticaria, the decrease of the symptom severity after six weeks of treatment with AERIUS 58 and 67%, compared with 40 and 33% in patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1727">AERIUS may not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to loratadine, loratadine or any of the other ingredients.</seg>
<seg id="1728">In January 2001, the European Commission granted the SP Europe approval for the placing of AERIUS in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="1729">One tablet once a day, with one or without a meal, to alleviate the symptoms with allergic rhinitis (including intermittent and persistent allergic rhinitis) and Urticaria (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1730">There is limited experience from clinical studies to effectiveness in the application of desloratadine in adolescents from 12 to 17 years (see sections 4.8 and 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1731">The treatment of the intermittent allergic rhinitis (symptoms for less than 4 days a week or less than 4 weeks) should be done according to the present course of the disease and can be resumed after the symptoms end and resume after reappearing.</seg>
<seg id="1732">In the persistent allergic rhinitis (symptoms of 4 or more days a week and more than 4 weeks), the patient can be recommended during the period of the allergy.</seg>
<seg id="1733">Clinically relevant interactions were not found in clinical trials with disloratadine tablets, in which erythromycin or ketoconazole were administered in addition (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1734">In a clinical pharmacological study, the performance of alcohol was not increased while taking AERIUS and alcohol (see Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1735">However, patients should be informed that in very rare cases it may lead to dizziness, which may lead to an impairment of traffic tightness or the ability to operate machinery.</seg>
<seg id="1736">Clinical trials in various indications including rhinitis and chronic idiopathic urticaria were reported at the recommended dose of 5 mg daily 3% more side effects in patients with AERIUS compared to those treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1737">The most frequently encountered adverse events reported more frequently than placebo were tiredness (1.2%), mouth-drought (0.8%) and headache (0,6%).</seg>
<seg id="1738">In a clinical study with 578 adolescent patients from 12 to 17 years, the most common side effect was headaches, which occurred in 5.9% of patients treated with disloratadine and 6.9% of patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1739">Clinically relevant effects were observed in a multi-dose study, administered up to 45 mg of desloratadine (nine times clinical dose).</seg>
<seg id="1740">This includes blocking the release of inflammatory cytokines such as IL-4, IL-6, IL-8 and IL-13 from human mast cells / basophiles as well as the inhibition of the adhesion of the adhesion molecules P-selectin to endothelial cells.</seg>
<seg id="1741">There was no statistically significant or clinically relevant cardiovascular effect as part of a clinical study involving multiple doses of up to 20 mg. a day in a dose of up to 20 mg. a day.</seg>
<seg id="1742">In a clinical pharmacological study, in which the loratadine was administered at a dose of 45 mg daily (the nine times the clinical dose) over ten days, there was no prolongation of the Qtc interval.</seg>
<seg id="1743">In a single dose study with adults, the loratadine showed no influence on standard measurement parameters of the flight performance, including the amplification of subjective drowsiness or the tasks associated with flying.</seg>
<seg id="1744">In patients with allergic rhinitis, AERIUS was effective in relieving symptoms such as sneezing, nasal secretion and itching of the nose, itching, lacrimal drainage and redness of the eyes as well as itching on the palate.</seg>
<seg id="1745">In addition to the established classification in seasonal and perennial, allergic rhinitis can alternatively be divided into intermittent allergic rhinitis and persistent allergic rhinitis.</seg>
<seg id="1746">Intermittent allergic rhinitis is defined as the occurrence of symptoms for less than 4 days a week or less than 4 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="1747">Persistent allergic rhinitis is defined as the onset of symptoms on 4 or more days a week and more than 4 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="1748">As demonstrated by the overall score of the questionnaire on the quality of life of Rhino-conjunctivitis, AERIUS effectively reduces the strain caused by seasonal rhinitis.</seg>
<seg id="1749">The chronically idiopathic urticaria was investigated as a substitute for further forms of urticaria, since the underlying pathophysiology is similar to the different forms and chronic patients can be recruited more easily prospectively.</seg>
<seg id="1750">Because histamines are a causative factor in all urticarial diseases, it is expected that in addition to chronic idiopathic urticaria, the disease also leads to an improvement in the symptoms in other forms of urticaria; this is confirmed by the recommendations of the clinical guidelines.</seg>
<seg id="1751">In two placebo-controlled trials over 6 weeks in patients with chronic idiopathic urticaria, AERIUS was effective in improving pruritus and the reduction of size and number of squares at the end of the first dose interval.</seg>
<seg id="1752">As in other studies with antihistamines in chronic idiopathic urticaria, the majority of patients who did not react to antihistamines were excluded from the study.</seg>
<seg id="1753">Improvement of the itching stimulus by more than 50% was observed in 55% of patients treated with desloratadine compared to 19% of patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1754">The treatment with AERIUS significantly reduced the disturbance of sleep and vigor, as measured by a 4-point scale for evaluating these variables.</seg>
<seg id="1755">In a pharmacokinetics study in which the patient demos were comparable to the general seasonal allergic rhinitis population, 4% of patients have reached a higher concentration of desloratadine.</seg>
<seg id="1756">There are no indications for clinically relevant cumulative accumulation after a daily use of desloratadine (5- 20 mg) for 14 days.</seg>
<seg id="1757">However, the enzyme responsible for the metabolism of the loradine has not yet been identified, so that interaction with other medicines will not be completely eliminated</seg>
<seg id="1758">In-vivo not CYP3A4 and in-vitro studies have shown that the drug CYP2D6 does not inhibit and neither a substrate nor an inhibitor of the P-glycoproteins is.</seg>
<seg id="1759">In a single dose study with a loratadine in a dose of 7.5 mg, meals (fatty, calorie-rich breakfast) did not affect the availability of the loratadine.</seg>
<seg id="1760">The preclinical studies carried out with the loratadine and loratadine showed no qualitative or quantitative differences with regard to the toxicity profile of the loratadine and loratadine.</seg>
<seg id="1761">Based on conventional studies on safety harmacology, toxicity with repeated application, genotoxicity and reproductive toxicity, the preclinical data with the loratadine cannot identify any particular dangers to humans.</seg>

<seg id="1763">AERIUS can be taken independently of meals to relieve the symptoms of allergic rhinitis (including intermittent and persistent allergic rhinitis) and Urticaria (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1764">The prescriber doctor should be aware that most cases of rhinitis in children under 2 years of infection are caused by an infection (see under Section 4.4) and that there are no data available to support a treatment of an infectious Rhinitis with AERIUS.</seg>
<seg id="1765">In addition to the exclusion of upper respiratory tract infections or anatomical anomalies, anamnesis, physical examinations and corresponding laboratory and skin examinations should play a role in the diagnosis.</seg>
<seg id="1766">Approximately 6% of adults and children between 2 and 11 years are metabolising the loratadine and experience higher substance levels (see Section 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="1767">The safety of AERIUS syrup in children between 2 and 11 years that are fully metabolizing is identical to that in children who are normally metabolizing.</seg>
<seg id="1768">This drug contains sucrose and sorbitol; therefore, patients with hereditary problems of fructose intolerance, glucose-galactose absorption inhibitor or saccharase isomaltase deficiency should not take this medicine.</seg>
<seg id="1769">Clinically relevant interactions were not found in clinical studies with AERIUS tablets, in which erythromycin or ketoconazol were administered in addition (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1770">In a clinical pharmacological study, the performance of alcohol was not increased while taking AERIUS tablets and alcohol (see Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1771">The overall frequency of adverse events in children between 2 and 11 years was similar to the AERIUS syrup group similar to the placebo group.</seg>
<seg id="1772">Clinical studies with adults and adolescents in various indications including rhinitis and chronic idiopathic urticaria were reported at the recommended dose of 3% more side effects in patients with AERIUS compared to those treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1773">Clinically relevant effects were observed in a multi-dose study of adults and adolescents, in which up to 45 mg of desic adine (nine times clinical dose) were administered.</seg>
<seg id="1774">Children between the ages of 1 and 11 who were eligible for an antihistamine therapy received a daily dietary supplement of 1.25 mg (aged between 1 and 5 years) or 2.5 mg (aged between 6 and 11 years).</seg>
<seg id="1775">Because the course of allergic rhinitis / chronic idiopathic urticaria and the profile of desloratadine in adults and children are similar, the efficacy data of Desloratadine in adults can be extrapolated to the children's population.</seg>
<seg id="1776">In a clinical study involving multiple doses of adults and adolescents, in which the loratadine was used in a dose of up to 20 mg. a day over 14 days, no statistically significant or clinically relevant cardiovascular effect was described.</seg>
<seg id="1777">In a clinical-pharmacological study of adults and adolescents, in the desloratadine in a dose of 45 mg daily (the nine times the clinical dose) was applied for ten days in adults, there was no prolongation of the Qtc interval.</seg>
<seg id="1778">In controlled clinical trials, at the recommended dosage of 5 mg daily for adults and adolescents, no increased frequency of sleepiness compared to placebo was determined.</seg>
<seg id="1779">In a single daily dose of 7.5 mg AERIUS tablets led to any impairment of psychomotor in clinical trials.</seg>
<seg id="1780">In clinical pharmacological studies in adults, the simultaneous consumption of alcohol has neither resulted in a strengthening of alcohol induced power impairment nor an increase in drowsiness.</seg>
<seg id="1781">In adults and adolescents with allergic rhinitis, AERIUS tablets were effective in relieving symptoms such as sneezing, nasal secretion and itching of the nose, itching, lacrimal drainage and redness of the eyes as well as itching on the palate.</seg>
<seg id="1782">As demonstrated by the total scores of the quality of life of Rhino-conjunctivitis, AERIUS tablets effectively reduce the caused by seasonal rhinitis</seg>
<seg id="1783">In two placebo-controlled trials over 6 weeks in patients with chronic idiopathic urticaria, AERIUS was effective in improving pruritus and the reduction of size and number of squares at the end of the first dose interval.</seg>
<seg id="1784">The spread of this limited-metabolizing phenotype was similar to adults (6%) and children between 2 and 11 years (6%) and in both populations larger in black (18% adults, 16% children) than with Caucasians (2% adults, 3% children).</seg>
<seg id="1785">Similar pharmacokinetic parameters were observed in a pharmacokinetic multi-dose study with syrup formation in children between 2 and 11 years with allergic rhinitis.</seg>
<seg id="1786">The load (AUC) by Desloratadine was about 6 times higher after 3 to 6 hours and the cmax about 3 to 4 times higher with a terminal half-time of approximately 120 hours.</seg>
<seg id="1787">There are no indications for clinically relevant substance accumulation after a daily use of desloratadine (5- 20 mg) over 14 days in adults and adolescents.</seg>
<seg id="1788">12 In different single dose studies, the study showed that both AUC and cmax values were comparable with pediatric patients at the recommended doses with those of adults who received the disloratadine syrup in a dose of 5 mg.</seg>
<seg id="1789">However, the enzyme responsible for the metabolism of the loradine has not yet been identified, so that interaction with other medicines can not be completely ruled out.</seg>

<seg id="1802">In patients with allergic rhinitis, AERIUS tablets were effective in relieving symptoms such as sneezing, nasal secretion and itching of the nose, itching, lacrimal drainage and redness of the eyes as well as itching on the palate.</seg>
<seg id="1803">As demonstrated by the overall score of the questionnaire on the quality of life of Rhino-conjunctivitis, AERIUS effectively reduces the strain caused by seasonal rhinitis.</seg>
<seg id="1804">18 In a pharmacokinetics study in which the patient demos were comparable to the general seasonal allergic rhinitis population, 4% of patients have reached a higher concentration of desloratadine.</seg>

<seg id="1893">In June 2008, Novartis Vaccines and Diagnostics S.r.l. granted the approval of the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) that the company resumes its application for the launch of Aflunov on the prevention of the aviary H5N1 influenza in adults and elderly people.</seg>
<seg id="1894">Aflunov should be used in adults and elderly people to protect against flu caused by the strain (type) H5N1 of the influenza A virus.</seg>
<seg id="1895">This is a special type of vaccine to protect from a strain of the flu virus that could cause future pandemic.</seg>
<seg id="1896">A flu pandemic breaks out when a new strain of the flu virus appears, which can spread easily from man to person, because people have no immunity (no protection) on the other hand.</seg>
<seg id="1897">After administration of the vaccine, the immune system recognises the parts of the influenza virus present in the vaccine as "body foreign" and forms antibodies against it.</seg>
<seg id="1898">As a result, the immune system is able to make antibodies faster in contact with a flu virus in this family.</seg>
<seg id="1899">Subsequently, the membrane cover of the virus with the "surface antigens" (proteins on the membrane surface that recognizes the human body as a foreign body) has been purified, purified and used as part of the vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="1900">An inspection of some of the study sites showed that the study was not carried out according to "good clinical practice" (GCP).</seg>
<seg id="1901">As a result, the scope of the clinical data base for the assessment of the safety of the vaccine was not sufficient to meet the requirements of the EMEA guidelines for prepandemic vaccines.</seg>
<seg id="1902">Should you participate in a clinical trial and require further information about your treatment, please contact your doctor in charge.</seg>
<seg id="1903">If you would like further information on the basis of the CHMP recommendations, please read the scientific discussion (also part of the EPAR).</seg>
<seg id="1904">It is used in combination with other antiviral medicines to treat adults and children over four years, which are infected with the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1), which causes the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS).</seg>
<seg id="1905">For patients who cannot swallow the capsules, Agenerase is available as a solution to intake but it cannot be taken together with Ritonavir because the safety of this combination has not been studied.</seg>
<seg id="1906">Agenerase should only be prescribed if the doctor has examined what antiviral medicines the patient has taken before, and the likelihood has been made that the virus will respond to the medicine.</seg>
<seg id="1907">The recommended dose for patients over twelve years amounts to 600 mg twice daily, which are taken together with twice daily 100 mg of ritonavir and with other antiviral medicines.</seg>
<seg id="1908">In children between four and twelve years and in patients with a body weight of less than 50 kg, the recommended dose of asthma is based on body weight.</seg>
<seg id="1909">In combination with other antiviral medicines, Agenerase reduces the amount of HIV in the blood and keeps it at a low level.</seg>
<seg id="1910">Not to cure AIDS, however, can delay the damage of the immune system and thus also the development of AIDS-related infections and diseases.</seg>
<seg id="1911">Agenerase was studied in combination with other antiviral drugs, but without Ritonavir, in two main studies with 736 HIV-infected adults who had previously not been treated with protease inhibitors.</seg>
<seg id="1912">The drug Agenerase increased with low dosed Ritonavir was compared to other protease inhibitors in 206 adults who had previously taken protease inhibitors.</seg>
<seg id="1913">The main indicator for efficacy was the proportion of patients with non-detectable levels of HIV in the blood (viral load) or the change in the viral load after treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1914">In the studies with patients who had not previously had a protease inhibitor, after 48 weeks in general, more patients had a viral load of 400 copies / ml compared to placebo, but Agenerase was less effective than indinavir.</seg>
<seg id="1915">In children, Agenerase also reduced the viral load, but with the children who had previously been treated with protease inhibitors, only very few responded to the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1916">In the study with adults who had previously been treated with protease inhibitors, the medicine called Ritonavir increased the viral load after 16 weeks of treatment as effective as other protease inhibitors:</seg>
<seg id="1917">In the patients with HIV, which was resistant to four other proteashimids, it came under Agenerase together with Ritonavir to a stronger drop in the viral load after four weeks compared to the patients who continued to take up their former protease inhibitors:</seg>
<seg id="1918">The most common side effects of Agenerase (observed in more than 1 out of 10 patients) are headaches, diarrhoea (diarrhea), flatulence (flatulence), nausea, vomiting, rash and fatigue (fatigue).</seg>
<seg id="1919">2 / 3 Agenerase may not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to amprenavir or any of the other ingredients.</seg>
<seg id="1920">Agenerase may not be used in patients, the St. John's wort (an herbal supplement for the treatment of depression) or medicines, which are decomposed just like asthma and are harmful to health in high concentrations in the blood.</seg>
<seg id="1921">As with other medicines for HIV, there is a risk of lipodystrophy (changes in the distribution of fat), osteonecrosis (death of bone tissue) or immune activation syndrome (symptoms of infection caused by the recovering immune system).</seg>
<seg id="1922">The Committee for Medicinal Products (CHMP) concluded that the benefits of Agenerase when used in combination with other antiretroviral drugs for the treatment of HIV-1 infected adults and children over four years compared to the risks.</seg>
<seg id="1923">Agenerase is usually taken together with the pharmacokinetic amplifiers Ritonavir, but the committee determined that the benefit of asrease in combination with Ritonavir in patients who previously had not taken protease inhibitors was not proven.</seg>
<seg id="1924">Agenerase was originally licensed under "exceptional circumstances," since only limited information was available for scientific reasons.</seg>
<seg id="1925">In October 2000, the European Commission granted Glaxo Group Limited permission to transport Agenerase to the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="1926">Agenerase is shown in combination with other antiretroviral drugs for the treatment of HIV-1 infected, protease inhibitors (PI) pretreated adults and children from 4 years onwards.</seg>
<seg id="1927">Usually, Agenerase capsules are to be given to the pharmacokinetic booster by Amritavir along with low doses of Ritonavir (see sections 4.2 and 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1928">The use of amprenavir should be done taking into account the individual viral resistance pattern and the pretreatment of the patient (see Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1929">The bioavailability of Amritavir as a solution to intake is by 14% lower than from Amritavir as capsule; therefore, Agenerase capsules and solution are not interchangeable for taking on a milligram per milligram basis (see Section 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="1930">The recommended dose for Agenerase capsules is 600 mg of Amritonavir twice daily along with 100 mg of ritonavir twice daily in combination with other antiretroviral drugs.</seg>
<seg id="1931">2 If Agenerase capsules are applied without the additional addition of Ritonavir (boost), higher doses of asrease (1200 mg twice daily) must be applied.</seg>
<seg id="1932">The recommended dose for Agenerase capsules is 20 mg of Amritavir / kg body weight twice daily in combination with other antiretroviral drugs up to a daily maximum dosage of 2400 mg of amprenavir that should not be exceeded (see Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1933">The pharmacokinetics, efficacy and safety of Agenerase in combination with low doses of Ritonavir or other protease inhibitors were not studied in children.</seg>
<seg id="1934">Agenerase is not recommended for use in children under 4 years of age due to the lack of data on safety and efficacy (see Section 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="1935">Based on the pharmacokinetic data, the dose of Agenerase capsules in adult patients with moderate liver dysfunction should be reduced to 450 mg twice daily and in patients with severe liver dysfunction to 300 mg twice daily.</seg>
<seg id="1936">The simultaneous application should be carried out with caution in patients with mild or moderate liver dysfunction. in patients with severe liver dysfunction, it is contraindicated (see Section 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="1937">Agenerase may not be given at the same time with drugs that have a low therapeutic width and also present substrates of the cytochrome P450 isoenzyms 3A4 (CYP3A4).</seg>
<seg id="1938">Plant preparations containing St. John's wort (Hypericum perforatum) may not be used for the risk of reduced plasma concentrations and a diminished therapeutic effect of amprenavir while taking amprenavir (see Section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1939">Patients should be advised that asthma or any other antiretroviral therapy does not lead to curing the HIV infection and that they continue to develop opportunistic infections or other complications of HIV infection.</seg>
<seg id="1940">Current antiretroviral therapy including treatment with Agenerase does not prevent the risk of transmitting HIV to others through sexual contact or contamination with blood.</seg>
<seg id="1941">Usually, ascapase capsules should be used along with low doses of ritonavir and in combination with other antiretroviral drugs (see section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="1942">Patients suffering from chronic hepatitis B or C and treated with antiretroviral combination therapy have an increased risk of severe liver interaction with potentially fatal course.</seg>
<seg id="1943">In case of simultaneous antiviral treatment of hepatitis B or C, please read the relevant information of this medicine.</seg>
<seg id="1944">Patients with pre-existing reduced liver function including chronic-active hepatitis show an increased incidence of liver dysfunction under an antiretroviral combination therapy and should be monitored according to clinical practice.</seg>
<seg id="1945">The simultaneous use of Agenerase and Ritonavir with fluticasone or other glucocorticoides, which are metabolised via CYP3A4, is not recommended unless the possible benefit of a treatment outweighs the risk of systemic corticosteroides including the Cushing and Suppression of the adrenal function (see Section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1946">Since the metabolism of the HMG CoA reductase inhibitor is strongly dependent on CYP3A4, an simultaneous administration of Agenerase with lovastatin and simvastatin is not recommended because of the increased risk of myopathies including Rhabdomyolysis.</seg>
<seg id="1947">4 For some medicines that can cause serious or life-threatening side effects such as carbamazepine, phenobarbital, phenytoin, tricyclic antidepressants, and warfarin (under supervision of the International Normalised Ratio), methods for determining the drug concentration are available.</seg>
<seg id="1948">In patients taking these medicines at the same time, Agenerase can be less effective because of reduced plasma levels of amprenavir (see Section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1949">Because of the possibility of metabolic interaction with the amprenavir, the efficacy of hormonal contraceptives can be altered, however, the information is not sufficient to assess the type of interactions.</seg>
<seg id="1950">If methadone is also given with amprenavir at the same time, the patients should therefore be monitored on ospiate withdrawal symptoms, especially if low doses of Ritonavir are administered.</seg>
<seg id="1951">Because of the possible risk of toxicity due to the high propylene glycol content of the Agenerase solution, this formulation is contraindicated in children under an age of four years and should be used with care in certain other patient groups.</seg>
<seg id="1952">Agenerase should be canceled in the duration of 5 if a rash is accompanied by systemic or allergic symptoms or the mucous membranes are involved (see paragraph 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="1953">In patients receiving antiretroviral therapy including protease inhibitors, the incidence of diabetes mellitus, hyperglycemia, or exacerbation of an existing diabetes mellitus has been reported.</seg>
<seg id="1954">Many of the patients had other conditions for which medication was necessary to be associated with the development of diabetes mellitus or hyperglycemia.</seg>
<seg id="1955">B. higher age, and associated with drug related factors, such as prolonged antiretroviral treatment and associated metabolic disorders.</seg>
<seg id="1956">In hemophilic patients (type A and B) treated with protease inhibitors, there are reports of an increase in bleeding, including spontaneous cutaneous hematomas and haemoarthritis.</seg>
<seg id="1957">In HIV-infected patients with severe immune defect, an inflammatory response to asymptomatic or residual opportunistic infections can develop at the time of initiation of an antiretroviral combination therapy (ART) leading to severe clinical conditions or worsening of symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="1958">Although a multifactorial aesthetic is accepted (including application of corticosteroids, alcohol consumption, severe immunosuppression, higher body mass index), cases of osteonectomy were reported in particular in patients with advanced HIV infection and / or long-term application of antiretroviral combination therapy (ART).</seg>
<seg id="1959">CYP3A4 substrates with low therapeutic width Agenerase may not be given at the same time with medicines that have a low therapeutic width and also present substrates of the cytochrome P450 isoenzyms 3A4 (CYP3A4).</seg>
<seg id="1960">CYP2D6 substrates with low therapeutic width Agenerase with Ritonavir may not be combined with drugs whose active substances are primarily metabolised via CYP2D6 and are linked to increased plasma levels with serious and / or life-threatening side effects.</seg>
<seg id="1961">It has been shown that Rifampicin causes 82% reduction in the AUC of Amritavir, which can lead to virological failure and resistance development.</seg>
<seg id="1962">In the attempt to balance the lowest plasma levels by dose increase of other protease inhibitors in combination with Ritonavir, adverse effects on the liver were often observed.</seg>
<seg id="1963">St. John's Wort (Hypericum perforatum) The serum mirrors of Amritavir can be reduced by the simultaneous use of plant preparations with St. John's wort (Hypericum perforatum).</seg>
<seg id="1964">If a patient already takes St. John's wort, the ammonia levels are and, if possible, to check the viral load and remove the St. John's wort.</seg>
<seg id="1965">Dosage adjustment for one of the medicines is not necessary if Nelfinavir is given together with Amritavir (see also Efavirenz below).</seg>
<seg id="1966">508% increased, for cmax however, reduced by 30% when Ritonavir (100 mg twice daily) was given in combination with amprenavir capsules (600 mg twice daily).</seg>
<seg id="1967">In clinical trials, doses of 600 mg of Amritavir were applied twice daily and ritonavir 100 mg twice a day demonstrating the efficacy and safety of this treatment regimen.</seg>
<seg id="1968">52% low when Amritavir (750 mg twice daily) was administered in combination with Kaletra (400 mg Lopinavir + 100 mg Ritonavir twice daily).</seg>
<seg id="1969">The Cmin values of the plasma, which were achieved twice a day in the combination of amprenavir (600 mg twice daily) with Kaletra (400 mg of Lopinavir + 100 mg of Ritonavir twice daily), are approximately 40 to 50% lower than when Amritavir (600 mg twice daily) is administered twice daily in combination with 100 mg of Ritonavir.</seg>
<seg id="1970">Dosage recommendation for the simultaneous administration of Amritavir and Kaletra cannot be given, but a close monitoring is recommended, as the efficacy and safety of this combination is not known.</seg>
<seg id="1971">No pharmacokinetic study was carried out in combination with didanosin in combination with didanosin, but due to the antasia component of Didanosin it is recommended that the proceeds of didanosin and agenerase are at least one hour apart (see Apptazida below).</seg>
<seg id="1972">Therefore, in combination with amprenavir (600 mg twice daily) and ritonavir (100 mg twice daily) no dosage adjustment is necessary.</seg>
<seg id="1973">Treatment with avirenz in combination with amprenavir and saquinavir is not recommended as exposure of both protease inhibitors would decrease.</seg>
<seg id="1974">The effects of Nevirapine to other protease inhibitors and existing limited data suggest that Nevirapine may lower the serum concentration of amprenavir.</seg>
<seg id="1975">If these drugs should be used at the same time, caution is advised as delavirins could be less effective because of the reduced or possibly subtherapeutic plasma levels.</seg>
<seg id="1976">If these drugs are used together, caution is advised; thorough clinical and virological monitoring should be carried out as an accurate prediction of the effect of the combination of amprenavir and Ritonavir is difficult on delavirdin.</seg>
<seg id="1977">The simultaneous administration of amprenavir and rifabutin resulted in a rise in plasma concentration (AUC) of rifabutin by 193%, resulting in an increase in side effects associated with rifabutin.</seg>
<seg id="1978">If it is necessary for clinical reasons to administer the rifabutin together with Agenerase, a reduction in the dosage of rifabutin is recommended to at least half of the recommended dose, although there are no clinical data available.</seg>
<seg id="1979">Pharmacokinetic studies with asthma in combination with erythromycin have not been performed, but the plasma levels of both medicines could be increased in the case of simultaneous administration.</seg>
<seg id="1980">The simultaneous application of twice daily 700 mg Fosamprenavir and 100 mg of ketoconazole once daily led to increasing the cmax of ketoconazole in plasma by 25% and the AUC (0-τ) at 2.69times compared to the value observed once daily without simultaneous use of Fosamprenavir with Ritonavir.</seg>
<seg id="1981">Other drugs that are listed below, including substrates, inhibitors or inductors of CYP3A4, may, if used together with Agenerase, may lead to interactions.</seg>
<seg id="1982">Patients should therefore be supervised by toxic reactions associated with these drugs when used in combination with asthma.</seg>
<seg id="1983">Based on the data of other protease inhibitors it is advisable that antacids are not taken at the same time as asthma because it can cause resorption problems.</seg>
<seg id="1984">The simultaneous use of anticonvulsants known as an enzyme (phenytoin, phenobarbital, carbamazepine), with amprenavir can lead to a degradation of the plasma levels of amprenavir.</seg>
<seg id="1985">Serum concentrations of calcium channel blockers such as amlodipine, diltiazem, Felodipine, Isradipine, nimodipine, nifedipine, nimodipine, Nisoldipine and Verapamil can be increased by 10 by amexploavir, thus increasing the activity and toxicity of these drugs.</seg>
<seg id="1986">The simultaneous use of Agenerase can considerably increase plasma concentrations and amplify associated side effects with PDE5 inhibitors, including hypotension, blurred vision and priapism (see paragraph 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1987">In a clinical study where Ritonavir had given 100 mg capsules twice daily along with 50 µg fluticasonpropionate intranasal (4 times daily) over 7 days of test subjects, the fluticasonpropionate plasma levels increased significantly, while the endogenous cortisol decreased by about 86% (90% confidence interval 82 to 89%).</seg>
<seg id="1988">As a result, the simultaneous administration of Agenerase with Ritonavir is not recommended along with these glucocorticoides unless the possible benefit of a treatment outweighs the risk of systemic corticosteroides (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1989">In HMG CoA reductase inhibitors such as Lovastatin and Simvastatin, whose metabolisation is highly dependent on CYP3A4, pronounced increases in plasma levels are expected while administering Agenerase.</seg>
<seg id="1990">Since plasma level increases in these HMG CoA reductase inhibitors lead to myopathy, including a Rhabdomyolysis, the combined use of these drugs with Amritavir is not recommended.</seg>
<seg id="1991">More frequent monitoring of the therapeutic concentrations is recommended up to the stabilization of the mirror, as the plasma concentrations of Cyclosporine, Rapamycin and Tacrolimus can be increased while the application of amprenavir is increased (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1992">Therefore, Agenerase may not be used together with an ally taken midazolam (see Section 4.3), while caution is required while using Agenerase with parenteral midazolam.</seg>
<seg id="1993">Data for simultaneous use of parenteral midazolam with other proteaseinhibitors point to a possible rise in plasma levels of midazolam around the 3- to 4-fold.</seg>
<seg id="1994">If methadone is administered together with an amprenavir, the patients should therefore be monitored on ospiate withdrawal symptoms, especially if low doses of Ritonavir are administered.</seg>
<seg id="1995">Because of the low reliability of historical comparisons there is currently no recommendation on how to adapt the amprenavir- dose if Amritavir is administered simultaneously with methadone.</seg>
<seg id="1996">With the simultaneous administration of warfarin or other oral anticoagulants, an increased control of INR (International Normalised Ratio) is recommended due to the possibility of attenuation or strengthening of the antithrombotic effect (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1997">The effect of an additional administration of Ritonavir on hormonal contraceptives is not predictable, so alternative methods for contraception are also recommended.</seg>
<seg id="1998">Careful monitoring of the therapeutic effects and side effects of tricyclic antidepressants (for example Desipramine and Nortryptilin) is recommended with the simultaneous administration of Agenerase (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1999">This medicine may be used during pregnancy only after careful weighing of possible benefits for the mother compared to the possible risks for the fetus.</seg>
<seg id="2000">In the milk of lactation rats, amponavir-related substances have been detected, but it is not known whether the prenatal ircleavir passes into mother's milk.</seg>
<seg id="2001">A reproducible study of pregnant rats, which was given by the disarmament in the uterus to the end of the lactation period, showed a reduced increase in 12 body weight during breastfeeding.</seg>
<seg id="2002">The further development of the seed including fertility and reproductive capacity was not affected by the administration of ampouavir to the dam.</seg>
<seg id="2003">The harmlessness of asrease was studied in adults and in children aged 4 years in controlled clinical trials in combination with various other antiretroviral drugs.</seg>
<seg id="2004">Most adverse events associated with the Agenerase treatment were mild to moderate, early on and rarely lead to treatment aboutment.</seg>
<seg id="2005">In many of these events, it is not clear whether they are related to the use of asparase or another medicine used at the same time for the treatment of HIV, or whether they are a result of the underlying disease.</seg>
<seg id="2006">Most of the side effects listed below date from two clinical trials (PROF3001, PROT3006), in which protease inhibitors received 1200 mg of asthma twice daily.</seg>
<seg id="2007">Occurrences (grade 2 to 4) evaluated by the investigators as related to the study mediation and performed in more than 1% of patients, and laboratory changes occurring during the treatment (Grade 3 to 4) are listed.</seg>
<seg id="2008">Antiretroviral combination therapy was associated with redistribution of body fat (lipodystrophy) in HIV patients, including loss of peripheral and facial subcutaneous fatty tissue, increased intraabdominal and visceral fat tissue, hypertrophy of the breasts and dorsocervical fat accumulation (Stiernacken).</seg>
<seg id="2009">Under 113 antiretrovirally not pretreated subjects treated with amprenavir in combination with lamivudine / zidovudine over a medium duration of 36 weeks, only one case was observed (&lt; 1%).</seg>
<seg id="2010">In the PROAB 3006 study, 245 NRTIs previously treated 7 cases (3%) in 241 patients (11%) in 241 patients under Indinavir, in combination with different NRTIs over an average duration of 56 weeks (p &lt; 0.001).</seg>
<seg id="2011">Skin rash was usually mild to moderate, erythematous or macular-papulous nature, with or without itching and spontaneously occured during the second week of treatment and disappeared spontaneously within two weeks without the treatment had to be aborted with amprenavir.</seg>
<seg id="2012">Cases of osteonnecrosis were reported in patients with commonly known risk factors, advanced HIV infection or long-term application of antiretroviral combination therapy (ART).</seg>
<seg id="2013">In HIV-infected patients with severe immune defect, an anti-retroviral combination therapy (ART) can develop an inflammatory response to asymptomatic or residual opportunistic infections (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2014">In PI treated patients who received 600 mg of Agenerase twice daily along with low dosed Ritonavir (Grade 3 and 4) were comparable to those who were under sole asthma-treatment comparable; one exception formed cavities of triglyceride and CPK values, which were very common in patients who received Agenerase along with low dosed Ritonavir.</seg>
<seg id="2015">In the case of an overdose, the patient is able to observe signs of intoxication (see paragraph 4.8) if necessary to initiate necessary supporting measures.</seg>
<seg id="2016">Amprenavir binds to the active centre of the HIV-1 protease and thereby prevents the processing of viral gag and gag pol- polyproteins precursors with the result of an unmature, non-infectious viral particles.</seg>
<seg id="2017">The antiviral activity of ampprenavir in vitro against HIV-1 IIIB has been studied in acute and chronic lymphoblastic cell lines (MT-4, CEM-CCRF, H9) and peripheral blood lymphocytes.</seg>
<seg id="2018">The 50% HemmRNA concentration (IC50) of amprenavir is in the range of 0.012 to 0.08 µM in acute infected cells and is 0.41 µM in the case of chronic infected cells</seg>
<seg id="2019">The relationship between the activity of the Amritavir against HIV-1 in vitro and the inhibition of HIV-1 replication in humans is not yet defined.</seg>
<seg id="2020">In the treatment of antiretroviral-not previously treated patients with the currently approved fosamprenavir / Ritonavir dosages - as with other Ritonavir blocked treatment schemas with proteaseinhibitors - the mutations described only rarely were observed.</seg>
<seg id="2021">In sixteen of 434 antiretrovirally-untreated patients who received 700mg of fosamprenavir with 100mg Ritonavir twice daily in the study ESS100732, a virological failure occurred up to week 48, with 14 isolates being genotypically examined.</seg>
<seg id="2022">A genotypic analysis of the isolates of 13 out of 14 children, in which a virological failure occurred within 59 patients treated with protease inhibitors showed resistance patterns similar to those in adults.</seg>
<seg id="2023">L10F / I / V, V11I, I13V, K20R, V32I, L33F, E34Q, M36I, M46I / L, I62V, A71V, V77I, V82A / I, I84V, I85V, L90M and I93L / M.</seg>
<seg id="2024">In the APV30003 study and its extension APV30005 (700 mg Fosamprenavir / 100 mg Ritonavir twice daily: N = 107) on patients treated with protease inhibitors over 96 weeks, the following protease inhibitors appeared:</seg>
<seg id="2025">Genotypic tests based on genotypic resistance testing can be used to estimate the activity of amprenavir / Ritonavir or Fosamprenavir / Ritonavir in patients with proteashiinhibitor-resistant isolates.</seg>
<seg id="2026">The current (July 2006) ANRS-AC-11 algorithm for Fosamprenavir / Ritonavir defines resistance as the presence of mutations V32I + 147A / V, I62V, V82A / L / F / G, I84V and L90M in combination with increased phenotypic resistance to Ritonavir and a decreased likelihood of virological response (resistance).</seg>
<seg id="2027">The conclusions regarding the relevance of certain mutations or mutation patterns may be subject to changes through additional data, and it is recommended to always consult the current interpretation systems for analysing the results of resistance tests.</seg>
<seg id="2028">Phenotypic tests based on phenotypic resistance testing can be applied in combination with genotypical data for assessing the activity of amprenavir / Ritonavir or Fosamprenavir / Ritonavir in patients with protease inhibitor resistent isolates.</seg>
<seg id="2029">Companies that sell diagnostic resistance tests have developed clinical-phenotypic Cut-offs (release points) for FPV / RTV that can be used to interpret the results of a resistance test.</seg>
<seg id="2030">Each of these four with reduced sensitivity to amprenavir associated genetic patterns creates a certain cross-resistance against Ritonavir, the sensitivity to indinavir, nelfinavir and saquinavir remains generally preserved.</seg>
<seg id="2031">There are currently data on cross-resistance between amprenavir and other protease inhibitors for all 4 Fosamprenavir resistance paths, either alone or in combination with other mutations.</seg>
<seg id="2032">Based on twenty-five antiretrovirally-not pretreated patients, in which a fosamprenavirus-containing regimen failed (one of them referred to a resistance to Lopinavir and saquinavir (three of 25 isolates), indinavir / Ritonavir (three of 24 isolates), saquinavir (three of 24 isolates) and Tidenavir / Ritonavir (four of 24 isolates).</seg>
<seg id="2033">In reverse, Amritavir maintains its activity against some other proteashiinhibitor resistent isolates; maintaining this activity appears to be dependent on the number and type of resistance mutations in the isolates.</seg>
<seg id="2034">The early departure of a failing therapy is recommended to stop the accumulation of a variety of mutations that can affect the subsequent treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2035">The evidence of the effectiveness of Agenerase in combination with Ritonavir 100 mg twice daily is based on the study PRO30017, a randomized open study, in which pre-treated adults after virological failure (100 mg twice daily) or a standard therapy (standard of care, SOC) with a PI, predominantly with low-dose ritonavir.</seg>
<seg id="2036">One hundred and threescore (n = 163) patients with proven virus sensitivity to Agenerase, at least another PI and at least one NRTI were included in the Study A of PRO30017.</seg>
<seg id="2037">The primary analysis showed the non-supremacy of APV / Ritonavir compared to the time-adjusted averages of the initial value (AAUCMB) in the viral load (HIV-1 RNA) in the plasma after 16 weeks, with a non-submission wave of 0.4 log10 copies / ml.</seg>
<seg id="2038">The evidence of the efficacy of non-linked Agenerase is based on two uncontrolled trials involving 288 HIV-infected children aged 2 to 18, of which 152 were pre-treated with PI.</seg>
<seg id="2039">In the studies, Agenerase intake and capsule dosage of 15 mg / kg was three times daily, 20 mg / kg three times daily, 20 mg / kg twice daily and 22.5 mg / kg twice daily, with the majority of patients receiving 20 mg / kg twice daily.</seg>
<seg id="2040">No low dosed Ritonavir was given at the same time; the majority of those previously treated with PI had at least one (78%) or two (42%) of NRTIs administered together with Agenerase.</seg>
<seg id="2041">After 48 weeks, approximately 25% of patients enrolled in the study had a plasma-HIV-1 RNA concentration &lt; 10,000 copies / ml and 9% &lt; 400 copies / ml for a median increase in CD4 cell count of 26 cells / mm ³ (n = 74) compared to the initial value.</seg>
<seg id="2042">19 Based on these data, it should be considered in the treatment optimisation of children treated with PI from the expected benefit of "unblocked" asthma.</seg>
<seg id="2043">After oral administration the mean duration (Tmax) up to the maximum serum concentration of Amritavir amounts approximately 1 to 2 hours for the capsule and approximately 0.5 to 1 hour for the solution.</seg>
<seg id="2044">508% increased, for cmax on the other hand reduced by 30% when Ritonavir (100 mg twice daily) was administered together with amprenavir (600 mg twice daily).</seg>
<seg id="2045">The administration of amprenavir with a meal leads to a 25% decline of the AUC, but has no effect on the concentration of amprenavir 12 hours after dosage (C12).</seg>
<seg id="2046">The minimum concentration in the steady state (Cmin, ss) was therefore unaffected by food intake, although the simultaneous absorption affects the extent and rate of resorption.</seg>
<seg id="2047">The apparent distribution volume amounts to approx. 430 l (6 l / kg at a body weight of 70 kg) and allows for a large distribution volume as well as an unimpeded penetration of the blood circulation into the tissue.</seg>
<seg id="2048">This change leads to a decrease in the total concentration of the active substance in the plasma, whereby the amount of an unbound tube, which represents the active portion, is likely to remain unchanged.</seg>
<seg id="2049">While the absolute concentration of unbound amplona remains constant, the percentage of free active component during dosing intervals varies depending on the total pharmaceutical concentration in the Steady State over the range from cmax, ss to Cmin, ss.</seg>
<seg id="2050">Therefore, pharmaceuticals that induce or inhibit CYP3A4, or a substrate of CYP3A4, must be administered with caution when given at the same time with agenerase (see sections 4.3, 4.4 and 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2051">The gift of Agenerase capsules, either 20 mg / kg twice or 15 mg / kg three times daily, leads to similar daily ammonia exposure as in adults with a dose of 1200 mg twice daily.</seg>
<seg id="2052">Prenavir is from the solution 14% less bioavailable than from the capsules; therefore, Agenerase Solution and Agenerase capsules are not exchangeable on a milligram basis.</seg>
<seg id="2053">Renal Clearance of Ritonavir is also negligible, so the impact of renal dysfunctions is likely to be low on the elimination of amprenavir and ritonavir.</seg>
<seg id="2054">These regimens result in amprenavir plasma levels comparable to those that are achieved in healthy subjects after a dose of 1200 mg of Amritavir twice daily without simultaneous administration of Ritonavir.</seg>
<seg id="2055">In long-term studies on the carcinogenicity of mice and rats, hepatocriellular adenomas occured in male animals, which corresponded to the 2.0-fold (mice) or 3,8- times (rat) of exposure to humans, after twice daily dose of 1200 mg of Amritavir.</seg>
<seg id="2056">The underlying mechanism for the emergence of hepatocycellular adenomas and carcinomas has not yet been elucidated and the relevance of these observed effects for humans is unclear.</seg>
<seg id="2057">However, from the present exposure data to humans, both from clinical studies and from the therapeutic application, there was little evidence of the adoption of a clinical relevance of these findings.</seg>
<seg id="2058">In a standard battery of In-vivo- and in-vitro-genotoxicity tests containing bacterial reverse mutation tests (Ames test), mouse-lymphom test, microkernel test on rats and chromosomal aberration tests on human peripheral lymphocytes, Amritavir was neither mutagenic nor genotoxic.</seg>
<seg id="2059">This liver toxicity can be monitored and proven in clinical daily life by measuring AST, ALT and the activity of alkaline phosphatase.</seg>
<seg id="2060">Until now, no significant liver toxicity in patients has been observed in clinical trials, neither during the administration of the bladder nor after the end of the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2061">Toxicity studies in young animals, which were treated at an age of 4 days, showed a high mortality in both the control animals and the animals treated with amprenavir.</seg>
<seg id="2062">In a systemic plasma exposition, which was significantly below (rabbits) or not significantly higher (rats) than the expected exposure to humans, however, a number of minor changes including thymus jugation and minor skeletal changes were observed, indicating delayed development.</seg>
<seg id="2063">24 If Agenerase capsules are applied without the additional addition of Ritonavir (boost), higher doses of asrease (1200 mg twice daily) must be applied.</seg>
<seg id="2064">The recommended dose for Agenerase capsules is 20 mg of Amritavir / kg body weight twice daily in combination with other antiretroviral drugs up to a daily maximum dosage of 2400 mg of amprenavir that should not be exceeded (see Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2065">The simultaneous application should be performed in patients with weak or slight liver function disorder, in patients with severe liver dysfunction they are contraindicated (see Section 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="2066">26 For some medicines that can cause serious or life-threatening side effects such as carbamazepine, phenobarbital, phenytoin, tricyclic antidepressants, and warfarin (under supervision of the International Normalised Ratio), methods are available to determine the drug concentration.</seg>
<seg id="2067">Agenerase should be canceled in the duration of 27 if a rash is accompanied by systemic or allergic symptoms or the mucous membranes are involved (see paragraph 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="2068">Increased risk of lipodystrophy was associated with individual factors such as higher age, and drug-dependent factors, such as a longer-lasting antiretroviral treatment and associated metabolic disorders.</seg>

<seg id="2071">The Cmin values of the plasma, which were achieved twice a day in the combination of amprenavir (600 mg twice daily) with Kaletra (400 mg of Lopinavir + 100 mg of Ritonavir twice daily), are approximately 40 to 50% lower than when Amritavir (600 mg twice daily) is administered twice daily in combination with 100 mg of Ritonavir.</seg>
<seg id="2072">Dosage recommendation for the simultaneous administration of Amritavir and Kaletra cannot be given, but a close monitoring is recommended, as the efficacy and safety of this combination is not known.</seg>
<seg id="2073">Treatment with avirenz in combination with amprenavir and saquinavir is not recommended as exposure of both protease inhibitors would decrease.</seg>
<seg id="2074">If these drugs are used together, caution is advised; thorough clinical and virological monitoring should be carried out as an accurate prediction of the effect of the combination of amprenavir and Ritonavir is difficult on delavirdin.</seg>
<seg id="2075">If it is necessary for clinical reasons to administer the rifabutin together with Agenerase, a reduction in the dosage of rifabutin is recommended to at least half of the recommended dose 31, although there are no clinical data available.</seg>
<seg id="2076">Serum concentrations of calcium channel blockers such as amlodipine, diltiazem, Felodipine, Isradipine, Nicardipin, nifedipine, nimodipine, Nisoldipine and Verapamil can be increased by amexploavir, thus increasing the activity and toxicity of these drugs.</seg>
<seg id="2077">In a clinical study where Ritonavir had given 100 mg capsules twice daily along with 50 µg fluticasonpropionate intranasal (4 times daily) over 7 days of test subjects, the fluticasonpropionate plasma levels increased significantly, while the endogenous cortisol decreased by about 86% (90% confidence interval 82 to 89%).</seg>
<seg id="2078">With the simultaneous administration of warfarin or other oral anticoagulants, an increased control of INR (International Normalised Ratio) is recommended due to the possibility of attenuation or strengthening of the antithrombotic effect (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2079">The simultaneous administration of Ortho-Novum 1 / 35 (0.035 mg Ethinyl estradiol plus 1.0 mg Norethindron) led to a decrease of the AUC and Cmin by Amritavir by 22% respectively.</seg>

<seg id="2207">Data from an open clinical study shows that patients with more than 8 lesions reported a lower total cure rate than patients with fewer than 8 lesions.</seg>
<seg id="2208">Due to the immune-stimulating properties Imiquimod cream should be applied with caution in patients receiving immunosuppressive treatment (see 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2209">From animal studies there are no direct or indirect harmful effects on pregnancy, embryonic / fetal development, childbirth or postnatal development (see 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2210">Even though quantifiable level of serum levels (&gt; 5ng / ml) cannot be quantified according to a unique or repeated topical application, no recommendation can be given during breastfeeding.</seg>
<seg id="2211">The most commonly shared and possibly or possibly associated side effects associated with the application of Imiquimod cream in the trials involving three times weekly treatment were local reactions in the field of the treatment of wards warts (33.7% of patients treated with Imiquimod).</seg>
<seg id="2212">Among the most commonly reported and possibly or possibly associated with the application of the Imiquimod cream related side effects include complaints at the application location with a frequency of 28.1%.</seg>
<seg id="2213">Patients treated with Imiquimod-cream treated basalioma patients from a placebo-controlled phase III clinical trial reported side effects are shown below.</seg>
<seg id="2214">The most common, as likely, or possibly with the application of the Imiquimod cream in connection with the adverse side effect, were a response to the application location (22% of the patients treated with Imiquimod).</seg>
<seg id="2215">The side effects reported by 252 in placebo-controlled phase III clinical trials with imiquimod cream treated patients with actinic keratosis are listed below.</seg>
<seg id="2216">The evaluation of clinical signs foreseen according to the test plan shows that in these placebo-controlled clinical trials with Imiquimod crème frequent local skin reactions including erythema (61%), erosion (30%), exkoriation / scroll (23%) and edema (14%) came (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2217">The evaluation of clinical signs foreseen according to the test plan shows that in these studies, five times weekly treatment with Imiquimod cream very often resulted in severe erythema (31%), severe erosions (13%), and to serious atrophy and evaporation (19%).</seg>
<seg id="2218">In clinical trials investigating the use of Imiquimod for the treatment of actinic keratosis, alopecia was detected with a frequency of 0.4% (5 / 1214) at the treatment centre or in the surrounding area.</seg>
<seg id="2219">The inadvertingly unique oral absorption of 200 mg of imiquimod, which corresponds to the content of about 16 bags, could lead to nausea, vomiting, headache, myalgia and fever.</seg>
<seg id="2220">The clinically most severe side effect, which occurred after several oral doses of &gt; 200 mg, consisted of hypotony that normalized according to oral or intravenous fluid.</seg>
<seg id="2221">In a pharmacokinetic study, increasing systemic concentrations of alpha interferons and other cytokines were detected after the topical application of Imiquimod.</seg>
<seg id="2222">3 efficacy studies in 3 pivotal Phase 3 showed that efficacy was significantly superior with regard to complete healing of appropriation in Imiquimod over 16 weeks of placebo treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2223">60% of patients who had treated with Imiquimod treated patients completely; this was the case with 20% of the 105 patients who had been treated with placebo (95% CI):</seg>
<seg id="2224">Total healing could be achieved at 23% of 157 patients treated with Imiquimod, compared to 5% of 161 male patients treated with placebo (95% CI):</seg>
<seg id="2225">The efficacy of Imiquimod in five times application per week over 6 weeks was examined in two double-blind placebo-controlled clinical trials.</seg>
<seg id="2226">The target populations were histologically confirmed individual primary superficial cell carcinomas with a minimum size of 0.5 cm2 and a maximum diameter of 2 cm.</seg>
<seg id="2227">Data from an open, uncontrolled long-term study after four years showed that approximately 79.3% [95% CI (73.7%, 84.9%)] of all treated patients were clinically cured and remained for 48 months.</seg>
<seg id="2228">The efficacy of Imiquimod in three weeks of treatment in one or two treatment periods of 4 weeks, interrupted by a four-week, treatment-free period, was examined in two double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trials.</seg>
<seg id="2229">Patients had clinically typical, visible, discrete, non-hypertrophic, non-hypertrophic lesions within a coherent 25 cm2 treatment area on the untreated scalp or face.</seg>
<seg id="2230">The results of two combined observation studies show a recurrence rate of 27% (35 / 128 patients) for patients with clinical healing after one or two treatment periods.</seg>
<seg id="2231">The approved indications External Feignices, Actinic keratosis and Superfizial basal cell carcinoma do not normally appear in paediatric patients and were therefore not examined.</seg>
<seg id="2232">Aldara cream was studied in four randomised, double-blind placebo-controlled trials involving children between 2 and 15 years with Molluscum contagiosum (Imiquimod n = 576, placebo n = 313).</seg>
<seg id="2233">The efficacy of imiquimod could not be shown in these studies in the doses investigated there (3x / week for a period of ≤ 16 weeks resp.).</seg>
<seg id="2234">A minimal systemic absorption of the 5% Imiquimod cream through the skin of 58 patients with actinic keratosis was observed during the three times weekly application for 16 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="2235">The highest drug concentrations in the serum at the end of the week 16 were observed between 9 and 12 hours and were 0.1, 0.2 and 1.6 ng / ml in the face (12.5 mg, 1 disposable bag), on the scalp (25 mg, 2 bags) and on the hands / arms (75 mg, 6 bags).</seg>
<seg id="2236">The calculated apparent half-life period was approximately 10 times higher than the two-hour half-time after subcutaneous use in an earlier study; this indicates an extended retention of the medicine in the skin.</seg>
<seg id="2237">The data on systemic exposure showed that the resorption of Imiquimod after topical application on MC-infected skin was low and comparable to that in healthy adults and adults with actinic keratosis or superficial basal cell carcinoma.</seg>
<seg id="2238">In a four-month study to dermal toxicity in rats, doses of 0.5 and 2.5 mg / kg KG resulted in significantly reduced body weight and increased milz weight; a study for the dermal application carried out for four months did not reveal similar effects with the mouse.</seg>
<seg id="2239">A two-year study on carcinogenicity in mice at maler administration on three days a week did not induce a tumor in the application.</seg>
<seg id="2240">The corresponding mechanism is not known, but since Imiquimod has only a low systemic absorption from the human skin and is not mutagen, there is a risk for humans to be regarded as very low due to systemic exposure.</seg>
<seg id="2241">The tumors appeared in the group of mice treated with the active-free cream, earlier and in greater numbers than in the control group with low UVR.</seg>

<seg id="2271">Aldurazyme is used for enzyme replacement therapy in patients with assured diagnosis of a Mucopolysaccharidosis I (MPS I; α -L-Iduronidase deficiency) in order to treat the not neurological manifestations of the disease (the symptoms that are not associated with brain or nerves).</seg>
<seg id="2272">This means that certain substances (glycosaminoglycans, gags) are not broken down and thus accumulate in most organs in the body and damage them.</seg>
<seg id="2273">The following not neurological symptoms of the MPS I can occur: enlarged liver, stiff joints, which complicate movements, decreased lung volume, heart and eye diseases.</seg>
<seg id="2274">Treatment with Aldurazyma should be monitored by a doctor who has experience in the treatment of patients with MPS I or other hereditary metabolic disorders.</seg>
<seg id="2275">The administration of Aldurazyme should be carried out in a hospital or clinic with revitalisation aids, and patients may need appropriate drugs before administration to prevent an allergic reaction.</seg>

<seg id="2277">In the study, the safety of the drug was mainly examined, but its effectiveness was also measured (by examining its effect on reducing the concentrations of GAG in the urine and in relation to the size of the liver).</seg>
<seg id="2278">In children under five years, Aldurazyme lowered the concentrations of GAG in the urine by about 60%, and half of the children treated had a normal sized liver at the end of the study.</seg>
<seg id="2279">The most common side effects of aldurazyme in patients aged more than five years (observed in more than 1 out of 10 patients) are headaches, nausea, abdominal pain, arthralgia (joint pain), back pain, pain in extremities (in hands and feet), heat feeling, fever and reactions to the fusion site.</seg>
<seg id="2280">Very common side effects in patients under five years of age are elevated blood pressure, decreased oxygen saturation (a measurement size of lung function), tachycardia (accelerated heart rate), fever and shivering.</seg>
<seg id="2281">Aldurazyme may not be used in patients who may be highly hypersensitive (allergic) to laronidase or one of the other components (anaphylactic reaction).</seg>
<seg id="2282">Each year, the European Medicines Agency (EMEA) will review all new information that may be known, and where necessary update this summary.</seg>
<seg id="2283">The producer of Aldurazyme will observe patients who receive aldurazyme with regard to the reactions to the infusion and the development of antibodies.</seg>
<seg id="2284">In June 2003, the European Commission granted approval to the company Genzyme Europe B.V. for the transport of Aldurazyme throughout the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2285">Laronidase is a recombinant form of the human α -L Iduronidase and is produced using recombinant DNA technology using CHO-mammal cell cultures (Chinese hamster Ovary, ovary of the Chinese hamster).</seg>
<seg id="2286">Aldurazyme is indicated for long-term enzyme replacement therapy in patients with assured diagnosis of Mucopolysaccharidosis I (MPS I, α -L Iduronidase deficiency) in order to treat the non-neurological manifestations of the disease (see Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2287">Treatment with Aldurazyma should be done by a doctor who has experience in the treatment of patients with MPS I or other hereditary metabolic diseases.</seg>
<seg id="2288">The initial fusion rate of 2 E / kg / h can be increased every 15 minutes in single steps to a maximum dose of 43 E / kg / h.</seg>
<seg id="2289">The safety and efficacy of Aldurazyme in adults over 65 years has not been determined, and no dosing schedule can be recommended for these patients.</seg>
<seg id="2290">The safety and efficacy of Aldurazyme in patients with kidney or liver failure was not determined, and no dosing schedule could be recommended for these patients.</seg>
<seg id="2291">Patients treated with Aldurazyme can develop infusion-related reactions that are defined as any adverse side effect that occurs during infusion or until the end of the infusion day (see paragraph 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="2292">For this reason, especially these patients should continue to be closely monitored and the infusion of Aldurazyme should only be carried out in an appropriate clinical environment where revitalisation devices for medical emergencies are immediately available.</seg>
<seg id="2293">Due to the clinical phase 3 study, it is expected that almost all patients form IgG antibodies against Laronidase, usually within 3 months from the beginning of treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2294">Patients who develop antibodies or symptoms of an infusion-conditional reaction must be treated with caution when using Aldurazyma (see sections 4.3 and 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="2295">Since there is little experience regarding the resumption of treatment after a longer break, due to the theoretically increased risk of hypersensitivity reactions following an interruption of the treatment must be dealt with cautiously.</seg>
<seg id="2296">60 minutes before the start of infusion with medication (antihistamines and / or antipyretics) to prevent the potential occurrence of infusion-related reactions.</seg>
<seg id="2297">In case of mild or medium-severe infusion-related reaction treatment with antihistamines and paracetamol / ibuprofen should be induced and / or reduction of the fusion rate to half of the infusion rate in which the reaction occurred.</seg>
<seg id="2298">In the event of a single, severe infusional reaction, the infusion must be stopped until the symptoms have been reduced, treatment with antihistamines and paracetamol / ibuprofen is to be considered.</seg>
<seg id="2299">The infusion can be resumed again with a reduction in the fusion rate to 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of the infusion rate in which the reaction occurred.</seg>
<seg id="2300">3 (antihistamines and paracetamol / ibuprofen and / or corticosteroids) as well as reduction of the fusion rate to 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of the infusion rate in which the previous reaction occurred.</seg>
<seg id="2301">Aldurazyme should not be used at the same time with chloroquine or procaine because there is a potential risk of interfering with intracellular intakes of Laronidase.</seg>
<seg id="2302">Experimental studies do not imply direct or indirect adverse effects on pregnancy, embryonic / fetal development, birth and postnatal development (see Section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2303">Since no data is available to newborns exposed to laronidase via breast milk, it is recommended not to breastfeed with Aldurazyme during treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2304">The side effects in clinical trials were mainly classified as infusion-related reactions which were observed in 53% of patients in the Phase 3 study (duration of treatment up to 4 years) and 35% of patients in the study with participants under 5 years (duration of treatment up to 1 year).</seg>
<seg id="2305">Adverse drug reactions in connection with Aldurazyme observed during the 3-3 trial and their prolongation in a total of 45 patients at the age of 5 or older in a treatment period of up to 4 years are listed in the following table according to the following frequency: very common (≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10).</seg>
<seg id="2306">In some patients with severe MPS-I-related involvement of the upper respiratory tract and lungs in the prehistory, severe reactions also occurred, including bronchospasm, respiratory failure and facial edema (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2307">Children Unwanted drug interactions with Aldurazyme, which were reported in a phase 2 study with a total of 20 patients at the age of 5, with predominantly severe course of course and a treatment duration of up to 12 months, are listed in the table.</seg>
<seg id="2308">100 E / kg intravenously once weekly (recommended dose), 200 E / kg intravenously once weekly, 200 E / kg intravenously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intravenously every 2 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="2309">In most patients, a seroconic version occurred within 3 months after the beginning of the treatment, with a heavier follow-up form in patients aged 5 years (average after 26 days compared to 45 days in patients aged 5 and older).</seg>
<seg id="2310">Until the end of the phase 3 trial (or up to a premature departure from the study), there were no antibodies available in 13 / 45 patients by radioimmunoprecipitation (RIP) assay, among them 3 patients, with whom it had never been too Seroconvolous.</seg>
<seg id="2311">Patients with missing to low antibody levels showed a robust reduction in the level of GAG in the urine while a variable reduction of GAG in urine was observed in patients with high antibody titers.</seg>
<seg id="2312">Four patients (three in phase 3 study and one in phase 2 study) showed a marginal to low neutralizing inhibitory effect on enzymatic laronidase activity in vitro, which did not seem to impair clinical efficacy and / or reduction of GAG in urine.</seg>
<seg id="2313">The presence of antibodies did not seem to be related to the incidence of adverse drug reactions although the incidence of adverse drug reactions typically coincided with the formation of IgG antibodies.</seg>
<seg id="2314">The reason for the enzyme replacement therapy is one of the hydrolysis of accumulated substrats and the prevention of further accumulation of sufficient enzyme activity.</seg>
<seg id="2315">After intravenous infusion, the laronidase is rapidly removed from the circulation and taken into the lysosomes, most likely via mannose-6-phosphate receptors.</seg>
<seg id="2316">The safety and efficacy of Aldurazzyme were studied in a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 3 study at 45 patients aged 6 to 43 years.</seg>
<seg id="2317">Although patients were recruited for the study covering the entire spectrum of the disease, the majority of patients were from the middle phenotype and only one patient showed the severe phenotype.</seg>
<seg id="2318">Patients were recruited if they had a forced expiratory volume (FEV) of less than 80% of the expected value, and they had to be able to stand 6 minutes and walk 5 meters.</seg>
<seg id="2319">The primary endpoints for the efficacy were the percentage change of the expected FEV and the absolute footpath in the 6-minute walk test.</seg>
<seg id="2320">All patients were subsequently recruited for an open label extension study where they received 100 E / kg aldurazyme for another 3.5 years (182 weeks) each week.</seg>
<seg id="2321">After 26 weeks of therapy the patients treated with Aldurazyme showed an improvement in lung function and the ability to stay, which is shown in the following table.</seg>
<seg id="2322">The open extension study showed an improvement and / or maintenance of these effects of up to 208 weeks in the Aldurazyme / Aldurazyme group and from 182 weeks in the placebo / Aldurazyme group, as highlighted in the following table.</seg>
<seg id="2323">The decrease in the percentage of FEV to be expected is not clinically significant over this period and the absolute pulmonary volumes increased disproportionately to the height of growing children.</seg>
<seg id="2324">Of the 26 patients with a Hepatomegaly before treatment 22 (85%) reached normal liver size until the end of the study.</seg>
<seg id="2325">Within the first 4 weeks, a significant decrease of the GAG level in the urine (µg / mg keratinine) was observed, which remained constant until the end of the study.</seg>
<seg id="2326">With regard to the heterogeneous disease manifestation between the patients taking into account the clinically significant changes overall for five efficacy-variable (expected percentage of normal FEV, distance in the 6-minute walk, motion range of the shoulder joint AHI and visual acuity), there was generally an improvement in 10 patients (22%) and a deterioration in 9 patients (20%).</seg>
<seg id="2327">A one-year open phase 2 study was carried out in which the safety and pharmacokinetics of Aldurazyme were examined in 20 patients at the time of their inclusion in the study under 5 years of age (16 patients with severe deformation and 4 with the mean follow-up form).</seg>
<seg id="2328">In four patients the dosage was increased to 200 E / kg because of increased Gag- mirrors in the urine in week 22 in the last 26 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="2329">In several patients a size growth (n = 7) and weight gain (n = 3) were determined according to the Z-Score for this age group The younger patients with the severe follow-up form showed normal mental development speed, whereas in the older patients with severe deformation, only limited or no advances in cognitive development were to be detected.</seg>
<seg id="2330">In a phase 4 study, studies on the pharmacodynamic effects of various aldurazyme dosages were carried out on the GAG mirror in the urine, liver volume and 6-minute walking test.</seg>
<seg id="2331">100 E / kg intravenously once weekly (recommended dose), 200 E / kg intravenously once weekly, 200 E / kg intravenously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intravenously every 2 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="2332">The dosage regimen with 200 E / kg intravenously every 2 weeks can represent a justifiable alternative in patients who have difficulties with weekly infusion. however, it is not proven that the long-term clinical effectiveness of these two dosing regimens is equivalent.</seg>
<seg id="2333">The European Medicines Agency (EMEA) will evaluate any new information available annually, and if necessary, the summary of the characteristics of the medicine will be updated.</seg>
<seg id="2334">The pharmacokinetic profile in patients aged under 5 years was similar to those affected by older and less severely affected patients.</seg>

<seg id="2357">If Alimta is administered together with cisplatin, a "anti-drug" (medicine against vomiting) and liquids (in order to prevent liquid deficiency) should be given before or after the application of cisplatin.</seg>
<seg id="2358">In patients whose blood pattern changes or if certain other side effects occur, the treatment should be postponed, removed or the dose should be reduced.</seg>
<seg id="2359">The active form of Pemetrexed thus slows down the formation of DNA and RNA and prevents the cells from sharing.</seg>
<seg id="2360">The transformation of Pemetrexed into its active form occurs more easily in cancer cells than in healthy cells, leading to higher concentrations of active form of the drug and a longer active duration in cancer cells.</seg>
<seg id="2361">For the treatment of the malignant pleural tube, Alimta was examined in a major study of 456 patients who had previously received no chemotherapy against their disease.</seg>
<seg id="2362">In the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer, the effects of Alimta in 571 patients with locally advanced or metastatic disease, previously treated with chemotherapy, were compared with the effects of docetaxel (another drug against cancer).</seg>
<seg id="2363">Alimta was also compared with gemcitabine (another drug against cancer), both in combination with cisplatin in a study of 1,725 patients who had previously received no chemotherapy for lung cancer.</seg>
<seg id="2364">Patients treated with Alimta and Cisplatin survived an average of 12.1 months compared with 9.3 months in the sole administration of cisplatin.</seg>
<seg id="2365">In patients who had previously received chemotherapy, the average survival time with Alimta was 8.3 months, compared with 7.9 months for docetaxel.</seg>
<seg id="2366">In both studies, however, patients in which the cancer did not attack the squamous epithelium cells were referred to as a comparison medication during the administration of Alimta.</seg>
<seg id="2367">In September 2004, the European Commission granted a permit to the company Eli Lilly Nederland B.V. to transport Alimta to the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2368">Each screw bottle must be dissolved with 4.2 mL 0,9% sodium chloride injection solution (9 mg / ml), which results in a solution of 25 mg / ml.</seg>
<seg id="2369">The corresponding volume of the necessary doses is taken from the water bottle and diluted with 0,9% sodium chloride injection solution (9 mg / ml) to 100 mL (see section 6.6).</seg>
<seg id="2370">ALIMTA is shown in combination with cisplatin for first-line treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic non-single-celled bronchial carcinoma (see Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2371">ALIMTA in monotherapy is indicated for treatment in second-line treatment of patients with Lo- Kal advanced or metastatic non-single-celled bronchial carcinoma (see Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2372">The recommended dose of ALIMTA 500 mg / m ² body surface (KOF) is administered as intravenous infusion for a period of 10 minutes on the first day of every 21 day treatment cycle.</seg>
<seg id="2373">The recommended dose of cisplatin is 75 mg / m ² of CHOF as infusion over a period of 2 hours about 30 minutes after completion of the Pemetrexed- infusion on the first day every 21 day treatment cycle.</seg>
<seg id="2374">In patients with non-small cell lung cancer after previous chemotherapy, the recommended dose of ALIMTA is 500 mg / m ². intravenous infusion lasts about 10 minutes on the first day of every 21-day treatment cycle.</seg>
<seg id="2375">In order to reduce the frequency and severity of skin reactions, a corticosteroid must be given the day before and on the day of the Pemetrexed administration and the day after the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2376">During the seven days before the first dose of Pemetrexed, at least 5 doses of folic acid must be taken and the intake needs to be continued throughout the treatment period as well as for another 21 days after the last Pemetrexed- dose.</seg>
<seg id="2377">Patients must also receive intramuscular injection of vitamin B12 (1000 mcg) a week before the first Pemetrexed dose and after each third treatment cycle.</seg>
<seg id="2378">In patients receiving Pemetrexed, a complete blood image should be created before each gift, including differentiation of leukocytes and thrombocyte counting.</seg>
<seg id="2379">Alkaline phosphatase (AP), aspartate transaminase (AST or SGOT) and alanine transaminase (ALT or SGPT) should be ≤ 3 times the upper limit value.</seg>
<seg id="2380">At the beginning of a new treatment cycle, a dose check must take place considering the presence of the Nadir blood vessel or the maximum non-haematological toxicity of the previous treatment cycles.</seg>
<seg id="2381">After the recovery, patients have to be treated according to the indications in tables 1, 2 and 3, which are used for ALIMTA as a monotherapy or in combination with cisplatin.</seg>
<seg id="2382">These criteria correspond to the definition of the National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria (CTC v2.0; NCI 1998) ≥ CTC degree 2 bleeding.</seg>
<seg id="2383">If patients do not develop haematological toxicity ≥ grade 3 (except neurotoxicity), the therapy with ALIMTA must be interrupted before the patient undertakes the value before treatment</seg>
<seg id="2384">Treatment with ALIMTA must be aborted if in patients after 2 dose reduction agents a hematological toxicity or non-hematological toxicity level 3 or 4 occurs or so- in the occurrence of grade 3 or 4 neurotoxicity.</seg>
<seg id="2385">Clinical studies have no indication that in patients aged 65 years or over, there is an increased incidental risk in patients aged 65 years.</seg>
<seg id="2386">ALIMTA is not recommended for use in children under 18 years of age due to insufficient data on safety and efficacy.</seg>
<seg id="2387">In clinical trials, no dose adjustments were necessary in patients with a keratinine clearance of ≥ 45 ml / min, exceeding the dose adjustments recommended for all patients.</seg>
<seg id="2388">The data situation in patients with a creatinin clearance of less than 45 ml / min was not sufficient; therefore the application is not recommended (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2389">However, patients with a liver function restriction of &gt; 1.5 times the upper bilirubin limit and / or transaminase values of &gt; 3.0 times the upper limit value (in the absence of liver metastases) or &gt; 5.0-fold of the upper limit value (in the presence of liver metastases) are not specifically studied in the studies.</seg>
<seg id="2390">Patients must be supervised and Pemetrexed must not be administered to patients before their absolute neutrophils regain a value of ≥ 1500 cells / mm ³ and the thrombo- cyte value has again reached a value of ≥ 100,000 cells / mm ³.</seg>
<seg id="2391">A dose reduction for further cycles is based on the Nadir of absolute neutrophils, thrombocyte and maximum non-hematological toxicity, as observed in previous cycles of treatment (see section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="2392">A lower toxicity and a reduction in grade 3 / 4 hematological and non-hematological toxicity such as neutropenia, febrile neutropenia and infection with grade 3 / 4 neutropenia was observed when a pretreatment with folic acid and vitamin B12 had taken place.</seg>
<seg id="2393">Therefore, all patients treated with Pemetrexed need to use folic acid and vitamin B12 as a prophylactic measure to reduce treatment-related toxicity (see section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="2394">Patients with mild to medium renal insufficiency (Kreatinin Clearance 45 to 79 ml / min) must avoid the simultaneous consumption of nonsteroidal antiphrology (&gt; 1.3 g daily) for at least 2 days before the therapy, the day of therapy and at least 2 days after the therapy with Pemetrexed (see Section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2395">All patients with Pemetrexed therapy have to avoid taking NSAIDs with a long half-life time for at least 5 days before the therapy, the day of the therapy and at least 2 days after the therapy with Pemetrexed (see Section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2396">Many patients in which these events occurred had corresponding risk factors for the occurrence of renal events, including dehydration, pre-existing hypertension or diabetes.</seg>
<seg id="2397">For this reason, a drainage of the effusion prior to Pemetrexed treatment should be induced in patients with clinically significant fluid retention in the transgenic space.</seg>
<seg id="2398">5 serious cardiovascular events, including myocardial infarction, and cerebrovascular events were occasionally reported in clinical studies with Pemetrexed when this substance was usually administered in combination with another cytotoxic substance.</seg>
<seg id="2399">For this reason, the simultaneous application of attenuated live attenuants (except yellow fever, this vaccination is contraindicated) is not recommended (see Section 4.3 and 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2400">Since the possibility of irreversible expansion of the reproductive ability by Pemetrexed, men should be advised of the treatment instructions to obtain advice regarding sperm conservation.</seg>
<seg id="2401">In patients with normal renal function (Kreatinin Clearance ≥ 80 ml / min), high doses of nonsteroidal antiphrology (NSAIDs, like ibuprofen &gt; 1600 mg / day) and acetylsalicylic acid can lead to reduced Pemetrexed elimination with the result of an increased occurrence of side effects.</seg>
<seg id="2402">Caution is advised if high doses of NSAIDs or Ace- tylsalicylic acid in patients with normal kidney function (creatinin Clearance ≥ 80 ml / min) are used in high doses.</seg>
<seg id="2403">Ibuprofen) or acetylsalicylic acid in high dosage for at least 2 days prior to therapy, be avoided on day of therapy and at least 2 days after therapy with Pemetrexed (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2404">Since no data regarding the interaction potential with NSAIDs with long half-time such as Piro- xicam or rofecoxib are available, the simultaneous use with Pemetrexed must be avoided for at least 5 days before the therapy, the day of the therapy and at least 2 days after the therapy with Pemetrexed.</seg>
<seg id="2405">The large intra-individual variability of coagulation status during the disease and the possibility of interactions between oral anticoagulants and antineoplastic chemotherapy require an increased monitoring frequency of INR (International Normalised Ratio) when the decision was made to treat the patient with oral anticoagulants.</seg>
<seg id="2406">There are no data for the use of Pemetrexed in pregnant women, but as with anti-inflammatory antimetabolites severe birth defects are expected during an application during pregnancy.</seg>
<seg id="2407">Pemetrexed must not be used during pregnancy unless necessary and after careful consideration of the benefits for the mother and the risk for the foetus (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2408">Since the possibility of irreversible damage to the reproductive ability by Pemetrexed, men should be advised before the commencement of treatment to obtain advice regarding the sperm production.</seg>
<seg id="2409">It is not known whether Pemetrexed passes into breast milk and unwanted effects in the breastfed baby can not be excluded.</seg>
<seg id="2410">The following table shows the frequency and severity of adverse events reported in &gt; 5% of 168 patients with mesothelioma and which were randomised to Cisplatin and Pemetrexed as well as 163 patients with mesothelioma who were randomised to cisplatin as monotherapy.</seg>

<seg id="2430">Cases of radiation pneumonitis were reported in patients who were treated before, during or after their Pemetrexed therapy (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2431">ALIMTA (Pemetrexed) is an antineoplastic antifungal that exposes its effect by interrupting the metabolic processes necessary for cell replication.</seg>
<seg id="2432">In vitro studies showed that Pemetrexed works as an antideathic with several attack points by blocking the thyme latency (TS), Dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR), and Glycamidribonucleotidfor- myltransferase (GARFT), the folate-dependent key enzymes of the de novo biosynthesis of thymidin- and Purim watches.</seg>
<seg id="2433">EMPHACIS, a multicentre, randomised, simple-blind phase 3 study by ALIMTA plus cisplatin against cisplatin with malignant pleural urothelioma showed that patients treated with ALIMTA and Cisplatin had a clinically significant benefit of survival compared to those patients who were treated only with cisplatin.</seg>

<seg id="2504">Patients who take Alli and do not have weight loss after 12 weeks should contact their doctor or pharmacist.</seg>
<seg id="2505">If these enzymes are inhibited, they cannot break down some fats in the food, causing around a quarter of the fats, which are fed into the food, unsecured the intestines.</seg>
<seg id="2506">In a third study, Alli was compared to placebo by 391 obese patients with a BMI between 25 and 28 kg / m2.</seg>
<seg id="2507">In both studies in patients with a BMI of ≥ 28 kg / m2 patients who took Alli 60 mg had an average weight loss of 4.8 kg, compared to 2.3 kg in taking placebo.</seg>
<seg id="2508">In the study with Alli in patients with BMI between 25 and 28 kg / m2, no weight loss could be observed for patients.</seg>
<seg id="2509">The most common side effects of Alli (observed in more than 1 out of 10 patients) are oily spots on after, flatus (winch) with faeces, stuhldiness, oily / oily chair, leaving oily secretion (knots), flatulence (winch) and soft chairs.</seg>
<seg id="2510">It should not be used in patients who are treated with Ciclosporin (to prevent organ rejection in transplant patients) or with medicines such as warfarin to prevent blood clots.</seg>
<seg id="2511">It may also not be used in patients suffering from long-term malabsorption syndrome (in which not enough nutrients are absorbed from the digestive tract) or from cholestase (liver disease), and in pregnant women or nursing mothers.</seg>
<seg id="2512">In July 2007, the European Commission granted Glaxo Group Limited an approval for the placing of Orlistat GSK in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2513">Alli is indicated for weight reduction in adults with overweight (Body Mass Index BMI ≥ 28 kg / m2) and should be used in conjunction with a slightly hypokaliniori, low-fat diet.</seg>
<seg id="2514">Alli should not be used by children and adolescents under 18 because there is not enough data for efficacy and safety.</seg>
<seg id="2515">Since orlistat is only minimally resorbed, it is not necessary to adjust the dosage in older patients and in patients with reduced liver and / or kidney function.</seg>
<seg id="2516">• hypersensitivity to the active ingredient or any of the other ingredients • Simultaneous treatment with Ciclosporin (see Section 4.5) • Chronic coloration syndrome • cholestase • Pregnancy (see Section 4.6) • Simultaneous treatment with warfarin or other oral anticoagulants (see sections 4.5 and 4.8)</seg>
<seg id="2517">The likelihood of occurrence of gastrointestinal symptoms (see paragraph 4.8) can increase if alli is taken together with a fat-rich single meal or fat-rich diet.</seg>
<seg id="2518">As the weight reduction in diabetes can be accompanied by improved metabolic control, patients who take a medicine against diabetes should consult a doctor or pharmacist before starting treatment with alli because the dosage of the antidiabetic needs to be adjusted.</seg>
<seg id="2519">Patients who take alli as well as medicines for high blood pressure or elevated cholesterol should consult their doctor or pharmacist if the dosage of these medicines has to be adapted.</seg>
<seg id="2520">It is recommended to take additional contraceptive measures to prevent the potential failure of oral contraception in case of severe diarrhoea (see Section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2521">In a study on drug interactions as well as in several cases with the simultaneous use of orlistat and Ciclosporin, a lowering of the Ciclosporin plasma levels was observed.</seg>
<seg id="2522">In the application of warfarin or other oral anticoagulants in combination with orlistat, the Quick-Values (internationally standardised ratio, INR) could be influenced (see section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="2523">In most patients who were treated with orlistat in clinical trials up to 4 full years, concentrations of vitamins A, D, E and K as well as beta carotenes remained in the normal range.</seg>
<seg id="2524">However, patients should be advised to take supplements of multivitamin supplements before bedtime to ensure adequate vitamin absorption (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2525">After the administration of a single-dose Amiodarone, a minor decrease in the Amiodarone plasma concentration was observed in a limited number of healthy volunteers who received orlistat at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="2526">Experimental studies showed no direct or indirect harmful effects on pregnancy, embryonic / fetal development, birth or postnatal development (see Section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2527">The side effects of orlistat are mainly gastrointestinal nature and are related to the pharmacological effect of the drug as the absorption of absorbed fat is prevented.</seg>
<seg id="2528">Gastrointestinal effects were obtained from clinical trials with orlistat 60 mg over a period of 18 months to 2 years and were generally mild and temporary.</seg>
<seg id="2529">The frequencies are defined as follows: very common (≥ 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 10), occasionally (≥ 1 / 1,000, &lt; 1 / 100), rare (≥ 1 / 10,000, &lt; 1 / 1,000) and very rare (&lt; 1 / 10,000), not known (frequency based on available data cannot be estimated).</seg>
<seg id="2530">The incidence of adverse events detected after the market launch of orlistat is unknown since these events were voluntarily reported by a population of unknown magnitude.</seg>
<seg id="2531">† It is plausible that the treatment with alli can lead to anxiety regarding possible and actual gastrointestinal side effects.</seg>
<seg id="2532">Single doses of 800 mg of orlistat and multiple doses of up to 400 mg three times a day were administered to normal and overweight subjects over a period of 15 days without significant clinical findings.</seg>
<seg id="2533">In the majority of reported cases of orlistat overdosing, either side effects or similar side effects were reported as at the recommended dose of orlistat.</seg>
<seg id="2534">Based on studies on humans and animals, a rapid recovery of any systemic effects that can be attributed to the lipasating properties of orlistat can be assumed.</seg>
<seg id="2535">The therapeutic effect is used in the lumen of the stomach and the upper small intestine by covalent bonding to the active serine-rest of the gastric and pancreatic lipases.</seg>
<seg id="2536">From clinical studies it was derived that 60 mg of orlistat, taken three times a day, blocks absorption of about 25% of the food fat.</seg>
<seg id="2537">Two double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled studies in adults with a BMI ≥ 28 kg / m2 substantiate the efficacy of 60 mg orlistat, which was taken three times daily in combination with a hypokalinial, low-fat diet.</seg>
<seg id="2538">The primary parameter, the change in body weight compared to the initial value (at the time of randomisation), was evaluated as follows: as a change in body weight in the course of study (Table 1) and as a proportion of those participating in study which have lost more than 5% or more than 10% of their initial weight (Table 2).</seg>
<seg id="2539">Although weight reduction was observed over 12 months in both trials, the greatest weight loss occurred in the first 6 months.</seg>
<seg id="2540">The average change in total cholesterol was 60 mg -2.4% (initial value 5.20 mmol / l) and placebo + 2.8% (initial value 5.26 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="2541">The average change of LDL cholesterol was 60 mg -3.5% (initial value 3.30 mmol / l) and placebo + 3.8% (initial value 3.41 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="2542">At the waist circumference, the mean change was -4.5 cm with orlistat 60 mg (initial value 103.7 cm) and with placebo -3,6 cm (initial value 103,5 cm).</seg>
<seg id="2543">Plasma concentrations of non-metabolized orlistat were not measurable 8 hours after the oral administration of 360 mg of orlistat (&lt; 5 ng / ml).</seg>
<seg id="2544">7 In general, not metabolized orlistat in plasma was only sporadic in plasma and at extremely low concentrations (&lt; 10 ng / ml or 0.02 µmol) and without any signs of cumulation.</seg>
<seg id="2545">In a study with obese patients who had given the minimal systemic resorbated dose, two main metabolites, i.e. M1 (in position 4 hydrolysed lactonring) and M3 (M1 after separation of the N-formyl leucine group), were identified, representing approximately 42% of the total plasma concentration.</seg>

<seg id="2608">Alois is used in chemotherapies which are a strong trigger for nausea and vomiting (such as cisplatin), as well as in chemotherapies, the regular trigger for nausea and vomiting (such as cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin or carboplatin).</seg>
<seg id="2609">The efficacy of Aloxi can be increased by adding a Corticosteroid (a drug that can be used as an antiemetic).</seg>
<seg id="2610">The application for patients under 18 years of age is not recommended, as there is not enough information about the effects in this age group.</seg>
<seg id="2611">This means that the active agent prevents the binding of a chemical substance in the body, 5-hydroxytryptamin (5HT, also known as serotonin), to the receptors in the intestines.</seg>
<seg id="2612">In three main studies Alois examined 1 842 adults who received chemotherapies, which are strong or moderate for nausea and vomiting.</seg>
<seg id="2613">Chemotherapies, which are a strong trigger for nausea and vomiting, showed 59% of patients treated with alalabi in the 24 hours after chemotherapy not vomiting (132 of 223), compared to 57% of patients treated with Ondansetron (126 of 221).</seg>
<seg id="2614">Chemotherapy regimens, which are moderate for nausea and vomiting, showed 81% of patients treated with alalabi in 24 hours after chemotherapy (153 of 189), compared to 69% of patients treated with Ondansetron (127 out of 185).</seg>
<seg id="2615">In a comparison with Dolasetron these values were 63% for Aloxi (119 of 189 patients) and 53% for Dolasetron (101 out of 191 patients).</seg>
<seg id="2616">In March 2005, the European Commission granted a permit to the company of Helsinki Birex Pharmaceuticals Ltd., for the marketing of Aloxi in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2617">Alois indicated: to prevent acute nausea and vomiting in case of strong emetogenic chemotherapy as a result of cancers and to prevent nausea and vomiting in moderately emetogenic chemotherapy as a result of cancer.</seg>
<seg id="2618">The efficacy of Aloxi for the prevention of nausea and vomiting induced by a strongly emetogenic chemotherapy can be increased by adding a Corticosteroids given prior to chemotherapy.</seg>
<seg id="2619">Since Palonosetron can prolong the colon massage, patients with anamnesty obstipation or signs of subacute Ileus should be closely monitored after injection.</seg>
<seg id="2620">As with other 5HT3 antagonists, however, caution is advised with simultaneous administration of Palonosetron with medicines which extend the QT interval or tend to patients with which the Qt interval is extended or which tend to be such an extension.</seg>
<seg id="2621">In addition to a further chemotherapy regimen, alalum should not be used to prevent or treat nausea and vomiting in the days following chemotherapy.</seg>
<seg id="2622">In preclinical studies, Palonosetron inhibited the activity of the five chemotherapeutics studied against tumours (cisplatin, cyclophosphamide, cycloabine, doxorubicin and Mitomycin C).</seg>
<seg id="2623">In a clinical study there was no significant pharmacokinetic interaction between a single intravenous dose of Palonosetron and a steady state- concentration of oral metoclopramids, a CYP2D6 inhibitor.</seg>
<seg id="2624">In a pharmacokinetic analysis based on a population was shown that the simultaneous administration of CYP2D6-Inhibitors (Amiodarone, Celecoxib, Chlorpromazin, Cimetidine, Doxorubicin, Fluoxetine, Haloperidol, Ritonavir, Sertraline and Terbinafin) had no significant effect on the Clearance of Palonosetron.</seg>
<seg id="2625">Experiences concerning the use of palonosetron in human pregnancies are not present, so Palonosetron should not be used in pregnant women unless it is deemed necessary by the treating physician.</seg>
<seg id="2626">In clinical studies, the most common adverse events were observed in a dose of 250 micrograms (a total of 633 patients), which at least were related to aloha, headaches (9%) and obstipation (5%).</seg>
<seg id="2627">Very rare cases (&lt; 1 / 10,000) of hypersensitivity reactions and reactions at the location (burning, hardening, discomfort and pain) were reported in post marketing reports.</seg>
<seg id="2628">In the group with the highest dosage there were similar frequencies of adverse events as in the other dosage groups; there were no dose-effect relationships observed.</seg>
<seg id="2629">No dialysis studies were performed, but due to the large volume of distribution, dialysis is presumably no effective therapy for alopaloplasty.</seg>
<seg id="2630">Two randomised double-blind studies received a total of 1,132 patients who received a moderately emetogenic chemotherapy with ≤ 50 mg / m2 Cisplatin, carboplatin, ≤ 1,500 mg / m2 doxorubicin and 250 mcg of palonosetron, given on Day 1 without dexamethasone intravenously.</seg>
<seg id="2631">In a randomised double-blind study, a total of 667 patients who received a highly emetogenic chemotherapy with ≥ 60 mg / m2Cisplatin, &gt; 1,500 mg / m2 cyclophosphamide, and 250 or 750 micrograms Palonosetron were compared with patients who received 32 mg Ondansetron which were given intravenously on Day 1.</seg>
<seg id="2632">Results from studies with moderately emetogenic chemotherapy and a study of strongly emetogenic chemotherapy are summarised in the following tables.</seg>
<seg id="2633">In clinical trials for indication of chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV), the effects of palonosetron were comparable to blood pressure, heart rate and ECG parameters including the Qtc interval with the corresponding effects of ondansetron and cone.</seg>
<seg id="2634">After the findings of pre-clinical investigations, Palonosetron has the ability to block the ion channels involved in ventricular de- and repolarisation and prolong the duration of the action potential.</seg>
<seg id="2635">The aim of the study carried out in 221 healthy volunteers was the assessment of the ECG effects of i.v. administered Palonosetron in single doses of 0.25, 0,75 and 2.25 mg.</seg>
<seg id="2636">Absorption After intravenous administration follows an initial decrease in plasma concentrations a slow elimination of the body with an average terminal half-life of about 40 hours.</seg>
<seg id="2637">The average maximum plasma concentration (cmax) and the area below the concentration time curve (AUC0- ∞) are generally proportional in the entire dose range of 0.3- 90 μ g / kg in healthy and cancer patients.</seg>
<seg id="2638">After intravenous administration of palonosetron 0.25 mg every second day for a total of 3 doses, the mean mean (± SD) increase of the Palonosetron plasma concentration between day 1 and day 5 was 42 ± 34%.</seg>
<seg id="2639">Pharmacokinetic simulations show that the intravenous intravenous administration of 0.25 mg Palonosetron was comparable to 3 consecutive days after intravenous intravenous administration of 0.75 mg. however, the cmax was higher after an intravenous dose of 0.75 mg.</seg>
<seg id="2640">About 40% are eliminated by the kidneys and approximately another 50% are converted into two primary metabolites, which in comparison to Palonosetron have less than 1% of the antagonistic effect on the 5HT3 receptor.</seg>
<seg id="2641">In-vitro studies on metabolism have shown that CYP2D6 and CYP1A2 are involved in the metabolism of CYP3A4 and CYP1A2 on the metabolism of Palonosetron.</seg>
<seg id="2642">Elimination After an intravenous single dose of 10 micrograms / kg [14C] -Palonosetron approximately 80% of the dose were found within 144 hours in the urine, Palonosetron as an unchanged ingredient made approx. 40% of the given dose.</seg>
<seg id="2643">After a one-time intravenous bolus injection in healthy eyes, the total body weight was 173 / 73 mL / min and the renal clearance 53 ± 29 ml / min.</seg>
<seg id="2644">In patients with severe liver dysfunction, the terminal eliminator time and the average systemic exposure to Palonosetron are increased, but a reduction in dose is not justified.</seg>
<seg id="2645">In pre-clinical studies effects were observed only after expositions which are considered sufficient above the maximum human therapeutical exposure, suggesting low relevance for clinical use.</seg>
<seg id="2646">10 From preclinical studies, evidence suggests that Palonosetron can only block ion channels in very high concentrations which are involved in ventricular de- and repolarisation and prolong the duration of action.</seg>
<seg id="2647">High doses of Palonosetron (each dose corresponded roughly twice the therapeutic exposure to humans), which were given daily for over two years resulted in increased frequency of liver tumours, endocrine neoplasms (in thyroid gland, pituitary, pancreas, adrenal marrow) and skin tumors in rats, but not in mice.</seg>
<seg id="2648">The underlying mechanisms are not fully known, but due to the high dosages used and since Alois is determined in humans for one-time use, the relevance of these results is low to the human being.</seg>

<seg id="2660">In June 2006, the Committee for Medicinal Products for Medicinal Products (CHMP) adopted a negative opinion in which the approval of the marketing authorization for the treatment of hepatitis C was recommended 6 million IE / ml injection solution.</seg>
<seg id="2661">This means that alpheon should resemble a biological medicinal product called Roferon-A with the same medicinal product that is already approved in the EU (also called "reference medicinal products").</seg>
<seg id="2662">Alpheon should be used to treat adult patients with chronic (long-lasting) hepatitis C (a liver disease caused by a viral infection).</seg>
<seg id="2663">In a microscopic examination the liver tissue damages damages, in addition, the values of the liver enzyme Alanine Aminotransferase (ALT) in the blood-standard are increased.</seg>
<seg id="2664">It is produced by a yeast in which a gene (DNA) has been injected, which stimulates the formation of the active substance.</seg>
<seg id="2665">The manufacturer of Alpheon presented data that demonstrate the comparison of Alpheon with Roferon-A (substance structure, composition and purity of the medicine, mode of action, safety and efficacy in hepatitis C).</seg>
<seg id="2666">In the study of patients with hepatitis C, the efficacy of Alpheon was compared with the efficacy of the reference drug to 455 patients.</seg>
<seg id="2667">The study measured how many patients after 12 of a total of 48 weeks of treatment and 6 months after the treatment was taken to the drug (i.e. no signs of the virus reported in the blood).</seg>
<seg id="2668">74 18 84 00 Fax (44-20) 74 18 84 16 E-mail: mail @ emea.eu.int http: / / www.emea.eu.int © EMEA 2006 Reproduction and / or distribution of this document is Authorised for non-business</seg>
<seg id="2669">In addition, concerns were expressed that the data on the stability of the drug and the drug to be marketed will not be sufficient.</seg>
<seg id="2670">The number of hepatitis C patients who responded to the treatment with Alpheon and Roferon-A was similar in the clinical trial.</seg>
<seg id="2671">After setting the treatment with Alpheon, the disease flamed up again in more patients than in the reference medicinal product; in addition, Alpheon had more side effects.</seg>
<seg id="2672">Apart from this, the test used in the study to examine the question of how far the medicine is an immune response (i.e. the body produces antibodies - specific proteins - against the drug) is not adequately validated.</seg>
<seg id="2673">It can be used for treatment of Impetigo (skin infection with crust formation) and small infected lafirings (cracks or cuts), abrasions and sewn wounds.</seg>
<seg id="2674">Altargo is not intended to treat infections which have been proven or probably caused by methiciline-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) because Alarcon may not work against this type of infection.</seg>
<seg id="2675">Altargo can be used in patients from the age of nine months, but in patients under 18 years the area to be treated may not be more than 2% of the body's surface.</seg>
<seg id="2676">If the patient does not respond to treatment after two or three days, the doctor should examine the patient again and consider alternative treatments.</seg>
<seg id="2677">It works by blocking the bacterial ribosomes (the parts of the bacterial cell in which proteins are produced) and thereby inhibits the growth of the bacteria.</seg>
<seg id="2678">The main indicator of efficacy was in all five studies the proportion of patients whose infection was abbreviated after the end of the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2679">119 (85.6%) of 139 patients under Altargo and 37 (52.1%) of 71 patients under placebo responded to the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2680">In the treatment of infected skin wounds, Altargo and Cefalexin showed similar response rates: if the results of both studies were taken together in skin wounds, about 90% of both groups responded to the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2681">In these two studies, however, it was found that Altargo is not effective enough in the treatment of abscesses (filled cavities in the body tissue) or of infections caused by MRSA.</seg>
<seg id="2682">The most common side effect with Altargo (observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients) is an irritation at the job site.</seg>
<seg id="2683">The Committee for Medicinal Products (CHMP) concluded that the benefits of Altargo in short-term treatment of the following superficial skin infections are outweighed: • Impetigo, • infected small infirmary, abrasions or sewn wounds.</seg>
<seg id="2684">In May 2007, the European Commission granted Glaxo Group Ltd. a permit for the placing of altargo on the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2685">Patients with no improvement within two to three days should be examined again and considered an alternative therapy (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2686">In the case of a sensitizing or severe local irritation by using reapamulin ointment, treatment is broken down, the ointment is meticulously wiped out and an appropriate alternative therapy of the infection will begin.</seg>
<seg id="2687">Retinosulin should not be used to treat infections in which MRSA is known as pathogen or is suspected (see Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2688">In clinical trials with secondary open wounds the efficacy of retinapamulin was insufficient in patients with infections caused by a methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA).</seg>
<seg id="2689">Alternative therapy should be considered if no improvement or deterioration occurs after 2 to 3 days of treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2690">The effect of the simultaneous use of retinosulin and other topical remedies on the same skin surface has not been examined and the simultaneous application of other topical medicines is not recommended.</seg>
<seg id="2691">A clinically relevant inhibition in vivo is not to be expected in vivo due to the low plasma concentrations which have been achieved in humans based on topical application on the skin or infected surface wounds (see Section 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="2692">3 After the same oral administration of 2 times daily 200 mg ketoconazol, the mean Retapamulin AUC (0-24) and cmax after topical application of 1% reapamulin ointment increased by 81% according to topical application of 1% reapamulin ointment.</seg>
<seg id="2693">Due to the low systemic exposure to topical application in patients, dosage adjustments are not required if topical Retapamulin is applied during systemic treatment with CYP3A4 inhibitors.</seg>
<seg id="2694">Animal studies have shown a reproductive toxicity after oral intake and are insufficient with regard to a statement on the birth and the fetal / postnatal development (see Section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2695">Retinosulin ointment should only be used during pregnancy if a topical antibacterial therapy is clearly indicated and the application of retinapamulin is preferable to the administration of a systemic antibiotic.</seg>
<seg id="2696">The decision whether breast-feeding continues / terminates or the therapy with Altargo should be continued is between the benefits of breastfeeding for the infant and the benefits of the Altargo therapy for the woman to weigh.</seg>
<seg id="2697">In clinical trials involving 2,150 patients with superficial skin infections that have applied altargo was the most commonly reported side effect irritation at the place of destination which concerned about 1% of patients.</seg>
<seg id="2698">Mode of operation Retapamulin is a semi-synthetic derivative of Pleuromutilin, a substance isolated from Clitopilus passeckerianus (formerly called Pleurotus passeckerianus).</seg>
<seg id="2699">The mechanism of action of retinapamulin rests on the selective inhibition of bacterial protein synthesis by interaction with a specific binding site of the 50S subunit of the bacterial ribosome, which differs from the binding sites of other ribosomal interacting antibacterial substances.</seg>
<seg id="2700">Data indicates that the binding site ribosomal protein L3 is involved and is located in the region of the ribosomal P-binding site and the peptide transferase centre.</seg>
<seg id="2701">By binding to this binding point, Pleuromutiline inhibits the peptide transfer, blocking partly P-binding sites and prevents the normal formation of active 50S ribosomal subunits.</seg>
<seg id="2702">If, due to the local prevalence of resistance, the application of Retapamulin at least some forms of infection appear thoughtful, consultation by experts should be sought.</seg>
<seg id="2703">There were no differences in the in-vitro activity of Retapamulin against S.AUREUS, regardless of whether the isolates were sensitive or resistant to methicillin.</seg>
<seg id="2704">In case of non-compliance with S.AUREUS, the presence of strains with additional virulence factors (such as PVL = Panton Valentine Leucocidin) should be considered.</seg>
<seg id="2705">Absorption In a study with healthy adults, 1% reapamuline ointment was applied daily with occlusion on intact and laced skin for up to 7 days.</seg>
<seg id="2706">In 516 patients (adults and children) who received 1% reapamulin ointment twice daily for 5 days for topical treatment of secondary traumatic wounds, individual plasma samples were obtained.</seg>
<seg id="2707">The sampling took place on days 3 or 4 in the adult patients each before the mediation and with the children between 0-12 hours after the last application.</seg>
<seg id="2708">However, the maximum individual systemic intake in humans based on topical application of 1% ointment to 200 cm2 peeled skin (cmax = 22 ng / ml; AUC (0-24) = 238 ng · h / ml) 660 times lower than the Retapamulin IC50 for PGP inhibitor.</seg>
<seg id="2709">Metabolism In vitro oxidative metabolism of retinecamulin in human liver microsomes was primarily mediated by CYP3A4, with the low participation of CYP2C8 and CYP2D6 (see Section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2710">In studies on oral toxicity in rats (50, 150 or 450 mg / kg), which were performed over 14 days, there were signs of adaptive liver and thyroid changes.</seg>
<seg id="2711">In-vitro examination on gene mutation and / or chromosomal effects in the mouse-lymphooma test respectively in cultures of human peripheral blood lymphocytes as well as in the rats microscopy test for in-vivo analysis of chromosomal effects.</seg>
<seg id="2712">There were neither male nor female rats signs of reduced fertility in oral dosages of 50, 150 or 450 mg / kg / day, resulting in up to 5 times higher exposure than the highest estimated exposure to humans (topical application to 200 cm2 peaked skin):</seg>
<seg id="2713">In an embryotoxicity study in rats were determined at oral dosages of ≥ 150 mg / kg / day (according to the ≥ 3 times the estimated human exposure (see above)), development toxicity (reduced body weight of the foetus and delayed Ossification) and maternal toxicity.</seg>
<seg id="2714">The holder of authorization for placing on the market must ensure that a pharmacovigilance system, as presented in the module 1.8.1 of the application for authorisation (version 6.2) is present and works before the product is marketed and as long as the marketed product is applied.</seg>
<seg id="2715">The holder agrees to carry out detailed studies and additional pharmacovigilance activities in the pharmaceutical vigilance plan, as described in version 1 of Risk Management Plan (RMP) and in the Module 1.8.2 of the authorisation application, as well as all additional updates of the RMP that are agreed with the CHMP.</seg>
<seg id="2716">As described in the CHMP "Guideline on Risk Management Systems for medicinal products for human use," the updated RMP is to be submitted simultaneously with the next Periodic Safety Update Report.</seg>
<seg id="2717">Irritation or other signs and symptoms in the treated area indicate how to stop the application of altargo and talk to your doctor.</seg>
<seg id="2718">Do not apply any other ointments, creams or lotions on the surface treated with altargo unless specifically prescribed by your doctor.</seg>
<seg id="2719">It may not be applied in the eyes, mouth or lips, nose, or female genital area.</seg>
<seg id="2720">If the ointment goes out of sight on one of these areas, wash the spot with water and ask your doctor for advice if discomfort occurs.</seg>
<seg id="2721">After applying the ointment, you can cover the affected area with a sterile dressing or a gazingband unless your doctor has advised you not to cover the area.</seg>
<seg id="2722">It is offered in an aluminum tube with a plastic closure that contains 5, 10 or 15 grams of ointment, or in an aluminium bag containing 0.5 g of ointment.</seg>
<seg id="2723">Ambiance is used to protect hepatitis A and Hepatitis B (diseases affecting the liver) in children between one and 15 years that are not immune to these two diseases.</seg>
<seg id="2724">Ambiance is being applied as part of a two-dose regimen, whereby protection against hepatitis B may only be achieved after the second dose is administered.</seg>
<seg id="2725">For this reason, Ambirix may only be used if there is a low risk of hepatitis B infection during immunization and it is ensured that the vaccination plan consisting of two doses can be brought to an end.</seg>
<seg id="2726">If a booster dose is requested against hepatitis A or B, Ambirix or another hepatitis A or B vaccine can be given.</seg>
<seg id="2727">Vaccines work by "contributing" to the immune system (the body's natural defences), as it can fight against a disease.</seg>
<seg id="2728">After a child has received the vaccine, the immune system recognizes the viruses and surface antigens as "alien" and produces antibodies against it.</seg>
<seg id="2729">Ambirix contains the same components as the Vaccine TwinStar Adult which has been approved since 1996 and has been the approved Polyrix Children's Vaccine since 1997.</seg>
<seg id="2730">The three vaccines are used to protect against the same diseases, but TwinStar adults and Twinrix children are administered as part of a three-dose vaccination plan.</seg>
<seg id="2731">Because Ambirix and TwinStar adults contain identical constituents, some of the data that support the use of Twinrix adults have also been used as evidence of the application of Ambirix.</seg>
<seg id="2732">The main indicator of efficacy was the share of vaccinated children who had developed a protective antibody concentrations one month after the last injection.</seg>
<seg id="2733">In an additional study with 208 children, the efficacy of the vaccine was compared with a six-month and a 12 month interval between the two injections.</seg>
<seg id="2734">Ambirix led between 98 and 100% of vaccinated children a month after the last injection for the development of protective antibody concentrations against hepatitis A and B.</seg>
<seg id="2735">The additional study showed that the degree of Ambirix protection was similar in a six month and a 12-month interval between injections.</seg>
<seg id="2736">The most common side effects of Ambirix (observed in more than 1 out of 10 vaccine doses) are headache, lack of appetite, pain at the injection point, redness, difference (fatigue) as well as irritability.</seg>
<seg id="2737">Ambirix may not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to the active substances, one of the other components or Neomycin (an antibiotic).</seg>
<seg id="2738">August 2002, the European Commission granted GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals a.a. to the company GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals.</seg>
<seg id="2739">The standardisation plan for primers with Ambirix is made up of two doses of vaccines, the first dose is given at the date of choice and the second dose is administered between six and twelve months after the first dose.</seg>
<seg id="2740">If a booster shot is desired for Hepatitis A as well as Hepatitis B, vaccines may be vaccinated with the corresponding monovalant vaccines or with a combination vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="2741">The anti-hepatitis B surface antigen (anti-HBsAg) and anti-hepatitis A Virus (anti-HBsAg) antibodies (anti-HBsAg) and anti-hepatitis B virus (anti-HBsAg) antibodies react in the same size as after vaccination using the respective monovalent vaccines.</seg>
<seg id="2742">It is not yet fully ensured whether immunocompetent persons who have responded to hepatitis A vaccination require a booster as protection, as they may also be protected by immunological memory even in case of no longer detectable antibodies.</seg>
<seg id="2743">3 As with all injection vaccines, the possibility of medical treatment and monitoring should always be available immediately for the rare case of anaphylactic response after the injection of the vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="2744">If a fast protection against hepatitis B is required, the standardisation scheme is recommended with the combination vaccine that contains 360 ELISA units of formalininactivated hepatitis A virus and 10 µg recombinant hepatitis B surface antigen.</seg>
<seg id="2745">In case of hemodialysis patients and persons with disorders of the immune system, there may be no adequate anti-HAV- and anti-hb antibody, so that additional doses may be needed in these cases.</seg>
<seg id="2746">Since intraoperative injection or intramuscular administration could lead to a suboptimal success, these injections should be avoided.</seg>
<seg id="2747">In thrombocytopenia or blood clotting disorders, however, ambitions may be injected subcutaneous, as in these cases it can lead to bleeding after intramuscular administration.</seg>
<seg id="2748">If Ambirix was given in the second year of life in the form of a separate injection with a combined diphtherie-, tetanus, acellular pertussis-, inactivated poliomyelitis- and Haemophilus influenza vaccine (DTPA-IPV / HIB) or with a combined measure- mumps-rubella vaccine, the immune response was sufficient to all antigens (see Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2749">In patients with immunosuppressive therapy or in patients with immune defects it must be assumed that no adequate immune response is possible.</seg>
<seg id="2750">In a clinical study conducted with 3 doses of this formulation in adults, the frequency of pain, redness, swelling, maturacy, gastroenteritis, headache and fever were comparable to the frequency observed in the earlier Thiomerian and preservative-containing vaccine formulation.</seg>
<seg id="2751">In clinical trials, 2029 inoculations were administered to a total of 1027 vaccines at the age of 1 up to and including 15 years.</seg>
<seg id="2752">In a study of 300 participants at the age of 12 up to and including 15 years, the tolerability of Ambirix was compared with the 3-dose combination vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="2753">Only exceptions were the higher frequencies of pain and difference on a calculation basis per injection dose ambiance, but not based on a calculation basis per person.</seg>
<seg id="2754">Pain was observed after the administration of Ambirix at 50.8% of the subjects compared with 39.1% in the subjects after the dose of the 3-dose combination vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="2755">After the complete inoculation cycle, 66.4% of the subjects who had given the ambient dose reported about pain, compared to 63.8% in the subjects inoculated with the 3-dose combination vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="2756">However, the frequency of difference was comparable per proband (i.e. across the whole vaccine cycle at 39.6% of the subjects receiving the Ambirix, compared with 36.2% in the subjects receiving the 3-dose combination vaccine).</seg>
<seg id="2757">The frequency of pronounced pain and difference was low and comparable to that observed after administration of the combination vaccine with the 3-doses vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="2758">In a comparative study of 1- to 11-year-old inoculations, the presence of local reactions and general reactions in the Ambirixgroup was comparable to that observed when administered with the 3-dose combination vaccine with 360 ELISA-units of formalininactivated hepatitis B virus and 10 µg recombinant hepatitis B surface antigen.</seg>
<seg id="2759">However, with the 6- to 11-year-olds a frequent occurrence of pain (at the injection point) per dose, not per proband, was reported after vaccination with Ambirix.</seg>
<seg id="2760">The share of inoculations that reported severe side effects during the 2-dose vaccination scheme with Ambirix or during the 3-doses vaccine with the combination vaccine with 360 ELISA- units of formalininactivated hepatitis B virus and 10 µg recombinant hepatitis B surface antigen was not statistically different.</seg>
<seg id="2761">In clinical trials conducted in vaccination at the age of 1 to including 15 years, the Seroconversion rates for anti-HAV were 99.1% one month after the first dose and 100% one month after the second, for the month 6 administered dose (d. h. in month 7).</seg>
<seg id="2762">The Seroconversion rates for anti-HBs were 74.2% a month after the first dose and 100% one month after the second, for the month 6 administered dose (i.e. in month 7).</seg>
<seg id="2763">7 In a comparative study carried out at 12- to and including 15-year-olds, 142 two doses of Ambirix and 147 were received with three doses.</seg>
<seg id="2764">In 289 people whose immunogenicity was invaluable, the seroprotection ratios (SP in the table below) against hepatitis B in the month 2 and 6 were significantly higher compared to the dose of the 3-dose vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="2765">The immune responses that were reached in a clinical comparative study at 1- to 11-year-olds a month after completion of the full inoculation series (i.e. in month 7) are listed in the following table.</seg>
<seg id="2766">Both studies received either a 2-dose vaccination scheme with Ambirix or a 3-dose vaccine scheme with a combination vaccine with 360 ELISA units of formalininactivated hepatitis A virus and 10µg recombinant hepatitis B surface antigen.</seg>
<seg id="2767">For persons who were between 12 and 15 years of age at the time of primortising, the persistence of anti-HAV- and Anti-HBs-antibodies could be detected over at least 24 months after immunization with Ambirix in the 0-6-month-immunisation scheme.</seg>
<seg id="2768">The immunoreaction observed in this study against both antigens was comparable to that observed after vaccination of 3 doses with a combination vaccine consisting of 360 ELISA units of formalininactivated Hepatitis- A-Virus and 10 µg recombinant hepatitis B surface antigen in a dose volume of 0.5 ml.</seg>
<seg id="2769">In a clinical study from 12 - to including 15-year-olds, it was possible to demonstrate that the persistence of anti-HAV- and anti-HBs-antibodies is comparable to the 0-6- month-vaccination pattern comparable to the 0-12-month-vaccine scheme.</seg>
<seg id="2770">If the first dose Ambirix was administered at the same time with the booster shot of a combined diphtherie-, tetanus, azellular pertussis-, inactivated poliomyelitis- and 8 Haemophilus influenza vaccine (DTPA-IPV / HIB) or with the first dose of a combined measles-mumps-rubella vaccine, the immune response was sufficient for all antigens.</seg>
<seg id="2771">A clinical study conducted with 3 doses of present formulation in adults showed similar seroprotection and seroconversion rates as for previous formulation.</seg>
<seg id="2772">The vaccine is to be examined both before and after respiration for any foreign particles and / or physical visible changes.</seg>
<seg id="2773">Pursuant to Article 114 of the Directive 2001 / 83 / EC, the revised version shall be carried out by a state laboratory or a laboratory authorized to this purpose.</seg>

<seg id="2782">• If an allergic reaction to ambient or any part of this vaccine, including Neomycin, an antibiotic, has already been shown to you / your child.</seg>
<seg id="2783">An allergic reaction can be expressed by itchy skin rashes, shortness of breath, or swelling of the face or tongue. • If an allergic reaction has occurred with you before an earlier vaccination against hepatitis A or Hepatitis B, if you / your child has a serious infection with fever.</seg>
<seg id="2784">• If you would like to have a quick protection against hepatitis B (i.e. within 6 months and before the usually prescribed dose of the second inoculation dose).</seg>
<seg id="2785">At a possible risk of infection with hepatitis B between the first and second vaccination, the doctor will advise you / your child from vaccination with Ambirix.</seg>
<seg id="2786">Instead, he / she will recommend 3 injections of a combined hepatitis A / Hepatitis B vaccine with a reduced content of effective ingredients per injection dosage (360 ELISA units of a formalininactivated hepatitis A virus and 10 micrograms of a recombinant hepatitis B surface antigen).</seg>
<seg id="2787">The second vaccination dose of this vaccine with reduced content of effective ingredients is usually administered one month after the first dose and should give you / your child a vaccination protection before the end of the vaccination series.</seg>

<seg id="2804">Ambiance is available in packs of 1 and 10 with or without needles and in packs of 50 without needles.</seg>
<seg id="2805">Based on the data that has been known for placing on the market since issuance of the first permit, CHMP demonstrated that the benefits-risk ratio for ambition remains positive.</seg>
<seg id="2806">However, as ambition has been put into circulation only in a Member State (in the Netherlands since May 2003), the safety data available for this drug is limited due to low patient exposure.</seg>
<seg id="2807">Ammonium can also be used for patients at the age of more than a month with incomplete enzyme defect or hypervelocity encephalopathy (brain damage due to high ammonia concentrations) in prehistory.</seg>
<seg id="2808">Ammonium is divided into several individual doses to the meals - swallowed, mixed under the food or administered via a Gastrostomieschlauch (through the abdominal wall into the stomach leading hose) or a nose probe (through the nose into the stomach leading hose).</seg>
<seg id="2809">It was not a comparative study because ammonium could not be compared with another treatment or with placebo (a pseudo-drug, that is, without active ingredient).</seg>
<seg id="2810">It can also lead to loss of appetite, abnormal acidity in the blood, depression, irritability, headache, fainting, fluid retention, taste problems or taste of taste, stomach pain, vomiting, nausea, constipation, skin rash, unpleasant body odor or weight gain.</seg>
<seg id="2811">The Committee for Medicinal Products (CHMP) concluded that ammonia in patients with disorders of the urea cycle effectively prevents high ammonia levels.</seg>
<seg id="2812">Ammonium was approved under "exceptional circumstances," because only limited information on this medicine was prescribed due to the rarity of the disease at the time of approval.</seg>
<seg id="2813">The application is indicated in all patients showing a complete lack of enzyme already in newborns (within the first 28 days of life).</seg>
<seg id="2814">In patients with a late-maniac form (incomplete enzymatic defect that manifests itself after the first month of life), there is an indication of the use when anamnesis contains hyperammonia encephalopathy.</seg>
<seg id="2815">For infants, for children who are unable to swallow tablets or for patients with dysphagia AMMONAPS is also available in granular form.</seg>
<seg id="2816">The daily dose is calculated individually taking into account the protein tolerance and the daily protein intake needed for the growth and the development of the patient's daily protein intake.</seg>
<seg id="2817">According to previous clinical experience, the normal daily dose sodium phenylbutyrate is: • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day in children with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9.9 - 13.0 g / m ² / day in children with a body weight over 20 kg as well as adolescents and adults.</seg>
<seg id="2818">In patients suffering from an early manifest defect of carbamyl phosphate synthetase or ornithine transcarbamylase, the substitution of citrulline or arginine is required at a dose of 0.17 g / kg / day or 3.8 g / m ² / day.</seg>
<seg id="2819">Patients with arginine osuccinate synthetase deficiency must receive arginine in a dose of 0.4 - 0.7 g / kg / day or 8.8 - 15.4 g / m ² / day.</seg>
<seg id="2820">AMMONAPS tablets may not be given to patients with dysphagia since there is a risk of esophageal ulceration when the tablets do not immediately enter the stomach.</seg>
<seg id="2821">Each tablet AMMONAPS contains 62 mg (2.7 mmol) sodium, equivalent to 2.5 g (108 mmol) sodium per 20g sodium phenylbutyrate, which corresponds to the maximum daily dose.</seg>
<seg id="2822">Therefore, AMMONAPS should only be used with caution in patients with congestive heart failure or severe renal insufficiency as well as in clinical conditions associated with sodium retention and oedema.</seg>
<seg id="2823">Since metabolism and excretion of sodium phenylbutyrate over the liver and kidneys is carried out, AMMONAPS should only be used with extreme caution in patients with liver or kidney failure.</seg>
<seg id="2824">The importance of these results regarding pregnant women is unknown; the use of AMMONAPS during pregnancy is therefore contraindicated (see 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="2825">With subcutaneous administration of phenylacetate to young rats in high doses (190 - 474 mg / kg), there was a slowdown in neuronal proliferation and increased neuron loss.</seg>
<seg id="2826">There was also a delayed maturation of cerebral synapses and a reduced number of functioning nerve damage in the brain and thus a disability of brain growth.</seg>
<seg id="2827">It could not be determined whether phenylacetate is excreted by humans into breast milk, and for this reason the use of AMMONAPS during breastfeeding is contraindicated (see 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="2828">In clinical trials with AMMONAPS, at least one undesired event (AE) occurred at 56% of the patients and 78% of these adverse events were assumed to not be associated with AMMONAPS.</seg>
<seg id="2829">The frequency is defined as follows: very common (≥ 1 / 10), often (≥ 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 10) and occasionally (≥ 1 / 1.000, &lt; 1 / 100).</seg>
<seg id="2830">A likely toxic reaction to AMMONAPS (450 mg / kg / day) was reported by an 18-year-old anorectal patient, who developed a metabolic encephalopathy in combination with lactic acid, severe hypokalemia, armytopenia, peripheral neuropathy and pancreatitis.</seg>
<seg id="2831">An overdose case occurred during a 5 month-old infant with an accidental overdose of 10g (1370 mg / kg).</seg>
<seg id="2832">These symptoms are associated with the accumulation of phenylacetate, which showed dose-limiting neurotoxicity during intravenous administration of doses of up to 400 mg / kg / day.</seg>
<seg id="2833">Phenylacetate is a metabolically active compound conjugated by acetylation with glutamine to phenylacetylglutamine, which is excreted via the kidneys.</seg>
<seg id="2834">Phenylacetylglutamine is comparable with urea (both compounds contain 2 nitric atoms); phenylacetylglutamine is therefore suitable as an alternative carrier for excretion of excess nitrogen.</seg>
<seg id="2835">5 Patients with dysfunctions of the urea cycle can be assumed that for each gram the sodium phenylbutyrate is produced between 0.12 and 0.15 g phenylacetylglutamine nitrogen.</seg>
<seg id="2836">It is important that the diagnosis is set at an early stage and the treatment will begin immediately to improve survival chances and clinical outcome.</seg>
<seg id="2837">The prediction of the premature manifest form of the disease with the appearance of the first symptoms in newborns was almost always fist, and the disease itself led to death even when treating with peritoneal dialysis and essential amino acids or with their nitrogen-free analogues within the first year of life.</seg>
<seg id="2838">By hemodialysis, the use of alternative paths of nitric excretion (sodium phenylbutyrate, sodium benzoate and sodium phenylacetate), protein-reduced rust and eventually substitution of essential amino acids, it was possible to increase the survival rate of newborn in postpartal (but within the first month of life) to 80%.</seg>
<seg id="2839">In patients whose disease was diagnosed in the course of pregnancy and which were already treated before the first occurrence of hypervelocity encephalopathy, the survival rate was 100%, but even in these patients it came with time with many to mental disabilities or other neurological deficits.</seg>
<seg id="2840">In patients with a late maniac form of the disease (including female patients with the heterozygotic form of the ornithine transcarbamylase deficiency), which recovered from hyperammonia encephalopathy and subsequently treated with sodium phenylbutyrate and a protein-reduced diet, survival rate was 98%.</seg>
<seg id="2841">Already existing neurological deficits are hardly reversible even in treatment and in some patients a further deterioration of the neurological condition can occur.</seg>
<seg id="2842">It is known that phenylbutyrate is oxidized to phenylacetate, which is enzymatically conjugated in liver and kidney with phenylacetylglutamine.</seg>
<seg id="2843">The concentrations of phenylbutyrate and its metabolites in plasma and urine were determined by dosage of a single dose of 5 g sodium phenylbutyrate for sober healthy adults and in patients with disorders of the urea cycle, haemoglobin metabolism and with liver cirrhosis of oral doses of up to 20 g / day (uncontrolled studies).</seg>
<seg id="2844">The behaviour of phenylbutyrate and metabolites was also studied in cancer patients following intravenous administration of sodium phenylbutyrate (up to 2 g / m ²) or phenylacetate.</seg>
<seg id="2845">After an oral single dose of 5 g sodium phenylbutyrate in tablet form, measurable plasma concentrations of phenylbutyrate were detected in 15 minutes after ingestion.</seg>
<seg id="2846">In the majority of patients with urea-cycle disorders or haemoglobin, phenylbutyrate (300-650 mg / kg / day up to 20 g / day) was not detectable on the next morning after nightly fasting.</seg>
<seg id="2847">In three out of six patients treated with cirrhosis of the liver treated with sodium phenylbutyrate (20 g / day orally in three individual doses), the middle phenylacetate concentrations in plasma concentrations were five times higher than after the first gifts.</seg>
<seg id="2848">Excretion This drug is excreted by the kidneys within 24 hours to approximately 80 - 100% in the form of the conjugated product phenylacetylglutamine.</seg>
<seg id="2849">According to the results of the Micronucleus test, sodium phenylbutyrate had no conclusive effects in rats treated with toxic and non-toxic cans (investigation 24 and 48 hours after oral dosing of an individual dose of 878 to 2800 mg / kg).</seg>
<seg id="2850">AMMONAPS granulate is either taken orally (infants and children unable to swallow tablets or patients with dysphagia) or a gastro-stomike or a nose probe.</seg>
<seg id="2851">According to previous clinical experience, the normal daily dose sodium phenylbutyrate is: • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day in newborns, infants and children with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9.9 - 13.0 g / m ² / day in children with a body weight over 20 kg as well as adolescents and adults.</seg>
<seg id="2852">The concentration of ammonia, arginine, essential amino acids (especially branched-chain amino acids), carnitine and serum proteins in plasma should be kept within the normal range.</seg>
<seg id="2853">In patients suffering from an early manifest defect of carbamyl phosphate synthetase or ornithine transcarbamylase, the substitution of citrulline or arginine is required at a dose of 0.17 g / kg / day or 3.8 g / m ² / day.</seg>
<seg id="2854">AMMONAPS granulate contains 124 mg (5.4 mmol) sodium per gram of sodium phenylbutyrate, equivalent to 2.5 g (108 mmol) sodium per 20 g sodium phenylbutyrate, which corresponds to the maximum daily dose.</seg>
<seg id="2855">If rat-fetters were exposed before the birth of phenylacetate (active metabolite by phenylbutyrate), lesions in the pyramids of the brain rinse occurred.</seg>
<seg id="2856">A likely toxic reaction to AMMONAPS (450 mg / kg / day) was reported by an 18-year-old anorectal patient, who developed a metabolic encephalopathy in combination with lactic acid, severe hypokalemia, armytopenia, peripheral neuropathy and pancreatitis.</seg>
<seg id="2857">Phenylacetylglutamine is comparable to urea (both compounds contain 2 nitric atoms); phenylacetylglutamine is therefore suitable as an alternative carrier for excretion of excess</seg>
<seg id="2858">Based on studies on the excretion of phenylacetylglutamine in patients with disorders of the urea cycle can be assumed that for each gram the sodium phenylbutyrate is taken between 0.12 and 0.15 g phenylacetylglutamine nitrogen.</seg>
<seg id="2859">Already existing neurological deficits are hardly reversible even in treatment, and in some patients a further deterioration of the neurological condition can occur.</seg>
<seg id="2860">After an oral single dose of 5 g sodium phenylbutyrate in granular form, measurable plasma concentrations of phenylbutyrate were detected in 15 minutes after ingestion.</seg>
<seg id="2861">During the duration of the shelf life the patient can store the finished product once for a period of 3 months at a temperature of not above 25 ° C.</seg>
<seg id="2862">In this procedure the small measuring spoon contains 0,95 g, the medium measuring spoon of 2.9 g and the large measuring spoon 8.6 g sodium phenylbutyrate.</seg>
<seg id="2863">If a patient has to receive the medicine via a probe, AMMONAPS can also be dissolved in water before use (the solubility of sodium phenylbutyrate is up to 5 g in 10 ml of water).</seg>
<seg id="2864">In patients with these rare diseases, certain liver enzymes are missing, so that they cannot excrete the nitrogen-containing waste products that accumulate in the body after eating proteins.</seg>
<seg id="2865">If you undertake laboratory tests, you must inform the doctor that you are taking AMMONAPS, since sodium phenylbutyrate may affect the results of certain laboratory tests.</seg>
<seg id="2866">If you are taking AMMONAPS with other medicines, please inform your doctor or pharmacist if you have taken other medicines or have taken it until recently, even if it is not prescription medicine.</seg>
<seg id="2867">During breastfeeding, you may not take AMMONAPS as the medicine can go over to breast milk and harm your baby.</seg>
<seg id="2868">In rare cases confusion, headaches, taste problems, leaving the ear, disorientation, memory disorders and a deterioration of existing neurological conditions have also been observed.</seg>
<seg id="2869">If you notice any of these symptoms, contact your doctor immediately or with the emergency reception of your hospital for the purpose of initiating appropriate treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2870">If you miss the intake of AMMONAPS, take the appropriate dose as soon as possible with the next meal.</seg>
<seg id="2871">Changes in blood pressure (red blood cells, white blood cells, thrombocytes), decreased appetite, depression, irritability, headache, fainting, urinary retention, nausea, constipation, unpleasant skin smell, rash, kidney function disorders, weight gain and abnormal lab results.</seg>

<seg id="2876">If you are taking AMMONAPS with other medicines, please inform your doctor or pharmacist if you have taken other medicines or have taken it until recently, even if it is not prescription medicine.</seg>
<seg id="2877">You should take AMMONAPS to the same single dose orally or via a gastric fiberth (hose that runs through the abdominal wall directly into the stomach) or a nose probe (hose leading through the nose into the stomach).</seg>
<seg id="2878">31 • Take out of the container a heaped spoonful of granulate. • Enrich a straight edge, e.g. a knife back over the edge of the measuring spoon to remove excess granulate. • Remove the recommended amount of measuring scoop granulate from the container.</seg>
<seg id="2879">Angiox is used to treat adult patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS, reduced blood supply to the heart), for example with unstable angina (a form of pain in the chest with different strength) or myocardial infarction (heart attack) without "stress" (an anomalous measurement value for electrocardiogram or ECG).</seg>
<seg id="2880">If Angiox is used to prevent blood clots in patients undergoing a PCI, a higher dose is administered and the infusion can be continued up to four hours after the procedure.</seg>
<seg id="2881">This can help patients with angina or heart attack to maintain blood flow to the heart and increase the efficacy of a PCI.</seg>
<seg id="2882">Nearly 14 000 patients participated in the main study on the treatment of ACS in which the effect of angioxin in combination with a glycoprotein-IIb / IIIa inhibitor (GPI, other medicines to prevent blood clots) was compared with conventional combination treatment with heparin (another anticoagulant) and a GPI.</seg>
<seg id="2883">During the PCI, patients often used a stent (a short tube remaining in the artery to prevent closure) and they additionally received other medicines to prevent blood clots such as Abciximab and Aspirin.</seg>
<seg id="2884">In the treatment of ACS, Angiox - with or without GPI's ability - was as effective in the prevention of new events (deaths, heart attacks or revascularization) after 30 days or a year overall as effective as conventional treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2885">In patients who underwent a PCI, Angiox was as effective with regard to all indicators as heparin, except for severe bleeding in which it was significantly more effective than heparin.</seg>
<seg id="2886">Angiox may not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to Bivalira, other milkudine or any of the other ingredients.</seg>
<seg id="2887">It may also not be used in patients who recently had bleeding, as well as in people with severe hypertension or severe kidney problems or heart infection.</seg>
<seg id="2888">The Committee for Medicinal Products (CHMP) concluded that Angiox is an acceptable replacement for heparin during ACS and PCI.</seg>
<seg id="2889">In September 2004, the European Commission granted approval to the company The Medicines Company UK Ltd for the transport of angioxin throughout the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2890">For the treatment of adult patients with acute coronary syndrome (unstable angina / non-ST-uplift infarction (IA / NSTEMI)) in case of an emergency intervention or if an early intervention is provided.</seg>
<seg id="2891">The recommended starting dose of Angiox in patients with ACS is an intravenous dosage of 0.1 mg / kg followed by an infusion of 0,25 mg / kg / h.</seg>
<seg id="2892">If a PCI is carried out in another sequence, an additional stub of 0.5 mg / kg should be given and the infusion for the duration of the intervention should be increased to 1.75 mg / kg / h.</seg>
<seg id="2893">According to the clinical requirements, the reduced infusion dose of 0.25 mg / kg / h can be taken after the PCI for 4 to 12 hours.</seg>
<seg id="2894">A dosage of 0.5 mg / kg should be administered immediately before the procedure, followed by an infusion of 1.75 mg / kg / h for the duration of the operation.</seg>
<seg id="2895">The recommended dosage of Angiox in patients with a PCI consists of an initial intravenous dosage of 0.75 mg / kg of body weight and an immediately subsequent intravenous infusion with a dose of 1.75 mg / kg of body weight / h at least for the duration of the surgery.</seg>
<seg id="2896">The safety and efficacy of Angiox's sole bolus application was not examined and is not recommended even if a short PCI operation is planned.</seg>
<seg id="2897">If this value (ACT after 5 minutes) is shortened to under 225 seconds, a second bolus setting of 0.3 mg / kg / bodyweight should take place.</seg>
<seg id="2898">In order to reduce the occurrence of lower ACT values, the reconstituent and diluted medicinal product should be carefully mixed before use and the dosage dose should be administered intravenously.</seg>
<seg id="2899">As soon as the ACT value is more than 225 seconds, further supervision is no longer required, provided that the 1.75 mg / kg of infusion dose is administered properly.</seg>
<seg id="2900">In patients with moderate kidney function restriction (GFR 30-59 ml / min), which are undergoing a PCI (whether treated with Bivalira against ACS or not), a lower infusional rate of 1.4 mg / kg / h should be used.</seg>
<seg id="2901">If the ACT value is less than 225 seconds, a second dosage dose of 0.3 mg / kg is to be administered and the ACT 5 minutes after the second Bolshevik dose should be checked again.</seg>
<seg id="2902">In patients with moderate kidney damage, which were included in the phase III- PCI trial (REPLACE-2), which were used for approval, the ACT was 5 minutes after the dosage of the Bivalira-Bolus without dosage adjustment with an average of 366 ± 89 seconds.</seg>
<seg id="2903">3 In patients with severe kidney damage (GFR &lt; 30 ml / min) and also for dialysis patients Angiox is contraindicated (see section 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="2904">Treatment with angiox can be initiated 30 minutes after the intravenous administration of unfractionated heparin or 8 hours after the subcutaneous administration of low-molecular heparin.</seg>
<seg id="2905">• Sensitive hypersensitivity to active agent or other components or against deodine • active bleeding or increased risk of bleeding due to malfunctioning of hemoglobin system and / or irreversible bacterial endocarditis. • severe kidney damage (GFR &lt; 30 ml / min) and for dialysis-based patients</seg>
<seg id="2906">Patients are carefully monitored during treatment with regard to symptoms and signs of bleeding, especially when Bivalira is given in combination with another anticoagulant (see Section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2907">Even though most hemorrhages are encountered in arterial puncture sites in case of PCI patients under Bivalira, a percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) may occur during the treatment principle throughout hemorrhages.</seg>
<seg id="2908">In patients taking Warfarin and treated with Bivalira, monitoring the INR value (International Normalised Ratio) should be taken into consideration in order to ensure that the value after the treatment with Bivalira reaches the level prior to treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2909">Based on the knowledge of the mechanism of action of anticoagulants (heparin, warfarin, thrombolytics or thrombocyte aggregates), it can be assumed that these active substances increase the risk of bleeding.</seg>
<seg id="2910">In combination with thrombocyte aggregates or anticoagulants, the clinical and biological hemostasis parameters are regularly monitored.</seg>
<seg id="2911">The animal experimental investigations are insufficiently in relation to pregnancy, embryonic / fetal development, childbirth or postnatal development (see section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2912">4612 were randomised to Bivalira alone, 4604 were randomised to Bivalira and GPIIb / IIIa Inhibitor and 4603 were randomised to either unfractionated haparin or Enoxaparin plus GPIIb / IIIa Inhibitor.</seg>
<seg id="2913">Both in the Bivalira Group and in the comparative groups treated with Heparin, it was more common in women as well as in patients over 65 years of undesirable events than in male or younger patients.</seg>
<seg id="2914">Severe bleeding was defined according to ACUITY and Timi scales for severe bleeding as in the footnotes of table 2.</seg>
<seg id="2915">Both mild and severe hemorrhages were significantly less frequent in Bivalira than in the groups with heparin plus GPIIb / IIIa inhibitor and bivalidrudin plus GPIIb / IIIa- Inhibitor (see table 2).</seg>
<seg id="2916">An ACUITY heavy bleeding was defined as one of the following events: intracranial, retroperitoneal, intraocular bleeding or bleeding in the puncture area, reduction of hemoglobin mirror ≥ 3 g / dl with known bleeding area, reoperation due to bleeding, application of blood products for transfusion.</seg>
<seg id="2917">Other, less frequently observed bleeding localizations that occurred with more than 0.1% (occasionally) were "other" puncture sites, retroperitoneal, gastrointestinal, ear, nose, or neck.</seg>
<seg id="2918">The following information about side effects is based on data from a clinical study with Bivalira in 6000 patients undergoing a PCI.</seg>
<seg id="2919">Both in the Bivalira Group and in the comparative groups treated with heparin, it was more common in women as well as in patients over 65 years of undesirable events than in male or younger patients.</seg>
<seg id="2920">Both mild and severe hemorrhages were significantly less frequent in Bivalira than in the comparative group under Heparin plus GPIIb / IIIa inhibitor.</seg>
<seg id="2921">The following side effects, which are not listed above, were reported after extensive use in practice and are grouped according to system organ classes in Table 6.</seg>
<seg id="2922">In the case of an overdose, the treatment with Bivalira is immediately terminated and the patient is closely meshed in view of signs of bleeding.</seg>
<seg id="2923">Angiox contains Bivalira, a direct and specific thrombin inhibitor, which binds to the catalytic center as well as on the anion-binding region of Thrombin regardless of whether Thrombin is bound in the liquid phase or clots.</seg>
<seg id="2924">The bonding of Bivalira to Thrombin, and therewith its effect, is reversible because Thrombin, on its part, slowly splits the bonding of Bivalira-ARG3-Pro4, which regenerates the function of the active centre of Thrombin.</seg>
<seg id="2925">In addition, a thrombocytopenia / heparin-induced thrombocytopenia / heparin-induced thrombocytopenia / heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT / HITTS) was induced in the past not to induce thrombocyte aggregation reaction.</seg>
<seg id="2926">In healthy subjects and in patients, Bivalerudin shows a dose and concentration-dependent anticoagulatory effect, which is occupied by the extension of ACT, aPTT, PT, INR and TT.</seg>
<seg id="2927">If a PCI was performed following a PCI, an additional stub of 0.5mg / kg of Bivalerudin should be given and the infusion for the duration of the surgery should be increased to 1.75mg / kg / h.</seg>

<seg id="2965">Apidra is used to treat adults, adolescents and children from 6 years with diabetes that require insulin treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2966">Apidra is injected subcutaneous (under the skin) into the abdominal wall, the upper arm or upper arm or administered as a permanent infusion with an insulin pump.</seg>
<seg id="2967">Diabetes is a disease in which the body does not produce enough insulin to regulate glucose levels (sugar) in the blood or not to effectively process insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2968">Insulin lulisine very slightly differs from human insulin, and the change means that it has a quicker effect and has a shorter duration than a short-acting human insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2969">Apidra was used in combination with a long-acting insulin in patients with type 1 diabetes, in which the body cannot produce insulin, in two studies with a total of 1,549 adults and in a study of 572 children aged between four and 17 years.</seg>
<seg id="2970">In type 2 diabetes, where the body cannot work effectively, Apidra was studied in a study of 878 adults.</seg>
<seg id="2971">The main indicator of efficacy was to change the concentration of the substance glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) in the blood that indicates how well the blood sugar is adjusted.</seg>
<seg id="2972">In the first study with adults with type 1 diabetes, a reduction of 0.14% (from 7.60% to 7.46%) was observed after six months versus a reduction of 0.14% in insulin clisions.</seg>
<seg id="2973">In adults with type 2 diabetes, the reduction of HbA1c concentration was 0.46% after six months with Apidra compared to 0,30% with human normal insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2974">Apidra may not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to insulin lulisin or any of the other ingredients, or in patients who are already suffering from hypoglycemia.</seg>
<seg id="2975">The doses of Apidra might need to be adjusted if it is administered together with a number of other medicines which can affect the blood glucose level.</seg>
<seg id="2976">In September 2004, the European Commission granted approval to the company Sanofi-Aventis Deutschland GmbH for the placing of Apidra in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2977">Apidra is used as subcutaneous injection either in the area of the abdominal wall, the thigh or delta muscle, or subcutaneous through continuous infusion into the area of the abdominal muscles.</seg>
<seg id="2978">Due to the reduced glucose availability capacity and the reduced insulin metabolism, insulin demand in patients with a reduction in liver function can be reduced.</seg>
<seg id="2979">Any change in effect, brand (manufacturer), insulin type (normal, NPH, zine delays etc.), the type of insulin (animal insulin) and / or the manufacturing method may involve a change in insulin needs.</seg>
<seg id="2980">3 An insufficient dosage or discontinuation of treatment, in particular in patients with insulin-based diabetes, may result in hyperglycemia and diabetic ketoacidosis. these conditions are potentially life-threatening.</seg>
<seg id="2981">Changing a patient to another insulin type or insulin from another manufacturer should take place under strict medical supervision and may necessitate a change in dosage.</seg>
<seg id="2982">The timing of the occurrence of hypoglycemia depends on the effect profile of the insulin used and can therefore change when changing the treatment scheme.</seg>
<seg id="2983">The substances that increase blood sugar-lowering activity and increase the propensity to hypoglycemia belong to oral antidiabetic, angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, beta-oxidase (MAO) inhibitors, pentoxifyllin, propoxyphene, salicylates, and sulfonamide antibiotics.</seg>
<seg id="2984">In addition, the effects of sympatheolytics like beta-blockers, clonidin, guanethidin and reserpine can be weakened or missing the symptoms of the adrenergic backlash regulation.</seg>
<seg id="2985">Animal experimental studies on reproductive toxicity showed no differences between insu- linglulisin and human insulin in relation to pregnancy, embryonic / fetal development, birth or postnatal development (see section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2986">It is not known whether insulin lulisine passes into the human breast milk, but in general insulin neither enters the mother's milk nor is absorbed after oral application.</seg>
<seg id="2987">Listed below are the undesired clinical trials known from clinical trials, grouped by system organ classes and arranged according to decreasing frequency of their occurrence (very common: ≥ 1 / 1,000, &lt; 1 / 100; rare: ≥ 1 / 10,000, &lt; 1 / 1,000; very rare: &lt; 1 / 10,000); not known (frequency based on the available data).</seg>
<seg id="2988">Cold welding, cool and pale skin, tiredness, nervousness or tremor, anxiety, unusual exhaustion or weakness, confusion, concentration problems, dizziness, excessive yearnings, headache, nausea and palpitations.</seg>
<seg id="2989">Lipodystrophy If the injection point is continuously changed within the injection area, a lipodystrophy can occur at the injection point.</seg>
<seg id="2990">Severe hypoglycemia with unconsciousness can be treated by an intramuscular or subcutaneous injection of glucagon (0.5 to 1 mg), given by an appropriately trained person, or by intravenous administration of glucose by a doctor.</seg>
<seg id="2991">After an injection, the patient should be supervised in a hospital to determine the cause of severe hypoglycemia and to avoid similar episodes.</seg>
<seg id="2992">Insulin reduces blood sugar levels by stimulating the peripheral glucose intake (especially skeletal musculature and fat) as well as the inhibition of glucose production in the liver.</seg>
<seg id="2993">Studies with healthy volunteers and patients with diabetes have shown that in subcutaneous GA- be of insulin lulisin the impact occurs faster and the active duration is shorter than with normal insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2994">In a study involving 18 male people aged 21 to 50 years with type-1 diabetes, insulin lulisin showed a dose of proportionate glucosescing effect in the therapeutically relevant dosage range, and at 0.3 E / kg or more a disproportionate increase in the glucosescing effect, just like humaninsulin.</seg>
<seg id="2995">Insulin lulisin has a double as fast response as normal human insulin and achieves the complete glucosescing effect approximately 2 hours earlier than human insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2996">From the data it was apparent that in an application of insulin lulisin 2 minutes before meal a comparable postprandial glycaemic control is reached like with human normal insulin that is given 30 minutes before the meal.</seg>
<seg id="2997">Was insulin lulisin 2 minutes before the meal, a better postprandial control was achieved than with human normal insulin that was given 2 minutes before the meal.</seg>
<seg id="2998">If insulin lulisin is applied in 15 minutes after the beginning of the meal, a comparable glycaemic control as in human normal insulin, which is given 2 rents before the meal (see Figure 1), is achieved.</seg>
<seg id="2999">Insulin lulisin at administration 2 minutes (GLULISIN - before) before beginning of the meal compared to human normal insulin, which was given 30 minutes (NORMAL - 30 min.) before the start of the meal (Figure 1A) as well as compared to human normal insulin, which was given 2 minutes (NORMAL - before) before a meal (Figure 1B).</seg>
<seg id="3000">Insulin lulisin at administered 15 minutes (GLULISIN - afterwards) after the beginning of the meal compared to human normal insulin, which was given 2 minutes (NORMAL - before) before the beginning of the meal (Figure 1C).</seg>
