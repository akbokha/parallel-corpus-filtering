the translation module can be found in the &amp; cont@@ ent@@ or ; -@@ menu on the Extras website . select the initial and target language of the translation from the drop @-@ down list .
if part of the text is selected , only this part will be translated into place of the entire URL .
mechanical translations are only very ru@@ di@@ mentary . in the best case , Bab@@ el@@ fish produces a rough translation and in the worst case non@@ sense . therefore , no important decisions should be made dependent on the translation without checking the translation before .
only websites on the Internet can be translated . other texts should be translated on the Bab@@ el@@ fish page itself , where you can insert translated texts directly .
package &amp; package ; contains different modules for &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; . despite its small size , they offer some additional functions and simplify the use of some functions by &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; by making them readily available .
further information on how to use &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; and the built @-@ in functions can be found in the manual at &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; .
to load these modules in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or , select Settings Exten@@ sions ... Open the card card Tools and select the desired modules .
this is a list of standard setup modules from the k@@ de ; add@@ ons . please note that maybe more modules are on your system if you have additional software installed .
you should install k@@ de@@ base package , the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; contains before you compile this package .
to use the crash module , click on &amp; Kon@@ quer@@ or ; on Extras Cr@@ ush . then you can view the page that has crashed &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; to crash , or delete the list of cr@@ ashes if available .
the Vie@@ ws filter module ( also called the Fol@@ der Fil@@ ters ) can be reached in the &amp; cont@@ ent@@ or ; menu bar under Extras Key@@ filter . with the module you can filter &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; s current working directory in different ways .
to use the DO@@ M tree view in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or , select Tools DO@@ M Tree ... and open a new window with DO@@ M of the currently displayed website . as default , the display starts with the root node of the document , for example : docum@@ ent@@ Element , all other no@@ des are sub @-@ elements of this root node .
the module &amp; FS@@ View ; for &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; provides another view for objects with the MI@@ ME type in@@ ode / directory of local files . it can be used as an alternative for the different symbol and text views to view the content of your local file system .
the special feature of &amp; FS@@ View ; consists of plot@@ ting ne@@ sted folder hierarch@@ ies with the help of a so @-@ called tree map . each object is represented by a rect@@ angle , whose area is proportional to its size . this size must have the property that the sum of the sizes of the subordin@@ ate objects of an object is smaller or equal to the size of the object .
at &amp; FS@@ View , the size is the size of a file or folder , where the size of a folder is defined as the sum of the size of the entries in it . thus , large files can easily be detected when it is located far below in the folder hierarchy . accordingly , &amp; FS@@ View ; as a graphical and interactive version of the &amp; UNIX command , you can be considered .
in &amp; FS@@ View , an entry in the sit@@ emap is a rect@@ angle representing a file or folder in your fil@@ esystem . for easier navigation use the rec@@ tan@@ gles of meaningful color and labelling settings .
the color of a rect@@ angle , which is switched over View Color Mode , can display either depth for easy detection of the ne@@ sting depth or the representation of another file property such as name , owner , group or MI@@ ME type .
a rect@@ angle can be lab@@ eled with the various properties of the respective file or folder . for each property you can specify whether it is displayed at all , only if there is enough space to display or whether the area of subordin@@ ate rec@@ tan@@ gles should be used ( whereby display errors are caused by limitations on the character of the del@@ usion ) . furthermore , you can set the relative position of the label in the rect@@ angle .
for Tre@@ em@@ aps write algorithms , the rule should be maintained that the area is proportional to the size of the entry . in the case of the Tre@@ emap in &amp; FS@@ View , this goal will not always be comp@@ lied with . frames are drawn to render the entries no longer available . note that less space is lost for the frame if the rect@@ angle is square .
how parti@@ tioning the area of an entry is done for the subordin@@ ate entries is left to the implementation . for cap@@ tions and to avoid space losses through frames , it is always beneficial to create rec@@ tan@@ gles that are as square as possible . the best methods in this regard are rows , columns , or recur@@ sive parti@@ tions .
you can specify the minimal displayed area for an entry on the View menu item in Area . instead , a diamond pattern is drawn into the area of the parent entry to indicate that this area is actually occupied by an associated entry .
originally was &amp; FS@@ View ; as a small test application and introduction to the use of the Tre@@ e@@ Map wid@@ get developed for the application K@@ C@@ ach@@ eg@@ r@@ ind .

an easy @-@ to @-@ use camera interface is provided for you to connect to your digital camera and download your photos directly in &amp; digi@@ ti@@ . more than 1,000 digital cameras are supported by the g@@ photo@@ 2 library . of course , any medium and card reader supported by your operating system will work with &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed .
&amp; digi@@ ti@@ ate ; includes fast image processing with basic image editing tools . you can use them to view , comment , evaluate and correct your photos . editing capabilities can be easily expanded using K@@ DE Image Plugins Interface ( Manual ) modules .
although &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; easy to use , it provides dozens of professional skills . it works completely in 16 @-@ bit color space and all available modules support the raw conversion using li@@ bra@@ w , DNG export and ICC colour management workflow .
improved database with considerably more metadata , such as &amp; eg ; over the camera or lens , which can be searched .
like all &amp; quot ; programs are also &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; an open source project . that means it is dependent on the support of end users . therefore , you should report problems and possibilities for improvement .
&amp; digi@@ p@@ ation ; tries to make the reporting of problems or suggestions as easy as possible for them . wherever you are in the program , the help menu contains an entry problems or wishes . if you use these short@@ cuts , your web browser opens a page in the fault reporting system . all required information is already registered here . just follow the instructions to send your report .
&amp; digi@@ ti@@ ation ; is a project supported by a community . that is , the user and developer help each other . if you are a regular user of &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; then we would encourage you to ask other users of &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; ask and hopefully soon to answer questions from other users . in this mailing list , English is spoken , you should therefore be powerful .
you can also visit digi@@ p@@ ation ; visit homepage to learn about &amp; digi@@ ti@@ ze news about released versions and other information .
the best start to get involved in &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; participation is the registration in the developer mailing list . instructions for signing in the developer mailing list of &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; .
when you start &amp; digi@@ ti@@ ze ; start the first time , you &apos;ll be asked where you want to save your images and your database . simply enter a local , remote or remote folder . simply enter the path name or click the Fol@@ der icon Fol@@ der icon to select a folder .
in the second field you have to specify a local folder on your computer . here the data collection is saved . this path remains the same for all image folders .
later , you can add as many folders as you want . &amp; digi@@ ti@@ ate ; will also be used as an al@@ disk library .
if you already have a picture collection on your hard drive , you can specify the top folder that contains images as the base folder . &amp; digi@@ ti@@ ate ; view each sub@@ folder as an album . no picture will be changed . during browsing the folder , you get a progress indicator like this :
&amp; digi@@ ti@@ ates ; dur@@ alizes recur@@ sively the library path in its enti@@ re@@ ty . you can &apos;t exclude any sub@@ folders unless it is in hidden folders . this allows you to add extra@@ cur@@ bs &amp; digi@@ p@@ ation ; do this by inser@@ ting a point in front of the sub@@ folder name .
if you take an existing folder with photos as a base folder , you will notice that the albums in My Al@@ ben@@ liste do not have photos as icons . you can change that by taking any photo from the album and put it on the folder icon . this will then be used as an album symbol . for more details see the section albums .
once you have configured the base folder , you can be in &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; set up your digital camera . after that , you should learn how to use My albums and My St@@ ables to manage your photos in the albums .
raw file support : if you are using the raw mode of your camera , you can handle digi@@ ti@@ zing . the support is based on the li@@ bra@@ w library . if you want to find out if a special camera is supported , you will find a list of supported raw @-@ cameras in the help of Roh@@ kam@@ er@@ a@@ Backup .
how to set up this and work with raw files is described in the sections Ro@@ h @-@ Dec@@ oder@@ Mode and Ro@@ h workflow .
an easy @-@ to @-@ use camera interface is provided for you to connect to your digital camera and download your photos directly in &amp; digi@@ ti@@ . more than 1,000 digital cameras are supported by the g@@ photo@@ 2 library . of course , any medium and card reader supported by your operating system will work with &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed .
modern digital cameras are characterized by the use of Compact &amp; Flash ; memory cards and USB or Fire@@ Wire ( IEEE @-@ 13@@ 94 or i @-@ Link ) for data transfer . the camera then appears as disk drive . the connection can also be realized via the Picture Transfer Protocol ( P@@ TP ) and its deriv@@ atives . older cameras may also use the serial port ( RS @-@ 232 ) .
&amp; digi@@ p@@ ation ; uses the program g@@ Photo@@ 2 for communication with digital cameras . g@@ Photo@@ 2 is a free , re@@ distribut@@ able software collection for digital cameras . g@@ Photo@@ 2 also supports the Picture Transfer Protocol , a widespread protocol developed by the International Ima@@ ging Industry Association . it allows the transmission of images from digital cameras to computers and other periph@@ er@@ als without the need for additional drivers .
many old digital cameras use the serial interface for their communication with the computer . since photos are generally large files and transm@@ issions via the serial port are slow , this connection is now dep@@ rec@@ ated . &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; supports these cameras and performs the transfer of images with g@@ Photo@@ 2 . a complete list of supported cameras can be found under this link .
lib@@ g@@ photo@@ 2 must have been created with li@@ be@@ x@@ if support so that the preview images of digi@@ C@@ am can be reliably read . if the Ex@@ if support is not present in lib@@ g@@ photo@@ 2 , you might not be able to view thumb@@ nails or the generation could be very slow .
one of the most beautiful things about &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zing is how easy it is to expand its functionality through modules :
K@@ IP@@ I modules : the K@@ DE Image Plugins Interface Project ( Hand@@ book ) is an approach to develop a modular structure for &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; , K@@ Photo@@ Album , Sho@@ wi@@ mg and G@@ wen@@ view . the goal is to provide the modules to all graphics programs . the settings for the K@@ IP@@ I modules are described in this section .
modules can be manipul@@ ated in virtually any way as a user can . their advantage is that it is much easier &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; by writing a small module to add a function when the changes in &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; even perform .
to simplify the window , you can either remove the side@@ bars with &amp; L@@ MB ; remove or change to full@@ screen mode with F@@ 11 or C@@ trl + Shift + F .
drag and drop images works everywhere : you can put an image in another part of the tree , above the horizontal dividing line or in another application window . the only restriction is that a picture cannot be placed in keywords , data list or search .
- a file type selection allows you to extract the most common media : JPEG , PNG , TIFF , Ro@@ h , Films and Audio
the text filter is only used for the fields that are currently displayed in the symbol view . thus , filtering on the file name will only work if this is displayed in the symbol view . which fields are displayed can be configured in the Settings dialog .
the View &amp; quot ; My Al@@ ben@@ li@@ ste@@ quot ; provides an organized view on your photo albums . all photos taken by &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed are stored in a single album tree . these albums can be sorted according to the folders in which they were recorded on the hard drive , after the name of their collection in the Al@@ ben@@ Properties or after the date on which the album was first created .
if you have a scanner set up , you can also scan a photo directly into an album . you can also scan album Import Pictures . you can also add a scre@@ enshot directly to an album . select album Imp@@ orting scre@@ enshot .
in order to copy or move a picture from one album to another , you can move the photo with the mouse to the target album and drop it there . in the next menu you have to select whether the image is moved by moving or copying . simply select all photos and move them to the target album .
an album contains a collection of photos and the album features allow you to input information about this collection . to access the album features , right click on the album and edit album properties in the context menu .
alb@@ um@@ - Colle@@ ctions : are a method of marking your albums so that you can be group@@ ed under a common name . selecting the collection from the tool bar or sort by collection by collection . if you want to add or delete collections from the list , you can do so in the settings for collections .
the album date : is used when you sort your albums by date with View albums By Date .
buttons elders , average , new ester : these set the date on the oldest , the latest image or that of the average of the album . to do this , try to calculate the average of images from their EX@@ IF information . if this fails , the date of last modification of each file is used in this folder .
when you first opened an album in &amp; digi@@ Hi , the first picture in the album will be a symbol for the &amp; quot ; My Al@@ ben@@ li@@ ste@@ quot ; selected . this is meant to help you remember the photos on the album . sometimes the first photo in the album is not representative and you might want to select another photo as a symbol .
to select another photo as an album icon , select the image with the right mouse button and select it in the context menu &amp; quot ; As an album preview quot ; . additionally , you can drag the photo to the album in the list to set it as a symbol .
an album can always be included only in a collection and collections can &apos;t be ne@@ sted .
&amp; digi@@ ti@@ ate ; support the input of keywords for individual photos in the section My key@@ wor@@ d@@ list on the left bottom of the main window . album collections always have a different effect . you can of course use both methods to organize your photos .
the image window will provide you with the main view of your photos . if you select an album , all the images in this album are displayed in the image window . each photo will be shown in a preview , you can customize the size of this preview with the two lou@@ pe buttons in the tool@@ bar .
if you open an album for the first time , you need to wait a little while the thumb@@ nails are generated . you can avoid this by using all thumb@@ nails in the Tools menu .
information about each image will be shown below the corresponding preview . what information they are , can be changed via settings digi@@ al@@ . select here the albums page and customize the area preview images to your wishes .
the thumb@@ nails have help windows that appear . if you leave the mouse cur@@ sor a moment over a picture . the help displays the most important features including all the keywords of a photo . the scre@@ enshot above in the Intro@@ duction to the main window shows such a help window .
photos are everything about &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; go . albums and keywords allow you to organize your pictures in a way that suits you . the image processing shows your photos and allows you to achieve a number of improvements . you can choose between viewing the images , sli@@ deshow or editing the images .
you can open the image editing with a photo by selecting either F@@ 4 Image editing ... or select the context menu of the image with the right mouse button and edit ... Select . in the edit section , you will find a tutorial on how to edit your photos . with image editing , you can view your photos and change them .
it can happen that &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; the functionality you need is not available . you can open a photo in another program by selecting the context menu with the right mouse button and selecting the program from the sub@@ menu of Open . for this , and how to customize them to your needs , if your program is not enum@@ er@@ ated , you will find information in &amp; k@@ de ; manual .
you should note that after editing through other image processing programs it may lead to problems with the metadata that is contained in the picture . some programs do not store these data with when you save the changed image . this information is lost from the EX@@ IF and IP@@ TC data , such as orientation , aper@@ ture , etc .
&amp; digi@@ ti@@ ate ; Set two options for turning . the easiest way is to click on the preview and select turning . in the sub@@ menu you can specify the degree of rotation .
to change the file name of a photo , right click on the preview and select F2 Ren@@ ame from the context menu . keep in mind that you keep the extension ( .@@ jpg , .@@ tif , &amp; etc ; ) .
if you have a photo taken from &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; er@@ ase , it will be moved to the tr@@ ash@@ ers of &amp; k@@ de ; F@@ 8 image del@@ e@@ tion or removal if you &apos;d rather want to delete it , you can use this by using Shift ; Del .
&amp; quot ; My Dat@@ um@@ bel@@ ste@@ quot ; organiz@@ es your photos by means of the data . &amp; digi@@ p@@ ation ; uses either the EX@@ IF date or , if this is not available , the date of the last change of the file .
if you select a month from the list , all photos of this month will be shown in the image view . you can select days or weeks in the date sheet below in the date view to show you only the photos of the selected days .
photos with keywords provided provide a flexible and powerful way to organize and catalog your photos . Tags are sti@@ ckers that can be assigned to individual photos or entire groups . as soon as a keyword has been assigned to a photo , the photo can be found by selecting this keyword or a search .
if a keyword is selected , all photos marked with this keyword will be shown .
keywords can be sorted in a hierarch@@ ical tree . this allows you to organize your keywords log@@ ically . you can also un@@ fold parts of the tree &amp; quot ; My key@@ wor@@ d@@ song quot ; fold so that you can easily find the keywords you are looking for .
the keywords are stored in a database for quick access and assigned keyword in the IP@@ TC data fields of the image , at least for JPEG , so you can also use your keywords in other programs . besides , the keywords are re @-@ imported as soon as &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; the images are noticed .
you can add new keywords by right @-@ clicking either on &amp; quot ; My keyword quot ; or on an existing keyword and then choose New Key@@ word . if you have cli@@ cked on an existing keyword , this keyword will become the sub@@ stit@@ ch of this keyword .
you can delete a keyword by clicking on the keyword with the right mouse button and selecting Del@@ ete . if you delete a keyword , the photo itself will not be deleted . only the keyword is removed from this photo .
you can change the position of a keyword by drag@@ ging it to the desired position in the tree and disc@@ arding it . then a menu appears that gives you the possibility to move the keyword . a keyword can be at a time only once in the tree .
you can change the properties of a keyword by right @-@ clicking and selecting keywords in the context menu . you can change the name of the keyword and the symbol in the tree &amp; quot ; My Del@@ ay quot ; .
to select another photo as an album icon , select the image with the right mouse button and select it in the context menu As an album preview . additionally , you can drag the photo to the album in the list to set it as a symbol .
to be able to use keywords , you first need to add keywords . this can happen in two ways : once you have selected the photos you want to provide with a keyword , you can drag them to the corresponding keyword in the tree &amp; quot ; My Del@@ ay quot ; alternatively you can also click with the right mouse button on the preview of the images and select from the context menu keyword .
you can use a photo with any number of keywords . the photo will be shown as soon as you choose one of the keywords you assigned to it . in this way you can use a keyword for each person on a photo , one for the place where the photo was made , one for the event in which it was made etc .
once you have completed a photo with keywords , it will appear under the thumb@@ nail of the image in the main window .
you can remove a keyword in which you can use the right mouse button to open the context menu of the photo and select from the Tags menu Rem@@ ove . the menu only shows the keywords which have been assigned to the photo .
the time beam view shows a time @-@ dependent hi@@ sto@@ gram of the number of images per time unit . a selection frame can be shifted using this hi@@ sto@@ gram . to select a time frame , you only have to click on the lower right angle of the selection frame that displays the time unit . thus , all associated images are displayed in the main window .
in the field below , you can enter a title and save your selection . it will appear in the list below .
includes all the elements of the database : names , ratings , keywords , keywords , albums , collections , date stamps and in the future more .
ne@@ on er Search box is a small lamp that will be green when the search finds hits . if you click here the filtering will be deleted and all the pictures displayed again . if Search didn &apos;t find anything , then the lamp will red .
the advanced search tool is hidden in the rider in the left side bar with the bino@@ cul@@ ars . if you open this you get a simple search box as described above . you can save this search here but as a live search which always filters that which you have entered as a search criteri@@ on .
if you are satisfied with your selection , press OK and search is done . the results are displayed in the My Search list in the main window . the text box Save search as is used to make your request a name in My Search list . if you want to change your selection after searching again , you just have to select the corresponding entry from the View list and select an option in its context menu .
when you select Edit Search the form will appear to enter the search returned with the previously entered search information . if you choose to edit as advanced search , the Advanced Search dialog appears to change your previous search . here you will find more rules for searching . for more information , see the Advanced Search Tool section .
if you want to delete an existing search from the list , select Del@@ ete from the context menu .
advanced Search provides you with an advanced search form with many search parameters that you can search for in certain fields of &amp; digi@@ .@@ s database .
the list of search rules is used to set the options for a search query in the Alb@@ ay@@ aten@@ bank . all rules are added by line , separated by operators . an option can be added to this list with search group / search group or deleted from it . any option can be associated with others about the logical operations Show All ... , A ... , No ... or At least ... .
&amp; digi@@ ti@@ ate ; characterized by a long number with a special technique , the hair algorithm . this allows to compare pictures by comparing these signatures . the less the difference between two signatures , the more they match . this technique is applied in three areas .
similar entries : this is an area in which you can drop each image to find a similar . by means of a s@@ well the result selection can be enlarged or reduced . if you push a picture from somewhere over the symbol of in@@ accurate search in the left side bar , then it will open and you can drop it there .
sk@@ etch : hand @-@ hand colored sk@@ etch : draw a quick sk@@ etch and a quick sk@@ etch ; find the matching images . also here , a threshold can be set .
this tab provides an intuitive map search tool based on the Marble Mini@@ range . you can press in or out with the mouse wheel or move it down . move it while you press the left mouse button . press C@@ trl ; left mouse button to draw a square . all images within these coordinates are filtered and displayed .
in the field below you can specify a name for your ge@@ o filter . this will then be added for later use of the list below . it works like a live ge@@ o folder .
&amp; digi@@ ti@@ ate ; provides an illumin@@ ating table in a separate window with which you can easily compare pictures . it works with all supported image file formats , including raw files .
select one or more images from any view in the main window and then use C@@ trl ; L Add to the light table from the context menu . the selection will be added to the lumin@@ aire and its window will be opened . if you are back in &amp; digi@@ dy ; main window , you can quickly open the lumin@@ aire with L Extras illuminated table .
from the preview strip you can drag the images you want to compare , in the left or right pane of the window and place there . a small arrow shows you which copy in which window area is to be seen . if you can select a preview from the tool@@ bar and carry out zoo or move operations on one of the images , then they are also executed with the other picture .
another mode is better suited to quickly exp@@ el from a picture series . if you use p@@ airing mode from the tool@@ bar , then the first two images will automatically be loaded into the compar@@ isons . use the left mouse button on any thumb@@ nail to display it on the left . this simpli@@ fies it through a number of similar images .
of course , the normal delete actions also work directly from the illumin@@ ating table , e.g. F@@ 4 file editing ....
all picture information from the right side bar of the main window is available for both thumb@@ nails in the light table . this makes it easy to link visual differences with exposure data .
in the bottom of each area you will find a built @-@ in pi@@ voting feature that you can see on the crossed arrows . to swing the visible area of the picture , you need to click and hold the &amp; L@@ MB ; in the Preview Mode , both pictures will show the same image area .
zoom in the same way as in other views . just use the zoom @-@ knob under the pictures or C@@ trl ; mouse wheel to zoom into the image and zoom out . this happens in both pictures when you are in the preview mode .
what is a digital stock management - away from the fashion word ? digital Stock Manager considers every part of the process following the image made up to the final output and permanent storage . each of the photos absor@@ bs , scans or stores digital photos carries out a form of digital stock management . most of us do this however not in a systematic and efficient way .
we give you a tool , a plan and practical tips on how to back up your pictures , find , protect , and use photos again . we focus on the process for digital photo photographers the &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; use . we view the download , ren@@ ame , remove , group , archive , optimize , wait and export image files .
&amp; quot ; Digital inventory management takes on , index@@ ed , sec@@ ures , sec@@ ures , searches , trans@@ forms , assem@@ bles and exports content that has a monetary or cultural value . quot ;
metadata is defined as data about data . metadata is , according to your definition , data that provides information about or documentation of other data managed by an application or environment .
I dare to claim that if you have more than 1000 photos on your computer then you need to find a specific photo for longer . if you do not even know how many photos you have , then do not use &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; . the approach to store metadata in a database as well as in the image files guarantees very quick searches and a secure archiving on which you can freely access with other programs , platforms and formats .
the first thing you need to do is the structure of information structure in contrast to the data structure . your image files must somehow be organized on your computer . you have to decide whether you want to have other access to your photos , whether you want to save them to a reserved drive or on a network drive &amp; etc .
maybe you will be happy with this structure . holiday pictures can quickly be found across your location , unless you were in one year several times at the same place . if you make enough photos , then you will use sub@@ folders such as &amp; eg ; 2008 @-@ 01 , 2008 @-@ 02 &amp; etc . export is then a folder for images that you print or publish on a website .
professional photographers have other requirements , such as ver@@ sion@@ ing photos , archiving , work@@ flows , constant supply of pictures on different topics and a large number of everything . within 10 years 95 % of archives and 5 % work files will have and you will not want to re@@ organize your structure for this content .
what types of files fit together ? separation of file types makes batch processing easier . separate new from old files .
the separation of original and working files simpli@@ fies a backup strategy and migration . you will always know if you are looking for an original or a deriv@@ ative image .
we also recommend the option to save metadata into &amp; digi@@ ti@@ ate the metadata settings page . this ensures that EX@@ IF and IP@@ TC data can be written to the file . if you forget this , then you can subsequently save the metadata from the database into the files by selecting the appropriate dot in the Album menu .
now you have a lot of information in your database , but what happens if you want to change which ? add &amp; digi@@ GET ; give them a metadata editor for a number of selected attributes . these are of course the most important ones .
now the real work starts , since you should now assign keywords , let@@ tering and an evaluation to each photo . of course , you can select all the images that need the same attribute and then set the value . this makes sense because you can concentrate on the best photos during further work .
now let &apos;s talk with keywords , keywords as you frequently call other programs , or categories . all three are syn@@ ony@@ ms for the same thing .
if you import cat@@ alo@@ gu@@ ed images from another source with embedded keywords , then &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; automatically build the tree for you or paste the images to the right place . sorting the hierarchy inside the tree is no problem and can easily be done by drag@@ ging one sub @-@ tree to another .
the graphic shows how different metadata inter@@ s@@ ect . this is a very rough representation as each block of metadata is in fact composed of many sections . file names and calendar data are properties of all images .
enough of keywords - the next section refers to lab@@ eling or comments , the third important tool to catalog your metadata .
most people don &apos;t want to just let anyone see your photos , they want to share them with your friends , family , other photographers and agencies . you are sure to be interested in how your photos will arrive .
from the distance is not even a nice beach panorama . if you consider it closer then you begin to see some details , people , the place .
and now I tell you that this is the landing place of the Al@@ lies &amp; quot ; O@@ ma@@ ha Beach@@ quot ; in the French Nor@@ mand@@ y 60 years after landing . w@@ ow ! you begin to dream of having associations , memories , the historical period is again present , you may even hear the silence .
for others looking at your photos , the title may be more important than the image itself to generate an interest . if you show pictures you should tell a story . remember , the key is to convey the meaning to the viewer , to help him about the motif that you moved to understand what you understand .
it is fine if a picture is not perfect if it has the strength only to work with a label for itself alone .
with &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; you can save as much text , in an internation@@ alized alphab@@ et ( UT@@ F @-@ 8 ) , as lab@@ eling . K@@ DE even provides you with a spell ch@@ ecker . if you export your images in web galleries , then these labels will not tell you a second time according to your wishes in the lab@@ eling and / or the title of the web gallery system .
remember the times ahead of GPS ? when you had to find another city without a navigation system ? was it not a boring planet in front of Google Earth ? well , because with pictures the train of the spatial presentation now drives with speed of light .
the possibilities of utilizing ge@@ olo@@ cation are already inn@@ um@@ erable and become even deeper in the future . I am sure that one day , in the near future , you can virtually repeat your travel using pictures with ge@@ ographic information . this then shows the photos at the location . you can also export the images to Galler@@ y@@ 2 , Pic@@ as@@ a@@ web , Fli@@ ck@@ r &amp; etc ; with the Goo@@ gle@@ Maps viewer .
&amp; quot ; Copy@@ left is a word play with copyright and design@@ ates the practice to use the copyrights to remove restrictions on the distribution and modification of copies . the same fre@@ ed@@ oms also apply in all changed versions , so also for the work of others .
the following description tells you which information in the setup page of &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; as information should be depos@@ ited :
author ( syn@@ onym for creator and author ) : this field should contain your name , or the name of the photographer who created the photo . if it is not desired to use the photographer &apos;s name , e.g. to protect the identity of the photographer , then the name of a company or organization may be used . this field does not support comm@@ as or sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ ons as separ@@ ator .
author Title ( syn@@ onym for author &apos;s line ) : linked to the author . this field contains the name of the photographer . examples of this can be titles such as : employee photographer , freel@@ ance photographer or independent commercial photographer . since this is a comment to the author field , this must be completed as well .
publisher ( syn@@ onym for provider ) : use the provider field to identify who offers the photo . this does not necessarily have to be the author . if the photographer is working for a news agency such as Reu@@ ters or Associ@@ ated Press , these organizations can be listed here that you offer the picture to others .
it is very important to fill the author and copyright sections , although they do not offer protection against mis@@ use . anyone who has a little more than basic knowledge in working with calcul@@ ator can delete or modify them in the picture . for private individuals , this is only of little interest to the majority of your photos . for professionals and semi @-@ professionals , this protection is very important .
the digital water@@ mark is unique per image . &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; will provide such a module for batch processing in the near future .
topics : disk failures , disk failure , current impacts , EC@@ C , transmission errors , aging of storage media , recovery , redund@@ ancy , aster@@ ance prevention , life time , temperature , data size , spread super@@ sti@@ tion
of course , we don &apos;t talk about CDs that were lost on the street or on a fire . these kind of losses are the same ones that can happen to you in traditional paper photos or neg@@ atives . in this section we are talking about problems with the so @-@ called new media .
K@@ roll on@@ TRA@@ CK , the world &apos;s largest data recovery company , has some interesting statistics which reasons a data loss has .
to combat the problem with CDs / DVDs , these must be treated carefully and you may not be trusted more than a couple of years . of course , you can also buy CDs and DVDs in archive quality which are longer , harder to get and much more expensive . there are offers about gold coated DVDs , &amp; dollar ; 2 the piece that takes a lifetime of 100 years for itself .
CD / DVD discs can become un@@ readable , but you can reduce this risk in which you use good disks and good recording devices and store them in the right way . the best DVD recording devices are not much more expensive than the cheapest , but you write a lot more reliable .
CDs and DVDs are very suscep@@ tible to errors , even if you have just written . that &apos;s why they use a check@@ sum mechanism to protect yourself . 75 % of the data are only effective data , the rest we need for form@@ atting and check@@ sums . despite this massive protection they age through chemical aging , ultra@@ violet light , scrat@@ ches , dust &amp; etc .
for faul@@ ty CDs and DVDs , there is a cheaper software called I@@ so@@ Bu@@ ster that works wonders for CDs and DVDs . it runs under Windows and &amp; Linux ; but is not yet available for Mac@@ s . there are also similar applications to read the damaged data from damaged disks , hard disks , flash media , USB drives , etc .
optical media : Blu @-@ ray discs seem to capture the format war against HD DVD . a dual @-@ layer Blu @-@ ray disc can store 50 GB and thus almost six times the capacity of a dual @-@ layer DVD with 8.5 GB .
slowly burn with a good recorder on high quality media in a non @-@ propri@@ ate format . after that , you should read the media with a description , date &amp; author and afterwards store on a clean , dark dry and protected spot . do not forget to copy the data to the next generation of media before you read the last piece of hardware or software that can read the media .
disk manufacturers retain their statistics for themselves . their manufacturing capabilities include a new disk , but not the data . Google provides a large field study on the fault mechanisms of hard drives on this subject : disk failures
shortly : dis@@ cos are the longest when you operate in the temperature range from 35 ° C to 45 ° C. The most common cause of error is S@@ MAR@@ T . electronic parts of the controller are the most common cause of error . some of S@@ MAR@@ T &apos;s errors den@@ ounce the im@@ min@@ ent failure . these are particularly readers and publishers . the expected lifetime is between 4 and 5 years .
this is only the complete loss due to over@@ voltage . of course , you can also lose data loss due to a power failure before you have secured the files , but these losses can normally be recovered without any major problems .
while most electric devices account for electric sho@@ cks not much , this can cause severe damage in devices with computer chips and high @-@ speed processors . these can cause persistent key@@ boards , complete data loss , hardware aging , destroyed mother@@ boards and other defects . so protect yourself from the unavoi@@ dable that leads to a loss of time and money .
the most common protection against sp@@ ik@@ es is a over@@ voltage protection . this is a device that absor@@ bs a part of the energy heat and gro@@ oves the rest . it is usually available in the form of a connector . remember , however , that not every connector bar also contains over@@ voltage protection .
if you are looking for an over@@ voltage protection , you should make sure that it meets the UL 14@@ 49 standard . this guarantees a certain minimum of protection . you should also take care that it provides protection against lightning strike and thus protects the correctly connected devices .
since an over@@ voltage of any cable can be used to your computer , you should be aware that even all peripheral devices connected to your system are protected . this also applies to telephone lines and cable mode@@ ms , as there is also a telephone connection for your modem . others offer connection options for the co@@ axial cable of the cable modem and the TV card .
if you have a not@@ ebook , you will need a portable over@@ voltage protection . a variety of these devices are especially developed for not@@ ebooks and are therefore very small and they also contain the protection for the modem .
while over@@ voltage protection protects your system against minor fluctuations in the power lines , it will not really help you in a complete failure . even a failure of a few seconds can lead to the loss of irre@@ plac@@ eable data . therefore , it can be useful to invest in an un@@ interrupted power supply .
in addition to the protection against over@@ volt@@ ages , these devices can automatically provide battery power if a power failure occurs . this gives you the possibility to save your data and to shut down the system . if you buy a UPS then you should be sure that it meets the same quality requirements as an over@@ voltage protection . furthermore , the lifetime of the battery and the supplied software is interesting .
consider the potential risk that your computer system is exposed to and compare its safety in electricity problems with the cost of avoi@@ dance of this . a high @-@ quality over@@ voltage protection can get you up to &amp; euro ; 20 . this is only a small price difference if you consider how well your computer is protected with it . finally , you should always remember to burn all the cables before you go on holiday .
the Amazon Web service includes S3 - Simp@@ le Storage Service - a simple storage service . with the right configuration you can mount it as a drive under &amp; Linux ; , Mac , and Windows . this allows you to use it as a backup destination for your software . Google Shar@@ ed Storage is another popular offer with which you can store any amount of data .
they are very expensive compared to the hard drives at home - 40 GB costs &amp; dollars ; 75 per year and 400 GB cost &amp; dollar ; 500 . in addition , you have to send the data over the compar@@ atively slow Internet .
the solutions are therefore only suitable as a solution against a local data loss of the most important images . this is not a bad solution , but it is not a general securing solution .
Pic@@ as@@ a@@ web ( Google ) , Fli@@ ck@@ r ( Yahoo ) and the photo community 23@@ h@@ q@@ .com provide online storage services that are fed to photos . your free storage is limited to 1 GB and you will not want to have your pictures in full resolution online . the professional version will provide you more , in case of Fli@@ ck@@ r dramatically .
the web solutions are very safe from the point of view of data backup . transmission errors are automatically adjusted thanks to the TCP protocol and in the large companies the offer includes a backup and a distributed storage . thus , they are not aster@@ oid .
the diagram shows the elements of the transmission chain in the machine . all transfers are pr@@ one to transmission errors . the file system Z@@ FS and b@@ tr@@ fs provide at least the data integrity between operating system and hard drive .
the worst thing about it is that no one tells you if a transmission error occurred , not when it happened in your hardware . all of these distur@@ ban@@ ces remain und@@ et@@ ected until one day there is no protection for it . nobody seems to have thought about it . nobody seems to have thought about it . the Internet with its TCP protocol is a much safer data path than that in your computer .
un@@ reliable power supplies are another source for transmission losses because they generate inter@@ ferences within the data streams . in normal file systems , these errors remain un@@ noticed .
even if you are not particularly affected by transmission problems , you should look into the future . in 2010 , you will see thousands of errors per year .
Z@@ FS by Sun Micro@@ systems seems to be one of two candidates who are able to deal with disk failures on a low level and are highly scalable . it is open source , with many patents and is available under a license for Solar@@ is and Leopard . we can only hope that it is soon available for &amp; Linux ; and Windows is available .
Oracle has started its own initiative with its b@@ tr@@ fs file system , which is still in the alpha state . it uses the same protection mechanisms used by Z@@ FS and is also available for &amp; Linux ; however , it is not part of the kernel .
do not under@@ estimate this ! these two factors are responsible for 86 % of data loss on not@@ ebooks and 46 % on work@@ station systems . in case of not@@ ebooks , the percentage of th@@ ef@@ ts is 50 % .
data loss due to viruses is less common than most think . it leads to less damage than e.g. theft or new installations . and it is currently limited to Microsoft systems ; Apple users only know very few viruses and under &amp; Linux ; no longer has been spot@@ ted .
open Source File Systems are less vulnerable to data loss than proprietary systems : wrong , NT@@ FS is minimal better than ext@@ 3 , Rei@@ ser@@ FS , J@@ FS , and X@@ FS to name the most common file systems .
journ@@ aling file systems prevent cor@@ rupted data and data loss : false , only the speed of the investigation process during an operation is higher and an un@@ defined status is avoided . however , if a file was not completely saved before the problem occurred , it is lost .
viruses are the biggest threat to digital data : false , theft and human error are the main causes of data loss .
sensors from digital cameras are 1 @-@ 2 aper@@ ture settings removed from fundamental physical limits . it is meant that while technology continues to evol@@ ve there is a natural limit for this progress . sensitivity and noise characteristics for all types of light sensors are no longer far from this limit .
today &apos;s cameras go towards the 10 meg@@ apixel sensors . even if this resolution is already too high for compact cameras and the end result is more likely to deteri@@ or@@ ate . even DSLR cameras have your limit at 10 @-@ 12 meg@@ api@@ x@@ els . for higher resolutions , you need a full format sensor ( 24x@@ 36@@ mm ) or larger formats .
you get a 750@@ GB hard drive today for 100 &amp; euro ; so do not charge anyone else for data loss . therefore , 6 % of all PCs are affected by a data loss every year . so , secure your data according to a plan and test this backup before you make anything dangerous like the re@@ installation of your operating system , the replacement of disks or the res@@ izing of hard drives .
suppose you make your f@@ uses on an external SATA drive every day . if , then one day , a flash hits you luck when the drive was not connected at the moment .
a disaster strikes locally and destro@@ ys a lot . forget aircraft accidents : fire , water , electricity , children and th@@ ef@@ ts are dangerous for your data . they usually affect a whole room or the entire house .
therefore , disaster prevention is always a non @-@ local storage . bring your back@@ ups up the stairs , to the neighboring house , in your office or similar .
there is another advantage of physical separation : as mentioned above , there is a common reason for a data loss in spite of securing the panic . if you have a backup that is not immediately available , then you can save that one day .
complete backup : a complete backup of all files to be backed up . it is a snap@@ shot without history and represents a complete copy at a time .
differential lock : a backup of the files that have been changed since the last complete backup . creates a complete snap@@ shot at two time points : the complete backup and the last differential lock .
incre@@ mental backup : a backup of the files that have been changed since the last backup . creates multiple snap@@ shots . you can restore the original status at any time on which such a backup is made . this f@@ use comes to a ver@@ sion@@ ing system the next with the exception that it is only scann@@ ed and not ongoing .
r@@ sync is a wonderful little tool that you can easily set up on your machines . unlike script @-@ controlled FTP sessions or other types of file transfer scripts , r@@ sync copies only the difference of files that have really been changed . this is compressed and if you want to increase security over ss@@ h .
backup important images directly after you have saved them on your computer to a DVD or other optical medium .
this approach allows you enough time to detect and restore losses . at the same time , you come for backup but with &amp; lt ; 130 % of the size of the working files . in the end , you have a complete daily version of the last 7 @-@ 14 days , a weekly snap@@ shot for at least one month and a snap@@ shot for each month . any further di@@ lution should happen manually after you have made a complete review .
topics : metadata , image file stored IP@@ TC information , associated XMP files , original retain , memory , scal@@ ability , media , retri@@ eval of images and metadata , copy the images to the next generation of media , applications , operating systems , virtu@@ alization , viewing appliances , ... , use of the Internet .
in order for valuable pictures to survive the next 40 years , that is about the period in which you really are interested in you because they remind you of your childhood or youth , there are two strategies that should be noted :
since the future is unfor@@ es@@ een due to your nature , you have to consider all that is going on today with caution and re @-@ evaluate during the time . unfortunately , there is no other way to manage a certain vig@@ il@@ ance . every 5 @-@ 8 years you should ask yourself how the current system is backwards compatible . the less variants you used in the past , the easier it is to evaluate the questions of the future .
this question should actually be answered by the explanations in this document . use or switch to open standards supported by many applications .
virtu@@ alization is available for everyone nowadays . so if you have an old system that is important to read your pictures , keep it up and install it in a virtual machine for later use .
on the other hand , the advice is quite simple : every time you change your computer architecture , your memory and backup technology , or your file format , you should check your library and if necessary convert to a newer standard . stay with open standards .
scal@@ ability is the specialist expression for the ability to change a system in its size . this actually means increasing .
let &apos;s assume that you have planned the scal@@ ability with you and the area you want to enlarge on a dedicated disk or partition . with * nix systems like &amp; Linux ; you can copy this area and reloc@@ ate it to a new disk :
check with the d@@ mes@@ g command to see if your new record was detected by the system , but don &apos;t app@@ end it .
&amp; dollar ; d@@ d if = / dev / s@@ db &#91; # &#93; of = / dev / s@@ dc # Source is / dev / s@@ dc &amp; dollar ; Part@@ ed res@@ ize / dev / s@@ d@@ c@@ 1 0 &amp; lt ; size of disk in MB@@ S ; # works with ext@@ 2.3 , F@@ AT@@ 16 , 32 and rei@@ ser@@ fs &amp; dollar ; res@@ iz@@ e@@ 2@@ fs / dev / sad@@ c@@ 1 # change the size of rei@@ ser@@ fs if necessary
open source standards have the big advantage of an open specification . even if one day no more software can be read , you can create them yourself . this task is made easier by year to year .
GIF is a proprietary , patented format that disappears slowly from the market . therefore , you should not use it any more .
PNG has been developed as an open source standard that should replace the GIF . it can save much more . it is los@@ s@@ less , supports XMP , Ex@@ in@@ f and IP@@ TC metadata , 16 bits per color channel and full transparency . PNG may recommend relative many administrative information , but not as many as TIFF and have a slow communication . we would like to recommend this format to save your pictures .
TIFF was widely distributed as picture format . TIFF can be stored in un@@ compressed form or in a container with los@@ s@@ less compression algorithm ( DE@@ FLA@@ TE ) . however , with some cameras you can save your images in this format . therefore , there are more than 50 different types and not all applications can work with all types .
DNG The Digital Neg@@ ative File Format is a licence @-@ free and open format format developed by Adobe Systems . it is designed based on the TIFF / EP format and obli@@ ges to the use of metadata . a hand@@ ful camera controller is already available and we hope that the competitors Canon and Nikon use it some@@ time .
this may be one of the reasons why , around 2001 , Adobe introduced its XML @-@ based XMP technology to replace the &amp; quot ; Image Resource &amp; quot ; technology of the n@@ ine@@ ties . it is a label technology that allows users to em@@ bed their data into a file itself . the file information is stored with the extension &amp; quot ; .x@@ mp@@ quot ; stored for XML / R@@ DF .
many photographers prefer to archive an original of your photo , mostly in raw format , as it stores the metadata separately from the image file . however , there may be problems when linking between the metadata file and the image file , and as mentioned above , the raw format is ob@@ sol@@ ete . therefore , you should consider whether you use DNG as a container and put everything together .
the Dublin Core Metad@@ ata Initiative is an open organization that supports fully compatible online metadata standards that support a wide range of applications and business models . the activities of D@@ CM@@ I include the work on architecture and modeling , discussions and collaborative work in the D@@ CM@@ I communities and the D@@ CM@@ I work groups , annual conferences and workshops , standard connections and enlighten@@ ing efforts to achieve a wide acceptance of metadata standards and practices .
import images from the camera , the card reader or the scanner . as long as the images are on the camera edi@@ um , you can use this as a temporary backup .
convert raw files to DNG and save them to your raw archive . this function is not yet implemented .
for a fine @-@ lay@@ ered processing , you can use external programs . if you edit the images again with &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed , then you should add the metadata again . these were , under certain circumstances , cut off from the other programs .
protect the copy@@ ri@@ ghted images for copyright with a digital water@@ mark . only export them into web galleries , code in MPEG , use in contact sheets , print &amp; etc ;
the camera interface is not the only way to get your photos in &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed . in section adding a photo to an album , you will find a description of how you can add photos you already have on your hard drive . however , the camera interface provides you with many advanced settings for import@@ ing images to your Alb@@ at@@ aten@@ bank .
to use &amp; digi@@ ti@@ ze your digital camera , connect them to the computer , turn the camera to display mode and turn on . for more details , refer to the manual of your camera .
when you start the camera interface , it tries to connect to your camera . with some cameras it may take a while . if the connection is made , a thumb@@ nail indicator appears at the bottom and the thumb@@ nails of all photos on the camera will be displayed . if this is the case , the fil@@ en@@ ames and a symbol for the application will be displayed for each file , photos , movies , music , etc. on the camera .
before you download the photos on your computer , you may need the camera information for each entry . with the side bars properties and metadata from the camera interface , you can see the properties of an entry or its metadata .
this dialog displays file properties and photo information that are stored internally by the camera . a symbol indicates that the image has not yet been downloaded to your computer . note that some digital cameras do not have all the information available .
the tab Metad@@ ata displays the internal metadata such as Ex@@ if , Manufacturers &apos; Screen , GPS etc . this information is the same as the Metad@@ ata page bar , or the image processing . note that this metadata is not available for some digital cameras .
the easiest way to download photos on your computer is the click on the Download button and then download the selection from All . this will download all photos from your camera in a single album in &amp; digi@@ ti@@ . . downloading the photos will not be deleted and we advise you to check if the photos were safely downloaded to an album before you delete the photos from the camera .
if you do not want to download all the photos , you can only select the desired ones with the standard selection methods from &amp; k@@ de ; once you have selected the photos , use the Download button and then download Sel@@ ected . the selected button can be downloaded as long as you have selected some photos .
if your camera supports this , a new option is available for download . in this case the new pictures have been selected with a star in the preview window . if you choose this option , only the new pictures will be downloaded .
if you are using the All button or download selected button , a dialog will pop up with which you can select the target album in which the photos are stored . you can read the list of the existing albums in the My albums section . then select the target album from the list and press OK .
after you have selected the target album , press OK , and &amp; digi@@ ti@@ h ; load the photos from the camera to the album .
once you have downloaded the desired photos , you can delete them from the camera . you can delete all of them at once by using the Del@@ ete All button . if you want to delete only some , then you have to select them first and then delete selected delete .
please note that there is no way to recover photos that you have deleted from the camera . so you should carefully check if the photos have been successfully loaded into a &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed album before you delete them from the camera . if you want to completely er@@ ase the camera file , you should do so via the camera &apos;s menu , as this is much quicker .
cameras use as file names for the photos often not particularly meaningful names . the fil@@ en@@ ames are usually re@@ used after the photos are deleted from the camera . this can lead to dup@@ licate fil@@ en@@ ames , if you load photos from different recording series into the same album . therefore , it may be useful to integrate the date and time the image has been made into the fil@@ en@@ ames .
in the next section you will find options for turning and mirr@@ oring the image and for date based sub@@ sets . if you use this latter option , a folder will be created automatically per day .
the options Dur@@ ing the transfer open three more options that are performed before the photos are stored on the disk . if you select this , the corresponding entries are copied from the Ex@@ if information into the IP@@ TC fields . with the last option you can correct date &amp; time for all downloaded pictures .
for example , if you prefer a different date format than the default format , you can use the pre@@ fix - % Y@@ - % m@@ - % d % H : % M : % S e.g. in the edit field . to do this , turn on the date &amp; time option . for further adjustments you should read the help of the str@@ f@@ time command .
if you use the option camera file name , you may have the option to change the file names in lower case letters , or in upper@@ case if you prefer this .
the new fil@@ ename , the &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; used for a photo , is displayed below the name that the camera provides in the preview . your settings to ren@@ ame will be saved and used automatically when you open the camera window next time .
&amp; digi@@ ti@@ ate ; can use all information about the orientation of the camera at the time point of recording to run an automatic rotation during download . not all the cameras provide this information . in the page bar page , you can read more details about the information that your camera embedded in the photo .
the automatic rotation is usually turned on , and if your camera does not deliver this information , it lets you digi@@ ti@@ ze ; the photo in original orientation . if you want to turn off the automatic turn , use the Advanced button and select Automatic Turn in the bottom of the window .
if your camera provides information about the date the photo was made , you can use it to automatically create sub @-@ albums in the target album . all pictures with the same date are loaded into the same sub@@ directory . not all the cameras provide this information . in the page strip met@@ a data you can read what information your camera could have embedded in the photos .
this option is usually switched off , and digi@@ ti@@ zed in this case ; the photos directly in the target album . if you want to change this , you need to turn this option on . to do so , use the Advanced button and select the date @-@ based bas@@ kets on the bottom of the window .
the easiest way to upload photos from your computer to your camera is the download button . then select Up@@ load . the file selection dialog &amp; k@@ de ; appears where you can select the files you want to upload . you can also select more than one file using the default &amp; k@@ de ; methods .
after the image selection is done , ask &amp; digi@@ ti@@ ze ; you where the images should be uploaded . a folder selection dialog appears for the camera . select the folder and press OK to start the upload . the images will not be deleted from your computer .
GPS ( Global Posi@@ tioning System ) is used as a general term in this document . this refers to a position indicated in length and width grams and which can be displayed on a map . the data can be determined by the American GPS , the Russian GL@@ ON@@ AS , the European GA@@ LI@@ L@@ O or any other system .
not only for professional photographers it can be interesting to link an image with a precise geographical location . not everyone uses an air@@ plane to map a territory by automatic recording of GPS data . environmental planners , military , police , architecture offices and real estate agents can use this ability .
if you have forgotten where exactly the photo was taken , you can open a browser with a click that shows the area . if you want to send a postcard to another , user who can locate the location of the photo , or just want to document that aspect , it is good to save the position data of a photo .
the question is , how do the GPS data come into the picture ? first , you should know that ex@@ i@@ 2 supports many GPS data fields , such as the direction , the sem@@ it@@ ones and map references ? there are at least three ways to achieve this . directly with the right hardware , about a re @-@ processing of the GPS data and image files with the K@@ IP@@ I module for ge@@ ographic assignment ( manual ) and last via the manual input of known places .
as far as we know there is currently no camera that has integrated a GPS unit . but there are a few who work with GPS recei@@ vers . either as card module or by transmitt@@ ing data with a cable or Bluetooth .
camera with GPS interface : Co@@ y@@ ot@@ e@@ Eye i@@ PA@@ Q I@@ ke Ko@@ da@@ k D@@ CS Pro Nikon DSLR Ric@@ oh Pro G3 Sony
downloading the GPS data from a device can be done with g@@ ps@@ man or g@@ ps@@ b@@ abel . however , you must save this data in g@@ p@@ x format as this is the only format supported by the ge@@ ographic assignment module .
there are different programs for &amp; Windows ; and Mac OS , which can extract and cor@@ relate the data from images and from GPS . on the following page you can do the same on &amp; Linux ; make : g@@ ps@@ Cor@@ r or g@@ ps@@ Photo
if you know the long@@ itude and latitude or other data then you can use this script that works with the ex@@ if@@ tool of Phil Har@@ vey . it uses the acci@@ dent@@ als of ha@@ iry co @-@ ordin@@ ates , such as map@@ s.@@ goo@@ gle .
map@@ s.@@ goo@@ gle@@ .com does not show any European road maps . here are some European sites , at least in French , German and Spanish , which show all navigation details for Europe .
&amp; digi@@ p@@ ation ; tries to give you as much control over its workflow as possible . there are many settings that change the behavior of &amp; digi@@ ti@@ . to access these settings , you need to set up in the Settings menu ; the Settings dialog is divided into eight pages . you can switch between these by clicking on the icons of the left side .
select action can be displayed on saved preview or start image editing . so you place the default behavior of &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; fix when you click on an entry in the main view .
this page contains , as shown below , the Stand@@ ardi@@ denti@@ ty and Copyright Data . these data are automatically written into the corresponding IP@@ TC data fields if the option was selected from the camera interface when downloading . even with a database synchron@@ ization , these data are written into the IP@@ TC fields .
author &apos;s title is a syn@@ onym for author &apos;s line : this field should contain the photographer &apos;s profession . these can be names such as photographer , freel@@ ance photographer or independent commercial photographer . since this is a more detailed description of the author field , this must also be filled .
publisher is a syn@@ onym for providers : use this field to specify the photo . this does not have to be the author if it works for a news agency such as Reu@@ ters or Associ@@ ated Press , then these organizations should be listed here , then the group or agency that provides the picture should be listed here .
the IP@@ TC actions store the data in the corresponding IP@@ TC fields . this ensures that the metadata is permanently included in the image and not only in the &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed database ; this metadata is also available to other programs and can be imported into &amp; digi@@ --@@ without being lost .
save images as embedded lab@@ eling ( J@@ FI@@ F ) in JPEG images : this synchron@@ izes the comments you add to your photos , with the in@@ scrip@@ tions embedded in the images . note : in images that already contain in@@ scrip@@ tions , they are over@@ written by digi@@ ti@@ zing .
the Settings page contains all the information that appears when the mouse is resting in the main window over a file . depending on the selected option , this information will be displayed or not .
&amp; # 160 ; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; supports a number of different image formats and some video and audio formats . to specify which file types &amp; digi@@ p@@ ation ; to show , you can add and remove the file extensions of this list . each file in a &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; album folder that has none of these extensions , by &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; ignored .
the default settings can be reset again by pressing the Update button on the right of each category .
setting &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zing settings can be set to the default values on this page . however , every time you open the brightness , these settings are not available . however , some pictures have different sizes and the synchron@@ ous mode is not available . if you have one , then you can get better picture results .
by default , image editing uses a black background behind the displayed photos . if you prefer a different color , you can select it here . you can turn off the tool@@ bar when you use the image processing in full screen mode .
over@@ - and under@@ exposed areas of an image can be marked with a dark or bright color in the picture . these colors are specified here . in the image processing , this View Mode can be switched on and off using F@@ 10 and F@@ 11 .
with chro@@ ma sub@@ sampling it is meant that the images are enco@@ ded in a higher resolution of the lumin@@ ance than in the color information . please read this article in Wikipedia for more explanation .
with the PNG @-@ compression setting , you can reduce the size of PNG files . this operation does not reduce the image quality as PNG requires a los@@ s@@ less algorithm . if you have a fast computer , you can set this value to high compression . this means 1 : a low and 9 a high compression .
with the option to comp@@ ress TIFF files , you can use the DE@@ FLA@@ TE compression algorithm for TIFF photos . this reduces the size of TIFF photos . it has no impact on image quality , since the DE@@ FLA@@ TE algorithm works los@@ s@@ less .
with the adjustment of los@@ s@@ less JPEG 2000 files , you can save los@@ s@@ less . even if you select the los@@ sy settings , the relationship between quality loss and file size is far better than with normal JPEG . when this paragraph is written , metadata has not been supported yet , but was in the planning .
in previous versions of &amp; digi@@ p@@ ation , image editing was just a picture viewer for photos . currently , it is rapidly becoming a tool for manipul@@ ating your photos . with this dialog , you can change the image editing settings .
the standard assumption is that all green pixels are the same . if the straight green pixels of the CCD sensor react more sensitive to ultra@@ violet light than the pixels with odd lines , this difference creates a mesh pattern in the output . if you use this option , solve this problem with a minimal loss of details . this option draws the image a little soft , but elimin@@ ates the 2x@@ 2 grid pattern using the V@@ N@@ G- or the A@@ HD quality method .
if this option is set , the white balance of the camera is used . otherwise , if set , the automatic color balance is used .
this setting is only used if the white balance is not set . standard is to use a fixed color balance , which is based on a white card that was photograph@@ ed in sunlight .
this setting is only supported for Fu@@ ji Super CCD SL@@ R cameras . using the second sensors has the effect that under@@ exposed images in four steps get more details in the top lights . this option is ignored for other cameras .
the standard is it the pointed lights , so the parts of your images are burned into the settings due to the in@@ ability of your camera to view the pointed white . to do so , use the setting of solid white in the settings . the setting colors will cause some unusual results , as they will attempt to recon@@ struct some parts of the missing information from the top lights .
this is possible because blue pixels are generally not as fast as green and red . &amp; digi@@ p@@ ated ; and d@@ cra@@ w therefore try to recon@@ struct the missing green and red parts from the yet uns@@ atur@@ ated blue pixels . of course , this is a question of how much color or white you want .
if you select the option re@@ constructions , you get the possibility to set a level . here , a value of three is a compromise and / should therefore be adapted individually for each image .
set the lumin@@ ance value according to your taste . you probably have to set it slightly higher than the standard 1 . however , this can also be done later in the image options of the &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; -@@ image processing . in order to keep the time for the Dem@@ os@@ a@@ icing , you should proceed conserv@@ atively .
a Dem@@ os@@ a@@ icing algorithm is a digital image process to calculate a complete picture of the partial raw data coming from the color filtered image sensor that many cameras have and which provides a matrix color pixel . this algorithm is also known as C@@ FA inter@@ pol@@ ation or color reconstruction .
&amp; digi@@ ti@@ ate ; and D@@ cra@@ w provide you with three alternatives : bil@@ ine@@ ar , V@@ NG inter@@ pol@@ ation and A@@ HD inter@@ pol@@ ation . after some tests it looks like this . V@@ NG inter@@ pol@@ ation ( variable number of gra@@ dients ) was the first algorithm used by D@@ cra@@ w . however , it creates color art@@ ef@@ acts on the edges . bil@@ ine@@ ar is interesting if you are looking for a quick fix with an acceptable result .
if you know the color devi@@ ation of your lenses you can set the red and blue correc@@ tions here . this is certainly the best method for color ev@@ asion , since you are carried out during the blank conversion .
a profile transl@@ ates the color information and gives instructions such as these should be given again . there are also L@@ CMS and &amp; digi@@ p@@ ation ; information such as the colour information of a color space in the other languages can be translated to make the colors as accurate as possible .
behavior Ques@@ tions if an image is opened in image processing / Color management module with raw files start .
color Profile Fol@@ der can be used to set the folder , such as / usr / share / color / ic@@ c or / home / user / .@@ color / ic@@ c , where you can save all your profiles . &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; then examine these folders during startup .
settings of the ICC profiles you have here the possibility &amp; quot ; standard squ@@ ot ; for your profiles to be depos@@ ited . everything can be changed when opening the raw file later .
the color management view is an alternative to X@@ cali@@ b or Ar@@ gy@@ ll . here , only your images are color @-@ managed not the entire screen .
the input profiles should match the camera and model you use . not all profiles are created in the same way . there are some , like Canon that do not have color mapping or g@@ amma correction . currently , d@@ cra@@ w g@@ amma does not correct for conver@@ sions at 16 bit depth . this means that you have to perform the color mapping itself .
there are other options such as the Soft Pro@@ of Profile , with which you can em@@ ulate how your image would be returned from a device . this is very useful before you print image as your printer has a smaller color range than your camera and some colors can therefore be very saturated .
for most cameras , it is quite obvious what color profile is intended for . unfortunately , not on the models of Canon . therefore , here is a table of cameras and profiles that fit together . of course , this answer is un@@ official :
the Canon profile extension lets you recognize the style for the finish : F for an exact style , L for landscapes , N for neutral , P for portrait and S for the standard style .
K@@ IP@@ I is the &amp; k@@ de ; Image Plugin interface . it is an interface that is supported by a number of &amp; k@@ de ; image viewer and image processing . by deplo@@ ying this interface , &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; many modules that have been written to work with any program that supports the K@@ IP@@ I interface .
if your distribution has the K@@ IP@@ I modules installed , you will see a list of available modules . select the ones you want to use , and these will then be loaded by &amp; digi@@ .@@ These modules will appear as new entries in the main window menu and in addition , you will also find some in the context menu of the preview .
short commands for tasks performed by modules can be set in the menu under Settings .
more information ( in English ) about K@@ IP@@ I modules can be obtained from the K@@ IP@@ I project on htt@@ p : / / www.@@ ki@@ pi @-@ plug@@ ins@@ .org or in the manuals of the K@@ IP@@ I modules .
the settings of the slide show should be easy to understand . the upper knob adjust@@ s the time between the image transi@@ tions , usually 4 @-@ 5 seconds . the other check boxes turn the metadata on or off , which are displayed at the bottom of the images during the ad .
the camera features show on the left side a list of all the currently supported cameras . on the right @-@ hand side there is a button Automatic detection , which tries to identify a camera connected to the computer . if you want to use this , make sure the camera is properly connected , switched on and in the image display mode . currently , serial , USB and USB / Fire@@ Wire mass storage are supported .
at the bottom you can set the path for USB and Fire@@ Wire ( IEEE @-@ 13@@ 94 or i @-@ Link ) mass storage cameras . this field is only active if you have selected a USB or Fire@@ Wire mass storage camera from the camera list . you must specify the path , / m@@ nt / camera or / m@@ nt / zoom , on which you mount your camera .
to use &amp; digi@@ ti@@ ze your digital camera , you need to connect the camera to your computer , bring it to the display mode and turn it on .
check out if &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; the camera automatically detects . if not , you can set camera model and port manually . after you have set up your camera , your camera will appear in the camera &apos;s menu .
you can select any name for your camera . this is displayed in the main window &apos;s main window . if you have more than one camera , you can insert all of them here .
with the confirmation dialog option for drag@@ ging &gt; images in the tr@@ ash@@ ers , you can adjust the conversation between &amp; digi@@ .@@ When del@@ eting a photo in an album , you can find more details when del@@ eting a photo and del@@ eting an album .
the editorial changes caused by the right side@@ bar can be tac@@ kl@@ ed sil@@ ently by &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; if you use the option to apply changes in the right side@@ bar without asking back questions . otherwise , you have to save the changes with the button changes .
you can also display &amp; digi@@ ti@@ ze the display of the welcome screen ; this acceler@@ ates the boot process of &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed under certain circumstances .
the setup At start for new photos is forcing &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zing ; searching the base folder for new or deleted albums / photos . this extends the start time of &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; . if something has been deleted from the base folder , ask &amp; digi@@ power ; you know if it should delete it from the database .
different color schemes can be in &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; used to customize the main window to your taste . these settings can be selected from the tool@@ bar under Settings . a preview of the available designs is listed below :
these designs are defined in plain text files . if you are interested in creating a new design for &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zing , you will find more information about this in this tutorial .
&amp; digi@@ ti@@ ate ; includes a fast image processing with some basic tools . you can use these to view your photos and to correct and improve . image editing can be started by clicking with the left mouse button on the preview of a picture or by the context menu of preview and selection of the item Adver@@ tis@@ ement / Edit .
the image processing includes a number of tools to improve your ima@@ gery . some of them are available as modules in &amp; digi@@ ti@@ . so you may not be part of your distribution . for more information on the K@@ IP@@ I modules , see the Image Processing section .
a status line at the bottom of the window , the file name , current file number , magni@@ fying factor and the current image size .
a menu bar at the top and below the tool@@ bar for quick access to the most frequently used functions .
the editing functions of the image editing change your photos . however , none of the functions will change the original photo before you save file Save or Save the Save button from the tool@@ bar . note that you can no longer recover the original photo as soon as you have saved the image .
so you may need to make a copy of your image before you change it . you can use it to save it as a file .
as long as you have not saved the photo , you can restore the original image by using the Rest@@ ore menu or Rest@@ ore image processing button in the tool@@ bar . you will then lose any change that you have done on the photo since the last save .
almost every image processing action can be und@@ one or restored . the last action can und@@ o you by modi@@ fying or recre@@ ating editing by selecting Edit Rest@@ ore from the menu .
if you frequently use this , you should re@@ vo@@ ke the keyboard short@@ cuts , C@@ trl ; -@@ Z to und@@ o C@@ trl ; -@@ Shift @-@ Z for re@@ producing .
if you press the &amp; L@@ MB ; hold a moment longer using the rever@@ t or restore button in the tool@@ bar , you will get a context menu . if you select one of the menu entries , all actions will also be und@@ one or restored in between .
once you have started the image processing , you can move between the photos on the same album or the same keyword by using the navig@@ ational buttons in the tool@@ bar , picture high , picture down or the entries in the File menu . if you have made changes to the current photo , you will be asked if you want to save them .
you can enter the photo and zoom out in which you use C@@ trl ; mouse wheel or the symbols in the tool@@ bar or the entries in the user menu .
to adjust a photo to the window size , you can use this button in the tool@@ bar : select En@@ larger Automati@@ cally
full screen mode shows the photo in full screen mode . you come in the normal view , in which you use the Es@@ c key . if you do not want this , you can also change it in the &amp; digi@@ plug settings dialog . you can view it from the &amp; digi@@ al@@ . view the section to set up the image processing .
if you want to print the current image , you can select the image in the File menu and get the default &amp; k@@ de ; print dialog . you can customize the settings here before you print your photo .
from the main menu you can print single images or whole sets . whole picture pre@@ views can be printed out of your selection . you only have to select the images with the standard methods and select from the Album Export job super@@ visor . if you follow the wiz@@ ard you just need to make your choice .
the &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; main window has a side bar at the right edge , providing important information and actions for the selected images . the same page strip is available , without the navigation path , also in the image processing . it is displayed when one of the five tab is cli@@ cked :
multiple clicking on the same tab lets the side@@ bar appear or disappear into the margin .
in the label view you can enter or paste in@@ scrip@@ tions with unlimited size . note that the text is UT@@ F @-@ 8 compatible . this means that all special characters are allowed . the labels are copied to the EX@@ IF and IP@@ TC@@ - fields so that you can be used by other programs .
the IP@@ TC data only supports ASCII characters and are limited to 2000 characters . all comments are cut off after 2000 characters and special characters are de@@ formed . if you want to use the IP@@ TC label in other applications , you should consider these limitations .
after you have commented on , use either the Apply button or simply switch to the next image , the labels are then saved .
in addition to the application button , there is a button called More . with this you can read more metadata from the selected file or the database . however , you can also write the metadata into the files . however , this is always done when you select a metadata setting that is always written in the images .
the rating section shows a rating scheme of 0 to 5 stars and can be used in search and sorting . it can either be applied with a single mouse click to the 5 stars in the side@@ bar or using the key short@@ cut C@@ trl + 0 ... 5 . to evaluate multiple images at the same time , select them and use the context menu .
the evaluation is written in the IP@@ TC field ur@@ gency . the coding is followed by the scheme in the following table :
the keyword view shows a search box for filtering the keywords , the keyword tree , and a drop @-@ down box with the keywords used previously in this &amp; digi@@ p@@ ation session .
the keyword tree is dynam@@ ically adapted to the entered search word . you can quickly restrict the number of possibilities in search for a keyword . this ability is particularly useful when you have many keywords .
the entry field at the bottom is a further relief when typ@@ ing keywords on a picture series . if you have entered different keywords , they are stored for quick access .
keywords can also be set by selecting the appropriate check boxes in the tree . all keywords of an image are stored in the keyword .
if multiple images are selected in the main view and you select a keyword in the keyword tree , this will only be applied to the highlighted picture and not on the entire selection , if you want to add a selection with a keyword , please refer to the section Key@@ word Filter .
the page header keyword filters is used to change the selection of images displayed in the main window . normally , the left side bar with their album , - date , drop and search view is used . if one or more keyword filters are used from the right , only the intersection of these two is displayed . all generated keywords are available .
you can also drag and drop keywords . suppose you have selected several images in the main view to provide you with keywords . if the keyword already exists , you can simply drag it from the right side@@ bar and put it on the selection . ther@@ eu@@ pon , a dialog appears asking you if you want to put the keyword .
in the upper example , the main window displays the images on a calendar day . the key@@ wor@@ d@@ filter is on No keywords , which reduces the amount to three images . they have been selected using C@@ trl + a , and then a keyword was drawn from the right @-@ hand corner tree to the selection and stored there . a dialog asks if this keyword is to be set .
this search for changes takes place at every start of the program . it can also be switched off under Settings Di@@ verse .
if you have a rule with and established that it is a or should be , you can easily change this with a double @-@ click on the text and in the control area .
( 1 ) : the entry that is searched for in the database . this can be an album , name , keyword , picture , key term , etc .
( 3 ) : the argument for the operator which is a name or string that is already set in the database .
for example , you can specify an extended search using all the elements in the database using the following options :
if you want to group options , you only need to use the check box at the end of the rule and then use the group button . the options will look like this :

this article / tutorial was mainly written by El@@ le Stone . special thanks to El@@ le for this work . I mainly adapted it to &amp; digi@@ dy ; s specific implementation adapted .
the reason why you use a color @-@ managed workflow is the colors that come from your camera or scann@@ ers to have a predictable devi@@ ation from the actual photograph@@ ed or scann@@ ed colors . with a color @-@ managed workflow , you can reach that the colors on your monitor resem@@ ble those of your camera or scann@@ ers and that match the colors you want to print or publish in the web to those from your digital dark@@ room .
when the theme comes to color management , everyone wants to know which buttons it needs to press for the results they want . unfortunately , color management means that you make informed choices at every point of image processing work@@ flows . additionally , you should provide you with sufficient background information about color management . in addition , you should allow you to make your own informed decisions so that you get the desired results .
if your workflow meets all six criteria listed below , you do not have to worry about color management .
you work on a monitor which is calibr@@ ated to the s@@ RGB colour space . ( see below for more information )
your only other picture editions are by email or web , where s@@ RGB is the de @-@ fac@@ to standard .
so if s@@ RGB functions so well and makes life so easy for everyone , why should one use another color space and think about color bl@@ ur@@ ging ?
a visual example of s@@ RGB limitation compared to the colors we can see is presented below . it shows a 2 @-@ dimensional representation of all colors that we can see , the hu@@ hor@@ ses@@ ho@@ e region , and the colors in the s@@ RGB color space , the tri@@ angular region .
if you want to compare the 2 @-@ dimensional representation of s@@ RGB with some larger coloured spots , please visit Bruce Lind@@ blo@@ oms &apos;s excellent site and click Info and then on Information About RGB Working Sp@@ aces .
do I have to calli@@ graphy my monitor if I chose to work only in s@@ RGB colour space ?
yes ! whether you &apos;re working in the s@@ RGB colour space or not , you have to calli@@ graphy your monitor since s@@ RGB is calli@@ graphy . if you work as RGB colour space , you need either to calli@@ bration your monitor on s@@ RGB , then you must either use your monitor on the s@@ RGB standard , use a matching monitor profile or both .

this tool provides five automatic correc@@ tions , which can improve a picture in most cases . therefore , use it before attempting to proceed manually .
the functions norm@@ alize , offset , automatic balance and contrast enhance from the menu Kor@@ rig@@ ate Automatic correction try automatically to make the best of your colors . you will need to experiment with these effects to see which works best with your photo .
norm@@ alize : this method scales the brightness values across the entire image , so that the dark@@ est point is black and the bri@@ ghtest spot becomes as bright as possible without changing its color shade . this function is often a magical correction for images that are dark or washed out .
balance : this method adjust@@ s the intensity factor of the colors of the selected image , so that the hi@@ sto@@ gram of the intensity channel becomes as flat as possible . this results in very good results in improving the contrast of an image , sometimes it produces only tr@@ ash . it is a very powerful operation that either causes miracles in a picture or destro@@ ys it .
automatic balance : this method maxim@@ izes color range in the red , green and blue channel . it determines the dark and bright colors and adjust@@ s the red , green and blue channels to the complete Hist@@ ogram range .
adding Con@@ trast : this method improves the contrast and brightness of the RGB values of an image by shifting the lowest and highest values to the wid@@ est possible area and a new ji@@ us@@ ti@@ zing of all values in between . this is only visible with balanced images and can be a good correction for bad photos .
the white balance of &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; is a semi @-@ automatic tool to perform the white balance of a photo .
the white balance correction is a little limited since a color space is worked with 8 @-@ bit per colour . if you are too far away from the original image , areas with over@@ exposure may occur . if you can carry out the white balance in the raw mode , which works in 16 @-@ bit mode , your possibilities for correction will be better .
this tool is based on a white balance algorithm of the copy@@ ri@@ ghted Pa@@ wel T. J@@ och@@ y@@ m protected . you start it through the menu entry Col@@ ors white balance of image processing .
the preview window can be adjusted in size . on the left side you can see both the original image and the preview of the target image . the preview will dynam@@ ically match the settings of the tool . if you want to see the original white balance , it is enough to click on the sub@@ window .
the preview of the target photos has a red marker . the lumin@@ ance of the pixel under this marker is shown as a vertical line in the hi@@ sto@@ gram .
at the top right , a hi@@ sto@@ gram shows that dynam@@ ically changes as soon as you change a parameter . this hi@@ sto@@ gram is very helpful , even in well @-@ lit pictures , most pixels are very small lumin@@ ance values . with a button you can decide whether one of the three colors or your sum is displayed .
the contrast of your result depends on shadow , satur@@ ation and g@@ amma . the shadow adjustment lets you improve or dim the shadow details of your photos .
to play An@@ stat with the above checks , you should use the color temperature pi@@ p@@ ette . press this button and then somewhere on the image preview to use the color temperature of the white balance . in this way , the temperature and green values will also be set automatically .
in addition , you can set the white balance with the default settings list . the following settings are available :
the exposure indicator increases the colors when more than one color channel of the pixels is over@@ exposed . you will get the combined result displayed in the white balance . this is shown in the preview as a pure indicator and has no effect on the final image .
the Save as and Up@@ load buttons do exactly that . each setting of the white balance you have set can be stored in a text file and loaded later .
the Pre@@ ferences button returns all filter values to their default values and neutral white balance . note that even neutral settings will result in a different photo than your original . if you save them , your original image will be changed .
you can set the encoding depth per color channel of the edited image here . 8 @-@ bit encoding is the widely used JPEG format , 16 @-@ bit encoding is better for high quality pictures . this coding also requires more disk space , computing time and is only available for the formats PNG , PN@@ M , TIFF and DNG .
this tool opens the same dialog as for the processing of raw images . it uses the change and as@@ signing color profiles . color ton@@ ing can be done through the sub@@ window for the brightness . a detailed manual for use of color profiles allows you to consult the chapter Color Management .
another important tool can be found in the menu under Col@@ ors Sound @-@ value Cor@@ rection . this tool provides an integrated way to adjust several color channels at the same time , so that you can use it for several photos . this is useful if your camera or scanner always makes the same error and therefore you always need the same correction . in the manual for ton@@ al correction you will find more information .
a very powerful way to correct exposure problems is the tool for gra@@ dation that you can find under colors gra@@ dation in the menu .
the Colour Upgrade tool provides four colour effects , a solar isation effect , a Vel@@ via filter , a ne@@ on effect and a edge filter .
in times of chemical processing solar isation , also called Sab@@ ati@@ er , was created when one replaced a partially developed pressure a short flash light and then the development of the picture completed . this had the effect that the lighter areas dar@@ ker and the colors were inver@@ ted by the second illumination . the result was a partial neg@@ ativity of the picture . this tool allows you to fine @-@ adjust this interesting effect .
the intensity controls the solar isation . at approx . 50 % intensity , the picture shows what is chem@@ ically possible . a further increase finally creates a negative image that is not to be generated on photo paper .
this is an example of the solar isation effect . the original image is the ( 1 ) and the applied intensity is 30 % .
the Vi@@ vid filter simul@@ ates the so @-@ called &amp; quot ; Vel@@ vi@@ aqu@@ ot ; effect . it differs from satur@@ ation by making a stronger contrast effect that makes the colors brilliant and glo@@ wing . try it simple , it emb@@ ell@@ ishes many photos .
Vel@@ via is the brand name for an inver@@ ted color film produced by the Japanese company Fu@@ ji@@ film . Vel@@ via offers very saturated colours in daylight and high contrasts . the characteristics make it a film of choice for nature photographers . Vel@@ vi@@ as strongly saturated colors are too much for some photographers , especially those who barely leave landscapes .
the ne@@ on filter simul@@ ates ne@@ on light at the contrast edges . the parameter level controls the brightness of the result and the sli@@ der re@@ peti@@ tions the strength of the ne@@ on light . for large pictures , the filter can rel@@ ieve the entire CPU for a moment .
digital cameras often have problems with light conditions and it is therefore not un@@ common that you want to correct the color contrast and illumin@@ ance of the photo . you can experiment on the various color aspects of your photo with the tools in the menu under colors . all your adjustments can be viewed in preview . once you are satisfied with the result use the button O@@ k and you will be applied .
if you make a photo in poor lighting conditions , you can get the opposite problem : a too big satur@@ ation . even in this case , the tool for brightness / satur@@ ation is a good choice to reduce satur@@ ation rather than increase it . all changes you can perform can be viewed in the preview . if you like the result you can confirm the changes with O@@ k .
between the complex tool Gra@@ dation and the simple Leu@@ ch@@ strength / Con@@ trast / G@@ amma , the tool is set to correct the exposure . even if the dialog for this tool is very complicated , you only need the area of the sli@@ der for the purpose described here . more concrete the three sli@@ ders below the hi@@ sto@@ gram .
the window contains a graph of the intensity values , a hi@@ sto@@ gram , the active channel or the selected area . below the graph , three sli@@ ders are cli@@ cked in and which can be moved to change the intensity values of the image . the left side represents the dark and the right side the bright areas .
the easiest way to learn is to move the controller and watch how the image changes .
on the right , the original and preview of the image can be viewed . the preview will be updated dynam@@ ically , based on the settings of the image . on the left , the following options are available .
sc@@ aling : with this selection box , it can be set whether the hi@@ sto@@ gram is represented with a linear or log@@ ari@@ th@@ mic y axis . for images of a digital camera , the linear hi@@ sto@@ gram is often dominated by a single column . in this case , the log@@ ari@@ th@@ mic classification is more useful .
three controls : the top for the dark tones , the middle for the bright sounds and the lowest for the middle tones , often called g@@ amma values .
the three color p@@ ettes can be used in the preview of the original image to automatically adjust the input values of the shadows , medium and light tones . in addition , there is a button for fully automatic adjustment .
output values : the output values allow the selection of manual values for each area . there are also two controllers that can be used to change the output values as inter@@ actively as in the input values . the compression of the output values can be used e.g. to create a f@@ aded image as background while something else is to be seen in the foreground .
automatically : with this button , the image values are automatically set depending on the intensity values of the image .
save as and load : with these buttons the set values can be stored in the file system and loaded later . to do this , the Gim@@ p Levels format is used .
if you use this mode and the three color pi@@ p@@ ettes , the input values will automatically adjust for all shadows , medium and sun shades . activate the color pi@@ p@@ ette that you want to use and click on the original image to set the input values of the hi@@ sto@@ gram for red , green , blue and lumin@@ ance channels .
the Over@@ exposure Indi@@ c@@ ator option controls all color channels to find over@@ exposed pixels and show you the combined result of all channels . this is an indicator , i.e. you only get the effect shown in the preview and no effect can be seen in the final result .
below is an example of the adjustment of input values applied to the red , green and blue channel of a photo . intensity and alpha channel , as well as the output values are unchanged . the original image is marked with ( 1 ) and the corrected picture with ( 2 ) .
the left side displays half of the original and the target image . the preview will be updated dynam@@ ically depending on your settings . on the right @-@ hand side , the following options are available :
modify channel : this selection box allows to specify the channel to be changed by the module :
in addition to this box , there are two symbols to switch between a linear and a log@@ ari@@ th@@ mic view . for images that have been taken with a digital camera , the linear mode is mostly the most sensible . in this case , the log@@ ari@@ th@@ mic mode will help .
for example , if you move a curve to the right , for example the bright sounds , then you can see that these bright sounds correspond with dar@@ ker output tones and the associated image pixels are dar@@ ker .
on the preview of the original photos a red marker is to be seen . if you move this marker to the area you want to change , a matching line appears on the curve displaying the original value . create a point on this line and then move it up and down until the value is adjusted to your taste .
save as and load : with these buttons you can do exactly that . each curve you created can be stored in the fil@@ esystem and loaded later . the file format for this is the Gim@@ p curve format .
if you use this method and the three color pi@@ p@@ ettes automatically create the control points of the curve for all channels of shadow , means and sun tones . activate the color pi@@ p@@ ette that you want to use and click on the original image to set the control points for the red , green , blue and lumin@@ ance curve .
the Over@@ exposure Indi@@ c@@ ator option controls all color channels to show over@@ exposed pixels . if you find more than one channel over@@ exposed pixels , you will get the combined result . this is an indicator , i.e. you only get the effect shown in the preview and no effect can be seen in the final result .
below you can see a black and white photo corrected in the lumin@@ ance channel . shadow and sun shades were set with the color pi@@ p@@ ette and applied to the curves . the original picture is ( 1 ) and corrected ( 2 ) .
the channel mixer of the &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; image processing is a tool to improve the color channels or change the color shades of the photo .
the channel mixer is another highly developed tool to mix the colors of the images . you can edit it from the menu Col@@ ors @-@ mixer of image processing .
the channel selection box allows you to select the color for the hi@@ sto@@ gram : this gives you a first indication of how to correct the channels by viewing the relative distribution and precip@@ itation . the left area of the window shows you a preview . the original can be viewed for comparison with your own rider .
the preview of the target image has a red marker . if you position it in the picture a vertical line in the hi@@ sto@@ gram will display the corresponding color value .
the controls for the module are right down : controls for red , green and construction allow you to mix these channels . if you activate lumin@@ ance , the picture will retain the general brightness even if you change the appropriate color components . this is particularly convenient if you are also the tool for generating great black and white conver@@ sions of your photos . try to reduce the green channel for black and white portraits .
sometimes , especially if you mix Mon@@ och@@ rome , the reduction of a color leads to a visible noise coming from the far@@ away . colour@@ less consists of small noise art@@ ef@@ acts that do not appear in the same place in the color channel and whose noise pattern looks different in each channel . if that is the case , you can improve your mon@@ och@@ rome conversion in which you first reduce color noise .
save and load buttons are used exactly for this purpose . you can save any bl@@ ender setting for later and then load . the used file format is the Gim@@ p channel mixer format .
the Over@@ exposure Indi@@ c@@ ator option controls all color channels to find over@@ exposed pixels and show you the combined result of all channels . this is an indicator , i.e. you only get the effect shown in the preview and no effect can be seen in the final result .
below you can see a photo in which the blue channel has been read@@ just@@ ed . the L@@ umin@@ ance option is enabled . the original image can be seen under ( 1 ) and the edited picture below ( 2 ) .
black / white photography has always been fascinating because of your ability to be abstra@@ ction . with the development of digital photography , black / white is a work step , since color images can be easily converted to the computer . also with a set of film roll profiles .
Il@@ ford Delta 100 , Il@@ ford Delta 400 , Il@@ ford Delta 400 Pro 3200 , Il@@ ford FP@@ 4 Plus , Il@@ ford HP@@ 5 Plus , Il@@ ford Pan@@ f Plus , Il@@ ford XP@@ 2 Super
green filter : simul@@ ates a black / white film exposure with a green lens filter . this looks great , with all scene pictures and fits particularly well to portraits against the sky .
Oran@@ ge@@ filter : simul@@ ates a black / white film exposure with an orange lens filter . this improves landscapes , maritime scenes and aerial photos . so similar to the 002 C@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) orange filter .
Rot@@ filter : simul@@ ates a black / white film exposure with a red lens filter . this creates dramatic cel@@ esti@@ al effects and can simul@@ ate lun@@ ar scenes at the time of the day . so , similar to the 003 C@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) Rot@@ ary filter .
yellow filter : simul@@ ates a black / white film exposure with a yellow lens filter . this is the most natural color correction and improves the contrast . it is ideal for landscapes and therefore similar to the 001 C@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) yellow filter .
S@@ emper@@ aton : produces warm light and medium tones while adding a bit of cold in the sh@@ aded tones . this is very similar to the process of the le@@ aching of a pressure and the re @-@ development in a s@@ epi@@ aton@@ er . this is typical of the photos of your grand@@ mother and therefore similar to the 005 C@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) se@@ pi@@ af@@ il@@ ter .
using the &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zing tool to apply texture you can apply decorative tex@@ tures to an image .
by adding a texture to your image , regardless of whether it is a color image or not , you can let it look like an oil painting on a canvas , the stit@@ ch of an old master , a pop art portrait of enlarged points or like a mur@@ al on a wall .
relief : shift this parameter to the right increases the appearance of the depth or three @-@ dimension@@ ality of the texture on the image .
a paper text effect has been applied on the photo below . the original picture is ( 1 ) and the modified one ( 2 ) to see . the parameter relief has been set to 200 .
adding &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zing ; adding tools frames can be added a decorative frame around a picture .
keeping the eye of a viewer in the confin@@ es of a photo is not an easy task . one way to keep his attention is to put the image a decorative frame . this is a psychological barrier for the sc@@ atter@@ ing eye .
type : with this parameter , you enter the desired frame type for your image . the image fli@@ rts with a thin line and a wide frame ( ideal for black and white pictures ) , ed@@ ged around it with a nice three @-@ dimensional frame which is ideal for a button effect and decorative inserts a decorative frame with patterns .
width : speci@@ fies the width of the frame in percent . the range of values for the width is limited from 1 % to 50 % .
the target image , decorated with the frame , will be larger than the original , but have the same aspect ratio . this is important for printing the images , especially if you have used the tool after aspect ratio before .
with this handy tool , you can easily insert a format@@ ted text into an image at any location . this can also be done at several places if you need it .
this tool is very intuitive to use . just enter the text and place it with the mouse . use text output , orientation , color from the color space and the character set with its properties as you need it . you will simply select a frame around the text and / or a semi @-@ transparent background .
any setting you have chosen for your text can be changed until you press the button &quot; OK . &quot; once the image has been saved , the text is part of the image . it cannot be changed any more .
with the &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; apply tool template you can put a sten@@ cil on a picture .
the Menu Image Tem@@ plate apply in the image processing can be used to place templates over a picture .
for the sten@@ cil there are no limitations regarding size and orientation . however , you must take the PNG file format and should work with maximum compression ( 9 ) to reduce the file size of the template . if you want to add your template of the &amp; digi@@ p@@ ated template database , just send an email in English to &amp; digi@@ kam ; mailing list digi@@ kam @-@ users @ k@@ de@@ .org .
if you use this tool for the first time , you need to put your sten@@ cil folder using the base folder in the dialog . select the folder in which you copied the sten@@ cil files . these settings will be shown for the next start .
after the root folder has been set for templates , a tree view that reflects the folder structure of the sten@@ cil folder appears automatically . the selection of a folder will automatically update the thumb@@ nail of the templates .
there are three buttons below which you can change the magni@@ fying factor and the position of your image .
enlarge : this knob enlar@@ ges the image below . it is centered around the position of the mouse . check it with the left mouse button .
shr@@ ink : this button shr@@ inks the image below . it is centered around the position of the mouse . if you want to apply the sten@@ cil on the whole picture , you have to shr@@ ink the image accordingly . check it with the left mouse button .
move : use this button to move the image below the template . to do so , take the picture and place it at the desired position .
use OK when you want to apply the template to your image . the image will then be adjusted automatically to the preview size .
&amp; digi@@ ti@@ ate ; provides three different tools for sharpen@@ ing . each of you has advantages in other areas .
sharpen@@ ing is a traditional tool for sharpen@@ ing . it is very fast and easy to create , but especially in dark areas , gra@@ iny pictures .
bl@@ ur M@@ ask works on the contrast of edges to make a picture shar@@ per look . actually , it does not sharp@@ ens a bit , it works rather psycho@@ visual . you can use it to remove atmospheric Dun@@ st and it makes a really good job . the algorithm has been taken from Gim@@ p and it is copy@@ ri@@ ghted by Win@@ ston Ch@@ ang .
re@@ focusing is possibly the best of the three because it really improves the sharp@@ ness . it is a little more complicated in its application and has different parameters to adjust .
images without focus as well as most digit@@ alized images require correction of sharp@@ ness . this is due to the digi@@ tization process to sum up colours with minimal differences to a col@@ oring point . this in turn leads to sharp edges becoming a bit bl@@ ur@@ red . this in turn causes sharp edges to be printed on paper . SL@@ R cameras typically need more after sharpen@@ ing than normal cameras for the private user .
for JPEG pictures , a camera has often been used for internal sharpen@@ ing . images in raw format , on the other hand , must always be sharpen@@ ed during processing .
some scann@@ ers use a sharp@@ ness filter while reading the image . if you disable it , you will get control of your image .
in some situations you can get usable results by sharpen@@ ing a photo using the sharpen@@ ing tool suit . this can be used with the menu item Kor@@ rig@@ ging sharpen@@ ing .
you should be careful , however , since the results do not work very natural : the sharpen@@ ing increases the sharp@@ ness of the edges , but increases the noise . in general , the most useful technique for sharpen@@ ing an image re@@ focus the tool . you can reach it via the menu entry Cor@@ ridor . under re@@ focus , you will find further information and a comparison of all techniques for sharpen@@ ing .
sometimes you have the opposite problem : a picture is too cr@@ un@@ chy . the solution to draw the image a little soft is much easier than to shar@@ pen . use the tool to use the menu entry Cor@@ rec@@ ise soft@@ ness and experiment with some settings . the preview window on the right side of the dialog will show you the effect on your photo .
the filter Un@@ sharp mas@@ king is a very good tool to remove v@@ eils from your photos . you can see a demonstration here .
the original image and preview help edit the image . the preview window shows the output of the filter with the current settings .
there are two important parameters , the radius and the amount . the default values often produce good results and should be tested first . an increase in the radius or amount enhances the effect . if you make the bl@@ ur of the mask too strong , noise and the impression of gr@@ ats are created near sharp edges .
the radius represents how many pixels on each side of an edge are affected by the filter . high @-@ resolution images permit larger radi@@ i . therefore , you should sharp@@ ens images in their final resolution .
the amount is the percentage between the original and the bl@@ ur@@ red picture added to the original . thus the strength of the sharp@@ ness is set .
the threshold is a fraction of the maximum RGB value and the difference between the difference . thus , a minimum difference can be defined thereby for an edge of the filter . in this way areas with a soft change between the tones are excluded from shar@@ pen and therefore avoid beauty errors in faces , sk@@ ies and water surfaces .
this is an example of the bl@@ ur@@ red mas@@ king filter . the original image is the ( 1 ) and the processed image the ( 2 ) . bl@@ ur@@ red mas@@ king was applied with radius = 6.0 , amount = 0.5 and a threshold = 0.@@ 0 .
the &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; tool re@@ focused re@@ focused a picture by improving the sharp@@ ness . it used the copyright @-@ protected development filter algorithm by Ernst Li@@ ppe .
this tool attempts an image to &amp; quot ; re@@ focused . this is better approach than just trying to shar@@ pen the photo . it uses a technique called FI@@ R Wiener Fil@@ tration . it uses a technique called FI@@ R Wiener Fil@@ tration . re@@ focusing is usually achieved to mask better results than bl@@ ur@@ red . you can start it from the menu by re@@ jec@@ ting colors in the image processing .
in practice , the circular folding works much better than the Gau@@ ß &apos;n F@@ itting . the Gau@@ ß ré@@ g@@ ime has a very long tail , which causes the mathematical result also from the source pix@@ els , which are far from the original qu@@ ell@@ pixel . in most cases , the in@@ verse of the Gau@@ ß &apos; folding is affected very strongly by the distant pixels . this causes un@@ desired results .
circular sharp@@ ness : this is the radius of the circular fold . it is the most important parameter for using this module . for most images , the default value should give 1 good results . you can set a higher value if your image is very bl@@ ur@@ red , but then pay attention to icons .
correlation : an increase in correlation can help reduce arti@@ facts . the correlation can be selected from 0 @-@ 1 . usable values are 0,5 and the values near 1 , &amp; eg ; 0,@@ 95 and 0,@@ 99 . a high value for the correlation reduces the sharpen@@ ing effect of the module .
noise filter : an increase in the noise filter can help you reduce arti@@ facts . the filter can accept values from 0 @-@ 1 . however , values higher than 0.1 are rarely helpful . if the noise filter is too low , &amp; eg ; 0 the picture quality is very bad . a high value will still pol@@ lu@@ te the image .
Gau@@ ß &apos; sharp@@ ness : this is the radius for the Gau@@ ß &apos; sharp@@ ness . use this parameter if your bl@@ ur is G@@ auss . this is most often caused by a previously executed bl@@ ur filter . in most cases , you should use this value to 0 to avoid anno@@ ying arti@@ facts . if you use a non @-@ zero value , you might need to increase the correlation and / or the noise filter .
matrix size : this value determines the size of the transformation matrix . an increase in the matrix size can produce good results , especially if you select great values for the sharp@@ ness or the gauge &apos; sharp@@ ness . note however that the module is very slow when you select great values for this parameter . in most cases , you should select a value in the range of 3 @-@ 10 .
the Save as and Char@@ ging buttons are used exactly for this purpose . any re@@ focused parameter you have set will be saved for later and can then be loaded .
try to perform all cutting , color and intensity correc@@ tions on the image before using the module .
otherwise , you should use the module before you change the image otherwise . the reason for this is that much operations do not immediately make changes that are not immediately visible , but later leave unpleasant art@@ ef@@ acts .
when you read and comp@@ ress pictures , &amp; eg ; as JPEG , you should apply the module to the un@@ compressed image .
generally , ung@@ od@@ ly mas@@ king produces better results than sharpen@@ ing . this could be caused by using the im@@ plant mas@@ king a larger neighborhood than sharpen@@ ing .
even under optimal conditions it can never remove the effect of bl@@ ur . for the Vi@@ enn@@ ese filter it is possible to show that it is the optimal Lin@@ ear filter . practically , the result of the FI@@ R Wiener Fil@@ ters is always at least as good as the bl@@ ur . the FI@@ R Wiener Fil@@ ters is often better when processing small details .
below you can see a comparison between the different filters , on a small un@@ focused image :
the original non @-@ sharp color image needs to be corrected . this image has been made with an analog camera . the un@@ focused result is due to insufficient light for the car focus lens .
for more information on the focal correction methods in digital pictures you can read a technical comparison in English at this address .
the sli@@ der smooth@@ es the bl@@ ur of the area that has been dark@@ ened to create a more natural pup@@ il .
the ink t@@ ink allows an adapted color for the pup@@ il . if you want blue eyes instead of dark , then you can adjust it here .
the image error correction tool is one of the most developed tools to remove unwanted arti@@ facts with unprecedented speed .
the In@@ painting algorithm has been developed by the I@@ MAGE team of the Gre@@ c CN@@ RS Lab@@ ors in Ca@@ en / France and is part of the C@@ im@@ g project .
this tool contains various pre @-@ settings as starting points to simplify the restoration process . the available pres@@ ets are listed below :
if you want fine adjustment of the filter settings , you can use tab smooth@@ ing and advanced settings .
attention preservation p &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this controls the preservation of the details . a small value leads to a smooth smooth@@ ness over the image . whereas larger values tend to smooth homo@@ geneous regions and keep details sharp . a value of 0.9 should be kept in such a way that no sharpen@@ ing is necessary subsequently .
direction dependen@@ cy Alpha &#91; 0,@@ 100 &#93; : a small value smooth@@ es evenly in all directions , while a value is fl@@ atten@@ ed close to 1 only in one direction . if you have a film gran@@ ular@@ ity or CCD @-@ noise , a high value produces wave @-@ like patterns . JPEG art@@ ef@@ acts are best removed with a value near 1 .
fl@@ atten &#91; 0 , 500 &#93; : this sets the maximum smooth@@ ing factor above all@@ . p then defines the relative smooth@@ ing . therefore , set this value corresponding to the degree of noise in your image .
regul@@ arity : &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : the higher this value , the more smooth@@ ed . this is necessary if there is a lot of noise , since it is difficult to estimate the geometry of the picture . even if you want to create a &apos; van Go@@ gh &apos; tur@@ mo@@ il effect it must be set higher than 3 .
re@@ peti@@ tions : specify how often the algorithm passes through . usually 1 or 2 is sufficient .
angle measurement as &#91; 5 , 90 &#93; : angle @-@ dependent integration of the an@@ is@@ otrop@@ ic alpha . if alpha is selected small , it should also be small . make sure that small angles produce a long run@@ time . thus , you should choose this value as much as possible and acceptable to your needs .
integrated stri@@ de width &#91; 0,1 , 10 &#93; : integrated stri@@ de width in pixels . you should set the value smaller 1 to avoid sub @-@ pixel pol@@ ishing and never larger than 2 .
use linear inter@@ pol@@ ation : the more quality you receive by selecting this option is only low , but it dou@@ bles the run time . therefore , we recommend it to be om@@ itted .
the Save as and load buttons do exactly this . any setting of image errors can be saved in a text file and loaded later .
correct image errors is compar@@ atively very fast at work . however , it can take a very long time and drag a high CPU load . therefore , you can cancel the calculation at any time with the Canc@@ el button .
below you can see how to remove image errors with small art@@ ef@@ acts . the module is applied on a photo that was made in Guatemala City with an analog camera . as you see , there is a strange black arti@@ fact in the foreground that caused by a bad film shift during the journey . the original image is under ( 1 ) and the corrected picture below ( 2 ) .
the &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; noise reduction is a very powerful tool to reduce noise . it uses a copy@@ ri@@ ghted algorithm by Peter Heck@@ ert .
this tool provides selectable image filters to remove stain@@ s and other art@@ ef@@ acts that come from dust or hair on the lens . it can also be used to remove sensor noise from the camera or Mo@@ i@@ re@@ acute ; -@@ effects of scann@@ ed images from books or magazines .
if you need further information on sensor noise from digital cameras , you can read them in English in this tutorial .
the scre@@ enshot above shows a typical scene that was made with a digital camera and a high ISO sensitivity . it shows a gra@@ iny noise that can be successfully removed with this tool .
the following is a complete description of all parameters . in most cases , you only need the details pane and the Advanced Settings window will remain in default settings .
radius controls the window size , from 1 ( 3x@@ 3 ) to 20 ( 4@@ 1x@@ 41 ) used for the filter . large values increase the time the filter is needed per pixel and can wi@@ pe the image . the area indicated by the radius turns over the image and the color in it is smooth@@ ed and thus minor bugs are adjusted .
sharp@@ ness : controls the sharp@@ ness level . this value sets the pixel pitch of the filter to the front to determine brightness changes . if it is increased , you may need to re @-@ adjust the edges of the filter if you change this setting . if the value is too high , the adaptive filter image details cannot be preserved and noise or lubrication occurs again .
edges : controls the edge accuracy for the sharp@@ ness . this value improves the frequency response of the filter . if it is too strong , not the entire noise can be removed or noise peaks may occur . set it to a value near the maximum if you want to remove a weak noise or JPEG art@@ ef@@ acts without losing details .
lumin@@ ance : controls the lumin@@ ance tolerance of the image . we recommend changing either color or lumin@@ ance to improve a picture . these settings do not influence the smooth@@ ing process that is controlled by the details settings .
color : controls the color tolerance of the image . we recommend changing either color or lumin@@ ance to improve a picture . these settings do not influence the smooth@@ ing process that is controlled by the details settings .
g@@ amma : controls the gam@@ bl@@ y@@ ance of the image . this value can be used to increase the tolerance values of the dar@@ ker areas , which are typically stronger , but also pol@@ lu@@ te the shadow areas .
d@@ amping : controls the adjustment of the phase j@@ itter@@ d@@ amping . this value defines how fast the adaptive filter radius re@@ acts to variations of the lumin@@ ance . if it is increased , the edges appear smo@@ other , if it is too high , noise and phase j@@ itter may appear on the edges . it can remove noise peaks and is the recommended method for it .
save under and load : these buttons are used exactly for that . all the parameters for the noise reduction you have set can be saved to the file system and loaded later .
this is an example of how noise reduction can change your life . the original image is marked with ( 1 ) and corrected with ( 2 ) . noise reduction was applied with the default settings .
sometimes a picture is too cr@@ un@@ chy for your purpose . the solution to draw the image a little soft is fortunately much easier than a picture to shar@@ pen . use this to shar@@ pen mol@@ lus@@ cs with the menu item Cor@@ rec@@ ise soft@@ ness and experiment with the smooth@@ ing . the preview window on the right side of the dialog shows the effect of this operation on your photo .
die &amp; digi@@ dig ; photo restoration is definitely one of the most advanced tools to reduce photo art@@ ef@@ acts .
this filter for restoration gives you the possibility to remove a lot of unwanted arti@@ facts from your pictures . it is very well adapted to remove Gau@@ ß &apos;s noise , film grain , scrat@@ ches , compression arti@@ facts and local errors that occur in digital , original or subsequently digi@@ tised pictures .
the same algorithm can be used for color and texture setting . the tex@@ tur@@ er &apos;s composition is carried out with a different tool , the image error correction . the restoration algorithm has been developed by the I@@ MAGE team of the Gre@@ c CN@@ RS Lab@@ ors in Ca@@ en / Fran@@ n@@ k@@ reich and is part of the C@@ im@@ g project .
reduce arti@@ facts : JPEG compression is not perfect , in some areas even very far from it . as a los@@ sy compression algorithm , it produces some compression &amp; quot ; Art@@ ef@@ actors quot ; - small standards that are shown in un@@ compressed image . this setting should correct these problems .
the Save as and Up@@ load buttons do exactly that . each setting of photo restor@@ ations can be stored in a text file and loaded later .
photo @-@ restoration is compar@@ atively very fast at work . however , it can take a very long time and pull a high CPU load . therefore , you can cancel the calculation at any time with the button Finish .
below you can be restored like a photo with uniform noise reduction .. The module is applied to a black and white photo that was recorded with a min@@ ol@@ ta ( t@@ m ) 700@@ Si camera on a Il@@ ford ( t@@ m ) HP @-@ 5 film with a sensitivity of 3200 ISO . you can see the not@@ orious screen on the faces . the original picture is below ( 1 ) and the corrected under ( 2 ) .
below you can see another example of the photo restoration . this time tex@@ tures were reduced to an old color photo taken with a scanner . you can see the scan art@@ ef@@ acts that were caused by the scanner illumination and the photo paper . the original image is below ( 1 ) and the corrected picture below ( 2 ) .
digi@@ ti@@ zed and digi@@ ti@@ zed ; tool Hot@@ pixel allows Hot@@ pixel images to be removed with a CCD camera gem , eight were to be removed . it uses algorithms from the JP@@ EG@@ A@@ xi project which are copy@@ ri@@ ghted by Martin Dick@@ opp .
bright , dead or hot pixels are a problem especially for high @-@ quality raw @-@ mode photos as many cameras with JPEG compression have a built @-@ in suppression for hot pixels .
this tool can be used to remove &amp; quot ; hot pixels quot ; and &quot; quot ; bright pixel quot ; on a photo with a dark image sub@@ traction method . there is currently no manual method to select the bad pixels .
download this file in the wiz@@ ard with the Dark Picture button . the tool will automatically recognize the hot and bright pixels . these are highlighted in the image preview .
if you have an old digital camera it is important that you take the dark image directly in the connection to detect new hot or bright pixels by CCD defects .
first , as described in the previous section , you should download the matching dark image to the image to be corrected . an automatic processing of the dark image will find the bad pixels . note that the wiz@@ ard re@@ members the last dark image and automatically loads it in the next session .
the image area and preview help to correct the result within the image . the preview window shows the output of the filter with the current settings . bad pixels are raised in all projec@@ tions .
select an area to preview the broken pixels on the preview and the results of the filter . then select the best filter method to inter@@ pol@@ ate these pixel blocks . these are the available filters :
average : an average of the adjacent pixel is determined . the resulting color is assigned to all the faul@@ ty pixels in the block . for a 1 @-@ dimensional inter@@ pol@@ ation this is made separately for the horizontal and vertical line .
linear : all pixels that have a distance of 1 from the pixel block are drawn to the calculation of a bi @-@ linear surface ( 2 @-@ dim ) or a group of linear curves ( 1 @-@ dim ) . these are then used to inter@@ pol@@ ate the broken pixels in the block .
square : this is the standard filter method . all pixels with a distance of 2 or less to the pixel block are drawn to comp@@ ute a bi @-@ square surface ( 2 @-@ dim ) or a group of square curves ( 1 @-@ dim ) , which is then used to inter@@ pol@@ ate the pixels in the block .
cubic : all pixels with a distance of 3 or less are drawn to comp@@ ute a bi @-@ cubic interface ( 2 @-@ dim ) or a group of cubic curves ( 1 @-@ dim ) , which is then used to inter@@ pol@@ ate the broken pixels in the block .
below you can see the Hot@@ pixel correction on a color photo taken from a defective digital camera with a sensitivity of 200 ISO and long exposure . the original image has been enlarged to 300 % ( 1 ) and the corrected picture is shown below ( 2 ) .
the digi@@ tis@@ ation correction is a tool to correct the vig@@ net@@ ting , i.e. under@@ exposed corners , of an image .
wide angle lenses , especially those in medium and large photo format , can often not illumin@@ ate the entire sensor area evenly . instead &amp; quot ; vig@@ net@@ ting quot ; ( sh@@ ady ) they reduce the corners and edges of the image by lowering the light that reaches the sensor there . teleph@@ oto lenses may also show this behavior .
however , it also has dis@@ advantages . many center filters require a factor 1.5 or 2 for the aper@@ ture filter , which increases the necessary sh@@ utter speed under certain circumstances , which makes it impossible to use the camera with the hand . wide angle lenses should also use a center filter , an aper@@ ture of f / 16 or smaller , because otherwise un@@ even effects are caused by movement .
with the large exposure ranges of today &apos;s cinem@@ atic and gray scales of digital cameras and film scann@@ ers , it is possible to simul@@ ate the effect of a Cent@@ er@@ Filter by applying an equivalent transformation to a rough image made without this filter . the tool Vig@@ net@@ ting correction applies the transformation using a Cent@@ er@@ filter to a picture . the algorithm is protected by copyright by John Walker .
with three regul@@ ators , you can control the correction of the vi@@ gn@@ ette and with three more the imaging of the target image .
density : this parameter controls the degree of light intensity at the point of highest density the filter . the standard density is 2.0 , which corresponds to an optical filter with a aper@@ ture setting of 1 , or random@@ ly a light intensity of 2 . increase the density to compensate for a greater degree of vig@@ net@@ ting , reduce it to compensate for a small degree .
lumin@@ ous intensity , contrast and g@@ amma settings : editing an image with the vig@@ net@@ ting correction reduces the brightness of the pixels . you need to adjust the exposure of the target image with these options . the controls only provide positive values , since you only need to increase the settings .
if you want a fine adjustment of the exposure of the target image , you let the values for lumin@@ osity / contrast / g@@ amma at zero and use the gra@@ dation from the &amp; digi@@ p@@ ation ; image processing from the menu Color gra@@ dation .
this is an example of the vig@@ net@@ ting correction applied to an image . the original image ( 1 ) shows the vi@@ gn@@ ette in the corners and ( 2 ) the corrected picture . a correction and contrast correction was also carried out in the image using this tool .
the &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; lens distortion is a tool to correct the impact of spher@@ ical lenses on photos . it uses a copy@@ ri@@ ghted algorithm by David Ho@@ d@@ son .
this tool works with geometric distor@@ tions . color distortion can not be corrected with this tool .
the coefficient of the second degree treats the general geometric distortion of the lens and can correct the con@@ cave or con@@ ve@@ x form of the image .
the coefficient of the third degree has a similar circular effect , but shallow at the edges . this correction is not applied in the tool .
the coefficient of fourth grade correc@@ ts the remote corners opposite to that of the second degree . if you combine these two , any geomet@@ rical distortion can be almost eliminated .
general : this value controls the strength of distortion 2nd degree . with negative values , any distortion can be corrected and positive values cushion distortion .
corner : this value controls the thickness of distortion 4th gra@@ des . this value appears more strongly at the edges than in the middle of the image . for most lenses , the &apos; Corner parameter &apos; has the opposite sign of the parameter General .
zoom : this value scales the image size and thereby correc@@ ts the first grade . negative values increase while positive the image decreases .
bri@@ ghten : this value adjust@@ s the brightness in the corners of the image . negative values decrease the brightness of the image in the corners while positive values increase it .
to help you find the best filter settings , the dialog provides a preview of the distortion correction . the values you use for your image will be saved and used as default values at the next start .
the T@@ onn@@ en- or cushion @-@ shaped correction should be performed before all cutting or res@@ izing changes . in the best way , perform this correction as the first . if you re @-@ cut an image and then perform a ton @-@ shaped correction the effect would seem apparent to the fal@@ con .
to help you find the best correction , this tool provides you a vertical and a horizontal line of assistance . move the mouse cur@@ sor in the image preview to display the dotted lines . move it to an important place , such as the edge of the sea or a building wall , in your image and press the left mouse button to fix the lines at this point . subsequently , you can correct the T@@ onn@@ en- / cushion distortion with the help of the lines .
if you correct a cushion distortion , the resulting image will have black corners . you can remove them using the cutting tool in the Trans@@ form Add from image processing or using the zoom regulator of this dialog .
the next logical step for some motives , e.g. images from the front , frame and paintings , is to correct the perspective so that all angles in the picture have 90 degrees . note that if you hold the camera with your hand , you will always have a slight distortion of the perspective .
this is an example of the barrel @-@ shaped correction applied to a church in Norway . the original picture is under ( 1 ) and the corrected picture below ( 2 ) .
the algorithm is based on a method to simul@@ ate inf@@ ra @-@ red movie of the G@@ imp@@ Gur@@ u.@@ org web page which is accessible under this URL . the filter re@@ produces the known Il@@ ford ( t@@ m ) SF@@ X@@ 200 I@@ Infrar@@ ot@@ film , see this URL . this film has a sensitivity range of 200 @-@ 800 ISO .
in the left side of the window , you can select the area for preview . if you move the red rect@@ angle with the mouse you can view the effect on different parts of the picture .
below the preview you can set two parameters for fil@@ ming and film sensitivity ( ISO ) . activate the option Ad@@ ding Film Cor@@ sage if you want to simul@@ ate the gran@@ ular texture of a highly sensitive film . the ISO sli@@ der changes the amount of film grain and the domin@@ ance of the color green ( chlor@@ ophy@@ ll in nature ) in transformation . green meadows are white like snow !
since the filter uses color channels to reproduce infrared , especially the green channel makes no sense to apply the effect on black / white photos as the color information is missing .
this is an example of the infrared filter applied to a landscape photo from New Zealand . the original image is below ( 1 ) and the processed image below ( 2 ) . the sensitivity of the film was set to ISO 400 . higher ISO values create a kind of au@@ ra in the top lights .
the &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; Filter film gran@@ ulation is an easy @-@ to @-@ use tool to reproduce film grain on your pictures . this is known from classic high @-@ speed films such as the B / W Ko@@ da@@ k Tr@@ i @-@ X . to increase the sensitivity of the films , manufacturers mix large silver grains of the photo emul@@ sion .
the film gra@@ zing effect gives your photo a certain mood or seems to shift back into the past . the treated picture gets rid of a timeless ambi@@ ance detached from everyday life . if you want this special , gallery @-@ like , street photography , gra@@ iny view specially in your mon@@ och@@ rome photos , you must use this filter .
with the regulator , the ISO sensitivity can be calibr@@ ated to control the intensity and gran@@ ular@@ ity of the grains . the default value is , although higher values are required , set to ISO @-@ 2400 . if you need more grains , you can apply the filter several times .
this is an example of the film grain effect applied to a black / white image . the original image is the ( 1 ) and the edited the ( 2 ) . the film sensitivity used is ISO @-@ 1600 .
the &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; filter oil painting generates the appearance of an oil painting . it uses a copyright @-@ protected algorithm of Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
the &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; filter oil painting gives your digital pictures a nice appearance like an oil painting . nature pictures and style life are good for this effect .
there are two kno@@ bs to influence this effect . the upper sel@@ ects the brush size between one and five . thi@@ cker brushes are better suited for large pictures . smooth@@ ing controlled the smooth@@ ing or , viewed from the other side , the hin@@ ge .
this is an example of the oil painting effect . the original picture is marked with ( 1 ) and the editing is marked with ( 2 ) . brush size for this 640 pixel is 1 and smooth@@ ed 17 .
the &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; Filter char@@ coal drawing uses color and intensity gra@@ dients to create a coal j@@ ze . images of whose gra@@ dients should change slowly are therefore not ideal for this effect . it is helpful if you imagine what scene you chose to sk@@ etch out . this would be good pictures to begin with .
there are two controls with a range of 1 to 100 to control this effect . the upper knob sel@@ ects the pin size and the lower knob adjust@@ s the contrast ( smooth@@ ing ) .
this is an example of the coal drawing filter . the original image ( 1 ) and the modified image ( 2 ) . the default settings of 30 and 10 have been used . the result can be further improved by adjusting the value value .
die &amp; digi@@ val ; Filter Grav@@ ure shapes your picture in 3 @-@ D , as if it was stamped in wax . it uses a copy@@ ri@@ ghted algorithm of Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
the filter en@@ grav@@ ings is a fast tool to restore your images with a 3 @-@ D effect . it works particularly well with images with a simple structure , in which color is not the most important content . the filter uses the differences between color and intensity to transform the image into a gray , mon@@ oton@@ ous landscape .
the depth allows to adjust the contrast of the filtering . a value of 30 , equ@@ als 10 % , is the default setting .
this is an example of the engraving filter . the original ( 1 ) and the processed image ( 2 ) . the used depth is 10 % .
with this filter group you can transform a normal photo into a work of art using distortion effects . it uses copy@@ ri@@ ghted algorithms from Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
wave blocks 1 : divide the image into cells and let it look as if it is seen through blocks of glass .
wave blocks 2 : analog@@ ous to the wave blocks 1 the picture is dist@@ orted with a different version of glass blocks .
some effects require long time to calculate and create a high CPU load . you can cancel these effects at any time using the button Finish .
with this filter group you can transform a normal photo into a work of art by means of infin@@ ity effects . it uses copy@@ ri@@ ghted algorithms from Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
zoom bl@@ ur : bl@@ urs the image along star @-@ shaped lines that eman@@ ate from a center . this simul@@ ates bl@@ ur a zo@@ oming camera and thus creates a dynamic expression of the often seen in sports photography .
radi@@ al bl@@ ur : bl@@ urs the image by turning the pixels around a center . this simul@@ ates the bl@@ ur of a rotating camera .
distance bl@@ ur : bl@@ urs the image to create the effect of a non @-@ focused camera lens . the object seems to step back into the background .
movement bl@@ ur : bl@@ urs the image through horizontal movements of pixels . this simul@@ ates the bl@@ ur of a linear moving , z : B : from a car or train photograph@@ ing , camera .
soft@@ ening Un@@ ity : wi@@ pes the image soft@@ ly into the dark and strong in the bright tones . this creates photos with a dre@@ amy and shiny soft focus effect ( Hamilton effect ) . this is ideal for creating romantic portraits , gl@@ amour photos or adding a warm and subtle g@@ low .
Sch@@ üt@@ tel@@ un@@ sharpen@@ fe : bl@@ urs the image by random shifting of the pixels and thus simul@@ ates the bl@@ ur of an arbit@@ rar@@ ily moving camera .
intelligent bl@@ ur : takes the paint tank in the picture and bl@@ urs them without changing the rest .
mos@@ aic : shares the photo in rectangular cells and then creates it , through the col@@ t with an average pixel value , new .
some effects require a long time to calculate and cause a high CPU load . you can cancel this calculation at any time with the button Finish .
the rain@@ drops are a nice little tool to make rain@@ drops on your image . this makes it natural to your pictures a wet appearance . it uses one of Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n copy@@ ri@@ ghted algorithm .
dro@@ ple@@ t size allows to change the size of drops . since the dro@@ ple@@ t size does not automatically grow with the size of the image it is often necessary to reduce the size for small images . number changes the number and density of drops . fish eyes changes the optical effect of dro@@ pl@@ ets on the image .
you can use the &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; image processing to keep an area free of rain@@ drops . to do this , use the selection tool to select the area , e.g. a face , which should remain free . if you then start the filter rain@@ drops , the area will remain free of rain@@ drops .
this is an example of the rain@@ drops filter . the original image ( 1 ) shows a calm sunset and the edited picture ( 2 ) indicates a sunset after a storm . the default values were used for this example .
if the photo has the wrong orientation , you can place it by mirr@@ oring or turning it into the right orientation . you can find the tools to use in the Transformation bar or transform mirrors .
photo bub@@ bles is definitely one of the most advanced tools to enlarge a photo at a minimum loss of image quality .
the big question is , how can you infl@@ ate a picture and keep the details sharp ? how can you zoom into a picture if the boundaries of resolution are reached ? how can you re @-@ inv@@ ent or guess the missing information ? the C@@ im@@ g algorithm used here makes a good work here . try it and you will see it yourself .
if a photo has the wrong size you can scale it to the desired size with the tool size . select to change size in the menu and enter the target values . the dialog is to be seen below .
change the tool to size uses a linear inter@@ pol@@ ation method to approximate the pixels . if you want to enlarge a small image with better quality then try the tool to infl@@ ate .
many image processing programs use some kind of inter@@ pol@@ ation , e.g. sp@@ line inter@@ pol@@ ation to enlarge a picture . &amp; digi@@ p@@ ation ; uses a further developed approach . the underlying algorithm photo bub@@ bles was developed by the I@@ MAGE team of the Gre@@ c CN@@ RS laboratory in Ca@@ en / France and is part of the C@@ im@@ g project .
you need to tell the tool how to change the size . these settings are available in the New Size tab and are listed below :
keep aspect ratio : when this setting is enabled , the aspect ratio of the original image is maintained when entering the new size .
regul@@ arity : &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : the higher this value , the more smooth@@ ed . this is necessary if there is a lot of noise , as it is then difficult to estimate the geometry of the picture . even if you want to create a &apos; van Go@@ gh &apos; tur@@ mo@@ il effect it must be set higher than 3 .
the Save As and Char@@ ging buttons are used exactly for this purpose . each st@@ utter for photo magni@@ fication can be saved as a text file and loaded later .
infl@@ ating photo is very fast with what it does , but it can take a very long time and drag a high CPU load . you can cancel the calculation at any time using the button Finish .
you can see below an example of photo bub@@ bles by enlar@@ ging a small color image to the double size . the original is ( 1 ) and the enlarged picture ( 3 ) . the preview ( 2 ) is the result of the linear standard magni@@ fication for comparison .
editing a photo is not only a frequently under@@ estimated surgery but also a frequently under@@ estimated tool to comp@@ ose a picture . to crop a photo you just need to create the rect@@ angle with the mouse , by pressing the mouse button and drag@@ ging the rect@@ angle . you will then see this rect@@ angle while moving the mouse .
when you release the mouse button again the area of the photo will be cut off . you can change the size of the area to be cut by drag@@ ging at the corners of the rect@@ angle . you can create a new rect@@ angle by simply drag@@ ging it with the left mouse button .
once you are satisfied with the cut , use the button The trimm@@ ing button of image processing in the tool@@ bar and the photo is cut ( C@@ trl ; + X ) . use the Save or File Save file from the File menu to save the newly cut image .
in the preview area you can change the size of the rect@@ angle by moving the corners with the mouse . the aspect ratio you have defined in the dialog will be preserved .
in the tool After Asp@@ ect R@@ atio , you can specify orientation as a portrait or landscape format . in portrait format , the greater value of the height and in the trans@@ verse format of the width is assigned .
cutting the tool After Asp@@ ect uses a relative aspect ratio . this means that it is always the same regardless of whether you use inches , inches or any other physical size . you can see e.g. below a list of traditional sizes for photo paper and their aspect ratio .
at the right end of the dialog there are two buttons to automatically center the selection horizont@@ ally or vertically .
at the bottom of the dialog , you can use the Max@@ . relationship button to set the area for cutting to the greatest possible , depending on the selected ratio and orientation .
when you use the cutting tool next time , these settings are displayed as default values depending on orientation . if you use the cutting tool next time , these settings are displayed as default values depending on orientation . the modified balance measurements are stored in the EX@@ IF @-@ tables so that the EX@@ IF data will reflect the cut image and not the original image .
the setup help settings allow you to show help in order to better put your pictures together . these help are :
harmon@@ ic triangle : harmon@@ ic divisions are based on the principle of simil@@ arity . like the third @-@ par@@ agus , harmonious tri@@ angles are a possibility to share a rect@@ angle in similar harmon@@ ic tri@@ angles at the diag@@ on@@ als .
golden center : the golden middle is a division which is based on various natural growth patterns , such as the spir@@ als of a Nau@@ til@@ us shell or the leaves of a sun@@ flower . it appears in all sorts of things that we feel as beautiful .
the golden division is the Ir@@ rational number 1,6@@ 18@@ 03@@ 39@@ 88 ... and it has already been used by ancient Egyptians and Greeks who constructed your temples and py@@ rami@@ ds . artists and architects have used the golden partition in all times when you put together your pictures , buildings and even photos to give your creations a natural order and beauty .
the number is derived from Fi@@ bon@@ acc@@ i sequence 1 , 1 , 2 , 3 , 5 , 8 , 13 , 21 , 34 &amp; etc ; the resulting divi@@ der is 1 : 1.6@@ 18 the golden center . a composition that follows this rule is regarded as visually harmonious .
the golden center provides liquid help lines when compos@@ ing a picture . these aids are listed below :
the Golden Spi@@ ral will bring you closer to your goal to achieve good results for your photos . compared to third @-@ party rule , the golden spiral creates a fluid line that can follow the eye through the image . this type of composition guides the observer &apos;s gaze along the line of the spiral and creates a symmet@@ ric visual river in this way .
one more rule are the rec@@ tan@@ gles of the golden spiral , also called golden rec@@ tan@@ gles . these rec@@ tan@@ gles are used to create the golden spiral . there should be something that the eye drops into the center of the composition . this can be a line or different objects .
the Golden Tri@@ angles also der@@ ive from the above @-@ discussed golden spiral . their ver@@ tices are the middle points of the sides of the golden rec@@ tan@@ gles . note that in contrast to harmonious tri@@ angles , golden tri@@ angles are not equal tri@@ angles .
if you use gold tri@@ angles to break your frame , create an effect that is called dynamic symmet@@ ry by professional photographers . try to place your focus on one of the intersection points and other visual information in the tri@@ angles . the result is a very attractive composition that you cannot achieve otherwise .
the options Horizont@@ al mirror and vertical mirror can be used to mirror the harmon@@ ic divisions .
with the Color button , you can set the color of the auxiliary lines . if you have a picture with many colors and a high contrast , the auxiliary lines can be invisible . in this way you can adjust the color of the lines to your current image .
the free rotation is a tool to rotate an image at any angle .
when you make a photo , it happens easily that you don &apos;t hold the camera vertically or horizont@@ ally . this creates a picture in which things are rot@@ ated around an angle . you can fix this with the &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; image processing and the tool free rotation . select transform free rotation and adjust the target angle .
rotate your image with the sli@@ der angle . the values on this slide are given in degrees . with the Pre@@ ferences button you can set the sli@@ der to 0 degrees . a preview of the rotation is available on the right side of the window . the new dimensions of the image are shown in the upper right corner .
for your help , the Free Rotation module provides a horizontal and a vertical line . move the mouse cur@@ sor in the image preview to position the two lines . after you have moved it over an important point of the image , you can fix it with a pressure on the left mouse button . now adjust the angle as described in previous section .
after you have turned a picture you will find un@@ desirable tri@@ angular holes in the corners . a way to fix this is to use the function Trans@@ forming C@@ utting out of the image processing .
an elegant way to crop the image is the Auto cut function . select one of the following options :
the Anti @-@ Ali@@ asing option calcul@@ ates the image a bit after the turn . however , note the warning above .
all per@@ spec@@ tival transform@@ ations are performed at a fixed point of the so @-@ called reference point . this point is in the middle of the picture and is represented by a red circle .
to change the perspective you have to use the red squares at the corners of your image . the preview will then be automatically re@@ comp@@ uted . on the right side of the dialog you will find some information to help you change the perspective :
new width : shows the width of the new image , including the empty areas created by the transformation into pixels .
new height : shows the height of the new image , including the empty areas created by the transformation into pixels .
angles at the top left : indicates the current angle in degrees at the upper left corner of the transformed area .
angle to the right : displays the current angle in degrees at the upper right corner of the transformed area .
angle left bottom : displays the current angle in degrees at the bottom left corner of the transformed area .
angle to the right : shows the current angle in degrees at the bottom right corner of the transformed area .
after adjusting the perspective , the image becomes a bit dirty . for a single adjustment , this effect is small , but two adjustments create a double that strong effect and you should avoid this if possible .
after you have adapted the perspective you get unpleasant tri@@ angular holes at the corners . one way to clean it is to cut the picture with trans@@ formers trimm@@ ing out of the image processing .
the locking tool is used to move a part of the image in one direction and move the other part into the opposite . a horizontal sh@@ ear@@ ing , for example , will shift the upper part of the image to the right and the lower part to the left . this is not turning , the image is turned into a parall@@ el@@ ogram . you can start this module by transforming sciss@@ ors .
sh@@ ears your image by using horizontal and vertical angle . if you press pres@@ ets , the angle will be reset to zero . a preview of the effect will be shown to you and the new dimensions of the target image will be shown to the right of the preview area .
to your help , a vertical and a horizontal line is displayed . move the mouse to an important point , such as the sea , a wall from a building on your image and press the left mouse button to fix the lines . you can now use the locking tool to adjust your image .
after you have done the she@@ ar , the image becomes a bit bl@@ ur@@ red . for a single sh@@ ear@@ ing this effect is mostly neg@@ li@@ gible , but two not@@ ches generating twice as much bl@@ ur@@ ging and therefore you should avoid this .
after the she@@ ar the picture has un@@ nice tri@@ angular holes in the corners . one way to eliminate it is to cut the picture with trans@@ formers trimm@@ ing out of the image processing .
&amp; digi@@ p@@ ation ; requires a number of libraries and other packages to read and write image formats . therefore , the available formats depend on your system and , in some cases , from the way these libraries were compiled . in most distri@@ butions you will be able to edit a large number of image formats with &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed .
because of this dependen@@ cy on other libraries , it is impossible to list all file formats available on their system at this point . however , you will always find JPEG and TIFF below .
&amp; digi@@ p@@ ation ; shows only files in formats that know . this is done using the file extension and a comparison of those with a pre@@ defined list . if the extension is listed in the list , then digi@@ ti@@ zed ; you can change this list of file extensions to &amp; digi@@ .@@ In the configuration section you will find more information on this .
almost all digital cameras store photos in one of two formats : JPEG or TIFF . some cameras allow you to select the format you want to use . a more detailed description of these file formats can be found in Wikipedia . &amp; digi@@ ti@@ ate ; supports both formats .
image compression is the application of data compression methods to digital images . redundant information is reduced to save image data to a more efficient way .
JPEG 2000 is also supported . generally , there are better , smo@@ other than JPEG at the same compression ratio . the 2000 version can also save los@@ s@@ less if specified in the settings .
if you want to learn more about the raw format , see Wikipedia , The L@@ umin@@ ous Land@@ scape and Cambridge in Colour very helpful tut@@ orials in English . you can convert raw format images in JPEG or TIFF using the raw image converter by &amp; digi@@ .@@ In the configuration section you will find more information on how to use modules with &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; .
&amp; digi@@ p@@ ation ; supports the loading of raw images only with the d@@ cra@@ w program included in &amp; digi@@ ti@@ es. more than 200 raw data formats are supported . all support cameras can be seen below on the web page of Dave Coff@@ in . the table below shows a short list of raw formats that were digi@@ ti@@ zed by &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed :
many digital cameras support recording short movies . these clips are often stored in avi or m@@ peg format . &amp; digi@@ ti@@ ate ; but is not a film editing program and therefore does not have any built @-@ in options to view or edit movies . if you click on a movie file &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; the &amp; k@@ de ; use settings to playback films to start the program playback .

if you change steps 4 and 5 , what you can do well if the initial contrast was already very good , then you can perform the first four adjustment with the white balance module .
many tools you need for editing the photo are in &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; your description follows here .
all image editing tools such as sharpen@@ ing , mol@@ lus@@ cs , noise suppression , re@@ focusing , mas@@ king , &amp; etc . . use a single dialog box that displays the effect in a preview before the filter applied to the current image . below you will see &amp; quot ; texture applied quot ; in this dialog :
( 1 ) : this progress bar shows the status of the filter on the current image . to the left of it , five buttons allow to change the comparison mode of the preview area . these modes are :
the left area shows the original and the right shows the filter applied to the area on the right of the selected area .
the upper section shows the original and the lower one shows the filter applied to the area below the selected area .
the left area shows the original and the right to compare the effect of the filter .
the upper section shows the original and the lower one for comparison the effect of the filter .
&apos;@@ Mouse over &apos; style : shows the preview if the mouse is not in the preview area and otherwise the original .
( 2 ) : there are two buttons you can turn on to display over and under exposure . the colors used can be adjusted in the general settings page .
( 3 ) : the frame to select the preview . you can drag this frame using the mouse inside the image and disc@@ ard it on the part of the image you want to preview . preview in the left part of the dialog will be updated immediately .
( 5 ) : in the lower left corner : here is a help and the possibility to reset all buttons to your default values . all settings from the last use of the module will be noted .
the page header features the essential information about the selected image and is largely self @-@ explan@@ atory . it is group@@ ed in the following sections :
photo properties : shows a summary of the most important parameters when shooting the photo . these data are from the EX@@ IF data when they are available .
this tab provides an intuitive map search tool based on the Marble Mini@@ range . you can press in or out with the mouse wheel or move it down . move it while you press the left mouse button . press C@@ trl ; left mouse button to draw a square . all images within these coordinates are filtered and displayed .
&amp; k@@ color@@ edit ; is an editor for pallet files . the application can be used to edit color pal@@ ettes and for selecting and nam@@ ing colors .
the Pall@@ ets files that are installed by &amp; k@@ de can either apply to the whole system or only one user . in the latter case , they are in your personal folder for &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ Settings and hot user @-@ defined color and last used colors .
in the palette , you can select from a list of installed pallets , or browse the folders by files .
the cur@@ sor is displayed as a line in the pallet view . it can be moved by clicking on the area next to a color .
the color is described under the palette . here , the color name can also be changed .
it can also be used to choose from . to create such a selection , click on the area next to a color to move the cur@@ sor there . then move the mouse with pressed left mouse button .
if the check box B@@ oth C@@ ursor is activated below the color button , the color is inserted from the color panel at the cur@@ sor . the color is either inserted or over@@ writes another ; depending on whether the mode over@@ write has been selected . this mode can be set by selecting the check box over@@ write under the mouse cur@@ sor .
a selection that was created as described in the last section can be used in conjunction with the copy , cut and paste operations .
&amp; k@@ color@@ edit ; uses the following format for data in the clip@@ board : for each color three values for the portions of red , green and blue and an optional color name followed by a line end sign if another color follows . if there are three numbers in the clip@@ board , these can be inserted as a color in &amp; k@@ color@@ edit .
the colors in the palette and the output of the color selection can be drag@@ ged with the mouse .
select a color somewhere on the screen and then find them in the color sel@@ ector on the left .
&amp; k@@ graph viewer ; is a K@@ DE program for viewing &amp; graphic ; -@@ dot ; graph@@ s . graph@@ s are used in science , especially in computer science . so far , there was no modern &amp; GUI ; program to visu@@ alize graph@@ s . programs that are &amp; graphi@@ vi@@ z ; programs are ob@@ sol@@ ete &amp; X11 ; - or &amp; t@@ cl@@ t@@ k ; programs with only a few functions .
the &amp; k@@ graph@@ viewer ; -@@ project aims to replace these programs with a modern and user @-@ friendly graphic interface with all the functions of a well integrated &amp; k@@ de ; program .
&amp; k@@ graph viewer ; is a K@@ DE program for viewing &amp; graphic ; -@@ dot ; graph@@ s . the &amp; graph ; programs are free layout programs . &amp; k@@ graph viewer ; shows graph with all the possibilities of a well integrated &amp; k@@ de ; program in a modern and user @-@ friendly &amp; GUI ; it has the following functions :
integration in &amp; kate ; and &amp; Con@@ quer@@ or ; ( so that a change in the graph in &amp; kate sp@@ ans the graph@@ s and shows in &amp; k@@ graph@@ viewer ; )
menu to open the graph@@ s in &amp; kate ; open or open the graph@@ ene in &amp; k@@ graph@@ viewer ; in a &amp; kate ; component

other required software : &amp; k@@ graph viewer ; is a &amp; k@@ de ; program which requires the &amp; graph ; tool &amp; dot ; for representing the graph@@ s required . in detail :
the main window displays the opened graph@@ s , each in its own sub@@ window . initially , when you start &amp; k@@ graph@@ viewer ; without starting an argument , the main window is empty as in the bottom scre@@ enshot . in this case , the tool@@ bar will only open the symbol file and the ( empty ) list will contain last opened files . click the first icon to open the dialog file .
after you have selected one or more &amp; dot files , the main window looks like in the bottom scre@@ enshot :
as you can see , an overview is displayed in the corner when the graph is larger than the drawing area . you can select a fixed position of this overview with the context menu or select this position automatically .
use the mouse wheel ( up and down without special buttons , left and right with pressed &amp; Alt ; -@@ key ) ;
zo@@ oming in both directions is limited by a factor of 10 . below , you see the maximum reduction of a graph .
if the file currently loaded in &amp; k@@ graphical , loaded file has been modified by another program , the following window will appear :
you can choose whether the graph should be rel@@ o@@ aded or if you want to ignore the change . &amp; k@@ graph viewer ; can also mem@@ ori@@ ze your decision so that later as well . if you want to change your decision later , you can set the menu item Con@@ figur@@ ing ... , see also .
if you open a graph file outside a running &amp; k@@ graph@@ viewer ; instance open , &amp; eg ; in the file browser or at the command line , you have the choice whether you want to open a new &amp; k@@ graph@@ viewer ; instance , or want to display the graph to be loaded in a sub@@ window of the current instance .
as with the last option , you can save your choice permanently , but also change it with the setup dialog afterwards .
when you start program , you can open all graph@@ s of your last session again . again , you can save your choice as well as later change .
you can also specify how the graph should be split into several pages . the number of horizontal and vertical pages can be chosen freely .
if you use several pages , you can choose whether the sections of the graph , which come on one side , should be adjusted to this page . if you maintain the aspect ratio , the pages may not be filled by the respective parts of the graph .
page preview with a page distributed across multiple pages without header and with a different font
the Er@@ ne@@ ut shop page allows you to specify the behavior when a file has been modified on the hard drive , &amp; eg ; from another program . you can set a default behavior ( automatically rel@@ o@@ ad or ignore the changes ) or ask the program each time .
the page opening gives the possibility to set the behaviour of &amp; k@@ graph viewer ; specify when a graph is opened outside of a current session . you can set a default behavior for this case ( open the graph in a new window or in a sub@@ window of the current session ) or determine that each time it is requested .
the session management page gives the possibility to set the start behaviour of &amp; k@@ graph viewer ; you can set a default behavior ( open or not open the files at the last session or not ) or decide to be promp@@ ted for each start .
the context menu , which appears in a single click in the main window with the &amp; R@@ MB@@ N , opens up additional options :
here you can choose between various &amp; graphical layout algorithms . the entries as described on the &amp; graphi@@ vi@@ z website are :
&amp; dot ; algorithm , the standard for directed graph@@ s . it produces hierarch@@ ical or lay@@ ered graph@@ s of directed graph@@ s . the algorithm lays the edges in the same direction ( from top to bottom or from left to right ) and then attempts to produce as short edges as possible and as few edge over@@ laps as possible .
the &amp; ne@@ ato ; algorithm is the standard for un@@ coated graph@@ s . it produces images according to the spr@@ ing@@ spring model . the Kam@@ ada Ka@@ wa@@ i algorithm is used , which is equivalent to statistical multi @-@ dimensional sc@@ aling .
the &amp; F@@ DP ; algorithm creates a spr@@ ing@@ spring model layout for non @-@ eri@@ tified graph@@ s . it uses the Fru@@ chth@@ man @-@ pure gold he@@ uris@@ tic , and includes a multi @-@ lat@@ ent for the handling of large and clust@@ ered graph@@ s .
the &amp; Cir@@ co ; algorithm as@@ signs the no@@ des circle shape according to the description of Six und Tol@@ lis , 1999 , and K@@ auff@@ man and me@@ adow , 2002 . it is useful for specific diagrams of multiple cycli@@ c structures .
opens a dialog where you can specify a layout command , then executed by a shell . the command should accept the graph@@ ite file as a parameter , and print the calculated layout of the graph to st@@ d@@ out in the x@@ dot format . with such a layout command you can add &amp; eg ; the &amp; graph , or change the graph with a filter before it is drawn .
speci@@ fies the type of graph ( directed or ung@@ eri@@ tified ) and applies the standard algorithm for the respective type ( dot ; for directed , &amp; ne@@ ato ; for non @-@ eri@@ tified graph@@ s ) .
if this setting is enabled , the overview is displayed if necessary . otherwise it is not displayed and the positioning menu is in@@ active .
displays the What is the mouse poin@@ ter . click on a &amp; GUI ; element to get further help to this element ( if available ) .
a list of changes is available under this address and in the file Ch@@ ange@@ Log in the base folder of the source archive .

the K@@ IP@@ I module provides tools to read and save new images .
this module can be used to read and save new images from external sources . currently , two sources can be used :
scan Photos : use the K@@ oo@@ ka interface to read images from a scanner that supports the san@@ e project or another source such as video streams . to do this you have to have K@@ oo@@ ka and san@@ e installed .
when you open the menu item images , a dialog appears , which lets you select between all available sources on your computer . here , select the source you want to get the picture . you can also set the default source for the next time .
after that , the K@@ oo@@ ka window appears by choosing the default default duc@@ r@@ he custom to select your image accordingly . view the preview and adjust the area to your needs before you start scanning the image . the estimated file size will be displayed in the right lower corner . in the K@@ oo@@ ka manual you will find more information .
make sure that the window will be displayed completely , as some settings may not be displayed otherwise .
after you have pressed the button scan , you need wait until the scan is complete and the window to set the options of the target image appears . please remember that the type BMP is not compressed and therefore creates very large files . you must also select the folder &amp; # 160 ; select or create the image to be saved .
scre@@ en@@ shots can be created after you have selected in the menu Imp@@ orted - &gt; screen photo ... a window appears in which you can adjust the different screen phot@@ om@@ o@@ di :
select the complete desktop to read a single window under the mouse .
if all your own program windows are selected , the calling program will disappear , so you can see other screens and windows . otherwise , after a short delay , read the currently visible work@@ space . if you have selected the complete desktop , only the window will be read under the mouse .
the delay determines how long screen shot will wait before it starts . if you need to switch to other working areas , you should select this delay quite enough to have the time to navigate there .
after the scre@@ enshot has been made , the dialog box appears with the options described above .

Fli@@ ck@@ r is an online photo broadcast on the Internet . Fli@@ ck@@ r allows you to send photos to people that are important . you can show your favorite photos of the world , put the photos of your camera online and show your photos safely and privately to your friends and family all over the world .
the Export to Fli@@ ck@@ r can be used to upload images from your computer to a Fli@@ ck@@ r server on the Internet .
when you use the module for the first time , you are guided through the process of generating a token . it is used for your authentication so that it is virtually your ID to Fli@@ ck@@ r . a browser is started to login to Fli@@ ck@@ r .
after successful login , the module can send photos to Fli@@ ck@@ r website . the following page will be presented to you after a successful login .
simply close the browser window and return to the program . after you have cli@@ cked on Yes , you will see the dialog to upload photos to Fli@@ ck@@ r . this will be shown in the next section .
if the module exports to Fli@@ ck@@ r to Fli@@ ck@@ r for the second time , you will be greeted with the following dialog , which displays the current access per@@ missions that the module displays . currently , the module does not support other per@@ missions . you will be asked if you want to continue with these per@@ missions .
the Add Photos button should be pressed once after you have set any other options . with this button you can select the photos you want to upload in a file selection box . if you press the O@@ k button start up@@ loading the photos to Fli@@ ck@@ r server .
the keywords field can be filled with a comm@@ a separated list of words . these are added to the image as a keywords during the upload .
with the Public , Friends and Fam@@ il@@ lie options , you can set the access per@@ missions to your pictures . by default , the photos are classified as private .
if you select the Change the size of the photos before up@@ loading , the photos will be changed before up@@ loading in size . the size is taken from the value registered with Maximum size .
the maximum size can be used to specify the maximum height of the images . the size is changed so that the aspect ratio remains constant .
the K@@ IP@@ I module gallery export is a tool to export your image collection to a gallery server .
the K@@ IP@@ I module @-@ export module has no documentation at the moment . if you are interested in writing them , please contact the mailing list of the K@@ IP@@ I team at k@@ de @-@ imaging @ k@@ de@@ .@@ or@@ g. Please note : the participants of this list speak English .
the K@@ IP@@ I module for ge@@ ographic location allows GPS coordinates to be added and edited in the metadata of a picture . the ge@@ ographic data is stored in the EX@@ IF database of the image and loc@@ alization can be displayed in a map in an external browser .
the K@@ IP@@ I ge@@ ographic location module provides tools to locate images ge@@ ographi@@ cally in the spher@@ ical coordinate system used by GPS and Galil@@ eo . height , length and width are used .
to cor@@ relate your pictures with ge@@ ographic data you need a GPS track as XML file in g@@ p@@ x format . g@@ ps@@ b@@ abel and g@@ ps@@ man can download and convert the data for you from your GPS device .
image Ge@@ ographical loc@@ alization Cor@@ rel@@ ator . this interface can merge a number of previously selected images with a GPS track .
select the images you want to cor@@ relate in the main window and call the menu . the dialog shown above appears . in order to run a possible correlation between time and location , you need to load a track file with G@@ PX file . of course , this file contains data that were taken at the same locations as the images of your camera .
if the file is loaded an automatic correlation is performed which displays the coordinates in red . GPS trace data are recorded in GMT time and therefore the camera time must be converted to GMT . this can be done with the time zone . place your camera zone here .
the setting for maximum time vari@@ ance indicates an upper devi@@ ation for the GPS time and camera time . if the devi@@ ation is below , the data is merged . the maximum value for this is 2000 seconds .
if you don &apos;t have track data from a location for images , you can manually edit the g@@ p@@ x file and add to the images . the time difference of 2000 seconds will then cor@@ relate all the images in this area .
the options inter@@ pol@@ ate and difference in minutes can be used if you have no matching data . if you know that in reality a location is located in a great time difference between camera and GPS , you can set these limits here and then press the button cor@@ relate to inter@@ pol@@ ate .
the coordinates can be manually set with this dialog . this is useful if you have made a number of photos at the same place . as the dialog is marked by a call to the next you only need to use the OK button to set the data in the current photo .
the location can also be found and set with the displayed map . to do so , select the region in question and increase si@@ e.@@ Per@@ form this again and again until you have reached a sufficient accuracy . the altitude must always be selected manually . the map can be changed between map mode , satellite image and mixed mode .
completely outside the K@@ IP@@ I module there are ways to attach GPS data to the images . here is a small script that uses the ex@@ if@@ tool to provide a stack of images with GPS data .
the K@@ IP@@ I module Photo Gallery is a tool to export a set of albums as HTML pages .
this module can export your albums in a picture gallery from HTML pages to version 4.0@@ 1 . you can select the albums that are to be exported as HTML pages and specify the parameters for the HTML pages . the character set is enco@@ ded UT@@ F @-@ 8 to enable the best internation@@ alization .
the module has four riders in which the settings can be adapted . the tab selection allows you to select all albums that are to be exported to HTML . you just need to select these albums . with the three buttons on the right you can quickly select a large number of albums . in the area below , the Al@@ ben@@ preview and the text that appear in the header of the HTML page will appear .
the tab appearance defines the general appearance and layout for each page . this tab is largely self @-@ explan@@ atory . the option for each image to create a page creates a gallery in which each image will also get its own page . if you then click on a picture a new page will be opened in which the image is displayed . otherwise , the image will be displayed directly with your default image viewer , &amp; eg ; Ku@@ ick@@ show
the tab defines the settings where and how the gallery should be saved with all associated images . for this , select a folder on which you have write permission . a sub @-@ folder named K@@ IP@@ I@@ HTML@@ Output , which contains everything , will be created there .
if you have selected the JPEG file format , the EX@@ IF information of your original pictures will also be saved in the new pictures .
with other color depth you can change the default color depth . of course , it also affects the file size . all other settings are self @-@ explan@@ atory .
the thumb@@ nail image allows you to customize some of the settings from the Album Rider for thumb@@ nails , which are small images that are displayed in the gallery .
a progress window shows the user how far the action is . press Canc@@ el to cancel the process .
if the module has created the pages , the window will not be closed automatically . you can therefore read the program messages to determine if errors occurred during creation . the web browser will automatically start at the end to preview the gallery . press C@@ lose to close the module .
the K@@ IP@@ I viewer is a very fast and flexible Open@@ GL @-@ based tool to view images .
the K@@ IP@@ I viewer allows you to view a selection of images and to carry out basic operations such as turns , zo@@ oming or sliding . the viewer can be used with short commands and mouse buttons . it has been developed for fast image display and quick access to its functions .
after the start , a picture is displayed in full screen mode by default . this can be changed to a window mode .
the K@@ IP@@ I JPEG L@@ oss@@ less module is a tool to change pictures without affecting your quality .
this module allows you to save images in JPEG format for the actions below without the usual loss of quality or metadata .
the consequence of los@@ s@@ less storage is that the file size increases as no compression of the color information takes place . this can be found e.g. in PNG format .
the K@@ IP@@ I module digital camera client is a tool to connect your computer with a digital camera .
the K@@ IP@@ I module digital camera client currently has no documentation . if you are interested in writing them , please contact the mailing list of the K@@ IP@@ I team at k@@ de @-@ imaging @ k@@ de@@ .@@ or@@ g. Please note : the participants of this list speak English .
the K@@ IP@@ I module metadata editor currently has no documentation . if you want to change this situation , please contact the k@@ de @-@ imaging @ k@@ de@@ .org mailing list of the K@@ IP@@ I team .
with the Import function of the metadata module , you can copy data from one image to another . to do so , select the image you want to copy in the main program and then call the Import function . this then opens the file selection dialog with which you want to copy the image to which you want to copy the metadata .
this function does not work with all image formats . you can copy from anywhere , but not write in any target format . JPEG is supported while writing . please look at ex@@ i@@ val to see what formats are supported .
the K@@ IP@@ I MPEG Enco@@ der module is a tool to convert a number of images into a MPEG video in the form of a slide show .
the MPEG encoder module can be used to convert selected images into a MPEG video , with a defined length . this module uses the packages M@@ jp@@ eg@@ Tools and Ima@@ ge@@ Mag@@ ick . you can also add a basic image transition between the individual images . you can also add an audio file in the MP@@ 2 or WAV of the slide au .
all images are automatically sc@@ aled to the correct size for the selected video format . in addition , you can select a background color for the slide show . with this module it is possible to create DVD / X@@ VCD / SV@@ CD / VCD for your DVD Player . for burning the medium , you can finally use the K@@ 3@@ b program .
first you need to select the images they want to be packed into the MPEG sli@@ deshow . after that , you can create the module via Extras MPEG Sli@@ deshow .
the images you have selected are then listed in the Portfolio . you can also change the images or the contents of the list there .
after you are satisfied with your list , you should adjust the other settings . the video format can be selected from various formats , DVD , X@@ VCD , SV@@ CD and VCD . if you are planning to play the file on a TV , you need to select the appropriate TV standard PAL , SE@@ CAM or NT@@ SC . PAL is pres@@ et and most likely the right choice for Europe .
in the next step , you should indicate the time in seconds that will display a picture . the speed of the image transition is specified below . a low value creates very sudden , a high , very smooth image change .
the background color can be adjusted next . in case of doubt , you should let them black . you can specify the name and path of the created file using the name of the MPEG output file .
if you specify an audio file under the name of the audio source file , it will be integrated into the movie . after you have adapted all settings to your wishes , you can start the creation of the movie with the encoding button . depending on the speed of your computer , you can now enjoy a coffee and enjoy the sli@@ deshow if you are back .
if a suggestion appears that enco@@ ders or tools are missing , you can customize the paths to the programs of the jp@@ eg@@ s and Ima@@ ge@@ Mag@@ ick packages on the right @-@ hand button .
the job super@@ visor allows you to print several images on a sheet of paper together in standard phot@@ og@@ gers . the combined images can also be automatically opened using the image processing g@@ im@@ p . this is e.@@ g : useful to improve you or print directly with the Gim@@ p module .
with this K@@ IP@@ I module , you can import or convert your images stored in RAW format into one of three formats JPEG , TIFF or PP@@ M .
the conversion is based on the command @-@ line tool d@@ cra@@ w of Dave Coff@@ in . an original quote from him is : do not expect d@@ cra@@ w to produce the same results as the software from your camera manufacturer . sometimes you get better results with d@@ cra@@ w ! .
first select the RAW file to be converted and start the module . the Ra@@ w Image Converter windows then appears in the mode for a single image . with the Preview Preview you can view the effect of your current settings on the image .
you can now re @-@ adjust the values to optimize the conversion process . the first option determines whether the camera settings should be used for the white balance . the key parameters such as g@@ amma , brightness and red / blue ampli@@ fiers can be adjusted . if the result is not optimal you can edit the image later .
a four @-@ colour R@@ G@@ BG conversion can be selected so that you can use the contrast information . if your camera works in RGB mode , the R@@ G@@ BG switch has no effect .
once you are satisfied with the preview , you can choose one of the three output formats and save the conversion result . the file name stays the same and only the extension will be adjusted accordingly . JPEG util@@ ises a los@@ sy algorithm and produces the smallest file sizes for it .
the Tagged Image Format , TIFF , re@@ tains all information of your image and uses the los@@ s@@ less L@@ Z@@ W compression .
if you plan to edit your pictures frequently or you later use it further , you should not choose JPEG format because it only allows a limited number of operations before the image quality deteri@@ or@@ ates . TIFF and PP@@ M are better adapted to keep the original data .
if you choose JPEG as a storage format , the metadata that is contained in the RAW file is stored in the JPEG file in the ex@@ if information .
if you have adapted your settings , you can start conversion with the trigger button . if you want to cancel this process again , you can use Canc@@ el .
batch processing mode allows you to convert different images at one time . use this mode if you are certain , e.g. by testing a single image , which are the best settings .
the available settings are almost identical to the version for single images . however , you have the possibility to over@@ write existing file automatically . this is helpful if these were created in an earlier attempt . however , a preview is not available . the progress bar shows how far the conversion has progres@@ sed .
this module can be used to comp@@ ress all the images in an album . it uses the program convert from the Ima@@ ge@@ Mag@@ ick package . the following image formats are supported :
this module can be used to ren@@ ame all images of an album . you can set the pre@@ fix , the start number and the tim@@ est@@ amp of the album .
this module can be used to change the size of several images of an image collection . it uses the convert program from the Ima@@ ge@@ Mag@@ ick package . you can reduce or enlarge the image . for this purpose four types of image changes are provided :
proportional ( 1 D@@ im . ) : normal size change in one dimension . the width or height of the image is selected automatically , depending on image orientation , and the aspect ratio remains unchanged .
proportional ( 2 D@@ im . ) : change of size in two dimensions . here , the aspect ratio remains unchanged . you can use this option e.g. to adjust your image to the screen format .
not proportional : not proportional size change in two dimensions . the aspect ratio is changed with this option .
pre @-@ treatment : prepare the image for the photo print . the user can adjust the print resolution and the size of the photo paper . the target image , including background size , edge size and background color , will be adjusted accordingly .
with this K@@ IP@@ I module you can send selected pictures with your preferred e @-@ mail program . it is also possible to change the size of the images to be sent before .
after you have started the module , the image window will appear with the images selected by you . you can add more images via the Add button . for the last selected image you will see a preview on the right .
you can also drag and drop images to the images list to add them to the list of images to be sent .
the selected images will be removed from the list of images to be sent by using the Pictures button .
after you have selected all the images , you can open the new message window of your email client with the OK button . you only have to add the addresses and the subject . the pictures selected by you are attached as attachments .
make sure not to send too many pictures at one time . most email accounts have limitations for the size of emails sent . it may be a good idea to send several mails if you want to send many pictures .
the e @-@ mail window is used to change the settings for sending the images . your configuration is stored and used every time until you change it .
select your e @-@ mail client from the menu . if you select Thunder@@ bird , you will need to specify the correct path for your installation in the input field below .
if you use the Google Mail service , you must first install the G@@ mail Agent on your computer . you can download it here .
after selecting comments in a attached file , the comments to the images are added to a text file and sent to the mail .
the PNG format in the File Format menu is not very suitable to reduce the size of photo files , but it is best adapted to los@@ s@@ less formats such as TIFF . you should therefore use PNG if you have a fast internet connection and the photo quality should not be changed . otherwise we recommend you the JPEG format .
if you select JPEG under Pictures file format and the original files in JPEG format , then the original ex@@ if@@ data will be added to the images to be sent .
when the process is finished , the window will not automatically closed so you can view the status messages , in search of errors . your e @-@ mail program will be started automatically at the end . with the closing button you can close this window .
after starting the Advanced Di@@ asch@@ au module , a window with questions like you would like to have displayed your sli@@ deshow appears . you can choose between the selected and all images of the album .
the option Open@@ GL transi@@ tions in the presentation use very elegant image transi@@ tions using Open@@ GL . however , you must have a corresponding graphic card , otherwise the slide show will be very slow .
the fil@@ ename option ensures that the fil@@ ename of the images will appear in the lower left corner during presentation .
the loop option ensures that the presentation will be displayed in a loop . you can then manually cancel it with Es@@ c .
the images random@@ ly select make sure that the images are displayed in a random order . so it is not the order of the pictures used in the album .
with a delay between the pictures the temporal distance between the individual images can be set . 1500 mill@@ is@@ ec@@ onds correspond to 1.5 seconds and are a good default value . however , the best distance depends on your computer and the selected transition effect . so you should test this before you show your friends !
there are more than a dozen transi@@ tional effects between which you can choose . random@@ ly , each transition between the pictures sel@@ ects a different effect .
during the slide show , you can access a tool@@ bar at the top left of the screen . move the mouse to this corner to turn on .
with this tool bar you can stop and restart the presentation , jump to the previous and next image and stop slide show .
at the bottom of the screen you can see the current fil@@ ename , the position of the current image and the total number of images in your presentation .
the K@@ IP@@ I module Time &amp; Date has no documentation yet . if you are interested in writing them , please contact the mailing list of the K@@ IP@@ I team at k@@ de @-@ imaging @ k@@ de@@ .@@ or@@ g. Please note : the participants of this list speak English .
the K@@ IP@@ I module background image is a tool to set a picture as background image for the work surface .
this module sets the currently selected image , depending on the selected option of the sub@@ menu , as background for your K@@ DE desktop .
as soon as you have ann@@ ot@@ ated your pictures and videos with comments , you can get with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; through these brow@@ ses , see picture . as you can see by comparison with the image , there are now in each group , i.e. people , places and in group keywords entries .
in the browser window you can see the categories for which you have entered information when you have provided your images and videos with notes . additionally , there are entries to look for EX@@ IF @-@ based information , view the folder structure on your hard drive and of course view the current thumb@@ nails .
when you press the mouse on the entry , the browser &apos;s view changes . see image .
when you select another person , only the images on which both persons are shown are shown . by this selection method , you can restrict the number of displayed images from a few thousand images to a few single images .
if you have selected all people , locations and other settings , you can view thumb@@ nails to view the pictures of your sphere of action .
in the picture , each person has the same symbol before their name . you can use &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; but for each person you can save your own thumb@@ nail , which also applies to places , keywords and other categories you have defined yourself . see the picture for this .
to view images next to the names , select the button on the right of the tool@@ bar . in the pop @-@ up context menu , you can select which view you want to use for the current category . this has the advantage that you can display symbols with images of persons and at the same time a list of keywords ( if you do not have suitable images for your keywords ) .
however , you need to select which image to be displayed for each individual person . to do this , you will need to open the picture pane window ( described in more detail ) and select the categories editor in the context menu . here you can customize the image for the respective person . in the check @-@ in window , you can adjust the magni@@ fication factor according to your wishes and thus select which part of the image is to be displayed or cut .
when you look for the entry in the main window , you will see a dialog that is very similar to the dialog for setting the image properties . you can preview this dialog once again .
if you enter a string in the lab@@ eling or description field , the descriptions or descriptions of the images will be searched for this text . if you want , you can also enter a date to search for ; the date can either be a part of the total dat@@ as , e.g. 1971 , or the complete date . you can also use a section of two dates , such as 1971 @-@ 1980 .
with the options in the lower part of the window , you can browse all images according to specific names , as you can see in the picture . here , according to pictures Jes@@ per , but not Anne Hel@@ ene are depicted .
this is the user manual for &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; if you don &apos;t like to read manuals , but rather want to try the same functions , you have the following alternatives to this manual :
go to the homepage of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; and watch the Quick Start , the scre@@ en@@ shots and the introduc@@ tions videos .
start &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; and in the first dialog , select the demo if you start &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; start the first time , or select the menu entry c@@ photo@@ album ; demo . then some sample images will be loaded and you can try the functions of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; try .
if you prefer to print this manual you will find it on the homepage of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; as a coher@@ ent HTML document to download .
at the bottom of the main window of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; see the tim@@ eline . a picture of this bar you can see here : . as the name suggests , this bar shows you date statistics on the pictures in your database .
the tim@@ eline can display several different time units . each bar then displays another unit . you can switch between units years , months , weeks , hours and 10 minutes . on the picture you can see a part of a database by showing the bar only 10 @-@ minute sections .
the tim@@ eline can be used inter@@ actively in the following ways : you can change the displayed entries thumb@@ nail from the database ( if you select a date , the first image of this date will appear in the preview window ) and the time bar always displays the current date of the currently displayed images , if you navigate in the preview view .
you can also select a range of tim@@ eline by holding down the mouse button and drag@@ ging the mouse over the ruler of the tim@@ eline , i.e. the tim@@ est@@ amps . if you select a range , you will only display images of this time in the preview view . you can cancel the selection by clicking on a tim@@ eline bar .
&amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; provides you two ways to create HTML websites with your pictures . one is in &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; integrated and the other available as a module ( see ) . in the following part of the user manual , the in &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; integrated version , which you can create through the menu File HTML ...
before creating HTML pages you need to make some settings . these are divided into the three areas of Content , Layout and Ob@@ jective . in the following each area is described more accurately .
first , enter the title of the overview and a description that the HTML file should contain later . on k@@ photo@@ album ; HTML example pages see an example of these settings .
next , select whether a &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; export file is to be created , which is to be seen on the overview page . more information on export files can be found in .
finally , you can select which information to display on the HTML pages . this allows you to avoid that information is displayed to the viewer even without a description . for example , that all pictures are of a party . note that &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; therefore , you cannot use this setting to hide certain images from certain viewers .
in this section you can specify how the HTML pages should look like . most settings are clear , which is why this is not addressed specifically .
at the bottom of the page you can set different resolutions for the pictures . this means those who view your website and have a monitor that supports the maximum resolution 800@@ x@@ 600 , no more images that have a resolution of 1600@@ x@@ 1200 for example .
the viewers of your site can change the resolution at any time you specified . so , you can browse your images with low resolution , which leads to a smaller transmission time . if he wants to get a picture bigger , it changes to a higher resolution .
in this Settings section you specify the different folders and the URL where your site is stored .
the best way to select a base folder for all your HTML files and a new sub@@ folder for each subsequent set .
first you need to select the main folder where all your images are stored . this folder will be saved and added automatically next time . this allows you to select the location for all future images . here you can choose either a folder or a K@@ DE supported protocol , for example :
after creating your images , you can check if they really are all visible to viewers . if you choose a URL for the base folder , a web browser will start after the pages have been created . otherwise , the URL you set here should be the folder . otherwise , the web browser will start in the wrong folder .
if the HTML files created by you are not yet in the final destination folder , you will have to copy them to it manually . to enable the import function , see , properly , you must specify the final destination of the files . this is not the sub@@ folder of the current files , but the base folder where all sub@@ folders are located .
the settings you have just described have related all three to base folders and URLs . in these , a sub@@ folder is created , whose name you specify in the output folder .
if you are on a family celebration , a meeting in the company , a conference or somewhere else , with other users of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; you may , of course , create an HTML page to view the images . however , if you have spent a lot of time applying the picture information , persons on the pictures , recording location , etc . , then you have to do with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; this work will not do again .
with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; you can export a copy of your images into a .@@ k@@ im file . these can import others into your database .
there are two different types of .@@ k@@ im files , internal and external . they differ in whether the images themselves are stored in the file or if in the file there is only one link to images . the advantage of all images in the file is that you can have all the pictures together and that this file can be shared as independent . however , the obvious disadvantage is the file size .
you can either export a .@@ k@@ im file directly from the Export menu ... or together with HTML pages , see , create . if you create a .@@ k@@ im file along with an HTML file , this will be an external .@@ k@@ im file .
an external .@@ k@@ im file searches the images in two ways . first , it searches the images that are in the file of the .@@ k@@ im file . if the corresponding pictures are not found , then the images of the URL you specified when creating the HTML files will be searched . this is of course only possible if you created your .@@ k@@ im file using HTML export .
the following will describe the dialog for exp@@ orting images , which you can view through the Export menu .
the most important option of this dialog is whether it should be internal or external .@@ k@@ im files . the following three choices are available :
when you copy manuals to the .@@ k@@ im file , you have to copy the images to the same folder as the .@@ k@@ im file .
with the Automati@@ cally move to .@@ k@@ im file copy &amp; photo@@ album ; the pictures automatically for you .
.@@ k@@ im files are normal zi@@ pped files . since most of the images have already been compressed with JPEG , and the XML file itself is very small , it is usually not worthwhile to comp@@ ress the files . if you want this , simply select the Export file .
the last option of this page is Maximum image size . if you send pictures to your friends , you might not want to send the pictures in full size , as the .@@ k@@ im file would otherwise be very large . for example , you can limit the size by saying that each image should be at most 800 pixels high and wide .
if you import a file with the extension .@@ k@@ im from the web browser or from the File menu item ... select , becomes &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; the exported database as described in described .
the assistant to import consists of four steps . first , you need to select which images you want to import , then in which folders the import images are to be copied .
it may be that you specify the category of people of the imported file ( if you are a domain ) , while this category is named by your database . therefore , in the third dialog box , you will be asked which categories of the imported file to import , and which categories will match them in your database .
in the fourth step , you can compare the categories of the file to be imported using the categories of your current database . for example , see the image .
it just has to be easy to browse and view pictures : if you look at pictures , you often want to jump within different picture groups &amp; m@@ d@@ ash ; for example , if you look at pictures of your Italy holiday and discover a picture with your friend , you might want to see all the pictures on which this friend is depicted .
in this manual you will go through the different steps from ( 1 ) Speci@@ fying information about your images , over ( 2 ) browsing and viewing , up to ( 3 ) advanced themes and custom@@ ization options .
K@@ Photo@@ Album has been started as a program to manage your pictures , but it has been extended and today it also takes care of your videos . in many places in this manual you talk about pictures , but often this also includes videos .
&amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; stores all its information in the file index@@ .x@@ ml in the top folder of its images . it is a simple XML file that you can backup with a program of your choice , e.g. Nor@@ mal backup tools , copy to a disk or re@@ visions in the CV@@ S , where they want .
&amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; records the folder where your pictures are stored and automatically re @-@ use it in future starts . if you want to read another database in &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; you can start &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; with the -@@ c option . as an example : k@@ photo@@ album -@@ c ~ / company / images / index@@ .x@@ ml .
through the menu entry Settings k@@ photo@@ album ; set up ... you can get to a window with which you can change the settings of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; in the following section of the user manual , you will find the different settings options .
on the left you can see six different symbols with which you can view settings of the preview and the options for the viewer . for each setting , a detailed help is available , which you can use by pressing a button on the F1 key and clicking on the desired option .
we have described how to set different properties for each image , e.g. people , places and keywords . you can also create your own groups such as objects , animals or albums .
see the dialog used to edit existing groups . for each group you can select a label and a symbol .
in the section sub@@ categories have already been mentioned . in the Options dialog , you can set up complete membership groups , i.e. all members of a group at once in a group , instead of explaining all groups of a member as explained in .
in the list box above , you can select the category you want to configure . in the left side of the window you can select the category you want to configure . in the left part of the window you can find a list of the categories and in the right a list of sub@@ categories .
&amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; shares its modular system with other graphic applications , such as digi@@ p@@ am and G@@ wen@@ view . this module system is called K@@ IP@@ I and means &amp; k@@ de ; Image Plugin interface . next information can be found on the website of Ki@@ pi .
the modules can be called via the menu modules . the modules can and are not described in this manual , since they are not part of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; however , most modules have a help page , which you can access via the module itself .
since the modules of several applications are shared among each other , it may be that the modules were tested with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; therefore , you should always first test new modules using the demo database before using them to your own pictures . the demo database can be used either via the command line with the command &gt; k@@ photo@@ album demo &lt; us@@ er@@ input \ &gt; or through the Help menu . don &apos;t tell me I didn &apos;t warn you !
the applications that the modules use together with K@@ IP@@ I are very different , making it possible that some modules with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album do not work . this is the disadvantage if you share functions with different applications .
the biggest difference between &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; and other applications , which also use K@@ IP@@ I , is that the other applications can arrange their pictures in albums : even if &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; this type of order does not support , it simul@@ ates the order for albums so you can use the functions with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album .
this simul@@ ates and k@@ photo@@ album ; the current album , which simply corresponds to the current view , so all the pictures that show you the picture preview at the moment .
next to the current album has to be released &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; the modules also have a list of albums . here goes &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; as follows :
if &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; s browser shows the content of a category , e.g. all persons , then each entry of this category represents an album for the module .
or it will use the category you set in the Settings dialog as a category for virtual albums . so , for example , if you are using the category people , you will do so , so whether you have selected persons to view and pass it on to the module .
since some modules with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; not compatible , you can remove them from the list of modules . to do so , start the setup dialog and select in the module section which modules should be loaded .
on the picture you can see an example of a start screen as soon as you &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; start with your own pictures .
as you are used to any other K@@ DE application , you will see a menu and tool@@ bar at the top . at the moment , you can see the window with which you can browse your image database . currently , it does not contain very much information , as you do not yet have any information about your pictures . in the section we will click on the picture to show you an overview of all existing pictures .
one of the main functions of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; it is possible to ann@@ ot@@ ate any picture with notes . this includes information about the persons shown on the picture , where the image was taken , etc . you can either set each image individually or for a larger number of pictures at the same time . if for example , illustrated on all pictures Jes@@ per and all pictures taken in Copenhagen .
all of these notes can be used for searching and browsing , as you can read in the section . if you want you can see these remarks by using the built @-@ in viewer .
you can see three lists with a text field by setting people , locations and keywords . these are a very important part of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; since you will always use it again when you enter information about your pictures .
the following idea is based on shifting the images within the list : for example , if you have a family celebration and on all 50 pictures the same 5 @-@ 10 people are depicted , you can , therefore , that the names used are moved up to find and assign people more quickly .
if you prefer to get an alphabe@@ tically sorted list , click the S@@ ort by date on the list .
if you have selected notes for each image individually , you may wish to edit all the selected images and add them to the images . in this case , simply click on the front and back buttons that are under the thumb@@ nail of the image to the top right .
if you have recorded several pictures , e.g. with the same person , then it can be more convenient to mark all these pictures and to use the menu item Sever@@ al entries at once with a note .
Las Vegas , San Francisco , Los Angeles and California are all located in the USA . in addition , San Francisco and Los Angeles are in California .
on the picture you will see a browser window that shows the USA as a group . to show you that it is a super group , a special icon is displayed .
in the Not@@ ation dialog context menu , it is possible to add an entry to an existing or new type or sub@@ category . in addition , you can also drag an entry to a category and place it there to make it an sub@@ category of this entry .
you can move the individual elements of the note dialog by clicking and moving the l@@ ath that form the upper edge of the frame . you can also make a separate window from a frame by drag@@ ging it outside the window area .
if you have adapted the appearance of the window to your needs so that you are satisfied with the settings , click the Options ... button , which will allow you to save the current setup and appearance of the window .
you can also hide a frame completely . if you want to get this window displayed later , use the Options ... and then close the window . see this procedure in the picture .
if you select the entry in the browser , you will get an overview of preview images of the currently selected images , or any pictures if you do not set a filter . for example , see here . you can configure the size of thumb@@ nails by simply drag@@ ging the mouse with the middle mouse button .
if you drop a picture on the background of your desktop , this image will be set as background image for your desktop .
if you click on a picture , it will appear in the picture viewer . if you have not yet opened a window with an image viewer , a new display window will be created .
you can also delete pictures in the image preview . simply select the corresponding images you want to delete and press either the Rem@@ ove button or select Del@@ ete from the Edit menu . now , the window will appear to you , which you can see in the picture .
&amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; offers you a solution for this problem . you can use with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; namely , you may have the images stored somewhere to get &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; you can view the view from &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; in the picture you can see the view from &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; if not all required pictures can be downloaded from the hard drive .
images in which the upper right corner is cut off are not saved on the hard drive . however , for the pictures 5 @-@ 9 , the thumb@@ nails are present , so that &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; you can view the preview of these pictures too . however , you can &apos;t view these pictures using the picture viewer .
as you see , this feature requires you to extract files from the folders and copy them back . &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; so far , do not support the insertion of the respective CD . so if you want trouble , how to avoid confusion of your pictures , please buy a larger disk to store all the images on it .
in the View menu , you will find a sub @-@ menu with the name privacy . if you want to have a little more privacy , filter the pictures so that at the end those who want to make you in@@ accessible for others and click on Current View in the menu Privacy . alternatively , you can also control all the images that your little sister may see , and select the menu item Any@@ thing besides current view .
this allows you to specify which pictures should be hidden in the case of the case . if you give the laptop to your little sister , simply select the Add Images , whereby all the images you have blocked have to be hidden . if you want to get the pictures shown again , click on the lock .
it is also possible to specify a password that needs to be entered to unlock the images . to set up this password , simply change the password in the Privacy menu .
please bear in mind that this picture protection is by no means very safe . on the one hand , all images on the hard disk and on the other hand , anyone who can access the file index@@ .x@@ ml can only read or delete the password as un@@ encrypted text . this type of password protection is only for those who are familiar with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; not very familiar to forbi@@ d the look of private pictures .
the reason you all of your pictures with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; manage and spend hours over hours with it is natural that you want to look at them some@@ time . for this reason , &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; about a picture _ and video viewer . this can be started from the preview as described in .
you can see the viewer in the picture . of course , it displays the image , but additional information you have to enter via the image , such as who is on the picture , when and where was it made , etc .
if the info@@ box on the upper part of the image you want to see , you can simply drag it with the mouse and put it somewhere else . you can also configure what information is displayed and if any information is displayed . all these options are available on the viewer after a right click .
some words in the info@@ box are under@@ lined . if you click here the browser , see the appropriate entries to this . if you click on Anne Hel@@ ene , the browser will show you all the pictures of Anne Hel@@ ene . as if you had selected persons from the browser and then Anne Hel@@ ene .
if you have uploaded several images in the viewer , you can switch between them before and back by using the buttons picture high and picture . you can jump to the first and last picture with pos@@ 1 and end . these functions are also accessible from the context menu .
if several images are loaded in the viewer , you can run them as slides . &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; then load a new image after a few seconds . how often it loads a new image can be controlled by pressing the C@@ trl key and plus or minus .
a very useful feature of the viewer from &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; is it possible to switch to full screen mode . in this mode , the viewer uses the complete space on the screen . simply use the input key to switch to full screen mode and back .
when you use the viewer you can zoom in and zoom out . to zoom in , you can just pull out a rect@@ angle with the mouse . with the minus button , you can zoom out again The Plus button zo@@ oms in the middle of the image . shows how a zoom ro@@ eck is selected and shows the result of the zoom .
with the point button , you can reset your zoom , so that the image will not be zo@@ omed . with the control key you zoom the zoom , so that every pixel on the screen corresponds to a pixel of the image .
note that the only zo@@ om@@ operations that work with videos show that they are in and out with the plus and minus keys .
with the turning functions from the context menu , you can rotate the image . this does not work with videos . you can make notes to the current image with the menu item notes from the context menu .
when you look at pictures it may happen that you will find a picture with a person whose name you forgot to put on the image . in the moment you can preview the image and open the configuration dialog of the image to enter these names . however , you might prefer to mark only the image and see more pictures .
another situation is that you want to send a number of images to a printer to get the pictures developed on paper . to see which photos you want you can start the viewer with the pictures and mark them as good or poor@@ ly while you look one by one .
for the two examples above , the viewer gives you the possibility to provide pictures with features while viewing them . features are the letters A to Z and you can set a feature by clicking the corresponding letter . in this picture you can see an image where the characters A , B and C are set .
as soon as you have set features on your pictures , they are available to you in the browser . so , if you have all the images you edit , print or whatever you have selected , just add them all at once with notes . this is described in . then you can use a module to copy the selected images to a CD or whatever you want to do right .
categories and special features can be shown in the preview screen . if you can view categories in the preview view , you can add features to the images by simply pressing the character for the feature after the image was selected . you can see this here :
sometimes it is not clear what you want to show on a picture . in this case , you allow you &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; to paint on the picture .
the mixture is not saved with the image , but in the database . in this way you can und@@ o your painted later .
to turn off the painting mode of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; turn on the image from the contex@@ tual menu . to finish the painting simply press the cross in the tool@@ bar at the top of the window .
to work with &amp; k@@ rep@@ v@@ model@@ er ; you need to use the program &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; not fully control , but the documentation to &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; should you absolutely read and understand .
in the object tree you can select individual objects . then their properties are displayed in the object properties and the object in the wire model views is shown yellow .
you can also select multiple objects at the same time , but not the sub@@ object of an object that has already been selected , since all the objects are already selected with the object .
to insert a new object in the object tree , select the position where you want to insert the object and either click on the icon in the tool@@ bar or select a menu entry in the Insert menu .
if there are multiple possible positions , the following drop @-@ down menu is displayed to enable you to select the correct position :
del@@ eting either from the menu bar under Edit or from the right mouse button context menu , you can remove previously selected objects from the scene .
if you have changed properties , click Apply to apply these changes . if you have entered invalid values , a message will be displayed with an error message . then you can correct the input errors and click on Apply , or disc@@ ard the changes with Canc@@ el .
if you enter the path to &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; -@@ user documentation in the setup dialog , you can call the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; -@@ reference to the displayed object with help .
you need the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; 3.@@ 1@@ g or 3.5 H@@ MT@@ L user documentation to use this feature . if this documentation is not included in your distribution , you can download it here . &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; 3.5 already contains the user documentation .
if you edit a texture or part of a texture , you can see a preview in the property view .
press Preview in the Properties Tab and a small sample of the scene is rendered with the selected texture . as default , the whole texture is rendered , even if you want to render a sub@@ set item ( for example , a texture within a texture map and not the entire texture map ) , check locally .
the scre@@ enshot shows the control points of the camera . you can drag these control points with the mouse button and change the position and direction of the camera .
when a transformation is selected , the check@@ points disappear and a small cross is displayed in the wi@@ re@@ model view . this cross marks the center for sc@@ aling and rotation as well as the position for shifts . you can change the shift by drag@@ ging with the mouse within the entire window .
each object has a visibility level as a wire model . you can specify this value relative to the visibility level of the parent object or as absolute value . Objects are only displayed when they are selected or their visibility level is smaller or equal to the visibility level chosen in the tool@@ bar .
&amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; has a window arrangement as default . the object tree and the view of the object properties are shown on the left and the four graphic views on the right .
if you don &apos;t like the standard window arrangement or if you need a different arrangement , you can adjust it arbit@@ rar@@ ily . you can also save several window orders and simply switch between different arrangements .
to anchor a window above or below a view , drag the beginning to the top or bottom of a view . a rect@@ angle then displays the new position .
to create a new column , drag the beginning to the right or left side of a view . the new view is then anch@@ ored on the right or left side of this view and extends over the entire height .
if you want to arrange multiple views over each other , drag the beginner in the middle of a different view . you can then switch between the views by clicking on the map icon in the top of the views .
the last possible window arrangement are floating views : views that are not anch@@ ored in the main window . to solve a view from the anch@@ oring , drag the author to the desktop or click on the small arrow pointing left at the beginning bar .
to close a view click on the small cross at the beginning bar . to prevent the closing , click on the small square between the arrow and the cross .
you can insert additional views in the main window . in the View menu you will find entries for each type of views . new views are floating , you can anchor it anywhere .
the current window view can be saved with View window order ... saving . a dialog appears where you can save the window arrangement under an existing or new name .
if you have created a scene , you can render it . &amp; k@@ rep@@ v@@ model@@ er ; used &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; 3.@@ 1@@ g to render , this program must be properly installed . as this manual was written , &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; 3.5 currently . this version is not supported in &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; version 1.0 .
to render the current scene , click the Ren@@ dering icon in the tool@@ bar or select the Ren@@ dering menu item .
a render mode corresponds to entries in &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; s ini files . it determines the image size and quality of rendering . if you want to render a scene in different frame sizes and quality levels , you can insert as many render modes , from a quick preview to full images of the highest quality .
if you click on the render settings icon in the tool@@ bar or in the View menu of R@@ ender Mo@@ di ... select the following dialog :
each render mode has a name . you can enter any name , but it makes sense a name that lets you recognize the properties of the mode .
in the card size you can enter the width and height of the rendered image . if you only want to render a small area of the image , select the check box section and enter the picture cut to render into the input fields .
in the Quality combination field you can select the properties , the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; used for rendering . this goes from a very simple color and light model to a model with complex @-@ diff@@ use reflection lighting . a detailed description of the render features can be found in the user manual on &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; .
if a picture is rendered with only one beam each pixel , different errors can occur . these images often have a Mo@@ ir@@ è pattern or step effects in curves and lines , in addition , details are sometimes not displayed if they are smaller than a pixel . this effect is called ali@@ asing .
&amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; uses a technique called anti @-@ ali@@ asing to reduce the influence of these errors . generally , pictures with this property look better .
when you turn on anti @-@ ali@@ asing , calcul@@ ates and connects &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; more than one ray per pixel . this technique is super @-@ sampling .
&amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; supports two methods of super @-@ sampling . as a standard is an adaptive , non @-@ recur@@ sive method ; adap@@ tively because the super @-@ sampling contains the neighboring pixel . the second method is adaptive @-@ recur@@ sive ; recur@@ sive because each pixel is further divided and adapted because the recur@@ sion depth depends on the calculated colours .
if you select the first method , POV @-@ Ray pursu@@ es a beam of each pixel . if the difference between the colored values exceeds the given threshold , then both pixels are calculated by tracking a specific additional number of pixels with super @-@ sampling . if you set the depth to 4 , a grid of 4x4 additional points will be calculated , with a depth of 5 then 5x@@ 5 ( 25 ) additional rays per pixel .
the difference between two pixels is calculated as follows : R 1 , g 1 and b 1 are the values for red , green and blue of the first pixel , r 2 , g 2 and b 2 are the values for red , green and blue of the second pixel . the difference then amounts to :
diff = abs ( r 1 -@@ r 2 ) + abs ( g 1 -@@ g 2 ) + abs ( b 1 -@@ b 2 )
the recur@@ sive method starts with 4 beams per pixel . if the difference between the colors exceeds the given threshold , then the pixel is divided into 4 sub @-@ pixels , which are individually followed and checked for further sub@@ division . you can adjust the maximum depth of the recur@@ sion with the depth value .
another way to reduce the ali@@ asing effect is the creation of noise for the beam process called J@@ itter@@ ing . if you turn on j@@ itter@@ ing , changed &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; the rays to avoid a tiny amount to avoid regular patterns .
the last setting for quality of rendering is diff@@ use reflection . this is an experimental feature of &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; which calcul@@ ates diff@@ use light reflection . it takes a very long time to calculate a scene with this property .
on this map you can set whether the alpha channels should be calculated by POV @-@ Ray . a pixel is then transparent if the corresponding beams have no object .
opens a new window for displaying &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; console output . if &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; un@@ expect@@ edly termin@@ ated , you can find the reason here .
to import a &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; scene , select the menu item Import ... and select a file in the dialog box .
currently supports &amp; k@@ rep@@ v@@ model@@ er ; not yet the full range of commands from &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; if error messages or warnings appear when import@@ ing , a dialog box displays a list of all messages .
if you do not want to support source text in &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; want to import , write this code between the two particular comments / / * PM@@ Ra@@ w@@ Beg@@ in and / / * PM@@ Ra@@ w@@ End .
you can drag objects from the object tree to the editor to export the source for &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray . this adds to the source code of the object in the open text file in the editor . to import objects into the scene , simply select the source code in the editor and drag it into the object tree .
with copy and paste into &amp; k@@ rep@@ v@@ model@@ er ; and in your editor you can add source for &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; also insert .
the POV @-@ Ray command is called when &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; a scene ren@@ ders . usually this is po@@ v@@ ray or x @-@ po@@ v@@ ray .
if you click on Help in the property view , open &amp; k@@ rep@@ v@@ model@@ er ; the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; user documentation to the displayed object . here , set the path to your document retention and version . supported are 3.@@ 1@@ g and 3.5 .
&amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; search for external files ( for example height field data ) in paths to &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; libraries . if you include files that are not in the folder of the scene , you also need to add the path to these files here . if a file is found in different paths of the library , the first found file is used .
the color for the wire models . the second color is used for displaying the selected objects .
the color for the check@@ points . the second color is used for displaying the selected check@@ points .
the color of the rect@@ angle for the field of view in the camera view and in the window type license plates .
you can set the object catch of the points on the grid in the context menu of the wi@@ re@@ model views . here you can set the grid separately for shifts , scales and turns .
larger values result in a more accurate wire model and therefore a better approxim@@ ation for the displayed objects , but require more time for rendering . for some objects such as the sphere you can set the detail level separately for two directions .
if you tick high attention to extended projec@@ tions , all wire model views will be further divided if the camera uses an extended projection . advanced projec@@ tions are all projec@@ tions with exceptions to the perspective and vertical projec@@ tions . this feature gives a better approach to projec@@ tions , but requires more time to render .
when you cross a wall , a wall behind the objects is rendered . the wall is represented in a ch@@ ess@@ board pattern made of two adjustable colours .
when you cross the floor , a floor underneath the objects is rendered . the floor is displayed in a ch@@ ess@@ board pattern made of two adjustable colours .
if you tick edge smooth@@ ing , the non @-@ recur@@ sive anti @-@ ali@@ asing method is used for rendering the scenes . you can set the values for depth and threshold value . see the R@@ ender @-@ Mo@@ di section for more details on the parameters .
on this page you can change existing window orders or create new window orders . in the window orders section you will explain how you can create and store window orders .
the Com@@ bin@@ ation Field Def@@ ault window arrangement : displays all existing window orders . &amp; k@@ rep@@ v@@ model@@ er ; uses the selected window arrangement when starting the program .
the list of window orders present shows all existing window orders . a new arrangement can be created with the Add button and delete a select arrangement with the Del@@ ete button .
each window order is identified by the name . the name must be unique and must not be empty .
the list below the name shows all views for the selected window arrangement . new views can be created using the Add button and del@@ eting selected views with the Del@@ ete button .
the position of the new window . with new column you create a new column on the right side of the existing windows , with gates you anchor the window under the existing window , with card card you get a map sheet view together with the previous view and floating anch@@ ored the view not in the main window , but creates a separate window .
so you just have &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; and &amp; k@@ rep@@ v@@ model@@ er ; installed and now you want to start without a more detailed knowledge of the two programs . if you follow all steps in this guide , you should be able to create the ultimate but simple scene , among beginners very popular : a sphere on one level .
but you should carefully consider the following warnings before you complain that you only get a black screen as a result . if you use a 3D program for the first time , you should consider these important rules :
if you don &apos;t set a camera , no rules can be applied to rendering , as a result you will get a black picture .
if you do not insert light sources , your whole scene is in the dark and you get only a black picture .
if you have installed everything error @-@ free , see the first start of &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; the following pre @-@ set window arrangement :
take a little time to get to know the menus and the symbols of the tool@@ bar . please read the documentation to get an appropriate idea of what you can expect from this program .
you will need to use these menus and symbols frequently so you should remember the menus and symbols and their application .
&amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; start with a simple scene . to follow this guide , you first need to remove all objects from the object tree . select the scene and then select Edit Del@@ ete . so you now have a scene without objects .
the wire model view shows how the camera looks at the whole scene you produce . in particular , you notice that in the fourth wire model view ( right below ) . this is the view of the scene from the perspective of the camera . this shows you the result of the rendering of the scene .
the object tree now contains a new entry with the name camera . if you click on it , you can see the contents of the object properties in which the various parameters of the camera can be found . in the user documentation to &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; see for more details .
do not change the basic settings of the camera , this is reserved for later instructions , but note that the camera has control points in the view that you can change the target point of the camera . simply click with the left mouse button on a control point and drag it to the desired location .
when you press the Apply button or the Enter key , the wi@@ re@@ model views and the object tree change immediately in accordance with these settings . as a result , they see the scene from the view@@ point of the camera .
there are many ways to create the ground for the scene . for example , you could insert a header ( Insert End@@ less Body Qu@@ ader ) and adjust the size to x = 100 , y = 0 and z = 100 , but this is a cum@@ ber@@ some method of solving this task .
&amp; k@@ rep@@ v@@ model@@ er ; actually offers a simpler option . you can insert an infinite layer as floor :
a good advice : select the level in the object tree , change the name and then press the Apply button or the Enter key . in the object tree , the new name will be displayed immediately .
the wire model view is now showing the level as well , if at the moment only as a fin@@ ite fin@@ ite level . if you render the scene , the plane expands to the horizon .
if you look at the object tree carefully , you will find that you can fold the entry for the bottom if you click on the + in front of the object . in this case , you will only see the default options for each new object : sc@@ aling , rotation and shifting . select one of these options , change the possible settings in the view of the object properties .
in this scene , you should move the floor to the exercise a unit under the horizontal line , only to get to know some of these parameters . choose Shift and set the values as follows :
first select the floor to adjust its material properties . there are many different materials , but at the moment select something simple .
in both cases , a dialog opens , in which you can select how the object is to be inserted . the pig@@ ment is then displayed in the object tree . you can change the name in the property view ( name = bottom pig@@ ment ) , with a click on the preview window , see how the pig@@ ment looks now .
of course , the pig@@ ment preview only shows a matt black material because you still need to enter settings for the pig@@ ment . therefore , always remember that you can preview the look of materials at any time with a click preview .
if you don &apos;t see color on the header and ball in the preview , just click on the Apply button and start the preview .
the material for the floor is set correctly now . if you render your image now with a click on the icon , you should get the following result :
of course , this is not the color you expected . in the color list you have to enter two new attributes , called one color . then edit the entry color list in the object tree . then edit this entry twice ( you can do this more often , but the ch@@ ess@@ board color list can only be used with two colors ) :
in the object tree , select Mon@@ och@@ rome each time and change the colors in the object &apos;s view :
this step should already be done simply because you should have understood the basic working method of &amp; k@@ rep@@ v@@ model@@ er ; the ball is just as easy to create as the ground :
in the view of the properties you can immediately change the settings . set the value for the radius : on 1 ( do not forget to press the Enter key or the Apply button ) , so the ball has contact with the ground . otherwise , the sphere would float above the floor as you moved the ground around one unit down@@ wards .
of course rendering now gives a strange result : as you can see before , the ball surface appears like a matte black material . in the following step , put a suitable material .
if you have chosen the ball , you can now assign a material to it . as with the floor , give the ball a pig@@ ment as color :
choose First sub@@ item and change the name for example in sphere of pig@@ ment . click on a sphere of pig@@ ment , then choose one color and set the values as follows :
but you can achieve more interesting effects if you take the time to adjust some finish properties :
then change the values as in the following scre@@ en@@ shots and click Apply or press Enter .
the gloss effect and reflection settings already result in some good visual effects , perfect for glass or chrom@@ ed surfaces , even if metal : not yet selected :
you should now have a good idea of what possibilities you would like &amp; k@@ rep@@ v@@ model@@ er ; hopefully you have already learned so much that you can create simple but beautiful scenes .
Ray@@ tra@@ y@@ cing is a R@@ ender method to create a two @-@ dimensional image of a three dimensional scene or model .
if you have a scene ra@@ y@@ tra@@ cen , the rendering of hyp@@ othe@@ tical rays sho@@ ots from the perspective of the viewer ( i.e. from the camera that render the scenes ) through every pixel in the scene . the render calcul@@ ates how this beam is reflected by the objects and how atmospheric effects such as fog effect . thus , the scene Pixel is processed for pixel .
as you can imagine , you will not see anything without a camera , the camera is your eye with which you view the scene . without a light source you see nothing , the picture is just black . obviously every scene needs to be rendered , some light sources and at least one camera .
in the usual file dialog , you can select your file . P@@ ov@@ ray files usually have the file extension * .@@ po@@ v or * .@@ inc .
open a file . in the standard file dialog , you can select a file you previously created with &amp; k@@ rep@@ v@@ model@@ er ;
whenever you open or create a new model , the file is inserted in this sub@@ menu and replaces the oldest entry in the list .
if you have already saved the model , it will be saved under the same name . if it is a new file , you will need to enter a name and disk space .
re@@ stores the scene in the last saved version . all changes since the last storage are disc@@ arded .
this menu entry can only be selected if you still have not saved changes in the scene .
repeat the last und@@ o command . this menu item can only be selected when you have modified the Edit feature .
save the current window order and open a dialog in which you can enter a name for a new arrangement or re@@ write an existing arrangement .
in this menu you will find options for setting &amp; k@@ rep@@ v@@ model@@ er ; here you can change the look , short@@ cut and default behavior .
opens a dialog for modi@@ fying key short@@ cuts . with this option , you can modify or add new commands pres@@ et by using this option for &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ;
opens a dialog to set up tool@@ bars . with this option you can add and remove tool symbols for &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; -@@ commands .
a B@@ ump @-@ map is a way to simul@@ ate rough surfaces without having to model each b@@ ump on the surface individually and without changing the geometric shape of the object itself .
it is common to use the same file for a B@@ ump map as well as for a texture map .
basic bodies are simple geometric shapes that you can use as blocks : very complex 3D models are produced from dozens or even hundreds of these basic bodies . these models are then processed further to give them a more realistic look .
a texture map is a way to give the surface of an object color to pixel basis by applying an image file as a color chart .
&amp; ku@@ ick@@ show ; is a comfortable image viewer and browser . the application has a file browser in which you can select images to display .
images can either be displayed in an own window in the size of the image or in full screen mode .
the use of &amp; ku@@ ick@@ show ; is very simple . the file browser lists files you can view by clicking the &amp; L@@ MB@@ N ; or the Return key .
you can specify whether each image should be displayed in a separate window , or if all the pictures should always use the same window .
if you are looking for a specific file , type the first character of the fil@@ ename in the browser window . then a small input field appears in the lower right corner . if a matching fil@@ ename is found , the file will be highlighted . you can leave the input field by pressing Return or &amp; Es@@ c .
in Di@@ alogue Con@@ figuration - &amp; ku@@ ick@@ show ; there are five cards . in three of them , General and Mach@@ ining and Sli@@ deshow , you can set the mode of operation of &amp; ku@@ ick@@ show ; in the two other , short instructions for the display window and short instructions for the browser , the short@@ cuts for the respective windows can be specified .
if this is selected , the images will be opened in full screen mode . if the image is not big enough to fill the screen , the rest of the display area will be filled with the background color , which you can set further below . default is not full screen mode .
if this item is activated , load &amp; ku@@ ick@@ show ; already the next image in the folder while you are still looking at the current image . this reduces the delay if you select the next image , and is especially suitable for a slide show .
with this option stores &amp; ku@@ ick@@ show ; when moving the name of the last opened folder . at the next start open &amp; ku@@ ick@@ show ; this folder in the browser window .
click on the colored bar to select a background color . this is used to fill the background of the screen in full screen mode . if in window mode the window is bigger than the image , the background will also be filled with the selected color .
you can &amp; ku@@ ick@@ show ; to set up that only some of the file types are displayed , which can also display the program .
with this option , the display window will be enlarged to the full screen for large pictures . this option is turned on as default .
determines whether the sli@@ deshow should start with the first image in the folder or with the selected image .
to change the value , you can enter a new value in the input field or use the sli@@ der or small arrows to the right of the input field . the default is 3 seconds .
if this value is set to 0 , the sli@@ deshow is repeated until it is broken off by the user . to change the value , you can enter a new value in the input field or use the sli@@ der or the small arrows to the right of the input field . the default is 1 .
change the short@@ cuts for the different modes of operation of &amp; ku@@ ick@@ show ; in the flash@@ cards short instructions for the display window and short instructions for the browser .
this option allows you to switch between two @-@ part view of the file system ( a window for the sub@@ folders and a window for the files ) and the one @-@ part view of the file system with folders and files in a window .
displays large icons for the files in the folder . this display is only possible in the short presentation .
displays small icons for the files in the folder . this display is only possible in the short presentation .
displays preview images for the files in the folder . this display is only possible in the short presentation .
shr@@ inks the image by 10 % . the factor is based on the current size of the image .
magni@@ fies the image by 10 % . the factor refers to the current size of the image .
closes the display window for the pictures . &amp; ku@@ ick@@ show ; also closed when no browser window is opened .
show the image in original size . this is only useful when automatic sc@@ aling is enabled .
open the Com@@ ple@@ tion field . enter the first character of the fil@@ ename you are looking for . if the file is found , it will be selected .
&amp; show photo ; is a &amp; quot ; photo editing based on &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; image processing . &amp; show@@ photo ; is part of &amp; digi@@ dy ; project .
&amp; show photo ; is a fast image processing with some powerful basic tools . you can use it to view your photos and perform correc@@ tions and changes .
as the rest of &amp; k@@ de ; is &amp; show@@ photo ; an open source project . this means it depends on the user to contribute his part to report at least problems and possible improvements .
&amp; show photo ; make it as easy as possible to report bugs or possible improvements . wherever you are in the program , the menu provides an entry with a link . if you use it , your browser opens a page for reporting problems and wishes . all required information is already filled out , and you can simply follow the instructions to give your message .
&amp; show photo ; is a project supported by a community . that means that users and developers are helping each other . if you are a common user of &amp; show photo ; then we would encourage you to ask other users of &amp; show photo ; in this mailing list , however , English is spoken , you should therefore be powerful .
the best start to participate in &amp; show photo ; to join the developer mailing list . instructions to join the developer mailing list of &amp; show photo ; .
&amp; show photo ; try to give you as much control over its operations as possible . there are many options that change the behaviour of &amp; show photo ; to access these settings , you need to set up a show@@ photo menu in the Settings menu . the Settings dialog is divided into eight pages . you can switch between these by clicking on the icons of the left side .
in the area of exposure indicators , you can select the color that is displayed when the under@@ - resp@@ . over@@ exposure indicator has been selected . dex@@ ter@@ ity should indicate the colors with what you are supposed to indicate . under@@ exposure should indicate a bright color and over@@ exposure a dark colour .
the main window of &amp; show@@ photo ; has a side bar at the right edge , which provides important information and actions to the selected images . you can also find the same page strip in the image processing . you can view it in which you click on one of the five tab :
&amp; skan@@ l@@ ite ; is an application to scan images that do not do more than scan and store images .
&amp; skan@@ l@@ ite ; is a simple application for scanning and storing images that no longer can be scann@@ ed and scann@@ ed as images . &amp; channels ; can open a dialog for each image or save the images instantly in a specified folder with automatically generated name and format . the user can also display the images before saving .
you can check the status of your scanner at the SAN@@ E project page by entering the necessary information on this search page : HTTP : / / www.@@ san@@ e @-@ projec@@ t@@ .org / c@@ gi @-@ bin / dri@@ ver@@ .@@ pl .
a standard scanner can be set on the command line of &amp; channels ; if this scanner cannot be opened or if no standard scanner is specified , then a dialog to select the scanner will be opened .
the user can select the scanner to be used and press OK to open the scanner .
the other settings contain more detailed options of the driver . &amp; channels ; ( lib@@ ks@@ ane ) does not particularly treat these options .
to scan an image , the user can only start a preview scan and then scan scan area for the final scan . the preview can be started by the preview button .
to better select the image , the user can zoom into the image and zoom out of the current selection . it can also adjust the zoom in such a way that the entire preview is in the window .
when the image is selected , the final image can be read with the scan button .
when you preview a preview in the settings , then the image will be shown in a preview window , as shown below . when pressed , then the image will be saved and lie ? en leads to a demo@@ li@@ tion and you will get back to the main window .
the Settings button will open the dialog with the same name in front of the main window . you can change the most important settings here .
the user can view the image if desired , before saving . in this case , the option must be selected before saving a preview . if this preview is not desired by the user , then the option must be selected .
this setting allows them to select the type like &amp; channels ; save images . open dialog for each image opens the dialog before each scann@@ ed image . if &amp; skan@@ l@@ ite ; it should automatically save with a generated name in a previously defined folder , then you need to select Save without asking for a fil@@ ename .
this setting defines where the images are stored in the Save without a file name . if the images are stored after each scan , then this folder will be used as default for the Save dialog . the default value is your home directory and you can change this with the button ...
this parameter defines an image pre@@ fix for the images to be saved and is also the suggested name for the image in the dialog for saving . the automatically stored image gets a num@@ eric suff@@ ix each time a picture is saved . the string # # # is replaced by the numbers .
the user can adjust the image quality used for saving . this value also changes the compression value when saving . if select the image quality , then the default value of Q@@ t will be used .
the Help button starts the K@@ DE Help with the &amp; skan@@ l@@ ite ; manual . the About Start@@ ed the K@@ DE about -@@ Dialog for &amp; Candi@@ l@@ ite ; The Settings button displays the dialog for Settings and C@@ lose can be used to finish &amp; input .

&amp; Amar@@ ok ; use like all other short@@ cuts . below , you can set up a list of these cuts and their function . you can set up the global short@@ cut by right @-@ clicking in the player window and selecting global short@@ cuts .
you may need to set up existing multimedia keys in such a way that they work as &amp; Amar@@ ok ; short commands . thus make your keyboard to &amp; Amar@@ ok ; control center .
the D@@ CO@@ P interface of Amar@@ ok has many general functions , mostly found in other K@@ DE programs . this section consists of six parts and is intended to describe the D@@ CO@@ P functions of collection , context browser , player , playlist , playlist browser and scrip@@ ting .
Amar@@ ok supports the command line options of Q@@ t and &amp; k@@ de ; in addition , Amar@@ ok has some own command line options .
you should give the user feedback if the script cannot be executed because of a missing dependen@@ cy . please check in your script to see if all the necessary modules are available and use k@@ dialog so that the user knows why a script does not run .
start with require &apos; Kor@@ und@@ um &apos; Res@@ cue Lo@@ ad@@ Error error = &apos; Kor@@ und@@ um ( K@@ DE bin@@ dings for fort@@ witter ) from k@@ de@@ bin@@ dings v@@ 3.4 is required for this script . &apos; &apos; k@@ dialog --@@ sorry &apos; # { error } &apos; &apos; exit end
in the scripts / templates folder you will find a lot of template scripts in many different languages . you can use them as the basis for your own scripts or simply add them to the required functions . you will quickly find that writing scripts is relatively simple .
with D@@ CO@@ P , your scripts can exchange data with Amar@@ ok and control Amar@@ ok . the easiest way is to use the d@@ co@@ p command ; any K@@ DE installation should be included .
most scrip@@ ting languages allow the execution of external programs and commands . in this way , the ex@@ ec ( ) function is mostly used . thus , d@@ co@@ p &gt; can be called relatively easily . here is an example in Python :
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; sends noti@@ fications to all running scripts . for this purpose strings are written to the standard input of the script . for this reason , scripts should continuously monitor their default input and respond accordingly to events . of course , a script can also ignore events if there is no use for it .
configure the script to display the setup dialog . to save and load the setup data , each script needs to take care of itself . if a script is started , Amar@@ ok sets the working folder to the folder where all the data should be stored .
track@@ Change signals that a new piece is played . the script could now ask for more information about the new track ( for example , the metadata or unit length ) with D@@ CO@@ P functions .
volume Change new@@ Volume indicates a change in volume . the new volume is an integ@@ er value between 0 and 100 .
custom@@ er.@@ Cli@@ cked : sub@@ menu it@@ em@@ Most paths Inclu@@ des the path to selected files of the playlist , if a custom menu entry has been cli@@ cked . in order to add an own entry , you can use the D@@ CO@@ P @-@ function d@@ co@@ p Amar@@ ok script add@@ custom@@ er.@@ Item ( sub@@ menu it@@ em@@ plate ) .
before &amp; Amar@@ ok ; termin@@ ates , or when the user stops a script , sends and Amar@@ ok ; the signal SIG@@ TER@@ M to the script . this signal should be processed to do e.g. cleaning operations , such as storing data or configuration settings .
Amar@@ oks &apos;s script management can also install script packages that the user &amp; z@@ b has downloaded from a web server . such packages are basically normal T@@ ar archives ( .@@ tar ) , which can optionally also be compressed with b@@ zip@@ 2 ( .@@ bz@@ 2 ) , so that the user can clearly see the archive as a Amar@@ ok script package .
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; 1.3 will only accept script packages with amar@@ ok@@ script exhaus@@ tion . for this reason , you should name your script packages right .
the main script must be exec@@ utable ( + x ) , the remaining modules to be loaded should not be exec@@ utable . use the T@@ ar parameter -@@ p to get the file rights :
if your script package is ready , you can download it at www.@@ k@@ de @-@ app@@ s.@@ org and attach the link to the W@@ iki script page of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; for your entry on k@@ de @-@ apps you should use the category Amar@@ ok ; scripts .
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; is an audio player for &amp; quot ; &amp; Amar@@ ok ; has many useful and powerful features and is nevertheless surprisingly easy to use .
with &amp; Amar@@ ok ; you can simply drag music into the playlist instead of working through endless menus . maybe you &apos;re looking for a very specific title for thousands in your collection . with &amp; Amar@@ ok ; &apos;s Collec@@ ting browser and quick search you will find the piece within seconds .
maybe you already have some play@@ lists , but can never decide which ones you want to hear ? then the play@@ lists browser is just right for you . and if the decision is still difficult , the dynamic mode and the smart play@@ lists automatically select the right music according to certain criteria .
Amar@@ ok has an excellent support for Apple &apos;s iPod , i@@ Ri@@ vers if@@ p and many generic USB devices . besides , many different audio systems can be used so THE@@ Y can choose to listen to how you want to hear your music . Amar@@ ok is intelligent , sexy and chic - just the right way to re@@ discover your music !
usually , in the base folder of the Amar@@ ok sources you have to enter the following to compile and install Amar@@ ok :
da &amp; Amar@@ ok ; auto@@ conf and autom@@ ake used , you should not have any difficulties when comp@@ iling . if you encounter problems , please report them in the &amp; k@@ de ; Mail@@ ing lists .
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; like most applications , has some options that can be activated or de@@ activated at compile time with the configure script . this is a list of available options .
for some of the comp@@ iling options , certain dependen@@ cies need to be satisfied so that they can be used . details can be found in the System Requi@@ rements section .
activ@@ ates de@@ bug@@ ging symbols . you have the choice between yes , no and full . if you want to help with the development of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; you should use full .
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; can be set up without effort using the setup dialog . the setup dialog has several learning flash@@ cards to set up the various functions of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; .
in addition to the playlist , the player window switches the player window in addition to the playlist . if the option is off , only the play@@ lists window will be displayed .
use mood bar@@ ometer : this function is only available if &amp; Amar@@ ok ; compiled with support for mo@@ od@@ bar . the option switches the experimental function of the sen@@ sing bar@@ ometer .
make a mood full : this function is only available if &amp; Amar@@ ok ; compiled with support for mo@@ od@@ bar . thus , the color scheme used for the mood bar@@ ometer is changed .
disc@@ ard mo@@ ods from the music files : this feature is only available if &amp; Amar@@ ok ; with support for mo@@ od@@ bar compiled . if this setting is enabled , .@@ mood files are stored on the location of the appropriate music files . otherwise , the .@@ mood files are stored in the &amp; Amar@@ ok settings folder ; ( usually ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / Amar@@ ok / mo@@ od@@ bar / ) .
external browser : lets you choose which browser from &amp; Amar@@ ok should be started when a browser is required .
use other browsers : here you can specify the path to another browser that is not in the list above .
save play@@ lists to save , save the current playlist automatically when you finish &amp; Amar@@ ok ; enable this option if you don &apos;t want to lose the current playlist on exit .
relative paths for manually stored play@@ lists : if you enable this setting , &amp; Amar@@ ok ; relative paths to the music files , starting from the location of the playlist , use . otherwise , the absolute position of the music files is stored .
keep the current piece visible during a piece change , that the play@@ lists window will pop up / down to always keep the running piece in the visible window range .
changes to the context browser automatically change the context browser as soon as the next piece is pi@@ ped .
in the App@@ ear@@ ance section you can customize &amp; Amar@@ ok ; the section is divided into three parts .
in the font section , you can set the use of different fonts in &amp; Amar@@ ok ; using proprietary fonts , the otherwise grey shown section is enabled . you can select fonts for the following range : play@@ lists windows , player windows and context browsers . press Select ... , so you can select a desired font from the selection dialog .
with the choice of user @-@ defined color scheme you have the choice of choice and can set your own color scheme . to do so , use the color sel@@ ector for foreground and background color .
continue playing at the start means that &amp; Amar@@ ok ; after program start , res@@ ume play automatically with the piece at the place where it was stopped at the last stop .
setting up the on @-@ screen display allows you to turn on the O@@ SD . if on @-@ screen display is enabled , a preview of the O@@ SD is displayed and you can view the effect of all settings in this preview directly .
the first option is the font . click Select ... to select from the dialog the desired font for the O@@ SD . the shadow box shadows causes the text to be displayed in the O@@ SD .
you can use your own colors to customize the O@@ SD colors for script and background . click on the color areas to open the color sel@@ ector dialog . if you do not use your own colors , the default colors will be used .
the display text box displays the text displayed in the O@@ SD . by typ@@ ing plac@@ eholders the O@@ SD can be adapted to your own needs . below is a list of available plac@@ eholders and what they mean .
the screen option is intended for x@@ in@@ ama users . this allows you to specify which screen of a multi @-@ monitor environment the O@@ SD should appear on .
the card audio output allows you to select an audio driver from the drop @-@ down box . some drivers still enable further adjustments in this card map .
the map collection is used to set all settings for your collection , including the folder and type of the database for the collection .
here you can select the folders , the &amp; Amar@@ ok ; search for music files . to include a folder in the collection , select the check box next to its name . this section also includes check boxes for setting as with the selected folders .
search recur@@ sively : this causes &amp; Amar@@ ok ; both the selected as well as their sub@@ folders will be searched by music .
monitor changes : enables &amp; Amar@@ ok ; to monitor selected folders on changes ( e.g. if music files are added or deleted ) . in addition , incre@@ mental search is performed to make the necessary changes to your collection .
import play@@ lists : make sure &amp; Amar@@ ok ; add all found play@@ lists in your collection folders ( .@@ pl@@ - and .@@ m@@ 3@@ u files ) to your collection . the automatically added play@@ lists will then appear in the play@@ lists browser later .
the install@@ ment database is used to select a database for the collection . the combination field driver : lets you choose between SQ@@ Lite or My@@ S@@ q@@ l . if My@@ S@@ q@@ l is selected , further installation in the sub@@ window My@@ S@@ q@@ l is necessary .
the My@@ S@@ q@@ l Device section is used to set up the database for &amp; Amar@@ ok ; on Calcul@@ ator : will enter the machine on which the My@@ S@@ q@@ l database is located . after that the network port is entered , under which the database is accessible . name : is the database name to which the connection is established .
use User@@ name : and Password : to enter the data needed to connect to the database .
the card card last@@ .@@ f@@ m establishes support for last@@ .@@ f@@ m . &amp; Amar@@ ok ; can transmit the names of played pieces to a last@@ .@@ f@@ m server and create music recommendations regarding the current piece if necessary .
here you enter your username and password for your Last@@ .@@ f@@ m profile . if you don &apos;t have a profile , you can register one on the last@@ .@@ f@@ m website .
send played pieces and thus update the profile : this setting enables it &amp; Amar@@ ok ; to transmit the names of the played pieces to your last@@ .@@ f@@ m profile .
retrieve similar interpre@@ ters : after activating this setting &amp; Amar@@ ok ; a list of similar interpre@@ ters to the played piece . you can view the list in the context browser . note : you do not need a last@@ .@@ f@@ m profile to use this function .
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; is an audio player for Unix systems ( like &amp; z@@ b ; Linux ) . for more information see the summary of the functions and the gallery with scre@@ en@@ shots .
Amar@@ ok only needs the k@@ deli@@ bs package and otherwise no other K@@ DE packages . you need to have k@@ deli@@ bs installed ( including the included programs , because &amp; Amar@@ ok ; requires some of them to find e.g. modules or scripts ) . we have written a small guide on how to compile k@@ deli@@ bs minim@@ ally .
some functions , such as O@@ SD , pres@@ upp@@ ose that your window manager will keep the relevant standards of fre@@ ed@@ es@@ kt@@ op@@ .org . Gn@@ ome will work for example . we try to support Amar@@ ok on all platforms , so we use k@@ deli@@ bs and Q@@ t because they provide an excellent development environment .
probably one of your files will get an error in the Tag@@ Li@@ b library for days . you can locate the file by clicking in ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / Amar@@ ok / collection _ sc@@ an@@ .@@ log . after that , you can delete the file that caused the crash . after that , you can delete the file and restore the collection again .
this is mostly due to the fact that Tag@@ lib is crashing from this file when reading the met@@ a @-@ information . please report this error to the Tag@@ Li@@ b developers at bu@@ gs@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org .
if you use MySQL as a database then try SQ@@ Lite . support for it in &amp; Amar@@ ok ; it is a bit more mature .
make sure that all libraries used by &amp; Amar@@ ok have been compiled with the same comp@@ iler version . if , for example , &amp; Amar@@ ok ; compiled with G@@ CC 3.4 , Tag@@ Li@@ b but with G@@ CC 3.@@ 3.@@ X , this leads to crash when editing the met@@ a information .
if you use K@@ DE with art@@ s@@ d then de@@ activate it autom@@ . disable if in@@ active for ... in setting the sound system , or at least do not use a value of 1 second .
you can also send us the back@@ trace via e @-@ mail ( the e @-@ mail automatically opens during a crash ) . if it is a frequently occurring crash and you send us a good back@@ trace , the error will be fixed .
this is because many programs write data as UT@@ F @-@ 8 in met@@ a @-@ information , but do not mark them as Uni@@ code . the following Perl script fixes the problem .
# ! / usr / bin / per@@ l die &quot; The file $ AR@@ GV &#91; 0 &#93; not &quot; unless -@@ f $ AR@@ GV &#91; 0 &#93; ; use MP3 : : M@@ p@@ lib &#91; 0 &#93; ) ; my $ v@@ 2@@ tag = $ mp@@ 3s &#91; 0 &#93; \ &quot; unless $ mp@@ 3s &gt; set _ v@@ 2@@ tag ( $ v@@ 2@@ tag , amp ; UT@@ F@@ 8 ) ;
this script requires the per@@ l module MP3 : : m@@ p@@ lib . it can be installed with this command : Perl -@@ M@@ CP@@ AN -@@ e &apos; install MP3 : : m@@ p@@ lib &apos;
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; s symbols in the status bar ( random mode / re@@ petition / dynamic playlist ) are always active in K@@ DE 3.@@ 4.0 . this is a well @-@ known bug in K@@ DE 3.@@ 4.0 . this can sometimes be resolved in the Control Center under the App@@ ear@@ ance of the Advanced . note that in some cases you have to click on a symbol for up to three times until this setting displays its effect .
if you get this error : amar@@ ok@@ app : symbol look@@ up error : amar@@ ok@@ app : Un@@ defined symbol : _ Z@@ N@@ 11@@ K@@ System@@ Tra@@ y@@ 9@@ set@@ Pix@@ map@@ ER@@ K@@ 7@@ Q@@ Pix@@ map , please check if Amar@@ ok is using the correct Q@@ t library . you can use ld@@ d &apos; which amar@@ ok@@ app &apos; _ BAR _ gre@@ p q@@ t .
to fix this error , you may need to remove any existing Q@@ t version or modify / etc / ld@@ .@@ so@@ .@@ conf so that Amar@@ ok will find the right version first .
there are some possibilities . most installation problems are most easily solved by the help of an expert on your Unix or Linux distribution . you can also help other users or developers . use the forum and the IR@@ C at ir@@ c.@@ fre@@ en@@ o@@ de@@ .net in the Channel # Amar@@ ok .
Bug@@ z@@ illa is not suitable for help . please enter only one error if you have something in fixing a bug in Amar@@ ok itself .
after the start of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; only a blank playlist appears . how do you get there now ?
this is simple . use the file browser on the left and open the desired folder . then drag the files to the right part of the playlist .
to keep the surface intuitive , the start sub@@ window has been converted to the statistics window . you can find it under Extras Statisti@@ cs .
the meaning of these symbols has changed with Amar@@ ok 1.4 Fast For@@ ward : stars represent the rating by the user while the points are calculated automatically .
to evaluate ch@@ un@@ ks , the playlist has to be shown in the playlist . click on the playlist of the playlist and select column . click anywhere in the new application column to set the rating for one piece . you can also use the short commands Windows + &#91; 1 @-@ 5 &#93; . this also works if Amar@@ ok is in the background .
select the files you want to remove , then press Del@@ ete on your keyboard . or right click on your selection and then select From Play@@ list from the drop @-@ down menu .
drag a playlist file with the mouse to the playlist and drop it there , just like you would do it with other files . it &apos;s as simple as that : - )
in the playlist of the playlist , next to the Add button , you can save the playlist to the playlist . click on it .
you probably don &apos;t have the program x@@ mms @-@ config . install the x@@ mms @-@ de@@ vel package and install &amp; Amar@@ ok ; new . also look for lib@@ visual , this package contains many very nice visu@@ aliz@@ ations .
the equ@@ alizer can be found in the context menu ( via the right mouse button ) . you can also find it via the menu bar under Extras E@@ quali@@ zer ....
none ! yes , that &apos;s true ! no ! &amp; Amar@@ ok ; uses one from the back@@ end independent approach , so the actual question must be : which types of media supports G@@ Stre@@ amer / x@@ ine / Arts / N@@ MM / MAS / K@@ DE@@ mm ? . as you can see , we can even de@@ code text and PNG !
it may ! perhaps you use F@@ ed@@ ora / Red Hat Linux , which will not include MP3 deco@@ ders in default ( for patent reasons ) . the solution : Alt @-@ F2 , gg : Red@@ Hat mp3 k@@ de , Enter key
start the Ya@@ ST online update and install the &apos; Multimedia Option Pack 1 &apos; . well ... &amp; Amar@@ ok ; play MP3 &apos;s : - )
if you use the G@@ Stre@@ amer driver with the Al@@ sa @-@ sink , the device must provide a mixer . a mixer allows multiple applications to use the device at the same time and to simultaneously output audio . this can be achieved by a sound card with hardware mixer ( e.g. S@@ B@@ Live ) or by the d@@ mix module for Al@@ sa ( software mixer ) .
the output of this command should help you find the cause and a solution . for G@@ Stre@@ amer , you might need to give a different sink ( e.g. bul@@ ky ) .
do not forget that media must first be deco@@ ded . you can &apos;t just send a MP3 to AL@@ SA , you &apos;d just want to hear a white noise . stre@@ amer is the best choice for most people if you want to have a decoder with little overhead . G@@ Stre@@ amer reads the file , de@@ codes them and sends the PC@@ M data to AL@@ SA . just like X@@ M@@ MS .
also X@@ M@@ MS de@@ codes the data first . stre@@ amer can output directly to AL@@ SA , just as x@@ ine .
either use the G@@ Stre@@ amer driver ( really great ! ) or optimize the settings of Arts . open Control Centre Sound &amp; Multimedia Sound System . enable sound server operated with highest possible priority ( real @-@ time priority ) and increase the size of sound buffer ( warning , see next point of the FAQ ! ) . make sure that art@@ sw@@ ra@@ pper su@@ id is set :
in K@@ DE 3.@@ 2.@@ X there are problems with K@@ DE@@ multimedia code@@ cs that can cause dist@@ orted playback . read this error report . to enlarge the sound buffer in your AL@@ SA configuration file .@@ as@@ o@@ und@@ rc can also help .
either do not use the Arts Driver but instead G@@ Stre@@ amer or x@@ ine , or install K@@ DE Multimedia to get the faster Arts Code@@ cs ( li@@ bar@@ ts _ mp@@ eg@@ li@@ b.@@ so &amp; etc ; ) .
probably use the Arts Driver . use another driver ( the x@@ ine driver has been optimized for analy@@ zer ) , or decrease the size of the Arts buff@@ ers in the control center and sound &amp; multimedia , sound system . the smaller the buffer , the less dre@@ amy the visu@@ aliz@@ ations react . yes , this is an error , please help us fix it .
G@@ Stre@@ amer is installed , but if I want to switch to the G@@ Stre@@ amer driver , cr@@ ashes &amp; Amar@@ ok ; why ?
after installing G@@ Stre@@ amer , you need to register all components . follow these steps to register all the G@@ Stre@@ amer components .
read the G@@ Stre@@ amer FAQ . if that doesn &apos;t help , you can also ask the IR@@ C channel # G@@ Stre@@ amer .
try this ( end Amar@@ ok before ! ) : - Download ff@@ m@@ peg , compile and install it . then run Disk , once as a system administrator and once as your normal user . then delete all ff@@ m@@ peg files in the module folder of G@@ Stre@@ amer ( you will find the module folder with you @-@ config / G@@ Stre@@ amer @-@ config ) and run it again . start now &amp; Amar@@ ok ; .
if you have a full list of suggestions / wishes , please send it to our mailing list : Amar@@ ok @-@ de@@ vel @ list@@ s.@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net .
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; is an album by the British Mike Old@@ field . I really like it and find that the name sounds good . besides , the name contains the magic ... : )
thanks to D@@ CO@@ P , this is already possible . set an alarm in your calendar program and run with the alarm this command : d@@ co@@ p Amar@@ ok player play
this command lets you start &amp; Amar@@ ok ; make sure that &amp; Amar@@ ok ; runs before you go to bed , then you will wake up from the soft sounds of the music you have stopped prior to going to bed .
how to get to know the current in &amp; Amar@@ ok when you &apos;re on another computer ?
if a functioning SSH environment is present , you can proceed as follows . this command gives you interpreter and title of the current piece : ss@@ h -@@ i ~ / .@@ ss@@ h / id _ r@@ sa ih@@ re@@ IP d@@ co@@ p --@@ user your@@ username Amar@@ ok player now@@ Pla@@ ying
replace your IP address with your IP and your username with your username . this requires your identification in the ~ / .@@ ss@@ h / id _ r@@ sa file .
the visu@@ aliz@@ ations can be separated from the &amp; Amar@@ ok ; window . press d on the keyboard and the current analy@@ zer opens in an independent window in the size .
the C@@ trl + right mouse button combination puts a piece in the click row in the queu@@ e . pressing the Enter key after a search in the playlist will play the first search result and reset the search .
OK , the player window and the playlist have tri@@ cky features , but what about the icon in the Control Panel ?
click with the &amp; R@@ MB@@ N ; on the title of a browser . in the context menu you can select which browsers are to be displayed .
my personal folder $ HO@@ ME is on a NFS mount . after the start of Amar@@ ok the collection database cannot be created and many error messages appear on the console .
the internal SQ@@ Lite database of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; does not work with NFS . either you need ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / Amar@@ ok to a local drive or use Amar@@ oks MySQL support .
insert the CD , then click on Audio CD in the menu . a file browser will open with multiple folders . for normal reading , change to the wa@@ v folders , select a few pieces and drag them into the desired destination folder in a Kon@@ quer@@ or window . for automatic encoding , instead , remove files from the folders mp3 or og@@ g .
Q@@ Str@@ ing@@ List values = query ( Q@@ String ( &quot; SE@@ LE@@ CT play@@ counter , cre@@ at@@ ed@@ ate , percentage FROM far@@ si &quot; &quot; W@@ HERE ur@@ l = &apos; % 1 &apos; ; &quot; ) .@@ ar@@ g ( escap@@ e@@ String ( ur@@ l ) ) ) ;
basically this fits the previous rating with a dimin@@ ishing value , based on how often the piece was played . the more often the piece has been played , the less influence each individual evaluation has on the overall result .
you can enter the rating for a piece by yourself by right @-@ clicking on a column header in the play@@ lists window . then you can change the evaluation of a piece just as all other attributes , namely by right @-@ clicking on the play and pressing : select review or press F2 . you can also edit the review in the Edit Metad@@ ata dialog .
the developers do not want you to tell you when to publish a stable version of Amar@@ ok . this means : K@@ DE packages have a specified publication plan that is not compatible with the short @-@ term plan of Amar@@ ok .
this is a new function in Amar@@ ok , which some users can also find anno@@ ying . de@@ activate the option icon when playing in the general settings .

audio cro@@ bb@@ ler is a free service sent to the information about which pieces are played on an independent server . the service is free and you only need a free user name and password . audio cro@@ bb@@ ler is fully supported by &amp; Amar@@ ok ; supported .
if you want to use AL@@ SA , please use the latest available version . old AL@@ SA versions have a lot of cr@@ ashes and therefore also a lot of error reports .
presum@@ ably &amp; Amar@@ ok ; compiled before you have installed x@@ ine or stre@@ amer . therefore , the . / configure routine did not compile this output module . you need to configure and install Amar@@ ok ;
now I &amp; Amar@@ ok ; new installed , but the output modules still don &apos;t appear . and now ?
you probably need a distribution that inst@@ alls the development files separately from the actual program . although G@@ Stre@@ amer is installed , the necessary developer files are missing . the same is true for x@@ ine , you will need to install x@@ ine @-@ de@@ vel . then you need to re@@ compile and install x@@ ine @-@ de@@ vel .
I get the error G@@ Stre@@ amer @-@ CR@@ ITI@@ CAL * * : factory for &apos; Ad@@ der &apos; has no type .. How do I fix this ?

I have a second sound card and use AL@@ SA . how can I use Amar@@ ok the second sound@@ card ?
setting Amar@@ ok under Settings ... Audio output enter the device . typically , for example , h@@ w : 0 is for the standard sound card and h@@ w : 1 for the second .
here is an example of ~ / .@@ as@@ o@@ und@@ rc on a machine with an on@@ board AC@@ 97 code@@ c and a USB audio device :
p@@ cm@@ .@@ intel@@ 8x@@ 0 { type plug sla@@ v@@ e.@@ p@@ cm &quot; h@@ w : 0 &quot; } ct@@ l.@@ intel@@ 8x@@ 0 { type h@@ w card 0 } p@@ cm@@ .@@ us@@ b @-@ audio { type plug sla@@ v@@ e.@@ p@@ cm &quot; h@@ w : 1 } } ct@@ l.@@ us@@ b @-@ audio { type h@@ w card 1 }
in the setup dialog by x@@ ine , enter us@@ b @-@ audio , and the output is done on the USB sound card . so @-@ lib takes care of the conversion of the sample rate , channels and so on ) .
if you want to use a virtual d@@ mix device , de@@ activate the tick on sound@@ card supporting m@@ map .
sorry , but the audio output with Arts is not taken care of . of course you are welcome to take this issue yourself ! if you like , you can become the new much @-@ needed super@@ visor for Arts : )
listening to music should be quite simple ! for this reason we have the setup wiz@@ ard that is displayed at the first start of &amp; Amar@@ ok . if you want to update your collection , or simply don &apos;t like the wiz@@ ard , then this Quick Start Guide will help you . with your help you will have set up &amp; Amar@@ ok ; in a few minutes .
creating a playlist is very simple . drag the mouse entries from the collection browser into the playlist . the small text box to filter the collection makes it easier to search for certain pieces . if you are satisfied with the playlist , you can save it by using the Play@@ list button . you will find this button in the playlist of the play@@ lists window .
if you have your own play@@ lists , you can add them to the playlist browser . if the playlist is included in the folders of your collection , and you have enabled the playlist to import , you are already in the tree view . with a right @-@ click on a playlist , you will get different options for loading the playlist .
to play an audio CD , please select A@@ ctions Audio CD in the menu bar . it opens a file browser with multiple folders and CD pieces in WAV format . drag the wa@@ v files to the playlist and then press the playback button .
the audio CD function uses the audio cd protocol : / and is not compatible with all available drivers .
the burning function is also available in the playlist . just click with the right mouse button on one entry and follow the burning menu . you have here various ways to burn a CD .
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; assumes the installation of some software packages . the required packages are listed below . additionally , some additional packages are listed which make the work with &amp; Amar@@ ok ; more enjoyable .
if you install these packages via a package management system ( e.g. RPM or apt ) , you also need to install the development versions of these packages !
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; is a versatile multimedia player . it offers many different ways to keep your music collection under control . like any normal multimedia player , also &amp; Amar@@ ok ; a player window with the most important features . additionally , &amp; Amar@@ ok ; however , a playlist that is superior to all others . the play@@ lists window contains several browsers with which you can collect and browse your entire music collection .
this chapter explains how all the functions of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; used , including creating a collection and a playlist .
the Player window is your one @-@ click &amp; Amar@@ ok ; control center . at the top of the window is a run@@ way display showing the current piece or the current stream . directly below is the area , the playing time , bit rate and sampling rate of the current play . a click on this area changes the display of the already expi@@ red playing time for the remaining playing time of the piece .
in addition , the player window contains a selection of audio analy@@ zers , including the current text display . you can switch through the available analy@@ zers by clicking the left mouse button on the area .
the &amp; Amar@@ ok ; Analy@@ zer can be separated from the player window . press d on your keyboard and the current analy@@ zer is displayed in an independent , magni@@ fied window .
the PL and E@@ Q buttons are also displayed under the text display . the PL button activ@@ ates or de@@ activ@@ ates the play@@ lists window while the E@@ Q button is used to set up equ@@ alizer .
the rest of the player window consists of the playback buttons , volume control and the piece @-@ position sli@@ der . use the sli@@ ders to adjust the piece position or volume . with the playback buttons you can start / stop playback and change to the next or previous piece .
using the built @-@ in equ@@ alizer is simple and works with all audio drivers . there are 17 pres@@ ets , from classic to tech@@ no , and you can easily create your own pres@@ ets .
to view the equ@@ alizer , use Tools E@@ quali@@ zer from the main menu or click the E@@ Q button in the Player window . once you select the check box E@@ quali@@ zer , the equ@@ alizer is in operation .
the playlist by &amp; Amar@@ ok ; is the most advanced playlist of all for &amp; k@@ de ; available multimedia player . it has many features that it does not exist in any other player . but don &apos;t let the wealth of functions deter you , they &apos;re all easy to use .
the play@@ lists window can be divided into two main areas , on the left side is the navigation pane . in the navigation area you will find some of the excellent functions of the playlist , such as the context browser . on the right side is the playlist itself . the playlist is easy to use and yet even for advanced users powerful enough .
the context browser shows different information about the current piece . the context browser contains three sub @-@ windows : music , text and interpreter . these three sub@@ windows will be explained in detail later . they provide information about the current play to each different aspect .
if you have already used earlier versions of &amp; Amar@@ ok , you might notice that the sub@@ window is off . the information presented there is now distributed in other parts of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; in addition , the information can be collected in the Statisti@@ cs window ( Extras statistics ) .
the music sub@@ window displays information about the current piece as well as the interpre@@ ters and the album .
the first section in this sub @-@ window displays information about the piece . the title contains the name of the album , the artist and the album . below , you can see the album &apos;s cover picture and a Musi@@ c@@ Bra@@ in@@ z symbol next to it . click on this icon to check the piece in the Musi@@ c@@ Bra@@ in@@ z database .
you can find more information about the current piece under the Musi@@ c@@ Bra@@ in@@ z icon . you can see here how often and when the piece was played for the first and last time as well as its evaluation .
to view cover pictures in the context browser , the cover pictures must be in the same folder as the current piece . the file formats .@@ jpg , .@@ j@@ peg , .@@ gi@@ f and .@@ pn@@ g are supported . the context browser will also display cover pictures that are either downloaded with the cover administration or embedded into ID@@ 3@@ v2 tags .
the next section , Recommen@@ ded pieces , lists several recommended pieces . if you click on one of these pieces , it will be played immediately .
among the suggested pieces there are the favourite pieces of this performer . this section shows the five highest rated pieces of the current interpreter .
you can specify which information to display in the music sub@@ window . to do so , right click anywhere in the sub@@ window and select from the context menu .
the last area , albums of the performer , lists all the albums of the current interpreter you have in your collection . if you click on an album , it will be opened and you will see the content of the album .
you can click all the pieces in the individual fields to start playing immediately . you can also right @-@ click on it and then select one of the options to add the piece or album to the playlist .
in the text sub@@ window , the downloaded song text is displayed for the current piece . this function is very flexible and it is possible to download texts from other websites using self @-@ written scripts . as soon as you click on the text sub@@ window , try and download the text for the piece from the Internet . if no text script is running , you can choose which to start .
the Edit button enables you to edit the lyrics text . the modified version is then saved in &amp; Amar@@ ok ; s collection database . no running text script is necessary .
the Search button opens a search on goo@@ gle@@ .com after the song text for the current piece ( in an external browser window ) .
group@@ ing Interpre@@ t - groups only the top level , each piece is displayed directly below the interpreter . albums or gen@@ res are left out of the list .
group@@ ing Interpre@@ t / Album - first the pieces are arranged according to the interpreter and below is a further split according to the respective album . if you want to see compositions or sound@@ track albums , this is the best view on your collection - these albums are displayed at the beginning of the list among various performers .
group@@ ing artist / year - Album - S@@ orted to Interpre@@ t and then after the year of the album in desc@@ ending order ( the newest first ) . if the year for an album is unknown , the default 0 - album name is related .
group@@ ing Album - All albums of your collection are sorted alphabe@@ tically among each other . the interpreter is ignored .
group@@ ing Gen@@ re / Interpre@@ t - your pieces are displayed first by genre and among them by interpreter .
group@@ ing Gen@@ re / Interpre@@ t / Album - This setting works as well as the above , but is additionally sorted by album underneath the interpreter .
with the help of the remaining buttons you can adjust and match the group@@ ing at will .
with the last button you can change the settings to the collection . note : &amp; Amar@@ ok ; will automatically re @-@ track your collection once you change something on the selected folders . if you own lots of pieces this might take a while .
directly below the tool@@ bar is a search filter . it beha@@ ves in the list view as well as in the tree view . notes about using this filter can be found in the section on the playlist in this manual .
the search filter is a selection box that lets you filter the last added pieces to your collection , starting from the last 24 hours to a year . of course , you can also select your total collection so that the filter is virtually switched off .
by clicking with the right mouse button on an entry in the collection browser , you will get the following options .
load - This cle@@ ars the current playlist and adds the selected pieces to play in the currently valid order .
attach to playlist - Add the selected pieces of the current playlist . by double @-@ clicking on one entry , you will reach the same effect .
set the pieces in the queu@@ e - This function adds the selected pieces to the queu@@ e . this will play you next .
save as a playlist ... - Save the selected pieces as a playlist . you will be asked for a name under which the list is to be saved .
transfer to Media Player - Add the pieces into the queu@@ e to transfer to the Media Player . for more details , see the section on Media Player Browser .
burn all pieces of this interpreter / Burn to CD - This will make the selected pieces sent to K@@ 3@@ b and burned either as a data or audio CD . if K@@ 3@@ b is not installed , this option is not displayed .
edit Metad@@ ata ( for n pieces ) ... - Open the Dialog box for piece information and lets you change the tags for one or more items .
( s ) Move files to the tr@@ ash@@ ers ... - Open a confirmation dialog . if you confirm this , the selected files will be deleted from your computer .
as a compilation , select the selected album as a compilation , wher@@ eu@@ pon it appears among various interpre@@ ters .
pick up syn@@ op@@ sis - Chan@@ ges the album marked as a compilation to a normal album . afterwards , the album will no longer be displayed under various interpre@@ ters , but again under the corresponding interpreter .
the play@@ lists browser makes the handling of many play@@ lists quite simple . among other things , he also contains smart play@@ lists .
the lower part of the Play@@ lists browser contains the smart play@@ lists . they use &amp; Amar@@ ok ; s built @-@ in database to automatically create some useful play@@ lists at run@@ time . the smart play@@ lists consist of :
never played : a playlist containing the pieces in your collection that have never been played .
even created smart play@@ lists are also possible . click Add Smart playlist to open the dialog for creating a new smart playlist , where you can enter all the required criteria for your new playlist .
the sub@@ window media player is used for the connection of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; for example , to use your iPod with &amp; Amar@@ ok ; to be able to use your iPod with &amp; Amar@@ ok ; for example , before starting &amp; Amar@@ ok ; if &amp; Amar@@ ok ; start , find the pieces on your iPod to Interpre@@ t sorted in the upper list view of the Media Player browser .
to transfer ch@@ un@@ ks to your iPod , drag the desired songs from the playlist and drop them on the list Interpre@@ t . if you &apos;re done , click Apply . this way , the pieces are uploaded to your iPod . if the transmission is complete , finish &amp; Amar@@ ok ; and lo@@ osen the drive connection for your iPod .
under the tool@@ bar , there is a search area you can search for a file . the search is especially useful in folders with very many files , because in the file list all files are hidden which do not match your search criteria .
in the lower part of the file browser , there is an address bar that lets you get music from a given URL . if you enter for example : / home / mi@@ ke / musi@@ k.@@ tar@@ .@@ g@@ z and press Enter , you can drag and drop the music from there to the playlist .
if the playlist is longer than in the window , the attachment of files can be difficult by simply falling down . in this case , holding the Shift key may be helpful : this will automatically insert dropped files at the end of the list , and not on the mouse position .
the playlist contains all the pieces you want to play . you can change the order by simply drag@@ ging the entries with the mouse to the desired place . as soon as you enter characters , only the pieces that contain the letters will be displayed . to reset the filter , press the button until the text box is empty again .
if you enter search terms separated by spaces , &amp; Amar@@ ok ; search for entries containing all search terms . if you enter , for example , two three , search will find all entries containing one , two and three .
if you enter OR between search terms , search for entries containing either one or the other keyword . for example : one OR two OR three . in this example , all pieces are found which contain one or two or three ( or a combination thereof ) .
if you want to search for entries containing spaces , then close the search term with go@@ ose @-@ feet : Mike Old@@ field . this will search for entries that Mike Old@@ field contains , but not after entries such as Mike J. Old@@ field .
if you specify a specific search column , you can also search for larger or smaller ones . for example : rating : &gt; 50 . this searches for pieces that have a higher rating than 50 .
if you want to search for a piece that does not contain a specific search term , set a minus sign in front of the search term : -@@ something is searching for pieces that do not contain anything .
you can combine these syntax variants as you like . example : Mike Old@@ field OR score : &gt; 50 comment : bad . this search for all the pieces that either contain Mike Old@@ field or have a higher rating than 50 and do not contain the comment .
you can set the sequence of entries by pressing the C@@ trl key , and then click with the right mouse button in the desired order to the entries . the entries will then receive a lab@@ eling with a number . the number corresponds to the order in which the pieces are played .
the playlist of the playlist is at the bottom of the window . it contains buttons for some functions of the playlist . on the left , you will find the Add button that you can add to the playlist . right next to it , you will find playlist , empty playlist and mat@@ ing .
next , the buttons will follow and restore , so you can und@@ o or restore changes to the playlist .
in the middle of the tool bar is a unique , magni@@ fied analy@@ zer . the refres@@ her rate can be adjusted by a click of the right mouse button on the analy@@ zer .
the last button in the tool@@ bar is menu . it opens the same menu as that which you get right mouse button in the player window . using this menu you can set up &amp; Amar@@ ok ; &apos; s configuration .
there are many other buttons available for the tool@@ bar , for example playback roles and volume control . you can set up the displayed buttons by clicking on the menu and setting up tool@@ bars ... Select .
the status bar gives you a quick overview of the useful information about the playlist . it displays the title of the current piece , the number of pieces and the total play time of all pieces . furthermore , the status for random mode and retri@@ eval can be easily changed by clicking the mouse double in the corresponding display area .
you can also hide the status bar . to do this , disable the status bar option in the General settings .
the context menu can be reached by clicking with the right mouse button in the player window , or by clicking in the playlist on the menu . using this menu , you can reach the settings of &amp; Amar@@ ok .
clicking on this entry will open the Visu@@ alization Plugin . there you can select the visu@@ aliz@@ ations of &amp; Amar@@ ok .
behind this entry there is a sub @-@ menu with links to this document and other information about &amp; Amar@@ ok ; .
the cover management is a useful tool for managing your cover pictures . you can start it by selecting actions cover management in the collection browser .
the cover management includes a list view of all albums in your collection . you can view all albums of an artist in your collection by selecting the artist on the left side .
with the View menu , you can choose what to display in the cover administration . select :
the queu@@ e administration received your big entry in &amp; Amar@@ ok ; 1.3 . with this feature , you have even more control over the playlist . after you have set a piece in the queu@@ e , the playlist will appear in the order in which &amp; Amar@@ ok ; the pieces will play : 1 is played first , 2 as second , and so on .
to manage the queu@@ e , open the queu@@ e management tool . if you want to add a piece to the queu@@ e , select the piece in the playlist and then click + . you can also simply add the pieces with the mouse or use the context menu in the playlist . you can then change the order of the pieces in the queu@@ e administration .
there are three types of dynamic play@@ lists , two of which are already given ( the details to set up these later ) .
fill up your playlist with random pieces from your entire collection and add more random pieces while playing .
add pieces based on Last@@ .@@ f@@ m recommendations ( formerly : audio @-@ cro@@ bb@@ ler ) . this mode requires that some pieces are already in your playlist . you do not need a Last@@ .@@ f@@ m profile for this dynamic playlist to work .
double click on the playlist you want , drag it to the play@@ lists window or right click on it and then select Load . thus , your current playlist will be replaced by the new one . you should then save the old playlist under certain circumstances !
the two pres@@ et modes Pack@@ ed Mix and Play@@ lists mix immediately fill up your playlist and you can start playing directly . the playlist receiving items will begin with a blank playlist and you will need to add at least one piece of your collection . the requested pieces will be added to the next piece of play , so your playlist will only be filled at the end of the first piece .
if you want to keep the current playlist , enable the last possible dynamic mode : settings Dynamic mode . this will use your existing playlist as a starting point . using the same menu entry , dynamic mode can also be disabled again .
the New will fill the current playlist and add new pieces according to the dynamic mode . edit the playlist opens the dialog to edit the playlist and you can change the appropriate settings .
with a right @-@ click on a dynamic playlist , you have the option to click Edit . then the dialog opens to edit the playlist settings .
enter any name for the playlist here . however , the name should be unique to avoid confusion .
if this setting is not active , your playlist will continue to grow , the setting for upcoming plays will be ski@@ pped and you will not hear a piece in this playlist . however , if the setting is active , the played pieces will be removed while resp@@ ecting the selected pieces .
played pieces - this is the number of pieces played , which should be kept at the beginning of the playlist , so you can easily see which pieces have been played recently .
this is the number of pieces to be added to the playlist after each piece played . if you set more than 1 here , the playlist will continuously grow , because only one piece can be played and removed .
the settings on the right @-@ hand side have already been described in the previous section . on the left side of the dialog , you can select from already existing play@@ lists or smart play@@ lists . if you cross multiple play@@ lists , you will add random pieces from each of the play@@ lists crossed .
some scripts allow your own settings . you can customize the settings by starting the script and then clicking on .
you can install new &amp; Amar@@ ok ; install scripts by clicking on the script . a select dialog will open , in which a script package can be selected for installation . after you have installed the script , a new entry will appear in the list . you can also install new scripts directly from the Internet .
if you don &apos;t want to use a script any longer , you can delete it . to do so , select the script to be deleted and then on Un@@ install .
if you are looking for information on writing your own scripts , please refer to the Writ@@ ing of Scrip@@ ts section .
the dialog window visu@@ alisation plug@@ ins will be used to enable the available visu@@ aliz@@ ations in &amp; Amar@@ ok ; the window contains a list of all available plug@@ ins . to use a plugin , simply activate the check box next to the name .
this Quick Start should show you how to create an audio CD with &amp; k@@ 3@@ b in four steps . to understand the steps , you need to have an exec@@ utable installation of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; and have a folder with audio files .
this is a dialog box where you can select which files you want to burn to CD .
if you want to burn an audio CD from MP3 s or other los@@ sy compressed formats then remember to get a worse quality when re@@ encoding MP3 , no matter how high the bit@@ rate is . you can check if an audio CD was created by a los@@ sy format .
in this dialog box you can do nothing . please wait until the computer has finished the burning process .
this Quick Start should show you how to copy &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; a data CD in just four steps . to understand the steps , you need to have an exec@@ utable installation of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; have and put the source CD into the CD @-@ Rom drive .
to copy a data CD , please select Extras , CD copy ... from the menu . you now see a dialog with the possible settings to burn .
after you have done all &amp; k@@ 3@@ b settings , press the Start button . you can now see a dialog that looks like this :
in this dialog box , you can track the progress of the copy process . once the original image is read in the image file , you will be promp@@ ted for an empty CD medium to which the data should be burned .
&amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; burn the image file . you have to wait until the total progress has reached 100 % .
&amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; burn the image file . you have to wait until the total progress has reached 100 % .
the Q@@ T designer tool U@@ IC can &apos;t find the Wid@@ get modules . to fix this problem , run q@@ t@@ config and add $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ RS / lib / k@@ de@@ 3 / plug@@ ins to the search path for libraries ( replace $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ RS by your base folder of &amp; k@@ de ; ) .
the website of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; can be found at www.@@ k@@ 3@@ b@@ .org . there you will get the latest version of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; you can also get feedback there , draw on community help from the forums and learn new news .
if you want to use &amp; k@@ 3@@ b , you need at least &amp; k@@ de ; 3.1 and &amp; Q@@ t ; 3.1 .
&amp; c@@ dr@@ da@@ o ; : this program burns audio or data CD tracks in a run ( also called disk @-@ at @-@ once mode or DA@@ O ) based on a tex@@ tual description of the CD content ( TO@@ C file ) .
&amp; c@@ d@@ record ; / m@@ kis@@ of@@ s ; : burn all kinds of CD @-@ R@@ s . &amp; c@@ d@@ record ; has all the functions that are also &amp; c@@ dr@@ da@@ o ; therefore , &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; usually automatically sel@@ ects &amp; c@@ d@@ record ; to burn CDs . in some cases , &amp; c@@ dr@@ da@@ o ; however , a higher quality with burned audio CDs .
c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia : a program for reading digital audio from a CD ( CD@@ DA - Compact Disc Digital Audio ) . in the Internet such programs are commonly referred to as Ri@@ pper .
OGG Vor@@ bis Library : OGG Vor@@ bis is a completely open , pat@@ ent@@ less and professional audio encoding and for dealing with audio data streams . OGG Vor@@ bis benefits from open source and stands in direct competition to MP3 . this library is used by O@@ gg Vor@@ bis de@@ oder@@ - and encoder modules .
M@@ ad : this is a high quality MPEG @-@ Audio decoder . it currently supports MPEG @-@ 1 , MPEG @-@ 2 and MPEG 2.5 . all three audio layers Layer I , Layer II , and Layer III ( e.g. MP3 ) are fully supported . this library is used by the MP3 decoder module .
l@@ ame : a well developed MP3 decoder that can compete in terms of quality and speed with commercial enco@@ ders . l@@ ame is used by the MP3 encoder module .
FLA@@ C : a free open source code@@ c for los@@ s@@ less audio compression and de@@ compression . it is used by the FLA@@ C decoder module and the external audio encoder module , so you can read and write FLA@@ C files .
li@@ bs@@ n@@ d@@ file , FF@@ m@@ peg , FLA@@ C , Mus@@ ep@@ ack Decoder : additional libraries for processing different audio formats . with FF@@ m@@ peg , for example , it is possible to de@@ code WMA files to burn them to an audio CD .
SO@@ X : a utility that can convert and convert between different audio formats . SO@@ X is used by So@@ X Audio Enco@@ der module .
trans@@ code : a command line program for video processing . you need it if you want to read a DVD .
V@@ C@@ DI@@ MA@@ ger : a fully equipped auth@@ oring system for editing , dis@@ assembling and analy@@ sing video CDs and super video CDs .
norm@@ alize : this tool is used to customize the volume of music files to a standard level . this can be useful e.g. for creating mixed CD &apos;s and M@@ p@@ 3 collections ; without Norm@@ alize , the different recording levels of the different albums can lead to the un@@ attractive effect that the music pieces can be played differently .
e@@ Mo@@ vi@@ x : this is a very small Linux distribution . it contains the necessary software to start from CD and automatically re@@ play all videos in the base folder of the CD .
this is a convenient way to rel@@ o@@ ad recently opened projects . the associated sub@@ menu contains a list of these projects . clicking on one entry will open the project .
save the current project . if the project has already been saved , the previously created file will be over@@ written , otherwise it will be asked for a new fil@@ ename .
save the current project under a new file name . K@@ DE &apos;s dialog Save As is displayed with which you can choose folders and fil@@ ename for the project file .
save all opened projects . this is the same as if you would call for each project file Save .
closes the current project . if a project has been changed and not yet saved , ask &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; after what is to happen . you can then disc@@ ard between saving and changes . furthermore , you can also cancel the closing and keep the project open .
includes all opened projects . &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; will ask for any un@@ saved project what should happen with it , just as if you had called for each project file closing .
closes all opened projects and termin@@ ates &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; . for each project not stored you will be asked what to do with it , as if you had called file C@@ lose .
when you call this entry , you can select files to add to the project via the appearing dialog . this has the same effect as if you drag the files directly from the top view into the project view . if the current project is a data CD , the added files will appear in the base folder of the CD .
opens the &quot; Burn &quot; dialog for the current project . this dialog is basically the same as the Properties dialog of the project . the only difference is the additional firing pressed , the &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; to burn the medium . the burning dialog can only be opened if the project already contains data .
opens the Properties dialog for the current project . here you can make many project @-@ related settings . each project type has different possible settings , most of them are described by what is the ? -@@ help ( accessible via the right mouse button ) .
this entry will only appear on an active data CD / DVD or video DVD project . it causes &amp; k@@ 3@@ b to import files from a previous session into the current project . this is useful if you put files for a multiple session CD . this is useful for you , even if this function is not used . it is intended for you rather than help so you can see the files and folders already available on the medium .
this entry will only appear on an active data CD / DVD or video DVD project . this function causes &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; to remove imported files from the current project . all other files remain in the project . this function does not remove any files from the medium , it only covers the previously imported files .
opens the CD copy dialog . this allows you to copy a CD to another medium without a project file . alternatively , you can only create an image from a CD which you can then burn later . you should also prefer cl@@ oning if you want to copy CDs with defective sectors or video CDs .
opens the DVD copy dialog . this allows even without a project file to copy a DVD to another medium . alternatively , you can only create an image from a DVD which you can then burn later . furthermore , there is also the possibility of copying DVD using the copy dialog . therefore , the target medium has to be large enough to capture the entire ( video ) data of the source medium in the original form .
opens the dialog for del@@ eting a CD @-@ RW . this allows you to delete the entire content or parts of a CD @-@ RW .
opens the dialog to format a DVD . this dialog allows you to format a DVD ± R ( W ) , so that the content is completely deleted . &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; lets you choose between the write modes over@@ writing and incre@@ mental .
the dialog asks you for a * .@@ iso , * .@@ cue or * .@@ to@@ c file as a data source that can then be burned immediately by pressing the burning button . ( min@@ k * .@@ n@@ r@@ g files are currently not supported yet , therefore you need to use other tools such as Nr@@ g@@ 2@@ I@@ so . )
if a previously created DVD image is burning , the dialog asks you for a * .@@ iso file as a data source , which can then be burned immediately by pressing the burning button .
a previously read @-@ out DVD @-@ Video can be converted . this dialog window usually appears after reading a DVD in the table of contents , but can also be used alone . it contains information about the read @-@ out video , encoding settings , and even options for changing the size and cutting black edges .
displays information about the inserted medium . this information is presented in the table of contents and contains the properties of the medium , such as the size and title length of the CD or DVD .
shows a list of tool@@ bars of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; if an entry is selected , the tool@@ bar is currently visible in the main window .
when this is crossed , a small bar is displayed at the bottom of the window . it contains information about the status of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; and its activities . if this is not crossed , the status bar is hidden .
the folder view contains an overview of your folders and the CD / DVD drives . if the content view is enabled , its content is displayed in the table of contents . CD / DVD drives also have a context menu with functions such as Media Info , locking and un@@ locking the drive or ej@@ ection of the medium .
the contents view allows selecting and drag@@ ging files into the project view . the contents view is also the interface to read audio or video CDs , provided that a drive with a corresponding CD / DVD was selected in the folder view .
the header is a narrow section that is only visible when the project view contains open projects . the header has no real function , it only looks pretty and separates the project view from the remaining views .
this opens a dialog box to change the key assignments for &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; after selecting one of the available commands in the upper part , you can adjust the key assignment below .
this will start the k@@ 3@@ b ; setup wiz@@ ard . this allows the correct per@@ missions to burn CDs and DVDs . for this , system administrator rights are required , so you must enter the system administrator password ( root ) when you start the wiz@@ ard .
opens the settings of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; here , general program settings can be made . almost all functions of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; should work at first exit . this dialog is intended for person@@ alization and fine adjustment of the program .
&amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; is , like many other &amp; k@@ de ; applications also equipped with a &amp; D@@ CO@@ P interface . with the help of this interface parts of functionality can be controlled for example via a shell script .
to use the &amp; D@@ CO@@ P functions , you can either use the command line program d@@ co@@ p , or the more comfortable program K@@ d@@ co@@ p . both programs are identical in the range of functions , so your taste and the type of your task is decisive , which of the included programs give you the preference .
in this chapter we assume you are using the d@@ co@@ p command line program . to use the &amp; D@@ CO@@ P functions , you need to make sure that &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; then enter something like the following at the console :
in addition to the general &amp; D@@ CO@@ P ; -@@ functions that all &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ program have in common , supported &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; mainly two more parts , which are described below .
the Standard D@@ CO@@ P interface from &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; provides functions such as copy@@ CD , format@@ DVD and further functions for creating new projects .
D@@ CO@@ P@@ Ref cre@@ ate@@ Data@@ CD@@ Project ( ) D@@ CO@@ P@@ Ref cre@@ ate@@ wi@@ g@@ Project ( ) D@@ CO@@ P@@ Ref cre@@ at@@ Mo@@ vi@@ x@@ CD@@ Project ( ) D@@ CO@@ P@@ Ref cre@@ ate@@ Mo@@ vi@@ x@@ CD@@ Project ( ) D@@ CO@@ P@@ Ref cre@@ ate@@ Mo@@ vi@@ x@@ CD@@ Project ( ) void ( ) void bour@@ n@@ C@@ d@@ Image ( ) void bour@@ n@@ D@@ v@@ d@@ Image ( URL ur@@ l ) void bour@@ n@@ D@@ v@@ d@@ Image ( K@@ URL ur@@ l )
as a result of such a cre@@ ate@@ XX@@ X@@ Project @-@ method you get a D@@ CO@@ P reference to the newly created project : D@@ CO@@ P@@ Ref ( k@@ 3@@ b , K@@ 3@@ b@@ Project @-@ 0 ) Altern@@ atively , you can get a project via the command line : # k@@ 3@@ b --@@ audi@@ oc@@ d and then a reference to the project is possible to change the project via K@@ 3@@ b@@ Projec@@ t@@ Interface .
K@@ 3@@ b offers the K@@ 3@@ b@@ Projec@@ t@@ Interface above and the powerful K@@ 3@@ b@@ Data@@ Projec@@ t@@ Interface , which is only applicable to data @-@ projects ( CD and DVD ) :
void cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der ( Q@@ String name ) void Cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der ( Q@@ String name , Q@@ String parent ) void add@@ Ur@@ ls ( K@@ URL : : list ur@@ ls , Q@@ String path ) void re@@ am@@ e@@ Item ( Q@@ String path , Q@@ String ne@@ wn@@ ame ) void set@@ Volum@@ e@@ ID ( Q@@ String id )
this makes it possible to fill a data project with files and folders from a script . for example , the following script creates a data project , several folders and then inserts files into the new folder :
# ! / bin / b@@ ash PRO@@ J@@ ECT = $ ( d@@ co@@ p k@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b@@ Interface cre@@ ate@@ Data@@ CD@@ Project ) d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ ECT cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der fo@@ o d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ ECT cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der fo@@ o d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ ECT pad@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der fo@@ o d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ ECT cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der fo@@ o d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ ECT cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der fo@@ o d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ ECT cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der fo@@ o d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ ECT cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der fo@@ o d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ ECT cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der fo@@ o d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ ECT cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der fo@@ o d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ ECT cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der fo@@ o d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ ECT cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der fo@@ o d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ ECT cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der fo@@ o d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ ECT cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der fo@@ o d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ ECT cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der fo@@ o d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ ECT cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der fo@@ o d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ ECT cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der fo@@ o d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ ECT cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der fo@@ o d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ ECT cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der fo@@ o d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ ECT cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der fo@@ o d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ ECT cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der fo@@
&amp; k@@ audio@@ .sys ; is an audio CD ; -@@ Reader for &amp; k@@ de ; . with it you can easily read audio CD ; s can be read out and stored in MP3 or OGG files . also other formats are possible depending on the encoder that is installed on the computer .
&amp; k@@ audio@@ .sys ; is the user interface of c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia ( for reading &amp; CD ; data in WAV files on the hard disk ) and by many enco@@ ders that coding these WAV files ( compressed ) . currently , l@@ ame for MP3 , og@@ gen@@ c for O@@ G@@ Gs and FLA@@ C ( los@@ s@@ less compression ) are currently supported . more enco@@ ders can be added to the program ( if they have been installed ) .
first , the titles of the &amp; CD ; read out and saved in WAV files on the computer ( los@@ s@@ less and compressed ) ; and then
in a second step , these wa@@ v files ( usually one per title ) are compressed into the MP3 or OGG format or also in other formats like the los@@ s@@ less FLA@@ C .
for the first step , reading the &amp; CD ; , is used by &amp; k@@ audio@@ creator ; c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia . almost every distribution has compiled a pre @-@ compiled package ; if this is not yet installed , this must be done now .
for the second step , l@@ ame ( for MP3 ) , og@@ g@@ vor@@ bis ( for OGG ) or other enco@@ ders need to be installed . all these programs are usually not necessary for any Linux distri@@ butions , so it is very likely not necessary to compile it yourself . however , if FLA@@ C is not used , its installation is also not required .
which encoding / file format should be used ? chapter Wel@@ cher Ko@@ di@@ ver gives a small introduction about enco@@ ders , audio quality and compression factors .
a word to copy protected audio CD ; s : as mentioned earlier , &amp; k@@ audio@@ .sys ; c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia for reading the audio data from the &amp; CD ; this program is not provided to handle any copy protection . if not the firmware of the &amp; CD ; / DVD device does not cover the protection , it is not possible to b@@ ypass the mechanisms of copy protection . simply avoid purchasing copy @-@ protected audio CD ; s !
while the setup needs to be done only once ( but the setup dialog can be called so often until a suitable configuration is found ) , the daily approach to reading a &amp; CD is explained . this ( hopefully ) leads to an understanding of the lean approach of the user interface that you will often stum@@ ble at the beginning .
can convert to many formats - depending on which enco@@ ders are installed ( MP3 , OGG , FLA@@ C &amp; etc ; )
can &amp; CD ; retrieve information from the fre@@ ed@@ b from the internet or can work completely without network , with everything being manually recorded .
this is just a short list of the main window commands . on the step by step example , you will find more information about how this program is used , as well as scre@@ en@@ shots with descriptions of the tab@@ s for configur@@ ing the program .
the CD@@ DB request of the CD data starts with the setup of request in the CD@@ DB file tab . ( this can be local or online , in the latter case the connection to the Internet must first be established . )
starts reading and - if a encoder is configured in the encoding settings in the setup guide - coding .
opens a sub @-@ menu with a list of available enco@@ ders , so that the selection with a different encoder can be read as the default . it is important to note that before the encoder is configured in the encoding settings in the setup dialog .
opens the file manager , so that an already read file is selected for encoding instead of a full &amp; CD ; read and code .
opens the setup dialog box to configure the type of noti@@ fications ( such as logs , Pi@@ ep@@ sen ) for program events ( such as reading the &amp; CD ; termin@@ ating ) .
opens the main setup dialog from &amp; k@@ audio@@ .sys ; with different card cards ( like encoder , to set up the encoder ) . here you must go before the program can be used successfully !
this chapter describes tone quality , enco@@ ders and compression rati@@ os and helps you choose the right coding .
if no audio information is lost , a los@@ s@@ less audio format is required . besides FLA@@ C there are also other such as &apos; sh@@ orts &apos; or &apos; monkey &apos; that may be available for this distribution . the dis@@ advantages are the low compression rates and hardly available commercial devices that can reproduce these files .
among the audio formats that lose information through data compression depending on their psycho@@ acoustic model , MP3 and OGG are the most common . OGG mag today has an easy advantage over MP3 in audio quality at lower bit@@ rates ( up to 128 k@@ bps ) , but over this bit rate the differences are less important because both enco@@ ders produce very good audio quality .
O &apos;@@ nt so &apos; free , l@@ ame will still be supplied with most distri@@ butions for free , but there are open license questions
+ high to very high sound quality ( with high bit rates ) , but compared with OGG , slightly lower quality with lower bit@@ rates .
OGG - if only music is heard from a computer or computer based music system and / or when one of the few existing OGG play@@ sets is present .
MP3 - if music is also to be heard on other devices , such as standard DVD players , portable devices ( USB stick , memory card , hard disk ) or special auto stereo systems . today - at the beginning of 2009 - these devices usually support only the MP3 format .
a short list of audio quality parameters and resulting compression rati@@ os for &apos; l@@ ame &apos; ( MP@@ 3s ) ( see &apos; l@@ ame --@@ help &apos; for further parameters ) :
&apos;@@ --@@ pres@@ et media &apos; = This setting gives good transparency for most people and most of the music
&apos;@@ --@@ pres@@ et standard &apos; = This setting should usually provide acceptable transparency for most people and most music pieces , and has quite high quality . good enough for hi @-@ fi stereo systems with high quality .
&apos;@@ --@@ pres@@ et extreme &apos; = 224 to 256 k@@ bps V@@ BR , compression rate up to 6.3 . requires up to 320 k@@ bps for complex music pieces and a little less for less complex parts of the piece . good enough for hi @-@ fi stereo systems with high quality . this is the preferred choice .
&apos;@@ --@@ pres@@ et extreme -@@ b 256 &apos; = 256 k@@ bps C@@ BR , compression rate about 5.5 . still needs 256 k@@ bps for complex and less complex pieces of a track . some older devices need C@@ BR@@ s . good enough for hi @-@ fi stereo systems with high quality .
&apos;@@ -@@ h &apos; = 128 k@@ bps C@@ BR , common stereo , compression rate approx . 11 128 k@@ bps for all songs of a song . good enough for music by you@@ ths , portable devices and auto stereo systems . but not good enough for better HiFi stereo systems .
&apos;@@ --@@ pres@@ et In@@ san@@ e &apos; = 320@@ k@@ bps C@@ BR . this setting will be over@@ done for most people and most environments but if you absolutely want to have absolutely highest quality without regard to the file size , then select this setting .
the &amp; CD ; information that is manually entered or downloaded by the program automatically from fre@@ ed@@ b over the Internet is available in the program as a list of parameters . you can pass / used with &amp; k@@ audio@@ .sys ; and the coding program to generate the folder and file names as well as the properties of the music files .
in connection with coding programs , there is often a combination of program settings for the encoder and these parameters here . the manual or the help to the enco@@ ders explain the switches for these programs .
for example , to add CD title to the keywords ( English : tag ) if MP@@ 3s are enco@@ ded with l@@ ame , the switch -@@ tt from l@@ ame and the title parameters of &amp; k@@ audio@@ .sys may be added . the result looks like this : &apos; ... -@@ tt { title } ... &apos; .
this is a summary of &amp; k@@ audio@@ files ; parameters that can be used ( = button name in the wiz@@ ard ) :
this is what the fre@@ ed@@ b is : a free database where people can read / write the audio CDs , so that all the others can download this information instead of entering the computer . it is important to note that here only text is spoken : &amp; CD ; Title , Artist , names of the pieces &amp; etc ; , not from the audio file itself .
yes , it should be legal , but I am not a lawyer . however , no one can prevent you from the &amp; CD ; however , no one can prevent you from being inf@@ lic@@ ted by the &amp; CD ; more or less valuable , so neither the artist nor the music company can be har@@ med . all information can anyway be obtained from a b@@ um@@ mel by a &amp; CD ; business , physical or virtual .
in &amp; k@@ audio@@ .sys ; is active to select a check box ( sending an address ) . for use of fre@@ ed@@ b can be used with another ( f@@ ake ) address than those used in the system . in this type of configuration , it seems , the email address will not be used when retri@@ eving the data from the server ( This may only know the progra@@ mmer who has checked the code . )
there are copies of the main database in many countries . if &amp; k@@ audio@@ .sys may be set up to use fre@@ ed@@ b , the ge@@ ographi@@ cally closest mirror server should be used . this saves bandwidth on the network and balances the load between the hosts .
a visit to fre@@ ed@@ b@@ .org provides a current list of mirror servers for the online retri@@ eval of &amp; CD ; information while reading a &amp; CD ; alternatively the entire database can be downloaded or ( usually issued monthly ) only the updates of the database .
which reading program is used to record pieces from the &amp; CD ; to save in wa@@ v files on my computer ?
there are rum@@ ors that c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia is used ; if you want to know more accurately , search in source code .... This was always the best choice for reading audio CD ; see note that the c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia package must first be installed from the appropriate distribution if this has not yet happened .
to save the read @-@ out WAV files , the encoder and thus the desired file format can be selected . at first opening are pre@@ defined entries for l@@ ame ( MP@@ 3s ) , og@@ gen@@ c ( O@@ G@@ Gs ) and FLA@@ C ( los@@ s@@ less compression for audio data ) on the tab to set up the encoding . other enco@@ ders can be added on this tab .
the Ko@@ di@@ ver package must be installed by the Linux distribution concerned before the encoder can be used . this is also required for the pre@@ defined enco@@ ders . more information about enco@@ ders can be found in the chapter Wel@@ cher Ko@@ di@@ erer .
after installing a encoder , you can get more information about its switch by entering a command such as l@@ ame -@@ help or l@@ ame --@@ help in a console window ( eg ; kon@@ sole ) .
this can have many causes . check the device name of the &amp; CD ; / DVD drive , the write and read real on it and if both c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia and the audio enco@@ ders of your choice ( l@@ ame for MP@@ 3s , og@@ gen@@ c for O@@ G@@ Gs , fla@@ c &amp; etc ; ) are installed .
check if you do not want a copy protected audio CD ; please check the sleeve of the &amp; CD ; this will not work !
there is a chapter with a step by step example . even if you use other settings , you can give tips on how to proceed .
have you read the complete manual , understood everything , but are somehow still uncertain what to do ? well , no problem , follow this step @-@ by @-@ step example , and you will get enough information to set up those areas that make the program exactly what you want .
in this example we will start the program for the first time , set up everything and read our first &amp; CD ; we will use l@@ ame &apos; --@@ pres@@ et extreme &apos; to generate MP@@ 3s with a V@@ BR ( variable bit@@ rate ) from 224 to 256 k@@ bps on average and ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 1 keywords ( tags ) .
it must be c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia and l@@ ame already installed on your computer . both programs should be found as pre @-@ compiled packages for your Linux distribution . an appropriate package for l@@ ame can be found for example with a search engine , as it is considered not entirely free software . anyway , it is not necessary to compile the source files , which you can always do .
please make sure that the directory / usr / share / cd exists and that you have write permission ( eg ; by trying to copy something inside it ) .
the first section covers the basic setup of &amp; k@@ audio@@ .sys ; something that is probably just done once and
the second section describes how to proceed to read a &amp; CD ; what needs to be repeated for each read @-@ out &amp; CD ;
here we determine the encoder for compression of the music ( l@@ ame ) as well as the audio format ( MP3 ) as well as the resulting sound quality ( --@@ pres@@ et extreme = &gt; V@@ BR 224 to 256 k@@ bps ) . since we are la@@ zy , we share the program to download the fre@@ ed@@ b to download the CD ; data from the internet .
although we can change these settings at any time , we will probably not change it every time you read a &amp; CD ; change once the appropriate settings are found .
the device name is passed to the reader program to read the &amp; CD ; data / pieces .
often / dev / c@@ drom is a symbolic link to the real device name of your drive . if this does not work or if more than one &amp; CD ; / DVD drive is present , a look into the file / etc / f@@ stab and an attempt with the existing entries of device names for the &amp; CD @-@ ROM ; and / or DVD drives .
the board map General Settings . there is not much to do here . here , an additional conversion can be defined . in our example , everything is left as animated / entered as shown in the scre@@ enshot .
only select in case of incomplete information , so that you will be informed when information on creating keywords ( tags ) is missing .
the card card CD ; -@@ Settings . simply select both entries . we are comfortable and let the &amp; CD ; download data automatically via the Internet from a fre@@ ed@@ b computer .
note : the computer must be connected to the fre@@ ed@@ b server while reading the &amp; CD ; it must be connected to the internet .
the second selection field is simpler , becomes a &amp; CD ; record is found , immediately starts reading the &amp; CD ; this is associated with low risk , if you are later un@@ happy with the database entry and the resulting directory names / fil@@ en@@ ames or tag entries , they can easily be changed and the ID@@ 3 tags with K@@ id@@ 3 , the &amp; k@@ de ; Tag@@ ger .
apart from this example , please keep in mind : if you want to enter everything manually , de@@ activate the selection fields and fre@@ ed@@ b will not be used . however , you can use fre@@ ed@@ b locally in offline mode if you want to download the database first . however , if you want to use fre@@ ed@@ b in offline mode , the two selection fields must be selected , at least the first . the mode is set up on the following card map .
CD@@ DB is fre@@ ed@@ b for us . these are settings for data request , for retri@@ eving the &amp; CD ; information from the fre@@ ed@@ b server over the Internet . how does the system know which data to get the CD ? read the section on fre@@ ed@@ b . set it all the way it is shown in the scre@@ enshot .
mode : we did not download the database , we only want to work with the remote database on the Internet server .
CD@@ DB Server : please go to fre@@ ed@@ b@@ .org and look for a mirror server near you . on this way the load is distributed between the hosts , but this setting will work first .
both work equally as far as the server is concerned , but as many fire@@ walls are using the protocol 88@@ 80 by default , there might be more luck with the protocol 80 , because the HTTP protocol is usually open to surf on the internet .
in this example we do not want to transfer data to the fre@@ ed@@ b server . de@@ activate the first check box should suff@@ ice .
simply take the settings from the scre@@ enshot . ( make sure the folder / tmp exists on your computer )
number of simultaneous songs : sorry , there is one reason why more than one at the same time with only one existing drive ? parallel reading and coding ? the author does not know , therefore simply try it yourself .
CD ; disc@@ ard after reading the last piece : tick this to disc@@ ard the &amp; CD ; at the end of the process .
custom Fol@@ der for Temp@@ orary Files : if you tick this , then / must be specified the path / folder in which the wa@@ v files are stored . if the field is not crossed , the files will be created in the private folder . do not forget this folder if you want to do something with the wa@@ v files .
enter everything as it is on the scre@@ enshot . the command is a bit long , under certain circumstances something must be fl@@ atten@@ ed to the right to see it all .
&apos;@@ --@@ pres@@ et extreme &apos; defines the audio quality of MP@@ 3s . as mentioned earlier , this is a setting for very good audio quality , even for very good hi @-@ fi stereo systems . the resulting amount of compression is about 224 to 256 k@@ p@@ bs . the achieved compression factor is 6.3 . this is a good balance between audio quality and memory consumption .
note the entry &apos; --@@ id@@ 3@@ v@@ 1 @-@ only &apos; for restri@@ cting the creation of tags to version V1 / V@@ 1.@@ 1. &apos; ID@@ 3@@ v2 tags can be deleted if necessary ; in case of a later change of tags . % f and % o are internal variables for the name of the input file ( including the full path ) and the output file ( including the full path ) .
set the rest as shown in the scre@@ enshot . some comments for future use outside this example :
number of WAV files to be enco@@ ded simultaneously : with a Du@@ al@@ core or Quad@@ core or even a multi@@ processor machine , you can attempt to en@@ code more than one wa@@ v file at the same time .
that &apos;s it , we just finished the basic setup of &amp; k@@ audio@@ files ; this configuration is used as standard for each reading of a &amp; CD ; if you chose the organizational structure of your music wis@@ ely , you never need to change it again .
this section describes how the process of reading the &amp; CD ; runs on disk . we will create MP3 files . the folder structure , the way the music is organized on the hard disk , was described in the previous section . first , a connection to the Internet is established , as we are comfortable and the &amp; CD ; the process described in this section must be repeated for each read @-@ out &amp; CD ;
since we use a &amp; CD , which is not yet contained in fre@@ ed@@ b , the scre@@ en@@ shots look a bit different from the data collected for a &amp; CD ; therefore , you will learn the &amp; CD ; manually insert data instead of fet@@ ching them from the Internet . comments will point to the differences .
try not the &amp; CD ; this example can be found . it &apos;s a &apos; special &apos; output of the author of this manual .
if this hasn &apos;t happened yet , then the &amp; CD has to be pushed into the drive that was defined in the main window .
after a brief moment the pieces and their length should be listed in the window , as shown in the scre@@ enshot . this only if the &amp; CD ; as audio CD ; could be identified and read by c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia .
if this is not done , go to the Ques@@ tions and Ans@@ wers section for help or go back to the previous section concerning basic settings .
attention : if the CD has been successfully retri@@ eved from the fre@@ ed@@ b , all titles of the pieces are already filled and the name of the artist and the album will be displayed .
in the event that there is more than one entry in the database with the &apos; unique &apos; &amp; CD ; key for your &amp; CD ; there is a window appears and you can select the database entry that suits your opinion best to your &amp; CD ;
if you have not selected the check box for automatic retri@@ eval of fre@@ ed@@ b ( on the page &amp; CD ; settings in the dialog for the settings ) , you can also trigger this manually by selecting the first button in the tool@@ bar . if you do not have a local database , but fetch the data from the Internet , you will need the connection to the Internet .
e 1.2 Step 02 : the CD Editor - entering the CD data and the title of the first piece
enter the data for your &amp; CD ; according to the pattern on the next screen shot . the title of the piece in the first line of the input title &apos; Current Title &apos; , the rest of the data in the input field &apos; Album &apos; .
the artist no longer has to be entered in the input field &apos; Current Title &apos; unless you have a compilation with different artists for each piece .
the comment field below can be used for each comment ini@@ di@@ vidu@@ al per piece , the comment field of the album is used for comments that apply together for all pieces of the CD .
attention : after the successful retri@@ eval of the data from the fre@@ ed@@ b the CD editor is not empty , but it already contains the data as shown in the following scre@@ enshot . however , it is always a good idea to check the content of the CD editor so that you do not only start with the artist and album name ( e.g. whether all words start with upper@@ case letters or not ... ) , but also to check if there are any unwanted comments .
note : in this example we use only ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 1 tags . this limits the length of the fields to 30 characters for the artist , album and title of a piece and only 28 characters for the comment section . if you use ID@@ 3@@ v2 tags , you have unlimited field length , at least on what &amp; k@@ audio@@ .sys . this option is set on the encoding settings tab .
you can change the tag information of the generated files later anytime with tag editor . K@@ id@@ 3 is a good tool for MP3 files , with it you can also recre@@ ate ID@@ 3@@ v2 tags .
Tags are not supported by all enco@@ ders and file formats . see the help of the encoder to get more information .
simply select an entry that obviously matches the style of the read @-@ out CD ; in this example , this is not important as we don &apos;t give the &amp; CD ; data anyway . for more information go to fre@@ ed@@ b@@ .org website and read the information about the categories . pop or R@@ ap for example can be found under Rock .
after choosing &apos; OK &apos; you come back to the main window . just click on the line with the second piece .
the CD editor window appears again and you see that the fields for the album are already filled with the entered data we have recorded for the first piece . simply enter the entries for the fields of the current piece . the title of the piece will definitely and other information you want .
click on the next line in the main window and proceed in the same way until you have entered all the title data of the &amp; CD ;
attention : this window does not appear when you downloaded the data from the fre@@ ed@@ b . it is already sorted into one of these categories of the database .
it is the third button of the tool@@ bar . note that the artist and the album are displayed above the parts list .
note that there is a check mark in front of each line of a piece . only the titles that are selected are read out . just make sure all the pieces are selected , or press the All Pi@@ eces button at the bottom of the screen to select all the pieces at once .
if you start selecting the selection process by clicking on the selection process , this window will appear for confirmation . click OK and then we will take a look at the window with the orders and follow what is running out .
click on the tab order to switch to the order window . it is in the left upper half of the window , directly beneath the buttons of the tool@@ bar .
this is the window to check the orders . the first piece is just read on the hard drive . the status of the program is displayed in the left lower part of the window in the status line .
you will see this error message if you try to work with a encoder that you have not yet installed . pieces not successfully enco@@ ded are marked with a red &apos; X &apos; in the order list .
by the way , the folder for the T@@ MP file and the target folder are not what we have entered here in the example . have you checked if you have write access to the folders for the temporary files and the destination folder ? ; - )
now it is clear why the error occurred directly after the end of the reading of the first piece .
the order 1 reads the first piece , it is finished . but we have a new entry : order 4 is the encoding of pieces 1 into the format MP3 . thus , read out and coding in parallel . note the status message in the lower part of the window , it is now improved .
the author of the program has not found a configuration setting to supp@@ ress this behavior . the only thing that seems configur@@ able is the number of parallel processes for reading and coding . with low @-@ performance machines , the result is un@@ clear . the computer with a AM@@ D@@ 64 does not seem to have a problem with simultaneous reading and coding ( of course two different pieces ) .
now the last song is read while another piece is enco@@ ded and a third order is placed in the queu@@ e of the encoder . after the last piece is enco@@ ded , a small window is displayed with a message for a short time in the upper left part of the window .
for the successful use of &amp; k@@ audio@@ .sys ; , you need &amp; k@@ de ; 3.@@ x@@ . res@@ p . 4.@@ x and c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia . if you want to produce compressed audio files such as MP3 or OGG , you will need the encoder of your choice .
&amp; k@@ audio@@ .sys ; is used today within the &amp; k@@ de ; CV@@ S as part of the k@@ de@@ multimedia package . however , most distri@@ butions contain already pre @-@ compiled package , da &amp; k@@ audio@@ .sys , part of an important &amp; quot ; package . if you read this , you probably already did it ...
this section is aimed at people comp@@ iling from source files , and not intended for users who use a pre @-@ compiled package of their distribution .
if you are looking for help like the program can be adapted to your needs once it runs , then the following is right for you :
a program that calls a lot of different programs has many different options . it is best to read the step by step example to get to know the options and settings . it displays screen shots of the different cards of the settings and also contains comments for options which are not used in the example .
Hello , still am reading ? even if only the help menu was cli@@ cked after the first start of the program , without any cl@@ ue like it should go on from this somehow empty screen ( especially if there is no audio CD at the time of the program start ; in the drive ) , or from an un@@ usually short menu ?
what is it about ? who reads this , probably already started the program . it should look something like this :
a bad example : unfortunately no e @-@ mail . the author can &apos;t keep this hand@@ book . it &apos;s the first version for a hand@@ book to &amp; k@@ audio@@ .sys files . whoever wants to add or change anything useful , may it . at least only after the contact with the author . and if you read this , he has left this section and therefore agre@@ es with this suggestion .
strange if you managed to get the source file from the &amp; quot ; SV@@ N , then you don &apos;t need these information , but ...
&amp; k@@ mid ; is the MI@@ DI@@ - and Kara@@ oke Player by &amp; k@@ de ; . besides others it has some features with real @-@ time graphics and kar@@ a@@ oke real time recording of texts also some features that other &amp; UNIX and MIDI players do not have .
&amp; k@@ mid ; runs under &amp; Linux ; and FreeBSD . it builds on the O@@ SS system , so it should work on all systems with O@@ SS and &amp; quot ; support . &amp; k@@ mid ; also supports the &amp; Linux ; Ultr@@ as@@ ound project driver needed for G@@ US cards . al@@ sa is included as soon as it supports a Sequ@@ encer .
&amp; k@@ mid ; shows the lyrics on the screen with changing color , so it &apos;s easy to follow the piece .
graphical representation of the activity of each MIDI channel by high@@ lighting the pressed keys on the ( virtual ) keyboard .
drag &amp; Drop so that you can drag and drop any MIDI file from a &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; window to k@@ mid .
supports the two existing standards to store text in MIDI files ( song events or text events ) . k@@ mid automatically determines the used procedure .
session support . when you finish off ; while playing a song , k@@ mid will start again with the same song again next time .
supports external MIDI synthes@@ iz@@ ers , A@@ WE , FM and G@@ US cards ( for the latter you need the L@@ up driver and g@@ us@@ d ) .
first , you can select Open ... from the File menu . it appears the usual file dialog with which you can select the desired song .
you can also drop a file from a &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; window to the &amp; k@@ mid ; window . this also works with multiple songs at the same time .
to play a piece of music , open it and press the Play button in the tool@@ bar , select the play from the menu item or press the space bar .
please note that &amp; k@@ mid ; a piece automatically starts when you drag it onto the &amp; k@@ mid ; window . ( in several pieces , they are added to a collection and then played back after each other . )
once &amp; k@@ mid , play a piece , you can jump to any place by using the middle mouse button and go back and forth with the regulator .
if you find that a song is played too fast or too slow , you can click on the left and right of the template and so change the playing speed . to get back the original tempo , double click the Tem@@ po@@ - LCD .
the space bar has two tasks : when a piece is played , a pressure on the space bar acts like a pressure on the pause button or selecting the menu entry pause in the menu , so interrup@@ ts playback . press the space bar while no piece is played , starts &amp; k@@ mid ; playback .
lyrics can be saved in two ways in one piece of music . some pieces use text event , others use lyrics and others both . some pieces don &apos;t have any text : - )
in &amp; k@@ mid ; you can specify what events are to be displayed and even better : the event type is automatically determined using a song so that you do not have to manually set the kar@@ a@@ oke text . however , you still have the option to change this if you want to see the other way .
if you want to set a type of event , select the entries for text events and / or rec@@ umbent events from the Settings menu . the same function also includes keys 1 and 2 .
a collection is a list of MIDI files that you summar@@ ize . these are played in turn after . in this section you will find how to use collections efficiently .
to create a collection , first open the collection manager . you can find it in the menu collection under the item Organ@@ ize .... Click here on New and enter the name for the collection .
you can also copy an existing collection by clicking on copy and then speci@@ fying the name for the new collection . in the beginning , this collection will contain the same songs as the original .
if you have more than one collection , you can set the desired items in the collection manager .
the temporary collection includes all the songs you want to add to any other collection .
when leaving the application , this collection will not be saved . remember , if you add a lot of pieces .
to add songs to a collection , it must be selected in the collection manager . there , you can add a song using the Add button . it will again appear the file dialog with which you can select the desired song .
a second method to add a song depends on setting Automatic Ad@@ ding to the collection .
when automatic addition to the collection is enabled , a piece is automatically added to the active collection when opening ( using file Open or Dra@@ g &amp; Drop ) .
if Automati@@ cally add to the collection is not enabled , the temporary collection will be activated and emp@@ tied when a piece is opened . this collection will then be added to the remaining pieces .
to remove a song from a collection , you need to open the collection manager , select the collection and the desired song and then click Rem@@ ove .
you can select the order in which the songs are played . if you select the sequence from the sub@@ menu sequence of the menu collections , the songs will be played in the order as they were added to the collection .
if you add or remove songs or select random order in the menu , the order is re@@ defined .
to play a song , select it in the collection manager , or use the selection list above the kar@@ a@@ oke text .
to jump a song , select Next song , next song from the menu item or press the arrow to the right .
to jump back a song , select the Previous piece button , record Previous piece from the menu item or press the arrow to the left .
to delete a collection , open the collection manager , select the collection to be deleted and click the Del@@ ete button .
the temporary collection cannot be deleted . however , this does not matter because it is not stored when leaving &amp; k@@ mid .
this is absolutely necessary for synthes@@ iz@@ ers who are not General MIDI @-@ capable . in this case , the MIDI Map transl@@ ates General MIDI events into events that the synthes@@ izer understands .
for example , you can create a MIDI map that converts all the events of the Change Patch to B@@ right Piano in Events of the Change Patch to Tr@@ ump@@ et type and will always sound a trumpet if originally a piano should play .
if you only have one sound card , you don &apos;t need a MIDI map because all sound cards GM are compatible ( incl . A@@ WE - and G@@ US cards , FM devices and so on ) .
there are no programs to create MIDI maps , so you have to edit the corresponding file by hand ( with your favorite editor ) .
a MIDI Map is a text file that stores all the necessary settings for playing a piece .
each section may appear only once , except the key@@ map section , which may appear as often as desired . however , prerequisite for this is that each occurrence has a different tex@@ ti@@ d ( see below ) .
Def@@ ine PAT@@ CH@@ MAP ... EN@@ D Def@@ ine Key@@ map &quot; Name of the Key@@ map ... &quot; EN@@ D Def@@ ine Key@@ map &quot; An@@ other key@@ map ... &quot; EN@@ D Def@@ ine CHAN@@ N@@ EL@@ MAP ... EN@@ D OP@@ TION@@ S ... EN@@ D
you see that Def@@ ine is needed to indicate that a section starts ( except OP@@ TION@@ S ) and EN@@ D that the end of a section is reached .
please send me your map file as email so that I can offer in future versions of &amp; k@@ mid ; support can be for devices that are not General MIDI compatible .
this section describes how General MIDI &apos;s patches are m@@ apped to your specific keyboard . the general use looks as follows :
please note that the left side of the equ@@ ation mark is ignored . it is assumed that the GM @-@ patches are in the correct order ( from 0 to 127 ) , so you can &apos;t change the order and don &apos;t om@@ it any line for one of the 128 tools .
the optional all @-@ key@@ s@@ To M is needed to put all tones that this instrument need to put on the tone with the number M . if your keyboard does not support a firing signal ( GM Patch 127 ) , you can take a drum ( e.g. with Ton 60 ) , which sounds similar to a gun shot . add the following to the PAT@@ CH@@ MAP section :
so if a MIDI file should now play a note with Patch 127 ( gun shot ) , it takes patch 100 ( the drum on your keyboard ) and plays the sound 60 , regardless of which tone is in the MIDI file .
please note that here with the term drum patch the patch is meant , where each tone represents another percussion instrument ( drum , cy@@ mb@@ als , mar@@ ac@@ as &amp; etc . ) and not the one where the sound equ@@ als the pitch of the always identical drum ( like some key@@ boards ) .
the Key@@ map section is used to specify how tones are m@@ apped on a particular channel or instrument . the use is :
as with the PAT@@ CH@@ MAP section , the sequence of rows is very important , as is its presence . thus , you must create 128 entries .
you can define several key@@ maps for each channel and each instrument . you only have to use different names in the first line .
key@@ maps are mainly used to map tones to the perc@@ us@@ sions channel . take a look at the included key@@ maps .
this section can be used to map some channels to others . for example , if you want to s@@ wap the first and second channels , just make it in the CHAN@@ N@@ EL@@ MAP section .
however , these settings are more useful for key@@ boards who have the percussion on a particular channel ( General MIDI on Channel 10 , others need channels 16 or 9 ) .
Midi devices need 16 channels , the CHAN@@ N@@ EL@@ MAP section has 16 lines , numbered from 0 to 15 , built according to the following pattern :
N is the channel that is pic@@ tured on the channel N . if you use the key@@ map option , the key map with the name name for this channel will need to be defined . if you use the For@@ ce@@ Patch option , all occur@@ ren@@ ces will be ignored to change the patch on this channel . in this case , patch x will always be used .
the For@@ ce@@ Patch option can be useful , for example , to always use the Per@@ cus@@ sions patch on the Per@@ cus@@ sions channel .
the value for P@@ itch@@ Ben@@ der@@ R@@ atio indicates in which ratio P@@ itch @-@ B@@ ender events are multip@@ lied . so if a MIDI file sends a pitch @-@ ending event with the value n , this is converted to the formula n * ( r / 40@@ 96 ) and then passed . the value 40@@ 96 is used to prevent dec@@ im@@ al comm@@ as in the map file .
this setting is needed because GM shows that a keyboard , which is supposed to play a pitch bend event with the value 40@@ 96 , should play a tone higher . unfortunately , however , try some key@@ boards to play two tones up to one oc@@ tave up . to find the right value on your keyboard , you have to try a bit with &amp; k@@ mid .
to use a MIDI map , simply open the MIDI settings dialog . you can find them in the menu under Settings , Point MIDI settings
the channel view is a window with a whole set of key@@ boards ( one for each MIDI channel ) . on these key@@ boards you see which sounds are being played right now .
you can also use the channel view to change the instrument on a particular channel . for each channel there is a selection list where you can select an instrument . if you have changed an instrument , the button doesn &apos;t turn green anymore but red to indicate that no longer the original instrument is used .
the channel view has two different views ( until now ) two different views to display the played notes . in the Settings menu , select the channel view : settings
the speed LCD shows the speed with which a song is played . the higher the number , the greater the speed .
for example , if you find a song too fast to follow the text , you can slow down it . to change the tempo , use the arrows left and right of the LCD .
a MIDI file is a file containing information about how to play a piece of music . it contains the notes , rhythm , speed , &amp; etc ; . thus , the same MIDI file can lead to very different results on two different devices , just like two different musicians can play the same notes in very different ways .
good , I can &apos;t force anyone to use &amp; k@@ mid ; but a typical MIDI file needs about 50 Kb , while an mp3 @-@ file needs 4 MB ( a compression ratio of 1 : 80 ) and with a good synthes@@ izer , you can also change the individual instruments , speed &amp; etc . you have control over everything .
this can happen if you have a binary distribution ( rpm , de@@ b ) of &amp; k@@ mid ; that happens because &amp; k@@ mid ; without A@@ WE support compiled . to eliminate the problem you need to download and install a source distribution ( e.g. from k@@ mid ; &apos;s start page )
I want to add a whole folder to a collection , but I don &apos;t want to add all files individually .
accept , therefore , &amp; k@@ mid ; drag &amp; drop . simply open the folder that you want to add to &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; , select all the files , and drag them to the &amp; k@@ mid ; window .
first , enable auto @-@ adding to the collection previously . otherwise , the files will be added to the temporary collection .
you can press the arrow key on the left of the Tem@@ po@@ - LCD to slow playback . to restore the default speed you can double @-@ click on the LCD .
I have open on a &amp; quot ; Desktop , &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ window with my MIDI folder and &amp; k@@ mid ; on this desktop ( if I play a MIDI file ) or attached ( if I want to play a kar@@ a@@ oke file ) . in this way , I have to switch to the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; window and drag the file to the &amp; k@@ mid window .
if you just want to quickly listen to a file without adding them to a collection , turn off automatic adding to the collection , and the new ; file will be added to the temporary collection .
suppose you have the MIDI files A.@@ mid , B.@@ mid and C.@@ mid@@ . First you just want to play the first file . so , set Automatic Ad@@ ding to the collection and open A.@@ mid@@ . your temporary collection then contains exactly this one MIDI file .
then you decide to play B.@@ mid and C.@@ mid and create a collection of all three files . how do you do that ?
these people sent me MIDI files or postcards . thank you very much ! if I listen to these songs or see the postcard , I encourage you to continue programming .

if you send me a postcard or a MI@@ DI@@ - / Kara@@ oke file from a local group . if you send me a postcard or a MIDI file , I will count among friends of &amp; k@@ mid ; if you want to send me a MIDI file , you should contact me as I may already have the file .
I have written &amp; k@@ mid ; written entirely in my spare time and won money from anyone . I would like to emphasize that I &apos;m just talking to progra@@ m@@ miere because / when I get feedback from users ( postcards or emails ) .
Tak@@ ashi I@@ wa@@ i and Joseph H. Büh@@ ler - corrected the defect that the pitch of A@@ WE cards was too high .
thanks also to Jose L@@ us San@@ che@@ z for testing the G@@ US support , Ign@@ acio Gar@@ cia for testing the A@@ WE support , H@@ as Pet@@ ter Bi@@ ek@@ er , O@@ la Sig@@ ur@@ d@@ son , Marc Di@@ ef@@ en@@ bruch , Peter Gr@@ it@@ sch , Peter @-@ Paul Wilson , Thor@@ sten Wes@@ thei@@ der , Ulrich Cor@@ des and anyone who sent me a patch , error noti@@ fications or just a supp@@ or@@ tive email .
and of course , thanks to all these excellent musicians on the net , who give us these wonderful MI@@ DI@@ - and kar@@ a@@ oke files .
in addition to this , &amp; k@@ mid can be found on its homepage , which is located at htt@@ p : / / www.@@ ar@@ rak@@ is@@ .@@ es / ~ r@@ lar@@ rosa / k@@ mid@@ .@@ html . on the homepage you can follow the development , search for information and view pictures . you will also find there links to pages with other kar@@ a@@ oke songs , &amp; etc ;
a sound card . I recommend you a good sound card or an external synthes@@ izer , since the sound quality depends essentially on your sound card . it &apos;s not the same if you are using an FM radio device or an A@@ WE @-@ card .
if you do not have a sound card , you will need to compile &amp; k@@ mid ; with the MO@@ DE _ DE@@ MO _ ON@@ LY@@ ME@@ U@@ AL parameter , it works as if you had a sound card , except that you can of course not hear music .
if you encounter problems , contact one of the &amp; k@@ de ; mailing lists or send an error message directly to me .
&amp; K@@ MP@@ layer ; is a simple user interface for MP@@ layer , Phon@@ o and ff@@ m@@ peg . the program is used to play video files of formats supported by MP@@ layer or phon@@ on formats , as well as playback of DVD s , VCD s or TV and camera .
the documentation for &amp; k@@ app@@ name ; has not yet been finished as &amp; k@@ de ; installed on this computer .
for additional help please check the page The K@@ DE website to new versions , or send the question to The &amp; k@@ de ; User Mail@@ ing list .
the application window is made of so @-@ called and@@ o@@ ck@@ able windows . there is always a window with the central view . optionally , there is the window with the playlist . and finally , there is a window with the playlist .
it is possible to save Favor@@ ites from the Favor@@ ites menu , but these are single entries . if you want to create a list of entries that are played after each other , you should use the category Defin@@ i@@ tive Play@@ list .
of course , you can add groups to groups to get an extra hierarch@@ ical level . if you balance an entry , its group and all its sub@@ groups are copied to the current category and playback begins with the cli@@ cked entry .
the categories &apos; current play &apos; , TV and permanent playlist can also be changed by editing the XML configuration files . of course , you can only do this if &amp; K@@ MP@@ layer ; the various files in directory ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / K@@ MP@@ layer can be selected from the View menu and next edit mode . by clicking a sub@@ group , only the XML content of this part is displayed .
after changing XML files , you have to choose play@@ lists from the menu and select either the edit mode , or select another category .
all changes are lost when editing mode or selecting another group without matching the playlist .
as a result of the ease of the author of &amp; K@@ MP@@ layer , some functions can only be turned on by changing the XML configuration files .
the animation of starting and ending can be disabled by editing ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / k@@ m@@ play@@ err@@ c and modify &#91; General Options &#93; No In@@ tro = 0 above option to &apos; 1 &apos; . if the option is not present , it can be easily inserted .
it is also possible to activate another animation . &amp; K@@ MP@@ layer ; will note the files ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / K@@ MP@@ layer / sol@@ .x@@ ml and ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / K@@ MP@@ layer / ex@@ it@@ .x@@ ml . the format must be a supported XML file .
the animation during start doesn &apos;t need to be short , it is automatically termin@@ ated by opening another source . this would be anno@@ ying at the end animation but the user can end the application a second time .
a simple example of a start animation may be the display of a favorite photos : &amp; lt ; sm@@ il@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; body@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; im@@ g dur = &quot; in@@ State / K@@ oos / m@@ um@@ .@@ gi@@ f &quot; fit = &quot; meet ; &amp; lt ; / sm@@ il@@ gt ; In directory tests / some examples of S@@ MI@@ L ; supported by &amp; K@@ MP@@ layer ;
there is a tab for the configuration of MP@@ layer in the configuration dialog by &amp; K@@ MP@@ layer ; here , the path from the MP@@ layer and the buffer size of the data stream from the network and other things can be set .
another tool for troubleshooting is the button &apos; console &apos; in the tool@@ bar of K@@ MP@@ layer . here is the output of m@@ player visible .
there is no tab for this playback device in the Con@@ figuration dialog by &amp; K@@ MP@@ layer ; everything must be configured by manual editing of the file ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / k@@ m@@ play@@ err@@ c , such as setting the back@@ end via mim@@ et@@ ype . here &apos;s an example of how a &apos; flash &apos; is played with the sw@@ f@@ de@@ c @-@ mo@@ z@@ illa module :
&apos;@@ Flash &apos; can be played inside &amp; K@@ MP@@ layer ; it can even include the special field em@@ bed for YouTube in the playlist XML .
to allow the &amp; K@@ MP@@ layer ; &apos; flash &apos; to play in HTML pages , the &amp; K@@ MP@@ layer ; module must be specified as a service provider for the M@@ ime type application / x @-@ sho@@ ck@@ wave @-@ flash in the setup dialog file As@@ sign@@ ments of K@@ DE .
the Kon@@ quer@@ or or &amp; K@@ MP@@ layer ; can be started in a console application and search for error messages related to loading the browser module library . if no errors occur here , the back@@ end output is within &amp; K@@ MP@@ layer ; ( view , console , or console from the context menu ) .
in order to always use a pre@@ defined back@@ end for a certain M@@ ime type ( of course only if this was also determined ) , this must be done by manual changing the ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / k@@ m@@ play@@ err@@ c file . for example , phon@@ on should play all og@@ g files :
&amp; K@@ MP@@ layer ; can play from TV cards , either using MP@@ layer or X@@ Video ( this needs k@@ x@@ v@@ player ) . before TV can be looked , the device and the TV channels must be configured . for this , the scanner can be used from the configuration dialog , or the configuration file can be edited manually .
to configure the V@@ DR ( Video Data Recorder ) settings in the K@@ MP@@ layer , the dialog is to be used in the settings under - &gt; Qu@@ el@@ le@@ - &gt; V@@ DR@@ - &gt; X@@ Video port . there should be detected ports from which one is selected . the encoding to be used must be found ( e.g. it is PAL for West Europe ) , the correct name probably has a dv@@ b included in it .
since the V@@ DR support of K@@ MP@@ layer can only use X@@ Video , X@@ Video should also work ( probably this way of playing video equipment under Linux is the only one that works ) . for this reason , the vide@@ o@@ for@@ lin@@ ux extension for the X server must be functional . for the X@@ Free@@ 86 server it must be included in its configuration file ( / etc / X11 / X@@ F@@ 86@@ Con@@ fig ) :
internally , various names are used by K@@ MP@@ layer for the sources . at the time of the emergence of this documentation , this is dv@@ d@@ nav@@ al , dv@@ d@@ source , ex@@ it@@ source , intro@@ vert , pi@@ p@@ es@@ our@@ ce , t@@ v@@ scanner , TV@@ Source , ur@@ l@@ source , v@@ c@@ d@@ source and v@@ dr@@ source .
is there any advice on how to make my CD@@ ROM drive more silent when I play from it ( not from the VCD : / / ) ?
yes , the h@@ d@@ par@@ m -@@ E 8 / dev / c@@ drom command is to be run as root after mounting the device . it is important to make sure that / dev / c@@ drom is on the CD@@ ROM drive .
x@@ ine only starts slowly , why does each time my CPU need to be checked for its performance ?
note : the answer is over@@ hau@@ led . k@@ x@@ ine@@ player automatically needs the last saved value , only the first time x@@ ine will check the CPU .

Q@@ T ; : &amp; Q@@ t ; is a C + + library for creating graphical user interfaces and network support and is needed to compile &amp; k@@ ile ;
latex ; : a professional writing application . Unix @-@ like systems are likely to be used on the package &amp; tex@@ live ; res@@ p . &amp; tet@@ ex ; ( for older systems ) .
most of these components can be included in the &amp; Linux ; distribution . for installation , the documentation of the distribution or installation CD ; / DVD should be used .
the &amp; k@@ ile ; -@@ project contains some pre @-@ compiled packages from &amp; k@@ ile ; for different distri@@ butions . they enable easy installation without further comp@@ iling and are included on the k@@ ile ; website .
this manual is for everyone - regardless of experience with &amp; latex ; , &amp; k@@ de ; , &amp; k@@ ile ; or &amp; Linux ; .
advanced users do not have to read this manual . however , all suggestions for documentation are taken into account . if the support for this project or its documentation is desired , the contact should be made via the k@@ ile ; website .
if questions arise , or when comp@@ iling from &amp; k@@ ile ; on or if extensions are requested , this should be addressed at the k@@ ile @-@ de@@ vel @ list@@ s.@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net mailing list .
&amp; k@@ ile ; is an integrated &amp; latex ; environment for the &amp; k@@ de ; desktop . &amp; k@@ ile ; offers the possibility to use all &amp; latex ; functions in a graphical interface and within this one easy , direct and customized access to all &amp; latex ; -@@ programs . in conclusion , the easy @-@ to @-@ use assistant , the &amp; latex ; -@@ reference and the powerful project management .
to learn more about &amp; kate , the manual should be used for K@@ ate . users of &amp; k@@ ile ; can start working there directly with reading the chapter working with the editor of &amp; kate .
for &amp; latex ; is the right language : L@@ ay @-@ TECH . while the original and tex ; difficult to use , a lay@@ man ( engl@@ . lay ) &amp; latex ; -@@ mac@@ ros can also be used . a less demanding but realistic explanation is that it is derived from the sur@@ name of Les@@ lie La mp@@ ort .
while here only a good overview of &amp; latex ; given , it is not the ultimate book to do so . to be able to master good books , good books should be e.g. H. Kop@@ ka / P. W. D@@ aly , A Guide to &amp; latex ; : document Prepar@@ ation for Beg@@ inners and Advanced Users , 3rd Edition , 1999 da@@ for .
just like other mark@@ up languages , and latex ; an introduction to which the general characteristics such as paper format , page number@@ ing and text size are specified as well as a body with the text . the introduction contains at least the command \ \ docum@@ ent@@ class , the body starts with the instruction \ \ begin { document } and must be closed again with the command \ \ end { document } .
quick entry wiz@@ ard by &amp; k@@ ile ; is a useful function for fast creation of a document in &amp; k@@ ile ; the selection of the wiz@@ ard ( Men@@ Ã ¼ ) offers some options for creating the document . it can also be done some settings related to the document .
document Cl@@ asses : this defines the type of document to be created : article ( article ) , book &#91; book &#93; , Letter &#91; letter &#93; , Report &#91; sc@@ r@@ re@@ pr@@ t &#93; , Report ( DIN ) &#91; sc@@ r@@ re@@ pr@@ t &#93; , Buch ( DIN ) &#91; sc@@ r@@ re@@ pr@@ t &#93; , Projec@@ tor &#91; Be@@ amer &#93; , Foil &#91; prosp@@ er &#93; or custom .
encoding : this sets the character encoding . it should use the character encoding of the system . modern systems increasingly use the UT@@ F @-@ 8 encoding as default . at best , UT@@ F @-@ 8@@ X should be used ( for correct processing of the &amp; latex ; documents ) .
this list contains the most commonly used add @-@ on packs for &amp; latex ; for inclusion , they only have to be balanced in the check box .
article ( DIN ) , book ( DIN ) , report ( DIN ) , letter ( DIN ) : the document classes of KO@@ MA @-@ Script ( to comply with German DIN regulations ) .
new users now have no need to worry . it is only a brief description of the functions and further information is given in the section .
&amp; k@@ ile ; offers - just like other source editors - high@@ lighting the used commands , settings and elements ( as well as un@@ suitable ) . by &amp; k@@ ile , it is most likely that any mathematical environment has not been closed . however , you will see it spar@@ ed by the modest appearance of the output file . however , it will save you time and trouble .
when entering a new command ( e.g. \ \ begin { command } ) by &amp; k@@ ile , an empty line ( e.g. \ \ end { command } ) will be created automatically when entering a new command ( e.g. \ \ end { command } ) . this function can be blocked in the menu settings ... La@@ Te@@ X commands are disabled .
all documents are usually divided into some elements . latex ; allows the sub@@ division of the document into the following elements ( part is the highest and sub@@ divided the bottom element ) :
in the view of the document in the structure view , the individual elements can be changed and viewed by a mouse click .
when creating your own &amp; latex ; files the kn@@ itting search can be very helpful . once a DVI ; file &#91; device dependent file ) &#93; was created , jumps &amp; k@@ ile ; by clicking with the middle mouse button in the DVI ; viewer to the corresponding line in &amp; latex ; source code .
a DVI ; file contains a description of the format@@ ted document and also other information such as the font and is besides PDF the usual output types of &amp; tex ; or &amp; latex ; there are many tools for viewing , converting and printing DVI ; files for different systems and devices .
when using the mouse button , the elements of the DVI ; file are linked to the editor and as soon as an element in the DVI ; file has been cli@@ cked , the exact opposite is given . as soon as a section in the &amp; latex ; source text has been cli@@ cked , the corresponding point is ski@@ pped in the DVI ; viewer .
master document : this function is used in working with multiple files . a master document simpli@@ fies work with others .@@ tex files . when using a project , a project @-@ wide master document can be set up project settings .
quick @-@ build : the &amp; latex ; source code is compiled and the result is automatically displayed ( if there are no errors in the source code ) .
file protection : in this mode , the DVI ; file is on the n@@ der@@ ungen@@ .@@ &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and there is no call from &amp; ey@@ epi@@ ece ; after the fast construction . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
when viewing the editing tool@@ bar , the three large selection fields should be located . the selection fields have been developed for fast insertion of common elements into the document . the first selection box is for the quick breakdown of the document into parts , chapters , sections , ... The available &amp; latex ; instructions for division are :
the selection box Other is for inser@@ ting items such as keywords , foot@@ notes or references . the available options are :
name : with this command , a name for a section , a picture or different element is created .
reference : used for reference to a specified designation ( choice of a select field possible ) .
when using quot@@ ation , a selection list with literary input is displayed . at &amp; bi@@ b@@ tex ; this only works if the file belongs to a project . for editing &amp; bi@@ b@@ tex ; files are required corresponding editors . the author has good experiences with &amp; k@@ bi@@ b@@ tex ; and &amp; k@@ bi@@ b ; . the &amp; bi@@ b@@ tex ; files can also be written in &amp; k@@ ile ; by hand .
the last drop @-@ down box with the name Gr@@ Ã ¶ Ã © e is used for setting the characters . it can be specified in the font settings for the main text , the joins notes , etc . , the following type@@ faces are available :
when calling &amp; k@@ ile ; two options are available : 1 . the Wiz@@ ard for creating a new document by selecting the document type and determining the settings . 2 . the document can be written by hand .
the brackets after the command \ \ docum@@ ent@@ class contain the settings for the command . setting &#91; 12@@ pt &#93; speci@@ fies the font size . if the font is not specified at the beginning , this can also be done later in the text .
once the source code above has been entered , the &amp; latex ; source code must be compiled . the easiest way to do this is the use of the menu building or the fast construction button .
the source code must be saved before comp@@ iling . &amp; k@@ ile ; automatically exp@@ ires storage .
if the compilation of the document is missing , it should be looked for in the logging after the errors . if you use quick construction should be started automatically . if this is not the case , the logging should also be taken into account .
an environment ( environment ) is a text that is treated differently from the rest of the document . for example , a report with the font size 12 will be created and only a few columns should have a different type@@ face . the command \ \ begin { environment } , \ \ Hu@@ ge and \ \ end { environment } will then allow the change of the characters within the environment .
the changes are only made within the environment ( from \ \ begin { environment } to \ \ end { environment } ) . there is no limitation ( number ) for the changes within an environment .
there are many options to increase legi@@ bility and ease of use of the document . for example , you can add specific fonts , bold , c@@ rank , sub@@ missions , etc . these commands end either with the command \ \ end or automatically at the end of the environment .
\ \ begin { emp@@ h } : this command is for the siv@@ ity and is long until it is closed with a \ \ end { emp@@ h } or another environment . a single word in a set may be it@@ ali@@ c with \ \ emp@@ h { word } .
\ \ quote : creates a quote in the document . quote starts with \ \ begin { quot@@ a } and ends with \ \ end { quot@@ a } .
after the background for writing the source code with the &amp; latex ; sign language was presented , follows a step @-@ by @-@ step guide for creating a document in &amp; k@@ ile ; .
once a bit of text was entered in the wiz@@ ard , a few adjustments for the better read@@ ability of the document should be made . this should be a quot@@ ation , a few places in fat and ital@@ ics , and a poem to use to see the differences of these commands .
once the document has been viewed , Editor View or C@@ trl @-@ E can be converted back to the editor ( in the internal viewer ) . in an external viewer , the window needs to be closed .
once the DVI ; file has been created , the document can be printed or converted to a &amp; Post@@ Script ; / PDF file . simply try out and have fun .
DVI ; is a device independent file format ( engl . D e V ice I n@@ dependent ) . these files are created by &amp; tex ; or &amp; latex ; for the read@@ ability of some drivers of the computer . there are many different types of .@@ d@@ vi output such as printers , &amp; Post@@ Script ; / PDF converter or computer screens .
for printing a &amp; DVI file , the same steps as for the creation of the document are useful ( see ) . at the 7th step - after clicking on DVI , the document can then be printed by file printing ( in the viewer ) ( if the printer is set correctly ) .
the tool@@ bar allows the conversion of the DVI ; file into other formats . as soon as the DVI ; file was created from the &amp; latex ; source code , the conversion into changed other formats can begin using the buttons in the tool@@ bar .
the pre @-@ selection procedure allows the direct jump from the editor to the associated position within the DVI ; file .
&amp; k@@ ile ; offers a suitable setting for all &amp; latex ; -@@ B@@ inary files . for this , only modern under Settings K@@ ile must be set up ... Tools Building mature .
in order to execute the pre @-@ selection , the mouse poin@@ ter must be cli@@ cked in a line of the source code and then cli@@ cked on pre@@ face search . the jump to the corresponding point in DVI ; viewer is then done .
with this function in &amp; Ey@@ epi@@ ece ; with one click of the middle mouse button in the DVI ; -@@ document the corresponding &amp; latex ; -@@ document by &amp; k@@ ile ; open and ski@@ pped to the corresponding line . to do this , &amp; k@@ ile ; in &amp; Pop@@ ular ; as text editor ( Setup ey@@ epi@@ ece ... Editor )
if there is no error when using the quick build of the &amp; DVI ; viewer , there may be an error . if there is an error , it will be shown in the log file or in the message window .
the log file causes the source code error source . the editor can then use the La@@ Te@@ X errors and latest La@@ Te@@ X errors for jumps between the errors . the log file always indicates the line in which the error appears . to view the faul@@ ty line , the error in the log file must be cli@@ cked and &amp; k@@ ile ; jump to er@@ ron@@ eous line .
once you click on the corresponding button in the tool@@ bar , a window will appear to select the template to be used for the document . the default options are :
when selecting an empty document , a document can either be re@@ written from scratch or the wiz@@ ard can be used to quickly create a new document . more information can be found in the section .
basic users of &amp; latex ; usually use the same introduction for almost all documents . templates can be in &amp; k@@ ile ; created , stored and loaded to facilitate the creation of a new document .
to create a new template , either an existing &amp; tex ; - / latex ; file needs to be opened or a new file created . &amp; k@@ ile ; can create a new template by creating an existing document and selecting a file template ...
when creating a new document from a template using a file New , some strings are replaced by other data ( e.g. name or character encoding ) . these variables can be set up in Settings K@@ ile ... Settings generally set .
when creating the own template , it is therefore necessary to know which strings are replaced by which variables :
$ $ DO@@ CU@@ MEN@@ T@@ CLAS@@ SI@@ P@@ TION@@ S $ $ : this string is replaced by typ@@ ing in document class . typically it is used as follows : \ \ docum@@ ent@@ class &#91; $ $ DO@@ CU@@ MEN@@ T@@ CLAS@@ SI@@ C@@ TION@@ S $ $ &#93; { article } .
the easiest way to create a template is to use the wiz@@ ard and the associated entry of the commands in the editor . once the document has been created in this way , the following steps must be completed :
when creating a new document , you can then select your own template instead of the standard ones .
a template can be created from any &amp; latex ; files created . a simple way to create a template should be searched for one on the Internet and the steps described below are searched .
&amp; k@@ ile ; used &amp; kate ; as an internal editor . &amp; kate ; is a text editor for programm@@ ers with the possibility of reading and making many different types of text files ( including &amp; latex ; and &amp; bi@@ b@@ tex ; ) . many settings for &amp; kate ; can be made directly in menu tools .
to learn more about &amp; kate . and to learn about his options , the K@@ ate manual should be used . users of &amp; k@@ ile can start reading the chapter working with the editor of &amp; kate .
&amp; k@@ ile ; provides a very practical &amp; latex ; command reference which can be called from the La@@ Te@@ X reference help . it contains a detailed description of almost all commands that can be found in &amp; latex ; use as well as their syntax .
a double @-@ click with a dr@@ illed C@@ trl key to select the &amp; tex ; word . this means that when clicking on \ \ par \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ par \ \ par \ \ par is selected .
when drag@@ ging the text with a right mouse button , the selected text is automatically copied to the clip@@ board .
when using the arrow keys with dr@@ illed shift key , parts of the source code can be selected in the editor window .
&amp; k@@ ile ; has the possibility to search for the most different types of source code and emphasize them . for example , the &amp; latex ; -@@ commands from normal text and also the mathematical form@@ ulas are highlighted by another color .
many assist@@ ants can add additional spr@@ ing@@ marks . this is an own kind of book@@ mark within the text . the menu Edit spr@@ ing@@ marks or the corresponding key root make the jump to the next or last spr@@ ing@@ mark . this is also highlighted in the first input of a character .
editing is probably one of the main features when using a program such as &amp; k@@ ile ; although &amp; kate ; already excellent options added in &amp; k@@ ile ; important functions for writing a &amp; latex ; source code added . &amp; latex ; use special commands for their selection . under Edit Select , the following commands for text selection are included :
this includes a complete paragraph ( group of lines containing an empty line on both sides ) . this extended meaning does not include a text with persistent lines ( as in other text editors ) . this extended meaning includes tables , &amp; latex ; -@@ commands and all other lines of the source code . the only explo@@ iting thing in &amp; k@@ ile ; is that the setting is separated by two blank lines .
choose the word under the current cur@@ sor position . this selection also has an extended meaning , as this command also includes &amp; latex ; -@@ commands with a kn@@ itted area ( \ \ ) and an additional star ( * ) at the end .
to delete a part of the document , this can be selected first and removed by pressing the Del@@ ete key . &amp; kate ; provides the key root C@@ trl ; K with which the whole line is removed . &amp; k@@ ile ; offers with its own commands here for a faster possibility . under Edit Rem@@ ove , the following commands are included to delete the text :
removes a complete paragraph . the definition for a paragraph in &amp; k@@ ile ; is included in the description to edit select paragraph .
it has already been clari@@ fied that environments play a central role in &amp; latex ; therefore , offers &amp; k@@ ile ; for more commands under Edit Sur@@ ro@@ undings for a possible simple work with &amp; latex ; .
with this command , jump to the beginning of the current environment ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cur@@ sor is placed directly in front of the command to open the environment .
with this command , jump to the end of the current environment ( no matter where the current position is ) , the cur@@ sor is placed directly behind the command to close the environment .
when the cur@@ sor is in front or inside the command \ \ begin { environment } , spra@@ yed at the end of the environment ( or vice versa ) .
when entering many ne@@ sted environment commands , the overview can be lost quickly . this command will close the last opened environment so that the ne@@ sted environment structure will not be destroyed .
&amp; k@@ ile ; also offers special commands for the &amp; latex ; groups specified by stap@@ les { ... } . under Edit Te@@ X Group are a few important commands that correspond to those from edit environment .
with this command , jump to the beginning of the current group ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cur@@ sor is placed directly in front of the opening bracket .
with this command , jump to the end of the current group ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cur@@ sor is placed directly behind the welded closing clasp .
if the cur@@ sor is in front or behind the f@@ enced bracket of a &amp; tex ; group # is moved to the other end of the group ( or vice versa ) .
when entering many ne@@ sted groups cl@@ amps quickly the view over can be lost . this command completes the last opened group , so that the ne@@ sted structure of the &amp; tex ; groups is not destroyed .
in &amp; latex ; two easy @-@ to @-@ use signs are used as a tag . the sign &quot; for two easy alignment is used . also for the end of the request the sign &quot; is used . &amp; k@@ ile ; knows this case and has two closing label marks for &amp; latex ; one .
this automatic entry of the double check mark can be set up under Settings K@@ ile ... La@@ Te@@ X can be switched on and off .
it can also be used in all languages ( e.g. n@@ german or french ) and there@@ with German or French trademarks . there are also many other languages available .
when pressing Shift , Enter &amp; k@@ ile ; a smart line break . if the current position is within a list environment ( e.g. enum@@ er@@ ate or it@@ em@@ ize ) , &amp; k@@ ile ; not only a line break but also the command \ \ item .
within a spre@@ ad@@ sheet environment , the current line is complete with \ \ \ \ with a complete line break .
even better - &amp; k@@ ile ; is smart enough to support pre @-@ set &amp; latex ; - or user @-@ defined environments . these can be c@@ ile under Settings ... La@@ Te@@ X added .
some users want to arrange the columns in table environments and thereby order all E@@ t characters ( amp ; ) among each other . if this tab is not the necessary tab@@ ulator in the above line . although this tab is not the necessary tab@@ ulator , add &amp; k@@ ile ; add some space for the columns position of the current table .
although &amp; kate ; already offers a good source code complete , this was added in &amp; k@@ ile ; to include special commands ( mostly for &amp; latex ; ) . three of them work as needed and the other two are for automatic execution . all these modes can be set up for different working modes under Settings K@@ ile ... can be adjusted to complete .
when starting a new environment using the command \ \ begin { environment } will be &amp; k@@ ile ; automatically add the command \ \ end { environment } to an empty line ( for the text ) .
when pressing the back button , the last letter of the input will be removed and , possibly , the complete list becomes the complete list . on the other hand , the list may shr@@ ink by entering another letter .
all commands are written with a short description of their parameters . the descriptions are naturally removed by selecting a command . alternatively , von &amp; k@@ ile can be set , so that an easy jump to these positions is possible and the desired parameters can then be frozen .
under Settings k@@ ile ; set up ... in a hurry ; settings can be made to these lists . various W@@ Ã ¶ r@@ ter@@ ists can be selected for &amp; tex ; - and &amp; latex ; -@@ commands as well as W@@ Ã ¶ r@@ ter of the general language use .
the command mode is not useful for the complete execution of environments . it must always be entered a few letters with \ \ begin and the execution mode will result in a great list of ambient commands . on the other hand , the environments are used as often that &amp; k@@ ile ; a special mode for the complete realization of environments .
when calling the full @-@ completion mode over the menu Edit menu or the key root Alt + Shift key , the command to open the environment is automatically frozen and it appears \ \ begin { . after that , the environment can be continued in the simpl@@ est way and termin@@ ated by pressing the input button .
after this is complete , the environment is automatically closed again . once &amp; k@@ ile ; realize that it is a list environment , even a first \ \ item command will be frozen .
under Settings k@@ ile ; set up ... k@@ ile ; settings can be made to these lists . this mode uses the W@@ Ã ¶ r@@ ter@@ liste des complete inde@@ xing mode for &amp; tex ; - and &amp; latex ; -@@ commands .
&amp; k@@ ile ; support custom lists of def@@ aults , which are immediately replaced by longer strings . the lists can be set up under Settings K@@ ile ... M@@ ile will be executed fully . as an example of a check list , the file is ex@@ amp@@ le.@@ c@@ wl , for example the entry L = \ \ La@@ Te@@ X is included .
for example , if the letter L is typ@@ ed and the word def@@ ended from the menu Modi@@ fied Ab@@ brevi@@ ation or the key root C@@ trl + Alt Emp@@ ty , the letter L is replaced by the string \ \ La@@ Te@@ X .
great books are not helpful for automatic complete completion . however , it has been established that many users in a document are written more than once . thus , it offers &amp; k@@ ile ; the complete satisfaction for all already written Ã ¶ r@@ ter .
this mode can be set up in the Settings section ... M@@ ile can be disabled completely . here , too , the threshold for displaying complete details can be specified .
the full @-@ volume files can be installed in the sub@@ folder ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / k@@ ile / complete / mode / of the Persian home folder . mode stands for ab@@ brevi@@ ation ( short@@ cut ) , dictionary ( W@@ Ã ¶ r@@ ter@@ buch ) or tex .
the Graphics dialog creates the insertion of graphics as simple as possible . to view the basics of graphics formats , the sections should be taken into account .
PS files are not as well @-@ known as PDF files , but offer an excellent basis for changes and re@@ classi@@ fications of pages . if the PDF output is enabled , the pages can be re@@ arranged with a few &amp; Post@@ Script ; tools and then converted to a PDF file with ps@@ 2@@ pdf .
to review the results of the work , you need to compile the source code . all construction tools are group@@ ed in the menu Cre@@ ating , Cre@@ ating Conver@@ ting and Cre@@ ating View .
for comp@@ iling the source code for viewers such as &amp; Pop@@ ular ; or the further conversion , the key root Alt ; 2 can be used . afterwards , the DVI ; file can be viewed in the standard viewer using Alt ; 3 , converted into a PS file and viewed using Alt ; 5 the PS file .
when using the Quick build command , a viewer is usually called after comp@@ iling . if no built @-@ in viewer is used , a new window will open each time .

the script function from &amp; k@@ ile ; allows execution of EC@@ MA@@ Script code . the scripts can be managed by scripts in the vertical bar .
the API scripts are not yet fully developed and can be added in other versions of &amp; k@@ ile .

&amp; tet@@ ex ; and &amp; Tex@@ live ; delivered with many documents . it contains a documentation for the included packages and another latex ; reference .
a complete ref@@ usal for &amp; tex ; and its &quot; friend@@ ly@@ â consists not only of a description of all programs ( but a few important pack@@ ets are described ) but rather a complete instruction manual for the &amp; latex ; instructions are included and is therefore ideal for searching for a specific form@@ atting . since this is a very large document , it is divided into three important book@@ marks .
due to the amount of documents with those &amp; tet@@ ex ; / tex@@ live ; delivered , finding the right document is not always easy . as possible help offers &amp; tet@@ ex ; / tex@@ live ; the small application of tex@@ doc@@ t@@ k , which contains a database with all documents and for a graphical surface .
all documents are divided into categories and the biggest advantage is the search for package name or impact . by &amp; k@@ ile ; then only the results are displayed .

&amp; k@@ sig ; is a graphical editor to manage many different signatures for e @-@ mails . the signatures edit you in the graphical user interface of &amp; k@@ sig ; with the command @-@ line interface you generate random signatures or daily signatures from a list . this command @-@ line interface provides the signatures for external email programs such as &amp; k@@ mail .
for random signatures , any signature from the Sig@@ nature file of &amp; k@@ sig is read out . by many signatures with different quotes , styles and information , you can make your emails more varied and unique .
for day signatures , the same signature from the Sig@@ nature file of &amp; k@@ sig is read for the whole day . for each day you use different signatures , as with the random signatures , create unique emails .
to create a new signature , select C@@ trl ; N File New . this will give you an empty signature ; in the Sig@@ natures section . click on &amp; lt ; blank Sig@@ natures ; and add your new signature in the lower section . signature example Kon@@ qi kon@@ qi @ k@@ de@@ .org htt@@ p : / / www.@@ k@@ de@@ .org If you have entered your signature , save it with C@@ trl ; S file Save , or click the Save Disk icon .
you can create as many signatures as you wish . then you have a list of signatures for e @-@ mail programs such as &amp; k@@ mail ; whether you use e @-@ mails personally or professionally , there are always enough signatures .
to delete a signature , select it first and then remove it in the File menu or click the icon with the red cross removal in the tool@@ bar .

the plug @-@ ins , the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; invite , have with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; even possibly little to do . this makes the plug @-@ in system very powerful . you can immediately benefit from the additional functionality and do not have to wait until someone makes the wish in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; the plug @-@ ins can be used in a large number of &amp; GUI ; elements . read more about it below .
to install a plug @-@ in or a part , we start editing plug @-@ ins . this will open the following dialog :
this dialog allows you to manage all contained plug@@ ins and add new ones . we describe each &amp; GUI ; element in it :
here you can enter the search path . when adding plug @-@ ins without a memory location &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; this path to search the plug @-@ in .
often work on a project several persons in a kind of hierarch@@ ical relationship to each other . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; supports the specification of team members and these can be configured with Shift ; F@@ 7 Project Project Properties dialog .
the name and email entries are self @-@ explan@@ atory . nick@@ name is the user &apos;s nick@@ name and is used for unique identification .
one member can have several roles in the project , such as team leaders as well as sub@@ project leaders .
the user can select from the list of team members who he is . this happens by searching the team member out of the list and pus@@ hes the button S@@ etze . the currently selected member ( its identity ) appears bold after you are : text .
nick@@ names and the setting of their own identity are important in terms of news and notes . see for more information on comments .
in addition to the overview of their team there is another advantage by collecting the members of the team : an event for information can be created to the team leaders when something specific happens . see for more information .
event actions are actions that are executed when something specific happens in the project . an example would be recording the opening and closing of the project , so that later on , how much someone works on it , or sending a message when a file is backed up , or a script that takes a file into CV@@ S as soon as it is added to the project &amp; etc ;
on the event configuration page of the Shift ; F@@ 7 Project Project Properties dialog , events can be created , edited and deleted .
an email is sent to the add@@ res@@ see selected in the recipient list . the add@@ res@@ see may be a team or sub @-@ project leader . see , where such conductors are set up .
notes are special comments in the documents . they differ from normal comments by the following :
typ@@ ing notes is simple . it can either be selected from the Not@@ at@@ post from the Editor context menu or the ann@@ otation key word in a comment section followed by Not@@ ation text .
notes can be sent to a designated member of the team . in this case , the syntax @ ann@@ otation ( nick@@ name ) or @ ann@@ otation ( role ) , where the nick@@ name of the first name of the team member is , the corresponding area or sub@@ project names should be given , as in the following examples below .
nick@@ names and roles names are independent of upper or lower case letters , but spaces around the brackets and the syntax are invalid .
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; is a development environment for script and form@@ atting languages that is DT@@ D @-@ ag@@ nos@@ tic and supports web @-@ based form@@ atting and scrip@@ ting languages .
the settings can be reached via the Settings menu . here , only via &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; -@@ specific settings are treated , a short description for others can be found in .
the settings can be set by Settings Qu@@ anta ... called . this dialog extends over some pages that are treated one after the other .
the behaviour of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; regarding tags including code completion , it can be modified . the entries are :
large / lower@@ case tags : large / lower@@ case of automatically inserted tags . normal Groß / lower@@ case means the tags are inserted as they are described in the tag XML files .
large / lower@@ case of attribute : large / lower@@ case of automatically added attributes . normal / lower@@ case , the attributes are inserted in the way they are described in the tag@@ n@@ XML files .
automatically close optional tags : when checked , for tags that the closing tag is optional , this will be inserted immediately after the &amp; gt ;
do not lock optional tags : as for all other tags , except for simple tags .
update Start@@ - and End @-@ Tag automatically : if enabled , the corresponding closing tag will be changed and vice versa .
automatic setting of acc@@ ent characters : controls automatic conversion of acc@@ ented characters into appropriate encoding during typ@@ ing .
MI@@ ME types : mim@@ et@@ yp@@ es for the detection of various types of files . using the Standard button , the default settings can be restored .
standard character encoding : the encoding of newly created or other files opened with file opening ( where the encoding of the file can be ski@@ pped ) . this setting here will however be offset by the same in the project properties if a project is loaded .
standard DT@@ D : the selected DT@@ D is used for newly created files , or for files whose DT@@ D has not been recognized . this setting here is pushed by the same in the project properties if a project is loaded .
creating a backup copy : &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; creates backup copies regularly so that in case of a power failure or crash at the next start of the program , the document can be restored by this backup . this is not the same as saving the file .
the preview and documentation can be displayed either in the Editor area or in your own view ( or the documentation in a tab@@ by ) , which makes it possible to view the documentation , preview and source code at the same time .
set the default window settings back to default on the next start is useful when the user interface has per@@ si@@ sted by modi@@ fying the M@@ DI modes and do@@ cking / dependen@@ cy of views . it corresponds to the --@@ res@@ et@@ layout command line parameter .
the warning message section provides the control of the possibility to disable the display of warnings by hooks of no more .
the location to change the behavior of &amp; V@@ PL . it can set the display of symbols instead of scripts as well as the synchron@@ ization behavior of the V@@ PL@@ - and the source text view in shared mode .
here the par@@ ser and the structure tree , which represents the picture of the par@@ ser node in the document , can be adjusted in detail .
in the area of mouse click on the structure tree , the following action is possible to change the action triggered by clicking on the structure tree with the mouse buttons .
in the Stru@@ cture Settings section , the visibility of no@@ des in the tree , the frequency of the tree when editing , and how deep in a change in the structure tree is to be opened automatically . empty no@@ des are empty areas in the text , while empty groups are those where no element has been found in the current document .
the area to set ab@@ brevi@@ ations ( a kind of templates ) that will be displayed when editing to more extensive text . short@@ cuts are divided into groups , each one can be valid for several &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; this means there may be a valid group for PHP , in which the if@@ clause def@@ aults to something else than in a group valid for Jav@@ ascript .
here the plug @-@ ins can be managed . plug@@ ins are K@@ Part applications from third page , which can be re @-@ used by each part @-@ capable application , the most known and kon@@ quer@@ or ; . when inser@@ ting a plug @-@ in , the following must be specified :
address : the path to the plugin if it is not located at a standard location like $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / lib .
input : this information is passed to the plug @-@ in at startup , so it can open the current file , the associated folder ( path of the current file ) or the project folder .
load the component in the &quot; read @-@ only &quot; mode : check if the plug @-@ in ref@@ uses to load the load . only read @-@ Read @-@ K@@ Parts usually refuse to load when this option is not selected .
check the plug @-@ in : if this is enabled , then test &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; whether the entered information is correct . it also allows saving the entry , even if the plugin is not available at the moment , but it will be installed later .
for &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; from version 3.3 , troubleshooting has been completely re@@ developed . support for the no longer necessary built @-@ in &amp; PHP ; ( 3 ) de@@ bu@@ gger has been set , as well as support for the D@@ BG de@@ bu@@ gger . instead , a de@@ bu@@ gger plugin concept was implemented that allows different implement@@ ations via plug @-@ ins .
currently only a plugin is available , supporting the use of &amp; gu@@ bed ; inqu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; inserts .
using the de@@ bu@@ gger for a project starts with the selection of a suitable de@@ bu@@ gger plug @-@ in in the project settings . with the Options button next to the Deb@@ ug@@ ger Plugin Sel@@ ection field , the specific settings can be changed .
when a de@@ bu@@ gger is enabled for a project , some additional elements appear in the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; interface :
a view in which the contents of monitored variables are displayed . normally appears in the left dock .
a view where all stopping points are listed with line numbers and conditions . usually appears in the lower dock .
a view in which the output ( like in HTML ) of the de@@ bu@@ gger is shown . normally appears in the lower dock .
depending on the supported features of the de@@ bu@@ gger everything or part of the following functionality is available .
with this action , the connection to the de@@ bu@@ gger , if necessary , is made , or it tells the plugin to listen to de@@ bug@@ ging needs . this action is triggered by default when a project is opened , which uses a de@@ bu@@ gger so that it does not have to be taken care of .
the counter@@ part to de@@ bu@@ gger session starts the session . includes the connection to the de@@ bu@@ gger or termin@@ ates the listening according to requirements .
sends an HTTP request to the server to initiate a de@@ bug requirement . this is syn@@ onymous with the use of a browser to view the current document . the output of this request is shown in the Deb@@ ug@@ ger output .
tells the de@@ bu@@ gger to start running the script and send information about the monitored variables as well as the current line running . if this happens while the script is stopped , the execution will continue . if it happens before a de@@ bit request has begun , the script starts with the request .
tells the de@@ bu@@ gger to start running the script without sending information to monitored variables and the current line number . if this happens while a script is stopped , the execution proceeds . happens before a de@@ bit request is given , the execution starts as soon as a request is made .
the de@@ bu@@ gger performs the next instruction in the script without entering the functions or include .
the de@@ bu@@ gger performs the next instruction in the script , where possible in functions and include .
tells the de@@ bu@@ gger to ski@@ p the statement and go to the next as if there was not the current one .
opens a dialog in which a variable or an expression can be entered , which should be monitored . the monitored value appears in the variable view .
with this dialog a variable can be entered or a new value of a variable can be set .

document type Edi@@ ting Pack@@ ages ( D@@ TE@@ P ; s ) are used in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; used to provide support for mark@@ up and scrip@@ ting languages as well as &amp; CSS ; their simplicity and flexibility makes of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; a fast , user @-@ friendly &amp; IDE ; for web developers , easy to use and productive .
&amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; s exist in two ways , family 1 , the mark@@ up languages and family 2 , the script languages or &amp; CSS ; &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; s consist of two file types , the file descri@@ p@@ tion@@ rc ; and Tag@@ XML files with extension .@@ tag@@ . tool@@ bars are handy , symbolic links of image buttons ( above the editing pane ) , insert text and instructions quicker into a document than a user could ever .
&amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; s can be created manually ( see below ) , downloaded or automatically created from an existing DT@@ D . see for details of the conversion .
this document describes how Tag@@ XML files are to be created , then the &amp; descri@@ p@@ tion@@ rc ; and also tool bar . short , one &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; .
Tag@@ XML files ( .@@ tag ) define both the specific attributes for tags as well as the layout and contents of the properties dialog , the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; file contains the rules and information of the &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; even . tool@@ bars allow a quick insertion of tags into a document without danger of a write error .
tag folders are nothing but a folder . they only contain the file descri@@ p@@ tion@@ rc ; and the Tag@@ XML files . tag folders carry the name of the description language and version , so present . ( for example , html @-@ 4.0@@ 1 @-@ strict )
the table below lists the elements of the Tag@@ XML and declares if they are necessary or not . although not all are necessary , it is advisable to use as many as possible so that other users may have a better insight and more information when working with them .
the following chapter describes each element in detail . everything about the possibilities and limits is explained in a simple way .
this is the root element of a Tag@@ XML document . it can only occur once in a document . it may contain the definition of many tags , but it contains nothing but an element type about itself otherwise .
the type of tag is a script function . when using it is &amp; lt ; att@@ r &gt; an argument of the function . ( family 2 only )
valid only for class class . the name of the base class for this class . ( family 2 only )
only valid for the method method . speci@@ fies the name of the class where this method belongs . ( family 2 only )
if yes , the day has a common attribute group and the attributes within that tag can be added to any other tag . ( family 1 only )
this text is defined by the &amp; lt ; text &gt; tag . this is a single element type element .
describes an attribute of a tag . this element can only occur once for each attribute . it speci@@ fies the name and type of attribute . additionally , there are other tags that describe how to display this attribute &amp; etc ; This is a single element type element .
speci@@ fies the source code used to fill the attributes in the tag editor dialog and in the attribute tree .
requires source = d@@ co@@ p . the d@@ co@@ p interface within &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; used to achieve the source data .
requires source = d@@ co@@ p and the name of an interface . the d@@ co@@ p method name within &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; used to achieve the data source .
requires source = d@@ co@@ p , an interface and a method name . the arguments passed to the method . can be empty or % tag@@ name % , which means the name of the current tag .
a container day that groups the elements of a list together . it can occur only once for an attribute description . it is a single element type element .
speci@@ fies the position of the attribute text of a tag within a dialog . this tag can occur only once for each attribute in a dialog ( e.g. once for each ; att@@ r &gt; tag ) . the element is empty .
speci@@ fies the position and size of a field in dialog . this tag should be present for each field in dialog once ( e.g. one for each ; att@@ r &gt; and &amp; lt ; label &gt; tag ) . this element is empty .
speci@@ fies a list of elements that may appear within the tag to be defined . this element is a single element type .
returns a list of elements that end a day . this element is a single element type .
all Tag@@ XML files must start with an &amp; XML ; declaration : &amp; lt ; ? XML version = 1.0 encoding = UT@@ F @-@ 8 ? &gt; and must be properly ch@@ ained and closed .
spaces influence nothing , but pay attention to &amp; and &amp; lt ; characters . these should be replaced by &amp; lt ; , especially in elements such as &amp; lt ; tool@@ tip &gt; , &amp; lt ; wh@@ ats@@ this &gt; , and &amp; lt ; text &gt; will not cause any leg break@@ age , but some pieces of work would disappear .
to check the Tag@@ XML files , the Tools dialog is at the top of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; window to start and check Tag@@ X@@ ML@@ . another dialog will appear , whose simple instructions are to follow .
this function is currently not available yet . currently , verification only takes place when loading the Tag@@ XML files in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; .
in the following an example of a family 1 tag XML file . this file describes the &amp; lt ; schema &gt; element from the &amp; W3@@ C ; &amp; XML ; schema . the file name for this Tag@@ XML file should be schem@@ a.@@ tag .
the following is an example of a working family 2 Tag@@ XML file . in this file , a &amp; PHP ; over@@ load function is described . the file name of this Tag@@ XML file is supposed to be over@@ load@@ .@@ tag .
&amp; lt ; ? XML version = &quot; 1.0 &quot; encoding = &quot; UT@@ F @-@ 8 &quot; ? &gt; &amp; lt ; tags name = &quot; over@@ load &quot; type = &quot; function &quot; re@@ turn@@ Type = &quot; void &quot; &gt; &amp; lt ; att@@ r name = &quot; string &quot; status = &quot; optional &quot; / &gt; &amp; lt ; / tag &gt; &amp; lt ; / tags &gt;
the file descri@@ p@@ tion@@ rc ; file is just as simple and there is an editor for it , at@@ tain@@ able via DT@@ D Bear@@ bei@@ te DT@@ D settings . thus , di@@ ed@@ es@@ cri@@ p@@ tion@@ rc ; for a new created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; for a newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; should create a simple &amp; descri@@ p@@ tion@@ rc ; with the following entries :
&#91; general &#93; version = sol@@ sti@@ ce 1 for &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; version &amp; lt ; = 3.@@ 1.2 and 2 for any higher version . name = DT@@ D statement . ( - / / W3@@ C ; / / DT@@ D HTML 4.0@@ 1 Tran@@ si@@ tional / / EN ) Ni@@ ck@@ name = The simplified name of the DT@@ D . ( HTML 4.0@@ 1 Tran@@ si@@ tional ) . if not specified , the name is used as nick@@ name .
an action can be set with settings actions ... created . click New Action leads to the same dialog :
the key short@@ cut assigned to this action . by clicking on the user @-@ defined button , a short@@ cut can be assigned ; with cap , the current short@@ cut is removable .
the simpl@@ est actions . a text can be entered in the detailed settings and when exec@@ uting the action , this text is inserted in the document at the current cur@@ sor position . see the example below .
this is the most powerful type of action . with the help of this action , external applications ( usually scripts , but not limited to it ) , which change the document or use as input ( or parts of the document ) , can be started . examples from &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; even the quick start dialog or the different see in ... actions for the ( X ) HTML @-@ DT@@ EPs .
first , the name of the script and the interpreter must be given . example : SH / home / my@@ Home / my@@ Scrip@@ t.@@ sh .
although qualified paths are allowed , it is recommended to use the % scrip@@ t@@ dir directive in the command line , such as sh % scrip@@ t@@ dir / my@@ Scrip@@ t.@@ sh@@ . In this way , try &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; the script in the following places : $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / scripts in their path : $ PAT@@ H There are other special variables that can be used in the command line :
% f : we replaced the URL of the current document . in case of a local document , file : / from the document name will be removed .
% pi@@ d : is replaced with the PID of the current &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; process . if von &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; only one instance runs , the text unique is attached to the PID number . this is useful if D@@ CO@@ P is used to control &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; it is used by the external script .
the parameters for this event , usually the file name of the current document or path to the project file .
in addition to the above listed methods , a script can input from &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; in the default input field , you can specify what to send to the default input . options are :
selected text : the selected range of the document is sent to the script . the % input variable is usually only useful with this setting .
according to the input , the output of the executed application can also be re@@ directed . there are two types of output : normal output , directed to the standard output ; error messages , directed to the standard output . it can be specified , indicating the output written to the standard output by setting the output selection field :
if there are many tags in the mark@@ up language , it is recommended to divide the tags into logical groups . it is necessary for each group to create their own tool@@ bar . in any given case , it is not too many , so you can create a tool@@ bar with the name of the mark@@ up .
once a tool bar is added , you need to add and configure action . select Settings .
the parts of this window are pretty self @-@ explan@@ atory . pressing the New Action button at the bottom of the window will start the edit mode .
fill in all the required fields and add the tag to the appropriate tool@@ bar .
complete everything and , if the day has attributes and you are planning to use their use , enable &quot; Edit Tag &quot; dialog when available so that an input is possible when using the action .
Ig@@ itt ! is this a ug@@ ly symbol . who should remember the action in conjunction with this symbol ? replace it before we have difficulty .
to create a symbol that the action is better represented , we will use &amp; ki@@ con@@ edit ; select from the &amp; K@@ Menu ; , Graphics Other Programs ( or where else it is located in your distribution ) .
&amp; ki@@ con@@ edit ; uses 32@@ x@@ 32 pixels by default , but we need 22@@ x@@ 22 . to change this , select Edit .
please note that the created symbol not only helps you to remember what action does , but also to all other users of the &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; .
with regard to the start of the day , I decided to create a starting button as a symbol . by using green ( green is usually called los , star@@ ed , further interpreted ) , or at least , a message to the user will be sign@@ aled that clicking on this symbol will insert it ; start@@ led ; -@@ tag will be inserted in the current document .
after creating the symbol it has to be connected with the action . this is done through the menu with Settings actions ... ( in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; ) and selection of the desired action . next to the Text Field is a button , press it .
select the folder in which the stored symbol is located , select it and confirm with OK .
press the Apply button and continue with other tags , so there are some , or confirm with OK to complete .
suppose you want to add some common &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; add functions to the tool@@ bar or it should be divided into a better overview by some separ@@ ators into several groups . open the tool bar to set dialog over Settings tool@@ bar . make sure that the required tool bar is selected .
I want to select the separ@@ ator ( at the top left ) for my tool@@ bar . after selecting the item to be added to the tool@@ bar , press the arrow button to the right . this adds the element to the tool@@ bar .
for example , I would like to have a quick way to access the kon@@ quer@@ or preview . I will select it and add to the tool@@ bar .
please note how separ@@ ators support group@@ ing . someone who doesn &apos;t know my tool@@ bar would believe that the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; button is the opposite of the start button .
the new tool@@ bar must be tested by absor@@ bing all symbols to make sure everything works .
save to the right folder . after Neu@@ e@@ XML does not exist , it will be created in the root folder , but your tool@@ bar ( s ) should be stored in the correct folder . please adjust your file descri@@ p@@ tion@@ rc ; so that your tool@@ bar ( s ) will be loaded when a file is opened by the appropriate type .
perhaps the most notable extension of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; for normal users it is possible to add documentation for the scrip@@ ting language or the form@@ atting language that you like most . therefore , this chapter describes how I create a &amp; PHP ; documentation tree for my personal use .
before starting your own documentation , you might be able to check in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; -@@ Rep@@ os@@ it@@ ory whether someone has done it for you .
there are two parts in this process . first you need to find an existing documentation for the form@@ atting / script / etc / language . then you need to create the do@@ cr@@ c file . we leave the first part to you , we will treat the second one here .
# K@@ DE configuration file &#91; Tree &#93; Doc dir = path , relative to this file , to the documentation HTML files e.g. PHP ; 4.2 documentation section 1 = Sec@@ tion@@ 1.@@ html section 2 = # Sec@@ 2.1 , # Sec@@ 2.2 , # Sec@@ 2.3 = Sec@@ 2.@@ 3.@@ html ... &#91; Con@@ text &#93; Con@@ text@@ 1.@@ html func@@ 2 = func@@ 2.@@ html tag@@ 1 = tag@@ 1.@@ html tag@@ 3 = tag@@ 2.@@ html tag@@ 3 = get@@ 3.@@ html
the Tree section defines the visible part of the documentation in the documentation tree . for example , you can see now in the &amp; PHP ; documentation :
# K@@ DE Con@@ fig File &#91; Tree &#93; Doc dir = ph@@ p@@ 42 / # top level element top element = PHP 4.2 documentation PHP 4.2 documentation = Table of Cont@@ ents , # Get@@ ting Start@@ ed , # Language Reference Table of Cont@@ ents = Intro@@ duction , ... Basic syntax = langu@@ age@@ .@@ basic @-@ syn@@ tax@@ .@@ html ...
note the # before Get@@ ting Start@@ ed and Language Reference . this indicates that it is sub@@ folders in the tree with its own content . there is no known limit for the box depth ( except through reason ) m@@ d@@ ash ; but try it yourself .
note that the table of contents is refer@@ enced directly to a file ( and log@@ ically at the top end of the tree view &amp; m@@ d@@ ash ; folder will be displayed ! ) .
spaces influence nothing , but pay attention to &amp; and &amp; lt ; characters . these should be replaced by &amp; lt ; in all &amp; XML ; -@@ based &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; resources files are replaced .
the content section is the area of the do@@ cr@@ c file which is used for creating context sensitive help . for example , when writing a &amp; PHP script , the documentation for the my@@ sq@@ l _ fetch _ array function is to be displayed . by selecting the function name and pressing C@@ trl ; H for context help , the documentation would be displayed directly . there are only two types of entries here : the context list ( Con@@ text@@ List ) and the file connection lines .
a simple list of context @-@ elements which are to be available ( for &amp; PHP ; these are the functions of PHP ; ) .
now you can save your file do@@ cr@@ c to $ HO@@ ME / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / doc or $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / doc for local / global use . then create a folder ( as you specified it in your file do@@ cr@@ c ) in the same folder as do@@ cr@@ c and copy your HTML documentation to it .
if you are sure that these are good and worth sharing , send your doc@@ cr@@ c files with a description of important information , such as which documentation was used to the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; -@@ community . you will not be rich , but proud to have worked with the best web development platform .
with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; you are not alone . it is possible to share the wast@@ ed resources ( D@@ TE@@ P packages , tool@@ bars with actions , scripts , templates ) with others . there are two ways to do this :
the resources can be sent by email to friends , partners or else to whom . in different places there is an email @-@ sending item listing , such as sending DT@@ D DT@@ D @-@ Package ( D@@ TE@@ P ) with email , tool@@ bar tool@@ bar with email , in the context menu of files and folders in the template and in the Scrip@@ ting tree .
the resources can be uploaded into our main archive from where all the others &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; users can download them . to make a contribution , we recommend signing the resources by using a G@@ PG / P@@ GP key . thus , the source of resources is guaranteed , both for our team and for the later users .
when up@@ loading , you are asked for your private G@@ PG @-@ key after your pas@@ sp@@ hr@@ ase ( the pas@@ sp@@ hr@@ ase will not be saved ) , or in the event you have multiple keys , you can select one . in the New Resource dialog you need to fill in the input fields ( URL preview can remain empty ) and click OK to start up@@ loading .
up@@ loading can be uploaded from the DT@@ D DT@@ D ( D@@ TE@@ P ) menus , upload tool bar tool@@ bar , and start in the context menu of files and folders in the templates and scripts tree .
after downloading a resource , still before installation , examined &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; the integrity of the resource by checking integrity and signing . in case of problems it warns and it can then be ab@@ orted . if the integrity is given and the resource is signed correctly , a notification appears with the indication of the source of the resource .
it is possible to work in XML languages currently not supported by &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; however , creation can be time @-@ consuming because hundreds of tag files in tag XML format might be necessary . there is the easiest way to automatically convert DT@@ D into a D@@ TE@@ P package .
the conversion can be started from the DT@@ D File menu and converting a DT@@ D . select the .@@ dt@@ d file with the DT@@ D description which is to be used . then the following dialog appears :
destination directory name : the newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; is written with this name in the $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / d@@ te@@ p folder .
doc@@ type Defin@@ i@@ tions@@ line : the string that appears in the ! doc@@ type tag as HTML PU@@ BLI@@ C - / / W3@@ C / / DT@@ D HTML 4.0@@ 1 Tran@@ si@@ tional / / EN htt@@ p : / / www.@@ w@@ 3.@@ org / TR / HTML@@ 4 / loos@@ e.@@ dt@@ d
fine adjustment of the D@@ TE@@ P after conversion : if enabled , brings &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; after conversion the &amp; descri@@ p@@ tion@@ rc ; editor , with the details of the newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; it is recommended to use this option .
in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; there are some key concepts . in order to understand and to understand full benefits from &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us , one must first famili@@ ari@@ ze oneself with these fundamental concepts . this chapter seeks to bring these concepts closer to them , without their understanding and qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; little benefit .
in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; the working area is divided into three areas : global , local and project @-@ related . this distinction concerns a number of components in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; .
global elements are available for everyone , the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; use , available . everything that is marked globally is stored in the common folder structure of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; this allows the group of administrators to secure different tool bars , actions and patterns in the global tree , which then are available to everyone in a multi @-@ user environment on the system .
local elements are a personal collection of web development tools for a single user . these are user @-@ specific patterns and tool@@ bars . local elements are stored in the user directory so that they can only use this user personally .
project @-@ related elements are only available within a particular project . this can be all of &amp; CSS ; patterns to tool@@ bars with special actions specifically for the files of a particular project . simply said , this is the most restricted size . all elements are stored in the project folder tree , which allows the common use of special tools and patterns from all employees within the project .
the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; -@@ M@@ DI ; consists of several main areas : the editor window , the tree views , the cart@@ wheels with information and the tool@@ bars . please check in and for more information on these areas .
you can click the tab with the right mouse button to get a contex@@ tual menu with the current document , such as close the current , other or all card tra@@ its , rel@@ o@@ ad , delete or upload the document , jump to a book@@ mark or execution of CV@@ S commands to the current document .
rec@@ tan@@ gles in the Editor area lead to a further context menu of the edited document contents , such as basic processing steps ( cut / paste / paste ) , editing the tags located under the mouse cur@@ sor , using the word under the mouse cur@@ sor or opening the file , if the string under the mouse cur@@ sor calls a file .
at the upper end of the editor window are the tool@@ bars of the editor . currently , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; &amp; HTML ; 4.0@@ 1 Tran@@ si@@ tional as the standard for which a set of tool@@ bars is shown . in the course of further expansion of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us , the tool@@ bars are adapted to the new functions and thus associated user needs .
the use of tool@@ bars is really easy . if you want to insert a single tag , e.g. &amp; lt ; in your document , then click the symbol representing the tag . now , you can insert the data for that particular tag . if you want to insert a tag that has several attributes ( such as anchor ) , you can fill out different fields in a dialog .
the tree views ( Q@@ IT ; ) allow you to navigate through the information to &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; to navigate , open it and ro@@ am . in the presentation with card readers are available for files , project templates , document structure , scripts , attributes and documentation .
project management is a powerful tool that provides &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; this view shows all files in the project and allows managing the files in the project by right mouse click . actions such as add , remove , upload or delete the files from the storage media can be executed using the pop @-@ up menu .
another possibility of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; is the use of templates . almost everything can be a template : pictures , program parts , a whole website &amp; etc . there are all options open to you .
templates can be divided into three categories depending on the context they are used . the category depends on the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; work@@ space . global templates are always available , local templates for the appropriate user and templates in projects can only be used in the project .
here you will find information about the available scrip@@ ting languages . the concept of structure in Global , Local and Project also works here . by clicking with the left mouse button , you can retrieve the available information to a script . by right mouse button , further functions are available , such as start , edit or send an email .
this view shows the internal structure of the active document . by clicking on an element , the cur@@ sor is placed in the document on the position of the element . by right @-@ clicking an item opens a list of commands in terms of navigation and refres@@ h of the tree .
this tree appears below the other tree views . with it , it can change attributes and nam@@ esp@@ aces . the fil@@ ing system aligned to the content makes it possible to change all available attributes with just a few mouse clicks .
here is the complete documentation for web technology for your development . you can download pre @-@ packed documentation for &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; from qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; &apos; documentation site , you can create your own documentation , and by adding a folder doc to a project can be attached , edited and viewed .
by default , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; two tab@@ s at the bottom of the window , which can be accessed via the useful information : the message window and the problem window .
this tab shows information about each script running in Qu@@ anta . for example , the currently used DT@@ D of the current document and all the changes to the DT@@ D are displayed .
this tab shows all errors in the current document mark@@ up . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; scripts that are executed are all error messages ( if there are ) in this window .
the tool@@ bars are extensive and easy to understand . show them on a symbol and they will display the appropriate command . the tool@@ bar &apos;s chocolate side is the possibility to define own commands as symbols in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us .
another feature of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; is the ability to send a tool@@ bar with E@@ Mail . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; sends the tool@@ bar as compressed T@@ ar archive via &amp; k@@ mail ; . if you receive a tool@@ bar in an email , you can save it in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; like any other backup and load !
it is reasonable if you want to customize the location of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; files on your system . for this , auto@@ conf has a number of options that can be passed to the configure script . to get a complete list of all options , enter . / configure --@@ help . the options are easy to understand and do not run here .
if you have problems with starting &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us , you should check if your path contains the &amp; k@@ de ; 3 bin folder . also , you should make sure that is not an older version of &amp; k@@ de ; 3 in the PAT@@ H in front of your bin folder . the same goes for &amp; Q@@ t ; .
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; is a web development tool for K@@ DE surface . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; has been optimized for rapid web development and combines a mature development environment with a multitude of powerful functions .
during the effort to create the best &amp; HTML editor , the developers of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us began to deal with an obvious idea : what if &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; an independent , exten@@ sible mark@@ up language editor ? well , this would make him the absolutely great web development tool for &amp; quot ; so it was done .
no longer limited to pure &amp; HTML ; restricted , is &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; well on the way to a general and comprehensive web development tool . summar@@ ized : if you can define it in &amp; XML ; then &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; then the appropriate &amp; IDE ; be .
well , to the above claim must be noted that &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; as a product based on the outstanding efforts of the entire &amp; quot ; developer commun@@ e . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; follows , in good use of free software , the idea of Why does someone else have developed ? thanks to the &amp; k@@ de ; sc@@ aff@@ ol@@ ding is not only possible for users and developers , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; to expand as they need it for their needs .
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; enables web developers to use an intuitive and powerful multi @-@ document surface ( M@@ DI ; ) . this can dramatically increase productivity . by means of the program Kom@@ mander they can extend &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; ( more about it in . )
&amp; Qu@@ anta ; Plus ; is a web development environment for HTML and related languages . it has been designed for a fast web development and has been quickly expanded to a mature editor with many powerful features .
&amp; Qu@@ anta ; Plus is in no way connected with commercial versions of &amp; Qu@@ anta ; the original developers left the G@@ PL licensed version and produced a commercial program .
for more details , use help : / Qu@@ anta ( either this URL in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; enter , or use k@@ hel@@ p@@ center help : / Qu@@ anta ) .
&amp; Qu@@ anta ; is currently being developed and supervised by Eric L@@ aff@@ oon Sequ@@ it@@ ur @ k@@ de@@ .org and Andr@@ as Man@@ tia am@@ anti@@ a @ k@@ de@@ .org .
a quick access list of files you have opened . this list is changing every time you open a file that is not on it , but the oldest item will be removed .
this allows you to save code parts and whole files as templates for later use . check the section on templates . if you try to save the selected file / text outside the local / project template folder , only one error is reported .
converted special characters to &amp; HTML when inser@@ ting from the clip@@ board there , so that they appear correctly and are not mis@@ understood by the browser as form@@ atting instructions .
converts the text from clip@@ board into &amp; URL ; -@@ write which is the correct way to insert special characters and spaces in &amp; URL ; s . primarily to insert &amp; URL ; s used in the anchor tag .
enables you to select the block selection . this allows you to select text blocks using the &amp; Shift ; button .
go directly to a line number . this is very helpful if your &amp; PHP ; -@@ script exec@@ utes error messages !
searches a string or regular expression in the selected directory . a kind gre@@ p or sed with GUI and pre@@ defined expressions to help you .
displays the message window or not . this is the window in which you see the display of script actions and the de@@ bu@@ gger .
dis@@ connect and turn on the problem rep@@ orter at the bottom of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; main window . the problem rep@@ orter is activated as soon as you switch to the structure tree .
displays the column column on the left of the main window . this column allows you to set book@@ marks with a mouse click .
if there are book@@ marks in the current file , they will appear in the menu along with the entries Previous or Next , depending on the cur@@ sor position in the document .
book@@ marks from other opened documents appear group@@ ed in the menu according to the fil@@ ename of the other documents .
opens an existing project from hard disk . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; -@@ Projects are stored with the extension .@@ web@@ pr@@ j .
presents a dialog for inser@@ ting files into the current project . the selected files will then be copied to the project directory .
searches the project directory for new files that could be there . this allows , for example , to copy graphics files into your project folder or sub@@ folder and then add them to the project .
upload the files in your project to the server . the list of available means of transport depends on your version of &amp; k@@ de ; and if you have downloaded more input / output modules ( K@@ IO slaves ) .
settings such as &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; the project manages . in the chapter &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; -@@ Projects you will find the details .
load a project tool@@ bar . these are stored in project dir / tool@@ bars and are only available in this menu if you have assigned them to this project .
a dialog to save your tool@@ bar . allows you to select the type of tool@@ bar : local or project .
opens a dialog to add a new tool@@ bar . that will only create the name . actions must be set by setting actions ... added . tool@@ bars will be saved through tool@@ bars of tool@@ bars , or you will be asked if you want to save the tool@@ bars .
removes a tool@@ bar from the field of view . this does not remove them from the hard drive . if you haven &apos;t saved the tool@@ bar yet , you &apos;ll be asked if you want to do that .
this allows you to send your own tool@@ bar to someone ( perhaps to the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; team so that the tool@@ bar is present in the next release ) . the menu item opens a new e @-@ mail message with the tool@@ bar as attachment .
enables loading of tool@@ bars to the main server , where everyone can access it . see in .
load a &amp; DT@@ D ; that has made you or someone else and convert to the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; own description format .
loading / refres@@ h entities from the &amp; DT@@ D ; it makes sense if the entities from the &amp; D@@ TE@@ P should be refres@@ hed without rene@@ wing the whole &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; if this is global and there is no write permission in the global K@@ DE folder , the store will fail .
this menu contains a list of tags that are present in the currently loaded tool@@ bar . if the default ( HTML ; ) tool@@ bar is loaded , there is a sub@@ menu in the Tags menu that contains the list of tags / actions on this tool@@ bar .
allows access to the current day settings dialog when there is one . this entry is always present in the Tags menu , followed by &amp; DT@@ D ; -@@ specific sub@@ menus .
currently , this only works with ( X ) HTML DT@@ Ds . intelligent insertion means that &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; insertion by tool bar is denied if this tag contra@@ di@@ cts the rules at this location .
in the plug @-@ in menu , the available plug @-@ ins are listed under the above menu items . click on them . click an active plug @-@ in to disable it .
select the syntax highlight mode for the current file . the list of available origin schem@@ ata depends on the kate ; version .
select the type of poin@@ ter identi@@ fier . very useful when you know people who use other OS platforms for developing . choose Unix , Windows / DOS or Macintosh .
check the syntax of the current document using the selected DT@@ D ; by using the external application ti@@ dy .
instant switching between the different types of user interface . due to some limitations in the K@@ DE libraries , switching can sometimes take time or cause un@@ nice graphics . recommended is the card map mode , which is also the default setting , or the sub@@ window mode , which corresponds to the representation in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; 3.2 and earlier .
in addition , this menu contains an entry for each open sub@@ window . selecting an entry will activate the corresponding sub @-@ window .
enables the status bar to be displayed at the bottom of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; main window on / off .
the changes in this dialog affect any application using the K@@ HTML part , including the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; web browser .
set the behavior of the editor window . in the documentation of &amp; kate , see the details .
a dialog appears where you can delete entries from the tool@@ bars , or add them and modify the sequences .
this should generate help according to the environment of the mouse @-@ poin@@ ter , but is not yet implemented .
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; is a high @-@ quality product that is freely available and licensed , but as with any open source project developers can always use help . if they want to support the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; development in financial form , they find the way here .
the fields are self @-@ explan@@ atory and should preferably be filled from top to bottom , since , for example , after completing the project name , the whole directory structure is automatically completed for the rest of the project . all of these paths and author information fields can be adjusted later using Shift ; F@@ 7 project project features .
here is the name for the project , for example fo@@ o . when entering the name , file is filled in automatically .
this is the name of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; project file . by default , it has the name of the project in lower@@ case letters and without spaces with extension web@@ pr@@ j ( e.g. f@@ oo@@ .@@ web@@ pr@@ j ) . this file is stored in the project directory .
here is the server address of the machine you want to access , one unless you edit local data . either a name ( host@@ nam@@ e.@@ ex@@ .com ) or an IP address ( 127@@ .0@@ .0@@ .1 ) are possible .
if you leave this field empty , the default settings of the selected log will be used . depending on the remote host setting , an adjustment could be necessary .
this is the folder where templates are stored for the project . it is a relative path to the project and by default . if a common collection of files is used for different projects , this folder should be set instead of the standard .
this is the folder where the tool@@ bars are stored for the project . it is a relative path to the project and tool@@ bars by default . if a common collection of files is used for different projects , this folder should be set instead of the standard .
this allows adding files from the local fil@@ esystem to the project . multiple files or entire folders can be selected .
this setting is great if you have static web content you want to download and change . in server @-@ side scripts ( e.g. &amp; PHP ; , Python , &amp; etc ; ) you have to proceed differently .
let it be linked if files that are located somewhere in the main folder of the project should be included . if a project is started from scratch , do not hook .
with this option all files and folders within the main folder will be displayed and you can make a precise selection according to good man@@ ure .
this shows a list of files in the main folder . you can select the desired files by hooks or by removing the tick , cl@@ inging out of the project .
the last screen of the new project wiz@@ ard includes three settings that simplify your work . these settings can be uploaded in the menu with project project properties in the sub@@ window profile or using Shift ; F@@ 7 short@@ cuts .
some settings correspond to those in the project wiz@@ ard and are described in . the additional entries are explained below .
a list of fil@@ en@@ ames ( wild@@ cards are possible ) , which are ignored in project @-@ related operations such as project folders .
additional option to top , including files listed in .@@ c@@ v@@ sign@@ ore , will be excluded from the project .
the project view , which is loaded when the project is opened , can be read more about project views .
this allows the required de@@ bu@@ gger to be selected . currently , only G@@ ub@@ ed is supported . more information about G@@ ub@@ ed is found in . the de@@ bu@@ gger plugin can be set with the Options button .
high loading profiles ( see in ) can be set up in the profiles sub@@ window , as well as display of a tree view for the content of the server for each profile by drag@@ ging a separate tree view for each profile .
in the sub@@ window Team configuration , project members can be added , edited or deleted as well as a mailing list . see the details .
in the event configuration sub@@ window , events can be switched on and add , change or delete events . event actions are executed when a pre @-@ defined event occurs , such as backing up a file . see the details .
by default , open &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; the last project that was opened . you can &apos;t influence this behavior at the moment .
to open another project , select Open Project ... from the menu Project or the Symbol project open from the tool@@ bar . the dialog box opens and allows selection of a project . projects have .@@ web@@ pr@@ j as extension .
when &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; the project file is automatically saved . you will be asked if you want to save changes before leaving , if &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; changed files . the same happens when you load a new project .
the project manager gives free access to the files in the project . there , the files can be managed in the current project .
folders behave as well , but the entries are missing and opening with ... in the context menu available with the right mouse button :
here you can select different profiles . the profile contains information about the location of the uploaded files . see .
allows you to remove the current profile . if only a profile is present , the button will be blocked to prevent removal .
the password will be kept in the core memory and forgotten by programm@@ ers . this option is useful when frequent up@@ loading of files is necessary and the more uns@@ af@@ e password on the disk storage option is not in question .
this will stop the transfer or simply leave the dialog if you change your mind before up@@ loading .
in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us , many upload profiles can be created and thus the project ( or parts of the project ) can be uploaded to different servers . when editing or creating a profile , this dialog appears :
this is the server name on which the files are to be copied . either a fully qualified domain name or an IP address will work .
the transfer protocol for up@@ loading . the list depends on the version of &amp; k@@ de ; and the installed ki@@ o slaves . at least you should choose from &amp; FTP ; , file ( local ) and n@@ fs .
the port for transfer . normally , this does not need to be changed , except the network administrator does not run a service on the usual port .
depending on your fear threshold , this is either a time @-@ saving function or a danger . use it at your discretion . the password is saved on the disk , so it can not be read easily , but everyone with programming knowledge can easily see it in plain text .
a project view is just one set of files and tool@@ bars . it can give a lot of views in a project , i.e. by simply sli@@ pping the view , various files and tool@@ bars can be loaded and replace the currently opened files and tool@@ bars .
views can be saved , opened or deleted from the project tool@@ bar menu , accessible via Settings tool@@ bar project tool@@ bar .
this chapter describes the parts of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; with which one has the most to do . this not only helps increase productivity but also allows the adaptation of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; to the own method of working .
as mentioned above , tool@@ bars in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; best custom@@ iz@@ able through the tool@@ bar menu . adding and adding will differ . adding tool bars will be treated at the bottom of the Add tool bar section .
the tool@@ bars and symbols on it can be set either by context menu ( right @-@ click on the tool@@ bar ) , in which new action , a new tool@@ bar can be created , other actions such as tool@@ bars can be executed , which can be specified in the dialog , where to specify which actions should be visible on this or other tool@@ bars .
by calling the context menu to an action ( icon ) on a tool@@ bar , the entries action will be removed and action processed , which are self @-@ explan@@ atory .
the tool@@ bars and the actions on them can set up tool@@ bar settings in the menu ... and set settings actions .. Set .
templates are basically document skel@@ et@@ ons , code sni@@ ps and files to link . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; templates generally like a common file system with exp@@ and@@ able organization and interfaces . you can copy , move or link any existing directory to the template tree . templates have in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; in about the restrictions you set for the fil@@ esystem .
some with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; provided templates have conditions for their use . please read the conditions specified at the beginning of each template before use .
binary templates are usually included in documents using links ( e.g. ima@@ gery with im@@ g src = / src / ur@@ l ) . some examples can be found in the template tree under global templates . more information on the template tree is available .
documents can be of any text document type . on the basis of these templates , new documents can be created . normally , more specific documents are created in appropriate sub@@ folders . a simple framework for the purpose and organiz@@ es the work in a corresponding way to be efficient . see for more information on the template tree .
this type of template is useful if not a new document is to be inserted into the documents based on a template but the same text area . you can find everything from a comment about a final note up to a complete menu system on Jav@@ ascript or Perl @-@ based . some examples are found in the template tree under global templates . see for more information on the template tree .
as the name says , these templates are used for whole web sites as templates . they are a collection of various documents that can be organized in a folder structure , summar@@ ized in a compressed tar archive . currently there are no examples in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; .
create a document structure as you like ( XML ; , &amp; HTML ; , Doc@@ Book &amp; etc ; . ) and select File As a template save as local template ....
once this is done , you notice that ( even though it was saved as a project template ) the template is not visible in the project tree . see the template tree under project templates .
select text in your document and click File As template to save selection as a local / project template . alternatively , the selection can be simply drag@@ ged with drag and drop to the tree view templates .
the creation of binary templates is simple : copy the file only to a template folder . it can be used for all file management functions , such as drag@@ ging and dro@@ pping or inser@@ ting through the file tree of Kon@@ quer@@ or .
you can click on a folder to the right and select site template in the file tree or in the project file , select a name for the template and secure it . by default , it is backed up in the project folder , but of course it can be stored as a local or global template .
project templates allow a very targeted approach . you can type he@@ aders and foot@@ ers , or dynamic with &amp; PHP ; design , insert or link files with them . in addition , you can keep some things in mind when using templates in projects .
the template structure in the sub@@ window templates is based on the files submitted in $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / templates and $ HO@@ ME / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / templates . each of these folders is equivalent to one of four types of containers as explained above .
to specify the behavior of a folder , right click on the folder and select Properties in the context menu . the following dialog appears :
a drop @-@ down sel@@ ector with the three types previously described ; files , text or templates . this selection is blin@@ ded as soon as an el@@ ter attribute is inherited .
this is enabled by default and fits for everything except the regular folders in the template overview . if a root folder is configured in such a way , it would generally disable templates in this path unless they were explicitly enabled . in case of a normal folder , the bla@@ h would appear with something like Text @-@ Block . if nothing appears , one probably finds itself in a root folder .
allows a preceding or displayed text for templates in this folder . this could be general he@@ aders or foot@@ ers for all templates for a particular project , and by copying content templates in a folder with custom he@@ aders / foot@@ ers to equi@@ p a whole presentation with the appropriate he@@ aders / foot@@ ers .
in addition , you have context menu ( show right mouse button ) over a complete command collection for adding folders or copying and paste from one location to another .
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; offers two modes : V@@ PL ; Editor and V@@ PL ; &amp; Source editor that can be reached from the View menu . the first mode replaces the code editor by the V@@ PL ; editor and the second divi@@ des the editor window into two parts : the source code editor and the V@@ PL ; editor .
the V@@ PL ; editor works as follows : it loads a document like a normal &amp; HTML ; - or &amp; X@@ HTML ; -@@ page and a cur@@ sor appears . then you can edit and turn back to source code editor where the changes made in the V@@ PL ; editor in the source code are visible .
when working with the V@@ PL ; -@@ editor in a document , which &amp; PHP ; contains , a small green symbol shows the default of &amp; PHP ; source text . it is not possible to edit it directly with the V@@ PL ; to edit &amp; PHP ; there are no plans to change this behavior .
the second mode works exactly like the first one , except that at the same time the changes are visible in both the source code editor and the V@@ PL ; the cur@@ sor is activated in the source code editor and in the V@@ PL ; with pressing F@@ 9 this mode is activated , this mode is already active , puts the active cur@@ sor from one window to the other , and the position in the document is maintained .
the synchron@@ ization between the V@@ PL ; editor and the source code editor can be set via Settings Qu@@ anta .... When choosing V@@ PL , you can choose between synchron@@ ization after one click or automatically . in principle , the recommendation : a small chip for fast computers and a large span for slow .
assuming you want to change the title of the website , it is possible to select the document properties . this allows you to edit invisible tags when working with the V@@ PL ; the document properties dialog will also be called as soon as a new document is created with the V@@ PL ; this is used to reduce the manual code . this allows you to change the following :
met@@ a tags allow the storage of information about the document itself e.g. keywords for Internet search engines . met@@ a elements can be added or removed by pressing the two buttons below . a click on the list allows to change the content , e.g. keywords on the column name and keyword key word 2 on the contents column .
CSS rules are the new way of designing the appearance of pages in the browser . you can add or delete CSS rules using the buttons below the list . a change over the list is exactly as possible with the met@@ a elements . editing CSS rules is currently not supported yet .
it is possible to include an external CSS style template by pressing the file @-@ open button and selecting the appropriate file .
use of cur@@ sor is possible as in text processing , by moving with arrows . in rare circumstances , the cur@@ sor acts as an intr@@ insi@@ c character . the marker works as usual . text can be inserted by typ@@ ing and del@@ eting using the button or removing button .
inser@@ ting tags is done in the same way as in the source code editor . it is to be noted that inser@@ ting tags before already existing identical tags is not removed , for example , if an anchor day , surrounded with text , must be removed from any other surrounding anchor tag .
some tool@@ bars like the table wiz@@ ard or the Listen @-@ Wiz@@ ard are disabled . they will work later in the &amp; V@@ PL ; in this release , the tables or lists need to be used tool@@ bars .
&amp; x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g ; is a tool for exam@@ ining style sheets . unlike other programs for style sheets , the search for certain elements is possible and execution of style sheets can be tra@@ cked .
to compile &amp; x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g ; successfully compile , do not need except &amp; k@@ de ; nor libraries lib@@ x@@ s@@ lt , li@@ be@@ x@@ s@@ lt and lib@@ x@@ ml , which are already present at a typical installation of &amp; quot ; .

x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g determines the full path from a file name without path . file names in the same folder as the top loaded style file name with relative path to the con x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g file is possible , for example , a style file file .. / en / x@@ sl@@ doc@@ .@@ s@@ l , the following input is possible :
in this command , a partial or total compliance with a template named QNA@@ ME or a specified name name is checked . &amp; eg ; template matches with any QNAP that contains the template template .
every nam@@ esp@@ ace in the specified &quot; QNAP &quot; will be extended by the rules defined by the nam@@ esp@@ ace defined in the X@@ SL source file . x@@ s@@ l : test@@ 1 will be extended to htt@@ p : / / www.@@ w@@ 3.@@ org / 199 / X@@ SL / Trans@@ form : test@@ 1
a sought @-@ after stopping point has to be solved for the corresponding UR@@ I and line number . this is done automatically when loading the first template by x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g . break@@ points are checked again shortly after starting each run .

add the parameter with the name &amp; lt ; NA@@ ME@@ gt ; and value &amp; lt ; VA@@ LU@@ E@@ gt ; add to the X@@ SL environment variables . see also the documentation for command &quot; add@@ par@@ am &quot;
if the conversion is 20 times , if --@@ repeat is two times rated , the conversion is executed 100 times
the input documents are treated as HTML files if the support for this is enabled in lib@@ x@@ ml .
activ@@ ates the X@@ Inclu@@ de processing of the input document when the support for this is enabled in lib@@ x@@ ml . that is turned on as default
on systems with re@@ ad@@ line library installed , you can use the arrow keys to sc@@ roll through the memory of the previously executed commands .
several commands require more than one argument . quot@@ ation marks can be used to pass composite expressions as an argument . &amp; eg ; : with the command &quot; break &amp; quot ; * _ BAR _ @ quot ; &quot; as argument is set a holding point in a file called &quot; break &amp; quot ; * _ BAR _ @ quot ; . &quot;
template _ NA@@ ME : a valid name of a template that consists only of the ASCII characters 0x@@ 00 to 0x@@ 7@@ F . this name can be a fully qualified name such as &quot; x@@ s@@ l : tem@@ plat@@ e@@ Name . &quot;
fil@@ ename : a valid local fil@@ ename on the user &apos;s system . on Unix or Cy@@ g@@ Win systems , the name may have the pre@@ fix &quot; ~ &quot; as a short form for the personal folder . on R@@ IS@@ C @-@ OS systems additional environment variables are allowed .

there are many graphical tools for comparing . why so &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ? let me briefly explain why I wrote .
the merge was very complicated because one of the contribut@@ ors had made many changes and at the same time corrected the ind@@ entation at many places . another progra@@ mmer had changed a lot of text in the same file . the result was numerous conflicts during mer@@ ging .
the program I used showed me only the changed lines , but I couldn &apos;t see exactly what changed within these lines . and there was no indication of the places where maybe only the ind@@ entation had changed . mer@@ ging these changes was a small night@@ mare .
this was the beginning . the first version of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; could display differences within a line and changes to white characters . later , a lot of other useful functions were added .
for example , if you want to compare text quickly , simply copy it to the clip@@ board and insert it in one of the comparison windows .
a function that made a lot of work was the compar@@ isons and mer@@ ging of folders . this function changed &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; almost in a full @-@ fle@@ dged file browser .
this is useful when two people work independently of one piece of code and make changes . the original file ( the base ) helps &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the merge editor under the differences window allows you to edit the result directly . in this editor you can even edit the result directly . the scre@@ enshot shows three source files when mer@@ ging :
&amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; also helps you to compare and merge complete folders . this scre@@ enshot shows &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; when folder merge :
&amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; display the exact differences and refer to the possibilities of today &apos;s color monitors . if you frequently need to check code , you will like this feature .
differences in white characters and tab@@ s are displayed visi@@ bly . if lines only differ in a certain number of white characters , one can see at a glance at the summary in the column at the left side . ( no more trouble if someone changes the ind@@ entation . )
if a file is the same , and the other is different in one line , then the color indicates which file is different . red color means that both files differ .
if all files have the same name but are in different folders , then you can make the typ@@ ing work easier by writing only the file name of the first file . example :
k@@ diff@@ 3 Ord@@ ner@@ 2 k@@ diff@@ 3 folder 1 folder 2 -@@ o target folder k@@ diff@@ 3 folder 1 folder 2 folder 3 k@@ diff@@ 3 folder 1 folder 2 folder 3 -@@ o target folder
the Open dialog allows manual typ@@ ing of file names , selecting the file browser ( file ... ) or selecting a last opened file from the drop @-@ down list . the opening dialog will remember your selection and will display it next time . you don &apos;t have to specify a third file ; if you leave the entry for C , the analysis of the differences with two files is performed .
through the Fol@@ der folder ... you can also select a folder . if you select a folder , the comparison or merge of folders will be started . if A file is selected for A , however , for B and C , a folder , then used &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the fil@@ ename from A in the two other folders .
when mer@@ ging is enabled , the input field is active for target and can be edited . however , it is not necessary to immediately specify an output file . you can do this step later when saving .
the Setup button opens a dialog with Settings . here you can set options before you start comparing / merge .
sometimes you do not want to compare a whole file , but only parts of a text . &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; allows you to drag text parts from the clip@@ board into the active comparison window . the comparison then starts immediately . in the Open dialog , you do not have to select any files , you can simply close the dialog with the Canc@@ el button .
you can also use drag and drop : simply drag a file from a file manager or select text from an editor and drop it over a comparison window .
which idea is behind it ? sometimes a file contains e.g. several similar functions . if you want to find out how similar these functions are , it would be a relatively big effort . you would need to create two corresponding files , load them in &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; now you can simply copy , paste and then compare the relevant sections .
note : currently , you can remove nothing from &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; only the drop down of text in a comparison window will be supported .
warning : some editors interpret the drag and drop of text into another program than cut and paste ( instead of copy and paste ) . in such a case , your original data may be lost .
the info line of the source window contains the characters A , B or C , the file name and the line number of the first visible line in the window . ( note that Windows C is optional . ) Every info line has a different color . ( if the path to a file is too long , let the mouse rest for a while over the row . then a small auxiliary window will display the full name . )
the three source windows are the letters A , B and C assigned . a has the color blue , B the color green and C is mag@@ enta . ( these pres@@ ets can be changed using the Settings menu . )
when a difference is detected , one can see in the color which file differs . if both files differ , the default color is red . ( color for conflicts in the settings ) . the color scheme is particularly useful when comparing three files . that is good in the next section ( merge ) .
when differences are found , the column shows the corresponding color . if differences are not so important , the color is displayed . in some programming languages where white characters are not so important , it is useful to only see the relevant changes . ( for C / C + + , for example , white characters are only relevant in strings and comments , for the pre @-@ processor and in few , rare individual cases . )
the vertical line separ@@ ating the summary column from the text is interrupted at places where the respective source file has no lines . if the line break is enabled , the line is dotted with broken lines .
the results window ( among the comparison windows ) also has an info line with the in@@ scription Issu@@ e : , the fil@@ ename and &#91; changes &#93; if you edited the result . usually it contains text , but often it also contains conflicts .
! ! ! until all conflicts are resolved , the Save is disabled ! ! ! ( use the Spr@@ inge keys to the next dissolved / un@@ resolved conflict to find the remaining conflicts . )
if only two comparison windows are used , each difference is at the same time a conflict that needs to be solved manually .
by clicking with the left mouse button in one of the windows , the group belonging to the row is marked in all windows and the first line of the group is displayed . ( this will also cause a jump in the position in the windows where the beginning of the group would otherwise not be visible . ) This group will then be highlighted with the color background color for current pane and a black bar appears on the left respectively .
sometimes there is no more line left in the group by automatic mer@@ ging or by manual editing ; this is only a plac@@ eholder in the case that you change your mind and perhaps choose another source . this text will not appear in the final saved file , nor in a marker that you might copy and paste somewhere else .
the text &amp; lt ; merge conflict ; however , appears in the clip@@ board when you copy this text from the result window . be careful with this function .
note : when selecting the sources ignor@@ ing the options or Ign@@ ore C / C + + comments enabled , changes in numbers or comments will also be treated as white characters .
navigate mainly with the sc@@ roll bars and mouse but you can also use the keyboard . if you click in one of the windows , you can use the arrow keys to the left , right , high , down , side up , side down , beginning , end , C@@ trl @-@ start and C@@ trl @-@ End , Si@@ w as you can also use it from other programs .
in the output window , you can also use the other buttons to edit . with the Insert key , you can switch between insert and over@@ write mode . ( default is insert mode . )
one click with the left mouse button in one of the summar@@ ies synchron@@ izes the view of all windows to the beginning of each group ( as explained in the merge operation and the edi@@ table output window ) .
the tool@@ bar contains seven buttons to navigate to the next / previous difference ( C@@ trl @-@ down / C@@ trl @-@ Up ) , to the next / previous conflict ( C@@ trl @-@ Down / C@@ trl @-@ picture down ) or to the next / previous un@@ resolved conflict . note that all non @-@ automatically solved conflicts are still considered as conflict . therefore , between resolved and un@@ resolved conflicts must be distinguished .
to copy the mark to the clip@@ board , you need to press the Copy button ( C@@ trl @-@ C or C@@ trl @-@ Insert ) . if this is enabled , whatever you select is automatically copied to the clip@@ board and the manual copying is om@@ itted . however , be careful with this option because you could acci@@ dentally over@@ write the clip@@ board content .
line ends are stored according to the underlying operating system . Unix flavors use a new@@ line \ , and Win32 @-@ based systems use cart return + new@@ line \ \ r \ . K@@ Diff@@ 3 does not keep the line end of the source files , so you should not use &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; also not with binary files .
the options and the list of recently used files will be automatically saved upon exit and restored at the next start . ( menu Sett@@ ing@@ s- &gt; K@@ Diff@@ 3 set up ... )
choose a font with a fixed width . ( on some systems , the dialog also provides fonts with variable width to choose from , but you should not use them . )
if you enable this option , differences are displayed in ital@@ ics . if the selected font does not support this display , nothing happens at all .
on systems with only 16 or 256 colors , some colors could not be available in their pure form but would be rendered scann@@ ed . on these systems , the Pre@@ ferences button automatically introduces an un@@ just color .
when this option is checked , pressing the Tab key will insert the corresponding number of spaces . otherwise a tab character will be inserted .
when you press Enter or Return , the ind@@ entation of the previous line will be automatically used for the next line .
when this option is checked , each selection is automatically copied to the clip@@ board . copying the manual to the clip@@ board is no longer necessary .
you can select which line end type you prefer for saving . the default value is the generally usual selection on the used operating system .
comparing files attempts &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; first , all completely identical lines can be found in the source files . only during this first step white characters can be ignored . in this step white characters are ignored . even when mer@@ ging white characters are not ignored .
some editors ( on some systems ) store a carriage return character \ \ r &apos; and a new@@ line \ &apos; at the end of a line , while others may be identical in the page @-@ to @-@ page comparison , although they are different . if this option is checked , this option will be disabled , but this option must be disabled during the merge operation .
in the first part of the analysis , numbers and corresponding characters ( &apos; 0 &apos; - &apos; 9 &apos; , &apos; . &apos; , &apos; - &apos; ) are ignored . in result , the differences are still displayed , but they are treated like white signs .
by default , this option is disabled . changes in comments are treated as changes in white characters .
search intensively for even smaller differences . the option is enabled by default . it is effective in complicated and large files , but slow with very large files .
in automatic ski@@ pping mode , this setting determines how long the result of the selection will be shown before the next un@@ resolved conflict will continue .
resol@@ ves automatic conflicts in white characters by using the selected file as source . ( default is manual selection . ) That is useful if white characters in many files are less important . if you only need this from time to time , use better the Select A / B / C functions for all un@@ resolved white conflicts resulting from the merge menu . note that the options ignore numbers or Ign@@ ore C / C + + comments are activated .
these options are dealt with in the chapter on the scanning of folders and performing a merge operation . see documentation for directory comparison and merge operation for details .
if a file is stored and already an older version exists , then the original version is the suff@@ ix .@@ orig . if already such a backup file with the suff@@ ix .@@ orig exists , it will be deleted without further f@@ use .
adap@@ ts the language of the user interface . changing this option does not affect the currently running program . you have to &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; exit and restart to make the change active . ( this option is not available in the K@@ DE version of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; not available because the language is set there globally via the control centre . )
the following encoding settings can be set separately for each entry . if you activate this option , the top setting is used for all entries .
over the selection fields for encoding , a short notice appears , which is the local encoding . ( this cannot be changed here and has purely informal character for you . )
adjust the file encoding for source files . this affects how special characters are treated and interpreted . since coding for each file is individually adjustable , even files with different coding can be compared and merged .
if you have edited a file , you can specify which encoding to store .
if you define default commands , you might not be able to work with your code@@ c . ( for example , your files may be 16 @-@ bit Uni@@ code , but the pre @-@ processing command can only handle 8 @-@ bit ASCII . ) With this option you can specify the encoding of the output of pre @-@ processing commands .
turn this off to supp@@ ress changes in white characters in text or review columns . ( note : this also applies to changes in numbers or comments if the options ignore numbers or Ign@@ ore C / C + + comments are enabled . )
this selection is only available if you compare three files . in normal mode all differences are shown in a color coded hyper@@ text column . but sometimes you might want to see only the differences between two of three files . after choosing A &amp; lt ; -@@ gt ; C or B &amp; lt ; -@@ gt ; C will be displayed next to the normal still a second over@@ sight column with the required information .
sometimes you prefer to use the available space on the screen for long lines . simply shut@@ down the less important windows . ( this option is in the window menu . )
arrange the comparison window next to each other or over each other . this can also be useful for displaying long lines . ( this option is in the window menu . )
sometimes you look at the differences and then decide un@@ expect@@ edly to merge the files . a simple click starts the merge and uses the file name of the last source file as pre @-@ set name for the output file . ( if this function is used to restart the merge , the name of the last used output file will be retained . )
when reading a file , it will first pass it to this external command . in &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 , then the output of the command will be visible , and not the file itself . you can write your own pre @-@ processor that matches your requirements . you can use this function e.g. to cut out dis@@ rup@@ tive parts or to correct the ind@@ entation .
when reading a file , it will first pass it to this external command . if a normal pre @-@ processing command is also specified ( see above ) , the output of the command is used only at the time line . you can write your own pre @-@ processor that matches your requirements . each input line must have a corresponding output line .
the idea behind it is to give the user more flexibility when setting up the diff results . however , an external program is required and most users do not want to program it themselves . however , the good news is that in most cases sed or per@@ l is sufficient .
use this pre @-@ processing command for new@@ lines to convert the input into upper@@ case letters : SE@@ D &apos;s / \ \ ( . * \ \ ) / \ \ U \ \ 1 / &apos; This . * is an erg@@ ular expression that matches all characters in a line . the \ \ U converts the found text into upper@@ case letters .
CV@@ S and other version control systems use some keywords to insert automatically generated strings ( info : / c@@ vs / Key@@ word sub@@ stitution ) . all follow the same pattern $ keyword / \ \ \ \ \ ( BAR _ Date \ \ ) . * \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \
while you experiment with sed , you may start to understand it and maybe you may even like those regular expressions . they are very useful because there are many programs that support very similar things .
ignor@@ ing numbers is actually an already built @-@ in feature in K@@ Diff@@ 3 . but it is good as an example for another pre @-@ processing command for line devi@@ ation@@ . sed &apos;s / &#91; 0@@ 12@@ 345@@ 67@@ 8@@ 9.@@ - &#93; / / g &apos; Every sign between &apos; &#91; &apos; and &apos; &#93; &apos; is a hit , and each hit is replaced by nothing , so virtually deleted .
sometimes you might want to perform several sub@@ stitu@@ tions at one time . then you can use the sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on &apos; ; &apos; to separate the plac@@ ements from each other . for example :
instead of sed you can also use something else such as per@@ l -@@ p -@@ e &apos;s / RE@@ GE@@ XP / replacement / SCH@@ AL@@ TER &apos; Ho@@ wever , per@@ l some details are different . where sed \ \ ( and \ \ ) needs , per@@ l needs only ( and ) without the previous \ \ &apos; . example :
the data after the normal pre @-@ processor is maintained for the display and mer@@ ging . the other operations only change the data that the line balance al@@ gor@@ y@@ th@@ mus sees .
note : in rare cases when using a normal pre @-@ processor , the new@@ line pre@@ processor sees the output of the normal pre@@ processor as input .
the pre @-@ processor commands are very useful , but as with any function that changes text or hidden differences , you may acci@@ dentally notice certain differences and in the worst case destroy important data .
often , programm@@ ers need to edit many files in a folder . for this reason , you can compare and merge with &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; complete folders recur@@ sively .
... makes a proposal for each object to merge ; you can adjust the suggestion before starting ,
... can simul@@ ate mer@@ ging and display simul@@ ated changes without really performing it ,
... perform selected actions either with all ( F@@ 7 key ) , or only with the selected objects ( F@@ 6 key ) ,
this is very similar to comparing and mer@@ ging single files . you only need to specify folders on the command line or in the File dialog .
if three folders are merged , then folder 1 is used as a base . if no destination folder is specified , &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; folder 3 as target folder .
note that only the comparison of folders starts automatically , not mer@@ ging . to start mer@@ ging , you need to select the appropriate menu entry or press the F@@ 7 key . ( follow more details . )
when you read the folder , you will be informed by a small message window on the current progress . if you cancel the scan , only the files that were compared until then are listed .
when the folder is scann@@ ed , displays &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; a list window with the results on the left side , ...
each file and folder found during the scan is displayed here in a tree . you can select an object with a simple mouse click .
the folder structure is usually folded together . you can open a folder by clicking on + / - , or double @-@ clicking on the object , or by clicking on the arrow keys for left / right . the directory menu includes two functions to open all sub@@ directories and open all sub@@ directories with which you can open or fold all folders .
when you double @-@ click on a file , the file comparison is started and a comparison window appears .
the name in the Name column reflects the file type in the first folder ( A ) . these types are possible :
if the file type is different in the other folders , this is visible in the A / B / C columns and in the details pane to the selected object . in such a case , the merge operation cannot be selected automatically . if the merge operation is started , you will be informed about problems of this type again .
as shown in the picture above , the colors red , green , yellow and black are used in columns A / B / C .
with identical entries the color is also identical , even if the age of the entries varies .
folders are considered identical when their entire content is identical . then also folders have the same color . at folders , the age is ir@@ relevant for its color .
the idea for this color scheme is based on dir@@ diff . the colors reflect the colors of a leaf again , which is only green , then yellow and later , when it is old , becomes red .
... A and C are identical , but not B : copy of B ( or if B does not exist , delete the target if it exists )
... A and B are identical , but not C : copy C ( or if C does not exist , delete the target if it exists )
... B and C are identical , but not A : copy of A ( or if A does not exist , delete the target if it exists )
... A , B and C do not have the same type of file ( e.g. if A is a file and B file ) : error : conf@@ lic@@ ting file types . as long as such faul@@ ty objects exist , the merge cannot be started .
... A and B do not have the same type of file ( e.g. if A is a file and B file ) : error : conf@@ lic@@ ting file types . as long as such faul@@ ty objects exist , the merge cannot be started .
the synchron@@ ize mode is active if only two folders and no explicit target folder are specified , and if the option directories are synchron@@ ized active . then select &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; select the necessary action so that afterwards both folders are identical . if for one entry ...
... A and B exist , but not identical : merge and save the result in both folders . ( the user sees as visible fil@@ ename for the output file only B ; directly copied and c@@ diff@@ 3 ; B to A. )
if two folders are merged and select the newer file instead of merge ( in@@ secure ) , then check &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the date of the files and suggest a newer file for copying . if the files are different , but the same date appears , error message appears : files are different , but the date is identical .. If such errors are not fixed , the merge of the folder cannot be started .
when mer@@ ging , a file is processed after the other . it indicates that if the merge operation was successful , and corresponding to other messages when something unexpected appeared . if the merge is complete , you should make a final check and see if the status is all right .
if full analysis is selected in the setup dialog , K@@ Diff@@ 3 will display more columns . these contain the number of un@@ resolved , resolved , non @-@ white and white conflicts . ( the column for resolved conflicts only appears when three folders are compared or merged . )
you can either merge the selected entry ( file or folder ) , or all entries at once . if you have selected all the merge actions ( even in all sub@@ folders ) , you can start mer@@ ging .
please note : if you do not specify a destination folder , then C will be used as a destination in the Three @-@ Fol@@ der merge mode . B is chosen as a destination in the two @-@ folders merge operation , and A and / or B will be used as the target for syn@@ cing .
if you have selected a destination folder , please check that all entries should be within the target folder , also displayed in the folder structure . there are some options ski@@ pped by the specified entries . check these options to avoid unpleasant surprises :
to merge all entries , select start / continue in the folder menu or press F@@ 7 ( short@@ cut ) . to only merge the current entry : select action of the current element or press F@@ 6 .
if invalid mer@@ ging actions still exist by conf@@ lic@@ ting file types , a message appears that points to the faul@@ ty elements . you can then select a valid action for them .
when you merge all entries , a dialog box appears with options Per@@ forming , Sim@@ ulating and Canc@@ el .
select Sim@@ ulate if you first want to see what would happen without the really changes made . you will then get a detailed list of all actions .
&amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; then execute certain actions with all entries . if a manual intervention is necessary ( merge a single file ) , then a merge window opens ( note the scre@@ enshot ) .
when you are finished with a file , select / continue or press F@@ 7 . if you haven &apos;t saved yet , a corresponding dialog will appear . then &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; its work continues with the next entry .
if &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; at the end of the list you will see some error messages that will help you eliminate the cause of the problem . if you continue mer@@ ging ( F@@ 7 key ) , leave &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; you have the option to try another action for the entry or to solve the problem in a different way before you continue with mer@@ ging .
if some entries have been merged individually , you notice &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; these entries ( in the current session ) and do not merge them together at the later merge of all entries . even if the merge has been ski@@ pped or not saved , these entries are considered settled . only if you change the merge operation , these entries will be merged again .
the Settings menu of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; ( Settings - &gt; K@@ Diff@@ 3 set up ... ) now has a section called directory merge with these options :
only files that match the specified pattern are displayed in the element tree . you can enter multiple patterns . separate the patterns with a sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ; . valid wild@@ card : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . ( e.g. * .@@ c@@ pp ; * .@@ h ) . the default is * . folders must not match this pattern .
files and folders that match this pattern are not displayed in the element tree . it can be more than one pattern entered , use the sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ; as a separ@@ ator . valid wild@@ card : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . default is * .@@ original ; * .@@ o .
files and folders that match this pattern are not displayed in the element tree . it can be more than one pattern entered , use the sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ; as a separ@@ ator . valid wild@@ card : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . default is * .@@ original ; * .@@ o .
ignored files that would also be ignored by CV@@ S . many aut@@ mati@@ cally created files are ignored by CV@@ S . the big advantage is that this can be configured specifically with a .@@ c@@ v@@ sign@@ ore file . ( see info : / c@@ vs / c@@ v@@ sign@@ ore . )
in some file systems , files have an extension attribute . in other file systems , a leading dot will mark a file as hidden . this option lets you decide if these files should be displayed in the element tree or not . this option is turned on in default .
for links to files : if the option is disabled , symbolic links are compared . if the option is enabled , the files will be compared to which the links show . this is disabled by default .
if the option is disabled , the symbolic links will be compared . if the option is turned on , the links will be treated as normal folders and search recur@@ sively . ( note that &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; do not examine possible recur@@ sions . a link to a folder containing a link to itself would lead to an infinite loop and &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; cr@@ ashes . ) This option is disabled in default .
performs a full analysis of each file and displays statistics columns . ( the number of resolved , un@@ resolved , non @-@ white and white conflicts . ) The full analysis is slower than a simple binary analysis , and much slower when applied to files containing no text . ( enter a corresponding anti @-@ sample . )
if you compare large folders across a slow network , it may be faster to compare only the modification date and file size . however , this speed advantage will cost you a certain level of security . please use caution with caution . this option is switched off in default .
simil@@ arity to the change date . no real comparison takes place . the files are considered identical if they are equally large . this may be useful , for example , when copying the modification date has been lost . please use caution . this option is switched off in default .
activ@@ ates the sync mode when two folders are compared and no destination folder has been specified . in this mode , the suggestions for mer@@ ging are selected so that afterwards both folders are identical . also the results of mer@@ ging files are stored in both folders . this option is disabled in default .
if there are differences , copying the newer file will be proposed as an action instead of mer@@ ging ( this is considered uns@@ af@@ e because it assumes that the other file has not been modified too . you should check this in any case . ) This option is disabled in default .
if a file or folder is replaced or deleted by another , then the original version is ren@@ amed and receives the extension .@@ original If an old backup file already exists with the .@@ orig extension , it will be deleted without further backup . this also affects the normal mer@@ ging of individual files , not only mer@@ ging entire folders .
normally , the folder merge view is visible during mer@@ ging single files ; you can drag the window divi@@ der with the mouse . if you do not want this , you can disable the default window in the windows menu and switch between the two views using the switch between the directory and the text window .
probably you prefer to compare a file simply by double @-@ clicking . nevertheless , there is a corresponding menu entry in the directory menu . you can also merge a single file directly without having to run the folder . to do this , use the current file merge from the merge menu . once you save the result , the status will be set to ser@@ mon and the file will not be merged once you start the folder .
however , this status is lost when you re @-@ read the directory : directory men@@ ue : re @-@ read
K@@ DE supports network transparency with the help of K@@ IO slaves . K@@ DE uses this to read files and folders . this allows you to specify files and folders to open , which are located on local or remote hosts .
the first command line compar@@ es a local file with one on an FTP server . the second command line compar@@ es a folder inside a compressed archive with a local folder .
a URL has a different syntax than local files and folders . a few things you should consider :
a path can be relative and@@ . or .. contain . this is not possible with URLs , these are always absolute .
special characters must be escaped . ( # - &gt; % 23 , spaces &gt; % 20 , etc . ) . for example , a file named / # fo@@ o # the URL file : / % 23@@ fo@@ o % 23 .
sometimes due to the fil@@ esystem on the server , sometimes by the protocol used . it follows a short list of limitations :
or it cannot be distinguished whether a link identi@@ fies a file or folder . then a file is always assumed as a link target . ( FTP : , s@@ ft@@ p : ) .
there is no possibility to edit per@@ missions or modification dates . therefore , the per@@ missions or modification date devi@@ ate from the original . ( note the option Con@@ fi@@ denti@@ al of size . ) ( This is only possible for local files . )
the main purpose of use is currently the differences viewer in K@@ DE@@ V@@ EL@@ OP . K@@ DE@@ V@@ EL@@ OP always starts the built @-@ in differences viewer . to start K@@ Diff@@ 3 , press the right mouse button above the difference viewer and then select In K@@ Diff@@ 3@@ Part display from the context menu .
normally , &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; two complete input files . if it is used as a part , it takes &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; that the input file is a patch file in unified format . then it removes &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the name of the original files from the patch file . then start &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the patch program patch to restore the missing file .
in Kon@@ quer@@ or , you can click on a patch file and select from the preview in - K@@ Diff@@ 3@@ Part . please note that this does not work if none of the original files exists . furthermore , this is un@@ reliable if the original files have changed since the patch file has been created .
when &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; as part is executed , it only supports compar@@ isons between two files , a very small tool@@ bar and menu . mer@@ ging or compar@@ isons of folders is not supported in the K@@ Part mode .
tools with the name K@@ Di@@ ff and K@@ Diff@@ 2 ( now called Com@@ are ) already exist . furthermore , the name K@@ Diff@@ 3 already indicates that it can merge as the program diff@@ 3 from the diff tool collection .
I use G@@ PL @-@ programs for a very long time and learned a lot by looking into the sources of other programs . this is my thank you to all programm@@ ers who have gone this way or let him go like that .
you compiled the program from the sources and probably not told the configure script to K@@ DE . in default configure installed in / usr / local , but then K@@ DE cannot find resources for the user interfaces ( e.g. k@@ diff@@ 3@@ u@@ i.@@ rc ) . in the RE@@ A@@ DM@@ E file you will find more information on this topic .
if only the number of white characters is different , these lines are treated first as identical ; however , if only a non @-@ white character is different , the line will be treated as non @-@ identical . if similar lines , next to each other , this will be the sign to this and is often the case .
the editor notes each difference in the files where it starts and where it ends . this is necessary to solve a conflict simply by clicking in the source code and selecting the button A / B / C . however , this important information is lost if the result is simply saved as a text file and it is too much effort to create an extra file format that could store this information .
the expense for this was too large so far . you can always restore a certain version by selecting a source A / B / C . to edit larger quantities of text , another editor should be used .
after removing text is suddenly lt ; No src rel@@ eg@@ ated ; appeared and the text won &apos;t be deleted . what does that mean and how can that be removed ?
&amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; use already many colors to highlight differences . even more high@@ lighting would be conf@@ using and mis@@ ses the purpose . please use another editor for this purpose .
many good ideas and bug reports came from colleagues and many people from Wild Wild web . thank you !
to use all functions of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 , you need &amp; k@@ de ; 3.1 or later .
information on how to use K@@ DE on other platforms without K@@ DE can be found on the homepage .
a list of the latest changes can be found under htt@@ p : / / k@@ diff@@ 3.@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net / Ch@@ ange@@ Log or in the Ch@@ ange@@ Log file in the source package .
to &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; to compile and install on a system with &amp; k@@ de ; use the following command in the base folder of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; -@@ Distribution :
K@@ DE @-@ dir sets the folder in your system where K@@ DE is installed . if you are unsure , you will find further details in the RE@@ A@@ DM@@ E file .
da &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; auto@@ conf and autom@@ ake used , you should not have any problems while comp@@ iling . however , if difficulties pers@@ ist , please report to the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ mailing lists of it .
cut out ( C@@ trl @-@ X or Shift @-@ Rem@@ ove ) copied to the clip@@ board and del@@ etes the selected text . insert ( C@@ trl @-@ V or Shift @-@ Insert ) inserts the text from the clip@@ board to the current cur@@ sor position or replaces the current marker .
show only differences : files that are identical in all folders will not appear in the folder structure , and therefore not in the target folder .
( in the current program version , you will need to re @-@ read the folder with the Update function after changes to these options . )
only entries will appear which show differences . this also leads to identical files not being copied to the destination folder . if the destination folder does not already contain these files , they will be missing after the merge operation . ( the behavior will probably be modified in a later program version . ) This option is disabled in default .
note the buttons to select the source with the label A , B and C below the menu bar . if you click on one of the buttons , the lines from the corresponding window will be app@@ ended to the end of the selected group in the results window ( if they are not already present ) . if the lines are already present , they will be removed when clicking the button .
in default , this option is disabled . differences in individual characters ( such as &apos; A &apos; and &apos; a &apos; ) are treated like differences in white characters .
the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; shows a thumb@@ nail of all virtual des@@ kt@@ ops . it is quite handy to see the running programs on the working areas , change their size , stop them or move them . this works both within a desktop and at several .
the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; can display all virtual des@@ kt@@ ops as well as the applications running in it . applications can be selected and moved even on the desktop and to others .
with the middle mouse button , windows can be moved within &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; the movement is possible within a desktop as well as on other working areas .
the context menu depends on where the right mouse button is cli@@ cked : if on the empty background of &amp; K@@ p@@ ager , the context menu only has the two entries P@@ ager set up ... and ends . if , however , click on an application within &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; then , the icon and the name of the application as well as the entries are minim@@ ized , maxim@@ ize , on Desktop and Finish .
maxim@@ izes the application window to the full size of the desktop . only appears when cli@@ cked on an application .
sends the application to the selected virtual desktop . only appears when cli@@ cked on an application .
if this check box is selected , windows inside the &amp; p@@ ager can be moved with the middle mouse button on the desktop and also to other working areas .
when this field is crossed , the name of the virtual des@@ kt@@ ops will be shown in the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager .
tick this field allows the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager to display the numbers of virtual des@@ kt@@ ops . if it is crossed together with name , the names are provided with folder numbers , &amp; eg ; 1st desktop .
when this field is crossed , the background of each desktop is displayed as background in &amp; p@@ ager .
when this field is crossed , the running programs are displayed as small windows in the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; otherwise , only the empty working areas are displayed to enable them to be selected .
here the view of the program window is selected . simply shows simple rec@@ tan@@ gles with the proportions of the program window . icon shows the windows with their standard icon and Pix@@ map shows a small view of the real program window . note : Pix@@ map is only recommended for very fast systems .
here the arrangement of the &amp; p@@ ager ; main window can be determined : classic lets &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; in a 2x@@ N grid , as is known from p@@ ager applications in some other window managers ; horizont@@ ally shows all virtual des@@ kt@@ ops in a horizontal and vertical row in a vertical row , which is very good for displaying on the side of the desktop .
the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; can be used as an alternative to the P@@ ager miniature program in the Control Panel . it has the advantage that it can be changed in size , displaying and moving the windows as symbols or with its content . furthermore , it runs out of the control bar .
right click within &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; and set up switch settings ... let the Settings dialog appear .
currently , this cannot be changed in the Settings dialog . however , you can do this manually :
open the file $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / config / k@@ pag@@ err@@ c with any text editor such as &amp; ke@@ dit ; or vi@@ . If you do not have a write permission for the file , you must log in as user root or log in to your system administrator . in this file you must enter the key win@@ do@@ w@@ Transpar@@ ent mode and assign it a value . possible values are :
da &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; part of the k@@ de@@ base package , you will need a functioning installation of the K@@ DE basic packages .

&amp; k@@ like ; is a screen lu@@ pe . you can use &amp; k@@ like ; a part of the screen , as if you read a magni@@ fying glass for the small print or the exact viewing of a photo . this application is interesting for different users : these include artists , web designers and people with a visual impair@@ ment . this documentation is intended to be a complete manual for use of &amp; quot ; .
&amp; k@@ mag ; is a very powerful application that is constantly expanded with new functions . it is optimized for use on high @-@ performance computers .
if you like &amp; k@@ like ; start , a window appears as shown above . the main window of &amp; k@@ mag ; shows the enlarged area of the screen . below , this window is called a magni@@ fying window . the image that appears in the magni@@ fication window is an enlarged area of the screen and is referred to as a selection box below .
the default setting increases &amp; k@@ like ; the area around the mouse poin@@ ter as a moving magni@@ fying glass . alternatively , you can &amp; k@@ like ; for this cause a select screen area in the magni@@ fying window ( drop @-@ down mode ) or the surroundings of the mouse poin@@ ter at the edge of the screen ( eg ; at the left edge of the screen ) .
if you want to avoid that the mouse cur@@ sor is displayed in the enlarged window , select the setting of the mouse poin@@ ter . please note that the mouse poin@@ ter is not yet able to recognize the shape of the mouse poin@@ ter . this is always the default k ; / Q@@ t ; mouse poin@@ ter .
in the selection mode , you can customize the selection window to your own needs . you can move it with the arrow and mouse buttons and change its size . this can be done in the following way :
move the mouse cur@@ sor in the magni@@ fying window and hold the left mouse button pressed , so you can capture and move the contents of the magni@@ fying window . this also goes with the arrow keys .
if you additionally press the &amp; Shift key , press the &amp; M@@ MB ; you can move the selection window .
with this combination you can change the size of the selection window . note that the top left corner of the selection window stays fixed and only the bottom right corner is to move .
&amp; k@@ like ; has a lot of functions . you can send the enlarged picture directly to the printer , store into a file , copy to the clip@@ board ( to insert it later into other applications ) , rotate the picture and more .
stops or stop the ad update . stopping the update brings the needed CPU time to 0 .
select the update rate ( Very low , Ger@@ ing , Medium , High , Very High ) . the higher the update rate , the more CPU time is needed .
in this mode , a selection window will be shown . the selected area will be shown in a window .
&amp; k@@ like ; automatically uses your set short commands to store files , open a new window , print , rel@@ o@@ ad ( with the button document again in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; ) , En@@ large , and Res@@ ize &amp; etc ; .
k@@ art also known as &amp; k@@ magni@@ fier ; you can &amp; k@@ magni@@ fier ; you can use &amp; k@@ magni@@ fier ; you can use a magni@@ fier to view the small print in a newspaper or photo . this application is useful for different people : from research or artist to web designer or visually imp@@ aired .

&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; em@@ ulate a mouse click as soon as the mouse cur@@ sor remains on the same spot for a while . it is meant to help people who suffer from R@@ SI syndrome ( re@@ peti@@ tive Stra@@ in In@@ jury syndrome ) and which each mouse click prepares pain .
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; em@@ ulate a mouse click as soon as the mouse cur@@ sor remains on the same spot for a while . it is meant to help people who suffer from the re@@ peti@@ tive Stra@@ in In@@ jury ( R@@ SI ) syndrome and which each mouse click prepares pain .
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; can handle the pain caused by the mouse click and helps so many people to use the computer without any pain . unfortunately , pain caused by the use of your computer can also be caused by a doctor if this is not yet done .
to make it clear again : even if &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; avoid pain caused by clicking with the mouse , it is useless against pain caused by moving the mouse . and as with all ergonomic tools , the result may be different for everyone .
the use of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; is simple : &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; monitors your mouse movements and exec@@ utes a mouse click as soon as you pause the movement briefly .
if the smart move activ@@ ates , makes &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; a pause after it emul@@ ates pressing the mouse button . move now the mouse , wait until the release of the mouse button is executed . thus , you can drag the drag@@ ging with pressed mouse button . thus , you can drag the mouse with pressed mouse button .
this residence time must pass after the end of the mouse movement before &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; a mouse click performs .
if intelligent sliding is turned on , the rotation field is active ( 1 / 10 s ) . here , the time is set , the &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; after pressing the mouse button wait before it releases the mouse button again , if no moving of the mouse is in the meantime .
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; now supports clicking with mouse shift . if this function is enabled , a slow moving to the right and back , followed by a pause , a click with the right mouse button . this moves will be saved in the file $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / config / k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool _ stro@@ kes@@ .txt , but can be changed later .
if the sound appears delayed , you can make &amp; k@@ de ; to sh@@ orten the response time . to do so , open the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; , go to Sound &amp; Multimedia , select Sound System and here the rider Gener@@ el . there is a sli@@ der sound buffer that you can set to a lower value to sh@@ orten response times .
if this setting is selected , &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; at every start of &amp; k@@ de ; started . this function is currently only available at &amp; k@@ de ; for G@@ NO@@ ME or other window environments , please consult the respective documentation to find out how to start a program automatically .
reset all settings to the values that were set when opening the dialog . if you already pressed the Apply button , the settings will be reset to the status after the last press of the user .
best of all , use &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; first with the default settings . in particular , the smart move should be switched off first . if you have then used to the automatic mouse click , you can later increase the smart move .
if you are using the audi@@ ble click , it is necessary to decrease &amp; k@@ de response times if necessary .
first , you should be aware of which places a mouse click remains without effect : clicking on the neutral components of windows or in the browser window that does not contain a link does not cause unwanted reactions . you can therefore park your mouse in such places until you want to use them again .
when your mouse is ru@@ ck@@ ling , you should clean your mouse . this is usually quite simple . the trick here is that you do not only clean the mouse ball , but also the rolls that come into contact with the mouse globe .
first you have to take the mouse ball out . as this happens , mouse to mouse varies . but it should be quick to see if you look at the under@@ side of the mouse .
if you have removed the ball , you would have to see the reels . they are located at the sides of the hole in which the ball was inserted . you can easily scra@@ pe the dirt and the dirt with a flat blade or the finger nail .
in very rare situations , the operating system interrup@@ ts the execution of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; if you are using the smart move , this means that &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; the operation can no longer be termin@@ ated by letting the mouse button exit .
this happens when you use &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; use under another window manager and move a window .
the solution for this problem is that you can perform a click of a mouse . this makes the status of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; reset , and you can continue working as usual .
problem : if you enter text , try &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; continue to run mouse clicks and set the cur@@ sor to another place .
solution : use the mouse to place the cur@@ sor there where you want to have it . however , use the mouse on a neutral area of the desktop if you want to make a keyboard input . thus , you can &apos;t cause accidental moving of mouse &amp; eg ; secure zones for the mouse cur@@ sor are &amp; eg ; the gray areas around the tool@@ bars and menus and the head@@ lines of windows .
I try to work with the smart move , but I don &apos;t manage to edit lyrics .
the smart move is an advanced function of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; and it takes its time before you can handle it . it is very well possible to mark text , copy it to the clip@@ board , or execute any other action in which you want to move the mouse with pressed mouse button . however , it will probably cause you some problems . here are some advice :
do not use the smart move when you just start &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; use it as follows : at the end of the text area , press a mouse click and hold the Shift key pressed while you move the mouse poin@@ ter to the other end of the text and press the mouse button again .
use the audi@@ ble mouse click . thus , each time , when &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool , the mouse button pressed down a sound like a mouse click . thus , you know exactly when the shift time begins with smart move . later , you can also use the smart move without the audi@@ ble mouse click . but this requires some practice .
to use &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool , the X@@ Test extension must be installed for &amp; X Window ; this should already be the case on most of the system .
the functionality of the audi@@ ble mouse clicks is only available when the system has a sound card and speakers and are correctly set up .

&amp; mouth ; is a program that allows silent users to speak their computer for themselves .
with the program &amp; k@@ mouth , silent users can let the computer speak for themselves . the user can choose from a list with the conversation history sentences which are to be spoken again .
on the first page of the wiz@@ ard ( left scre@@ enshot ) enter the command that will later be used for the voice output of text . for more details , see the description of the setup dialog .
on the second page , select the default text pass@@ book . from the text passages you can often choose used text passages without typ@@ ing them . the text passages can of course be edited .
on the third page ( right scre@@ enshot ) you determine the dictionary for wor@@ d@@ search . &amp; mouth ; read the K@@ DE documentation of the selected language to determine the frequency of each word . in addition , you can offset the word lists using an Open@@ Offic@@ e.@@ org dictionary , so that only correctly sp@@ elled words can be added to the wor@@ d@@ get@@ ing .
the main window of &amp; k@@ mouth ; it is clear and contains essentially an input field for the keyboard input of your pro@@ positions ( the lower white field in the scre@@ enshot ) and a disk space memory of the already spoken phrases ( the upper white field in the scre@@ enshot ) .
if you have a mouth ; properly set up , you can enter the sentences you want to hear in the input field . each spoken set is app@@ ended to the oc@@ cl@@ usal memory . you can select sets that are to be spoken again .
with the menu entry Settings k@@ mouth ; set up ... open the Settings dialog from &amp; k@@ mouth ; This dialog contains two learning flash@@ cards , voice output and settings , the Wor@@ ter@@ fu@@ ge page as well as the page K@@ V@@ SD language service .
in the box of the Map Voice output , enter the command to call the language generator . in the selection field below the input field , specify the character encoding with which text is passed on to the language generator .
&amp; mouth ; knows two ways to pass the text . select the check box if the text is to be passed to the language generator as default input .
if the check box is not selected , the text will be passed as a parameter . you can use the following plac@@ eholders :
of course , the command to voice output depends on your voice generator . you will find this command in the documentation on your language generator . examples of this can be found in the App@@ endi@@ x .
use t@@ ts@@ d as a language service &amp; mouth ; first try to pass the text to the K@@ V@@ SD language service . if that is successful , the other settings on this page will be ignored . the ct@@ d language service is a &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ D@@ äm@@ on , der &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ applications a standar@@ dised interface for voice output is currently being developed . the choice of this option is useful even if K@@ V@@ SD is not installed .
with the first drop @-@ down sel@@ ector action after selecting a text passage you determine which action is triggered by the short@@ cut or by choosing a text passage in the Text passages text@@ book or in the bar for text passages .
with the selection of instant messages , the chosen text passage is spoken directly and additionally inserted into the course memory . with the selection of In the input field , the chosen text passage is entered only into the input field .
with the second drop @-@ down of the editing window for text passages , you can specify whether the text pass@@ code book should be saved automatically when closing the edit window .
save the book with the selection of text passages . if you choose to disc@@ ard changes , the text pass@@ code book will not be saved . select Before Save , will be &amp; k@@ mouth ; ask if the text pass@@ book should be saved .
the Wor@@ ter@@ gän@@ ger page contains a list of wor@@ d@@ search dic@@ tion@@ aries . in the main window beside the input field displays &amp; k@@ mouth ; a drop @-@ down box if this list contains more than one dictionary . with this selection box , you can choose the currently used dictionary for wor@@ dings .
with buttons on the right of the page you can delete or add dic@@ tion@@ aries , change the order of the books or export them to a file . below the list you can set the name and the language for the dictionary in the entry field .
select the desired language for this source ; &amp; mouth ; then read the &amp; k@@ de ; documentation . the frequency of each word is simply retri@@ eved by counting the occurrence . in addition , you can compare the word list with an Open@@ Offic@@ e.@@ org dictionary to insert only correctly written words into the new dictionary .
with this option you can merge the available dic@@ tion@@ aries . &amp; mouth ; then ask which dic@@ tion@@ aries are merged and how they should be weigh@@ ted .
this option allows you to create a new , empty dictionary with no entries . da &amp; k@@ mouth ; add newly entered words automatically into the dictionary , create a dictionary with your vocabulary in the course of time .
the main area of the window for editing text passages is divided . in the upper part , the text passages are displayed as tree structure .
in the bottom part you can edit a selected entry . if you have selected a text passage , you can change the text passage or the associated keyboard short@@ cut . if you have selected a text passage book , you can only change its name .
add actions such as new text passages or books , or delete selected text passages and books either by selecting in the menu bar , tool@@ bar or drop @-@ down menu .
the sequence of text passages or text passages can be changed by drag@@ ging with the mouse to the new location or using the arrow keys and the &amp; Alt ; key .
the selected text is cut out and copied to the clip@@ board . if a text section is selected in the input field , it will be used , otherwise the selected portions of the editor .
the selected text is copied to the clip@@ board . if a text section is selected in the input field , it will be used , otherwise the selected portions of the editor .
the currently active pro@@ position is spoken . if there is text in the input field , it will be used , otherwise the selected pro@@ positions will be used .
if this menu entry is selected , a sliding tool@@ bar is displayed with buttons for frequently used commands . by default , the tool@@ bar is placed directly under the menu bar by clicking on the left side and drag@@ ging the tool@@ bar to another place .
when this menu entry is selected , a narrow bar is displayed in the lower part of the main window displaying information about the state of &amp; mouth ; if not selected , this status bar is hidden .
if this menu entry is selected , a sliding bar for text passages is displayed with entries . by default , the bar is placed directly below the tool@@ bar above the editing pane . by clicking on the left side and drag@@ ging the tool@@ bar can be moved to another location .
you probably didn &apos;t have the command for the voice output properly or not completely entered . open Settings k@@ mouth ; set up ... , open the General Settings page and enter the command for voice output on the Map tab . ( see Settings dialog for Voice synthes@@ iz@@ ers for more details . )
Festival is a language edition system of the University of Edinburgh . currently only English , Spanish and Wel@@ sh are supported . the license allows to use festival for free and without further restrictions .
to display an example of the command line for setting the voice output , it is assumed that the festival is installed in the / usr / local / festival folder . the command for voice output is then :
Free@@ T@@ TS is an in &amp; Java ; written language generator . currently , it only supports the English pron@@ unci@@ ation . the license allows to use Free@@ T@@ TS free of charge and without further dis@@ semin@@ ating restrictions .
to display an example of the command line for setting up the voice output , it is assumed that Free@@ T@@ TS is installed in the directory / usr / local / fre@@ e.@@ The voice output is then possible with one of the three following command examples :
for the third example , the option must be switched on as default input . ( this is the recommended example of the application of Free@@ T@@ TS . )
MB@@ RO@@ LA is a language generator for many languages . it converts a list of phon@@ em@@ es into a wave file , so you need an additional program to break the text into phon@@ em@@ es . the license allows you to use MB@@ RO@@ LA for free for non @-@ commercial and non @-@ military applications .
in our example , H@@ adi@@ fax is used to convert German text into phon@@ em@@ es for MB@@ RO@@ LA , assuming that H@@ adi@@ fax and MB@@ RO@@ LA are installed in / usr / local / ha@@ fax and / usr / local / MB@@ RO@@ LA .
unfortunately , H@@ adi@@ fax rel@@ ishes the last character of the text so that an additional character has to be added . therefore , the full command is more complex than in the other examples :
( cat - ; echo quot ; &amp; quot ; ) _ BAR _ / usr / local / ha@@ fax / t@@ x@@ t@@ 2@@ ph@@ o -@@ f _ BAR _ / usr / local / MB@@ RO@@ LA / de@@ 1 / de@@ 1 - / tmp / t@@ mp@@ .@@ wa@@ v ; art@@ sp@@ lay / tmp / t@@ mp@@ .@@ wa@@ v ; r@@ m / tmp / t@@ mp@@ .@@ wa@@ v
all parts of the command must be written in one line . send the option data as default input .
the voice output dem@@ on by &amp; k@@ de ; ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) is a &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ further language service that provides all &amp; k@@ de ; applications a standard interface for voice output . K@@ V@@ SD is currently being developed in the SV@@ N . it uses modules to support different speech output systems .
since the adjustment of the language generator only takes place in the K@@ V@@ SD , you only have to use it as a language service in &amp; mouth ; set .
to setup , use the page K@@ TT@@ SD language service that appears in the Settings dialog from &amp; k@@ mouth ; appears when K@@ V@@ SD is installed .
to use it successfully , you need a language generator ( and of course &amp; k@@ de ; 3.@@ x ) . &amp; k@@ mouth ; needs about 15 MB memory ( and additionally memory for the language generator ) , but it depends on the individual of your computer and its configuration .
&amp; mouth ; is an application , with the people who cannot speak , can output text by the computer . a list of already spoken phrases is stored , which allows the user to spend time again and again .
note that there is no voice synthesis on the computer . a voice synthesis must be installed on the computer .

in addition to the Bug@@ z@@ illa database of &amp; k@@ de ; ( htt@@ p : / / bu@@ gs@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org / ) , you will find the mailing list on htt@@ ps : / / mail@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org / Mail@@ man / list@@ info / k@@ de @-@ accessibility . the developers can also find them at IR@@ C ( ir@@ c.@@ k@@ de@@ .org , channel # k@@ de @-@ accessibility ) .
before you can use &amp; kt@@ ats , you must install and set speech @-@ disp@@ at@@ cher program correctly .
at the first start of kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr or as long as no speakers are set up , the card card is displayed . see also . if you have at least one speaker installed , the map map is displayed . see .
most T@@ TS synthes@@ iz@@ ers offer different languages and voices , as well as different male or female , or those that differ in volume or speed . you can also specify multiple variants for a synthes@@ izer . you should at least set up a speaker before you start &amp; kt@@ ats ; otherwise , the program speed dis@@ pat@@ cher uses the standard speaker .
various speakers for the same synthes@@ izer are comparable to several printer spool seats for the same printer .
when you click on the map maker Spe@@ aker in kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr , the card card Spe@@ aker is displayed . this will also appear automatically when you start kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr and no speaker is set up yet .
all speakers already set up appear in this list . the preferred speakers will appear in the list above . the top speaker is used for voice output when an application does not provide a speaker .
with a mouse click , select a speaker from the list , and click on this button to remove the speaker from the list .
with a mouse click , select a speaker from the list , and click on this button to change the settings . see below .
select a speaker from the list with a mouse click and click on this button to post@@ p@@ one the speaker in the list a line further down . the order of the speakers in the list also determines their priority .
click on any of these buttons to apply your changes to the current &amp; ct system .
choose a vote type here , there are three male and three female voices as well as a boys and girls vote to choose from .
if you click here , the new speaker will appear on the card tab . to change the settings of this speaker , click Edit .
now you can use &amp; kt@@ ats ; almost use . go back to card general and check if voice output is enabled ( K@@ V@@ SD ) to start the T@@ TS service from &amp; k@@ de ; see . now you can use &amp; kt@@ ats ; click on the map map orders to create and manage text orders . see .
if you have at least one speaker , you can start the language output system from &amp; k@@ de ; click the General tab on the General tab to open this map . here you can set some general options .
select this check box to enable the K@@ DE T@@ TS service ( K@@ V@@ SD ) . if this start is successful , the card map will be displayed and you can create and read text orders . see . remove the marker , will stop K@@ V@@ SD and the T@@ TS system from &amp; k@@ de ; de@@ activated .
if kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr is termin@@ ated , runs &amp; kt@@ ats ; further , if the field En@@ able Language Output ( K@@ V@@ SD ) is enabled .
if this check box is selected and kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr automatically appears in the control bar system field when reading it , it disappears again as soon as the reading process is complete .
with buttons in this series you can start , cancel , stop and res@@ ume text orders .
with buttons in this series you can read the current text in the &amp; k@@ de ; clip@@ board or open a text file for reading . you can also change the speaker for one job .
click Apply or OK , then all changed settings will be taken on all sides .
the card @-@ card orders will only be shown when K@@ V@@ SD is started . to launch K@@ V@@ SD , click the General tab , and tick language output ( K@@ V@@ SD ) .
in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; , the web browser from &amp; k@@ de ; , you can read the text of the displayed website . then check the text that is to be read and select the Text to read in the main menu . after a short time , the speech output should begin .
it is almost always sensible to mark the desired text of a web page . you can ski@@ p this step also , but then many &amp; HTML ; he@@ aders and other invisible brands are also read .
in &amp; kate ; the extended text editor by &amp; k@@ de ; , you can read the displayed text . then check the text you want to read and select the Text to read in the main menu . then the speech output should start .
this also works if &amp; kate ; embedded in other applications , such as &amp; eg ; in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; or in &amp; Qu@@ anta ; .
K@@ noti@@ fy is the news system from &amp; k@@ de ; which noti@@ fies you of events that you specify . you can also read and read the text of these messages .
in &amp; Con@@ vers@@ ation ; , the IR@@ C program from &amp; k@@ de ; you can set up &amp; Con@@ vers@@ ation ; for example , you can set up a message to be notified when a message appears in an IR@@ C channel in which your nick@@ name occurs . with &amp; ct@@ ts ; you can then read the IR@@ C message text .
supports a &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ program K@@ Noti@@ fy , a menu entry appears in the Settings menu of this program . the possible settings for K@@ Noti@@ fy differ depending on the application .
the file k@@ mail@@ .x@@ ml , which is part of the delivery of &amp; kt@@ ats ; it is a good example . it removes the tags &lt; br and b from the messages sent by the mail , and also the expression / local / in@@ box , as it can be assumed in most cases as provided .
filters are one of the advanced capabilities of &amp; kt@@ at ; filter is not required for normal work .
text is processed in filters before being sent to the speech @-@ speech hand@@ ler . they are useful for improving pron@@ unci@@ ation in order to replace wrong spoken words or ab@@ brevi@@ ations , select a suitable language and nar@@ r@@ ator or to circum@@ vent certain flaws of voice synthesis and their voices .
in order to understand the functioning of filters , it is important to know how the program &quot; speech @-@ pat@@ cher &quot; works with a text . &amp; kt@@ ats ; distingu@@ ishes four types of texts .
the output of screen readers has the highest priority . it is preferred to all other orders and stops these orders . if the output of the screen reader is read , the reserved orders are res@@ um@@ ed .
warnings have the next priority . this level is important news such as &amp; eg ; processor is exc@@ essi@@ vely reserved . a warning has priority and keeps the output of messages and normal text .
messages have the next highest priority . a message interrup@@ ts normal text . &amp; mouth ; is an example of an application that uses messages . while you want to read a long text on a web page , you can be greeted with &amp; k@@ mouth ; noti@@ fications are also news .
the rest are simple text orders . every order you initiate from the map file is a text order . KS@@ ay@@ it is an example of a applications that uses text orders . text orders are intended for the output of longer texts that have no particular ur@@ gency .
all four order types are processed in queu@@ es , with the exception of the output of screen readers . if an application sends the output of a screen reader , during &amp; on ; just such a pre @-@ reading , this output is stopped and termin@@ ated .
first you need to know that filters are never applied to the output of screen readers . they are applied to normal aler@@ ts , messages and text orders as well as on &amp; k@@ de ; messages .
filter the text and pass it on to the next filter . currently , there are three types of filters .
filters are designed as modules . in the future , there are still further types of filters available .
string replacement parts replace parts of a text by other text . you can specify the parts to be replaced either as words or as regular expressions . it is delivered with pre@@ defined string replacement filters , which allow the creation of chat em@@ oti@@ cons such as : - ) by text or for the re @-@ form@@ atting of messages from &amp; conversation ; or &amp; k@@ mail ; in a better understandable way .
&amp; XML ; Trans@@ former use an X@@ SL@@ T file ( XML ; Style Language - Trans@@ forms ) to convert &amp; XML ; from one format to another format . in the scope of delivery of &amp; X@@ HTML ; some X@@ SL@@ T files are included in the translation of &amp; X@@ HTML ; in SS@@ ML .
with language selection filters you can send orders depending on the content of the text or depending on the program that sent the text to &amp; kt@@ ats ; for example , if you have set a female voice on the speaker map for example , you can read K@@ DE messages about it . read more about it .
each of these filters has adjustable rules , after which it is applied to a voice output . if the filter detects that its rules do not apply , it continues the text unchanged at the next filter .
when a text order , a message , warning or a &amp; k@@ de ; noti@@ fications to &amp; kt@@ ats ; sent , it is processed by all activated filters that have been set up on the page below . the processing by the filters is done in the order in the list from top to bottom .
this shows the list of the normal filters installed . if a filter is not checked , it is not activated and is not used . filters are processed in turn from top to bottom .
click here to insert a new filter . select the type of filter , and the next setting di@@ alogs are displayed below .
for the creation of string replacement filters you have to enter a list of words or regular expressions as a comparison pattern . if these patterns are found in the text , then the text is exchanged for the associated replacement text .
enter a name for your filter . you can choose this name as you like , it only needs to differ from the names of the other filters .
this is the list of words and regular expressions . the filter compar@@ es the text with the strings in the column match and replaces it in accordance with the string from the Cre@@ ate column . the list is processed in the displayed order from top to bottom .
click here to post@@ p@@ one the selected word or expression in the list .
with these buttons you can load a list of words or regular expressions from a file , save or delete the current list . load a list from a file , the entries from the file are app@@ ended to the existing list .
if a language is entered here , the filter is only applied if the speaker speaks one of the languages listed here . click on the button to display a list of languages . you can also select multiple languages if you press the &amp; C@@ trl ; key at the click of the mouse .
if a value is entered here , the filter is only applied when the text comes from one of the specified applications . you can enter multiple programs separated by comm@@ a . example : conversation , k@@ mail
the application ID of running programs can be obtained with the program q@@ d@@ bus ; the &amp; d@@ bus ; -@@ numbers must be om@@ itted . if for example &amp; q@@ d@@ bus ; the application ID kop@@ ete @-@ 34@@ 32 shows , you may just enter copying .
the string replacement filter is applied to the text only if all conditions with one entry in the box Use Di@@ esen Fil@@ ters if matching . if all input fields are empty , the filter is applied to all texts .
when comparing words , the string replacement filter uses regular expressions in the form \ \ s word \ \ s. the words must therefore be limited by separ@@ ator ( space ) on both sides .
in this manual you will find no instructions for writing regular expressions . if you have installed the &amp; quot ; Editor &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; regular &amp; # 160 ; Ex@@ pres@@ sions installed , you can call it in the di@@ alogs or edit it as help to assemble these phrases .
&amp; XML ; Conver@@ ters translate &amp; XML ; with the help of X@@ SL@@ T files from a format to another format . X@@ SL@@ T ( XML ; Style Language - Trans@@ forms ) is a W3@@ C standard for such ren@@ ditions . however , it can only be applied to well @-@ formed XML . the x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c utility must be installed on your system .
enter the path for the x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c program . if x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c is accessible via the environment variable PAT@@ H , x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c is enough .
the Spe@@ aker selection filter allows you to send texts to a particular speaker , which is set up on the card card , or to a speaker with specific features . for example , you can specify that the texts should be read by k@@ mail from a female voice . see .
before &amp; on ; a text is passed to the filter , it is looking for a speaker for the text . the speaker is selected using the spokesperson properties that the program sends , which sends the text to &amp; kt@@ ats ; the speaker is selected and the nar@@ r@@ ator is selected by the Spe@@ aker selection filter .
if a value is entered here , the filter is applied if the text contains the entered regular expression . is installed on your system of &amp; k@@ de ; Editor &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; regular &amp; # 160 ; Ex@@ pres@@ sions installed , you can call it with a click on the button to get help in entering .
to get a faster processing you should try to anchor the regular expression at the beginning of the string , i.e. , start the regular expression with &lt; ! &#91; CD@@ ATA &#91; ^ &#93; &#93; &gt; .
specify the characteristics of the speaker you want . if the text meets the filter conditions shown above , the speaker will be selected to match the desired requirements . click on the right @-@ hand button to view the Spe@@ aker Sel@@ ection dialog .
use these buttons to save or load your favorite settings or delete all settings .
the Spe@@ aker selection filter is applied only to the text if all conditions apply with one entry in the box Di@@ esen Fil@@ ters if applicable . you must enter at least one condition .
the speech output API , by &amp; k@@ de ; with which programm@@ ers can lend their applications T@@ TS capabilities . applications communicate with K@@ V@@ SD about &amp; d@@ bus ; .
the K@@ V@@ SD module API , with the Voice synthes@@ izer to be added to K@@ V@@ SD , allowing you to use this synthes@@ izer .
the following section contains a short description of the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ D@@ Bus ; interface of the language output API of &amp; k@@ de ; the complete documentation for both AP@@ Is is found on the k@@ de ; Acc@@ essibility website ( htt@@ p : / / acc@@ essi@@ bil@@ it@@ y.@@ k@@ de@@ .org ) .
applications require language output via the &amp; d@@ bus ; interface from &amp; k@@ de ; from the kt@@ ts@@ d program via the object K@@ Spe@@ ech .
text of the text for reading and option is a language code such as &amp; eg ; en , de &amp; etc ;
there are even more commands you can use . for a list of all commands you enter
open two &amp; Con@@ sole ; window . first run t@@ d in one window , then t@@ sm@@ gr in the other .
none of the mentioned voice synthesis assi@@ sts my language . where can I get a synthes@@ izer for my speech ?
I have set up the &amp; HTML ; -@@ XML ; -@@ Um@@ form@@ er@@ filter , but when using the module for the festival web@@ pages will not be read .
due to an error in Festival 1.@@ 95 beta , you have to install the ( male ) voice ra@@ b _ di@@ phone so that SA@@ BLE works at all . you must do that yourself if you do not use this voice to read websites . also make sure the program x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c is installed and the environment variable PAT@@ H can be found .
certain characters or pun@@ ctu@@ ation tok@@ ens seem to cause mistakes in the synthes@@ izer , so that whole sets are ski@@ pped or only gi@@ b@@ ber@@ ish is spent . what can I do about it ?
first , make sure the character encoding option is set to the right value for the corresponding language . if there are problems with certain characters or words , these may be fixed by a string replacement filter . see .

the Voice synthes@@ iz@@ ers , which are used by &amp; ct@@ ts , have their own license , which you can find in the related documentation or on the relevant websites . there are also voices that have their own license .
if you have access to the K@@ DE source code archive , you can download the k@@ de@@ accessibility package from it . &amp; kt@@ ats ; find the source code from k@@ de@@ accessibility ft@@ p : / / ft@@ p.@@ k@@ de@@ .org / pub / k@@ de / .
contains many languages , a list of all currently supported languages can be found on the project page htt@@ p : / / es@@ pe@@ ak@@ .@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net / langu@@ ag@@ es.@@ html .
American English , British , Spanish , German , Finnish , Czech , Polish , Russian , Italian , French , Canadian French , Kis@@ w@@ ah@@ ili , Zul@@ u and Ibi@@ bio .
K@@ T@@ TS also works with any voice synthesis which can be started on the command line in a &amp; console .
the list of the above mentioned languages may be incomplete or out@@ dated . therefore , consult the description of the synthes@@ izer to the supported languages . see also on the website of kt@@ ats ; , according to information that is not included in this manual .
the &quot; speech @-@ dispens@@ er &quot; program uses a custom@@ iz@@ able module architecture for voice synthesis . if you want to expand the use of another synthes@@ izer , contact the development team .
the x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c User Language program is used for the support of SS@@ ML and for the &amp; XML ; but it is not mandatory . Deb@@ ian users can install x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c using the apt @-@ get install x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c command .
to compile , compile , you need a current K@@ DE development environment ( version 3.4 or later ) , including the k@@ deli@@ bs packages and the development files for the program &quot; speech @-@ dispens@@ er . &quot;
if you have downloaded the source code from &amp; kt@@ ats ; source code for k@@ de@@ accessibility or downloaded the T@@ arb@@ all that is up @-@ to @-@ date , compile and install the program with the following commands :
before reading &amp; kt@@ ats , check first whether it works properly with your speech synthes@@ izer . to do this , you can use the shell script sp@@ d @-@ conf .
&amp; kt@@ ats ; in &amp; k@@ de ; 4.4 is the first version of &amp; kt@@ ats ; the kt@@ t@@ ms@@ gr utility is to be developed in such a way that the set @-@ up of speech @-@ dispens@@ ers is possible and the script sp@@ d @-@ conf is no longer needed .
a long text is divided into individual sets . the user can return sentence or paragraph style , repeat , pause or cancel the output .
if an application gives text to &amp; kt@@ ats , it can specify the characteristics of the preferred speaker for the output . for example , if you have set up a speaker , whose language is English and its gender is female , it will be used , otherwise automatically the appropriate speaker will be chosen . if you want to learn more about how &amp; kt@@ ats ; select a speaker , you will see in .
if you click Add Spe@@ aker on the map file , and thus insert a speaker into the list , or click Edit , the card menu Spe@@ aker setup will be displayed . as an example , the module setup for Festival Interactive is shown below . for details on the modules , see below .
enter the path to the exec@@ utable festival program . if the path to the festival is included in PAT@@ H , you only have to enter the festival .
select the text encoding for text that is passed to the festival . for voices , which are known , this setting is done automatically . generally speaking , western languages are ISO 88@@ 59 @-@ 1 , Eastern languages such as Czech or Slovak use ISO 88@@ 59 @-@ 2 .
use these sli@@ ders to adjust the volume , speech speed and pitch of the synthetic language . if you can &apos;t select some controllers and displayed this grey , the voice selected by you does not allow these settings to be displayed .
some voices like multi@@ sy@@ n voices need to be loaded several seconds because of their size . if you mark this check box , these voices are already loaded at the start of K@@ V@@ SD , so that the first set will be synthes@@ ized faster ( with larger memory usage ) .
if this check box cannot be selected , you have not yet set up a speaker ( or click on Apply to apply ) .
if this check box is selected , the kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr program window will appear at the start of kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr . otherwise , only the symbol kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr in the system section is visible , but not the program window . click the icon in the system section to view the program window .
if this check box is marked and kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr does not run yet , it will appear in the system pane once K@@ V@@ SD reads a text . this gives you the possibility to stop reading or otherwise control it .
here all contracts are listed in the queu@@ e , along with the application that has set the order , the current status of the order , the number of sentences and the currently processed pro@@ position . the spokes@@ man ID corresponds to the ID column on the card card Spe@@ aker .
with buttons in this series , you can proceed or go back or backward in the order selected in the list below . ( but not every order consists of several sets ) .
with one click on OK , all changes of the settings ( also on the other card cards ) are taken over and kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr will be res@@ ized to the icon in the system section . then click on this icon to view the program window again .
if the sound system &amp; arts is not installed , but instead AL@@ SA , G@@ Stre@@ amer or a@@ Ko@@ de , click the audio card audio . see also .
here , only text orders are listed and managed . Edition of screen readers , warnings and messages are not displayed . more information about the message types from &amp; kt@@ ats ; can be found in .
select the type of audio output here . if a component cannot be selected , it has been compiled and kt@@ ats ; either without support for the appropriate audio module , or &amp; kt@@ ats ; cannot load the required libraries .
if G@@ Stre@@ amer or a@@ Ko@@ de is to be used for the audio output , select the audio output here . if no output modules are displayed in the list , you must install at least one module . if you have selected AL@@ SA , select the PC@@ M device here .
adjust the speaking speed here . it is about half and 200@@ 0.1 % about twice the normal speech speed . to allow these settings to be implemented , the program so@@ x must be installed .
click Apply to take over the new settings for the running &amp; on ; system .
the list of AL@@ SA devices includes all PC@@ M devices and modules that are set up in your system . most of them will not work . you will need to find out which device works with you . in doubt , select Standard .
this card card allows you to set up special actions whenever the text order is interrupted by a higher priority message . &amp; kt@@ ats ; processes four types of language orders :
the output of screen readers has the highest priority . it is preferred to all other orders and stops these orders . after the output of the screen reader has been read , the reserved orders are res@@ um@@ ed .
warnings have the next highest priority . this level is important news such as &amp; eg ; processor is exc@@ essi@@ vely reserved . a warning stops the output of messages and normal text . these orders will be continued after reading the warning .
messages have the next priority . a message interrup@@ ts normal text . &amp; mouth ; is an example of an application that speaks news . if you need &amp; eg ; just read a long text on a web page , you can at &amp; k@@ mouth ; nonetheless greet someone who just enters the room .
a text order is interrupted by a message , warning or the output of a screen reader , adds &amp; kt@@ ts ; the audio output into the queu@@ e .
this audio file will always be played when a normal text order is interrupted . if both introduc@@ tory sound and introduc@@ tory message are active , the introduc@@ tory sound is played before the introduc@@ tory message .
the settings on this map are only valid for normal text orders . for messages , warnings and the expenditure of screen readers there are no special actions if they are interrupted by a message with a higher priority .
to read the Noti@@ fy messages , start kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr and click noti@@ fications . the card notification will appear .
select this check box to turn on &amp; quot ; noti@@ fications . if this setting is not selected , the remaining settings are disabled and &amp; ct@@ ts ; read no noti@@ fications .
if this setting is selected , noti@@ fications in which a sound is played will be displayed by &amp; ct@@ ts ; not pre @-@ read .
use these buttons to add or delete events from the list . if you click on the Add button , a dialog appears where you can select the application and the event you want to add to the list .
this event reads the message before , the &amp; Con@@ vers@@ ation ; sent when someone men@@ tions your nick@@ name in an IR@@ C message .
all events for which nothing else is specified in the list will be ignored by &amp; ct@@ ts ;
use this drop @-@ down box to specify what to do when an event hits . you have the following selection options :
if you have selected Custom text , enter the desired text . you can use the following plac@@ eholders :
you can enter here the characteristics of the desired speaker . default cho@@ oses the speaker , which is displayed in the list on the card card speaker as the top@@ most entry .
note that there are three levels for events . if an action is specified for a particular event of a particular application , it will be executed . otherwise , the action will be executed for all other events of the particular application . as a last option , the action will come to fru@@ ition , which was specified under standard ( all other events ) .
the Event All noti@@ fications for the application Standard ( all other events cannot be deleted from the list . for this , you can set the default noti@@ fications as follows :
use the Save button to save the settings for the noti@@ fications to a file . use the Save button to load saved settings from a file . the loaded events will be merged with the events in the list . if you want to start with an empty list , click Del@@ ete . all entries except all noti@@ fications will be deleted .
the Spe@@ ech Syn@@ thesis Mark@@ up Language ( SS@@ ML ) is a W3@@ C standard to highlight text for voice output . this standard contains stamps for controlling voices , speech speed , volume , gender of voice and pitch . furthermore , trademarks for controlling the pron@@ unci@@ ation of for example ab@@ brevi@@ ations . SS@@ ML is part of the Vo@@ ic@@ e@@ XML specification , another W3@@ C standard .
currently supported &amp; kt@@ ts ; SS@@ ML only partially and only in basic functions . the following limitations are available :
you must install the ra@@ b _ di@@ phone voice ( bri@@ tish male ) since this is the standard voice , the festival is used in the edition of SS@@ ML .
if the speed or key settings in the Festival configuration dialog are not set to 100 nbsp ; % , SS@@ ML text is usually spoken very mon@@ oton@@ ously .
&lt; ? &#91; CD@@ ATA &#91; &lt; ? XML version = &quot; 1.0 &quot; encoding = &quot; UT@@ F @-@ 8 &quot; ? &gt; &lt; ! doc@@ type speak PU@@ BLI@@ C &quot; - / / www.@@ w@@ 3.@@ org / TR / speech synthesis / synthesis is@@ .@@ dt@@ d &quot; &gt; Who &apos;s sleeping in my bed ? asked M@@ um Bear . who slept in my bed ? asked the Bear &apos;s . &#93; &#93; &gt;
there are two types of filters - normal filters and set @-@ limit detection filters ( SD@@ B filters ) . this allows you to start reading faster by reading , since only the first set has to be synthes@@ ized , not the entire text order . this allows you to ski@@ p or stop orders in pairs , even if the Voice synthes@@ izer does not support this directly .
here you see the pro@@ posi@@ tional filters . at the first start of &amp; kt@@ at , a set @-@ level detection filter will be set up automatically . you can change its settings or add further set @-@ level detection filters , but beginners will get away from it .
the easiest way to learn how to select the speaker is by selecting it . switch on the box selection and enter text to read . change the language selection , change some properties and check how the speaker &apos;s selection changes . of course , you have to set up more than one speaker , otherwise the filter is in@@ effective .
&amp; kt@@ ats ; then start reading faster with reading , since only the first set has to be processed and not the whole block of text , which can last very long ,
you can pause or cancel text orders on the map map , even if the Voice synthes@@ izer fails to support this function .
for these reasons , the normal movement recognition filter is automatically set up when you start t@@ t@@ sm@@ gr for the first time . it cannot be shut off , only removed . do not change anything about this filter unless you know what you are doing .
pun@@ ctu@@ ation filters compare text with a regular expression for typ@@ ing and add a tab@@ ul@@ ator character ( dec@@ im@@ al code 8 ) to the set limits ( tab@@ ul@@ ators are automatically removed from the text before filtering ) . note that the default password recognition filter maintains the character set .
S@@ BD filters are never applied to &amp; k@@ de ; messages ( k@@ notify ) , warnings , messages or the output of screen readers .
if you have removed the normal rate recognition filter out of sight , you can paste it again by loading the included file standard _ s@@ b@@ dr@@ c .
you can over@@ ride the application settings for the application on the Spe@@ aker Sel@@ ection Card . the map will be shown if
use of the standard speaker ( the top on the card card nar@@ r@@ ator ) . in other words : no speaker features are specified .
using the most appropriate speaker that has all the features of an established speaker . if you do not delete or edit the speaker &apos;s settings , select the speaker . otherwise select &amp; kt@@ ink ; the speaker that best matches the originally set features .
select the method to enter the desired language by clicking on one of the selection buttons .
select the characteristics of the desired speaker here . if this property does not play a role , you do not give anything .
mark this check box if the property is to have priority over other properties . you can also set multiple markings here .
since the language is a critical factor in understanding the output , it is always treated as a prime feature . you will seldom use this property . the only case in which you possibly want to specify the attribute language lies before , if you know that a particular application sends text in another language than the one in the working environment .
to delete all the features in the area of speakers , which is most likely to delete the following , click on the default speaker button and then use the speaker that is closest to the following .
in this case , 0 is for the last word order in the queu@@ e . you can also specify an order number . ( without order number , the input 0 is required ) .
kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr immediately cr@@ ashes when it is started . I have compiled Deb@@ ug support , but I do not get a trace .
G@@ Stre@@ amer has crashed and kt@@ ats ; it ended . probably you need to register G@@ Stre@@ amer . if the problem is not solved by this , a non @-@ compatible version of G@@ Stre@@ amer is probably installed . you can try to update or uninstall the Stre@@ amer .
the audio output about AL@@ SA does not work if I play music simultaneously with another application . if I get a text order , fri@@ ert &amp; kt@@ ats ; a . on the &amp; console ; appears a message saying : Un@@ able to open PC@@ M .
on your system , there is a problem that conflicts occur with AL@@ SA , which prevent simultaneous opening of several PC@@ M devices . information on possible solutions can be found on the website of the AL@@ SA project ( d@@ mix ) at www.@@ al@@ sa @-@ projec@@ t@@ .org .
I have downloaded an additional voice for festival from the Internet . I installed it and can use it in festival , but kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr does not display this voice .
add the new voice in the file $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / apps / kt@@ ts@@ d / fes@@ tival@@ int / Cho@@ ose the new voice . if this is successful , please send a patch along with the &amp; URL where you have found the voice to the developers .
in the audio card audio , there is a setting speed . for this to work , the program must be installed so@@ x and can be discover@@ able via the environment variable PAT@@ H . some Syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ er@@ modul@@ s like Festival Interactive also offer a setting for speed . depending on the selected voice , it is active or in@@ active .
the settings for the speech speed are ignored if &amp; kt@@ ats ; &amp; HTML ; pre @-@ read . ( this is because HTML is converted into SS@@ ML . ) De@@ activate either the filter for the conversion of &amp; HTML ; by &amp; XML ; ( see ) or , if you are quite brave , change the .x@@ s@@ l file of the &amp; HTML ; -@@ after @-@ SS@@ ML re@@ form filter , and set up the talk speed .
I do not create websites with a female voice . I have set up a female festival spokes@@ man , but &amp; kt@@ ats ; read the web pages with a male voice .
at Festival 1.@@ 95 beta , the day SA@@ BLE GEN@@ DER does not seem to work . thus , Festival does not produce errors , re@@ jects the x@@ s@@ l @-@ file for converting SS@@ ML according to S@@ aber @-@ GEN@@ DER @-@ tags . the same goes for VO@@ ICE @-@ tags .
I have added a dedicated string replacement filter and now I can go in &amp; out ; no more way passes - or go back . on the Poster Stand , orders are displayed , the order only consist of one sentence . what am I doing wrong ?
pun@@ ctu@@ ation marks ( dot , question mark , excl@@ am@@ ation mark , comm@@ a and sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ) are not allowed to filter . use a filter for pattern recognition instead .

some users experience in connection with AL@@ SA conflicts with the audio output . if your system also counts , you can &apos;t simultaneously play music and read a text . &amp; ct@@ ts ; also freezes when you pause a text order and then start another . you can find possible solutions for this problem on the AL@@ SA ( d@@ mix ) website .
as of July 2005 , a@@ Ko@@ de does not support real breaks . if you pause a text order in &amp; kt@@ ats , the current sentence will be read al@@ right .
the audio program so@@ x is used for the general setting of the talk speed but is otherwise not mandatory . Deb@@ ian users can install so@@ x using the apt @-@ get install so@@ x . the program is already included in most &amp; Linux ; CDs already .

before reading &amp; kt@@ ats , check first if your voice synthesis is working properly . follow the instructions that you have received with the synthes@@ izer .
Festival is one of the best free T@@ TS synthes@@ iz@@ ers whose source code is open . the quality of the voices is generally good , and several voices and languages are supported . in many voices you can adjust volume , speech speed and pitch with &amp; kt@@ ats .
you must install at least one language . help can be found in the instructions provided with the festival . if you want to read websites , you must install the ( male ) voice ra@@ b _ di@@ phone .
for these voices you have to compile an additional module , so you need the source code of the festival . the German voices are subject to restrictions on passing on .
this voice pres@@ upp@@ oses the festival 1.@@ 95 beta or newer . the voice is still in an early stage of development . un@@ zip the software in festival / lib / r@@ ussi@@ an / . if you set up the Russian votes , you must enter for the voices MS@@ U _ ru _ N@@ SH _ di@@ phone . select a Cy@@ ril@@ lic ( 8 @-@ bit ) encoding as for example KO@@ I@@ 8 @-@ R .
Festival is usually included in the &amp; Linux distri@@ butions . therefore , search the festival first on the CDs of your distribution .
if you want to use the Polish , Hungarian or Czech languages , the encoding option must be set to ISO 88@@ 59 @-@ 2 .
if you want to use the Russian voice , the encoding option must be set to a 8 @-@ bit Cy@@ ril@@ lic such as KO@@ I@@ 8 @-@ R .
Festival can be used together with the &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; synthes@@ izer . then the festival takes on lex@@ ical analysis and MB@@ RO@@ LA ; generates the audio output . the &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; -@@ program and the &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; -@@ voices can be downloaded from

Free@@ T@@ TS is a free , qu@@ el@@ lo@@ fty voice synthesis which was written in &amp; Java ; i.e. you need to install the &amp; Java ; Virtual Machine on your system . with &amp; Java ; you can set neither pitch , volume nor speech speed .
the command module allows you to use &amp; kt@@ ats ; with any voice synthesis , which can be controlled in a &amp; console ; on the command line .
it is best to use a command that writes the voice output to a temporary audio file ( wa@@ v ) instead of sending the output directly to the audio device
this manual explains the installation and use of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; , a module for the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center , which allows management of network interfaces , routing and DNS settings .
the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; allows the user to manage a number of system and desktop settings using a unified , integrated interface . the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; can be inv@@ oked by selecting K Menu k@@ contro@@ l@@ center .
the &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; package was designed to allow users to manage the TCP / IP network settings in the same way as other settings from the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; the areas of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; create a simple interface for the user for the following tasks :
after installation , a new module network settings in &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center will be displayed ; the network network settings ( k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; ) can be started by selecting k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; Internet &amp; Network network settings in &amp; K@@ Menu ;
it is important to understand that &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; network hardware cannot install . physical devices and their drivers must have already been installed and configured to make &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; the device at all indicates and allows setting the network properties .
in most cases , drivers for network hardware and other devices will be installed and installed when installing &amp; Linux . if network devices are added later , the drivers must be loaded by adap@@ ting the following files , according to the kernel version :
the Network Set@@ ting module is loaded if the network settings in the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; index is selected . when starting the module network settings , this will attempt to automatically detect the platform used on the system .
if the platform cannot be detected , the selection will be offered . it is the platform to choose from the list that best matches the distribution and the Rel@@ e@@ as@@ inet . by selecting the setting of non @-@ re @-@ ques@@ tioning , the setting can be made permanently . then the selection will be set automatically at the next start of the network settings .
changing the network settings is only possible in system management mode . before , all options are displayed gray , meaning the settings can only be viewed , changing is not possible . by clicking the button system management mode , you get to the right bottom of the module by clicking the button . it is necessary to enter the password .
in system management mode all the functionality of the module is available . it is divided into three tab@@ s :
the network interface can be used to manage the network devices of the system . all available network devices are displayed . the following tasks can be performed by the network interfaces :
the settings displayed in the network interfaces can be set by selecting the desired device in the list and clicking on the button interface ... set up in the Device Dialog box .
by default , only basic TCP / IP settings are available . click the Advanced Settings button to display the dialog with further options .
with the option Automati@@ cally , the TCP / IP settings are fet@@ ched from a DH@@ CP server or BO@@ O@@ TP server . in automatic mode , TCP / IP settings are performed at the same time with the start of the system services . the DH@@ CP or BO@@ O@@ TP server sends all necessary TCP / IP information at each system start , so no further adjustment is required . in the selection list , either DH@@ CP or BO@@ O@@ TP , according to the system , can be selected .
with the manual selection , the TCP / IP configuration can be done without dh@@ c@@ p or BO@@ O@@ TP . in the input field IP address , the desired TCP / IP address must be specified . in the input field of the net@@ mask the sub@@ net mask must be specified .
if this setting is selected , the system initi@@ alizes the network interface while bo@@ oting . if the initi@@ alization is not desired , this option should not be enabled .
the values entered in this dialog are displayed as the properties of the device in the device list .
it should be ensured that the IP address on the network is not already used . entering an already existing IP address would lead to a TCP / IP conflict . with ping in the &amp; console , you can determine if the desired address is already in use . in doubt , the network administrator should be asked .
network devices can be activated or switched off as required . turn on an out@@ dated network device by selecting from the list and clicking on the interface ...
network devices can be turned on or off as required . turn off an activated network device by selecting from the list and clicking on the interface ...
speci@@ fies the IP address of the host in the local sub@@ net that con@@ veys the physical connection to remote networks and is used by default for TCP / IP communication with computers in other sub@@ nets .
if there is more than one network interface on the computer , the interface to the network in which the gateway computer is located must be selected .
a computer with DNS support replaces a full domain name by the corresponding IP address . this is necessary because computers can only understand IP addresses . if the computer asks htt@@ p : / / www.@@ ein@@ ed@@ om@@ ain@@ .org , DNS dis@@ sol@@ ves this name into an IP address such as 12@@ 3.@@ 45.@@ 67@@ 8.@@ 90 .
the name resolution machine part of the name resolution allows an easy administration of this list . entries can be added , removed or changed .@@ DNS records can be re @-@ ordered by selecting a entry and boun@@ cing or down@@ gra@@ ding in the list with the buttons Re@@ wards or Excel .
by clicking on the button Add ... a DNS server can be added from the group machine to name resolution . it will be added to the New Name Server dialog .
first you need to enter the IP address of the DNS server and then click the Add button . the entry will then be inserted in the list .
from the group computer to the name resolution , select an entry and then click Edit .... It will be displayed in the Edit dialog .
the list of name @-@ known calcul@@ ators describes the host@@ name @-@ to @-@ IP address links for the TCP / IP sub@@ system . it is primarily used for boot when no DNS servers are available . in small , remote networks it can replace DNS servers .
normally the list contains some known calcul@@ ators some entries that support and ap@@ os ; loc@@ al@@ host@@ ap@@ os ; and some special IP@@ v@@ 6 addresses . this still in the test is supposed to replace version 4 in the future .
enter the IP address of the known machine and click Add .... Add the Add new alias .
enter the name of the known machine and click the Add button . if the known machine has several alias names , press the Add button repeatedly and enter the alias names .
select an entry of a particular known machine from the list and select Edit .... The dialog to edit the machine will be shown .
it can be done one of the following tasks , then by clicking OK the list of static hosts will be updated .
the settings that are made in the network settings are not effective immediately in the system . in order to activate the changes , the following command must be set in a &amp; console .
the website of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; is htt@@ p : / / k@@ net@@ work@@ conf@@ .@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net , from which you can download the latest version of the source code .
for the installation of binary distri@@ butions ( mostly rpm packages ) it is enough if &amp; k@@ de ; and Q@@ t are installed .
the installation of the fully compiled version is recommended for less experienced users . it is easy to download the rpm package and install it in a &amp; console ; with rpm as follows :
alternatively , a graphical interface tool such as k@@ package or the installation tool of your distribution can be used .
in this case , the installation of Q@@ t and &amp; k@@ de does not suff@@ ice ; in addition , the development packages are needed with libraries and others .
this is only recommended to experienced users . however , it is not difficult to compile and k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; the following commands should do this .
in the first section of this chapter , important information about basic network technology is given , in the second section , all of the &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf and configuration files will be discussed .
this section cannot replace further knowledge of IP networks . in this app@@ endi@@ x , only basic information about the integration of the PC in a small ( home ) network is convey@@ ed .
IP networks are currently being operated with TCP / IP version 4 ( IP@@ v@@ 4 ) . IP@@ v@@ 6 has never found widespread dis@@ sem@@ ination . IP@@ v@@ 6 is expected to go through in the near future . therefore , this description is currently concent@@ rating on the common IP@@ v@@ 4 .
one of the most important information is knowing which IP address of a network interface is to assign . in foreign networks , at &amp; eg ; work@@ station , the network administrator is the point of contact , which has a valid IP address , or if available , the IP address can not simply be chosen arbit@@ rar@@ ily !
when setting up your own small ( home ) network , the IP address should be selected from a specially reserved area for this purpose in order to avoid IP address conflicts with the global ( Internet ) network . the addresses from the table below are not forwarded on the Internet , therefore their any use is possible .
of course you can access the Internet for such machines by setting a g@@ ate@@ ways .
for smaller networks , IP addresses are usually used in 19@@ 2.16@@ 8.@@ 1.1 to 19@@ 2.16@@ 8.@@ 1.@@ 254 . the area is large enough for networks up to 250 computers .
in addition , the net@@ mask is mostly set to 25@@ 5.@@ 25@@ 5.@@ 25@@ 5.0 so that all hosts are participants in the same sub@@ net .
some addresses are reserved for special things , 0.0@@ eg ; .0.@@ 0 and 127@@ .0@@ .0@@ .1 . the first is the so @-@ called standard route , the second the lo@@ op@@ back address ( loc@@ al@@ host = your own calcul@@ ator ) . the default route is required for the IP @-@ forwar@@ ding .
the network address 127@@ .0@@ .0@@ .1 is reserved for the IP traffic in the local machine . normally , the address 127@@ .0@@ .0@@ .1 is assigned to an own so @-@ called lo@@ op@@ back interface , which works like a closed circle .
this section contains the configuration files that are affected by &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf and where they are stored in the various distri@@ butions .
this file is sometimes dynam@@ ically changed for DSL connections so that it won &apos;t be surprised if in case of active DSL connections there is another content to be found there .
for &amp; Su@@ SE ; it is known that this file is random@@ ly sorted by the Scrip@@ ts in Su@@ SE . another stand than expected can therefore occur .

&amp; k@@ dat ; is a backup program for tape drives on the basis of tar . it offers the possibility to create multiple archives on one tape . the first was to create a surface for tar which offered the ability of dd@@ s@@ 2@@ tar for fast , selective packing . the second goal was to answer a question that my wife put : how much longer does it take when you secure ?
before a tape can be used it must be connected by &amp; k@@ dat ; it can happen in three ways :
&amp; k@@ dat ; trains the tape back and reads the pre@@ st@@ ressing information of the tape . detects &amp; k@@ dat ; you don &apos;t know the pre @-@ spell on the tape , you will be asked if the tape is to be format@@ ted .
detect &amp; k@@ dat ; pre @-@ spell , search for the appropriate index on your disk . if this is not found , you will be asked if the index should be recre@@ ated .
if everything went smoothly the symbol for the tape drive changes to indicate that the tape has been integrated . in the status bar , a corresponding message appears . the contents of the tape can now be searched by fl@@ aps of the entry for the tape .
before ej@@ ecting the tape , the integration must first be solved . there are three methods to accomplish this :
&amp; k@@ dat ; passes through a change of the symbol for the tape that the integration for the tape has been solved and displays a corresponding message in the status bar . the tape can now be ej@@ ected without danger .
before a Tape from &amp; k@@ dat ; can be used , it must be format@@ ted by &amp; k@@ dat .
a band type needs to be format@@ ted before you can be used to save data . if your tape drive requires a format to be format@@ ted before use , this must happen before you can format a tape before use . flo@@ ppy disk drives usually require form@@ atting of tape , but DAT drives do not .
after entering the band name and capacity goes &amp; k@@ dat ; with the format of the tape . all the data on the tape are lost ! after completion of the form@@ atting process , the tape is automatically integrated and ready to use .
before you start the backup process , you need to select the files to be secured . this can happen in three ways :
select a file or folder in the local file tree . only this file or folder will be backed up .
select a backup profile in the tree . only the files specified in the profile are secured .
select files in the local file tree with a tick . only the selected files and / or sub@@ folders will be backed up .
right @-@ click on the local file tree and select in the Backup menu ...
once the backup is started , the dialog opens for backup . in this dialog , you can check the selected files again and change the settings for backup .
when you confirm the settings , the Backup function will appear . the dialog shows the progress of the backup process , including the data rate and the time remaining .
select a file or folder in one of the archives in the entry for the drive . only the selected file or folder will be checked .
select the files in one of the archives in the entry for the band with a tick . only the selected files and / or sub@@ folders are checked .
right click in one of the archives and select the menu item to check ....
once the scan process has started , the dialog box dialog appears . in this dialog , you can check your selection again and change the working folder for review .
if you confirm the review settings , the dialog box will appear . this dialog shows the progress of the audit process as well as the data throughput and the remaining time .
before you can initiate the restore , the files that are to be restored must be marked . this can be done in two ways :
select a file or folder in one of the archives belonging to the tape drive . it will only restore the selected file or sub@@ folder .
select the files you want from one of the archives with a tick . only the selected files and / or sub@@ folders will be restored .
right @-@ click on a file or folder in one of the archives and select Rest@@ ore ....
once the restore process has started , the dialog for Recovery will appear . in this dialog , you can once again check your selection and change the working folder for recovery .
once you have confirmed the restore settings , the Rest@@ ore dialog will appear . this dialog displays the progress of the recovery process as well as the data throughput and the remaining time .
sometimes it is necessary to recre@@ ate the index file using the band content . this process del@@ etes all existing index files for this volume . you can add the index to two types of tape :
this creates a backup profile with the currently selected files and the default settings . you can make the following settings for a backup profile :
the current working folder where backup is to take place . the list of files to be secured will be automatically updated according to the newly selected working folder .
for all files listed under backup files , only those files located in the same fil@@ esystem , such as the folder . folders located on other fil@@ es@@ ystems can be entered separately under backup files . each entry is considered by tar independent from the others .
performing a incre@@ mental backup . to determine which files have changed since the last incre@@ mental backup , a snap@@ shot file is used . only the files that have changed since then are backed up .
the name of the file used to as@@ certain the changes since the last incre@@ mental backup .
del@@ etes the snap@@ shot file before the tar call . this causes all files to be backed up and a new snap@@ shot file is created for the next backup .
the functionality of the buttons files &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; lt ; files have not yet been fully implemented at the time creating this documentation .
the settings can be set via the menu item K@@ D@@ at ... in the Settings menu . you can make the following settings :
the complete path to device file for tape drive ( normally / dev / tape ) . this path must refer to the non @-@ winding version of the tape .
this setting is active , transmitted &amp; k@@ dat ; before the tape is included , the command mt load to the drive . in some drives , this is necessary before read or write operations can be performed .
if the option is turned on , try &amp; k@@ dat ; to lock the ej@@ ection during tape drive . possibly this setting does not work with all tape drives .
if the option is turned on , when releasing the integration of &amp; k@@ dat ; automatically ej@@ ected the tape . do not use this option on flo@@ ppy stream@@ ers .
if the option is turned on , try &amp; k@@ dat ; change the hardware file size for the tape drive . not all drives support variable block sizes . no matter if this setting is active or not , you have to tell &amp; k@@ dat ; in any case tell the block size for your tape drive .
when &amp; k@@ dat ; form@@ atting a band , it writes a file to the beginning of the tape . this file should only occupy a memory block on the tape . the contents of the file are composed as follows :
( n Byte ) The band ID . the format of this string is the host@@ name : seconds , where host@@ name is the full name of the system on which the tape has been format@@ ted . seconds is the number of seconds that have passed since the era in which the band was format@@ ted .
the band ID is used to find a file with the same name in the folder $ HO@@ ME / .@@ k@@ dat .
the remaining files on the tape are pure tar archives , which can be managed directly with &amp; GNU ; - tar . even other tar versions should work as long as they are not incre@@ mental back@@ ups .
check the contents of a backup band . this symbol is only active when a band is involved .
&amp; k@@ system@@ log ; is a &amp; k@@ de ; viewer for system logs . the program is suitable for in@@ experienced users who do not know where to get information about your system or where the system leaves the different protocol files . furthermore , &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; experienced users can quickly access information about problems that occur on their server .
&amp; k@@ system@@ log ; helps users understand what makes your computer in the background . the task of &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; is a simplified presentation of the protocol files of your own system . the program is suitable for in@@ experienced users who do not know where you can get information about your system or where the system depos@@ ited the different protocol files .
in addition , enables &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; experienced users can quickly access information about problems that occur on their server . &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; therefore attempts to provide some advanced functions with which help the protocol files of certain programs can be filtered and evaluated .
in the current version 0.@@ 4.1 has &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; a number of useful functions . these include :
support for many different types of log files , for the format of the Sy@@ slo@@ g server and for Sam@@ ba
many other functions are also included and are explained in the other chapters of this manual .
as you can see in the following scre@@ enshot , use &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; functions to easily filter and sort the single protocol @-@ lines of a log file . the individual options for sorting and filtering are shown in the next chapter of this manual .
after the start &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; first the most important log file of the system - the system log - will open . if you do not see it , and it opens instead of it a small message window , you have &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; very likely not with system administrator rights . the log files are usually found under Linux in the / var / log folder , for normal users usually do not have permission to read .
you can also use the Filter Panel to filter after a selected criteri@@ on or after typ@@ ed strings . the list of the log lines will now be changed automatically so that only the log lines will be displayed next to the filter . in the default setting , a log line will only be displayed if in one of the columns the string of the filter search term is included .
you can also select another entry at this point . the string of the Filter search term will then only match the entries in the corresponding column . for example , select the process column in the protocol file , and enter the name of a process in the Filter Panel , so you will show you &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; all protocol lines that were sent or created by this process .
this option is enabled in the default setting and helps you to recognize the important protocol lines . level errors are displayed with a more con@@ spic@@ uous color than protocol lines of the level indicator . the color display of protocol @-@ lines can be turned off the setup dialog .
if you want to display only certain process ( for example in the system log or in the C@@ ron Protocol ) , you can hide the process identification ( PID ) in the process column . this may be useful , for example , if you want to examine the output of a particular command such as the start of the sam@@ ba server . in this case , use the Filter@@ Panel .
in addition , you can enable the Add to new lines in the main window context menu to view all new protocol lines .
&amp; k@@ system@@ log ; allows to display multiple log files in separate sub@@ windows . to use this function , use the entries in the menu Window to open and manage additional sub@@ windows . once you have selected a sub @-@ window , select a protocol to display in the menu .
&amp; k@@ system@@ log ; has its own website on htt@@ p : / / k@@ system@@ log@@ .@@ forum @-@ softwar@@ e.@@ or@@ g. There you will find further up @-@ to @-@ date information on the sources of &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; .
&amp; k@@ system@@ log ; can also be found in the following folder des &amp; k@@ de ; Subversion archive : k@@ system@@ log ; im &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ archive
welcome to &amp; k@@ de ; System V In@@ it Editor , rather known ( and so named ) as &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; . this section introduces a few concepts and describes what you can do with &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v .
the system V In@@ it quickly becomes the standard for the control of the program start when running the system in the &amp; Linux ; this is because it is easier to use , more powerful , and at the same time more flexible than the traditional BSD in@@ it .
I will not go further into historical aspects here ( e.g. because I don &apos;t know about it : - ) .
the in@@ it binary file is under / s@@ bin and not under / etc . this is important because maybe someone might attempt to switch a machine to system V In@@ it without a re@@ installation and reform@@ atting . the &amp; Linux kernel looks first on / etc after a in@@ it file . therefore , you need to make sure that the old in@@ it was removed from there , if there was one .
Sys@@ V In@@ it also differs from the BSD In@@ it that the configuration files are located in a sub@@ folder of / etc rather than directly in / etc . this folder is named r@@ c.@@ d. D@@ ort you will find r@@ c.@@ sy@@ sin@@ it and the following folders :
in@@ it@@ .@@ d includes a lot of scripts . basically , you need a script for any system service you want to start when running the system or changing to another run@@ level . system services include such things as network , NFS , &amp; Send@@ mail ; on the other hand , system services do not include such things as set@@ serial , which only starts once . such calls are r@@ c.@@ local .
r@@ c.@@ local should be in / etc / r@@ c.@@ d if you need it . most systems have this file , even if there is not much use for it . you can also create a r@@ c.@@ serial in / etc / r@@ c.@@ d if you want to run a r@@ c.@@ serial port in / etc / r@@ c.@@ d if you want to do something with the serial port .
the kernel searches in different places after the program in@@ it and starts the first one it finds .
the default run@@ level is entered in / etc / in@@ itt@@ ab . you should see a line like the following :
at this point , you can take a look at the second column and probably find out that the pre @-@ set Run@@ level 3 is . if you want to change that then you can edit / etc / in@@ itt@@ ab by hand and change the 3 . if you have confused something , then get it repaired by rest@@ art@@ ing the system and running the following :
but how does it start all the right scripts ? if you type ls -@@ l in r@@ c@@ 3.@@ d , then you probably see something like the following :
you will notice that there are no real files in this folder . instead , each entry is linked to one of the scripts in the in@@ it@@ .@@ d directory .
how to start and stop in@@ it actually system services ? quite simple : each of the scripts is written in such a way that it accepts an argument such as start and stop . you can actually start these scripts by hand on the command line as follows :
this would stop the htt@@ p@@ d server . in@@ it reads the name , and if it contains a K , the script is called with the argument stop . if it contains an S , the script is called with the start argument .
some people want to set up machines for many purposes . I could &amp; eg ; have a server -@@ run level running just htt@@ p@@ d , &amp; Send@@ mail ; , network &amp; etc . in addition , I could also have a user running level , the &amp; eg ; &amp; k@@ dm ; , Network &amp; etc ; starts .
here you learn how to use &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; it should not be very difficult because the program was created as user @-@ friendly as possible .
the use of &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; with a mouse or another poin@@ ter is easy to say not tri@@ vial : just drag an entry from the area of available system services to one of the six running levels to start it at this level ( or stop it ) .
you can also move scripts between Run@@ le@@ vel@@ n or change the position within a level by drag@@ ging it somewhere else . thus , the entry is removed from its original Run@@ level ( or its position ) . this only happens when they extract an entry from the area of the available system services .
note : entries will be postpon@@ ed if you drag them into a new domain . to merely copy them to a new Run@@ level , you must explicitly select Copy from the Edit menu or from the context menu and paste it into the target area -- even if the same entry has already existed in the target range of the action .
the sorting number of an entry can sometimes not be calculated . in such a case , you need to edit the sorting numbers of the surrounding entries before you can try again to insert the system service .
note : at present there is no way to restore entries that were thrown into the recy@@ cle bin . so be careful .
you can use the Tab key to activate the various work@@ spaces ( available system services , Run@@ level 1 Start , Run@@ level 1 Stop &amp; etc ; ) as well as the cur@@ sor keys to make a selection above or below the previous one .
to move an entry into another run@@ level , move it to the clip@@ board ( you can also use C@@ trl ; X ) and insert it into the desired Run@@ level with Insert ( with C@@ trl ; V ) .
to change the sorting number or the name of an entry manually , press the Enter key to change the properties dialog . use the Tab key to switch between different fields . close the dialog by pressing the input key to accept the changes , or press Es@@ c to disc@@ ard the changes .
because of the risk of data loss , all entries in the File menu require confirmation before they are executed .
all settings are stored in $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / config / k@@ sy@@ sv@@ rc . default settings are retri@@ eved from the global file ( $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / config / k@@ sy@@ sv@@ rc ) if available . otherwise , they will be recovered by &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; saved in a local k@@ sy@@ sv@@ rc .
I experim@@ ented with the standard Run@@ le@@ vel@@ n , and now the machine starts constantly new . what can I do ?
enter the LI@@ LO -@@ Pro@@ mp@@ t lin@@ ux single and press the input key to start in single @-@ user mode . then edit the file / etc / in@@ itt@@ ab and change the default run@@ level to a reasonable value ( 3 should normally be okay ) .
I have some system services with &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; for execution under Run@@ level X , but they are not executed .
if you are using Su@@ SE or Del@@ ix ( DL@@ D ) then you will need to edit additional files in / etc , which are only available in these distri@@ butions . please read the details in the manual of the distribution .
the way system services are started in these distri@@ butions , simpli@@ fies the configuration for the proprietary programming programs of these distri@@ butions , but unfortunately does not meet any standard . &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v &apos;s authors plan an extension of the program for this approach .
if you are using another distribution , please check that all configuration files are present , which are required by the system service ( and also if they are in the correct directory ) . some services ( such as &amp; eg ; Apache and htt@@ p@@ d ) simply termin@@ ate without message if their configuration files are not present or set up in@@ correctly .
the meaning of &amp; Linux ; -@@ Run@@ level varies from distribution to distribution , may even be different from version to version . if you are using another distribution , please send me information about the running level so that this manual can be added .
this documentation refers to &amp; k@@ user ; 1.0 . with this program you can manage the users and groups of your system .
to begin with &amp; k@@ user , it is sufficient to read the chapter Custom@@ ization of &amp; k@@ user ;
after you have made changes , you need to save them . either use the corresponding symbol of the tool@@ bar or the save entry in the File menu .
&amp; k@@ user ; is a simple application . the main window consists of two card cards , the user and the user group list . for editing , select the desired user or group with a double @-@ click on the entry .
some card cards are only displayed if you have advanced system settings . only if you have enabled space limitations ( quot@@ a ) for users , a card map will be created on which you can make individual settings . further flash@@ cards appear if shadow passwords or for example / etc / master@@ .@@ pass@@ wd are installed as in BSD @-@ uni@@ xes .
the password management card menu appears , if shadow passwords or for example / etc / master@@ .@@ pass@@ wd are installed as in BSD @-@ uni@@ xes .
this map only appears if for at least one embedded file system space limitation ( quot@@ a ) is enabled and initi@@ alized ( recognizable by the file quot@@ a user / quot@@ a group on the file system ) . here , parameters can be changed for each user , whereby the space limitations are in KB :
these parameters can be set individually for each fil@@ esystem . the current file system is selected with space limitation using the File System field .
the Card Map Groups inform about the group affili@@ ations of the selected user . the standard group , to which the user belongs , can be found in the Pri@@ mary group field . furthermore , the user can become a member in other groups by selecting them in the large box .
the Group dialog features a list of all users . to add a user to the group , select this user in the list .
to add a user or group , select Add from the user or group menu or click the appropriate add button of the tool@@ bar . editing or del@@ eting the selected user or group works analog@@ ously .
with this module you can install the LI@@ LO System Manager , add , remove and modify the boot password , change the time to boot the standard operating system , add , remove , change operating systems , remove , change , and more .
